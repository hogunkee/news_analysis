3,NOC,"It was Jan. 17, 1991. America was at war in Iraq. The mission: Operation Desert Storm. Lockheed's F-117 Nighthawk, the first stealth fighter, showcased America's superior air power to Saddam Hussein and the rest of the world.The unconventionally shaped stealth plane would make 1,300 sorties, hitting 1,600 high-value targets during the campaign. It accounted for 40% of all targeted damage, without a single hit by enemy fire.Stealth played a key role in the military's second offset strategy, where a small number of high-tech platforms could beat the massive military hardware the Soviets boasted. Stealth marked a new era in air warfare and is a foundation of U.S. air supremacy to this day.But the game-changing F-117 wouldn't have been possible without Ben Rich, the second director of Lockheed's secretive Skunk Works, who took a major risk despite the discouragement of some of the brightest minds in aerospace.Rich was born on June 18, 1925, in Manila, Philippines, to a British hardwood lumber mill superintendent and a French linguist.As tensions rose in the Pacific, his family moved to Los Angeles just months before the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor. There he went to work with his father in a machine shop to help support the family during the war years. His shelved his dream to go to college to become a doctor.At 21 Rich was finally able to attend college. He graduated in 1949 with a mechanical engineering degree from the University of California, Berkeley. He later received a master's degree in aerothermodynamics from the University of California, Los Angeles, where he met his first wife, Faye.The postwar recession made jobs scarce. But Rich managed to find an engineering job at Lockheed (LMT) in 1950. Because he wasn't earning enough to support his growing family, he gave notice after just four years of employment. He was all set to take over his father-in-law's bakery-delicatessen. At the last second, Rich changed his mind. Truth was, he liked building airplanes better than selling deli meats.Soon after deciding to stay at Lockheed, he joined Skunk Works at the request of founder Kelly Johnson.Skunk Works, formally called the Advanced Development Programs, is Lockheed's legendary research and development lab. Created in 1943 to develop the company's top-secret technology during World War II, it was the birthplace of the P-38 fighter. Employees at the secretive unit refer to themselves as ""Skunks.""The division started in a circus tent outside the main Lockheed building in Burbank, next to a smelly plastics factory. Their unique moniker comes from a stinky concoction make by a bootlegger in the ""Li'l Abner"" comic strip.Under Johnson, Rich worked on the highflying U-2 spy plane, which the Air Force plans to keep flying for more than 100 years.He also designed the air-inlet control system for the SR-71 Blackbird, which can fly three times the speed of sound. In his autobiography, ""Skunk Works: A Personal Memoir of My Years at Lockheed,"" Rich called his contribution to the SR-71 the most ""exhausting, difficult and nerve-wracking work"" of his career.Rich won the American Institution of Aeronautics and Astronautics Award in 1972 for the Blackbird's propulsion system. His work on the F-117 would win Rich aerospace's top award, the prestigious Collier Trophy, in 1989. Kelly Johnson tapped Rich as his replacement in 1975. Rich was a popular choice. Most of the Skunks chose to stay during the major transition.""Tip your hat to someone like Ben keeping an operation going after such a strong leader like Kelly,"" said Larry Pellett, the current director of major projects at Skunk Works. Rich asked Pellett to join Skunk Works after seeing him give a presentation in 1989.Johnson was an autocratic leader. He was very hands-on with his technical workers. He reworked submitted designs, striking fear into some of the younger employees. But Pellett said Rich's success resided in the fact that he never tried to be like Johnson. Instead he adopted his own managerial style.""There is a joke among Skunks that Kelly managed with his bad temper, and Ben managed with bad jokes,"" Pellett said. ""He was the cheerleader, the facilitator that built the team up.""Other employees felt the same way about Rich's brand of leadership.""Ben kept a close eye on all our problems, but he was never a second-guesser,"" Alan Brown, Rich's program manager, said in Rich's autobiography. ""Rich let us do our thing and smooth our way with the Air Force and Lockheed management.""Rich took the reins during a tumultuous time for Lockheed. Spending on the unpopular Vietnam War was winding down. And the company found itself in the midst of a bribery scandal.To add to the company's woes, Lockheed hadn't won a fighter contract since the F-104 Starfighter, built during the Korean War. But a major breakthrough was on the horizon.The aviation community considers Rich the father of stealth. But the idea came from an unlikely source. Pyotr Ufimtsev, a Soviet scientist, theorized about stealth technology in a 1962 paper called ""Method of Edge Waves in the Physical Theory of Diffraction."" The paper outlined equations on how to calculate radar cross-sections, an object's ability to reflect radar. But the Soviets deemed the paper impractical and of little use. Ufimstev's discovery would have stayed buried in a Soviet library, if not for Rich.Denys Overholser, a radar specialist, brought the research paper to Rich just six months after Rich took the helm at the Skunk Works. Overholser suggested the company use the equations to build their own stealth plane that could evade the Soviet Union's radar.""I take credit for immediately recognizing the value of the gift I was handed before it became apparent to everyone else, and for taking major risks in expanding development costs before we had any real government interest or commitment,"" Rich said in his autobiography.The result was a model made from a series of flat surfaces that looked like a cut diamond. It was nicknamed ""Rich's Folly"" and ""Hopeless Diamond,"" among other things. The oddly shaped plane is now sometimes compared to a flying Darth Vader.Despite having a working model, Lockheed hadn't been invited to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's (DARPA) competition to build a stealthy plane. All development contract money had been awarded by the time Rich heard of the contest.Rich convinced DARPA head George Heilmeier to let Lockheed join the competition. Rich also smartly rejected DARPA's pro forma $1 offer. Instead he submitted his proposal for free, ensuring the technology would remain the property of Lockheed.Never straying too far from Skunk Works, Johnson caught wind of the stealth plane. He furiously told Rich to shut down development. Johnson erroneously believed missiles were the future of warfare. The ugly, flat-paneled airplane would never fly, he thought.Larry Kitchen, Lockheed's president at the time, was also a skeptic. He said the company needed ""real projects, not pipe dreams,"" Rich recalled in his autobiography.But Rich persevered despite the naysayers. He believed in the game-changing technology. Rich spent nearly 1 million dollars of Skunk Works' development cash on the stealth project. He envisioned huge military and financial returns in the future.""I never wavered from believing that stealth could create the biggest Skunk Works bonanza ever,"" Rich wrote.Despite being shut out of the DARPA competition at first, ""Rich's Folly"" eventually beat Northrop's submission. After two successful experimental prototypes, built quickly from off-the-shelf items at Skunk Works, the F-117 program was born.But while Rich was about to make a major military breakthrough, he suffered a major personal loss. His wife Faye passed away in 1980. Rich pressed on in his work to manage his grief.The F-117 first flew in 1981 and entered service in 1983. Kept in the dark, the plane wouldn't see its first mission until 1989 in Panama. It wouldn't become an international sensation until the Gulf War. And as the first F-117s took to the skies over Iraq in 1991, Rich and his Skunks celebrated his retirement.Rich had some setbacks during his time at the Skunk Works. Lockheed lost out on the B-2 bomber contract to Northrop (NOC) because he refused to overpromise on price and capabilities. The B-2 would become a casualty of a ""death spiral,"" where decreased military spending by Washington led to less planes being purchased, leading to a higher cost per plane. The B-2 would eventually go on to cost billions of dollars more than first budgeted as Congress kept cutting the number of planes ordered.""I never lied to a customer or tried to dodge the heat when we screwed up,"" he wrote. ""I knew how other companies operated, and I was convinced that our reputation for integrity would gain more business than we would ever lose by turning away questionable ventures. And I was right.""Rich died of cancer on Jan. 5, 1995, but his legacy lives on at Skunk Works. Stealth brought Lockheed back into the fighter jet business. The company built the F-22 and F-35 stealth fighters. The latter accounts for a quarter of Lockheed Martin's yearly revenue.Following Rich's belief in the need to find the next revolutionary advancement, Skunk Works is developing the next disruptive technologies, from hypersonics to artificial intelligence, in an effort to stay ahead of growing advances by U.S. adversaries like Russia and China.Engineer who believed stealth technology would be a game-changer on the battlefieldOvercame: Skepticism and the shadow of his revered mentor.Lesson: Recognized the power of a new technology and stuck to his project despite doubts from respected members in his field.""I was convinced that our reputation for integrity would gain more business than we would ever lose by turning away questionable ventures.""YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Defense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsWhat Lockheed's Secretive Skunk Works Unit Sees For The 6th-Gen.

4,NOC,"Lockheed Martin (LMT), Raytheon (RTN) and Northrop Grumman (NOC) have received multibillion-dollar radar contracts as the Pentagon continues to bulk up its missile defense despite President Trump's claim the North Korea threat is over.XThe defense giants were each awarded deals worth up to $4.1 billion to ""provide autonomous acquisition and persistent precision tracking and discrimination to optimize the defensive capability of the Ballistic Missile Defense system,"" the Defense Department said late Tuesday.The companies will compete against each other until the Pentagon narrows the award down to a single contractor's radar.While it's not explicitly stated, the contract is for a replacement to Raytheon's massive Sea-Based X-Band Radar, which floats on a nine-story oil rig platform designed by Boeing (BA).The X-Band Radar ""is getting old and costly to operate. So they are moving to a ground-based solution there,"" said Tom Karako, a senior fellow and missile defense analyst at CSIS.The new radar will be deployed in Hawaii and have a 180-degree field of view toward North Korea, he said. He added that there might be a second radar planned for somewhere in the Pacific.Raytheon shares closed down 1% on the stock market today. Northrop fell 1.1%, Lockheed eased 0.7% and Boeing dropped 1.9% as President Trump threatened more tariffs on Chinese goods.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe $2.2 billion X-Band Radar is an important component in the Missile Defense Agency's layered Ballistic Missile Defense System to protect the U.S. homeland.It's considered the largest and most sophisticated radar of its kind and successfully intercepted a test-fired missile last year.The contract award for its replacement comes after Trump's summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un last month. Trump later tweeted there ""is no longer a Nuclear Threat from North Korea.""However, satellite images have since shown North Korea upgrading the plutonium production reactor and support buildings at its Yongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research Center.While all the defense contractors picked have extensive missile defense experience, Lockheed has scored some key radar contracts recently.Lockheed is currently building the Long Range Discrimination Radar in Alaska. But Karako said the radar is too far north to see missiles headed to Hawaii from North Korea.Lockheed is also reportedly building its long-range radar for two of Japan's planned Aegis Ashore missile defense systems.Despite the large price tag, the X-Band Radar replacement can't be used against other emerging threats, such as hypersonic boost glide vehicles or a cruise missile attack, Karako said.""The Pentagon's missile defense review isn't out yet, but it was specifically tasked by Congress to look at the full range of missiles,"" he said.To counter sophisticated emerging threats from near-peer adversaries like China and Russia, space-based sensors will be needed as ground-based radars are limited by the curvature of the earth.Still, ground-based radars like the one slated for Hawaii will still be necessary as they augment space-based radars' coverage.Space-based sensors have been discussed by every administration since President Reagan's but haven't made it off the drawing board.""I predict this year a decision will be made,"" Karako saidYOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Defense And Aerospace Stocks To WatchThis U.S. Ally Buys Boeing Spy Planes As China Tension Heats UpAir Force Urges This New Hypersonic Weapons Mindset, Faster RolloutAs North Korea Threat Looms, Here's How U.S. Missile Defense Works

5,NOC,"SpaceX's Falcon Heavy rocket received a massive boost with a $130 million military contract, just 4-1/2 months after its maiden flight.XThe private company, whose founder is Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, has been tasked with delivering the classified Air Force Space Command-52 satellite, according to an Air Force announcement late Thursday. The project is scheduled for completion by September 2020.Earlier in the week, the Air Force also certified the Falcon Heavy for national-security missions, despite the fact that the new rocket has only carried out one test launch in early February.SpaceX beat the United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Boeing (BA) and Lockheed Martin (LMT), in what is believed to be their first head-to-head contest for a heavy-lift mission. SpaceX's $130 million mission cost is much less than the $350 million minimum of a ULA Delta IV Heavy launch.The Air Force contract marks an additional vote of confidence after the Zuma spy satellite made by Northrop Grumman (NOC) was reportedly lost after launch by a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket in January.SpaceX said at the time that it ""did everything correctly,"" and reports later suggested the problem may have been with Northrop's custom-built adapter that was used to link its satellite with the Falcon 9.Boeing shares were up 0.4% on the stock market today, while Lockheed's shares were down 0.4%.The massive Falcon Heavy is 230 feet tall and consists of three Falcon 9 first-stage cores. Thrust from its 27 engines is equivalent to 18 Boeing 747s, making it two times more powerful than any other rocket operating today, according to SpaceX.Before awarding the latest contract to SpaceX for the classified satellite, the Air Force had already planned to use the Falcon Heavy in its Space Test Program-2 mission, which is comprised of military and scientific research satellites. That mission is scheduled for sometime this year.The Falcon Heavy has also secured commercial missions and so far has contracts to stage satellite launch missions for ViaSat, Inmarsat and Arabsat.Famously, the payload for its first launch back in February was Elon Musk's Tesla Roadster.

Analysts and military officials believe that Lockheed's F-22 and F-35 as well as Northrop Grumman's B-2 bomber could be the only aircraft effective against the S-400 due to their stealth capabilities.Back in May, Russia tested a new surface-to-air missile that it claims could destroy even these stealth aircraft. The new S-500 is also supposedly able to intercept hypersonic missiles, drones and other aircraft. It also is said to be capable of destroying objects in near-space, some 62 miles above the face of the Earth.If Russia's claims are accurate, the S-500 would offset a major advantage in U.S. warfighting capacity.The F-35 program, the most expensive military program ever at $400 billion, has faced criticism over cost overruns and combat effectiveness.The stealth fighter only recently flew its first-ever combat missions as part of an Israeli air force operation.

8,NOC,"President Donald Trump's push to establish a sixth military branch dedicated to space would probably be a lot more expensive than just extending the U.S. Air Force's capabilities -- and no doubt the nation's largest defense contractors love that idea.XBoeing (BA), Lockheed Martin (LMT), Northrop Grumman (NOC) and Raytheon (RTN) stand to gain more business from a new space force branch, said George Ferguson, a senior defense analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence.Spending would probably include ""communication/GPS/surveillance satellites and the ability to protect ours, degrade others, launch and build satellites,"" Ferguson wrote in an email.But those companies shouldn't get too excited yet.

Northrop Grumman (NOC) is building a new stealth bomber amid criticism that costs aren't transparent enough, while Boeing looks to keep a foothold in combat aircraft.Bookmark this page to stay on top of the latest defense and aerospace sector news.View More Defense And Aerospace NewsGet instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.RELATED:Best Stocks To Buy And WatchDow Jones Industrial Average Index And Component Stock News

The system is also said to be capable of destroying objects flying at near-space ranges, 62 miles above the face of the Earth.If Russia's claims are accurate, the S-500 would offset a major advantage in U.S. warfighting capacity.The F-35 program, which is the most expensive military acquisition program in the world at $400 billion, has faced criticism over cost overruns and combat effectiveness.The stealth fighter has only just flown its first-ever combat missions as part of an Israeli air force operation, while the F-22 saw its first combat action in 2014 when the U.S. began its air campaign against ISIS.Lockheed was up 0.2% at 326.15 on the stock market today. United Technologies (UTX), whose Pratt & Whitney division makes the F-35's engines, was down 0.2%.

Last year however, Defense Secretary James Mattis defended the program.Critics have argued that the F-35 is unable to beat an F-16 in a dogfight due to a lack of maneuverability, with analysts musing that the focus on stealth capabilities may be the cause.And a trade-off of stealth fighters is that maintaining a low-observable radar profile means they cannot carry as many missiles and bombs under their wings. As a result, fourth-generation fighters such as the F-16, F-15 and F/A-18 can bring more firepower, and there are ways to reduce their detectability too.However an Israeli F-16 was shot down over Syria earlier this year.

Then last month, the F-35 went through more pre-IOT&E tests at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., to evaluate close air support and combat search and rescue capabilities.Actual IOT&E, which includes rigorous combat testing, is scheduled to start in September (more than a year behind schedule) and finish by May 2019. That event will also test the F-35's 3F software package, which provides 100% of the coding needed for full warfighting capability.It will also pit the F-35 against the venerable A-10 in a close air support matchup that Congress mandated amid a fierce debate over the A-10's future.The F-35 is supposed to fill the close air support role left by the A-10, but critics say the stealthy fighter doesn't have the same amount of firepower or survivability in combat and instead called on the Air Force to put off the planned retirement of the so-called Warthog.Lockheed has a lot riding on the tests.The F-35 program is key to Lockheed's growth as it accounts for about 25% of total revenue. The company has been steadily boosting its production rate, but getting to full output would nearly double the pace.Lockheed delivered 66 F-35s last year, and sees production and delivery of 91 jets this year.

Privacy Policy & Terms of UseTrump previewed plans for a new approach toward weapons sales during an appearance in Florida with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Wednesday.In the past, Trump said, ""it would be in some cases years before orders would take place because of bureaucracy with Department of Defense, State Department. We are short-circuiting that. It's now going to be a matter of days. If they're our allies we are going to help them get this important, great military equipment.""Trump has frequently used appearances with foreign leaders to pitch the benefits of U.S. weapons sales and his push to bolster defense spending by NATO allies is expected to aid American companies. Recent State Department approvals for weapons sales included $300 million of rockets and support equipment to Qatar and $2.9 billion in weapons, including F-16 jets, to Slovakia.The president's promise of approval for weapons exports in ""days"" is unlikely.Sales, even to close allies, will continue to be reviewed under criteria including whether they support national security interests, how they affect the military balance in the country's region and whether they might have an adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness.The policy announced Thursday wouldn't truncate the elaborate back-and-forth between a prospective foreign customer and the State Department and military services to determine a country's requirements, supply pricing and availability information and sign a formal ""letter of offer and acceptance"" before the package goes to Congress.Under long-standing practice, Congress has the key role in determining whether a proposed arms sale gets final approval.The State Department typically submits proposed sales for an informal notification period of about three weeks that's followed by a formal, publicly released document that Congress has as long as 30 days to approve. This formal congressional notification and review period for NATO allies is 15 days.Kaidanow said the salesmanship challenge includes recognizing ""that because the quality of our product is so high, sometimes, for example, it is more expensive than others."" She said the review would include ""financial advocacy"" that would help other countries buy U.S. products.Administration officials insisted human rights -- including the risk of civilian casualties -- will remain a consideration in arms sales. But they repeated a mantra that ""economic security is national security.""""When we enable our allies and partners to more easily obtain appropriate American defense articles and services, we improve our national security,"" Navarro said.

54,NOC,"Lockheed Martin (LMT) is gunning for a massive bulk order of F-35s to slash production costs, while Pentagon leaders weigh the expense of modernizing the stealth fighters that have already been produced.X The convergence of efforts is a product of the F-35's $400 billion acquisition strategy, which is to simultaneously produce jets and continue their development.Pentagon officials and Lockheed have for years pushed for a so-called block buy of F-35s, and a plan is going to be officially unveiled later this month. The purchase would include hundreds of the jets in a single multibillion dollar contract in the early 2020s to enable economies of scale. But such a deal would also involve more upfront costs.""Ultimately we all share the same enemy: cost. Our focus remains on achieving an $80 million airplane by 2020 and (we) believe the biggest levers to reduce cost beyond that are the use of economic order quantities, cost reduction initiatives, and a multiyear contract,"" Lockheed VP Jeff Babione, the firm's F-35 program leader, told the Wall Street Journal.However, it may face challenges as senior Pentagon officials have been frustrated by efforts to cut the cost of buying and flying the advanced combat planes over the past three years. This is despite Lockheed already trimming the average price of the F-35A to $95 million, from $122 million five years ago, with an aim to cut it further to $80 million by the end of the decade.Defense leaders are demanding more cuts, as annual production is already set to climb from 66 last year to around 150 jets in the early 2020s.Lockheed Martin stock finished 0.1% lower at 341.78 on the stock market today. Northrop Grumman (NOC), a major F-35 subcontractor, also dipped 0.1%, while United Technologies (UTX), which is building the engines for the F-35, edged up 0.3%.The tab is also coming due to modernize the more than 270 jets currently flying, and it could hit $16 billion.Citing the information provided by the Pentagon, Rep. Niki Tsongas said at a recent House Armed Services Committee hearing that costs will be split between $10.8 billion for software development and $5.4 billion for deploying the updates and other procurement expenses in support of the modernization efforts, according to Reuters.F-35 Joint Program Office head Vice Admiral Mathias Winter said the figure is the outer limit of the modernization costs however, and said the updates will enhance the jets' capabilities, bringing them to their maximum potential.""Continuous enhancements and improvements will be made to increase capabilities that make the F-35 more lethal and survivable,"" Winter told lawmakers.Meanwhile, the F-35's costs were an issue in Italy's recent election, and the Five Star party, which has vowed to scrap the country's participation in the F-35 program, is edging closer to to power.Italy is due to purchase 60 F-35As and 30 F-35Bs, at a cost of $14 billion, and has already taken delivery of nine F-35As from its own final assembly line at Cameri in northern Italy, according to Defense News.The Pentagon's other top combat aircraft program, the B-21 Raider bomber, is said to be on track despite production problems with the the engines and wings, including an air flow issue.House Armed Services Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee chair Rob Wittman, R-Va., hailed the work of prime contractor Northrop Grumman, particularly for how it has integrated its subcontractors together to solve the early design problems.""This is an extraordinary, complex aircraft. The issue is not that you have these uncertainties. The issue is how you address them,"" Wittman told Defense News at the McAleese/Credit Suisse defense conference.The B-21 is the most secretive program currently being undertaken by the U.S.The Air Force plans buy at least 100 of the aircraft for around $550 million each, with the total acquisition price tag estimated at up to $80 billion. They will replacing aging Cold War-era Boeing (BA) B-52s.United Tech's Pratt & Whitney unit is developing the engine for the aircraft. It is rumored to be a twin-engine, rather than a quad-engine, plane. Wittman said pushing enough air through the engines has proven to be a problem.""This is a very, very different design as far as airflow, and there have been some design challenges there,"" he said. ""It's not just the engine, but it's the ducting on the engine, too. I think all those things are elements that you would normally expect in an aircraft that's new, that takes a concept from B-2, refines and uses it on this platform.""YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Lockheed's F-35 Chief To Lead Skunk Works As Air Force Speeds 6th-Gen FighterDefense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsWhich Companies Are Now Outperforming 95% Of All Stocks?

56,NOC,"The American public's first sign that space warfare is being waged won't be giant explosions lighting up the sky or X-Wing fighters crashing to the ground. Instead, everyday conveniences that we take for granted would be disrupted, such as ATMs and streaming videos.X But the world's most powerful military could be crippled if an enemy destroyed or disabled critical space infrastructure as part of a space war. Navigation, guided missiles and missile-warning alerts rely on GPS satellites. Critical intelligence comes from spy satellites. Drones, Navy ships and infantry grunts use communications satellites. And the disruption of your mundane comforts, which increasingly rely on satellite communications, eventually could grind daily life to a halt.""Our entire global economy and our way of life (are) enabled by space capabilities,"" said Col. Shawn Fairhurst, deputy director at Air Force Space Command.Despite the success of American companies like SpaceX in the new space race, the U.S. is more vulnerable than ever to war in space. Russia and China are ramping up their offensive potential. And while the effects of space warfare on worldwide commerce would hurt the U.S. and its adversaries alike, the U.S. military's unmatched global footprint and forward-deployed posture mean it is especially dependent on space-based assets.IBD'S TAKE: A new Space Age is dawning as billionaires like Elon Musk and Amazon's Jeff Bezos look to explore deeper into the final frontier and make space exploration and commercial development more affordable.  So what was once a key enabler of U.S. dominance – famously on display during the first Gulf War when precision weapons and space-based imaging left the world awe-struck – is becoming a channel that adversaries can exploit to gain the upper hand.Russia and China ""are building those capabilities to challenge the United States of America, to challenge our allies and to change the balance of power in the world,"" Gen. John Hyten, the head of U.S. Strategic Command, said at the Reagan National Defense Forum in December. ""We cannot allow that to happen.""On Feb. 21, Susan Gordon, the principal deputy director of national intelligence, warned that China and Russia have laser weapons designed to damage space-based sensors. Two days later, Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David Goldfein predicted that it will only be ""a matter of years"" before space warfare is waged.Sign Up For Free IBD Newsletters: Market Prep | Tech ReportAmid the growing alarm about a war in space, the Pentagon plans to pour more money into space capabilities. Companies like Boeing (BA), Northrop Grumman (NOC), Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Raytheon (RTN) — which make rockets, satellites and other space assets — are poised to receive those dollars.Space was once seen as a sanctuary from military activity, even as it served as a stage for Cold War bragging rights. The Outer Space Treaty, enacted in 1967, outlaws the use of nuclear weapons in space and prohibits testing weapons or building military bases on the moon or other celestial bodies. Since then, satellites have enveloped the planet, while the International Space Station has been maintained as a sign of global scientific cooperation.But China and Russia have made no secret of their space warfare ambitions and could have anti-satellite weapons ready for combat in the next few years, according to the latest threat assessment report from the U.S. intelligence community, released Feb. 13.The threat has been growing for years. In 2007, China shocked the world when it fired a ground-based missile to destroy an old weather satellite in what was widely seen as a test of an anti-satellite system.Last month's U.S. intelligence report said China has been training with such ground-based anti-satellite missiles, and Russia is developing similar technology.Blowing up a satellite carries risks for the attacker, as it would create a massive debris field of perhaps 10,000 pieces and could put its own satellites in jeopardy too.But the intelligence report noted less blunt methods, such as Russia's ""experiment satellites"" now in orbit. These satellites have official missions like inspection, refueling and repair, but could be turned into weapons that stop short of destroying their targets.China has a satellite with an extendable robotic arm that it says can be used to collect space junk but likely can also be used to cripple working satellites. And Russia reportedly has highly maneuverable satellites secretly launched into orbit in 2015 that can be used to bump into other satellites.The U.S. isn't helpless. It has potentially dual-use technology that could be given offensive missions too. Satellites that can dock with existing satellites to refuel them could be turned into weapons by ordering them to bump enemy satellites out of orbit or equipping them with jammers or lasers, says Theresa Hitchens, senior research associate at the University of Maryland's Center for International and Security Studies. China has been working on similar technology.Northrop also provides anti-jamming capabilities but warns that ""only a very small amount of defense satellite communications are secure and protected against intercept and jamming threats."" The company declined to provide additional information about its anti-jamming and other defense capabilities for military or commercial satellites.Besides active defenses, the U.S. can make individual satellites less appealing as targets during a war in space.One way would be building large satellites used by many nations, so any attack would be seen as aggression against a potential coalition. Another way would be to develop more maneuverable satellites that could avoid collisions from other satellites, missiles or space debris.The military is also looking at deploying greater quantities of smaller satellites that spread out capabilities, instead of the current model of building large satellites that make ""juicy targets,"" according to Hyten.The U.S. can employ ground-based jammers, but they are only effective when the targeted satellite is in range. Lasers could also be used to temporarily blind or permanently disable a satellite, but the technology isn't mature enough yet to be effective against a large satellite.The bottom line is that the U.S. has much more to lose in space combat than its adversaries do.""We don't have good options for fighting back because this is an asymmetrical situation,"" as potential adversaries aren't as reliant on space systems, Hitchens said. ""It's not a tit-for-tat thing like it is for nuclear weapons.""Policymakers are aware of the threat and are working to address it. The National Defense Strategy released in January emphasized the need to ""prioritize investments in resilience, reconstitution, and operations to assure our space capabilities"" as ""attacks against our critical defense, government, and economic infrastructure must be anticipated.""In its fiscal 2019 budget request, the Air Force is seeking an 8% increase in space funding, the second straight year of significant increases to the space portfolio. The budget focuses on building more jam-resistant GPS satellites, while improving systems for missile warnings and situational awareness in space.Perhaps just as important as more funding and hardware is figuring out what kind of response an attack would merit. With no established norms of space warfare, it may be difficult to prevent an attack from spiraling out of control.For example, China could use an anti-satellite missile as a warning shot to tell the U.S. to back down and de-escalate a situation, Hitchens says. But the result could be the exact opposite. The U.S. could see the move as a sign of aggression and attack the missile's launch site, escalating the situation into an attack on the Chinese homeland.Another wrinkle is the fast-growing commercial space industry, with SpaceX showing it can deliver large military and spy satellites via its new Falcon Heavy rocket. SpaceX, Boeing and OneWeb are among the numerous companies with plans to launch thousands of satellites into low Earth orbit in the coming years.The new constellations about to enter space would provide space-based internet services as well as surveillance and tracking. Such capabilities are useful to companies that want to keep tabs on shipping fleets, but in theory they could help the military too.""If a commercial system is being deliberately used to provide the military with capabilities, in the time of war it's a legitimate target,"" Hitchens said.So what happens if China and Russia use their space assets on a commercial satellite? Is that an act of war?""That is a policy issue that is being actively discussed,"" said Stephen Flanagan, a senior political analyst at Rand Corp.While outer space is itself a vacuum, any fight there won't happen in a vacuum.Fairhurst says a war won't likely start in space. Instead, wars that start on the ground or at sea would extend into space.So options range from economic sanctions to a proportional response in a different domain, like an air- or ground-based attack.""We aren't locked into an answer,"" Fairhurst said. ""But the bottom line is that as a nation we have a right to defend ourselves if attacked. And just because we are attacked in space doesn't mean we have to respond in space.""YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Boeing And Apple Could Build A Parallel Internet In SpaceSpace Industry News And Top Aerospace StocksDefense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsIn This Space Race, Here's Where SpaceX May Not Come In First

On Tuesday, Intel closed up 0.7% at 51.45 after hitting 53.64 intraday, nearly retaking a 53.88 flat-base entry.Nvidia was indicated slightly lower after initially showing a modest gain.Remember that after-hours action in stock futures as well as individual stocks and ETFs doesn't always translate into regular-session gains.Chip stocks are a huge share of the market, especially in the Nasdaq. Chips are in so many products, from PCs, servers and smartphones like the Apple iPhone, to also ""non-tech"" products such as cars and appliances. So if semis are faring poorly, it's not a good sign for end demand in many industries. That's a big reason why last week's weak outlooks from contract chip giant Taiwan Semi and equipment makers Lam Research (LRCX) and ASML (ASML) have hurt the broader stock market.  Apple lost 1.4% on Tuesday after undercutting its 200-day line Monday.

62,NOC,"The S&P 500 index, Dow Jones industrial average and Nasdaq tumbled during the week as Alphabet (GOOGL), Caterpillar (CAT) and 3M (MMM) earnings and a 3% Treasury yield spooked investors. The stock market averages pared losses amid strong earnings from Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (FB), Boeing (BA), Visa (V) and others.The S&P 500 index, Dow Jones and Nasdaq found support near their 200-day moving averages, rebounding to close the week with fractional losses. The 10-year Treasury hit 3% for the first time in four years, hitting 3.02% during the week before pulling back to 2.96%. Short-term yields continued to rise faster than long-term rates, squeezing the yield spread. Alphabet (GOOGL) expenses and ongoing chip weakness also hit stocks. But Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (FB), Boeing (BA) and Visa (V) rallied on strong results. Intel (INTC) and Microsoft (MSFT) initially hit buy points Friday, but pulled back.Amazon's first-quarter earnings skyrocketed, more doubling the EPS estimate.

Fellow Dow Jones stock United Technologies (UTX) reported stronger-than-expected Q1 earnings and sales. The industrial giant also raised its full-year adjusted EPS and sales forecast.Lockheed Martin (LMT) topped first-quarter estimates and the defense contractor raised EPS and revenue targets. But the F-35 maker didn't raise its cash-flow expectation. Northrop Grumman (NOC) also reported Q1 earnings above estimates, but Northrop said it didn't submit a bid for the Air Force's GPS III contract, leaving Lockheed as the likely lone bidder. Raytheon (RTN) raised its full-year earnings forecast above consensus as its Q1 earnings and revenue topped estimates. General Dynamics (GD) beat on earnings and met revenue views. Shares of all four defense contractors sold off sharply for the week.The software kingpin earned 95 cents a share, up 36% year over year, on sales of $26.8 billion, up 16%, in its fiscal third quarter. Analysts expected 85 cents and $25.71 billion. Microsoft (MSFT) has been shifting its business from desktop PC software to cloud-computing infrastructure and applications, such as Office 365 and Azure. Microsoft's commercial cloud revenue rose 58% in fiscal Q3. The software giant initially reclaimed a recent buy point on Friday, but pared gains.Intel (INTC) earnings rose 32% as sales grew 9% to $16.1 billion, both well above analyst views. The chip giant guided higher for current quarter sales, indicating a third-straight quarter of top-line growth. Shares initially jumped to a 17-year high Friday but reversed to close slightly lower. Texas Instruments (TXN), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), STMicroelectronics (STM) and Xilinx (XLNX) got boosts from upbeat earnings reports. But chip-gear maker Teradyne (TER) tumbled after warning of weak demand for equipment to test mobile devices. Western Digital (WDC), which makes disk drives and memory chips, tumbled Friday despite beating fiscal Q3 views. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index fought for support at its 200-day moving average.Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) reported Q1 earnings and revenue that topped views but a sharp rise in capital spending, margin pressure and higher traffic acquisition costs sparked a sell-off in the internet search giant. Capex jumped to $7.3 billion from $2.5 billion in the year-ago period, including $2.4 billion for a real estate purchase in Manhattan. Traffic costs — or what Google pays partner websites to generate advertising revenue — jumped 36% to $6.288 billion. Google has hiked spending on YouTube and video content, cloud computing, smart home consumer appliances and artificial intelligence projects.PayPal (PYPL) topped earnings and revenue expectations as total payment volume rose 27% to $132 billion year over year, vs. estimates of $128 billion.

U.S. crude oil futures briefly topped $69 a barrel, the highest level since late 2014, but traded little changed for the week.General Motors (GM), Ford Motor (F) and Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) beat quarterly estimates. Ford will not invest in traditional sedans for North America going forward, and will almost phase out passenger cars by 2020, as consumers migrate to SUVs and light trucks. GM still sees small cars as an opportunity at home and abroad, even as it too shifts focus to larger and more profitable vehicles.Casino operator Las Vegas Sands (LVS) topped first-quarter results estimates, helped by strong demand in global gaming hub Macau and in Singapore. Macau also helped Q1 results for Wynn Resorts (WYNN), but its overall and Macau sales disappointed some analysts. Wynn Resorts also approved a dividend increase. The earnings report from Wynn was the first since Steve Wynn resigned as CEO and sold his stake following allegations of sexual misconduct. MGM Resorts (MGM) narrowly beat, but the stock tumbled on declining traffic at its U.S. locations. MGM is more U.S.-focused than Sands or Wynn.Amgen (AMGN) and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) broadly topped Q1 views, though Amgen's sales and adjusted profit outlook for 2018 were a bit soft at the midpoints. Sales of Alexion's blockbuster Soliris missed some estimates, but shares popped on a promising study for new drug ALXN1210. Biogen (BIIB) sales lagged on sluggish Spinraza and multiple sclerosis drug revenue. Prothena (PRTA) tanked 69% on Monday after it scrapped a rare disease drug on a failed Phase 2 study.

Total student enrollments rose 7.7% year over year to about 861,400. IBD 50 stock TAL Education's (TAL) EPS jumped to 14 cents a share as revenue soared 59% to $504 million.

Homebuilder stocks were generally muted due to rising interest rates. But D.R. Horton (DHI), the biggest U.S. builder, on Thursday bested views with a 52% EPS surge as revenue swelled 17% to $3.795 billion. Homebuilder stocks rallied for solid gains, helped by cooling Treasury yields. New-home sales rose in March to an annualized sales pace of 694,000 units, a four-month high. Meanwhile existing-home prices rose 6.8% in February vs. a year earlier.China search-engine leader Baidu (BIDU) reported a Q1 profit that blew past estimates, lifting shares. Baidu still owns a majority of iQiyi (IQ), which held its IPO in March. Video streaming website iQiyi accounts for roughly 20% of the parent's revenue. Shares in iQiyi fell after it released earnings in tandem with Baidu.Visa (V) reported a 29% EPS gain on a 13% revenue rise, both beating fiscal Q2 views. The credit- and debit-card giant raised its full-year revenue outlook. Shares leapt 4.8% on Thursday.3M (MMM) met EPS views as revenue rose 8% to $8.278 billion, just above consensus. But the Dow Jones giant slashed its full-year EPS target. 3M stock plunged.Caterpillar (CAT) reported strong Q1 earnings and sales, but shares of the heavy construction and equipment maker reversed sharply lower Tuesday after warning that operating margins hit a ""high watermark"" for the year.ServiceNow (NOW) reported Q1 profit and revenue above estimates. Fifty-two customers now spend over $5 million annually, a metric that is up 108% year over year.Edwards Lifesciences (EW) topped sales and adjusted profit views, but shares tanked as sales of transcatheter heart valve replacements lagged.Illumina (ILMN) beat the consensus. Adjusted profit rose 127% per share as sales swelled 31% to $782 million.Align Technology (ALGN) reported adjusted earnings of $1.17 per share and $436.9 million in revenue, handily beating views for 98 cents and $408 million, respectively.TD Ameritrade (AMTD) delivered impressive Q1 EPS and revenue growth, but fell short of some lofty expectations.

E-Trade Financial (ETFC) continues to rise after last week's strong results.First Solar (FSLR) hit a six-year high after Q1 earnings topped expectations due to the sale of several solar projects, as it expanded U.S. production.Proofpoint (PFPT), a cybersecurity firm, topped adjusted first-quarter earnings and revenue views, but guided low on Q2 profit. Shares fell 5.2% Friday. In Q1, advanced protection solutions nearly doubled to make up 20% of new and add-on bookings, up from 15% in the prior quarter.

But Amazon's Echo devices remain the connected-home market leader, with estimated 70% share. Amazon said it has created a new division called Alexa Voice Services. Kohler strutted out a smart mirror that uses Alexa and plays music. Reports resurfaced at CES that Amazon could begin testing ads on Alexa.Autonomous vehicles also were in the CES spotlight. Chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) announced a pact with ride-hailing service Uber, as well as expanding ties with Volkswagen (VLKAY) and Baidu (BIDU). Nvidia, citing customer feedback, said self-driving cars will begin to be deployed on a wide scale in 2020. Uber rival Lyft also was active, disclosing partnerships. Intel said that two million vehicles from BMW, Nissan (NSANY), and VW will leverage Mobileye technology to build high-definition maps for autonomous vehicles. Intel bought Mobileye last year for about $15 billion.Intel (INTC) CEO Brian Krzanich in a CES keynote speech addressed the chip security flaw that rattled investors in early January. Krzanich framed the chip problem as an industrywide issue and said progress has been made in patching the vulnerabilities.  Meanwhile, Microsoft reported a setback in its efforts to fix the security issues. It suspended issuing patches to guard against the threats after users of PCs with Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) chips complained that the software updates froze their computers.Banking giants JPMorgan Chase, PNC Financial Services (PNC) and Wells Fargo (WFC) topped fourth-quarter earnings views, though Wells' revenue was below estimates. JPMorgan reported a big drop in trading revenue, including a huge loss on a single equity trade for a client. Asset management giant BlackRock (BLK) earnings rose 21%, topping views, as assets topped $6 trillion.Target (TGT), Nordstrom (JWN) and Kohl's (KSS) reported strong November-December holiday sales, following Macy's (M) and J.C. Penney (JCP) in the prior week. Shares of Target, Kohl's and J.C. Penney enjoyed double-digit weekly gains while Macy's leapt nearly 10%.

Readings over 50 are positive. Among the subindexes, Americans' views of their personal financial outlook hit a 14-year high amid tax cuts and loftier stock prices. Yet views of government policies soured, as disaffection from Democrats and independents swamped Republicans' giddiness.Lennar (LEN) reported a surprise earnings decline, but only due to a shift in the timing of a transaction to take advantage of tax cuts in 2018. Revenue rose 12%, double expectations, amid a strong economy, tight supply and a fast recovery from recent hurricanes. Lennar, which is set to become the nation's largest homebuilder when its CalAtlantic acquisition closes next month, said its order backlog rose 23% to $3.6 billion.

The networking and cloud solutions provider has been under pressure from hedge fund Elliott Management, which owns a 6.5%, to maximize shareholder value. Shares spiked on the news, but then turned lower. Some of Akamai's biggest customers, including Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN), are bypassing the company with a DIY route.

66,NOC,"Apple (AAPL) and Bank Of America (BAC) top the latest list of new buys by top-performing mutual funds, but these large investors also placed big bets on stocks in the medical, semiconductor, building, chemical and machinery sectors.X Fund managers tend to take a longer-term approach, so their investments over the last three months in stocks like managed care provider Aetna (AET), chip equipment stock Applied Materials (AMAT), homebuilder Pulte Group (PHM) and industrial machinery maker Illinois Tool Works (ITW) show they expect continued growth this year in the key industries and sectors that often drive GDP and the overall economy.And despite fears that Amazon (AMZN) is primed to rule the retail world, these leading mutual funds also established new positions or added to their existing ones in Home Depot (HD) and Best Buy (BBY).Apple saw the most new buyers and the most money invested, with 65 funds picking up an estimated nearly $1.8 billion of the iPhone maker's shares.Apple has been carving out a flat base as part of a second-stage base-on-base formation. The stock closed Tuesday's session 1% below the 176.34 buy point.BofA was the only other stock on the list to get more than a $1 billion investment, as 57 funds sunk $1.04 billion into the banking giant.The Charlotte, N.C.-based company's share price has nearly doubled since Donald Trump's election in 2016, and the stock is now 19% above the 25.45 buy point it cleared last September.Many names on the list, including Best Buy, Texas Instruments (TXN) and FedEx (FDX), have already broken out and are now extended beyond their buy ranges, but Apple is not the only stock on the list in or near a potential buy zone.Graco (GGG), which provides equipment to measure, control and dispense fluid and powder materials in the manufacturing processing and construction industries, cleared a 44.80 buy point on Dec. 15 and is now trading at the upper end of the buy zone.Defense contractor Heico (HEI) also broke out in good volume on Dec. 15, but then pulled back to its 93.10 buy point, where it found support. The maker of jet engine components and electronic systems closed Tuesday's near the very top of the buy range.Pulte is up over 40% from a breakout in June, but the Atlanta-based homebuilder has been trading in a very tight range in recent weeks and may offer an add-on buying opportunity at 34.70.Applied Materials is trying to form a new base, but note that it's late-stage and the semiconductor equipment maker's relative strength line is well below new high ground. The stock continues to tests support at its 50-day line.Although Bank Of America received the aforementioned $1 billion buy-in, it also topped the list of stocks being sold with 36 net sellers (93 funds selling minus 57 buying).No. 2 on the sell side was fellow financial titan JPMorgan Chase (JPM), which had 35 net sellers (91 funds selling minus 56 buying).Defense contractors Boeing (BA), Honeywell (HON) and Northrop Grumman (NOC), as well as Aetna and Southwest Airlines (LUV), were also among the 10 stocks with the most net sellers.RELATED:2018 Stock Market Outlook: What To Watch For In The New YearLooking For The Next Nvidia?

67,NOC,"Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 could be the first missile defense system to target intercontinental ballistic missiles in the key boost phase, according to a report from Aviation Week, as North Korea develops missiles that could reach deeper into U.S. territory.X Last week, Pyongyang launched an ICBM that went higher any other missile it's fired, with the apogee indicating an ability to hit the U.S. East Coast and the West Coast.But Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., said last month that it's possible for the F-35 to shoot down nuclear missiles from North Korea or Iran with its Raytheon (RTN) AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAMs) just seconds after takeoff.""It's like an act of God,"" Hunter said. ""You have F-35s, you have AMRAAMs, and you can shoot these things down as they go up.""Boeing's (BA) F-15 could also be used if it had the right sensors but the stealthy fifth-generation F-35 already has key sensors installed, Aviation Week noted.In particular, Northrop Grumman (NOC) has developed the F-35's infrared AN/AAQ-37 sensors that serve as an aircraft and missile warning system and the jet's fire control radar. The company has been testing the sensors on ballistic missiles for several years, according to the report.Tom Lawhead, head of the Air Force Joint Strike Fighter Integration Office, agrees with Hunter and told Aviation Week that the technology is feasible with the F-35. Northrop would need three years from starting integration to achieve full missile defense potential.Northrop has tested a ground-based system coupled with a radar-enabled aircraft in 2014 as a proof of concept, and Missile Defense Agency Deputy Director Rear Adm. Jon Hill told Avation Week that the F-35 along with lasers and drones are under consideration for the  Trump administration's Ballistic Missile Defense Review.Lockheed shares dipped 0.5% on the stock market today. Raytheon, Boeing and Northrop fell 0.9%.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.Boost-phase defense has been the goal of missile defense experts for decades, as existing systems are geared toward latter phases of a flight path.Raytheon's Patriot system is useful against conventional weapons and works by intercepting missiles in the low atmosphere in their final approach toward the target, or terminal phase.Lockheed's Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system is designed to shoot down short- and medium-range ballistic missiles in the terminal phase as well.But nuclear missiles will deliver multiple warheads and decoys making terminal defenses less effective.The Air Force has tested a laser that's mounted in a Boeing 747 — to shoot down missiles in their boost phase — but the program was canceled for being too expensive. Drones could do the same job, but analysts aren't sure the technology is mature enough.RELATED: Report Doubts Effectiveness Of Raytheon's Patriot In Recent AttackAs North Korea Threat Looms, Here's How U.S. Missile Defense WorksRaytheon Hits Buy Zone As Romania Buys Patriot; U.S. Arms Sales SurgeThese Defense Giants Poised To Gain From New Missile Defense MovesDefense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry News

69,NOC,"Romania is closer to a $3.9 billion deal for Raytheon's (RTN) Patriot missile-defense system amid a surge in demand for U.S. weapons overseas, helping the stock break out into buying territoryX The NATO partner signed a Letter of Offer and Acceptance for the Patriot Wednesday after announcing plans to buy it in April.The letter allows contract negotiations between Romania and the U.S. to begin. The State Department must notify Congress of all weapons sales to foreign partners, and Congress approves any final deal.The deal would include seven Patriot Configuration 3+ units,  56 Patriot MIM-104E Guidance Enhanced Missile-TBM missiles and 168 Patriot Advanced Capability-3 Missile Segment Enhancement missiles.The Patriot is useful against conventional weapons. It has a range of just 12 miles and works by intercepting missiles in the low atmosphere in their final approach toward the target, or terminal phase.Earlier this month the State Department approved the potential sale of four Patriot systems to Poland.Raytheon shares closed up 1.4% at 191.15 on the stock market today, clearing a 190.35 entry point. Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Boeing (BA), which also produce missile-defense systems, rose 0.1% and 2.8%, respectively. (Lockheed also makes interceptors for the Patriot system.) Northrop Grumman (NOC), whose acquisition of Orbital ATK (OA) will give it a greater presence in missile defense, added 0.2%.IBD'S TAKE: Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and other defense stocks are forming new bases and are poised for breakouts as tensions rise in the Middle East, Europe and in the Pacific.Heightened global tensions have increased the demand for U.S. arms abroad. The Defense Security Cooperation Agency said weapons sales in fiscal year 2017, which ended in September, rose nearly 25% to $41.93 billion.""This positive sales trend isn't surprising as the United States is the global provider of choice for Security Cooperation,"" Lt. Gen. Charles Hooper, DSCA director, said in a statement. ""We deliver not only the most effective defense systems to our partners, but we also ensure a 'Total Package' approach that includes the provision of training, maintenance, and sustainment, to support full spectrum capability for our partners.The Middle East has seen heavy dealmaking in recent years, particularly from Saudi Arabia. In May,  President Trump announced $110 billion in arms deals when he visited  the kingdom.Lockheed said in a release that Saudi Arabia wants to buy more than $28 billion in ""integrated air and missile defense, combat ship, tactical aircraft and rotary wing technologies and programs.""Boeing deals included a Chinook helicopter and support services, guided-weapons systems and the P-8 reconnaissance plane.RELATED:Missed Lockheed, Raytheon Buy Points?

The ETF is holding at the support line — a solid rebound off the 50-day moving average would mark a potential buy opportunity. Last time it bounced off the line in late June, shares advanced as much as 19% to an Oct. 23 intraday high.The $4.8 billion fund, which launched in May 2006, tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Select Aerospace & Defense Index. It's trended higher since the presidential election last year, when defense, bank and building-related stocks took off amid expectations for a Trump bump.ITA has been no slouch over the longer haul, either. Though it endured a 61% drop from 2007 to 2009, as the Great Recession took its toll on the market, it's headed mostly higher since.The fund has soared 28.6% this year through Nov. 10, according to Morningstar Direct, outperforming the S&P 500's 17.3% year-to-date gain. An average annual return of 18.5% and 24.3% for the past three and five years, respectively, are also ahead of the benchmark index's 10.5% and 15.8% gains.

72,NOC,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — Top Air Force officials sounded skeptical about an airborne command and surveillance aircraft, saying late Thursday that it would meet less than 1% of requirements from commanders.XThe Air Force opened the competition late last year on the Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS) recapitalization program to replace Northrop Grumman's (NOC) E-8. Boeing (BA), Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Northrop are leading teams with bids for the new aircraft.The service was supposed to make a decision last month on whether the $7 billion JSTARS program would go forward as planned. But the Air Force acknowledged in September that it's evaluating ""alternative approaches"" and sounded hesitant at a briefing Thursday afternoon.""JSTARS is battlefield management control. We are very serious about it. And because we are serious about it, we are evaluating how we do it,"" Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson said Thursday at the State of the Air Force presentation at the Pentagon.Wilson said the current system of one large plane with a radar system on its belly meets less than 5% of combatant commander's requirements. But the JSTARS replacement, also envisioned as a large plane, would meet less than 1% of requirements under current threats.The Boeing team is offering a modified version of its top selling 737-700 commercial jet, while Lockheed is working with a Bombardier Global 6000 business jet, and Northrop's offering is a modified Gulfstream G550 business jet.Top service officials have said an alternative approach to having a single aircraft would be to instead network various aircraft, drones and sensors as a temporary measure until a more survivable system is developed. Wilson echoed that stance at the briefing.The original E-8 ""was brought into service when I was on the national security staff in 1991, the start of the Persian Gulf War. Technology has changed since then,"" she said. ""Can we do this a different way by fusing that data (from multiple sensors) instead of relying on one aircraft? That's the question we are asking.""Northrop shares fell 0.3% on the stock market today. Lockheed rose a few cents, while Boeing lost 0.7%.IBD'S TAKE: By learning to use call options, investors can significantly reduce risk and capitalize on basing stocks that are making breakaway gains caused by earnings reports.The Pentagon has sounded shaky about the current recapitalization program for several months.At the Air Force Association conference in September, Defense Secretary James Mattis noted different ways of doing the JSTARS mission but didn't directly address the JSTARS program.""I just talked to chief of staff of the air force; we are standing here in front of the room talking about new ways to do the JSTARS mission,"" he said. ""I'm eager to hear these efforts to help one another, the other services.""RELATED: These Defense Giants Poised To Gain From New Missile Defense Moves

73,NOC,"A couple of top-performing defense and aerospace ETFs have strikingly similar charts, yet their portfolios are significantly different.X SPDR S&P Aerospace & Defense (XAR) and iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense (ITA) are both forming flat bases and are near buy points. SPDR Aerospace's chart shows a potential buy point at 83.05, while iShares Aerospace & Defense has a buy point at 184.70. It edged above that level Thursday but fell below it Friday in the general market sell-off.Both ETFs share the industry titans such as Boeing (BA), United Technologies (UTX), Lockheed Martin (LMT), Northrop Grumman (NOC) and Raytheon (RTN). The two funds have about 35 stocks each, but the portfolios are structured differently.SPDR S&P Aerospace & Defense is an equal-weighted index in which small caps such as aircraft components maker Triumph Group (TGI) and rocket builder Orbital ATK (OA) have as much weighting as Northrop and Boeing, with market capitalization of $53 billion and $160 billion, respectively.IBD's TAKE: Making money catching ETF uptrends requires knowledge about how to read charts. You can learn how at IBD University.By comparison, iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF uses the Dow Jones U.S. Select Aerospace and Defense Index, in which Boeing has 10.5% of the weighting and Triumph Group only about 1%. The eight smallest components account for less than 1% each.Regardless of structure, the two ETFs have performed in a remarkably similar manner. Both have five-year average annual gains of about 24%, three-year average gains of about 18% (through Oct. 31) and year-to-date gains of around 30%.Most of the major defense stocks have performed quite well in 2017, and are trading near all-time highs.Defense stocks usually perform well even in times of peace, because defense spending rarely drops. This year, operations in Syria and Iraq against ISIS are winding down, but North Korea's fast-moving missile program poses new security threats for the U.S. and its allies. U.S. forces remain in battle against the Taliban in Afghanistan.Lockheed builds the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system, which can shoot down short- and medium-range ballistic missiles. Raytheon builds the Patriot missile defense system. President Trump is seeking an additional $4 billion for missile defense programs amid rising tensions with North Korea.Commercial aviation is another major factor in these ETFs, and that business continues to roll on rising orders for more-efficient jetliners, a trend reinforced in this month's Dubai air show.""The order strength, and positive headlines against more modest expectations, at the Dubai airshow provide additional evidence of the strength in the commercial (plane) cycle,"" Canaccord Genuity analysts Ken Herbert and Jamaine Aggrey wrote in a report. ""We continue to see incremental risk on the wide-body outlook, but improving traffic and profitability with Middle East airlines"" in particular are positives.The IBD ETF Leaders index shows the performance of a model portfolio of exchange traded funds that are leading the overall market.

74,NOC,"Lockheed Martin (LMT), Raytheon (RTN) and other defense stocks are forming new bases and are poised for breakouts as North Korea ramps up its nuclear missile tests.X Lockheed shares rose 0.5% to 320.66 on the stock market today, consolidating in a flat base with a 322.29 buy point.Lockheed builds the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system, designed to shoot down short- and medium-range ballistic missiles in the terminal phase. The THAAD system is currently deployed in South Korea, Guam and Alaska.Earlier this month, President Trump requested an additional $4 billion for missile defense programs as tensions  heat up with North Korea.On Tuesday, North Korea successfully tested what experts believe is an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of putting the entire U.S. mainland at risk of an attack.IBD'S TAKE: As an investor, you may wonder why buy points are important. The chart action of these top stocks offers an answer.Raytheon shares closed down 0.1% to 189.59, but near a 190.35 entry point.Raytheon builds the Patriot missile defense system, which is useful against conventional weapons. It has a range of just 12 miles and works by intercepting missiles in the low atmosphere in their final approach toward the target, or terminal phase.General Dynamics (GD) shares fell 2 cents to 204.17, consolidating in a flat base with a 214.91 buy point. General Dynamics is still below its 50-day moving average.  Textron (TXT) shares rose 1% to 54.84, also consolidating in a flat base with a 55.90 entry point.Boeing (BA) and Northrop Grumman (NOC) had some three-weeks-tight action but haven't yet formed a base with discernible buy points.Boeing, the Dow's top performer in 2017, rose 0.5%.

75,NOC,"The freight train that is the stock market kept on chugging ahead in October, with the S&P 500 tacking on a 2.33% gain to make it 12 straight months of growth, according to Lipper Inc. U.S. diversified stock mutual funds jumped on board, advancing 1.70% on average, the 14th monthly gain in the past 15 months.XThe broad market got a lift from such leading stocks and Dow Jones Industrial stocks as Caterpillar (CAT), Apple (AAPL), UnitedHealth Group (UNH), 3M (MMM) and Intel (INTC).The October gain by U.S. diversified stock funds was due largely to ongoing global economic growth, increased odds of corporate tax reform with a possible lowering of the corporate tax rate, and increased likelihood of the Federal Reserve raising its short-term interest rate in the near term, said Jonathan Edwards, a manager of Invesco Value Opportunities Fund (VVOAX). The $839 million fund's 1.64% gain in October topped 69% of its large-cap value rivals tracked by Morningstar Direct.In addition, for the most part corporate earnings have been OK, said Sameer Samana, global quantitative strategist for Wells Fargo Investment Institute. He added that a few individual companies logged disappointments, which helped mute investor sentiment. Sentiment was further dampened by infighting among Republican leadership. That reminded investors that corporate tax reform is not a sure thing, Samana said.With a 3.41% October gain, large-cap growth funds outpaced other U.S. diversified stock fund categories last month. Multi-cap growth funds averaged a 3.08% gain.Douglas Roman, manager of $92 million PNC Multi-Factor Large Cap Growth Fund (PEWAX), attributed outperformance by large-cap stock funds to strong economies in the U.S. and abroad. Large-cap companies are more likely to sell goods and services abroad as well as in the U.S. The PNC fund's 3.98% October gain outpaced 78% of its large-cap growth competitors.U.S. multinationals in particular got a tailwind from the relative weakness of the U.S. dollar vs. the euro, especially later in October, which helped U.S. exports, Roman said.Reflecting widespread global economic growth, world equity mutual funds rose 1.83% last month, topping the showing by U.S. diversified stock funds.India region funds led the way for foreign stock funds, jumping 5.89% last month.Global science and technology funds led the major sectors, rising 5.49% last month.General domestic taxable bond funds gained 0.29% on average in October. Loan participation funds' 0.56% return led all taxables in the month. Muni bond funds were about flat in October.The stock market got an additional lift from the hunt for a new chairperson of the Federal Reserve — who in November turned out to be current Fed Governor Jerome Powell. In October, investors appeared to welcome the prospect that the apparent leading contenders would keep the central bank on its current path of raising rates, said Charles Shriver, manager of T. Rowe Price's $2.3 billion Personal Strategy Balanced (TRPBX) and $295 million Global Allocation (RPGAX) funds. Balanced beat 87% of its allocation peer group in October. Global Allocation topped 62% of its direct rivals.Going forward, T. Rowe Price's Shriver likes foreign stocks in general more than U.S. equities. ""Fundamentals are positive, but valuations give us a little pause. We are underweight in areas whose valuations are a little more rich,"" he said.Among foreign stocks, ""Japan is an area where we see the cheapest valuations among developed markets.""IBD'S TAKE: Tokyo-based bank holding company Mitsubishi Ufj Financial Group was a top holding as of June 30 of $6.7 billion Matthews Asia Dividend Investor Fund (MAPIX), which is a diversified Pacific/Asia fund and an IBD 2017 Best Mutual Fund Awards winner. The stock edged up 4.4% last month. Earnings per share rose 20%, 44% and 55% the past three months after having declined for five stanzas in a row.On the other hand, lower U.S. corporate tax rates would benefit U.S. stocks, said Invesco's Edwards. ""That favors economically sensitive stocks as well as financials,"" he said.Holdings he likes for those reasons include LPL Financial (LPLA). ""They are one of the largest independent financial advisory firms,"" Edwards said. ""One hundred percent of their profits are from the U.S., so they would benefit from a lower corporate tax rate. And a significant part of their earnings are from interest on customers' cash balances. As interest rates go up, they would earn more on those balances.""He also cites SVB Financial Group (SIVB). ""They're a regional bank (mostly) in California, focused on the technology sector,"" he said. ""A lot of their loans are floating rate. As (the Fed raises) short-term rates, it would increase their net interest margin."" And the large portion of their profit that is based on U.S. revenue would benefit from a lower corporate tax rate.PNC's Roman is overweight in industrials, financials and consumer discretionary. He likes industrials because of the prospects for aerospace and defense firms. Financials should benefit from rate hikes. And he likes the diversity of consumer discretionary. ""From homebuilders to dollar stores, there's always some opportunities,"" he said.As of Sept. 30, among his top holdings were aerospace giant Boeing (BA) and defense contractors Northrop Grumman (NOC) and General Dynamics (GD).He likes auto parts, travel and home furnishings. Auto-parts maker Delphi Automotive (DLPH) was another holding. Smaller holdings included Wyndham Worldwide (WYN).RELATED:You Need This Much Retirement Income At Your Age And Income

76,NOC,"It will cost more than a trillion dollars to improve America's nuclear forces, according to a new estimate, but analysts argue that the Pentagon can get by with less.XThe Congressional Budget Office on Tuesday put the price tag at $1.2 trillion dollars through 2046, just 6% of total defense spending over 30 years but 20% higher than its estimate three years ago. The bill includes about $800 billion to make incremental upgrades to existing weapons near the end of their usable life spans, and about $400 billion for modernization efforts like the new Northrop Grumman (NOC) B-21 bomber.The total figure is actually $1.7 trillion with inflation included, noted Tom Collina, director of policy at the Ploughshares Fund, which is focused on reducing nuclear weapons.In addition to the B-21, the Pentagon has already award initial contracts to other defense giants like Boeing (BA), Lockheed Martin (LMT), Raytheon (RTN) and General Dynamics (GD) for everything from nuclear-armed missiles to nuclear-armed submarines.The massive cost estimate for the nuclear force comes as the Defense Department faces other big-ticket priorities such as Lockheed's F-35 and pushing the Navy's fleet back above 300 ships.But the bill doesn't have to be that high for taxpayers and the CBO offered suggestions on how to lower costs. Here are some:America's nuclear force has for decades been based on the triad of land-, air- and sea-based weapons. But getting rid of the land-based ICBM leg, would save $120 billion though 2046. Of that, roughly $90 billion would come from canceling a replacement program. In August, the Air Force awarded Boeing and Northrop preliminary design phase contracts for it.Former Defense Secretary William Perry and retired Gen. James Cartwright, former vice chair of the Joint Chiefs, wrote a letter to President Trump on behalf of the Ploughshares Fund, arguing that ICBMs create instability and increase the possibility of accidental nuclear war.""Our ICBMs are in danger of being launched in the case of another false alarm (we have experienced three to date), thereby starting a civilization-ending nuclear war by accident.""But during his confirmation hearing earlier this year, Defense Secretary James Mattis backed the development of new ICBMs.Perry and Cartwright support the building of ""an appropriate number of new, nuclear-armed submarines as the most survivable leg of the deterrent"" and new bombers that also have conventional applications.Going without the new  Long Range Standoff weapon would save $28 billion through 2046. Last month, the Air Force also awarded Lockheed and Raytheon preliminary design phase contracts for the LRSO.While CBO warned the lack of cruise missiles ""would diminish the capability of U.S. nuclear forces, particularly for limited nuclear strikes,"" Collina said the LRSO creates more instability as Russia can't tell if the air-launched missiles are nuclear or conventional and could spark a nuclear response to a conventional weapon.""Have conventional weapons  do the job instead,"" he suggested. ""We have conventional cruise missiles that can take out air defenses. We don't have to use nuclear missiles.""IBD'S TAKE: Ready to invest but don't know where to start? An easy to follow routine from IBD can help you grow and protect your money over the long term.The Defense Department is currently reassessing its nuclear strategy as part of its Nuclear Posture Review, which will be sent to the White House by the end of the year.Collina noted that the U.S. can still maintain plenty of bang for fewer bucks.""The core of our power are conventional forces that can be deployed and project power around the world,"" he said. ""We can still be a nuclear power and have way fewer nuclear weapons than we have today.""Boeing shares rose 0.2% to 258.50 on the stock market today, still in buy range. Lockheed fell 0.5%, just below buy zone, Raytheon edged up less than 0.1%, Northrop lost 0.45% and General Dynamics eased 0.7%.RELATED:Hypersonic Weapons: The Biggest Warfighting Disrupter Since Stealth Is ComingDefense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry News

77,NOC,"Raytheon (RTN) reported mixed third-quarter results Thursday and raised its full-year earnings outlook, though it remains weak.XEstimates: EPS rising 6.1% to $1.90 with revenue up 5% to $6.33 billion.Results: EPS climbed 7.1% to $1.97. Revenue rose 4.5% to $6.28 billion.Missile Systems unit sales jumped 10% to $1.9 billion on higher sales of its Paveway laser guided bombs and Excalibur guided artillery rounds. Sales at the Integrated Defense Systems division, which includes the Patriot missile defense system, rose 4% to $1.4 billion.Backlog at the end of the  quarter was $36.7 billion, up from $35.7 billion at the end of Q3 2016. Raytheon booked $145 million in order for the Tomahawk cruise missile and $102 million for the Standard Missile 3.""Global customer demand drove an increase in our backlog, which positions us well for continued growth in 2018,"" CEO Thomas Kennedy said in the earnings release.Outlook: Raytheon now sees 2017 EPS of $7.45-$7.55, up from its earlier outlook of $7.35-$7.50, and narrowed its full-year sales outlook to $25.3 billion-$25.6 billion, from a prior guidance of $25.1 billion-$25.6 billion. But the raised guidance is still below the consensus for EPS of $7.59 on sales of $25.57 billion.Stock: Shares fell 3.9% to 181.83  on the stock market today, undercutting their 50-day line in heavy volume.Raytheon has been a major beneficiary of the growing demand for missile defense systems. Raytheon also builds the Patriot, which was purchased by Romania over the summer. A big Patriot contract with Poland was also signed, while countries in the Middle East and Asia are lining up to buy or upgrade systems.Raytheon wraps up a busy week for defense earnings. Lockheed Martin (LMT) missed but raised its full year EPS Outlook. Northrop Grumman (NOC) also raised its full year outlook and announced it wouldn't bid on the Navy's MQ-25 unmanned tanker.

"
78,NOC,"Boeing's (BA) KC-46 Air Force refueling tanker continues to rack up more expenses, the aerospace giant revealed Wednesday, weighing on an otherwise positive third-quarter report.XThe commercial unit saw additional KC-46 costs of $256 million in Q3, and the defense unit booked another $73 million during the quarter. Under a fixed-cost contract with the Pentagon, Boeing is on the hook for any cost overruns, which now total $2.9 billion before taxes and $1.9 billion after taxes.The latest charges are due to changes to initial production aircraft as late testing continues, and not to ""new significant technical discoveries,"" said CEO Dennis Muilenberg on a conference call.He added that the tanker, which is based on a Boeing 767 airframe, has been performing well in flight tests, and described issues with the tanker's refueling boom as normal.The challenges that have been arising recently are related to getting the aircraft up to certification standards. And as the company puts the finishing touches on the tanker, it is concurrently producing them.""We still have some items to work though on how we do concurrency and how we do it efficiently,"" Muilenberg said.Early this year, Boeing CFO Greg Smith said the tanker had largely gotten past its development issues, leaving ""just factory work,"" though flight testing remained.Despite the KC-46's additional costs, management boosted Boeing's overall 2017 cash flow guidance to $12.5 billion from $12.25 billion, led by improved performance.The company also raised its full-year core EPS outlook to $9.90-$10.10 from a prior view of $9.80-$10.00, driven by a lower tax rate, though the midpoint is still below the consensus estimate of $10.06 and implied Q4 EPS is $2.62-$2.82, below views for $2.96.In Q3, core earnings per share dropped 22.5% to $2.72, but topped forecasts for $2.65, while revenue edged up 1.7% to $24.31 billion, above estimates for $24.06 billion, as Boeing said earlier commercial aircraft deliveries rose 7.4% to 202 during the quarter.Commercial aircraft revenue fell 1% to $14.98 billion. Defense, space and security revenue dropped 5% to $5.47 billion. Global services revenue grew 2% to $3.57 billion. Backlog slipped to $474 billion at the end of Q3 from $482 billion at the start of Q3.Shares sank 2.85% to 258.42 on the stock market today, putting Boeing back in the top of its buy range after breaking out from a 246.59 entry last month. European rival Airbus (EADSY) edged up 1.2%.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.Boeing's defense unit also faces the risk of losing a chance to sell F/A-18 E/F Super Hornets to Canada amid a trade dispute over Bombardier's C Series jet. But Muilenberg dismissed the political tension, saying the relationship with the U.K, and Canada will outlast this trade issue.The Commerce Department's 300% tariff on the C Series, which Boeing complained was receiving illegal state aid, was also seen as a factor in Airbus taking a majority stake in the C Series program, potentially expanding Airbus' offerings in the narrowbody market and putting pressure on Boeing to launch a mid-market plane.On Wednesday, Boeing said the Airbus-Bombardier deal hasn't affected its strategy and reiterated that it is still reviewing a decision on a new plane.RELATED: Northrop Raises Outlook After Surprise Q3 Earnings Gain; General Dynamics MixedDefense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsHypersonic Weapons: The Biggest Warfighting Disrupter Since Stealth Is Coming

"
80,NOC,"Northrop Grumman (NOC) said Wednesday that it would not submit a bid for the Navy's unmanned tanker competition, despite being seen as a major player in the contest.XWe ""made a decision not to bid MQ-25 based on the particular nature of that"" request for proposal, CEO Wes Bush said during the company's Q3 earnings call.The Navy released an official request for proposal for the MQ-25A earlier this month and now the competition is down to Lockheed Martin (LMT), Boeing (BA), and General Atomics. A final contact is expected next year. The Pentagon has earmarked $2.16 billion for the program through fiscal 2021, though the contract's total value would be larger.Northrop, whose Global Hawk helped earn the company prominence in drone technology, was expected to be a formidable bidder for the Navy drone, as its X-47B prototype had been used in Navy technology demonstrations, which even included takeoff and landing operations from an aircraft carrier.But the Navy has scaled back its drone program from its original inception as a strike and surveillance aircraft, with its mission now targeted for aerial refueling.Bush said the decision not to bid wasn't just about winning the contract but looking at the ability to meet all of the requirements. But ""broadly things are going really well"" for the company's unmanned systems, he said, adding that the MQ-4C Triton unmanned intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance drone is moving along.Northrop shares jumped 3.7% to close at a record high of 304.75 on the stock market today.Northrop's Q3 earnings rose 10% to $3.68 while sales rose 6% to $6.53 billion. Analysts were expecting EPS of $2.92 with revenue of $6.32 billion.Aerospace Systems unit sales rose 11% to $3.1 billion on higher F/A-18 Super Hornet and other manned aircraft sales, including a restricted manned aircraft, which is likely company's secretive B-21 bomber. Mission system sales rose 5% on higher sensor sales for the F-35.Northrop makes the F/A-18's aft/center fuselage section and vertical tails and is also a major subcontractor on Lockheed's F-35.Northrop raised its full-year EPS outlook to $12.90-$13.10 from a prior guidance of $12.10-$12.40. It now sees 2017 sales of $25.5 billion from a prior outlook of $25 billion. The new forecasts are bullish vs. consensus views for EPS of $12.91 on revenue of $12.59 billion.Management also said its acquisition of Orbital ATK (OA) for $9.2 billion will add to Northrop's earnings no later than first full year after the acquisition closes sometime in the first half of 2018.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? IBD's Leaderboard is showing a 60% increase over the S&P 500 so far this year.General Dynamics (GD) and Boeing also announced Q3 results Wednesday.General Dynamics saw a 7% increase in EPS to $2.52 but revenue dipped 1% to $7.58 billion.

81,NOC,"The Navy is pushing for a multiship order of aircraft carriers to help reduce costs, but a debate remains over the need for such large warships as adversaries develop sophisticated weapons that put them at greater risk.XNavy Secretary Richard Spencer told the Wall Street Journal that shipbuilders suggested buying two aircraft carriers at a time when he asked industry how the service could reduce costs.Huntington Ingalls (HII), which was spun off from Northrop Grumman (NOC) in 2011, is the only prime contractor for aircraft carriers.""If we can tighten up our government-supplied equipment and have a very efficient hull build, we are starting to get savings that are very meaningful,"" Spencer said, though he didn't say how much could be saved.But critics are increasingly questioning the need for carriers, now that adversaries have weapons that could reduce their effectiveness.For example, China's DF-21D and longer-range DF-26 anti-ship ballistic missiles have been dubbed ""carrier killers."" Russia's Oscar II-class submarines are designed to counter carriers.The emergence of such weapons comes amid spiraling costs for carriers, which can now cost up to $13 billion each and may have to operate farther away from battles, stretching the effective range of the aircraft they carry.But Spencer told the Journal that the Navy still views carriers as a key element and has the technology to protect them.Currently, Congress only approves the purchase of one carrier at a time, but the Pentagon is pushing for other bulk orders to save money.Top defense officials are seeking a 440-plane order of Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 in the hopes that such a ""block buy"" will save up to $2 billion.Shares of Huntington Ingalls were down 8 cents at 234.81 on the stock market today. Lockheed shares rose 0.4% to 316.89, still in buy range after breaking out of a flat base with a 308.58 entry point last month. Northrop rose 0.2%, above buy range. General Dynamics (GD), which also makes Navy warships, advanced 0.7% and is still in buying territory.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.The debate over the aircraft carrier's long-term effectiveness comes as President Trump wants to expand the Navy's fleet to 350 ships from 275 today.Last year, the Congressional Budget Office said the Navy could save $21 billion from 2018 through 2026 if it stopped building new aircraft carriers. The money could be used to buy less-expensive, smaller ships.RELATED: President Trump, Republicans Still Face Defense Spending ShowdownDefense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

82,NOC,"Lockheed Martin (LMT), Northrop Grumman (NOC), and Raytheon (RTN) are among top defense companies reporting earnings this week as increasing global tensions have helped lift their stocks.XAnalysts expect the F-35 maker's earnings to fall 10% to $3.25 per share but revenue is seen rising 11% to $12.83 billion.F-35 deliveries are skewed to the back-half of the year, giving Lockheed a likely boost in Q3. The company is expected to deliver 66 of the fighters this year, up from 46 in 2016.Missile defense sales should also be a hot topic on the company's conference call for the maker of the THAAD antimissile system.""The pace of inquiries, the depth of the inquiries and intensity are increasing month by month,"" Timothy Cahill, the VP of Integrated Air & Missile Defense told reporters at the annual Association of the United States Army conference earlier this month.Cahill said Lockheed is getting interest from countries, especially in Europe, that didn't have a high priority on missile defense in the past.The U.S. is also focused on increasing missile defense at home. The Defense Department has asked Congress to shift $416 million into missile defense programs like Lockheed's Aegis systems.Lockheed closed Friday at 320, still in buy range from a 308.58 buy point cleared in late September.Northrop Grumman is out Wednesday. Analysts see EPS dipping 3% to $2.92 with revenue up 2.6% to $6.3 billion.The company will likely give updates on its $9.2 billion buyout of Orbital ATK (OA) announced during the quarter.The deal gives helps Northrop expand its missile defense capabilities and catch up to rivals in the market, because Orbital builds the interceptor boosters for Boeing's (BA) Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system used by the U.S. Missile Defense Agency. It also builds target vehicles for tests.It could also help Northrop beat out Boeing to win the Air Force's Ground Based Strategic Deterrent contract to replace the aging Boeing Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile system.But Northorp will likely stay quiet about its secretive B-21 bomber. At an Air Force Association breakfast last week, Lt. Gen. Arnold Bunch, military deputy in Air Force acquisition, said the program is on track and ""marching to acquisitions timelines.""Boeing, General Dynamics (GD) and FLIR (FLIR) are also out Wednesday.Northrop and Boeing shares are just out of buying range, while FLIR is somewhat extended. But General Dynamics, at 213.86, is in a buy zone from a 206 entry.On Thursday, analysts see Raytheon reporting a 6% increase in EPS to $1.90 and a 5% boost in revenue to $6.33 billion.The company has been a big beneficiary of the growing demand for missile defense systems. Raytheon also builds the Patriot, which was purchased by Romania over the summer. A big Patriot contract with Poland has also been signed, while countries in the Middle East and Asia are lining up to buy or upgrade systems.Raytheon is well extended from a May breakout.RELATED: Hypersonic Weapons: The Biggest Warfighting Disrupter Since Stealth Is ComingTech, Industrial, Medical, Consumer Giants Top Investing Action PlanDefense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry News
"
83,NOC,"The most disruptive battlefield technology since the advent of stealth may be just a few years away, and the U.S. is locked in a race with Russia and China to develop it first.XHypersonic weapons are being designed to travel at five times the speed of sound, rendering their targets nearly defenseless and promising to rewrite battle plans around the world.""We still want to have stealth capabilities, but I would like to argue that hypersonics give you next-level capabilities,"" said Mark Lewis, chair of the Institute for Defense Analyses' Science and Technology Policy Institute. ""With stealth, they can't see me. With hypersonics, even if they do see me, there's not a lot they can do to stop me.""The Pentagon awarded contracts last year for hypersonic test vehicles, and prototypes are expected in 2020. Later this year, a separate contract for a hypersonic strike weapon to be launched from fighters and bombers will be awarded to either Lockheed Martin (LMT), Northrop Grumman (NOC), Boeing (BA), Raytheon (RTN), or Orbital ATK (OA), which is being bought by Northrop. Meanwhile, China and Russia are expected to field hypersonic weapons sometime in the next decade.A Rand Corp. report last month highlighted the disruptive potential of hypersonic weapons, warning that even a relatively small hypersonic arsenal could threaten a major power's forward-projected forces, or even their homelands.Deeper into the future, aircraft equipped with hypersonic technology could further disrupt warfighting or even commercial airspace. And outer space could become more accessible with hypersonic vehicles as more companies look to low-cost launch options.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.Eventually, hypersonics could be a multibillion-dollar opportunity for the aerospace industry. But the price of each weapon system is still unknown because too few weapons have been built to get a good figure, Lewis notes.In addition to warfighters, Pentagon number crunchers could see upside in the new technology as well. While individual hypersonic missiles would be more expensive than conventional ones, some argue that firing hypersonics, which are more deadly, could prove more effective on targets and less expensive in practice, he adds.""It's part of the discussion we are having today,"" Lewis said.To be sure, hypersonic weapons wouldn't be the fastest on the planet. Traditional intercontinental ballistic missiles fly at 20 times the speed of sound. But they follow predictable trajectories.Existing missile-defense systems like Lockheed's Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system (THAAD), Boeing's Ground-Based Midcourse Defense system and Raytheon's Patriot system all work by predicting where and when incoming missiles will land.But hypersonic weapons combine speed, range and maneuverability to take unpredictable flight paths, making them extremely difficult, if not impossible, to shoot down with today's technology.""So our radars and antimissile missile systems aren't really designed to defend against them, in theory,"" said Greg Zacharias, chief scientist of the Air Force.That means aircraft carriers, the linchpin of America's ability to project force abroad, would be vulnerable to hypersonic weapons, severely limiting where they could operate.But at the Association of the U.S. Army conference earlier this month, Tim Cahill, vice president of air and missile defense at Lockheed, said some of its existing systems like THAAD and Aegis ""have a lot of capability right now against"" hypersonic targets even though they weren't designed to take out those types of weapons.The company is working on enhancements, like improving radars and command and control systems. But existing systems still have areas that minor adjustments won't address. While Cahill wouldn't give a specific timeline, he acknowledged a need for larger modifications that will take years to complete.""With something as disruptive as hypersonics, all services will have to rethink how they do business,"" said Fred Kennedy, director of the tactical technology office at the Pentagon's secretive Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa).The Missile Defense Agency has requested more than $75 million to research potential methods for defending against hypersonic weapons.There is also a window to intercept hypersonic weapons in their initial, or ""boost,"" phase when they behave more like regular ICBMs, says Ian Williams, director of the missile defense project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.But for now, the U.S. doesn't have an operational boost-phase defense system.On the flip side, America's adversaries would be unable to defend against hypersonic weapons screaming toward them, making them optimal in time-critical situations.If the U.S. saw North Korea or another hostile power readying a missile for launch, an American hypersonic weapon could be quickly deployed and take out the missile before it took off, Zacharias says.The U.S. military has flirted with hypersonic weapons technology on and off for years. But a new urgency has taken over as U.S. adversaries and emerging powers pursue hypersonics.The White House Office of Management and Budget released a report in August listing hypersonic weapons and defenses as a top research and development priority. And the administration's fiscal 2018 budget request includes $292.5 million for hypersonic science and technology. That's up from just $79 million spent in 2012. Then there's the contract for a hypersonic weapon expected to be awarded by the Pentagon this year.Those efforts would build on a breakthrough that came with the 2013 flight of Boeing's X-51 Waverider, which provided proof that hypersonic technology was feasible.Now Darpa is looking at two major technologies: a tactical boost glide vehicle and the Hypersonic Air-Breathing Weapon Concept (HAWC).The glider concept envisions a rocket that carries a weapon to Mach 5 or above. Once that speed is reached, the weapon would separate from the rocket and ""glide"" at hypersonic speed to its target. Last year, Darpa awarded Lockheed a $147 million contract to build a prototype.The HAWC envisions a ""scramjet"" hypersonic engine, which would use its forward trajectory to compress incoming air, instead of relying on an oxidizer like a rocket does. Without the extra fuel, the engine is lighter and can fly faster. In 2016, Darpa awarded Raytheon a $174.7 million contract and Lockheed a $171.2 million contract for the HAWC. Zacharias says prototypes are on track for delivery in 2020.In an earlier interview with IBD, Orbital ATK predicted hypersonic weapons would become a reality in the next five years, saying the company has the technological know-how to manufacture hypersonic vehicles.Meanwhile, Russia is working on a hypersonic glide vehicle as part of its Project 4202, and China is developing its own DF-ZF hypersonic glider. Russia is also developing the 3M22 Zircon hypersonic missile. India is working on its own hypersonic missile, the BrahMos II, with Russia. Australia, Japan and some European countries have hypersonic programs as well.""Interest in (hypersonics) seems to really be spiking in the Pentagon, in part because some other countries like China have gotten extremely active in this technology area themselves,"" said Andrew Hunter, director of the Defense-Industrial Initiatives Group at CSIS.Further into the future, the Air Force is looking at hypersonic drones and vehicles that don't need to be launched from an aircraft or rocket.Lockheed's secretive Skunk Works division and Aerojet Rocketdyne (AJRD) have been working on a proof-of-concept plane as an update to the iconic SR-71 Blackbird spy plane.The new unmanned vehicle would fly at Mach 6, twice as fast as its predecessor, thanks to a traditional turbine engine that takes the plane to Mach 3, coupled with a scramjet engine that propels the SR-72 to hypersonic speeds. The plane could be ready for use by 2030.""The technology is mature,"" Rob Weiss, Lockheed's Skunk Works chief, told IBD in July. Hypersonics are ""ready to be demonstrated. There has been steady progress to advance the technology, which is our primary focus now.""And if you combine hypersonic aircraft with hypersonic missiles? That could enable an attack into defended airspace ""at nearly any location across a continent in less than an hour,"" according to Lockheed.The Air Force's Zacharias said commercial players could be interested in using hypersonic scramjet engines to get flights into orbit because it would be cheaper than using a rocket.Lower-cost access to space is becoming a bigger commercial priority amid plans to launch new satellite constellations.The technology could reduce travel time from the U.S. to Tokyo to three hours, says John Hernandez, senior analyst at the Frost & Sullivan consulting firm. That's down from more than 12 hours on a nonstop commercial flight today.And hypersonics don't have the same problem with sonic booms that supersonic jets have, because they fly higher in the atmosphere.Still, significant government participation would be needed for commercial development.""It's hard to imagine a startup company having the resources to invest in the levels needed to make space applications possible,"" Lewis said. ""That's the government's role. One realm that NASA can contribute to is civilian applications.""RELATED:Pentagon Looks To Speed Up These Missile Defense SystemsAs North Korea Threat Looms, Here's How U.S. Missile Defense WorksWhat Lockheed's Secretive Skunk Works Unit Sees For The 6th-Gen.

87,NOC,"The Air Force wants to make a decision on a $7 billion airborne command and surveillance program next month.XAir Force Secretary Heather Wilson said the service will hopefully make a decision on whether or not to keep the Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS) recapitalization program in October, Aviation Week reported Wednesday.But what is the program and why is the Air Force considering scrapping the bid? Here are five things to know about the JSTARS recap.Boeing (BA), Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Northrop Grumman (NOC) are leading teams with bids for the aircraft. The Boeing team is offering a modified version of its top selling 737-700 commercial jet while Lockheed is working with a Bombardier (BDRBF) Global 6000 business jet and Northrop's offering is a modified Gulfstream G550 business jet. The planes will replace the current fleet of Northrop E-8s.Boeing shares were up 0.6% in premarket trading on the stock market today. Lockheed and Northrop were flat.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.After 16 years of high-tempo operations in the Middle East, the current fleet of E-8s are facing maintenance issues as the fleet ages. But the service and Northrop are also working on a plan to update the fleet's central computers and improve the radar to keep the plane flying until 2030, removing the urgency of the recap, IHS Janes reported.Some officials want to network various aircraft, drones and sensors as a temporary measure until industry develops a more survivable system.The Air Force acknowledged earlier this month that it's evaluating ""alternative approaches for battlefield command and control that could be more effective in high-threat environments,"" according to Defense News.At the Air Force Association conference last week, Defense Secretary James Mattis noted different ways of doing the JSTARS mission but didn't directly talk about the future of the program itself.""I just talked to chief of staff of the air force; we are standing here in front of the room talking about new ways to do the JSTARS mission,"" Mattis said. ""I'm eager to hear these efforts to help one another, the other services.""Georgia lawmakers wrote a letter to Mattis saying they would block any move to stop flying the current fleet without a replacement.""While the rationale has not yet been made known to us, canceling or delaying would be ill-advised and directly impact our combatant commanders who employ this asset in theater,"" Sen. Johnny Isakson, Sen. David Perdue, Rep. Austin Scott, Rep. Sanford Bishop and Rep.

89,NOC,"Weapons made by Boeing (BA), Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Raytheon (RTN) could get new infusions of money, as the Pentagon looks for ways to accelerate U.S. defenses amid rapidly advancing North Korean nuclear and missile threats.XThe Defense Department has asked Congress to shift $416 million into missile defense programs, some of which are classified, from Army and Army Reserve operations and maintenance accounts, according to a Sept. 7 request obtained by Defense News.The programs poised to get more funding include upgrades to Lockheed's shipboard Aegis systems, so they can launch Raytheon's Standard Missile-3 Block IIA, Raytheon's Cobra Dane surveillance radar, and Raytheon's sea-based X-band radar, which floats on a Boeing platform.The Pentagon also wants to boost the number of ground-based interceptors in Fort Greely, Alaska, to 64 from 44 and add 20 missile silos. Boeing's Ground-Based Midcourse Defense system is located there.At a recent Capitol Hill hearing, Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Joseph Dunford alluded to the spending-transfer request, and said, ""We looked at additional radar systems. We looked at THAAD systems, Patriot systems.""Lockheed makes the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, and Raytheon makes the Patriot air-defense system.Lockheed shares were down 0.3% at 309.19 on the stock market today, but still above a flat-base 308.58 buy point.

Iraqi forces said they had seized the headquarters of Kirkuk's provincial administration in the north of the country on Monday. Kurdish KAR Group stopped pumping crude at the Avana and Bai Hassan deposits, an official at the central government-run North Oil said. About 600,000 barrels a day was being exported through a Kurd-controlled pipeline to Turkey, a different person familiar with the matter said earlier.""The reports out of Iraq are the driving force,"" Michael Lynch, president of Strategic Energy & Economic Research in Winchester, Mass., said by telephone. The potential for a loss of supply from the region is on investors' minds and ""it is undoubted that the market psychology is affected,"" he said.Iraqi forces said they've captured a refinery, a gas plant and other facilities, state-run Iraqiya television reported. Kurds stopped pumping oil at the two fields in Kirkuk as technicians failed to report for work and some security guards left amid the military conflict, according to the NOC official. The halt could affect 275,000 barrels a day in output, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg.Tanker-tracker analysis company Kpler said it didn't see any significant change on shipments from the region for now. Oil was still flowing through the export pipeline, the Kurdistan Regional Government's Ministry of Natural Resources said later on Twitter.""The Iraqis are flexing their muscle,"" Thomas Finlon, director of Energy Analytics Group in Wellington, Fla., said by telephone. ""It's unlikely that it escalates to anything serious. I'm not too concerned about a flash point at all.""WTI for November delivery added 42 cents to settle at $51.87 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange after earlier rising to as high as $52.37 a barrel during the session.Brent for December settlement increased 65 cents to end the session at $57.82 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The global benchmark traded at a premium of $5.68 to WTI for the same month.Iraq is the second-largest producer in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, and pumps most of its 4.47 million barrels a day from fields in the south, shipping it from the Persian Gulf port of Basrah. The country's Kurdish region in the north, meanwhile, relies on a pipeline to the Turkish port of Ceyhan to get most of its crude to market. The conduit also transports some 100,000 barrels a day from federally run fields in Kirkuk.

94,NOC,"NATIONAL HARBOR, Md. — Defense Secretary James Mattis said Wednesday he has talked to the Air Force chief of staff about ""new ways"" to perform a key airborne command and control ""mission,"" following recent questions about whether the $7 billion program would go forward.XThe Air Force opened the competition late last year on the Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS) recapitalization program to replace Northrop Grumman's (NOC) E-8.Boeing (BA), Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Northrop are leading teams with bids for the aircraft, which would perform airborne command and control and conduct ground surveillance.But the Air Force acknowledged last week that it's evaluating ""alternative approaches for battlefield command and control that could be more effective in high-threat environments,"" according to Defense News.Top service officials have said an alternative approach to having a single aircraft would be to instead network various aircraft, drones and sensors as a temporary measure until a more survivable system is developed.On Wednesday, Mattis didn't directly address the JSTARS program but noted different ways of doing the JSTARS mission.""I just talked to chief of staff of the air force; we are standing here in front of the room talking about new ways to do the JSTARS mission,"" said Mattis at the Air Force Association's annual Air, Space & Cyber conference.

A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.Mattis also called for more communication with industry partners, especially in Silicon Valley, to ""find the best bang for the buck.""He told service leaders to ""find the most far-reaching innovations out there"" by being open to talking to industry leaders, ""within the bounds of ethical regulations.""""Make certain the lines of communication are open in a way that we can aggressively and swiftly take advantage of opportunities that we see developing around us in the private sector,"" Mattis said.He said the Pentagon is working to reform business practices inside the Defense Department and is taking a look on how to quickly take advantage of technology such as software development.""Do we really need the same process when we're doing small programs vs. a major aircraft program?"" Mattis asked.The Pentagon has been embracing Silicon Valley with its Defense Innovation Unit Experimental (DIUx) program, which seeks to tap into the tech sector to help keep the Pentagon on the cutting edge.Mattis recalled his time living in Silicon Valley after he left the Marine Corps, saying that ""nothing is more reminding of just how innovative America is than to live in Silicon Valley and see how they are changing the world we live in.""RELATED: Air Force Eyes Light-Attack Plane But This Is 'Job One'Defense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsWhy The Orbital ATK Buyout Is So Important For Northrop Grumman

Apple (AAPL) fell sharply amid iPhone and Apple Watch concerns while oil prices topped $50.

Some recent breakouts, such as Apple and Tesla (TSLA), faltered during the week. Several other stocks topped buy points, but not by much and in light volume.Crowds were light for the iPhone 8 as it went on sale Friday, confirming reports of light pre-orders, as many customers await the high-end iPhone X due Nov. 3.

The acquisition will give Northrop key missile-defense assets as Orbital builds the interceptor boosters for the Boeing (BA) Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system used by the U.S. Missile Defense Agency. The deal could even help Northrop beat out Boeing to win the Air Force's Ground Based Strategic Deterrent contract to replace the aging Boeing Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile system. The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2018 and will be a test case to see if the Trump Administration and Pentagon still have concerns over the size of prime contractors.RELATED:Why The Orbital ATK Buyout Is So Important For Northrop GrummanOPEC and noncartel members did not extend or deepen production cuts at Friday's meeting, but a move for increased monitoring and other steps hinted that production would not soar in 2018.

(TOL) and KB Homes (KBH), as well as construction equipment maker Graco (GGG), wood products producer Louisiana-Pacific (LPX) and steel maker Allegheny Technologies (ATI).XMastec (MTZ) and manufactured-home builder Patrick Industries (PATK) also earned a spot on the list, as did Kimball International (KBAL), which makes furniture for the office and hospitality industries, and home furniture maker Bassett Furniture Industries (BSET).Institutional investors also continued to show demand for top chip stocks, with IBD 50 members Applied Materials (AMAT) and Lam Research (LRCX) making the cut, along with Cohu (COHU) and Texas Instruments (TXN).Cohu and Lam Research can also be found on IBD's latest list of stocks expecting 50% earnings growth in Q3.With tensions rising in North Korea and President Trump promising to significantly boost defense spending, it's no surprise that major defense contractors Boeing (BA), Northrop Grumman (NOC) and Heico (HEI) are also found on the list.In last month's report, top fund managers invested over $1 billion each into four stocks: United Health (UNH) ($1.39 billion), Apple (AAPL) ($1.36 billion), Electronic Arts (EA) ($1.25 billion) and Celgene (CELG) ($1.07 billion).The latest list doesn't include any $1 billion-plus bets. The largest total investment was in Boeing, with 23 funds picking up approximately $223 million of shares.Next in line was Bank of America (BAC), with 27 funds investing $178 million. The company got an additional vote of confidence from Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) CEO Warren Buffett, who told CNBC on Oct. 3 that he would hold BofA shares for a ""long, long, long time.""Bank of America reports Q3 earnings on Oct. 13.Boosted by recent institutional buying, most stocks on the list — including Thor Industries (THO), Winnebago Industries (WGO) and KB Homes — have already broken out and are now extended.But several remain in or near a potential buy zone, including Mastec, Boeing, Toll Bros. and the New York Times (NYT), which has pulled back in recent days and is now testing support at the 50-day line. Note that Toll Bros. is trading at the upper limit of its buy range, while Boeing is now extended.While General Motors (GM) made the list of new buys, with five funds investing $1.2 million, it also led the list of new sells. The net number of funds selling GM (16 selling minus 5 buying) was 11.Diesel and gas engine maker Cummins (CMI) had the second-most net sellers (10), followed by axle and suspension maker Dana Inc. (DAN) (9).Despite the number of funds selling, each of these stocks has been rising, and Cummins entered a 170.78-179.32 buy zone last week.RELATED:Q3 Earnings Preview: Stocks Expecting 50%-Plus GrowthU.S. Small Caps, Foreign Stocks Favored By FundsFind And Track The Best Mutual FundsLooking For The Next Nvidia?

"
100,NOC,"Northrop Grumman's (NOC) $9.2 billion acquisition of Orbital ATK (OA) will give the defense giant key missile-defense assets as the sector heats up on increased threats from North Korea and could help it win an important nuclear modernization contact.XRaytheon (RTN), Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Boeing (BA) dominate the missile defense space, and Orbital builds the interceptor boosters for Boeing's Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system used by the U.S. Missile Defense Agency. It also builds target vehicles for tests.Northrop built the control system for the GMD, but doesn't have much in way of launchers, and the Orbital deal would help Northrop expand its capabilities and catch up to rivals, as well as ""broaden and deepen"" its space portfolio, Pete Skibitski, a Drexel Hamilton analyst, said in a research note.""The missile/missile defense front is the most intriguing aspect of this combination,"" he wrote. ""Adding Orbital ATK clearly makes for a stronger portfolio.""It could even help Northrop beat out Boeing to win the Air Force's Ground Based Strategic Deterrent contract to replace the aging Boeing Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile system. Last month, the Air Force awarded Boeing $349 million and Northrop $328 million in initial contracts, with a final contact decision expected in 2020.The Northrop-Orbital deal also could be a sign that companies and government funding are shifting towards missiles and missile defense.""It looks like the two companies combined are making a bet on the growth in space and missiles,"" Andrew Hunter, director of the Defense-Industrial Initiatives Group at CSIS, said in an interview.  ""They are betting the (Defense) Department is going to make the room required (in the budget) to purchase a lot of missiles and other weapons.""Orbital shares soared 20% to close at 132.25 on the stock market today. Northrop climbed 3.4% to finish at 275.97, clearing a 274.71 buy point in a new flat base. Northrop retook its 50-day moving average on Friday.IBD'S TAKE: Ready to invest but don't know where to start? An easy to follow routine from IBD can help you grow and protect your money over the long term.Northrop will pay $7.8 billion in cash and assume $1.4 billion in debt. That comes out to $134.50 a share for Orbital, a 22% premium to Orbital's Friday close of 110.04. Orbital was at the high end of a buy range from a 105.19 entry as of Friday's close.The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2018 and Orbital will operate as a new business sector within Northrop for the foreseeable future, according to executives from both companies on a conference call Monday.Northrop management said the deal will add to earnings a year after it closes, and stressed there is little overlap between the two companies.But Orbital's ammunition offerings might be spun-off in the future.""From an ammunition perspective, we're not big fans of adding ammo capability to Northrop's portfolio, given we don't see a large land war breaking out anytime soon,"" Skibitski said.Ivan Feinseth, chief investment officer for Tigress Financial Partners, said in an interview that he expects no objections from the Pentagon or Federal Trade Commission over the deal.But Vertical Research Partners aerospace and defense analyst Rob Stallard noted that this will be the first major defense acquisition of the Trump administration era. ""This is a test case as to whether concerns over the scale of the primes is still an issue,"" he wrote.Boeing could also make a counterbid as some aspects of missile defense and precision munitions are important to the aerospace giant, but those are rare, he wrote.The deal could spark more merger and acquisition activity in the defense space.""I think this and the Rockwell/United Technologies deal would suggest there is a move towards consolidation,"" Hunter said.But investors might not see companies on the lookout for more missile defense or space companies per se as the sector shrinks.""Interest in other companies may not be a directly comparable move. We are at a state in the industry where there is only so many moves you an make, but that doesn't mean you can't make a move in another direction.""The U.S. and its allies have ramped up missile defense testing and deployment as North Korea continues its missile testing and reportedly has an ICBM that can hit the U.S.In May, Boeing's GMD system was launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California and successfully intercepted a target ICBM fired from the Marshall Islands. It was the 10th successful test in 18 attempts, but prior tests have failed, including two tests in 2010 that were carefully scripted with the dimensions, trajectory and speed as known factors.Meanwhile, Lockheed's THAAD system is currently deployed in South Korea, Guam and Alaska. In July, the U.S. Missile Defense Agency announced that its THAAD system in Kodiak, Alaska, successfully intercepted an intermediate-range ballistic missile for the first time in a test. So far, the system has a perfect 14-out-of-14 record in tests since 2005.Raytheon makes the popular Patriot system, which is useful against conventional weapons and has a range of just 12 miles, while Lockheed produces the Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) interceptor missiles.RELATED:As North Korea Threat Looms, Here's How U.S. Missile Defense WorksBoeing May Challenge United Tech's Buyout Of Rockwell CollinsDefense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry News

But there are several sectors and specific industry groups that are faring well, with Dow components Boeing (BA), Chevron (CVX) and Home Depot (HD) in or near buy zones.IBD'S TAKE: Don't rely on market pundits telling you where they think the market is heading next year. Listen to what the market is saying right by following the major market averages and leading stocks. Read IBD's Stock Market Today columns throughout the market day, and the end-of-day The Big Picture (open access through Oct. 8) for timely analysis.Facebook had been trading tightly in a flat base just below a buy point. But shares fell 4.5% to 162.87 on Monday in heavy volume, tumbling below their 50-day moving average and undercutting the low of their current consolidation. Tesla extended its post-breakout reversal to more than 7% below its 370.10 entry — and through its 50-day to boot — making that buy point invalid. Nvidia round-tripped a 9.5% gain from a buy point, sinking 4.5% to 171, below the 174.66 entry. Apple fell 0.9% to 150.55, following a 5% sell-off last week.Facebook, Tesla and Apple shares did rise a fraction in premarket trading Tuesday. Nvidia climbed nearly 3% after announcing late Monday that it will supply AI-focused chips to several Chinese cloud-computing and server firms.Oil and gas groups and stocks continue to rack up big and steady gains, as crude oil prices have rebounded to their best levels since April.Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) and Valero (VLO) have cleared buy points, while BP (BP) and the Dow's Chevron are close.The key question for these stocks and the broader sector is whether oil and other energy prices keep rising — and when and how quickly shale operators ramp up their production.U.S. crude futures dipped 0.4% in premarket trading to $52 a barrel.Despite Tesla's recent reversal, the broad transportation sector is healthy, from shipping giants FedEx (FDX) and UPS (UPS) to General Motors (GM) and Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) to trucking firms J.B. Hunt Transport (JBHT) and Old Dominion Freight Line (ODFL) to auto- and truck-parts firms such as Dana (DCN) and Lear (LEA) to RV makers Winnebago (WGO) and Thor Industries (THO).Focusing on single-industry success stories, IBD's Aerospace/Defense group is faring well.

General Dynamics (GD) is close.Hilton Worldwide (HLT), Marriott International (MAR), and Hyatt Hotels (H) are among several hotel operators that have broken out. But they've generally broken out on light-to-lackluster volume. Casino stocks have been doing well, though Melco Resorts (MLCO) fell below a buy point and Wynn Resorts (WYNN) nearly did so.D.R.

More than two dozen stocks in it advanced more than 1%.Blue chips were mostly up. In the Dow Jones industrial average, four stocks rose 1% or more: Caterpillar (CAT), Boeing (BA), General Electric (GE) and JPMorgan (JPM).Boeing is in a buy zone up to 258.92.

Citigroup (C) climbed about 2%, clearing a 69.96 buy point in volume 30% above average. Morgan Stanley (MS) padded its cushion above its 50-day line with a 1.7% gain. The best thing for the bank stocks would be an interest rate hike. But the Street isn't expecting one when the Federal Reserve concludes its two-day meeting Wednesday.Why then are bank stocks up today? Analysts at Goldman Sachs said the banks should benefit when the Fed starts unwinding its stimulus by reducing bond holdings.In the IBD 50, a proxy for leading stocks, chip designer Nvidia (NVDA) gapped up for the second straight session. Friday's 6% gap up constituted a breakout above a 174.66 buy point. Midday Monday the stock gapped up 5%.China-based online gamer NetEase (NTES) jumped 7% in heavy volume but remains about 13% off its high.Brazil stocks continued to rally Monday, but many are beaten down.

European bourses rose modestly intraday.Several chip stocks broke out in Friday stock market trading, including a pair of iPhone chip stocks clearing cup-with-handle buy points in strong volume. That's notable because Apple suppliers had been building sound bases, sometimes flirting with buys, but not really joining their key customer in the buy zone. That raised some doubts about Apple's own breakout, especially with the stock moving sideways for several weeks.Skyworks, which briefly topped a 108.65 buy point intraday on Sept. 5, advanced 2.3% to close at 109.55. Texas Instruments rose 1.8% to 84.78, above an 84.34 entry and hitting a 17-year high.Are these just brief forays into buy zones or the start of a broad advance? One sign will be whether other iPhone chip plays follow suit.Broadcom briefly topped a buy point in late July but then reversed, falling sufficiently to make the old entry point invalid. Broadcom has since formed a new flat base with a 258.59 buy point. Broadcom tested that entry point late last month as the flat base was forming, but didn't close above it. Shares climbed 1.5% on Friday to 250.55, moving back above it 50-day moving average.Qorvo is in a cup base, and just completed a handle, giving it a lower entry point of 75.81. Qorvo jumped 2.7% to 75.49 on Friday, just below that entry.Applied Materials is a chip- and design-equipment giant. It's not a direct iPhone supplier. But some analysts have pegged it as an iPhone play, citing its OLED-related operations. The Apple iPhone X will boast an OLED screen, which is already being used by Samsung on some handsets.Applied Materials tried to break out of a cup-with-handle base on Friday, rising to just hit the 47.69 buy point. But shares pulled back, closing up 0.2% at 47.14.Intel has become a recent supplier of iPhone chips, though you wouldn't want to call the world's largest semiconductor maker an ""Apple play."" But you can say that Intel is near a buy point. Intel surged 5% last week to 36.96, just 2% below a 37.60 double-bottom base. Intel's Relative Strength line has been lagging in 2017 and really for the last several years, reflecting the stock's underperformance vs. the S&P 500 index.For its part Apple rose 1% to 159.88 on Friday, finding support near its 10-week line. That snapped a three-day mild decline following mild disappointment over the late release date for iPhone X. Apple remains in range from a 156.75 flat-base entry.Apple iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus preorders began on Friday. While the tech giant may not indicate how those orders went, big wireless operators, electronics retailers and analysts may give their own estimates of demand. The iPhone X won't go on sale until Nov. 3.RELATED:The Big Picture: More Breakouts Ahead Of Fed Meeting These Chip Stocks Broke Out In Bullish Trading ActionTwo Chip Equipment Stock Breakouts: Similar Bases, With Key DifferencesChip Stocks To Watch And Semiconductor Industry NewsHow To Invest In The Stock Market: Start With A Simple RoutineStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

114,NOC,"The Pentagon has picked Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Raytheon (RTN) to advance to the next stage of a competition for new nuclear-armed cruise missiles that could be launched from bombers like Northrop Grumman's (NOC) forthcoming B-21.XThe Long Range Standoff (LRSO) weapon will replace aging AGM-86B Air Launched Cruise Missiles made by Boeing (BA). Those missiles were initially fielded in the early 1980s.The LRSO is meant to hit targets from long ranges without putting bombers at risk of getting shot down. But critics have charged that the Pentagon doesn't need the LRSO as the B-21 is supposed to be stealthy enough to elude enemy air defenses.Lockheed and Raytheon each received $900 million contracts to develop the technologies for the LRSO and demonstrate the new weapon's reliability, the Air Force announced late Monday. The service will then pick one company to manufacture the LRSO, whose cost has been estimated at $20 billion-$30 billion.The Air Force plans to start fielding the next-generation nuclear cruise missile in the late 2020s. Meanwhile, the B-21 is expected to enter service in 2025.""This weapon will modernize the air-based leg of the nuclear triad,"" said Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson in a statement about the LRSO. ""Deterrence works if our adversaries know that we can hold at risk things they value. This weapon will enhance our ability to do so, and we must modernize it cost-effectively.""Shares of Lockheed were flat on the stock market today, but still above buy range. Raytheon rose 0.1%, also above buying territory. Boeing ticked up 0.1%, and Northrop eased 0.6%.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly-traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? Leaderboard is having its best month of the year and the YTD distance is showing a 60% increase over the S&P 500.Earlier this week, the Pentagon awarded Boeing and Northrop with similar early-stage development contract for new nuclear ballistic missiles to replace Boeing-made Minuteman IIIs.The Pentagon will then award a single, final contract for the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent in late fiscal 2020, with deployment seen in the late 2020s. That contract will be worth up to $85 billion, according to the Pentagon's Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation. However, the Air Force has put the number around $62 billion.Those contracts will build on earlier deals to upgrade strategic bombers and submarines.In 2015, Northrop was awarded a contract to build the B-21 bomber that replaces the Cold War-era Boeing B-52s. Development and procurement costs are expected run as much as $80 billion.The Navy has a program underway to replace its Ohio-class nuclear missile submarines. The Columbia-class subs, which are being built by General Dynamics (GD), are expected to be deployed in the 2030s and carry an estimated acquisition cost of about $100 billion.RELATED:Here's How Lucrative A Nuclear Missile Deal May Be For Boeing, NorthropWhat Trump's Afghanistan Strategy Means For Defense StocksMissile Defense Stocks Boosted As Trump's Nuclear Offense Claim DebunkedDefense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsThe Dow's Top Stock Finally Has A New Entry Point

119,NOC,"THE PENTAGON — The Air Force is canceling a recapitalization of its airborne command and surveillance aircraft, budget documents showed Monday, and plans to retire newer bombers but keep the Cold War-era Boeing (BA) B-52s flying.X The Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System is not funded in the 2019 presidential budget, two days after Defense News reported that the Air Force is canceling the JSTARS program in favor of linking systems together to perform the same tasks.""It's got to be survivable, that is the key. If we recap current JSTARS we have an aircraft that does what it does now,"" Air Force Deputy Assistant Secretary for Budget, Maj. Gen. John Pletcher, told reporters. ""It's probably  able to do less because we'll be in a more competitive, contested environment.""Boeing, Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Northrop Grumman (NOC) were leading teams with bids for the $7 billion new aircraft program to replace the current fleet of Northrop  E-8s.The service is unsure what the new family of platforms might look like. Pletcher said it could include putting current sensors on drones like the MQ-9 Reaper or other assets in space or on the ground.The cancellation of the JSTARS recap wasn't a surprise as the Air Force has been critical of the platform since last fall.In November, Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson said the current system of one large plane with a radar system on its belly meets less than 5% of a combatant commander's requirements. But the JSTARS replacement, also envisioned as a large plane, would meet less than 1% of requirements under current threats.This came after Defense Secretary James Mattis said in September that he has talked to the Air Force chief of staff about ""new ways"" to perform a key airborne command and control ""mission.""""Boeing understands the U.S. Air Force has many competing priorities to address within the budget,"" Boeing said in a statement. ""We look forward to working with the U.S. Air Force as it defines its path forward.""Boeing, a Dow Jones component, rose 3.3% on the stock market today. Lockheed advanced 1.3%, and Northrop Grumman gained 1.4%.

But rather than step away completely, it's more important than ever for investors to stay in step with the market. For our latest market analysis, be sure to read The Big Picture.The Air Force  is getting more planes in the 2019 budget, requesting $10.7 billion for 77 Lockheed F-35s, $2 billion for 24 Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornets and $3 billion for 15 Boeing KC-46 tankers.The service also announced that it will begin retiring the Rockwell Collins (COL) B-1 and Northrop B-2 bomber fleets once Northrop starts deliveries of its secretive B-21 be in the mid-2020s.""As part of our decisions presented in the FY19 President's Budget, the Air Force will update the B-52 bomber fleet and fund development of replacement engines,"" Wilson said in a statement. ""We will also continue necessary B-1 and B-2 modifications to keep them relevant until the B-21s come on line.""The decision to keep the older B-52 and not the newer B-1s and B-2s was due to maintenance, total cost and mission capability, according to the Air Force's statement.Overall, the 2019 presidential budget's $686 billion defense spending plan would also give troops a 2.6% pay raise and add 16,400 service members to the ranks.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Defense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsThese 5 Defense Contractors Stand Out In Stock Market Correction

123,NOC,"America's strategy shift in Afghanistan from counter-insurgency to counterterrorism is good news for helicopter and drone makers as well as Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 program, according to analysts.XIn a speech late Monday, President Trump acknowledged his flip-flop from supporting a full withdrawal to approving a continued presence. While he announced no specifics about troop numbers or a timeline for the war in Afghanistan, he did say U.S. won't be ""nation-building again. We are killing terrorists.""This shift in focus will change the requirements for weapons systems needed in the war.""American troops will do a decapitation campaign similar to what is going on in Yemen,"" Phillip Lohaus, a research fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, said of Trump's policy. ""What that means is essentially more of a reliance on drone strikes and on raids and less of a reliance on troops as a stability presence.""While the stealth fighter isn't deployed in Afghanistan, Trump's seeming commitment to the war there could good long-term news for the F-35, which has high-end sensors that can act like a linchpin guiding other air and ground forces as well as drop bombs and support raids, Lohaus said.Trump's policy is also good for munition makers like Lockheed, Raytheon (RTN) and Boeing (BA), whose Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) kit, which turns ""dumb"" bombs ""smart.""Lohaus also said to expect more major munition drops like the Massive Ordnance Air Blast, which was used earlier this year in Afghanistan.Lockheed shares closed up 1% at 304.80 on the stock market today, Boeing added 1.7%, and Raytheon gained 1.4%.Helicopters are used to ferry troops and supplies as well as provide air cover.

The classified drone program is mostly operated by the CIA and Trump did not specifically mention it in his speech Monday night.Northrop Grumman (NOC) makes the Global Hawk, which provides intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance information, and privately held General Atomics makes the Predator drone.Northrop shares rallies 1.9%. AeroVironment (AVAV), which makes smaller drones, jumped 5.1%.Lohaus said that the speech wasn't good news for ground vehicle makers as the focus on counterterrorism means the U.S. is unlikely to have a large footprint.""In the past, work focused on training and equipment,"" he said.

125,NOC,"REDONDO BEACH, Calif. — Northrop Grumman (NOC) and NASA's James Webb Space Telescope, which will be launched next year, will probe deeper and see more than its predecessor, the Hubble.XLockheed Martin's (LMT)Hubble has returned mind-blowing images of black holes and nebulae since its launch in 1990 while producing breakthroughs in how we understand the universe, but researchers needed a more advanced system to probe further into space, especially to see how early stars and galaxies formed.""NASA wanted something that answered two questions: Are we alone in the universe and where did we come from?"" said Scott Willoughby, telescope program manager for Webb prime contractor Northrop, in a recent interview.The Webb telescope will be 100 times more sensitive than the Hubble, thanks to its 18 hexagonal mirrors, built by Ball Aerospace. Each mirror is over four feet across, forming a primary mirror 21.3 feet across. Hubble's primary mirror is just under eight feet across.The Webb telescope can also fix itself, unlike the Hubble, which required astronauts to fix the focus it a few years after launching in 1990. But because the Webb will be a million miles from Earth vs. the Hubble's 300-mile distance, a similar repair job won't be possible.Willoughby said the Webb has seven motors on its mirrors to ""change the prescription"" of the lenses and it takes just seconds to move the mirrors and change the focus.And unlike the Hubble, the Webb will capture infrared light, as its giant mirrors will be protected from picking up heat and light from the sun.Northrop built five massive sun shields from Kapton, a film made by Dupont (DD) that won't distort in the extreme cold of outer space.""The material has been used on smaller applications, but this is the first time it will be used as a giant umbrella application,"" Willoughby said.The price tag on Webb telescope also tops the Hubble's. The total estimated life cycle cost for the new telescope is $8.8 billion, which includes the operating costs for the first five years and for two years of data analysis, according to NASA. The Hubble's initial costs along with five years of operation and data analysis costs amount to $7.5 billion in today's dollars.Shares of Northrop were down 0.2% on the stock market today but still above buy range. Webb subcontractors Orbital ATK (OA) and Harris (HRS) were down 1.4% and 0.2%, respectivelyIBD'S TAKE: Northrop, Lockheed and Raytheon are already past their buy points. But fastener distributor and logistics services leader KLX could be ready to break out. On Monday, Northrop said that all five of the telescope's sun shield layers have been installed and fully integrated, and the company is now folding the 70-by-40-foot sheets to fit into an Ariane 5 rocket in time for deployment tests scheduled for later this month.The telescope is scheduled for an October 2018 launch from French Guiana. It will take six months for the telescope to unfurl its sun shields and mirrors, calibrate its instruments, cool down and reach its destination. Then the research can begin.One of the first missions will be taking a closer look at three planets in the TRAPPIST-1 system, which was discovered last year and could have the right conditions to support life.RELATED: The B-2 Maker Is Also A Stealth Chip Giant And Competes Commercially

126,NOC,"Defense stocks rose Tuesday as President Trump said ""all options are on the table"" after North Korea fired an unidentified ballistic missile over the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido.XAccording to reports, the missile appeared to be an intermediate-range ballistic Hwasong-12 that can fly up to 3,000 miles.North Korea has been more active with missile tests this summer and is reportedly able to put nuclear weapons on ballistic missiles that can reach the U.S. Late last month, North Korea tested a missile with an estimated range of 6,000-6,500 miles, long enough to strike cities in the continental U.S.Defense companies have seen an uptick in interest in missile defense systems as the tests continue.""Obviously this creates opprotunty for defense contractors, especially those with some kind of missile defense"" said Ivan Feinseth, chief investment officer for Tigress Financial PartnersHe also said it was good for companies that provide satellites tracking and monitoring.Lockheed Martin's (LMT) Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system is also deployed in South Korea — to the objection of China, which complains that the system's radar could be used for offensive purposes.Raytheon (RTN) makes the Patriot system while Lockheed produces the Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) interceptor missiles. Boeing's (BA) Ground-Based Midcourse Defense system is deployed in Alaska to protect the U.S.Lockheed shares were up 1.5% at 308.06 in the stock market today. Raytheon rose 2.2% to a new high of 182.11, Boeing edged up 1.4%, General Dynamics (GD) added 1.6%, and Northrop Grumman (NOC) climbed 1%.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly-traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now?

127,NOC,"PALMDALE, Calif. — With new sensors and airframe upgrades, Lockheed Martin's (LMT) legendary U-2 spy plane could stay flying for another 40 years or more, which would mark a century of secret reconnaissance from the program.XThe U-2, nicknamed ""The Dragon Lady,"" first flew in 1955 and for decades took photos over war zones and enemy airspace. The Air Force had plans to retire the program in 2019 to save money, but then changed its mind as demand for battlefield intelligence surged during the U.S. campaign against ISIS.The U-2 aircraft in service now were built in the mid-1980s and have about 15,000-16,000 flight hours on them, a fifth of the 75,000 total hours that the planes were designed to withstand, Kyle Franklin, Lockheed's U-2 program director, told IBD at the company's secretive Skunk Works facility""It's an old program,"" he said in an interview. ""But 85% of the life cycle is still left in it.""To keep the high flying spy planes in airworthy shape, Lockheed completely takes apart the U-2 every seven years and rebuilds it to conduct structural inspections and do preventative maintenance.No new U-2 planes are expected to be built, but Franklin is ""confident"" that the existing ones could be flown through the 2040s and could even be ""fielded to 2060 and beyond.""Lockheed shares were down 0.1% at 296.78 in late-afternoon trading on the stock market today, but still above buy range.IBD'S TAKE: Lockheed stock is extended out of buy range, but you can find other top stocks near a buy range among IBD's review screens that sort out stocks poised for a breakout and give detailed chart analysis.Before the U.S. spied on adversaries with satellites in space, there was the U-2, which flies at the edge of space at 70,000 fleet, twice the elevation of commercial airliners. Pilots wear a specialized flight suit that resembles something astronauts wear in space and during long missions eat food, such as caffeinated pudding, out of a tube.During the Cold War, U-2 pilot Gary Powers was shot down over Russia in 1960, then pictures taken on a U-2 mission two years later sparked the Cuban Missile Crisis. The plane was also used in the Vietnam War, and during the first Gulf War it monitored Iraqi troop movements and the location of Scud missiles.Today, U-2s look for IEDs in Iraq and Afghanistan and are also used by NASA to track weather data and can be deployed as part of peacetime rescue operations.As the plane's missions evolved, updates were needed. In the 1990s, it was outfitted with new engines. And in the early 2000s, pilots got an updated cockpit that lowered the cabin pressure from that experienced at 30,000 feet, which is roughly the height of Mt. Everest, to the equivalent of 15,000 feet.The latest improvement for the venerable U-2 is smaller, updated sensors, allowing the plane to hold more reconnaissance technology. Lockheed declined to offer more detail.Next year, Lockheed will start test-flying the U-2 with Raytheon's (RTN) updated ASARS-2B radar system, which has increased detection ranges and improved image quality vs. prior versions.Mark Cole, Lockheed's director of business development at the Skunk Works and a former U-2 pilot, said as new technology enables sensors to get smaller, more of them can go on the plane.""As the sensor technology matures, you can put more technology on it,"" he said.The U-2 is also being modernized to meet the Air Force's goal of Open Mission Systems, which is meant to make subsequent updates quicker and cheaper.Lockheed is currently working with the Air Force to figure out a road map and budget guideline for the U-2, and that should be completed sometime this quarter.But don't expect an unmanned system as a future update for the U-2.""We revisit it every 10 years or so,"" Franklin said. ""It can be done, but is it solving a problem? For some of our missions, a man in the loop is very important.""Cole called Northrop Grumman's (NOC) Global Hawk a ""complementing system"" and said that ""the U-2 can do stuff the Global Hawk can't.""RELATED: Defense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsWhat Lockheed's Secretive Skunk Works Unit Sees For The 6th-Gen.

128,NOC,"Missile defense providers Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Raytheon (RTN) rallied to new record highs Wednesday after President Trump vowed to unleash ""fire and fury"" against North Korea amid reports that its nuclear weapon and ballistic missile programs are advancing more quickly than expected.XTim Cahill, the vice president of Lockheed's Air and Missile Defense business, told Reuters on Tuesday that interest in its missile defense systems has increased in the last 12 to 18 months.Last month, a Lockheed Terminal High Altitude Area Defense battery in Alaska intercepted a test missile launched from an Air Force cargo plane near Hawaii. The THAAD system is also deployed in South Korea — to the objection of China, which complains that the system's radar could be used for offensive purposes.Meanwhile, South Korea and Japan are having Raytheon upgrade their Patriot systems. NATO member Poland signed a memorandum of understanding to buy Patriot systems after Trump visited that country in July, and the State Department approved the sale of seven Patriot Configuration 3+ defense systems for another NATO partner, Romania.Shares of Lockheed climbed 1.6% to 304.82 on the stock market today, Raytheon jumped 2.3% to 178.75. Both are above buy range. Among other defense contractors, Northrop Grumman (NOC) rose 1%, also hitting a new high and above buy range, while General Dynamics (GD) gained 1.4% to retake its 50-day average.IBD'S TAKE: Lockheed and Raytheon's stock are extended out of buy range, but you can find other top stocks near their buy range among IBD's review screens that sort out stocks poised for a breakout and give detailed chart analysis.On Wednesday, Trump also implied that he's made America's nuclear arsenal more powerful, though defense observers have pointed out that new weapons won't be fielded until the next decade.My first order as President was to renovate and modernize our nuclear arsenal. It is now far stronger and more powerful than ever before....— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 9, 2017In January, Trump signed an executive order for the Pentagon to start a Nuclear Posture Review, but a purchasing plan to modernize the system was started by the Obama administration and isn't expected to be completed until the 2020s.The Pentagon also hasn't awarded contracts yet for new ballistic missiles and nuclear-capable cruise missiles, though they could come this fiscal year. Boeing (BA), Lockheed, Northrop and Raytheon are among the companies vying for the contracts. Deployment of the new ballistic missiles is expected in the late 2020s, and the Air Force plans to start fielding the cruise missiles by 2030.Last year, Northrop was awarded a contract to build the B-21 bomber that replaces the Cold War-era Boeing B-52s, and the Navy has a program underway to replace its Ohio-class submarines, which can launch nuclear missiles. But the B-21 won't enter service until 2025, and the Columbia-class subs aren't expected until the 2030s.RELATED:What Lockheed's Secretive Skunk Works Unit Sees For The 6th-Gen.

129,NOC,"Defense contractors hanging tough in the stock market correction are your stocks to watch this week. Boeing (BA), Lockheed Martin (LMT), Raytheon (RTN), Northrop Grumman (NOC) and L3 Technologies (LLL) have relative strength lines that are at or near highs. Our spotlight on military contractors comes as President Trump on Friday signed a two-year budget bill that will provide the military an additional $165 billion in defense spending.X It's important to stress that in the current stock market correction, these are names to watch for future set-ups, not to buy right now. Stocks that hold up well during a downturn may form new bases and be among the first to break out in a new market uptrend.But if the technicals begin to falter, investors should drop them from their watch lists.The relative strength line is the blue line on the charts below, separate from price action. The RS line shows a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index. Measuring a stock's relative strength is helpful when separating strong stocks from weak ones. An RS line at an all-time high is especially positive.Boeing is primarily a civilian aircraft maker, but it's still a major defense contractor as well. Shares have hit some turbulence amid the broad selloff, but the Dow Jones industrial average stalwart is holding somewhat near its recent peak. The RS  line hit a new all-time high on Feb. 7, even though the major indexes reversed to close the session lower.Boeing shares rose 3.3% as the major averages rose more than 1%.IBD'S TAKE: With the stock market in a correction, this is not time to start making new buys. But rather than step away completely, it's more important than ever for investors to stay in step with the market. For our latest market analysis, be sure to read The Big Picture.Lockheed Martin, the world's largest defense contractor, was able to find support at the 50-day line early this past week. The RS line is holding at a high, even with shares reversing lower for a second trading session.Lockheed shares advanced 1.3%.Military contractors Raytheon and Northrop Grumman have relative strength lines that are continuing to hit new highs as well, and they too were able to find support at the 50-day line this past week.Raytheon and Northrup shares climbed 1.5% and 1.4%, respectively, on Monday.L3 Technologies is the only defense contractor stock here that is currently testing support at its 50-day line.

130,NOC,"The best sector mutual funds last year thrived in several areas, and the number of funds winning IBD Mutual Funds 2018 Awards jumped to 32 from the previous year's 13.This year the best sector mutual funds represented technology, defense and aerospace, media and telecom, health care and retail. Each of the top-performing sector funds not only surpassed the S&P 500 in the past one, three, five and 10 years, but was also the top fund in its sector ranked by 10-year performance.According to Morningstar, a sector mutual fund invests solely in a general industry — such as technology — or in a more specific industry, like an internet company. But there can be a great deal of overlap among the sectors. For example, Amazon.com featured heavily in three of the five featured sector funds — technology, retail and media — while other FANG stocks held prominent roles as well.The components and weighting within the fund dictate its performance compared with the S&P 500.Technology stocks were among the year's best performers, as institutions flocked to the leading names — like the FANG stocks — in the sector.T. Rowe Global Technology (PRGTX) was the top fund within the U.S. technology sector, coming in with a 47.04% return in 2017, more than doubling the S&P 500's 21.83% return and also trouncing the tech-heavy Nasdaq's 28.2% return. The fund targets potential winners within specific technological themes, like cloud computing.Holdings that drove 2017's outperformance include Big Cap 20 member Salesforce.com (CRM) and FANG stocks Netflix (NFLX) and Amazon.com (AMZN) — a position which has since been sold. The fund also saw big gains from Chinese stock leaders Tencent (TCEHY) and Alibaba (BABA).Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAs of Dec. 31, the fund had nearly 35% of its assets in its top five holdings, which are exhibiting strong fundamental and technical action.New top holdings include dynamic electric automaker Tesla (TSLA) and Broadcom (AVGO). Shares of Tesla moved up 46% in 2017, but have been mostly stagnant since September 2017. Since then, the stock has been trading sideways in a range from 290 to about 360.Meanwhile, Apple-supplier Broadcom fell victim to slowing iPhone sales, as the stock fell 21% from its highs in early February. The stock is consolidating at its 50- and 200-day moving average lines.The defense industry saw strong gains in 2017, as President Trump boosted military spending.  Blue chip stock and defense leader Boeing (BA) paced the advancers with a gain of nearly 90%.Fidelity Select Defense & Aerospace (FSDAX) jumped 34.21% in 2017. Its top holdings include Dow Jones Industrials name Boeing, Northrop Grumman (NOC) and General Dynamics (GD).While Boeing and Northrop — up 32% in 2017 — are extended from recent buy points, General Dynamics hasn't had the same torrid advanced and is near a 229.64 flat-base entry.Social media has become a major segment of the media & telecom sector and no company has a larger social media impact than Facebook (FB).T. Rowe Media & Telecommunications (PRMTX) rose 32.99% in 2017. According to Morningstar, the fund is a bit different from the other sector funds in the communications category. While the fund has several communication tower names like American Tower (AMT) and Crown Castle (CCI), it also looks for high-growth companies that are disrupting the industry, like Amazon.The two tower companies had gains of 35% and 28%, respectively, in 2017. As such, the fund's performance was driven by its top three holdings: Amazon.com, Alibaba and Facebook.In a sector not typically known for large advances, health care fund Delaware Healthcare (DLHIX) put in a strong performance in 2017 with a 32.32% rise.The $512 million fund's performance was driven by its position in Germany-based MorphoSys — which advanced nearly 60% — and is involved in the development and research of antibodies. The foreign biotech is also the fund's biggest position as of the end of January at over 7%.Its top U.S.-based position is ethical drugmaker Eli Lilly (LLY), but that didn't spark the fund's 2017 performance, as the stock only rose about 15% last year.Retailers continue to struggle with the Amazon Effect, creating winners and losers within the sector. The obvious retail winner in 2017 was e-commerce giant Amazon.In 2017, Fidelity Select Retail (FSRPX) delivered a 25.82% return due to its long-term investment in the industry leader Amazon.A whopping 40% of the $2.3 billion fund's portfolio is tied to e-commerce giant Amazon (23%) and Home Depot (HD) (17%). Both stocks were paramount to the fund's return in 2017 and will again in 2018 if their positions remain that big.The Fidelity Select Retail fund has owned Amazon since August 2005 — according to Morningstar — while Home Depot was first purchased in August 2008. Last year, Amazon ran up 56%, accounting for a large portion of the fund's annual gains. The stock is trading near its highs and nearly 30% above its most recent buy point — a flat base's 1,213.51 entry.In the meantime, the home improvement retailer had a solid 41% advance in 2017. The retailer was driven higher by solid consumer spending and a strong housing cycle.

131,NOC,"Boeing (BA) topped Q4 estimates Wednesday and offered upbeat guidance for the coming year as recent tax cuts unlock more investment, which could go toward developing a new passenger jet.X The aerospace giant expects to spend $3.7 billion on research and development in 2018, up from $3.2 billion last year, with capital investment expected to climb to $2.2 billion from $1.7 billion.On a conference call with analysts, CEO Dennis Muilenburg said tax reforms would increase Boeing's ability to invest in innovation as well as the underlying production and supply chain, ""solidifying the business case"" of the new midmarket plane.""If we launch, it would give us additional confidence,"" he added.But the company wouldn't say if it would make a decision on the new plane this year, saying it had a lot of time to do its research and the tax cut didn't change its project time frame of 2024-2025 to start deliveries if it decides to launch a new plane.Muilenburg also said that the decision on the new plane wasn't impacted by talks to acquire a major stake in Brazilian planemaker Embraer (ERJ). But sources earlier told Bloomberg that Boeing would get Embraer engineers' expertise to help jump-start the new midmarket plane.Boeing also said it would use tax savings for training and workplace investments, but it has no plans to increase hiring to make up for rounds of layoffs in recent years.Shares surged 4.9% to 354.27 on the stock market today, hitting a new all-time high. That gave a huge boost to the price-weighted Dow Jones industrial average.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter.Boeing sees full year EPS of $13.80-$14, above consensus views for $12.07, on revenue of $96 billion-$98 billion, above consensus for $94.8 billion, reflecting commercial deliveries of 810-815 planes (up from 763 in 2017). Operating cash flow is expected to increase to $15 billion from $13.3 billion in 2017.During the company's conference call officials said that the outlook could be updated as the impact of tax reform is fully understood.For Q4, Boeing reported adjusted EPS of $4.80, including a $1.74 per-share benefit from tax cuts. That beat analysts' views for $2.91. Revenue climbed 9% to $25.37 billion, beating views for $24.83 billion.Commercial aircraft revenue grew 8% to $15.47 billion. Earlier, Boeing said Q4 commercial aircraft deliveries rose to 209 from 185 a year ago as production rates on the 737 and 787 ramp up.Net orders for 414 commercial planes were booked in Q4, with the backlog at more than 5,800 airplanes valued at $421 billion. The defense backlog was $50 billion, of which 40% represents orders from international customers. Total company backlog rose to $488 billion from $474 billion at the beginning of the quarter.Defense, space and security revenue rose 5% to $5.54 billion. Global services revenue jumped 14% to $4 billion.Boeing didn't record a charge with the troublesome KC-46 tanker for the Air Force this quarter, after racking up $2.9 billion before taxes and $1.9 billion after taxes in charges on the modified 767.Last week Gen. Carlton Everhart, the head of Air Mobility Command, told the Air Force Times that Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration could get final FAA certification for the KC-46 in the next 60-70 days.Defense contractors have had a positive earnings season overall. Lockheed Martin (LMT) beat earnings and revenue forecasts Monday and issued strong full-year guidance.Last week, Northrop Grumman (NOC), Raytheon (RTN) and General Dynamics (GD) topped Q4 profit forecasts, though Raytheon and GD missed on revenue while Northrop beat and gave strong 2018 guidance.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Defense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry News

132,NOC,"Boeing (BA) has received a $6.56 billion contract to continue managing the U.S. missile defense system intended to stop North Korean or Iranian intercontinental ballistic missiles, the Defense Department said.X The sole-source contract announced Wednesday extends Boeing's management role for six more years, through 2023, and brings its total contract to $12.6 billion. It includes overseeing the addition of 20 ground-based interceptors to the 44 already stationed in California and Alaska.North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has vowed to perfect a nuclear warhead and a missile that could hit the U.S. mainland, adding to the urgency of U.S. missile defense efforts. In his State of the Union address on Tuesday, President Donald Trump said, ""North Korea's reckless pursuit of nuclear missiles could very soon threaten our homeland. We are waging a campaign of maximum pressure to prevent that from ever happening.""Boeing oversees development and support of the network of interceptors, sensors and communications links, sharing funding with subcontractors: Orbital ATK (OA) builds the rocket booster, Raytheon (RTN) makes the hit-to-kill warhead, Northrop Grumman (NOC) provides the battle management system and Aerojet Rocketdyne (AJRD) makes the warhead's in-flight guidance system.The Pentagon released an initial $213.8 million Wednesday as a modification to Boeing's current $6.14 billion management, development and sustainment contract, which expires this year.As the Missile Defense Agency's prime contractor, Boeing will manage the accelerated construction of a new 20-missile field at Fort Greely, Alaska, plus the additional interceptors. Boeing also will oversee development and integration of an upgraded warhead known as the ""Redesigned Kill Vehicle.""Confidence in the $36 billion missile defense system was bolstered last week by a new assessment from the Pentagon's operational testing director based on the successful interception in May of a dummy warhead. The system ""demonstrated the capability to defend the U.S. homeland from a small number"" of ICBMs launched ""with simple countermeasures when the"" U.S. employs ""its full sensors/command and control architecture,"" Robert Behler said in a report to top Pentagon officials.Laura Grego, senior scientist for the Global Security Program of the Union of Concerned Scientists, questioned even that carefully hedged formulation. The system has destroyed ""its target fewer than half the 17 times it has been tested, and its record is not improving over time. Since the 2004 deployment decision, the system has a three-for-nine record,"" including the test in May, she said in an email.On Tuesday, General Paul Selva, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters that North Korea's capabilities aren't yet as advanced as Kim purports.North Korea has yet to demonstrate essential capabilities for an ICBM that could hit the U.S. mainland, including maneuvering in space, an adequate guidance system and housing that could protect a nuclear warhead from burning up on re-entry.The capability gap provides ""an opening to have"" a conversation with North Korea about a possible missile test freeze, Selva said.While North Korea's nuclear weapons program is the most advanced threat, Trump has vowed to seek new sanctions on Iran for its continued development of ballistic missiles. Iran maintains it has no intention to develop nuclear weapons, and its nuclear program is constrained by its 2015 deal with the U.S. and other world powers.

Analysts were expecting earnings of $4.06 a share on revenue of $14.75 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research.Lockheed sees 2018 earnings of $15.20-$15.50 a share and revenue of $50 billion to $51.5 billion vs. analyst consensus for earnings of $14 a share on sales of $51.53 billion.Lockheed shares closed up 1.9% to a new high of 351.42 on the stock market today. Boeing (BA), which reports Wednesday, slipped 0.7% to 340.82.Aeronautics unit sales rose 11.8% to $6.04 billion on increased production of the F-35 and deliveries of the C-130 as profit margins widened by 20%. The F-35, the costliest procurement program in Defense Department history, is seeing faster rates of production, and Lockheed met its delivery target last year despite Pentagon warnings that the company would fall short.But the aircraft's performance after it comes off the assembly line has come under scrutiny. A recent report from the Pentagon's top weapons tester found that efforts to improve the F-35's reliability are ""stagnant,"" according to Bloomberg.But Lockheed later defended the program, saying that reliability of the F-35's weapons systems has been improving over successive production lots, with newer jets averaging more than 60% availability.Bloomberg also reported that Lockheed is asking the Pentagon for $212 million for restructuring costs for its acquisition of Sikorsky Aircraft, claiming it will save taxpayers money.Missile and fire control unit sales jumped 30.5% to $2.29 billion on increased air and missile defense deliveries, but space systems unit sales fell 12% to $2.45 billion on fewer government satellite launches.When asked if some of the tax cut savings could be spent on R&D for efforts to develop a boost phase missile defense — shooting down a missile during the ascent phase — during the conference call, Chief Executive Marillyn Hewson said that spending on R&D ""would be right in line for our customers.""Missile defense was highlighted as a priority in Washington's National Security Strategy and National Defense Strategy and Hewson touted a recent test pairing the company's Aegis defense system with the F-35 to spot targets sooner. She also mentioned investments in hypersonics and directed energy R&D.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter.Rotary and mission systems sales climbed 14% to $4.35 billion. But Lockheed still expects a muted year for commercial helicopters. Chief Financial Officer Bruce Tanner said oil and gas will have to stay at $65 per barrel for longer before there will be ramp up in commercial sales.""We're not expecting large increase in commercial helicopters in 2018 and looking flat in 2019,"" he said during the company's conference call. ""But that could change pretty quickly based on oil and gas prices.""Lockheed also said it plans to invest $5 billion in its pension plans to pre-pay through 2021 to see a $1 billion benefit under a new accounting standard.Last week, Northrop Grumman (NOC), Raytheon (RTN) and General Dynamics (GD) topped fourth-quarter profit forecasts, though Raytheon and General Dynamics missed on revenue while Northrop beat.Northrop also lifted its dividend and gave strong 2018 guidance.

137,NOC,"Boeing (BA) earnings and revenue are seen rising, and the aerospace giant could announce even bigger shareholder returns when it releases fourth-quarter results Wednesday.X Analysts expect per-share profit to climb 18% to $2.91, with revenue up 6.6% to $24.83 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research. Boeing has already said Q4 commercial aircraft deliveries rose to 209 from 185 a year ago as production rates on the 737 and 787 ramp up.Boeing's improving operational efficiency has lifted cash flow, and in October management raised its overall 2017 cash flow guidance to $12.5 billion from $12.25 billion.That has raised hopes for bigger shareholder returns, and investors were rewarded in December, when Boeing announced an $18 billion repurchase program and raised its dividend 20% to $1.71.Since then, the White House and Congress have enacted a steep cut in the corporate tax rate, providing companies with even more cash to potentially return to shareholders. Last week, Northrop Grumman (NOC) lifted its dividend and gave strong 2018 guidance.Boeing shares closed down 0.7% at 340.82 on the stock market today and are 3% off a record high set less than two weeks ago.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report.

But Boeing is reportedly only interested in taking full control.And in a surprise turn of events, the U.S. International Trade Commission unanimously ruled against Boeing Friday in a trading dispute with Bombardier, blocking a Commerce Department decision to levy import duties of nearly 300% on C-Series jets. But the verdict can still be appealed by Boeing.Boeing could also give more details about a possible new mid-market jet that analysts have dubbed the ""797."" Last week, United Airlines (UAL) said it was waiting for more information about a new jet before it considered  other possibilities to replace its 757 and 767 planes as airlines look to open routes to smaller cities.Meanwhile, Boeing's KC-46 tanker for the Air Force has been a major headache for Boeing and has racked up charges of $2.9 billion before taxes and $1.9 billion after taxes on the modified 767. Boeing originally planned to deliver the first tankers by the end of 2017, but now the first one won't be delivered until the spring.Last week Gen. Carlton Everhart, the head of Air Mobility Command, told the Air Force Times that Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration could get final FAA certification for the KC-46 in the next 60-70 days.Defense contractors have had a positive earnings season overall. Lockheed Martin (LMT) beat earnings and revenue forecasts Monday and issued strong full year guidance.Last week, Northrop, Raytheon (RTN) and General Dynamics (GD) topped Q4 profit forecasts, though Raytheon on GD missed on revenue while Northrop beat and gave strong 2018 guidance.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Lockheed Martin Beats Earnings, Revenue Views, Guides Profit HighBoeing, Lockheed, Defense Giants Eye 2018 Deals That Could Reshape Sector

""There will be some charges (to earnings) and some noise that will be a little challenging to look through that to see what the outlook is for the rest of the year.""Last week, the Pentagon released the 2018 National Defense Strategy with a shift in focus to ""great power competition"" instead of terrorism, prioritizing high end weapons like Lockheed's F-35 fifth-generation fighter and the nuclear recapitalization program.""I think clearly the fundamentals still remain longer term very positive and .... the National Defense Strategy release last Friday points to helping build the political foundation for budget increases in highly specialized areas of investment"" like space and unmanned systems, said Ken Herbert, managing director at Canaccord Genuity.While the strategy lays out long-term spending priorities, the Defense Department still doesn't have a budget yet for 2018 and Congress continues to lurch through short-term budgets that carry over prior spending levels. Herbert expects ""timing around fiscal '18 budget will continue to be a headwind and negative overhang.""On Wednesday, General Dynamics reported adjusted EPS, excluding the impact of tax reform, up 32.3% to $2.50, beating analyst exceptions.  Revenue rose 8.1% to $8.3 billion, but fell short.Northrop reports early Thursday, and EPS is seen climbing 3.4% to $2.75 with revenue dipping 0.4% to $6.37 billion. Analysts would like to get answers about the failed deployment of Northrop's Zuma satellite, but so far the company has kept quiet about the launch earlier this month, citing the classified nature of the mission.Little is known about the Zuma satellite except that Northrop made it for a government customer and it was supposed to be launched into low Earth orbit. But sources told Bloomberg that the Falcon 9's second stage failed, with both the satellite and the second-stage booster falling into the ocean.Raytheon also reports early Thursday, and analysts see EPS up 7.4% to $2.02 with revenue climbing 9.6% to $6.83 billion. Missile defense sales are in the spotlight as international partners like Romania and Poland look to beef up defenses against Russia with new Raytheon-built Patriot systems.In general, ""international sales will be asked about a lot because that's been very strong,"" Canaccord's Herbert said, as the Trump administration has pushed for more foreign sales vs. prior administrations.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter.While Lockheed is typically the first defense contractor to report, its results come out next week, on Jan. 29. EPS is seen jumping 25% to $4.06 with revenue up 7.3% to $14.75 billion.With international demand for Raytheon's missile-defense products rising, sales of Lockheed's Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system will also be scrutinized.Windau also expects more commentary on F-35 production, as it ramps up to full tilt, as well as progress on cutting costs.

141,NOC,"Northrop Grumman (NOC), best known for the B-2 stealth bomber and Global Hawk drone, also makes millions of semiconductors each year for use in military and civilian products — and competes against commercial chipmakers.XAt foundries in Redondo Beach, Calif., and Linthicum, Md., Northrop produces thousands of different types of semiconductors, including a couple of million monolithic-microwave integrated-circuit units, for use in satellite, air and ground systems.About 95%-98% of the chips required for its defense systems are sourced in-house, but Northrop's chips are also used in commercial airplanes and products used in homes.""We cover everything from in-home up to spacecraft and everything in between,"" said Chris Brown, the company's director of microelectronics products and services, in an interview.While the Pentagon has emphasized using commercial off-the-shelf technologies to help lower acquisition costs and speed up weapons development, there are limits to that approach that encourage Northrop to retain complete control over its chipmaking process.For one, chips from the commercial sector carry security risks, such as vulnerabilities to hacking.While there aren't many security concerns with the hardware of chips themselves, the software and firmware loaded onto the semiconductors have risks, said Francis Sideco, a senior director at IHS Technology.Supply-chain security is another worry, with Sideco pointing to fabless companies. Firms like Nvidia (NVDA) and Broadcom (AVGO) design chips and send them to foundries outside the company to actually make them.""If you don't have full control of how that semiconductor is built and delivered to you, other elements could be inserted that could compromise your security,"" he warned.Also, technology used for Pentagon and NASA missions have particular requirements, with Brown noting that there is a very specific process used to qualifying a device for space. ""No one else has these technologies we have.""But Northrop's commercial offerings help keep costs lower on defense-only products as the additional demand keeps the foundries humming and spreads out costs, said Brown.Roughly half of Northrop's processors are sold to others in the defense sector or to commercial customers, but the top-performing ones are kept for government use only.""That's the core of our business,"" said Brown.Northrop has for several years been working with gallium nitride for its chips, which is more efficient, smaller and lighter than silicon, and found it's good for use in commutation, radar and electronic-warfare systems.Brown wouldn't name Northrop's prime competitors but said their GaN chips compete with others in the space. Toshiba, NXP Semiconductor (NXPI), which is being bought by Qualcomm (QCOM), and Cree (CREE) are leading commercial GaN companies in the market.GaN chips currently account for less than 1% of the total semiconductor market, according to a report by the business consulting firm Grand View Research, but demand is growing from areas like hybrid and electric vehicles along with solar power and satellites.Northrop also has its sights set on 5G applications after the Federal Communications Commission allocated spectrum for 5G mobile broadband use last year — and said it has the capacity to double or triple overall circuit production, depending on demand.""With the FCC reallocation of frequency bands we can leverage the same tech we've been using for government contracts into the commercial marketplace,"" Brown said. ""In the government there are cycles, so in lull times we can build our backlog with these commercial jobs which keeps our cost low and keeps quality high because of constant throughput.""RELATED: Boeing, Apple Could Build A Parallel Internet In Space

Revenue is expected to fall 7.2% to $22.96 billion, as commercial aircraft deliveries in Q2 fell 8% to 183.""It will be interesting to see commercial jet profit just as you're starting to see the 737 Max phase in,"" said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace consultant at Teal Group. ""They know how to build a next-generation 737, but how will they transition into a profitable 737 Max with 777 numbers coming down? More and more profitability is now depending on the 737 line.""On the defense side, more charges are a possibility.Last month, the Air Force said it doesn't expect Boeing to deliver the first of its new tankers until next year, over delays getting FAA airworthiness certifications and completing flight tests, despite assurances from Boeing that deliveries would start by the end of this year.Boeing has said the issues related to the KC-46 tanker are over.

Total program costs are seen rising nearly 2% to $1.53 trillion.But at an Air Force Association breakfast Tuesday, Gen. Mike Holmes, commander of Air Combat Command, said the stealth fighters offered the best bang for the buck.""The most cost effective option to recap our fighter force is the F-35. That will provide us unparalleled capability in that mutli-dimensional contested battle,"" he said.Lockheed shares edged up 0.3% to 286.47 on the stock market today. F-35 subcontractor Northrop Grumman (NOC) was up 0.4% to 262.76, just moving out of range.Holmes said the service's goal is to acquire 60 F-35 per year but said that the service should be buying 80 to 100 new F-35s a year to drive the average age of an Air Force jet down from 27 years old currently.The SAR out Monday detailed the Air Force's plans to only buy 60 F-35s a year, pushing the acquisition range out by six more years to fiscal year 2044, adding to costs.But the U.S. and allies are banking on the new jet to be the backbone of their fighter fleets for decades to come.""I can't overstate how essential that weapon system will be,"" Holmes said of the F-35.Gen. Amir Eshel, chief of staff of Israel's air force, called the plane ""game changing,"" according to Holmes, saying that Israel found new information when flying the F-35 earlier this year that other reconnaissance and intelligence gathering systems had missed.In November Israel announced that it would buy 17 more F-35s bringing it total order to 50.Germany is also reportedly interested in buying the F-35.

Boeing (BA) rose 2.7%, and Lockheed Martin (LMT), whose United Launch Alliance joint venture with Boeing provides launch services for the Pentagon, added 0.7%.IBD'S TAKE: A new Space Age is dawning as billionaires like Elon Musk and Amazon's Jeff Bezos look to explore deeper into the final frontier and make space exploration and commercial development more affordable.  Little is known about the Zuma satellite.  Northrop made it for a government customer and was supposed to be launched into low Earth orbit, where the International Space Station, reconnaissance, weather and communications satellites reside.And whether the Zuma had a military or civilian applications or which agency would operate it was also kept under tight wraps, though it reportedly was a spy satellite.The lack of basic details surrounding the launch was highly unusual even compared to SpaceX's national-security launches — a Boeing X-37B for the Air Force in September and a spy satellite for the National Reconnaissance Office in May — where the customers and some details of the payloads were disclosed.A botched Zuma mission could raise some doubts as upstart SpaceX looks to launch more government payloads and test its human capsule later this year.It may also delay its first Falcon Heavy launch scheduled for later this month, potentially affecting other planned contracts for the new rocket.Sometime early this year, the Falcon Heavy is set to launch a Arabsat satellite built by Lockheed. And as soon as April, SpaceX's Falcon Heavy will be used in the U.S. Air Force's Space Test Program-2 mission, which is comprised of military and scientific research satellites.YOU MAY BE INTERESTED IN: SpaceX, Boeing To Take This Giant Leap For Space Industry In 2018Boeing, Apple Could Build A Parallel Internet In SpaceDefense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsSpace Industry News And Top Aerospace Stocks

151,NOC,"If your ETF tumbled in the market sell-off, consider it a good sign if it's bouncing off the 50-day moving average.X That's what iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense (ITA) is trying to do, after it came 10.6% off its Feb. 1 peak. Shares are near the 50-day line. If it bounces back above the line, it would give the ETF a follow-on entry. But bear in mind that the stock market is on shakier ground, and buying any stock or ETF is riskier right now.The fund's so-far bullish reaction mirrors that found in the charts of its major components. Boeing (BA) is near new highs after making a second pullback to the 10-week moving average, a cousin of the 50-day average plotted on weekly IBD Charts.The company — the largest iShares U.S. Aerospace holding, accounting for more than 12% of  its portfolio — is seeing strong demand for its commercial jets, despite stiff competition from Airbus (EADSY). Reports say Boeing will form a joint venture with Embraer (ERJ) on the Brazilian company's regional jets.United Technologies (UTX) (8% of the portfolio) briefly erased a 13% gain from its 123.38 buy point before it bounced back temporarily. Lockheed Martin (LMT) (nearly 8%), Raytheon (RTN) (6.5%) and Northrop Grumman (NOC) (about 6%) have risen from pullbacks to the 50-day line.While the commercial plane business is helping mainly Boeing and its suppliers, the defense side of the ETF is witnessing its own boom. The Pentagon's National Defense Strategy published last month shows a shift from anti-insurgency warfare to fighting traditional foes such as Russia and China.""With the heightened focus on near-peer adversaries, such as China and Russia, we believe support for increased defense spending, and more importantly some of the specific areas of focus, will remain high,"" analysts at Canaccord Genuity noted in a Jan. 22 report.In the Defense Department paper, nuclear forces, cyberspace warfare, missile defense and command and control systems were some of the areas where modernization is planned, and where major defense contractors could play significant roles.Aerovironment (AVAV), Kratos Defense & Security (KTOS) and Cubic (CUB) are smaller holdings of iShares U.S. Defense that Canaccord says have high percentages of their business in defense. The fund has 40 total holdings.Defense spending rarely goes out of fashion, and the fund has a good long-term track record. As of year-end, its three-year average annual total return is 19.2%, the five year return is 23.9% and the 10-year is 12.1%, according to the iShares website.RELATED:Boeing's Cash Flow Could Jump 35%; Lockheed Cash Boom Also SeenLockheed Martin, Raytheon Missile Defense System Fails Test Over Hawaii2 Defense ETFs Near Buy Points As U.S. Faces North Korea ThreatBoeing, Embraer Will Reportedly Form Commercial Jet Joint Venture

154,NOC,"Japan and South Korea are considering adding the short takeoff/vertical landing variant of Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 to their fleets, according to reports, potentially allowing the U.S. allies to project power farther as regional tensions heat up.X Both countries are already buying scores of the conventional-takeoff version, the F-35A, but having the F-35B in their arsenals would enable them to deploy the stealth fighters from ships, not just from land bases.South Korea's Yonhap news agency said military officials are looking at the F-35B for its Dokdo-class amphibious assault ships. Seoul already has one of the 14,300-ton, 653-foot ships and a second is scheduled for deployment in 2020, according to Military.com.Meanwhile, Japan is mulling the F-35B for use on its helicopter carriers as it looks to defend its smaller islands against China's growing maritime presence, government sources told The Japan Times.The U.S. Marines approved the F-35B for combat in 2015, and a squadron is deployed in Japan. The U.K. and Italian air forces will also operate the F-35B.Lockheed shares were up 0.8% at 322.10 on the stock market today, just below a 322.29 buy point. Northrop Grumman (NOC), a key subcontractor on the program, rose 0.7%, and United Technologies (UTX), which makes engines for the F-35, added 0.4%.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.The F-35Bs would complement the significant commitments from the two countries. South Korea has ordered 40 F-35As and earlier this month announced plans to buy 20 more, while Japan has ordered 42 F-35As.Interest in additional stealth fighters comes as North Korea has made rapid progress on its nuclear and missile programs.Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., said last month that it's possible for the F-35 to shoot down nuclear missiles from North Korea or Iran with its Raytheon (RTN) AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missiles just seconds after takeoff.Boeing's (BA) F-15 could also be used if it had the right sensors but the stealthy fifth-generation F-35 already has key sensors installed, Aviation Week noted in a report earlier this month.In particular, Northrop has developed the F-35's infrared AN/AAQ-37 sensors that serve as an aircraft and missile warning system and the jet's fire control radar. The company has been testing the sensors on ballistic missiles for several years, according to the report.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Boeing, Lockheed, Defense Giants Eye 2018 Deals That Could Reshape SectorDefense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsPentagon's No. 2 Has This Confusing 'Mindset' On Lockheed's F-35

155,NOC,"Boeing (BA), Lockheed Martin (LMT), Northrop Grumman (NOC) and other defense contractors have key contracts in their sights in 2018 that could reshape the industry for years to come.The Air Force is looking for a new trainer plane to replace its aging fleet of Northrop T-38C Talons and will decide in July who receives about $16 billion to produce 350 aircraft.X A Lockheed Martin-Korea Aerospace Industries team is offering the T-50A, an upgraded version of the T-50 already in service in South Korea. Boeing is working with Saab to build a clean-sheet design. Italy's Leonardo is offering the T-100, but is a very long shot.The stakes are especially high for Boeing, which needs a new fighter contract as F/A-18 E/F Super Hornet production slows and demand shifts to Lockheed's next-generation F-35. If Boeing loses, it could be forced to make major job cuts at its St. Louis plant. Boeing showed off its offering recently.Lockheed is touting the proven effectiveness of the T-50A and says it can be ready on day one for the Air Force, which is looking to field the fighters as quickly as possible. On the other hand, Boeing's new design is seen as having ""more robust"" capabilities  and offers pilots extra flexibility in the cockpit.""Each team thinks they are the obvious right choice,"" said Andrew Hunter, director of the Defense-Industrial Initiatives Group at CSIS. ""I think the possibly of a bid protest is high because the companies are so convinced they are right.""Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace consultant at Teal Group, gives the T-50A a slight advantage: ""They have no upfront costs and it's a highly cost based contract, a classic price shoot out.""The Navy is looking to field the first carrier-based drone for aerial refueling, and a contract award is expected in September. The Pentagon has earmarked $2.16 billion for the program through fiscal 2021, though the contract's total value would be larger.The competition is down to Lockheed, Boeing, and privately held General Atomics after Northrop Grumman announced it was dropping out of the race in October.Before dropping out of the contest, Northrop was seen as one of the front-runners as its X-47B prototype had been used in take off and landing demonstrations from aircraft carriers.Now, Lockheed is likely in the lead as its offering would be able to handle upgrades to strike and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities, said Mark Bobbi and Derrick Maple, experts at IHS Markit. But if cost is the main concern then General Atomics is the likely winner.By the end of March, the Air Force expects to award a contract for hypersonic strike weapons that can fly five times the speed of sound and would be launched from fighters and bombers.Lockheed, Northrop, Boeing, Raytheon (RTN), and Orbital ATK (OA), which is being bought by Northrop, are bidding on the contract.Hypersonic weapons could be the most disruptive battlefield technology since stealth, combining speed, range and maneuverability to take unpredictable flight paths, making them nearly impossible to shoot down with today's technology.The contract will help push the Air Force to ""accelerate the development of hypersonic technologies"" a spokesman for the service said as China and Russia race to close the gap in technology.High-tempo operations in the Middle East and rising tensions in Europe have put a priority on fielding modernized ground vehicles. The Army plans to award two engineering and manufacturing development contracts by the end of 2018 for a new light tank.So far, bidders include General Dynamics (GD), BAE Systems and a team led by Science Applications (SAIC), according to Defense News.The Marine Corps is also expected to decide between BAE Systems and Science Applications for its Amphibious Combat Vehicle contract in 2018. The service plans to build 204 of the vehicles to replace its aging amphibious assault vehicle fleet.Key foreign contests will formally kick off in 2018, though awards will come later.By mid-2018, France and Germany plan to agree on a roadmap for jointly developing a next-generation fighter. But the new jet is unlikely to be available by 2025, so Germany is looking at Boeing's F-15 and Super Hornet as well as Lockheed's F-35 as possible stopgaps until then.India expects to open competition for a carrier-based fighter jet by the middle of the year. New Dehli is in dire need of new planes as its 900 fighters, mostly Russian-built aircraft, are nearing the end of their service lives.Finland is in the market for 64 jets to replace its Boeing F/A-18 Hornets and will ask for offers from Boeing and Lockheed early next year along with some European firms.

156,NOC,"WASHINGTON — Deputy Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan wants the ""mindset"" that the Pentagon's costliest weapons program ever, Lockkheed Martin's (LMT) F-35, is churning out stealth fighters at full tilt — even though it's nowhere near that level.X His remarks contrast with the typically careful language from other program officials, who have been very deliberate about their choice of words to be as transparent as possible in describing each step in the controversial $400 billion program, which has been blasted for being over-budget and behind schedule.This year, Lockheed delivered 66 F-35s, and will start production and delivery of 90 jets in 2018, as low-rate production ramps up. Lockheed expects to hit-full rate production of 160 jets per year by 2023.But at a press briefing Thursday, Shanahan said Lockheed has reached full-rate production:""How do we really leverage up on the performance there? They've gone now from a development status to full-rate production. So since we've got this steady state of full-rate production how do you make that, you know, run like a sewing machine?""Lockheed shares closed down 0.2% at flat at 317.19 on the stock market today. Northrop Grumman (NOC), a top F-35 subcontractor, dipped 0.7%. United Technologies (UTX), which makes the F-35's engines, rose 0.2%.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.Lockheed has been gearing up for full-rate production at its factory in Fort Worth, Texas, and hiring more workers. But acquisition rules require full combat testing certification, or Initial Operational Test and Evaluation, before the F-35 can advance to the full-rate phase.Shanahan is no stranger to the specific terminology used by Pentagon's acquisition programs as he was Boeing's (BA) senior vice president for supply chain and operations until his appointment to the Pentagon's No. 2 spot in July.When pressed about his choice of words by reporters, Shanahan acknowledged he wasn't technically correct. But in his mind, the program is already at full-rate production and that if it waited until 2020 to ""start behaving differently, I think we've missed an opportunity.""""We should be thinking about the mindset and behaviors and how we are leveraging productivity of a full-rate environment,"" he added, saying he doesn't think Lockheed has a long way to go with its production ramp-up.The company said in a statement that Shanahan recently toured Fort Worth production line and is on track to meet increasing production rates as well as support Initial Operational Test and Evaluation next year.The Pentagon's F-35 joint program office said in a statement that the the program is ""moving at a full sprint,"" noting that ""over the next five years"" the F-35 will see the largest growth across its development, production and sustainment efforts.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Hypersonic Weapons: The Biggest Warfighting Disrupter Since Stealth Is ComingDefense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

Airline stocks plunged as United Airlines (UAL) said it would expand rapidly, setting the stage for a renewed price war.X The S&P 500 index, Dow industrials and Nasdaq all rallied solidly to hit fresh record highs as earnings season heated up. The falling dollar, which has acted as a tailwind for U.S. multinationals' stocks and profits, rebounded from three-year lows Thursday as President Trump said he expects a stronger greenback. Netflix (NFLX) was a big earnings winner. Intel (INTC) also did while after Texas Instruments (TXN) and Lam Research (LRCX) were among several leading chip stocks to struggle on earnings. Airline stocks plunged on United Airlines (UAL) while Apple (AAPL) and iPhone-related stocks sold off as several analysts cited evidence of weaker iPhone X demand.Shares rocketed to record highs as Netflix (NFLX) added 8.33 million streaming subscribers worldwide, crushing its fourth-quarter target of 6.3 million. The Internet TV streaming giant ended 2017 with 117.58 million total streaming subscribers, with one analyst predicting 200 million Netflix subscribers in 2020. The gains came despite Netflix implementing price hikes to its service plans in the U.S. and Europe. Netflix credited hit original content such as TV series ""Stranger Things"" and ""The Crown"" and movies like ""Bright"" for its subscriber gains in the period. For the March quarter, Netflix is predicting it will add 6.35 million net new subscribers.Chipmakers Intel (INTC), Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM), STMicroelectronics (STM) and Xilinx (XLNX) beat their December-quarter targets, but got mixed reviews from investors.

Celgene's acquisition comes as it prepares to lose exclusivity for cancer drug Revlimid in 2022. Juno rivals Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Novartis (NVS) in making CAR-T drugs to treat blood cancers. Sanofi's deal follows two failed mergers in 2016 and 2017.Early Wednesday, Novartis (NVS) reported core earnings of $1.21 per share on $12.92 billion in sales, up a respective 6% and 2% on a constant-currency basis, and easily beating the consensus.

In the end there were five finalists but not enough money to get it done, the organization said in a statement Tuesday.""After close consultation with our five finalist Google Lunar X Prize teams over the past several months, we have concluded that no team will make a launch attempt to reach the Moon by the March 31, 2018, deadline,"" said a joint written statement from Peter Diamandis, founder and executive chairman of the X Prize Foundation, and Marcus Shingles, its chief executive.""This literal 'moonshot' is hard, and while we did expect a winner by now, due to the difficulties of fundraising, technical and regulatory challenges, the grand prize of the $30 million Google Lunar X Prize will go unclaimed,"" the statement went on to say.The contest began in 2007 with privately funded teams started developing plans to launch and land a robotic vehicle to the Moon, make it travel 500 meters on the surface and send video, images and data back to Earth.Twenty-six teams initially entered the race, with $20 million for the first-place winner.

Cigarettes, But One Tobacco Giant Is Holding UpThe Federal Reserve kept to Wall Street's preferred script on Wednesday, leaving its key interest rate unchanged and putting off an announcement that it will begin unwinding its $4.5 trillion balance sheet.The Fed's patience comes as the economy is performing pretty well, with real GDP growing at a 2.6% pace in the second quarter, but inflation and wage gains have been more muted than expected. The combination has been good for the stock market, partly because the prospect of low interest rates has weighed on the dollar, which could be a boon to the earnings of U.S. multinationals in the second half of this year.The decision by the Fed to wait until September to announce a shift in its reinvestment policy — a gradual pullback from its current stance of reinvesting all principal from its maturing mortgage and Treasury bond portfolio — also sent a signal that policymakers aren't overly concerned that financial markets are too exuberant.The next interest-rate hike is expected in December.

Their Dow peer 3M (MMM) was an outlier with an overall miss, and shares tanked.Proofpoint (PFPT) reported Q2 profit and revenue that topped expectations and forecast current quarter sales and earnings just above consensus estimates. Sunnyvale, Calif.-based Proofpoint specializes in email and data-loss protection for corporate networks and cloud-computing infrastructure.

169,NOC,"After taking heat for years over its ballooning acquisition price tag, Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 is reportedly under scrutiny now for the cost to operate and maintain the new stealth fighters.XThe cost to procure 2,443 F-35s for the Air Force, Marine Corps and Navy is about $400 billion. Meanwhile, the cost to operate the fleet over the course of its decades-long service life is estimated at $1.2 trillion.But the Pentagon's chief weapons tester has warned that figure is ""likely to increase significantly"" because the F-35's parts are more unreliable than expected and repairing the jets are taking longer than planned, according to Bloomberg.In a May presentation, the Pentagon's director of operational testing told officials that reliability metrics on ""critical failures have worsened over the last year."" And reliability metrics have fallen again since the May 8 presentation for the Air Force's F-35A and Marine Corps' F-35B variants. But metrics rose for the Navy's F-35C version, according to the report.The availability of spare parts is ""is getting worse, affecting fly rates"" in the more than 200 F-35s based across the U.S. Additionally, 20% of F-35s needing parts have to wait as suppliers struggle to keep up with replacing damaged parts while concurrently boosting production to accommodate the ramp-up of deliveries of new F-35s, according to the presentation.Spare part issues have weighed on fleetwide availability of F-35, which is at just 52% — well below the current goal of 60% and the 80% needed for combat testing expected to start next year.But F-35 Joint Program Office spokesman Joe DellaVedova told Bloomberg that the program is seeing a ""positive effect"" from improved spare-part forecasting and repair times.Lockheed shares rose 0.8% to 280.09 on the stock market today, bouncing higher from a test of their 50-day average but still in buy range. Northrop Grumman (NOC), a top subcontractor on the F-35, climbed 0.9% to 257.52, also still in buy range. United Technologies (UTX), whose Pratt & Whitney unit makes the F-35's engines, advanced 0.7% to 122.46, rising further above its buy zone.The F-35 program has already been struggling against availability issues. All F-35s were grounded earlier this month at Luke Air Force Base in Arizona because some pilots suffered oxygen deprivation issuesAnd last week, all Marine F-35s were grounded at Yuma Air Station in Arizona over software issues with its critical Autonomic Logistics Information System, which is needed for everything from mission planning to maintenance.RELATED: Amid New Russia Threat, Lockheed's F-35, F-22 May Face Biggest Test Yet

170,NOC,"The Air Force has filed a report on restarting production of Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-22 Raptor, and backers of the stealthy air-superiority fighter got shot down.The Obama administration canceled the program in 2009 amid spiraling costs, and the Air Force has maintained for years that restarting the program would be too expensive. It reiterated that stance Wednesday.The Air Force said buying 194 additional F-22s would cost about $50 billion, which includes $9.9 billion for non-recurring start-up expenses and $40.4 billion for aircraft procurement. The price tag for each F-22 to be $206 million-$216 million.""The startup costs are significant and very expensive,"" Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson told reporters, according to the Washington Examiner. ""The chief has assigned a fighter roadmap. Our plan is to put any resources we have into that roadmap and not into restarting a line from an older aircraft.""Amid concerns that U.S. aircraft might lose their ability to dominate the airspace as Russian and Chinese rivals make advances, Congress asked the Air Force last year to produce a report on resurrecting the F-22.Lockheed shares edged up 10 cents to 282.99 on the stock market today, just within buy range of a 270 entry.The F-22 program produced 187 operational planes, less than half the 381 that the Air Force requested.The $200 million-plus unit cost for a new F-22 compares with the $140 million per-plane cost when production ended. Meanwhile, Lockheed is working to push costs of the F-35A, the basic model ordered by the Air Force and most international partners, to under $80 million per plane in 2019 or 2020, down from $95 million under the latest contract.A 2011 RAND study put the cost of building 75 more F-22s at $13.7 billion-$17.4 billion in 2008 dollars, depending on a variety of factors. Earlier this year, United Technologies' (UTX) Pratt & Whitney division said it could start building the F119 engines for the F-22 by December 2020.Instead of restarting the F-22, the Air Force has said it wants to focus investments on its three priorities: Lockheed F-35 fighters, Northrop Grumman (NOC) B-21 bombers and Boeing (BA) KC-46 tankers.RELATED: Amid New Russia Threat, Lockheed's F-35, F-22 May Face Biggest Test Yet

171,NOC,"American taxpayers could soon find out if they got their money's worth from the costliest fighter jets in the U.S. arsenal, as new air-defense systems render the legacy fleet too vulnerable to lead the charge in contested airspace.XRussia's S-400 system, which is deployed in Syria and spreading to other U.S. adversaries, poses a particular threat to ""fourth generation"" aircraft like the F-16, F-15 and F/A-18. Analysts and military officials believe that Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-22 and F-35 as well as Northrop Grumman's (NOC) B-2 bomber could be the only aircraft effective against the S-400 due to their stealth capabilities.""Fourth gen will continue to have a role in some of these other areas we are looking,"" said Lt. Gen. Jerry Harris — the Air Force's deputy chief of staff for strategic plans, programs and requirements — after a Senate hearing in March. ""But, again, as the world grows and these threats proliferate in Syria and Iran and other locations, they are going to push fourth gen out quicker than planned.""The accelerated threat assessment comes as President Trump looks to add at least 100 combat aircraft to the U.S. fleet. He hasn't specified which models will be in the mix but has been critical of the F-35's $400 billion acquisition price tag, hinting it could be pitted against Boeing's (BA) F/A-18 Super Hornet and saying in February that he was ""looking seriously at a big order.""The implications for the defense industry extend beyond Lockheed's F-35, which several U.S. allies are buying in addition to the 2,443 the Pentagon is procuring for the Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps.Boeing is trying to maintain a foothold in the combat aircraft market after losing the B-21 bomber contract to Northrop, and wants to keep its Super Hornet in production despite international demand for more advanced fighters. And last year, Congress asked the Air Force to assess the costs of restarting Lockheed's F-22 program, which was canceled in 2009 less than halfway through its production run due to spiraling costs.For now, the still-limited availability of fifth-generation fighters like the F-22 and F-35 means the backbone of the U.S. fighter fleet will continue to be older planes. The Air Force said earlier this month that it will extend the service life of the F-16 by 50% to 12,000 flight hours as the service hopes to keep the plane flying until the 2040s. And Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David Goldfein recently sounded ambivalent about retiring the F-15 next decade as planned.IBD'S TAKE: The Aerospace/Defense industry group ranked No. 63 Monday among the 197 industries tracked by IBD. While that is down from earlier this year, top defense stocks like Lockheed Martin, Northrop and Raytheon are in buy zones.While U.S. airspace dominance has gone unquestioned for decades, the S-400's introduction has helped tip the scales, and growing tensions with Russia and its allies are making the skies above the Middle East more dangerous.After the U.S. launched Raytheon (RTN) Tomahawk cruise missiles at a Syrian airbase April 6 in response to a suspected chemical weapons attack by President Bashar Assad's forces, the Kremlin vowed to deploy more air defenses to Syria ""very soon,"" according to Russia's Interfax.And on Monday, Russia threatened to target U.S.-led coalition aircraft and drones in Syria after a Super Hornet shot down a Syrian Su-22 that had bombed positions near a U.S.-backed militia combating the Islamic State.""All flying objects, including planes and drones of the international coalition, detected west of the Euphrates, will be followed by Russian air defense systems as targets,"" the Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement.Before the Tomahawk strike, the U.S. had avoided Assad's military. But with the U.S. mission in Syria possibly expanding, American pilots may find themselves intentionally or unintentionally in the S-400's cross hairs.Russia already has one of its S-400 systems in western Syria near Turkey, but it's possible another could be among those deployed to beef up Syrian defenses. Meanwhile, Syrian forces have moved most of their fixed-wing aircraft to Russia's Khmeimim airbase, where the S-400 is also deployed, for protection against another U.S. strike.Russia claims the system can track 300 targets simultaneously and has an operational range of up to 250 nautical miles. China finalized an order for the S-400 in 2015 with delivery expected next year, and an even more advanced S-500 is in the works. Moscow may be exaggerating the S-400's details. But what's widely accepted is that it represents a unique threat to the U.S. because of its ability to detect incoming aircraft from longer ranges.The S-400's radar can spot a fourth-generation fighter before the fighter's radar can pick up the air-defense system, according to Mark Bobbi, an aerospace, defense and security analyst at consultancy IHS. A stealth fighter, however, would only be detectable at close range.The F-22 has 360-degree stealth, while the infrared signature of the F-35's engine makes it more vulnerable from the back, Bobbi noted. Still, he thinks the F-35 ""would lead the parade"" if and when it's deployed to Syria.Even before this month's Tomahawk missile strikes, the shift in the threat landscape was already becoming clear.""We think the only thing that can operate in and through that environment is going to be fifth generation,"" Harris told reporters after the March Senate hearing.F-22s are currently flying in Syria, where they flew their first-ever combat missions in 2014 as the U.S. began hitting Islamic State targets. The Air Force said earlier this year that F-35s will deploy to the Middle East in a few years but have demonstrated their readiness to deploy with recent exercises in Europe and Asia.For more on top business trends and how to make more money in the stock market, follow IBD on Facebook.Maintaining a military edge comes at a cost. The Trump administration has vowed to boost Pentagon spending but is also scrutinizing individual programs.Earlier this year, Defense Secretary James Mattis ordered a review of the F-35's costs as well as options for upgrading F/A-18 Super Hornets. The basic F-35A model costs about $95 million each under the latest production contract, but versions for the Navy and Marines are more expensive. The current Super Hornet version costs $52 million to $61 million, depending on the model.By the time F-22 production ended, the per-plane cost was about $140 million, though total procurement topped $60 billion to get 187 planes in operation. Advocates periodically have called for making more, even though Lockheed has shut down the production line. A 2011 RAND study put the cost of building 75 more F-22s at $13.7 billion to $17.4 billion in 2008 dollars. The Air Force has maintained that a restart would be too expensive and would take away resources from the F-35 and other programs.To be sure, fifth-generation fighters aren't invincible — and aren't invisible.""Even fifth generation would be challenged to penetrate in certain ranges against these very capable air-missile-defense systems,"" said Mark Gunzinger, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments and a retired Air Force colonel, noting China has developed its own ""very advanced"" HQ-9 air-defense system.But he said the S-400 wouldn't create ""no-go zones"" for the U.S. and allies.And a trade-off of stealth fighters is that maintaining a low-observable radar profile means they can't carry as many missiles and bombs under their wings. As a result, fourth-generation fighters can bring more firepower, and there are ways to reduce their detectability too.Boeing has proposed a stealthier version of the Super Hornet, which would have a special radar-evading coating and wouldn't have fuel tanks under the wings, Dan Gillian, Boeing's F/A-18 and EA-18 program manager, said at an industry conference earlier this month.He added that the advanced Super Hornet would be ""complementary"" to the F-35 with its long-range infrared search-and-track system and deeper magazine that holds more munitions than the Navy's F-35C variant can.Fourth-generation fighters won't be obsolete and should continue playing a key role in combat as part of a one-two punch with their stealthier counterparts.Lockheed's website describes the F-35 as the ""quarterback"" of a joint strike force that can ""share what it sees with other aircraft to expand situational awareness across the entire network of aircraft.""Also, pitting a plane against an air-defense system or other threat in a head-to-head competition is the ""wrong way to think,"" said Gunzinger.Instead, the focus should be on how fifth- and fourth-generation fighters — along with jamming aircraft like Boeing's EA-18G Growler, cyber operations and unmanned systems — can work together to take down a threat, he added.""It's a family of systems,"" said the Air Force's Harris. ""It's going to be our fifth generation that goes into a threat environment like that and kick down the door. And then maybe after those threats have been suppressed, allow fourth generation back into the fight.""RELATED:As F-35 Raises Its Profile, How Do You Stop Russian Intel Gathering?F-35s Are Back From Europe: Here's What The Air Force Said Lockheed F-35s Doing 'Exceedingly Well' In South Korea As North ThreatensBoeing's Super Hornet And Lockheed's F-35: Wingmates Or Rivals?

184,NOC,"The Pentagon confirmed that it's been in touch with producers of a ""Top Gun"" sequel, and analysts speculate that Boeing (BA) F/A-18 Super Hornets will likely be the star of the new movie, a public relations bonanza for the aerospace giant as it looks to increase sales at home and abroad.A generation ago, ""Top Gun"" wowed audiences as Navy F-14 Tomcats turned and burned, making inverted dives and other acrobatic maneuvers. But those jets are no longer in service. Options for the sequel include the Lockheed Martin (LMT) F-35 or the Super Hornet.The Pentagon hasn't been informed about which plane will be used in the movie, Philip Strub, director of entertainment media at the Pentagon, wrote in an email to IBD Friday. Earlier he wrote that the movie was still in the ""early stages of pre-production"" and that the DOD hasn't received a script yet.But analysts have some good guesses at which plane will take the leading role.Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace consultant at Teal Group, said that the featured plane ""will almost certainly be the Super Hornet,"" citing logistics and availability of the F-35.Today, the Navy flies Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornets, while the service's variant the F-35 is slated to be combat ready sometime between 2018 and 2019. Tom Cruise, who played Maverick in the first movie, said filming for the new ""Top Gun"" movie is scheduled to start sometime next year.The timing could be tricky for producers of the sequel. The Super Hornet is in the fleet now but isn't the latest-generation fighter jet. The F-35 is a cutting-edge fighter with stealth technology but may not be combat ready in the Navy when filming starts.The Marines' F-35B reached initial operational capability in July 2015, and the Air Force's F-35A was declared combat ready in August 2016. But neither is designed to take off and land from aircraft carriers, which appeared in the original ""Top Gun.""""The F-35 is not really a Navy plane. It's a Marine and Air Force plane,"" Aboulafia said.If the Super Hornet is chosen, its appearance in the movie could be a factor in getting Boeing more orders for U.S. allies. And President Trump has suggested a ""big order"" for the fighter could be on the way.""As far as brand image, you can't beat what 'Top Gun' did for the F-14,"" Aboulafia said. But the F-14 wasn't exported; its only foreign sale was to the Shah of Iran.Without new Super Hornet or F-15 Eagle orders, Boeing faces the possibility of no longer making combat aircraft after it was shut out of the F-35 contract and lost the B-21 bomber bid to Northrop Grumman (NOC).Lockheed could use its own PR boost. The $400 billion F-35 program has been blasted for being over budget and behind schedule. But as the backbone of America's future fighter fleet, the Pentagon must start asking Congress for more and more procurement money as production ramps up, even as Trump and lawmakers on Capitol Hill have piled on criticism.While Boeing's Super Hornet is the likely winner, Aboulafia said the jet is no F-14.The Super Hornet is ""a strike fighter vs. the ultimate machine to destroy everyone in the sky."" He said Lockheed's F-22 would be the more comparable jet to the F-14, but only the Air Force flies the newer stealthy jet.Boeing shares closed down 0.3% at 186.59 on the stock market today. Lockheed shares edged up 0.6%. Northrop, a major F-35 subcontractor, edged up 0.2%.

185,NOC,"The Pentagon's acquisition costs for Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 will rise yet again despite President Trump's assurance that he would lower ""out of control"" costs for the stealth fighter.Acquisition costs for the the advanced fighter will increase by $27.5 billion, to $406.5 billion, according to a Selected Acquisition Report submitted to Congress Monday, the Defense Department's Joint Program Office confirmed late Monday, following a report by Bloomberg News. Acquisition cost estimates for the program had fallen from a high of $398.5 billion in early 2014 to $379 billion currently.That will push total program costs up 1.8% to $1.53 trillion.Vice Admiral Mat Winter, F-35 Program Executive Officer, said in a release that the cost increases were ""largely driven by the adjustments made to the U.S. planned production profile.""The Air Force is cutting the number of F-35A models procured yearly to 60 from 80, which pushes out the acquisition range by six more years to fiscal year 2044. The JPO also said fly away costs for the A model and the Navy's C variant increased  ""due to profile changes"" and the Marines will get 13 more F-35Bs.Fly away costs for the F-35A which includes the engine, went to $111.3 million from $100.6 million in the prior year SAR. Costs for the C model rose to $112.4 million from $110.7 million.But the JPO said prices negotiated with Lockheed and engine maker United Technologies (UTX)-unit Pratt & Whitney ""continue to be below SAR estimates.""Lockheed shares closed up 0.1% to 285.57 on the stock market today, hitting a new record high intraday. The stock is modestly extended from a 270 breakout. Subcontractor Northrop Grumman (NOC) shares dipped 0.1% to 261.78. They're just within the 5% chase zone going up to 262 from the 249.53 buy point.The F-35 is known for being overbudget and behind schedule. But the F-35 program office has pointed out recent cost reductions and said the jet is meeting an adjusted schedule.An April Government Accountability Office found that testing delays could add over $1 billion to the cost of the stealth fighter and delay the Navy's timeline for declaring its version of the jet combat-ready next year. But the Pentagon refuted that figure.Trump has been the biggest critic of the F-35 and vowed to get a better deal from Lockheed and look at more Boeing (BA) F/A-18 Super Hornets for the Navy instead to cut costs.Boeing shares climbed 0.8% to 203.96, further extended out of buy range and hitting a new record high intraday.United Technologies rose 0.4% to 123.06, also hitting an all-time high intraday.RELATED: Amid New Russia Threat, Lockheed's F-35, F-22 May Face Biggest Test Yet

186,NOC,"Dow Jones industrial average component Boeing (BA) has racked up more than $2 billion in extra costs on the KC-46 tanker for the Air Force, but the aerospace giant has learned key lessons from the military program's headaches and integrated them into its commercial aircraft business.The tanker, which is based on a modified 767 airframe, is now in production but ran into delays for development of its refueling boom, wing-mounted air refueling pods, and wiring. CEO Dennis Muilenburg said the company has used those lessons to help deliver the 737 Max ahead of schedule and under budget as well as get the 787-10 into flight testing a month early.""For the first time, we're building a military product, highly modified, in our commercial product line, and we see huge cost advantages to bringing that capability in line in our production models,"" Muilenburg said during the company's conference call. ""But around the edges of that, things like systems installation, wiring installation, the details that go into concurrently designing and building and how to do that most efficiently.""Lessons from the KC-46, which saw $120 million in extra costs in Q1, come as Boeing considers building a brand-new midrange plane dubbed the 797. Boeing has been under pressure to develop a new twin-aisle jet to grab market share back from Airbus and its A321neo jet.As a stopgap measure before the midrange jet launches, Boeing plans to extend its largest 737 Max to limit further losses to Airbus. The so-called 737 Max 10 could be unveiled at the Paris Air Show in June, sources told Reuters.Muilenburg didn't say Boeing's experience with the KC-46 would feed directly into the 797 and 737 Max 10 and declined to offer any details about them, such as the price tag, despite reports of carriers wanting a new plane at around $70 million-$75 million. But he did say Boeing is having productive conversations about the business case for each option.""Our primary focus is engaging with customers and understanding their future needs,"" Muilenburg said.Boeing shares were down 1% to 181.71 on the stock market today, pulling back further from a 185.81 buy point, as Q1 revenue missed forecasts. Rival Airbus (EADSY) dipped 0.6% despite securing a $6 billion deal for 20 A350-900 widebody jets from China Southern Airlines.Boeing's core EPS jumped 16% to $2.01, beating analyst views for $1.95. Revenue fell 7% to $21 billion, under views for $21.35 billion. Commercial revenue dipped 1% to $14.3 billion, as commercial aircraft deliveries fell to 169 from 176 a year ago. Defense revenue declined 18% to $6.5 billion.Total company backlog was $480 billion, up from $473 billion at the start of the quarter. Free cash flow soared to $1.63 billion from $527 million a year ago.Boeing raised its full-year adjusted EPS guidance to $9.20-$9.40, with the midpoint still below Wall Street views for $9.35, from an earlier outlook of $9.10-$9.30, due to a lower-than-expected tax rate.Muilenburg reiterated the company's stance on supporting tax reform and simplifying the tax code hours after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin confirmed that President Trump's tax cut, with a 15% corporate tax rate, will be ""the biggest in history.""Muilenburg, who seems to have the president's ear on key issues, said Boeing has seen regulation improvements from the streamlining of defense contracting to improvements in the time it takes to get approval for foreign sales.On the defense side, Boeing has been pushing to build an upgraded F/A-18 Super Hornet to stay relevant in the defense air frame space as sales of its F-15 wind down and is in the race against Lockheed Martin (LMT) for the Air Force's T-X trainer contract.On Tuesday, Lockheed reported mixed Q1 results, and the F-35 maker lowered its full-year earnings outlook but slightly raised its revenue view. Raytheon (RTN) is scheduled to report Thursday.Northrop Grumman (NOC) and General Dynamics (GD), which both topped earnings estimates Wednesday, were little changed and up 0.9%, respectively. United Technologies (UTX), whose Pratt & Whitney unit makes jet engines, climbed 1.2% on strong Q1 results.Lockheed shares edged up 0.1% to 270.33 after falling 2.2% to 270.02 on Tuesday.

187,NOC,"Dow Jones industrial component Boeing (BA) is expected to report bigger profits, but revenue is seen falling for a third straight quarter when the aerospace giant reports Q1 results Wednesday.Earnings are seen climbing 11.5% to $1.94 while revenue slips 5.9% to $21.3 billion, marking the fourth top-line drop in the last six quarters.While announcements for new orders grab headlines and point to demand, it's actual deliveries that put money in the coffers each quarter. Earlier this month, Boeing reported Q1 commercial aircraft deliveries fell to 169 from 176 a year ago. Deliveries of 737s dropped to 113 from 121 in 2016, and 777 deliveries dipped to 21 from 23. But the 787 Dreamliner saw an increase of two to 32.Shares rose 0.8% to 183.51 on the stock market today. Boeing is closing in on a 185.81 entry from a flat base and has been finding support at its 50-day line recently. But the stock had already broken out in January and October, and investors should be cautious about late-stage bases.Boeing already announced 198 net orders for Q1, vs. 121 in the year ago quarter, roughly around the 218 Q1 average from 2012-2016, Canaccord Genuity analyst Ken Herbert wrote in a client note.The aerospace giant's ""stock is not as correlated with order activity as it has been, so we do not believe near-term order activity (or lack of) will be significant for the stock,"" Herbert wrote.Still, Boeing has lost the order race to rival Airbus (EADSY) for the last four years and has cut over 1,300 engineering jobs since January 2016.On Friday, Boeing laid off ""hundreds"" of engineering employees at its Washington state factory after offering a round of voluntary layoffs in January, and more engineering cuts could be coming depending on the ""business environment"" and voluntary attrition.Boeing could give an update on a possible new clean-sheet design for a twin-aisle midrange jet to grab market share back from rival Airbus and its A321neo jet.On the defense side, Herbert sees revenue down 8% but believes sentiment on the stock has ""improved since the election and the initial negative headlines around pricing on Air Force One,"" which President Trump had earlier blasted for being too expensive.Meanwhile, Trump has been critical of Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 over its high cost and said in February he was ""looking seriously at a big order"" of Boeing's Super Hornets.Boeing is pushing to build an upgraded F/A-18 Super Hornet to be more competitive vs. more advanced fifth generation fighters like the F-35.Northrop Grumman (NOC) and General Dynamics (GD) also report on Wednesday, and Raytheon's (RTN) results are slated for Thursday.RELATED: Lockheed Sees More F-35, Missile Defense Orders From AbroadDefense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsLockheed's F-35, F-22 May Soon Face Their Moment Of Truth
"
188,NOC,"Lockheed Martin (LMT) expects more international orders for its F-35 fighter aircraft and the company's missile-defense system, as global tensions spur demand for U.S. military hardware.But the defense giant's stock retreated to its buy point following Lockheed's first-quarter sales miss and weak earnings guidance.During Lockheed's conference call Tuesday, CEO Marillyn Hewson said that 50% of F-35 orders over the next five years will be from international customers as Lockheed sees interest from countries outside the current program of record.Partner countries on the F-35 include the U.K., Italy, the Netherlands, Japan, Turkey, Australia and Israel, among others. Last year, Lockheed said it was in talks with Spain, Belgium and Switzerland about selling them the F-35.Meanwhile, North Korea's recent missile tests are speeding up deployment of Lockheed's Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system to South Korea, and the company expects interest in THAAD from Middle Eastern customers.Raytheon's (RTN) Patriot air-defense system has also been in demand in the Mideast and Asia. After the company landed big orders from Saudi Arabia in 2015, South Korea and Japan now plan to upgrade their Patriot systems, and a contract topping $7 billion is expected soon from Poland. Lockheed makes the PAC-3 missile for the Patriot system.Lockheed has set a goal to expand its foreign sales to 30% of total revenue in the next few years, and the Trump administration has been supportive of sales to allies. A $5 billion sale of 19 Lockheed F-16 fighter jets to Bahrain was recently cleared, as U.S. allies in the region face intensifying friction with Iran.Hewson said Tuesday that Lockheed is continuing to look at opportunities to sell the F-16 abroad, especially to India, which could be a bigger buy than the Bahrain order. Shares of Lockheed fell 2.2% to 270.02 on the stock market today, trading just above and below a 270 buy point for much of the session, on mixed quarterly results and weak guidance.Northrop Grumman (NOC), which is a major F-35 subcontractor and reports Wednesday, lost 0.4% to 248.13, just below a 249.53 buy pointutx. United Technologies (UTX), which makes the F-35's engines and also reports Wednesday, rose 0.5%.Lockheed reported adjusted EPS of $3, with revenue up 6.7% to $11.1 billion. Analysts were expecting EPS of $2.79 on revenue of $11.23 billion. Aeronautics sales, which include the F-35, jumped 8% to $4.1 billion. Rotary and Mission Systems sales, which include Sikorsky, edged up 2% to $3.1 billion. Missile sales rose to $1.49 billion while Space division sales climbed 12% to $2.36 billion.The company now sees full-year EPS of $12.15 to $12.45, below the Wall Street consensus for $12.64 and down from an earlier outlook of $12.25-$12.55, and sees sales of $49.5 billion-$50.7 billion, with the midpoint slightly below consensus for $50.18 billion and up from an earlier outlook of $49.4 billion-$50.6 billion.In addition to foreign orders, Lockheed expects to reach a deal with the Pentagon for an 11th batch of F-35s, with a finalized contract expected in Q3.Lockheed started deliveries from the ninth F-35 production lot in Q1, after a $6.1 billion contract for 57 planes was signed in November. An $8.2 billion contract for the 10th batch, which covers 90 F-35s, was signed in February, though deliveries aren't expected until next year. The company is planning to transition to full-rate production in 2019.But as Lockheed looks to ramp up production, there are questions as to whether it will be able to meet its delivery goal of 66 jets this year. The Pentagon's Defense Contract Management Agency told Bloomberg that Lockheed will likely only deliver 57 F-35s this year, as it's failed to meet its contract requirements since 2014. But Lockheed insists that it will meet its target of 66.Lockheed is also working to push costs of the F-35A, the basic model ordered by the Air Force and most international partners, to under $80 million per plane in 2019 or 2020, down from $95 million currently. But Tanner said the lower cost won't negatively impact profit margins.But testing delays with the F-35 could add over $1 billion to the cost of the stealth fighter as well as postpone the Navy's timeline for declaring its version of the jet combat ready next year, according to a Government Accountability Office report out Monday. But the Pentagon offered lower estimates for cost growth and denied that there will be any impact on the Navy's or international partners' schedules to declare their variants combat ready.Lockheed is still bullish on its Sikorsky division, even though it didn't deliver a single commercial helicopter in Q1. Still, the company expects to finish the year delivering over 180 helicopters, in line with 2016 deliveries.In addition to Northrop, Boeing (BA) and General Dynamics (GD) will report Wednesday, and Raytheon is scheduled for Thursday.RELATED: Dow's Boeing Nears Buy Point Ahead Of Q1 Results, But Revenue To DropLockheed's F-35, F-22 May Soon Face Their Moment Of Truth

189,NOC,"In a very busy week for news, stocks rallied solidly. Markets worldwide cheered the results of the first round of France's presidential election. Amazon.com (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Dow stock McDonald's (MCD) hit record highs on earnings, while Intel (INTC) and Starbucks (SBUX) tumbled, with hundreds of other companies reporting. President Trump's big tax-cut plan, which had lifted markets in anticipation, didn't move the needle when its outline was finally released.The major market averages jumped Monday and Tuesday after Emmanuel Macron led the first round of voting in the French presidential election, with polls suggesting he will easily defeat nationalist Marine Le Pen in the early May runoff. Stocks largely consolidated gains the rest of the week, though individual stocks and sectors were active amid a flurry of earnings. Internet, chips, restaurants and casinos were leaders, while Baidu (BIDU), Intel and Starbucks showed that even leading groups had losers. But the Nasdaq composite hit record highs during the week, climbing 2.3%. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 1.9%, while the S&P 500 index was up 1.5%, just below all-time bests.The e-commerce giant said adjusted income rose 38% year over year to $1.48 a share, beating the consensus Q1 estimate of $1.12. Revenue rose 23% to $35.7 billion, topping views of $35.3 billion. That maintained a steady streak of double-digit revenue gains going back more than four years.Amazon Web Services, Amazon's cloud computing unit, continued to deliver huge, if gradually slowing, growth.Amazon shares rose to a record high Friday, clearing a new buy point, but closing well off intraday peaks.The earnings of Google-parent Alphabet rose 28% as revenue rose 22%, to $24.75 billion. Analysts expected the company to report earnings of $7.40 a share on sales of $24.22 billion. Revenue at Google's ""other"" non-advertising business — which includes its cloud computing unit, Pixel smartphones and the Play store — rose 49%, to $3.01 billion. Mobile advertising growth was a bright spot, although Google's rising traffic-acquisition costs are a concern. TAC refers to what Google pays partner websites to carry ads, or what it pays partners like Apple (AAPL) that generate search traffic. Alphabet shares gapped up 3.8% to a fresh record high Friday.McDonald's first-quarter results beat views, and the burger giant talked up its tech efforts, including expanding delivery, trying out mobile order and pay and its new digitized restaurant layout. Shares jumped to record highs. Domino's Pizza (DPZ) also beat and said it was testing GPS-tracking technology. Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) beat as well, and analysts debated its progress following a food-borne illness scare. Starbucks matched profit expectations, but missed on sales amid worries about stalling growth. Starbucks shares undercut a recent buy point intraday Friday, but closed above that level.Software leader Microsoft (MSFT) delivered earnings per share above views for its fiscal third quarter, but sales came in a tad short. Its sales guidance for the June quarter also was below analyst estimates. Microsoft earned 73 cents a share excluding items, up 18% year over year, on adjusted revenue of $23.56 billion, up 6%, in the March quarter. Analysts expected 70 cents and $23.62 billion. For the current quarter, Microsoft guided to sales of $24.15 billion, up 7%, but Wall Street had been modeling for $24.51 billion.Intel earnings topped, but the chip giant's sales fell shy amid weakness in its data center market, sending shares gapping down 3.5% Friday. Macom Technology Solutions (MTSI), Mellanox Technologies (MLNX), KLA-Tencor (KLAC) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) were chip plays that retreated. But Cavium (CAVM) and Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR) rallied after the chipmakers topped Q1 earnings. Gear makers Teradyne (TER) and Ultra Clean (UCTT) boomed on results.Lockheed Martin (LMT) sees more international demand for its F-35 fighter and missile-defense systems as global tensions heat up and Raytheon (RTN) sees ""significant demand signals"" for its munitions on increasing military operations in Syria. Lockheed's Q1 sales fell short of expectations and it gave weak guidance. Northrop Grumman (NOC) and General Dynamics (GD) topped on EPS and sales. All four defense stocks were in buy range at some point in the week, but by Friday's close all were slightly below entry areas.Core Boeing (BA) earnings jumped 16% to $2.01, beating views, but revenue fell 7% as defense revenue fell 18%. Free cash flow soared to $1.63 billion from $527 million. The aerospace giant raised its full year EPS outlook, but the midpoint still fell below analyst views. Industrial conglomerate United Technologies (UTX) topped with slim EPS and sales gains, as Otis elevator revenue, aerospace system sales and Pratt & Whitney jet engine sales rose.Boeing shares rose toward a flat-base buy point. United Tech is at a 23-month high, at the edge of buying range.Western Digital (WDC) and Seagate Technology (STX), the two largest providers of disk drives, had differing earnings. Seagate revenue missed estimates, with the stock falling 17% in reaction. Western Digital's earnings beat on the top and bottom lines, and announced very bullish guidance, sending shares up 3.9% Friday.Wynn Resorts (WYNN) pulled ahead of forecasts with 99 cents EPS and $1.475 billion in sales, as Macau gaming activity continues to rebound. Las Vegas Sands (LVS) EPS rose 47% to 66 cents, topping, on 15% revenue growth, meeting views. MGM Resorts (MGM) topped handily on both the top and bottom lines, helped by the takeover of the Borgata Hotel Casino and Spa and the MGM National Harbor opening. Wynn Resorts hit a two-year high, and MGM rose to its best since 2008, with shares in buy range. Sands advanced within a consolidation.Exxon Mobil (XOM) reported mixed first-quarter results but said it had no plans to adjust its capital expenditure guidance as the oil major has identified and captured capital efficiencies. Exxon warned that it still needed to be cautious on the rebalancing of the oil market. Chevron (CVX) swung to a profit in Q1 and revenue beat Wall Street estimates as overall production rose. Management said if oil remains around $50 a barrel then future spending would be near the low end of its capex forecast. U.S. oil prices are modestly below $50 a barrel as Baker Hughes announced the U.S. oil rigs in operation rose for a 15th straight week, foreshadowing further production gains.T-Mobile US (TMUS) topped Q1 earnings estimates and continued its streak of grabbing the most new subscribers among wireless operators. T-Mobile added 798,000 postpaid phone subscribers vs. 877,000 in the year-earlier period; that topped estimates of 725,000. T-Mobile shares rose to a new high, in buy range. AT&T (T) is expected to ramp up advertising for bundled wireless and pay TV offers after reporting in-line EPS and revenue that fell more than expected. AT&T lost 348,000 wireless postpaid subscribers, more than expected. Subscriber growth at DirecTV Now's streaming service helped AT&T offset surprising weakness at DirecTV's traditional pay TV business. But AT&T shares fell to 2017 low.Separately, cable giant Comcast (CMCSA) rose to a new high on strength in its movie business and broadband-customer gains.Recall costs and slowing U.S. sales hurt Ford (F) earnings, which fell but still beat Q1 views. Ford said higher commodity costs, particularly in steel, could weigh but that the worst hit to profit and costs this year likely happened in Q1. General Motors (GM) beat forecasts on solid U.S. truck and crossover sales, while Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) held its full-year outlook and kept its debt in check. The results come amid concerns about slowing auto sales, rising inventories and falling used-car prices.Dow Jones industrial average equipment-maker Caterpillar (CAT) earned $1.28 a share in Q1, more than doubling estimates, and raised its 2017 revenue range by $2 billion to $39-$41 billion, vs. estimates of $38.3 billion. Caterpillar's good news comes despite lack of progress on President Trump's infrastructure program or border wall, two initiatives that have made Caterpillar a Trump stock. Ahead of earnings, Caterpillar finally broke a 51-month streak of falling retail sales, with a 1% gain that was driven by construction equipment sales in the Asia-Pacific region. Caterpillar shares soared into a buy zone.Biotechs and drugmakers reported en masse Thursday with AbbVie (ABBV), Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) delivering across-the-board beats, pumping their stocks up that day. AstraZeneca (AZN) topped on earnings, but sales slid 12%, though adjusted profits grew 4% and topped by 17 cents. Top two biotechs, Amgen (AMGN) and Celgene (CELG), both reported lagging sales. On Thursday, Acorda Therapeutics (ACOR) stock hit an 11-year low on light sales and an 8-cent per-share loss ex items that also missed.Even as the House made another push to repeal ObamaCare — with a plan that included steep cuts for Medicaid — a raft of insurers moved into buy zones, and flirted with breakouts or pushing to new highs. The catalyst was an especially strong earnings report from Anthem (ANTM), though investors may have judged that TrumpCare remains doomed. Humana (HUM) previewed its earnings and raised guidance. Centene (CNC) topped estimates and CEO Michael Neidorff said he expects the Medicaid-heavy insurer to thrive on any reform that can be passed by Congress, noting that ""20 Republican senators come from states that expanded Medicaid.""PulteGroup (PHM) topped earnings estimates, but revenue fell short. Meanwhile, President Trump imposed a 20% tariff on Canadian softwood imports, which could raise construction costs by $1,200 per home. New-home sales rose in March to the second-fastest rate of the current business cycle. Pulte tumbled, but did not outright close below a prior buy point. D.R. Horton (DHI) and Lennar (LEN) fell below their 50-day lines as well.

190,NOC,"The U.S. military's late Thursday airstrikes on Syria lit up defense stocks including Raytheon (RTN), which makes the Tomahawk cruise missiles launched from the Mediterranean Sea.Each Tomahawk cruise missile costs over $1.5 million and the weapon was first used in the 1991 Gulf War against Iraq. Raytheon also makes the Patriot ground-based air defense system.Raytheon surged 3% before paring its gain by half, but closed above its 50-day moving average and a 152.68 flat-base buy point. That put the stock back in buy range.Among other aerospace/defense stocks, Lockheed Martin (LMT) also reclaimed a buy point as it finished 1.2% higher to just above the 270 entry. Lockheed makes the Paveway II Plus laser guided bomb. Northrop Grumman (NOC) added 0.9%, but hit resistance at its 50-day line as it builds a handle on a cup base with a 249.53 entry.Dow component Boeing (BA), which makes joint direct attack munitions kits that turn dumb bombs into smart weapons, edged 0.8% higher as it shapes a flat base with a 185.81 buy point. Of the four aerospace/defense stocks, Boeing has the highest Composite Rating of 89.The U.S. military has favored smart precision weapons that reduce the number of civilian casualties and unintended targets in the fight against the Islamic State.Aerospace was ranked No. 12 among IBD's 33 sectors ahead of Friday's bump. The sector has risen more than 5% since the start of the year. The aerospace/defense industry group, up 0.7% Friday, soared 19% from the Nov. 8 presidential election to its March 1 peak. It's still up about 14%.IBD'S TAKE: Defense stocks have been rallying since President Trump's election as he pushes for a $54 billion increase in military spending.President Trump said the missile strikes were in response to a suspected chemical weapons attack by President Bashar Assad's forces that killed at least 70 people earlier in the week.While the strikes were the first direct targeting of Assad's forces by Washington, the U.S. dropped over 12,000 bombs targeting the Islamic State and other militants in Syria last year, according to a Council on Foreign Relations report citing Defense Department data.RELATED: Lockheed Stock Hits Buy Point After Trump Reverses This Obama Move
"
191,NOC,"President Trump's budget proposal would significantly hike research funds to develop a sixth-generation fighter that follows Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35. But overall, there were few major changes in weapons procurement compared to the Obama administration's plans.The budget proposal, which also includes big tax cuts and substantial long-term curbs on Medicaid and food stamps, is seen as dead on arrival in Congress, but it still represents an opening offer from the Oval Office.The Pentagon's budget would grow to $574.5 billion in fiscal 2018, which starts in October, up 9.5% from what Congress appropriated this fiscal year. On top of that is $65 billion for the war-fighting fund, or the Overseas Contingency Operations account.Some of the increase in the Defense Department's baseline budget comes from Trump's plan to grow Army personnel by 26,000 active-duty troops. But the $115 billion for weapons procurement would largely be unchanged vs. what the Obama administration had planned for fiscal 2018.Quantities of big-ticket items like the F-35, Boeing (BA) F/A-18 Super Hornet and Boeing KC-46 tanker are the same, as well as the number of destroyers, submarines and other Navy ships.But the budget request is asking for $295 million for the Next-Generation Air Dominance Program, which would replace Boeing Super Hornets in the Navy and develop a follow-on to the F-35 in the Air Force. That's a massive increase from the prior projection of $13 million.Some $187 million also would be added to research for Lockheed's F-22, amounting to total funds of $610 million.The fiscal 2018 proposal also calls for $434 million in R&D funds for Air Force One, the aircraft that carries the president, but that amounts to a roughly $192 million reduction from the $626 million estimate for fiscal 2018.In the weeks after his election, Trump called the new Boeing Air Force One too expensive, and he has vowed to bring competition to the fighter-jet business and cut costs for the F-35, which he has said was ""way, way behind schedule and many billions of dollars above budget.""Research and development for Northrop Grumman's (NOC) B-21 bomber would get a boost to $2 billion from $1.3 billion last year.Tens of thousand of missiles, bombs and related gear from Lockheed, Raytheon (RTN) and Boeing are also in the budget plan, as the Pentagon seeks to replenish munitions stockpiles that have come down during the bombing campaign on ISIS targets.Lockheed Martin closed up 0.5% at 278.36 on the stock market today, holding above a 270 buy point. Boeing dipped 0.1% to 183.49, just below a 185.81 entry. Northrop rose 0.5% to 250.65, back above a 249.53 buy point.

192,NOC,"Flying drones drop Chipotle (CMG) burritos, 7-Eleven Slurpees and Amazon.com (AMZN) sundries on doorsteps while robots scoot down sidewalks to deliver Domino's (DPZ) pizzas and other meals to homes.These images might conjure thoughts that we've finally entered the age of mechanical gofers, or that we'll soon farm out a slew of summer jobs to robots. But hold on to your transformers for a bit.While companies such as Amazon are pushing the idea of delivery bots — the e-commerce giant now says it wants to start using them for commercial deliveries by the end of 2017 — widespread use of robotic couriers could be years away.Consumers in a few regions and limited test markets are the only ones seeing the benefits, and possible drawbacks, of machines that carry food, drinks and everyday goods to their door. And the tests are raising more questions than they're answering.For one, are these deliveries just publicity stunts designed to show consumer brands are on the cutting edge of technology? Or do they show a future where it might be practical for robots to routinely make home deliveries?""Is there a legitimate business model here? Is there a real need for this? Can I measure ROI (return on investment)? Those are the questions that need to be answered,"" ABI Research analyst Dan Kara told Investor's Business Daily.It's not clear right now that a robot can handle deliveries as fast or better than a human. Further, the long-term costs of developing and deploying bot couriers is unclear. Plus, companies have yet to figure out how to protect that mechanical merchandise.In other words, it could be some time before you'll see robot-delivered pizza on a grand scale. For now, delivery bots are very much an experiment, with companies and consumers in a dot-com-esque honeymoon phase. Some companies are dreaming big, and harsh reality has yet to set in.Amazon got the public excited about the idea of aerial delivery drones when it announced its Prime Air initiative in December 2013. It wasn't until this past March that it conducted its first drone delivery in the U.S., transporting a bottle of sunscreen to a resort in Palm Springs, Calif., during a tech conference.Still, Amazon is sticking to its vision, and hopes to deliver small packages of up to 5 pounds in 30 minutes or less by drones that can fly up to 50 miles per hour.Retail behemoth Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) has expressed interest in making drone deliveries as has Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL). Google has a drone delivery initiative called Project Wing that is looking to develop automated aircraft to deliver everything from consumer goods to emergency medicine. Last September, Project Wing conducted a test on the Virginia Tech campus, delivering Chipotle burritos by air to students and employees.The movement has prompted delivery specialists, such as FedEx (FDX) and United Parcel Service (UPS), to evaluate their options. Self-driving trucks eventually are expected to deploy small robots to deliver packages to your door. But aerial drones are considered a better solution for greater distances, especially in rural and hard-to-reach places.Gartner analyst Gerald Van Hoy believes that commercial drone deliveries in the U.S. are a few years away, but within sight. Business-to-business drone deliveries might help pave the way for consumer deliveries, Van Hoy told IBD. It is easy to calculate the payback of sending a drone to deliver a tool to a worker in the field vs. sending a human driver, he said.By the same token, business uses of wheeled delivery robots could lead to consumer applications as the technology improves and the value proposition becomes clear, ABI's Kara said.Venture capital firms and corporations are funding robotic delivery initiatives on the chance that they could become a huge deal. But that might not happen, Kara said, noting that many millions of dollars were invested in corporate telepresence robots — sort of interoffice gofers — before that market fizzled.Analysts point out robotic delivery systems could help restaurants that struggle to find enough delivery workers. They also could be a hedge against rising employee costs, especially with the Fight For $15 political movement to raise the minimum wage.Ultimately, there will be questions on regulatory restrictions and finding the right business model. Tech companies and government regulators are working out how best to allow delivery robots in the public air space and on streets and walkways. The biggest questions are business-related, and whether delivery bots are economically feasible, Kara said.A raft of companies have developed robotics, including Google, Northrop Grumman (NOC) and Roomba maker iRobot (IRBT). A few private companies, however, have come to the forefront when it comes to delivery bots.They include two startups, Marble and Starship Technologies, two private robotic firms. In April, Yelp's (YELP) Eat24 food delivery service partnered with Marble to test robotic deliveries with a handful of restaurants in a couple San Francisco neighborhoods.The Eat24-branded robots are the size of a shopping cart. They navigate city sidewalks with artificial intelligence, cameras, ultrasonic sensors and light detection, or lidar, sensors. Typical deliveries are within a mile. Customers are sent a four-digit code to open the four-wheeled robot's storage compartment.Rival delivery robot firm Starship started making food deliveries in Silicon Valley in March. Starship also has conducted trials in Austin, Texas; Portland, Ore.; and Washington, D.C., as well as a dozen European countries.Starship robots are roughly the size of large picnic coolers and have six wheels. In March, Starship announced a deal with Domino's to deliver pizzas by robot within a one-mile radius around its outlets in select German and Dutch cities.While sidewalk robots are seen as the best solution for short-distance deliveries in cities, some politicians don't like the idea.In May, San Francisco Supervisor Norman Yee introduced legislation that would ban autonomous delivery robots from city sidewalks, largely for safety concerns. Those concerns range from machines getting in the way of cars and pedestrians to lawbreakers stealing or vandalizing them.On the other side of the coin, humanitarian concerns are a consideration.Last September, UPS partnered with drone maker CyPhy Works to test the use of drones to make commercial deliveries of packages to remote locations. The companies staged a mock delivery of urgently needed medicine from Beverly, Mass., to Children's Island, about three miles off the Atlantic coast. In the mock scenario, the drone successfully carried an asthma inhaler to a child at a camp on the island.Zipline International is using fixed-wing drones to deliver medical products, such as blood products and rabies treatments, to remote locations. It currently is serving 21 hospitals in Rwanda. Its drones can deliver to any site within about 47 miles, or 93 miles round-trip. As of November, Zipline had raised $43 million in funding.""The humanitarian side of drone deliveries is starting to be talked about a lot more,"" Gretchen West, co-executive director of the Commercial Drone Alliance, told IBD. ""It's delivering medicine, aid and supplies after a catastrophe or to remote locations where roads could be washed out. We're starting to see a lot more of that, not just consumer delivery.""Already, several companies are making headway deploying robots to deliver items in structured environments like hospitals and hotels, he said. Pittsburgh-based Aethon makes delivery robots for hospitals to ferry food, medicine, towels and other items. San Jose, Calif.-based Savioke makes robots for delivering items to consumers in hotels and high-rise buildings.West says drone deliveries to consumers will happen, but will take longer for the puzzle pieces to come together. Right now, commercial drones in the U.S. face strict limitations.For instance, they can't fly over people, must be operated within visual line of sight, and can't fly at night. Many of these problems will be solved by an unmanned aircraft system traffic management system under development by NASA, she said.""It will take several years,"" West said. ""None of this moves very quickly.""

193,NOC,"Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 flew alongside older fighters from the U.S. and allied forces during its recent European deployment, providing the Air Force with new lessons on how the stealth jet can be supported and integrated with other forces.Pentagon officials envision ""fifth-generation"" F-35s and F-22s entering a battle space first to suppress any airborne or air-defense threats, allowing older, but more heavily armed ""fourth-generation"" fighters to follow.X Eight Air Force F-35A variants from the 34th Fighter Squadron deployed to RAF Lakenheath in the U.K. in April and were later sent to Estonia and Bulgaria as a show of force in the region and to test the procedures and logistics of moving the F-35 around the area.While the F-35 didn't fly with any Bulgarian or Estonian aircraft, they did train with U.S. Boeing (BA) F-15s stationed at Lakenheath and flew with British, Dutch and Norwegian Lockheed F-16s.The last of the F-35s returned to the U.S. on May 9, and officials from Hill Air Force Base offered more details Wednesday about the plane's first deployment to Europe.""We continue to learn again and again that the 5th gen is making our 4th gen more survivable, and the 4th gen makes us more lethal or deadly with their fire power,"" Lt. Col. George Watkins, the 34th Fighter Squadron commander, told reporters during a briefing.Here are some other takeaways:Lockheed shares were down 0.8% at 269.51 in late-afternoon trading on the stock market today, dipping below their 270 buy point amid a broad sell-off. United Technologies, whose Pratt & Whitney unit makes the plane's engines, dropped 1.6%, re-entering the high end of its buy zone. Northrop, a major F-35 subcontractor, dipped 0.1% to 247.18 but still near a 249.53 entry.As tensions heat up in the region, Germany could be the next NATO ally to buy the F-35 outside current NATO partner countries like the U.K., the Netherlands, Norway, Turkey and Italy.According to a Reuters report Wednesday, the German air force requested classified data on the F-35 as it looks to start replacing its older fourth-generation jets between 2025 and 2035. There are no plans yet for a procurement program from Berlin.The F-35 will attend the Paris Air Show next month, but Lockheed, not the Air Force, will get the plane over to the show.RELATED:The Brains For Lockheed's F-35 Just Got SmarterLockheed's F-35, F-22 May Soon Face Their Moment Of Truth

194,NOC,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 flew close to the Russia border last month as a show of force, but Pentagon officials said Monday they aren't concerned about adversaries obtaining any intelligence about it during the stealth fighter's public display.Several of the Air Force's F-35A variants were deployed to RAF Lakenheath in the U.K. in April and were later sent to Estonia, which borders Russia, and Bulgaria, which is across the Black Sea from Russian forces in Crimea, as part of the European Reassurance Initiative, a program for placing U.S. forces in the region that began after Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimea.When asked about security issues related to flying the F-35 so close to Russia, Pleus said that while pilots are always nervous about adversaries gleaning information from the plane, the Pentagon has ""procedures available"" to prevent that from happening.""We have in place through a partner of networks proper procedures for us to make sure we can fly the airplane when we want to, in places that we want to, and that people cannot collect information off of the F-35,"" Brig. Gen. Scott L. Pleus, director at the F-35 Integration Office, told a group of reporters Monday.He wouldn't go into the types of procedures, saying they were classified. The last of the F-35s returned to the U.S. on May 9, and officials from Hill Air Force Base are scheduled to give more details Wednesday about its first deployment to Europe.Lockheed shares closed 0.4% higher at 272.36 on the stock market today. United Technologies (UTX), whose Pratt & Whitney unit makes the plane's engines, edged up 0.1%. Northrop Grumman (NOC), which is a major F-35 subcontractor, added 0.3%.Meanwhile, a critical F-35 system performed without a hitch in Europe.The Autonomic Logistics Information System — which Lockheed calls ""the IT backbone of the F-35"" that integrates preventive maintenance, flight scheduling and the mission planning system — had some serious issues during development and the system was flagged as a major flaw in a Government Accountability Office report last year.But Pleus said he had ""heard of no problems at all with ALIS.""The ALIS version 2.0.2 update, which integrates key engine information into the system, was recently approved for deployment to the F-35 fleet.RELATED: Defense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsLockheed's F-35, F-22 May Soon Face Their Moment Of Truth

196,NOC,"The capabilities in Boeing's (BA) bid for the Air Force's trainer jet program are ""more robust"" than Lockheed Martin's (LMT) offering, an analyst says, but affordability will likely play a ""heavy hand"" in the Pentagon's decision.The race between the two top contractors is too close to call, as both ""aircraft meet, if not exceed the bid specifications, with the capabilities of the Boeing aircraft somewhat more robust than those of (Lockheed's) T-50A,"" Moody's analyst Jonathan Root said in a note to clients late Wednesday.""We believe (Boeing's) all-digital cockpit has great flexibility from a trainer standpoint. It can pull up cockpits from the Raptor and F-35,"" Root said in an interview with Investor's Business Daily.Root said it was unclear if Lockheed's offering had a digital cockpit or if its cockpit has the flexibility to fully become another plane like the F-22 or F-35.Lockheed's operational T-50A, along with Boeing and partner Saab's clean sheet T-X bid, are the clear front-runners in the contest that saw early leader Northrop Grumman (NOC) drop out and Raytheon (RTN) end its bid with Italy's Leonardo earlier this year. Leonardo has since decided to enter a bid on its own, and Sierra Nevada along with Turkish Aerospace Industries are submitting their ""Freedom Trainer"" option.Boeing shares ticked up 0.2% to 177.37 at the close on the stock market today. Lockheed was up marginally to 267.11. Raytheon ticked up 0.5% to 150.75. Northrop shares ticked up 0.2% to 236.67.IBD'S TAKE: Defense stocks have been flying high after President Trump vowed to expand military spending, and Boeing could get another boost from Trump's proposed border tax.While Boeing might have new capabilities on its side, Lockheed's offering has been flying successfully in South Korea since 2002, and last month Lockheed executives told reporters that the T-50A could be delivered to the Air Force in 2022, two years ahead of schedule.But Boeing is expected to push hard for its clean sheet design as it looks to stay in the defense airframe business after losing contests for the F-35 and the B-21 bomber.""They are two very viable contestants and both will do the job. It's going to come down to these two issues — affordability and the desire to have a more diversified vendor base,"" Root said.The contract, estimated at $16 billion for the initial 350 aircraft, will be awarded later this year.RELATED: Air Force Will Seek Proposals For Low-Cost Attack Plane ExperimentBoeing's Super Hornet And Lockheed's F-35: Wingmates Or Rivals?

197,NOC,"XFutures for the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite signaled modest gains early Tuesday as the major market averages look set to hold and extend Monday's big gains.Dow components McDonald's (MCD) and Caterpillar (CAT) report earnings before the open, along with Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Pulte Group (PHM). All are in buy range as of Monday's close except for Caterpillar, which took a big step Monday toward its own entry point.Meanwhile, look for Express Scripts (ESRX) to sell off at Tuesday's open on bad news. Express Scripts announced that it was likely to lose its top customer, Anthem (ANTM), sending shares of the pharmacy benefit manager down 15% late Monday. (CVS Health (CVS), which is a major PBM in addition to its drugstore operations, was up 3% late, perhaps on hopes that it will win the Anthem business.)On Monday, the Nasdaq composite soared 1.2%, hitting an all-time high.

Analysts expect a 6% sales decline, to $5.53 billion, with earnings per share up 8%, to $1.33. U.S. same-store sales will be watched closely.Beyond Q1 results and guidance, analysts will look for McDonald's clues about when it will roll out its mobile order-and-pay system, as well as any further talk of deliveries. Investors also will want to know how McDonald's big McCafe promotions are working, which could impact Starbucks (SBUX). Starbucks has broken out of its own consolidation ahead of earnings on Thursday.Analysts expect the maker of heavy construction and mining equipment to report a 7.5% EPS decline, to 62 cents, with sales off 2%, to $9.27 billion. On Monday, Caterpillar reported that equipment sales by retailers rose 1% in the three months to March vs. a year earlier, the first such gain since November 2012.Caterpillar shares rose 2.6%, to 96.81, on Monday, retaking their 50-day line and approaching a 99.56 flat-base buy point.The defense contractor should report an 8% revenue rise to $1.24 billion with EPS also up 8%, to $2.79. Lockheed Martin rose 1.1%, to 276.21, on Monday, still in range from a 270 buy point retaken last week.Defense stocks have rallied on hopes for higher U.S. military spending and increased geopolitical tensions with Syria and North Korea. Raytheon (RTN), Northrop Grumman (NOC), General Dynamics (GD) as well as Boeing (BA) report later this week. All of those stocks are in or near buy points as well.The homebuilder is expected to report a 21% EPS rise to 29 cents on a 22% revenue rise.

199,NOC,"Acting South Korean President Hwang Kyo Ahn and U.S. Vice President Michael Pence said Monday that Seoul will deploy Lockheed Martin's (LMT) Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) ahead of schedule as tensions with North Korea ramp up.The announcement follows key developments over the weekend related to the communist regime's missile program. A test of what some officials believe was a medium-range missile failed, but an earlier military parade in Pyongyang appeared to show off new types of long-range missiles.""North Korea would do well not to test his resolve,"" Pence said of President Trump in a joint news conference during the vice president's visit to South Korea, ""or the strength of the armed forces of the United States in this region.""THAAD's deployment, which is controversial in South Korea and is opposed by China and Russia, was originally scheduled for later this year. But components started to arrive in March following prior missile tests in North Korea. Neither Pence nor Hwang gave a specific timeline Monday for its accelerated deployment.The decision to deploy THAAD was made last year under President Obama and South Korea's then-President Park Geun-hye, who has since resigned and was formally indicted Monday over an influence-peddling scandal.Meanwhile, Japan is looking to update its missile defense system.

Northrop Grumman (NOC) shares were up 1.2% to 243.10. Boeing (BA) shares climbed 1.9% to 179.02, rebounding from their 50-day line.IBD'S TAKE: Defense stocks have been on the rise since President Trump took office on promises to expand the military's budget. Many top stocks are forming bases and bouncing in and out of buy range. But the policy in Seoul on North Korea could be reversed under a new administration. A presidential election to replace Park will be held by May 9.The South Korean Democratic Party's Moon Jae-in is leading the polls, and the former human rights lawyer has taken a less hawkish stance on Pyongyang.RELATED: Lockheed Stock Hits Buy Point After Trump Reverses This Obama MoveBoeing's Super Hornet And Lockheed's F-35: Wingmates Or Rivals?

200,NOC,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — A top Air Force acquisition official said contract requirements for Northrop Grumman's (NOC) B-21 won't be changing, but the stealth bomber is being designed to make room for future modifications.
"
201,NOC,"The program's current requirements were locked down to keep costs under control, said Lt. Gen. Arnold Bunch, military deputy in Air Force acquisition, noting that decades ago Northrop's B-2 stealth bomber had its requirements rewritten after the contract was awarded and suffered cost overruns due to redesigns.""That's why holding the requirements so stable is critical to us,"" Bunch said at a Senate Armed Services subcommittee hearing late Wednesday.Still, the B-21 is being built with a software interface that would allow the Air Force to ""advance technology as it evolves or we can make changes as our adversaries evolve,"" he added, noting that it will have additional power, electrical, air conditioning and space capacity in key areas.IBD'S TAKE: Northrop Grumman retook its 50-day moving average Thursday as it works its way through a cup-with-handle base with a 249.53 buy point. But the stock's Relative Strength line has been falling, signaling that the defense contractor has been lagging the overall S&P 500 index in recent months.""If we need to add something to it, we've got areas that we can do that,"" Bunch said. ""If we need to change out a component, if it ties into the open systems architecture, we can do that.""He also said the Air Force will ""keep competition in the platform for the life of the platform,"" hinting that follow-on enhancements would require competitive bids to save costs vs. relying on sole-source agreements.Northrop shares climbed 1.1% to 239.06 on the stock market today.Northrop beat out a Boeing (BA)-Lockheed Martin (LMT) team for the B-21 contract in 2015.The B-21's price tag has been a sensitive subject as other Pentagon program's like Lockheed's F-35 face additional scrutiny for rising costs and delays.The Air Force has put the bomber's development cost at $23.5 billion and the per-plane cost at $564 million in 2016 dollars. But it hasn't given an estimate for the total acquisition cost, saying U.S. adversaries could infer the plane's capabilities with such figures. Meanwhile, analysts have put the total acquisition cost at up to $80 billion.Senate Armed Services Chairman John McCain, R-Ariz., has been critical of the program's secrecy, especially regarding its cost, as taxpayers are on the hook for any overruns under Northrop's cost-plus contract.Bunch promised senators at the hearing that the Air Force is ""committed to complete transparency with the appropriately cleared individuals of the defense committees"" and is balancing what it can give out to the public with the need for security.RELATED: Trump Waives Human Rights Condition On F-16 Jet Sale to BahrainWhat The Air Force Chief Said In His 5 Minutes With Trump

The Navy plans to issue a formal request for proposals sometime this summer and award a contract in 2018.Shares of Lockheed shares closed up 0.2% on the stock market today. Boeing and Northrop rose 0.6%.The Navy had initially envisioned a drone that would take off from and land on aircraft carriers for deep-strike missions. Surveillance requirements were later added to the strike function.But last year, the Pentagon ordered the Navy to convert the program and instead develop a drone that can carry out unmanned aerial refueling.Weiss said Tuesday the tanker drone will provide more reach for Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornets and Lockheed F-35s that current tankers can't enable.But even though the Pentagon scaled back the drone's mission, Weiss said Chief of Naval Operations Adm.

"
205,NOC,"ARLINGTON, Va. — Lockheed Martin (LMT) could submit its T-50A aircraft for an Air Force experiment this year on low-cost planes, an executive said Tuesday, while touting its potential in the trainer aircraft market both in the U.S. and overseas.The Air Force will fly selected aircraft this summer at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico to see if they could be used against targets that lack significant air defenses, sparing more sophisticated fighters like Boeing's (BA) F/A-18 Super Hornet and Lockheed's F-35 and reducing operating costs.But Rob Weiss, Lockheed's executive vice president for Advanced Development Programs, said the company still needs to determine if the T-50A can meet the Air Force's requirements on the fuel-burn rate and ability to take off from an austere runway.Meanwhile, the Air Force is also holding a competition to build a new trainer aircraft.Lockheed and partner Korea Aerospace Industries are using an existing off-the-shelf design for the T-50A offering, and Weiss said it could be delivered to the Air Force in 2022, two years ahead of schedule.The T-50A is the ""most affordable alternative and the only alternative in our view that can be delivered on time,"" he told reporters at Lockheed's annual media day.Boeing and partner Saab are developing a competing, clean-sheet trainer design, something Weiss said Lockheed decided against two years ago because it wouldn't be ready by the targeted 2024 initial operational capability date.Lockheed shares closed down 1.1% at 269 on the stock market today amid a broad market sell-off, dipping below buy range after breaking out last week. Boeing retreated 1.9%.Analysts have said Lockheed is the likely front-runner in the trainer contest, after Northrop Grumman (NOC) and Raytheon (RTN) bowed out of the competition for the $16.3 billion, 350-aircraft contract.But even if Lockheed loses the U.S. Air Force's contest, Weiss said the T-50A offering also has potential in overseas markets, estimating that the total worldwide market could be 1,000-2,000 aircraft, including the 350 planes the Air Force plans to buy.RELATED: Lockheed Not Bothered By Trump's Call With Boeing CEO, F-35 Chief

208,NOC,"A blowout private-payroll report from ADP and rebounding oil prices initially helped put the major U.S. stock indexes on pace for weekly gains. A strong start from the tech sector, led by Tesla (TSLA), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL) and its suppliers also helped send the Nasdaq to fresh record highs.But that all changed with the minutes from the Federal Reserve's March meeting, as policymakers signaled a surprise tilt toward more monetary tightening. Signs of disarray in Washington, D.C., on the effort to overhaul taxes also weighed on markets. Official U.S. jobs data showing conflicting signals Friday failed to bolster the market, nor did a strong IPO from tech company Okta. The Dow Jones industrial average closed about flat  for the week, while the S&P 500 was down 0.3% and the Nasdaq was off 0.6%.The Labor Department's March payroll report showed a gain of just 98,000 jobs, barely over half of what analysts expected, and January's and February's gains were revised lower. But the unemployment rate fell to a 10-year low of 4.5% as a separate survey found a robust jump in employment. Much of the weakness in payrolls was blamed on unseasonable weather. Underlying trends could be stronger. ADP's private-sector hiring report earlier in the week put March's jobs gain at 263,000. The overall direction of jobs, wages and inflation is seen putting pressure on the Fed to tighten monetary policy.RELATED:Minutes of the Federal Reserve's March 14-15 meeting released Wednesday afternoon revealed that policymakers are ready to start shrinking the central bank's $4.5 trillion balance sheet later this year.The move, which amounts to a tightening of monetary policy, would begin to reverse the accommodation from the Fed's unconventional asset-buying programs launched in late 2008 to combat the financial crisis.The revelation helped turn a solid stock market advance into a small loss. Some analysts suggested that the Fed's policy signal could mean an unexpected rate hike in September, following a widely expected one in June. That would allow the Fed to start reducing the size of its balance sheet in December by no longer reinvesting all of the principal returned when its bond holdings mature.Separately, Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Richmond regional Fed bank, abruptly resigned after admitting that he violated the Fed's confidentiality rules in 2012 by speaking with a financial analyst about policy deliberations.RELATED:Okta (OKTA) raised $187 million late Thursday, pricing 11 million shares at 17, the high end of its estimated range. The stock climbed 38% over its IPO price to close at 23.51 on the Nasdaq Friday. That price values the company at over $2 billion. Okta's Identity Cloud platform provides identity management services for businesses. The San Francisco-based company is the fourth new company worth more than $1 billion to come public this year, following the successful IPOs of MuleSoft (MULE) Presidio (PSDO) and Snap (SNAP).RELATED:Tesla stock soared to a record high, following its Sunday report on car deliveries that beat expectations. Tesla now has a higher market valuation than Ford (F), which sold off Monday on weak U.S. auto sales for March. CEO Elon Musk mocked Tesla short sellers in a Monday tweet. Tesla delivered just over 25,000 vehicles in the first quarter, above its target of 23,000-24,500 vehicles and above Wall Street estimates for about 24,200.RELATED:Panera Bread (PNRA) agreed to be bought by Luxembourg's JAB for $7.5 billion including debt, or $315 per share. The deal is expected to close in the third quarter. JAB also owns Caribou Coffee, Krispy Kreme Doughnuts, Keurig Green Mountain and Peet's Coffee & Tea. It's the fourth major restaurant acquisition this year following Restaurant Brands' (QSR) purchase of Popeyes, Golden Gate Capital's buyout of Bob Evans Farms and Darden Restaurants (DRI) buying Cheddars. Other transactions could be on the horizon given analysts' forecasts for restaurant traffic to remain under pressure this year as consumers opt to save money and eat at home.RELATED:Google continued introducing remedies to quash an advertising crisis at YouTube that derailed a rally in parent Alphabet's (GOOGL) stock in mid-March. Google introduced a new system that lets outside firms verify ad quality standards on its video service. The advertising uproar began in Europe when major brands complained about ad placement next to videos that promoted hate, violence and racism. Analysts say some advertisers that have suspended ads on YouTube are seeking concessions from Google, aside from resolving the ad placement issue. YouTube, meanwhile, launched a $35 monthly TV streaming service in five U.S. markets — New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago and Philadelphia.Meanwhile, Amazon's video business rolled ahead. It won rights to stream 10 National Football League games this fall — taking the ball from Twitter (TWTR), which held the same rights last year. Amazon is paying a big price for the privilege. It's paying $50 million, which is $40 million more than Twitter paid. The games will be available to members of Amazon Prime.RELATED:India is the first target of Twitter's new version, which the microblog service described as ""a new mobile web experience which minimizes data usage, loads quickly on slower connections, is resilient on unreliable mobile networks, and takes up less than 1MB on your device."" Twitter hopes the new mobile-friendly services will topple barriers to usage in countries where networks are slow, data service plans are pricey for much of the population, or mobile devices tend to lack storage. It sees potential in the Asia Pacific region, Latin America and Africa.RELATED:The FDA sent the company a complete response letter after Merck (MRK) said it wanted to include data from a trial evaluating cardiovascular outcomes with sitagliptin — the chemical name for diabetes drugs Januvia and Janumet — in the prescribing information of sitagliptin-containing medicines. A complete response letter is issued when an application is rejected. It means Merck still has some work to do to get approval for including cardiovascular outcomes data on the labels for Januvia, Janumet and Janumet XR. Merck said it is exploring its options.

209,NOC,"ARLINGTON, Va. — The Air Force will formally seek proposals Friday for aircraft that would fly in a low-cost attack plane experiment, with Texton (TXT,) Northrop Grumman (NOC), Boeing (BA) and Embraer (ERJ) seen as potential participants.Responses from industry are expected within a month, with the selected aircraft flying in tests this summer at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico, said Lt. Gen. Arnold Bunch, military deputy in Air Force acquisition, at an Air Force Association breakfast Thursday.The Pentagon has debated the idea for a light-attack aircraft for some time and even deployed Vietnam-era propeller-driven planes to Iraq in 2015 to see how they performed against the Islamic State, which lack sophisticated air defenses.The idea is to reduce wear and tear on more advanced fighters and cut operating expenses. Aircraft like Lockheed's F-35 and Boeing's F/A-18 Super Hornet would still form the backbone of the U.S. fighter fleet for missions in so-called contested environments and against sophisticated planes from China and Russia.""We want to look at a concept to see if we can have a lower operating cost, a lower unit cost and for something that would be able to operate in a permissive or more permissive environment than what I would require a fourth- or fifth-gen aircraft to operate in,"" Bunch said.Textron could submit its AirLand Scorpion, after dropping the plane out of the running for the Air Force's T-X trainer plane contest, or its Beechcraft AT-6 aircraft. After also dropping out of the T-X program, Northrop could propose the plane once envisioned for that contract, according to Mark Bobbi, an aerospace, defense and security analyst at consultancy IHS.Meanwhile, Boeing and Saab could submit their joint T-X proposal, and Brazil's Embraer could submit its A-29 Super Tucano.""No one who has developed a trainer in the last 40 years has done it solely for the trainer market,"" Bobbi said, noting the Pilatus of Switzerland as one exception.Northrop shares fell 1.5% to 240.28 on the stock market today. Boeing dipped 0.3% to 178.19. Embraer's U.S.-listed shares climbed 1.4% to 243.96. Textron fell 0.4% to 47.65.In announcing plans for the experiment, acting Air Force Secretary Lisa Disbrow said earlier this month the Air Force needs to ""explore off-the-shelf technologies"" to curb costs as the service faces budget and workforce constraints.The price tag for buying the Super Tucano, for example, would be more than $10 million, or about a tenth the current cost of Lockheed's F-35. Operating the Super Tucano would only cost a few thousand dollars per hour vs. $19,000 per hour for Lockheed's F-16 and $44,000 for the F-35A variant, according to Air Force data cited by the Washington Post.Bunch stressed Thursday that what is now designated as the OA-X experiment is not an official acquisition program and could be scrapped if submissions aren't as mature as the Air Force wants.And even if the Pentagon did decide to buy new, low-cost attack planes, they wouldn't come at the expense of modernization efforts for fifth-generation fighters.""Moving in this direction would be additive for what the Air force has for dollars and manpower for today,"" Bunch said.Potentially tripping up the Air Force's efforts is the Army's program to replace its helicopters, including Boeing Apaches, which could be sped up to fly in the mid to late-2020s from the current plan for 2030, said IHS analyst Bobbi.""If the Army accelerates (the Future Vertical Lift program), the whole argument for the fixed-wing light strike goes away,"" he told IBD. ""That's the wild card in the game.""

210,NOC,"Saudi Arabia has reportedly reached a deal to buy four Lockheed Martin (LMT) Littoral Combat Ships for $6 billion, as part of a $100 billion arms package that is expected to be finalized during President Trump's visit to the Middle East ally.The deal is expected to be announced Saturday, according to Bloomberg, when President Trump arrives in Riyadh. The ships had already been approved by the State Department in 2015 but the deal wasn't completed under President Obama.X A flurry of deals across the defense and energy sectors are expected during Trump's first presidential visit abroad.Lockheed's Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile system, which costs roughly $1 billion, is expected to be part of a massive $100 billion defense package as well as software for command and control capabilities and satellite communications systems, also from Lockheed.Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner reportedly helped push the THAAD deal though by calling Lockheed's CEO Marillyn Hewson and asking her to lower the price for the Saudis, according to the New York Times.And a formal agreement for more Pac-3 Patriot missiles from Lockheed is expected as it has already been approved by Congress.Raytheon (RTN) is another big defense winner as Trump is expected to lift the Obama administration's hold on a $1 billion sale of  Penetrator Warheads and Paveway laser-guided bombs.An order for 115 M1A2 General Dynamics (GD) tanks is expected to be finalized during the visit as well.Lockheed shares rose 2% to 272.76 on the stock market today, retaking a 270 buy point. Raytheon climbed 1.5%, still in buying territory. General Dynamics advanced 1.7%, also retaking its own 194.10 entry. Northrop Grumman (NOC) rallied 1.2% to 249.84, closing above a 249.53 entry for the first time, though volume is low.On the energy side, General Electric (GE), Schlumberger (SLB), Baker Hughes (BHI) and Halliburton (HAL) are expected to announce deals with Saudi Aramco, Saudi Arabia's state run oil company, according to an earlier Bloomberg report.Senior executives from Boeing (BA), Exxon Mobil (XOM), Morgan Stanley (MS) and 42 other companies are expected in Riyadh.

212,NOC,"Lockheed Martin (LMT) kicks off a busy week of defense earnings Tuesday as tensions rise in the Middle East and Asia.Analysts see an 8% increase in earnings to $2.79 per share, and revenue is seen rising 8.4% to $1.24 billion as F-35 production continues to ramp up.Deliveries from the ninth F-35 production lot began in Q1, after a $6.1 billion contract for 57 planes was signed in November. An $8.2 billion contract for the 10th batch, which covers 90 F-35s, was signed in February, though deliveries aren't expected until next year. Lockheed is planning to transition to full-rate production in 2019.Meanwhile, North Korea's recent missile tests are speeding up deployment of Lockheed's Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system to South Korea, highlighting the growing demand for air-defense systems.In the Middle East, the $5 billion sale of 19 Lockheed F-16 fighter jets to Bahrain was recently cleared as U.S. allies in the region face intensifying friction with Iran. Lockheed has set a goal to expand its foreign sales to 30% of total revenue in the next few years and the Trump administration has been supportive of sales to allies.Shares of Lockheed are back in buy range after clearing a 270 entry several times since late February. Shares rose 1.2% to 276.33 in the stock market today.Raytheon (RTN) reports Thursday. Analysts expect a 12.6% jump in EPS to $1.62 and a 1.2% increase in revenue to $5.83 billion.The Tomahawk maker's stock saw a bump after its cruise missiles were launched at a Syrian air base earlier this month. Each Tomahawk cruise missile costs over $1.5 million.Raytheon's Patriot air-defense system has also been in demand. After land big orders from Saudi Arabia in 2015, South Korea and Japan plan to upgrade their Patriot systems, and a contract topping $7 billion is expected soon from Poland.Shares are also back in buy range after clearing a 152.68 buy point initially last month. Rathyeon rose 1.3% to 156.02 on Monday.IBD'S TAKE: Lockheed and Raytheon retook their buy points of 270 and 152.68 respectively, but did so in light volume.

213,NOC,"Raytheon (RTN) said Thursday that heightened military operations in Syria are lifting the demand outlook for munitions, while more countries in Europe look to acquire its Patriot air-defense system.Shares of Raytheon got a boost after its Tomahawk cruise missiles were launched at a Syrian air base earlier this month. Each Tomahawk cruise missile costs over $1.5 million.When asked during a conference call about prospects for a no-fly zone in Syria, Chairman and CEO Thomas Kennedy said the ""tempo in Syria is pretty up right now,"" and the company is ""seeing significant demand signals to provide solutions and keep up with replenishment requirements.""Meanwhile, Poland is in contract negotiations with the U.S. government for Raytheon's Patriot system, and the deal, once closed, will net the company more than $4 billion.Also during the call, an analyst suggested that Romania is one of two other European countries considering the Patriot. Kennedy acknowledged that other countries in Europe are interested but declined to name them, saying only, ""We are obviously working with the U.S. government to expedite those as fast as possible.""On Tuesday, Lockheed Martin (LMT) said it expects more missile defense orders from allies abroad.Shares of Raytheon were up 0.6% at 156.26 on the stock market today, paring gains and dipping back below its 157.69 buy point after clearing that threshold earlier in the day. Northrop Grumman (NOC) was up 0.1% at 248.40, also retreating from an entry point. General Dynamics (GD) added 0.1% to 195.03, still in a buy range, while Lockheed edged up 0.3%, also still in buy range.Raytheon's Q1 earnings from continuing operations jumped 21% to $1.173 a share, well above analyst views for $1.61 billion. Revenue rose 3.4% to $6 billion, also beating Wall Street views for $5.83 billion.Missile sales were up 2% to $1.76 billion. Sales of integrated defense systems, which include the Patriot, rose 5% to $1.4 billion, led by an early-warning radar. Sales of space and airborne systems climbed 8% to $1.6 billion, led by electronic warfare systems. Backlog at the end of the quarter was up 5.5% to $36.1 billion.Raytheon also lifted its guidance and now sees full-year EPS of $7.25 to $7.40, up from an earlier outlook of $7.20 to $7.35 but still largely below consensus of $7.40. It also expects full-year sales of $24.9 billion to $25.4 billion, up from a prior guidance of $24.8 billion to $25.3 billion and with the new midpoint above Wall Street views for $25.09 billion.While Raytheon's international bookings were up 14% in Q1, and international programs made up 41% of the backlog, it's also pursuing U.S. contracts and plans to compete for the Pentagon's Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD) — an intercontinental ballistic missile program to replace Boeing's (BA) aging Minuteman missiles.Kennedy said Raytheon hasn't yet decided which contractor it will team up with for GBSD, which has an estimated cost of $62 billion over 30 years. The Air Force is expected to award preliminary contracts to bidders this year then narrow down to one prime contractor in 2020.

217,NOC,"The Trump administration is set to unveil a budget proposal in the coming week that will offer additional details about defense spending, making Lockheed Martin (LMT), Northrop Grumman (NOC), United Technologies (UTX), General Dynamics (GD) and Dow Jones industrial average component Boeing (BA) stocks to watch.The budget plan, which could be released Thursday, follows a broad outline last month that called for a $54 billion hike in defense spending but didn't specify what programs would benefit. It also didn't say how dollars would be split between new weapons, which would help the Lockheed Martins of the world, and personnel costs like uniforms, medical care and housing.During his campaign, Trump called for adding 78 ships to the Navy, at least 100 aircraft to the Air Force, and tens of thousands of troops to the Army and Marines. He has also backed efforts to recapitalize the U.S. nuclear arsenal, as Boeing, Lockheed, Northrop, Raytheon (RTN) and other defense contractors turn their sights to nuclear missile contracts that could be worth more than $90 billion.Lockheed Martin — which makes the F-35 stealth fighter jet, Sikorsky helicopters, missiles, and the littoral combat ship — has been trying to clear a cup base with a 270 buy point. Shares ended Friday at 268.66.The Pentagon's top supplier has taken some flak recently. Trump has said he wants to introduce competition into the business of building fighter jets, saying costs for the F-35 were ""out of control"" and that he wanted Boeing to ""price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet.""

220,NOC,"President Trump's budget request calls for a $54 billion increase in defense spending and will give the Defense Department latitude on where the extra money goes, according to a Reuters report, after earlier worries that the White House budget chief would be stingy with the Pentagon.OMB Director Mick Mulvaney was a fiscal hawk and sequester backer when he was in the House of Representatives, and the White House's budget proposal seeks offsetting budget cuts equal to the Defense Department boost in other areas of discretionary spending.But the proposal has more money allotted for ships and military aircraft to have ""a more robust presence in key international waterways and chokepoints,"" an official told Reuters.Lockheed Martin (LMT) shares rose 1.3% to 269.39 on the stock market today, nearing a 270 buy point from a cup base. Northrop Grumman (NOC) advanced 1.45% to 248.60, on its way to a 253.90 entry. Raytheon (RTN) picked up 0.9% to 154.82, still in buy range after breaking out last week. Boeing (BA) climbed 1.1%.General Dynamics (GD) advanced 0.4% and Huntington Ingalls (HII) 0.5%.IBD'S TAKE: Even if Trump ramps up defense spending analysts warn that a massive buildup on the scale of what was seen under President Ronald Reagan is unlikely.The increases in defense spending will be funded by cuts to the State Department, Environmental Protection Agency and other non-military agencies, according to the Reuters report, but won't include cuts from Social Security or Medicare, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Fox News Sunday.Additional specifics weren't available, though Trump could reveal some Tuesday night during his address to a joint session of Congress.During his campaign, he promised to increase the Navy's fleet by 78 ships to at least 350, and add at least 100 combat fighters to the Air Force. He also vowed to boost the Army's ranks by 60,000 and the Marine Corps' by 12,000.But it remains to be seen how the White House plans to balance increases in weapons procurement, which would send more money to the big defense contractors, with increases in personnel spending, which requires putting money in housing, chow halls, uniforms and medical care.The additional dollar on warplanes would come after Trump blasted high military aircraft costs and vowed to get a better deal on Lockheed's F-35 and suggested buying updated Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornets instead.RELATED:Trump: ObamaCare Repeal Before Tax Cuts, Vows 'Big' Infrastructure BoostTrump Silent On Ex-Im Bank, Hints At 'Big' Boeing Super Hornet OrderInfrastructure Stocks Jump As President Trump Vows To Spend 'Big'

221,NOC,"President Trump's call with the Pentagon's F-35 chief and Boeing (BA) CEO Dennis Muilenburg last month could give Lockheed Martin (LMT) and other defense contractors grounds for protest in future competitions, an analyst said.After a House Armed Services subcommittee Thursday, Lt. Gen. Christopher Bogdan, the Defense Department's F-35 program manager, said it wasn't inappropriate that Muilenburg was on a call that then-President-elect Trump made to him on Jan. 17 about Lockheed's F-35.Bogdan said that the discussion centered around Boeing's Air Force One replacement, even though he doesn't work on that program, as well as a comparison of the Navy's F-35C variant vs. a new version of the F/A-18 Super Hornet that Boeing is proposing.""The things I talked about in front of Mr. Muilenburg were clearly publicly releasable information,"" Bogdan said. ""I understand the rules about talking about Lockheed Martin stuff in front of Mr. Muilenburg.""A Lockheed spokeswoman said the company had no comment about the phone call.But Andrew Hunter, director of the Defense-Industrial Initiatives Group at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that even though Bogdan was careful with his words, Boeing could have learned some information that other potential competitors wouldn't have access to, giving it an advantage in future competitions.He added that while Lockheed currently doesn't have any grounds for legal action, if a future competition pitted its F-35C against an advanced Boeing F/A- Super Hornet, then Lockheed would have every right to ask to know what Boeing's CEO heard during that call and could give Lockheed grounds for a bid protest.Boeing shares rose 1.1% to close at 172.71 on the stock market today. Lockheed shares ended flat at 265.35. F-35 subcontractor Northrop Grumman (NOC) was also essentially unchanged at 243.58.Steven Schooner, a professor of government procurement law at George Washington University and former associate administrator for procurement law and legislation at the Office of Management and Budget, said that on the face of things the conversation ""doesn't appear to violate the Procurement Integrity Act"" because there isn't enough information showing that the call involved an actual active procurement.However, if any propriety Lockheed information, such as technology or pricing, was shared, then that would have been ""wildly inappropriate and potentially illegal,"" he added.Still, he couldn't imagine a situation where Lockheed would take legal action: ""Not much reason for Lockheed to poke the bear.""But legal issues aside, Schooner said Trump's phone call could have broken trust between the Pentagon and its industry partners.""Gen. Bogdan is (Lockheed's) partner in a massive enterprise of tremendous importance to the nation, the company and its shareholders,"" he told IBD in an interview. ""That's not the kind of behavior that instills trust and confidence in a business relationship.""Bloomberg first reported that Muilenburg was listening in on the call with Trump, who has attacked Lockheed's fighter program over its costs and suggested it would compete against Boeing's Super Hornet.Bogdan said Thursday that no decisions were made on the call, but the questions asked were the foundation of reviews that Defense Secretary James Mattis has since ordered on the F-35 and Boeing's Air Force One replacement.The F-35 review will look at ""opportunities to significantly reduce the cost"" as well as compare the F-35C to an upgraded Super Hornet.Last month, the Chief of Naval Operations Adm. John Richardson said the F-35 has capabilities that are ""on a completely different level"" than the Super Hornet but noted that the F-35 would be ""supplemented by a healthy cadre of advanced Super Hornets"" going forward.RELATED: Northrop: F-35 Talks With Lockheed Are On Course Since Trump TurbulenceLockheed: Acquisition Officials, Policy Shift More Critical Than Trump On Sales

224,NOC,"ARLINGTON, Va. — The Air Force looks to be ""completely transparent"" about its secretive new stealth bomber, at least on Capitol Hill, while the Pentagon stays tight lipped in public about Northrop Grumman's (NOC) B-21 Raider.Lt. Gen. Arnold Bunch, military deputy in Air Force acquisition, said he met with members of Congress on Wednesday to discuss a preliminary design review on the B-21 as well as provide a schedule of key milestones and other events expected with the bomber, which will replace Cold War-era Boeing (BA) B-52s.But it was unclear from Bunch's comments at an Air Force Association breakfast Thursday if his Capitol Hill discussions included cost figures, the lack of which has drawn stern warnings in the past from Senate Armed Services Chairman John McCain, R-Ariz.He has taken issue with the B-21's cost-plus contract, which puts taxpayers on the hook for any overruns, and with the Air Force's refusal to provide a full cost estimate. So far, the service has only put development costs at $23.5 billion and the per-plane cost at $564 million in 2016 dollars. Analysts, however, estimate the total acquisition price tag could hit $80 billion.""Why would you not want to tell the American people how you are going to spend their dollars?"" McCain asked during a hearing last year. The Air Force countered by saying it doesn't want enemies inferring the plane's capabilities based on price figures.But the B-21 isn't so secret that the Air Force won't disclose the identities of top subcontractors, who can help build more political support among lawmakers seeking Pentagon spending for their states and districts. They include United Technologies' (UTX) Pratt & Whitney, BAE Systems (BAESY) and Rockwell Collins (COL).Northrop shares were down 1.5% at 240.28 on the stock market today. United Tech slipped 0.65% to 112.34 dropping back below its buy point, and Rockwell Collins climbed 0.4%, remaining in buy range. Boeing dipped 0.3%, still above buying territory.But Bunch warned that the public shouldn't expect more information anytime soon.""I don't see us releasing any more details for a period of time,"" he said. ""We've been very open so far. We need to watch how we are communicating. Right now, we've released enough.""RELATED: Air Force To Seek Proposals For Low-Cost Attack Plane ExperimentBattle Stations!

227,NOC,"Botched testing by a Lockheed Martin (LMT) subcontractor on a key component for the U.S.' newest Global Positioning System satellites raises new questions about the No. 1 defense contractor's supervision of the project, according to a top Air Force official.The mistake by subcontractor Harris Corp. (HRS) forced another delay in the delivery of the first of 32 planned GPS III satellites until later this month, according to Major General Roger Teague, the Air Force's chief of space programs. That will make the $528 million satellite 34 months late, according to service data.Lockheed has a contract to build the first 10 of the satellites designed to provide a more accurate version of the Global Positioning System used for everything from the military's targeting of terrorists to turn-by-turn directions for civilians' smartphones.The program's latest setback may affect a pending Air Force decision on whether to open the final 22 satellites to competition from Lockheed rivals Boeing (BA) and Northrop Grumman (NOC).""This was an avoidable situation and raised significant concerns with Lockheed Martin subcontractor management/oversight and Harris program management,"" Teague said in a Dec. 21 message to congressional staff obtained by Bloomberg News. Shares of Lockheed were up fractionally to 257.28 in late-afternoon trading.The parts in question are ceramic capacitors that have bedeviled the satellite project. They take higher-voltage power from the satellite's power system and reduce it to a voltage required for a particular subsystem.Last year, the Air Force and contractors discovered that Harris hadn't conducted tests on the components, including how long they would operate without failing, that should have been completed in 2010.Now, the Air Force says it found that Harris spent June to October of last year doing follow-up testing on the wrong parts instead of samples of the suspect capacitors installed on the first three satellites. Harris ""immediately notified Lockheed and the government"" after a post-test inspection, Teague said in his message.Lockheed spokesman Chip Eschenfelder said in an email said that testing of the capacitors' design was successfully completed in December.""The capacitors met all mission qualification requirements,"" he said, so ""we are confident the capacitors are mission-ready.""Harris spokeswoman Ellen Mitchell said in an email that company personnel last year identified a capacitor ""that was not subjected to all required qualification tests. Once the issue was discovered, Harris deployed a team dedicated to complete the required capacitor tests. The capacitor qualification testing was successfully completed in December 2016.""Teague said in an interview, though, that Harris was required to perform not only a test to show that the part met design specifications but a separate one to assess the component's reliability and whether it met a requirement to last 15 years. That second test wasn't accomplished because ""they used the wrong test item,"" he said.Cristina Chaplain, a military space systems director at the Government Accountability Office, said in an email that the latest problem ""undermines the faith in the progress, if any, that the government and contractor may have been making in turning around a culture that has led to multiyear delays"" and cost increases.The Air Force has decided to accept the first satellite even if its capacitors may be flawed because removing them could delay the delivery until October and cost about $70 million, Teague wrote to the congressional staff. The Air Force is confident in the first satellite's overall reliability based on 3,000 hours of cumulative testing, Teague said.The Air Force will have to pay to replace the suspect capacitors on the second and third satellites. That's because the satellites are being developed under cost-reimbursement-type contracts, which require the Pentagon to pay for cost increases, the service said.In an Air Force list of priorities that lacked funding for this year, the service said it needed $100 million for GPS III ""capacitor repair/replace."" Captain AnnMarie Annicelli, an Air Force spokeswoman, said the list represented potential expenditures on which final decisions had not been made.

228,NOC,"Northrop Grumman (NOC) announced Wednesday that it was dropping out of the Air Force's T-X contest, a week after Raytheon (RTN) ended its partnership with Italy's Leonardo on a bid for the trainer.Northrop and partner BAE Systems said in a release that they are dropping out of the race as ""it would not be in the best interest of the companies and their shareholders.""Northrop shares rose dipped 0.1% to 228.82 on the stock market today. Raytheon shares rose 0.5%.Right now Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Boeing (BA) are the only contenders for the $16.3 billion, 350-aircraft contract. And Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace consultant at Teal Group, thinks Lockheed has the advantage.""You need one of two things to survive a price shootout competition,"" he said. ""You need either no upfront costs or sheer determination and a little bit of desperation.""Lockheed and partner Korea Aerospace Industries are using the existing T-50As and have ""absolutely no upfront costs to speak of to roll into the contract price,"" Aboulafia said.Boeing on the other hand is building a clean-sheet design that is ""heavily optimized"" for the T-X mission, according to Aboulafia. ""They are really eager and aggressive to win it. That matters. You get points for that.""Northrop, an early front-runner for its expertise in building the existing T-38 trainers, already has the B-21 bomber contract and lacks the desperation that Boeing has in the airframe space.Northrop is ""going to be a surviving military airframer into the 2030s. For Boeing, the jury is out.""Boeing lost the B-21 bid in 2015, and production of its F-15 Eagle and F/A-18 Super Hornet will eventually wind down, leaving analysts wondering if Boeing's storied history of building bombers and fighters is coming to an end.Lockheed shares fell 0.2%. Boeing shares rose 0.3%.Last week Raytheon bowed out of the running, saying it and Leonardo were ""unable to reach a business agreement that is in the best interest of the U.S. Air Force.""Mark Bobbi, an aerospace, defense and security analyst at consultancy IHS Markit, said price was probably the reason the Northrop and Raytheon teams dropped out.""No way industry can meet the spec at the unit price USAF wants,"" he wrote in an email. ""You can't get Ferrari performance at a Chevy price.""He said that the Air Force either has to raise the acquisition budget or reduce the number of planes it buys. But getting a larger budget could be a problem under President Trump.""I think the president is going to spend more money on combat aircraft, tanks, ships, sustainment, weapons and missiles than on more for the trainer budget.""Another reason for the possible dropouts is profitability concerns.Profits for subcontractors in the fields of radar and other systems have been much higher than being a prime contractor for a major weapons system, said Andrew Hunter, director of the Defense-Industrial Initiatives Group at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.He said this was especially true of Northrop, given its lead role for the B-21 program.RELATED: Lockheed Sees 2017 Jump In F-35s But Guides Profit Low Amid Cost FlapNorthrop, Raytheon Join Lockheed With Weak Views But New Budget Looms

""We are doing well as a company across our contracts.""Northrop shares rose 1% to 234.79 on the stock market today. Lockheed was up 0.5% to 258.09.After Trump attacked the F-35's costs, he took credit for a $600 million reduction on the 10th batch of fighters after meeting with Lockheed CEO Marillyn Hewson, and industry watchers speculated that Lockheed could put pressure on suppliers like Northrop to lower costs.But before that, the Pentagon predicted a 6%-7% drop in Lot 10 costs and had been working on cuts before the president became involved, according to a Washington Post report.Last week, the Defense Department reached an $8.2 billion deal for 90 F-35s for production Lot 10, a $728 million in total cost reduction vs. Lot 9, according to the Pentagon.IBD's aerospace and defense industry group ranks No. 87 out of 197 groups.

David Goldfein said that each member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff was given five minutes with President Trump last week to talk about their respective military branches and what they do.When his turn came, Goldfein said at a Mitchell Institute breakfast Friday that he stressed the importance of the Air Force's role in the nuclear triad — weapons delivered by land-based missiles, strategic bombers and submarines — space operations and manpower.He didn't specifically mention Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35, of which the Air Force is the biggest buyer.""We have two of the three legs of the nuclear triad and on our worst day as a nation our job as the United States Air Force is to make sure you are where you need to be and make sure you remain connected to nuclear command and control,"" he recounted telling Trump, just before James Mattis was sworn in as defense secretary at a Pentagon ceremony last week.Goldfein also pointed out that the Air Force is responsible for GPS and communications satellites as well as other space-based assets. He stressed the need to continue maintaining air and space superiority, including ""the freedom from attack and the freedom to move"" in both domains.Lastly, Goldfein told Trump about personnel shortages, saying the Air Force was ""too big for the resources we've been given and too small for what the nation demands"" as the service's role expands.Trump's talk with the service chiefs comes as his administration plans to boost spending on weapons and troops, with several big-ticket programs on the way, including Air Force nuclear programs.Last year, the service released its requests for proposals for intercontinental ballistic missiles to replace Boeing's (BA) aging Minuteman system and is also seeking Long-Range Standoff nuclear cruise missiles to replace Boeing AGM-86B Air-Launched Cruise Missiles. Lockheed, Northrop Grumman (NOC), Raytheon (RTN) and Boeing are expected to bid, and initial contracts could be awarded this year.Northrop is also developing the B-21 Raider long-range strategic bomber to replace Cold War-era Boeing B-52s.

237,NOC,"Want to put Fidelity Investments' world-class research resources to work for your retirement accounts and your taxable portfolios? Of course you do.Knowing how the Boston-based asset management giant has deployed the assets of shareholders in its stock mutual funds and balanced funds can help you make decisions about your own buys and sells.For example, in the fourth quarter Fidelity trimmed its exposure to several big technology bellwether stocks. Not all Fidelity funds may act in lockstep, but overall the fund complex lightened its net share count in Facebook (FB) by 5.1%, according to Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF & mutual fund research for CFRA, an independent research firm.Facebook is ranked No. 4 on IBD's Internet-Content industry group, thanks in part to a strong 91 Composite Rating from IBD and 87% average earnings per share growth over the past three quarters. 99 is the highest possible rating, which is on a scale from 1-99.Fidelity's Facebook holding is now at its lightest quarter-end level since the end of 2013, Rosenbluth says in a new report for MarketScope Advisor.Facebook has rallied 16% since the beginning in a year to an all-time high. Subsequent disclosures by Fidelity will reveal whether it's been a buyer of Facebook shares in the current period.The fund complex also trimmed its net share count in Google-owner Alphabet's C-class shares (GOOG) by 5.6% and its A-class shares (GOOGL) by 1.4%. Alphabet has rallied 6% so far this year. It faded after clearing the 816.78 buy point of a flat base on Jan. 23. It's retaken the buy point.Graphics chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) was a third tech big name to be trimmed by Fidelity. Fidelity also trimmed Salesforce.com (CRM), a provider of customer relationship management software.IBD'S TAKE: Nvidia ranks No. 1 in IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Fabless industry group, buoyed by a solid-gold 99 Comp Rating and six straight quarters of EPS growth acceleration. For details, check the stock's vital signs at IBD's Stock Checkup.Still, tech remained Fidelity's biggest sector, accounting for 26% of the fund family's shareholders' money. That was an increase from Sept. 30's 24% and June 30's 23% weighting.And many Fidelity funds, including some of its largest, remained owners of stock in which the overall complex made net trims.For instance, now-$35.3 billion Fidelity Growth Company Fund (FDGRX) held Alphabet, Facebook, Microsoft, Nvidia and Salesforce.com in its top 10 at year-end.And there were several tech names in which Fidelity made net increases in its share counts during Q4.Fidelity boosted its share count in software giant Microsoft (MSFT) by 9.3% to 148 million shares. That was the highest share count since the end of 2014, Rosenbluth wrote.That was the highest share count since the end of 2014, Rosenbluth wrote.""A few other stocks that had double-digit percentage share increases include Autodesk (ADSK),"" Rosenbluth told IBD, referring to the developer of computer-aided design software applications.Financials were Fidelity's second-largest sector, with 15% of shareholders' assets. That increase took place as Fidelity increased its exposure to some big U.S. banks.Bank of America (BAC), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC) all saw double-digit percentage share count growth, Rosenbluth wrote. He added, ""CFRA thinks investor optimism for banks improved amid expectations for higher interest rates and regulatory reform.""President Trump and Congress are widely expected to lighten the regulatory restrictions on some banks.In addition, Fidelity made a double-digit percentage increase in its share count in Capital One Financial (COF).The $414.3 million Fidelity Blue Chip Value (FBCVX) held Alphabet, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo in its top 10 at year end.Fidelity had a 9% weight in industrials as of the end of Q4. Fidelity managers made a 53% net addition to their share count in aerospace and defense contractor Northrop Grumman (NOC) in the quarter. They added 6.7% to their shares in General Electric (GE).Comcast (CMCSA) and Verizon (VZ) were two stocks in which Fidelity managers made double-digit share increases.Tech was not the only space in which Fidelity funds made cuts. Fidelity managers made double-digit decreases to telecom titan AT&T (T), energy explorer and producer Chevron (CVX), medical products maker Medtronic (MDT) and to athletic apparel, footwear and equipment maker Nike (NKE).Each of those decreases appears vindicated at this early point following the quarter. Comp Ratings for each of those stocks current range from an anemic 27 for Chevron to Nike's 59.All of Rosenbluth's data applies to Fidelity's 232 stock and balanced funds (mixtures of stocks and bonds), which together hold nearly $1 trillion in shareholder assets, according to Morningtstar Inc.Fidelity runs an additional 70 funds that hold bonds or commodities, accounting for an additional $233 billion in shareholder money.RELATED:P-s-s-st!

In September, Boeing estimated China would need 6,810 airplanes, valued at $1 trillion, over the next 20 years.To stay competitive Muilenburg said the planned 737 completion plant in Zhoushan is ""an important part of the partnership equation.""""That finishing center is a location where we can add value in China, but every airplane that goes there is built in the U.S.,"" he said. ""It's a great example of how growth in China creates growth in U.S. manufacturing jobs.""Muilenburg was bullish on Trump's focus on the American workforce and tax reforms and regulations for the aerospace sector, but Citron Research warned earlier this month that Trump is a big threat to the industry as he looks to lower military aircraft costs.But strong Q4 results sent Boeing shares up 4.2% to 167.36, hitting record highs on the stock market today, continuing to break out after just clearing a 160.17 buy point on Monday. European rival Airbus (EADSY) fell 0.8%.Adjusted Q4 earnings jumped 54% to $2.47 a share, marking its fastest growth in more than three years, as revenue dipped 1% to $23.29 billion, better than forecasts for $23.19 billion.Commercial aircraft revenue rose 1% to $16.24 billion, as Q4 deliveries edged up 1.6% to 185. Defense, space and security revenue fell 12% to $6.86 billion.

Operating cash flow is seen increasing to $10.75 billion next year from $10.5 billion in 2016, as the 787 program has finally turned cash-flow positive, boosting prospects for more stock buybacks and dividend hikes.Boeing's commercial division has been pressured by Airbus in recent years and its hot-selling A321neo. Boeing plans to roll out a stretched version of the latest 737 Max to hold on to market share before launching a new fell 0.6%.Boeing's 737 Max 10X plane will carry 190-230 people and could launch in 2020, according to reports earlier this month. Management said in October that the new midsize plane could be delivered by 2024-2025.On the defense side, Boeing had come under fire from Trump over the high costs of its Air Force One replacement program. But Muilenburg met with Trump and said the company could build a new Air Force One for under $4 billion.But Trump also tweeted last month that he asked Boeing to price out a F/A-18 Super Hornet ""comparable"" to the F-35. But Pentagon officials said they need the new Lockheed Martin (LMT) F-35 for stealth and other fifth-generation capabilities that the Super Hornet lacks.Shares of Lockheed, which reported Q4 results above analyst views on Tuesday but gave weak 2017 EPS guidance, dipped 1.1% Wednesday.Also Wednesday, Textron (TXT) said Q4 earnings fell 3.7% to 78 cents per share, falling short of views 87 cents. Revenue was down 2.5% to $3.83 billion, under views for $3.9 billion.

240,NOC,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — Chief of Naval Operations Adm. John Richardson said Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 has capabilities that are ""on a completely different level"" than Boeing's (BA) F/A-18 Super Hornet, which President-elect Donald Trump has suggested may compete against the more advanced stealth jet.In a ""Defense One"" sponsored event Tuesday, Richardson said the Super Hornet, which is considered a 4th-generation fighter, could be upgraded to a 4.5-generation fighter and noted that the Navy's carrier air wing will consist of 5th- and 4th-generation fighters ""in the foreseeable future.""""We need the F-35s,"" he said. ""That is our 5th-gen capability which we need, supplemented by healthy cadre of advanced Super Hornets.""Addressing Trump's complaints about the F-35's costs and his vow to lower them, Richardson added, ""We need that capability, and we need to get it at the very best price for the taxpayer.""Shares of Lockheed were down 0.2% to 254.12 at the close on the stock market today. Northrop Grumman (NOC), a major subcontractor on the F-35, was off 0.7% to 228.48, and United Technologies (UTX), whose Pratt & Whitney unit makes the engines, slipped 0.2% to 109.97. Boeing dipped 0.7% to 157.67.Amid expectations for a bigger shipbuilding budget, Richardson said the Navy would prioritize resources on ships that are being built now, such as destroyers, attack submarines and amphibious warfare ships.""The industrial base is ready to respond"" to the call for more ships, Richardson said.Shares of shipbuilder General Dynamics (GD) lost 1.1% to close at 175.97 while rival Huntington Ingalls (HII) fell 1% to 189.61.RELATED: Lockheed Notes F-35 Jobs From Production Hike As Trump Blasts CostsAir Force Lays Out Big, Early Decisions For Trump's Administration

241,NOC,"Retired Marine Gen. James Mattis is likely to face little opposition from the Democrats as President-elect Donald Trump's Defense Secretary nominee, and analysts expect his confirmation hearing Thursday to be more about Trump's policies and where Mattis stands.The hearing is scheduled for 9:30 a.m. ET before the Senate Armed Services Committee, which will likely grill Mattis on Iran, major procurement programs and civilian control of the Defense Department.Senators could ask about the Pentagon's commitment to buy more than 2,400 Lockheed Martin (LMT) F-35s for the Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps.On Wednesday, Trump blasted the high costs of the F-35 and said there would more competition on fighter jets, implying Boeing's (BA) F/A-18 Super Hornet could get more orders.Senate Armed Services Chairman Sen. John McCain has been critical of Northrop Grumman's (NOC) B-21 bomber, blasting the Air Force for failing to give more specific cost figures, and could bring it up with Mattis. The service has put development costs at $23.5 billion and per-plane costs at $564 million in 2016 dollars, but analysts have said the total acquisition costs are near $80 billion.Mattis could also be questioned on Trump's plan to expand the Navy and the often-criticized littoral combat ship, two types of which are being built by Lockheed and an Austal-General Dynamics (GD) team. The cost per ship nearly doubled and key capabilities like mine countermeasures have been delayed.Nuclear weapons may come up, as Trump has tweeted that the U.S. ""must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability.""The Pentagon is looking to recapitalize its nuclear triad of land-based missiles, ballistic missile-launching submarines, and strategic bombers, in an effort costing hundreds of billions of dollars.But in the past, Mattis has questioned the need for land-based nuclear weapons and asked at a 2015 Senate hearing if it was ""time to reduce the triad to a diad"" as it ""would reduce the false alarm danger.""IBD'S TAKE: Overall prospects are good for the defense industry in 2017 as Trump has vowed to buy more warships and fighter jets but will he actually follow through with his spending ramp up?But most questions will likely focus on ""opening up some daylight between Mattis and Trump,"" according to Mark Cancian, a senior advisor at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.""This will be the opportunity for the Democrats to express their concerns and disagreements with Trump's statements on a whole variety of subjects.""Democrats will also question some of Mattis' comments on Iran. Trump has said he wants to tear up the nuclear agreement, and this is where he and Mattis might see eye to eye. At a CSIS presentation last year, Mattis said Iran ""is the single most enduring threat to stability and peace in the Middle East.""Other possible questions include Mattis' position on Trump's remarks that Japan should become a nuclear power and that the U.S. should pull support from NATO.Civilian control of the military will be another big topic at the hearing. The cabinet position is a civilian role, and Mattis would need Congress to waive the requirement to be retired from the military for at least seven years. Mattis has only been out since 2013.Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., said earlier she would vote against a wavier for Mattis.Democrats will be ""looking for assurance that Mattis will respect civilian control of the military and understands his new role as the head civilian in the department and not as an officer,"" Cancian said.RELATED: After Trump's F-35 Blast, Here's The 'Good, The Bad And The Ugly'Air Force Lays Out Big, Early Decisions For Trump's Administration

Boeing ticked up 0.3% as it confirmed a big SpiceJet aircraft order earlier Friday.Lockheed and the Pentagon are in talks for the next order of F-35s this month.At his confirmation hearing Thursday, retired Marine Gen. James Mattis, Trump's defense secretary nominee, backed the F-35 program, saying the fighter ""is critical for our own air superiority in the future because of stealth characteristics and some of the electronics capability that's inherent in the airplane.""Mattis also empathized that Trump has ""in no way shown any lack of support"" for the F-35, but just wants ""bang for his buck.""Other defense CEOs could be making a trip to see Trump as Huntington Ingalls Industries' (HII) aircraft carriers, General Dynamics' (GD) and Lockheed's littoral combat ships, and Northrop Grumman's (NOC) B-21 could be the next big defense programs under fire from the president-elect.Trump ""is clearly not shy about expressing his opinions, and it's having a major effect on the defense industry,"" Mark Cancian, a senior advisor at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told IBD Wednesday.Huntington Ingalls rose 0.3%. Northrop edged up 0.45%. General Dynamics climbed 0.8%.Trump has also blasted drugmakers like Amgen (AMGN) and Biogen (BIIB) for ""getting away with murder.""He also took aim at General Motors (GM) last week for ""sending Mexican made models of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers tax-free across border.""GM fought back, saying that all Cruze sedans were built in the U.S. and only a ""small number"" of Cruze hatchbacks built in Mexico are sold in the U.S.RELATED: On Pentagon Spending, Will Trump Put Your Money Where His Mouth Is?Air Force Lays Out Big, Early Decisions For Trump's Administration

243,NOC,"Retired Marine Gen. James Mattis, who has been tapped as defense secretary, said Thursday that Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 stealth fighter is key for the U.S. and its allies and supports having human pilots fly Northrop Grumman's (NOC) forthcoming B-21 bomber.The F-35 — which has an acquisition price tag of about $400 billion for more than 2,400 planes — has come under sustained criticism from President-elect Donald Trump, who again blasted the program Wednesday for being behind schedule and over budget. He also suggested the F-35 would face competition from Boeing's (BA) F/A-18 Super Hornet.The F-35 ""is critical for our own air superiority in the future because of stealth characteristics and some of the electronics capability that's inherent in the airplane,"" Mattis said during his confirmation hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee.Trump has ""in no way shown any lack of support"" for the F-35, he added, but just wants ""bang for his buck.""Top U.S. allies like the U.K., Israel, Italy and Australia are also partners on the F-35 program (which is in production) or are buyers.""Many of our allies have bet their air superiority on their F-35 program, and it bonds us closely together with them,"" Mattis said earlier.When asked about the B-21 Raider, he paused and said he supports a manned bomber. That program, which is in early development, has been criticized by Senate Armed Services Chairman John McCain for not being more transparent on its total acquisition costs, which analysts have put at $50 billion to $80 billion.Northrop's B-21 isn't currently being designed to be unmanned but that capability would be a consideration in the future, the Air Force said last year.Shares of Lockheed closed down 1% at 252.62 on the stock market today. Northrop, which is also a major F-35 subcontractor, fell 1% as well to finish at 229.15, and Boeing slipped 0.7% to 158.29.Mattis also voiced support for the recapitalization of U.S. nuclear assets, including the Columbia-class ballistic-missile submarine, which will replace Ohio-class ""boomers,"" as well as development of new ground-based intercontinental ballistic missiles.General Dynamics (GD) is the prime contractor for the Columbia-class subs, which are in the design phase. Lockheed, Northrop, Boeing and Raytheon (RTN) are expected to bid on the ICBM contract.But Mattis said he needs to look at the deterrence capabilities of the Long-Range Standoff nuclear cruise missile meant to replace Boeing AGM-86B Air-Launched Cruise Missiles. That program's cost has been estimated at $20 billion to $30 billion.In prepared remarks ahead of the hearing, he also said he would review the Littoral Combat Ship program.Last month, McCain criticized the Navy for spending $12.4 billion on 26 ships. The cost per LCS has nearly doubled to $478 million, and key capabilities like mine countermeasures have been delayed.Lockheed and separate team made up of Australia's Austal and General Dynamics are building different versions of the LCS.Shares of General Dynamics ended 0.3% lower at 176.52, though Mattis has said he would recuse himself from matters related to GD for one year. He also said he would resign from GD's board and divest his GD stock.Meanwhile, the Senate Armed Services Committee voted 24-3 in favor of waiving the requirement for a Pentagon chief to be retired from the military for at least seven years. Mattis has only been out since 2013.

247,NOC,"Lockheed Martin (LMT) expects a surge in F-35 deliveries this year but gave weak earnings guidance as the defense giant comes under intense pressure from the White House to cut costs on the massive program.The Pentagon's top contractor expects to deliver 66 of the stealth jets in 2017, up 43% from the 46 delivered last year, though that fell short of its goal for 53.But Lockheed sees 2017 EPS of $12.25-$12.55, below consensus views for $12.87, on revenue of $49.4 billion-$50.6 billion, with the midpoint above the Wall Street estimate of $49.59 billion.The $400 billion F-35 program is becoming an increasing critical part of Lockheed's business as production, and deliveries, ramp up.

252,NOC,"President Donald Trump is as risky for the aerospace industry as Hillary Clinton was to drug manufacturers, according to a report Friday from a noted short seller, which also warned on aerospace supplier TransDigm's (TDG).""President Trump has promised to end the long-standing, infuriating tradition of 'sticking the US Government with tab,' "" Citron Research said in a note. ""He has already made lowering prices for military aircraft a pillar of his transition into office.""During his transition, Trump took to Twitter (TWTR) to call out Boeing (BA) and Lockheed Martin (LMT) over high costs for Air Force One and the F-35 program respectively.After meeting with Trump, Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg said the company could build a new Air Force One for under $4 billion.Lockheed CEO Marillyn Hewson said after her meeting with Trump that an upcoming contract for the next batch of F-35 fighters will create thousands of jobs and that the company is near a deal for 90 additional F-35s that will ""significantly"" reduce the costs.Last month, the Pentagon's program office said that costs would likely come down ""6%-7%"" for the 10th batch of fighters.Boeing shares rose 0.3% to 159.53 on the stock market today. Lockheed shares climbed 0.3% to 257.73.But Boeing and Lockheed likely won't be the last aerospace companies that Trump targets. Citron wrote that TransDigm's business model relies too much on raising prices to turn a profit, potentially putting it in Trump's cross hairs in the future.The company ""acquires airplane parts companies (over 50 in total), fires employees, and egregiously raises prices"" just like drugmaker Valeant (VRX), Citron claimed.TransDigm didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.Shares plunged 9.9% to 226.90.TransDigm is a major supplier to Boeing, Lockheed, Northrop Grumman (NOC), Raytheon (RTN) and other aerospace giants.IBD'S TAKE: The littoral combat ship, nuclear missiles and Northrop's B-21 are other defense programs Trump could take aim at next.Despite the perception that Trump would be friendlier to the drug industry than Clinton would have been, Trump has recently accused drugmakers of ""getting away with murder"" on prices and has vowed to lower them.RELATED: Navy: Lockheed F-35 'On A Completely Different Level' Vs.

"
258,NOC,"Overall prospects are good for the defense industry in 2017 as President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to buy more warships and fighter jets, but analysts warn that a massive buildup on the scale of what was seen under President Ronald Reagan is unlikely.During his campaign, Trump said he would eliminate the ""sequester"" budget constraints on the Pentagon and increase spending. But after the election, Trump named Rep. Mick Mulvaney, a fiscal hawk and sequester backer, as the director of the Office of Management and Budget.""I'm very tempered in the kind of new money I would expect to see in any so-called buildup,"" and the defense industry should ""restrain expectations,"" said Mackenzie Eaglen, a national security analyst at the American Enterprise Institute.And despite Trump's aggressive campaign talk on defense, he has signaled reluctance to pay up, blasting the costs of Boeing's (BA) Air Force One replacement program and Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35. After his Twitter (TWTR) rants, top defense stocks gave up their postelection gains and haven't recovered.Wall Street expects Q4 numbers to show that growth at Lockheed, Northrop Grumman and Raytheon picked up in 2016, but it sees a slowdown in 2017, though that could change when the White House's plans become clearer.Analysts and investors will get their first look at Trump's spending priorities when he submits a defense supplemental budget request within his first 100 days. In the spring, the fiscal 2018 budget proposal comes out. And later in the year, the administration will lay out the Pentagon's next five-year plan.Trump has said he wants to grow the Army by 60,000 soldiers and the Marine Corps by 12,000 Marines as well as boost the Navy's fleet by 78 to 350 ships and add at least 100 combat aircraft at the Air Force.More troops mean the Pentagon will spend more on pay, health care, chow halls and housing. Those costs could crowd out demand for big-budget ground weapons, like a new armored vehicle to replace the Army's Bradley fighting vehicles and Abrams tanks, meaning limited upside for defense contractors hoping for lucrative deals.But targeting a certain fleet size means more Navy ships have to be ordered.Mark Cancian, a senior advisor at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, sees Trump adding more next-generation attack submarines, noting that the Virginia-class sub is already in serial production and should avoid Trump's ire.""They don't have the same problems that have been the subject of those tweets,"" Cancian told IBD. ""Those were programs that have had or have the prospects of significant cost increases.""But new Columbia-class ballistic-missile submarines could come under fire eventually, as their overall costs become more apparent, he added.General Dynamics (GD) and Huntington Ingalls (HII) are building the Virginia-class subs, while GD is the prime contractor for the Columbia-class ""boomers,"" which are in the design phase.IBD'S TAKE: The defense industry isn't the only one falling prey to Trump's tweet storms. Trump attacked General Motors for sending Mexican-made cars to U.S. dealers and threatened to levy big import taxes on cars built outside the U.S.Trump has also been a proponent of strengthening America's nuclear arsenal, tweeting last month that the U.S. ""must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability"" and called for an arms race as Russian President Vladimir Putin reportedly looks for missiles that can evade countermeasures.So the ballistic-missile subs, along with Northrop Grumman's (NOC) B-21 Raider, could be safe from attack, according to Mark Bobbi, an aerospace, defense and security analyst at consultancy IHS Markit.Meanwhile, the Air Force's request for intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) to replace Boeing's aging Minuteman system as well as Long-Range Standoff (LRSO) nuclear cruise missiles to replace Boeing AGM-86B Air-Launched Cruise Missiles will also likely be funded.""Those are probably the two programs that are on the edge, and my guess is that (Trump) would buy both of those, whereas a Democratic administration might not have,"" Cancian said.The estimated cost of the ICBM program is $62 billion over 30 years, but reports say the Air Force's estimate is billions of dollars short. The LRSO plan's cost has been estimated at $20 billion to $30 billion. Boeing, Raytheon, Northrop and Lockheed are expected to bid on the two programs, and initial contracts are expected to be awarded this year.Another Air Force priority is the F-35, and Trump's pledge to give the Air Force 100 more combat aircraft could help the program, despite his suggestion that Lockheed's orders may be reduced in favor of more Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornets.The Air Force is getting more than 70% of the Pentagon's total procurement of 2,443 F-35s, and it doesn't currently fly the Super Hornet, making it an unlikely addition to the service's fleet.The F-35 is also in production, and costs are already falling as output increases. IHS Markit's Bobbi said Trump will still likely fund the F-35 program after getting further price reductions.And flying under the radar is the Air Force's $16 billion T-X program for 350 trainer aircraft, which Boeing, Lockheed, Northrop and Raytheon are seeking. Bobbi said Trump ""has bigger fish to fry.""Israel is also buying the F-35 and recently increased its order amid a wider rebound in international defense spending as regional tensions in the Middle East, Asia and Europe intensify.Despite funding pressure from lower oil prices, Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states will invest in more weapons systems as Iran is expected to update its arsenal. Kuwait, Qatar and Bahrain already have F-15s and Super Hornets on order from Lockheed and Boeing.Cancian sees Japan and South Korea buying more missile defense systems from the U.S. as China adds military hardware to its man-made islands in the South China Seas and North Korea tests more nuclear warheads and missiles. South Korea plans to deploy Lockheed's Terminal High Altitude Area Defense anti-missile system later this year, and Japan is considering it as well.IHS Jane's expects defense investment in the Baltic states to double over the next two years and Western European spending to ""strengthen over the next decade"" on Trump's threats to pull out of NATO unless other members contributed more.""Defense spending returned to a healthy rate of growth in 2016, kicking off what we expect to be a decade of stronger global defense spending,"" said Fenella McGerty, principal analyst at IHS Jane's, in a release. ""Defense spending should recover to pre-financial-crisis levels by 2018.""RELATED: Battle Stations! Which Pentagon Programs Could Trump Attack Next?Here's Where Lockheed Could Lose F-35 Orders To Boeing F/A-18s 
"
259,NOC,"First, President-elect Donald Trump took aim at Boeing's (BA) Air Force One replacement program, then he targeted Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 and suggested that the Pentagon might buy more Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornets instead.So what Pentagon program could be next to get the Trump treatment?Trump has said he would build up the Navy's fleet to 350 ships from its current 272, but the ramp-up would come at a high cost.Lockheed could be in Trump's crosshairs again. It is building the littoral combat ship, while a separate team made up of Australia's Austal and General Dynamics (GD) is building a different version of the LCS. The ships are designed to operate in coastal — or littoral — waters.The program is already coming under scrutiny, and earlier this month Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain blasted the Navy for spending $12.4 billion on 26 ships. The cost per ship has nearly doubled to $478 million, and key capabilities like mine countermeasures have been delayed.Trump must decide if the Navy will purchase 12 more of the ships for a total cost of $14 billion.Lockheed shares fell 0.5% at 249.56 on the stock market today. General Dynamics dipped 0.9%.Huntington Ingalls (HII) is currently building the USS John F. Kennedy, a second Ford-class aircraft carrier, with a projected cost of $11.35 billion.Among a list of options, the Congressional Budget Office said in a report earlier this month that the Navy could save $21 billion from 2018 through 2026 if it stopped building new aircraft carriers after the current ship is completedCanceling just one carrier would free up funds to buy less-expensive, smaller ships to achieve Trump's goal of boosting the size of the fleet.Huntington Ingalls shares were off 0.7%.Trump wants to build up America's nuclear arsenal, but that won't come cheaply either.The cost of Northrop Grumman's (NOC) B-21 bomber, which will replace Cold War-era Boeing B-52s, is a big question mark as the Air Force has declined to give specific figures, saying U.S. adversaries would be able to infer its capabilities.McCain has been critical of that approach, arguing that taxpayers deserve to know how much they are spending on the plane.The Air Force has put the development cost for the long range strike bomber at $23.5 billion and the per-plane cost at $564 million in 2016 dollars. Analysts estimate the total acquisition cost at up to $80 billion.Northrop shares edged 0.6% lower to 231.92.America's nuclear missiles are nearing the end of their life spans and need to be replaced.Over the summer, the Air Force released its requests for proposals for intercontinental ballistic missiles to replace Boeing's Minuteman system.The Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent's estimated cost is $62 billion over 30 years, but a report from the Pentagon's office of independent cost assessment said the estimate is too low by ""billions of dollars,"" according to a Bloomberg report.The Air Force also needs Long-Range Standoff nuclear cruise missiles to replace its Boeing AGM-86B Air-Launched Cruise Missiles. The program will likely come at a cost of $20 billion to $30 billion.RELATED: Here's Where Lockheed Could Lose F-35 Orders To Boeing F/A-18sAfter Trump's F-35 Blast, Here's The 'Good, The Bad And The Ugly'

261,NOC,"President-elect Donald Trump's suggestion late Thursday that cost overruns on Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 could result in orders for Boeing's (BA) older and less capable F/A-18 Super Hornet only makes sense for the Navy, according to a Drexel Hamilton analyst.Based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns of the Lockheed Martin F-35, I have asked Boeing to price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 22, 2016Earlier this month, Trump blasted the F-35 program for having ""out of control"" costs. On Monday, Pentagon officials said costs for successive production batches have been coming down and will continue to fall. On Wednesday, he met with Lockheed's CEO. But Trump's latest tweet keeps the heat on the defense contractor.""In our view, the F-35 could be shaping up to be the biggest target for defense savings through President-elect Donald Trump's term in office,"" Drexel Hamilton analyst Pete Skibitski wrote in a note Friday.The cost to develop and build the F-35 is about $400 billion, and the Pentagon is buying 2,443 F-35s for the Air Force (1,763), Navy (340) and Marine Corps (340), with U.S. allies buying hundreds more.The Super Hornet lacks short-takeoff and vertical-landing capabilities so is likely not a good fit for the Marine Corps, and the Air Force doesn't fly the plane now so it's unlikely to fit in there, Skibitski noted. But the Navy, which already has a large number of Super Hornets in its fleet, represents the biggest risk for Lockheed.Each Super Hornet costs roughly $50 million, which is about 40% cheaper than the F-35's projected $85 million unit cost by 2019.Skibitski estimates that if the Navy goes with the F/A-18, it would jeopardize $28.9 billion for Lockheed and the company would lose 6% a year in earnings before interest and taxes over the next decade.Lockheed shares fell 1.3% to 249.54 on the stock market today, moving back below their 50-day line. Boeing shares climbed 0.2%. Major F-35 subcontractor Northrop Grumman (NOC) was off 0.4%, while F-35 engine supplier United Technologies (UTX) edged up 0.2%.Skibitski also pointed out ""there is a clear technology difference"" between the F-35 and Super Hornet. The stealthy F-35 is a ""fifth generation"" fighter, while the Super Hornet doesn't have stealth technology and is considered a fourth generation fighter.And the Pentagon can't just award Boeing a fighter contact without holding a new competition.""The government would be violating the law to award a contract to Boeing without a competition unless they go through exceptions to the normal legal requirements for competition,"" Daniel Gordon, the Obama administration's administrator for federal procurement policy, told the Wall Street Journal. RELATED: Trump Seeks To Cancel Air Force One Order, Targets Boeing ProfitTrump Goes Nuclear, But This Time Lockheed, Northrop, Raytheon Rise
"
262,NOC,"Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 wowed crowds at the Farnborough Airshow in the U.K. last month, streaking across the sky, hovering in midair and even flying backward. Weeks later, the Air Force declared its version of the F-35 combat ready. Despite ongoing concerns about its development, the stealth fighter continues to reach key milestones, and production will hit full speed in a few years.Meanwhile, Northrop Grumman (NOC), which is a major subcontractor on the F-35, has locked down the other key piece of the Pentagon's combat aircraft upgrade cycle, winning the B-21 contract last year to build replacements for Cold War-era Boeing (BA) B-52s.With the $400 billion F-35 and $80 billion B-21 contracts in hand, Lockheed and Northrop would appear to have established air superiority. But there are hundreds of billions of Pentagon aerospace dollars still up for grabs, and demand overseas for high-tech missiles is on the rise, meaning Lockheed, Northrop, Raytheon (RTN) and Boeing can make more money and boost their shares as the new weapons stay in service for decades.""The general view at the moment is that investors prefer the longer horizon of a defense portfolio,"" said Howard Rubel, Jefferies managing director in equity research. ""If you look at the viability of Northrop or Raytheon today, there is enough turmoil that defense will continue to grow at a faster rate than the overall economy.""And Lockheed's expected organic growth of 4% through 2018 tops the 2.8% pace for the overall defense sector, Goldman Sachs said Wednesday, citing the F-35 program's size. Growth at Northrop, Raytheon and Flir Systems (FLIR), however, could outpace Lockheed's, Goldman added.Lockheed shares fell 1.65% Friday and are up 12.6% so far this year. Northrop dipped 0.7% but has seen a 12% climb in 2016. Raytheon has run 13% higher, while Boeing has lost 8.5%.IBD'S TAKE: Lockheed shares have eased below buy range, Northrop is 5.5% below an entry point, while Raytheon is above buying territory. While Boeing has been a drag on the Aerospace/Defense group, the pure-play defense stocks have helped lift the industry group to No. 66 out of the 197 IBD tracks, and they also have been boosting their dividends.Boeing, however, is entering a transition period in its defense unit, which lost the B-21 bid with partner Lockheed. As production of its F-15 Eagle and F/A-18 Super Hornet eventually winds down, Boeing -- whose 100-year history includes icons like the B-17 Flying Fortress and the P-51 Mustang -- faces the prospect of no longer making fighters or bombers.In July, Boeing's top defense executive said that the aerospace giant would shift its focus from new fighter jets to maintenance services on existing aircraft, new helicopters, satellites, space programs, and selling more military versions of its passenger jets. But Boeing said that decision wasn't based on one contract loss.""No one competition is going to drive that. It's a matter of managing the investment portfolio that we have with the opportunity and campaigns that we want to go after and win,"" Steve Nordlund, Boeing's vice president for strategy for defense, space and security, said in an interview.Boeing, Lockheed, Northrop, Raytheon and other defense contractors are turning their sights to U.S. nuclear missile contracts that could be worth more than $90 billion.Late last month, the Air Force released requests for proposals for a Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD) intercontinental ballistic missile to replace Boeing's aging Minuteman system, and a Long-Range Standoff (LRSO) nuclear cruise missile to replace Boeing AGM-86B Air-Launched Cruise Missiles.The GBSD's estimated cost is $62 billion over 30 years (though an independent Pentagon cost assessment found that estimate is too low). The LRSO's cost has been estimated at $20 billion-$30 billion. Boeing, Raytheon, Northrop and Lockheed are expected to bid on the two contracts, and initial contracts are expected to be awarded next year.Boeing officials were bullish in a recent interview with IBD that they would win the award for the GBSD, based on past work in the field.""We are confident the Air Force can rely on us, given our proven commitment,"" said Rich Choppa, director of global sales and marketing at Boeing's defense unit. ""We are just as committed to developing a new system as we were back in 1958 when we developed the Minuteman system that stood the test of time.""Other potential prime contractors for the Minuteman upgrade include Lockheed and Northrop. Some 37 other contractors are bidding on subcontractor work.The issue of ""helicopter money"" isn't limited to central banks. But unlike the European Central Bank or the Bank of Japan, the Pentagon isn't contemplating a massive dump of cash from hovering helicopters. Instead, the Pentagon is preparing a massive dump of cash onto makers of helicopters.While less sexy than fighter jets and supersonic missiles, the U.S. military's fleet of helicopters is also due for an upgrade. The Army is looking to replace its Black Hawk helicopters as heavy use in Afghanistan and Iraq have worn them out faster than expected. Textron's (TXT) Bell division is competing against a Boeing-Sikorsky team.The Army is also looking at replacements for its Boeing AH-64 Apache and CH-47 Chinook as well as its Bell OH-58 Kiowa. Providing helicopters to take the places of all four aircraft will be worth an estimated $100 billion. The Pentagon is expected to seek official proposals in 2019, followed by a contract award in 2020.""We feel very strong about our military helicopter position in the market place and the capabilities we would provide customers,"" Boeing's Nordlund said.Lockheed has spent heavily in helicopters, acquiring Sikorsky from United Technologies (UTX) last year for $9 billion and is looking to recoup its investment.Lockheed, Boeing, Raytheon and Northrop are all competing for another major Pentagon contract: the Air Force's $8 billion-$10 billion T-X trainer jet, which will be used to train F-22 and F-35 pilots and has potential for massive overseas sales to international customers like the U.K., Italy and others who are buying the F-35.Raytheon is on an industry team that includes Finmeccanica and CAE. Lockheed has partnered with Korea Aerospace Industries. Boeing and Saab are bidding together, and Northrop is leading a coalition that includes BAE Systems and L-3 Communications (LLL). The competition is expected to be fierce, and a contract award is expected late next year.On Lockheed's Q2 conference call, CEO Marillyn Hewson called its upgraded T-50A, which completed its first test flight in South Korea in June, ""a very good offering. It's an excellent solution. It's low risk.""Boeing has kept its design under wraps, only releasing concept art of the nose of a jet, though more details are expected next month. Pictures of a Northrop prototype in Mojave, Calif., leaked out earlier this week and appeared to share some similarities with the Air Force's current trainer jet, the T-38, which is also made by Northrop.Boeing, Lockheed, Northrop and privately held General Atomics are the likely bidders for the Navy's aerial-refueling drone, the MQ-25A Stingray.The program has been scaled back from its original inception, which envisioned a drone that would perform strike and surveillance missions.The Navy is still working on the requirements for the tanker drone, but stealth won't be on that list, Vice Adm. Mike Shoemaker told reporters earlier this month. The service plans to issue a formal request for proposals in the second half of next year and award a contract in 2018.Derrick Maple, unmanned systems analyst at IHS Markit, estimates that development, production and support costs could reach $6 billion.As missiles become more advanced, foreign governments are increasingly looking to them to boost defenses amid deepening global tensions.Last year, Raytheon booked a $2 billion order from Saudi Arabia for its Patriot missile and air defense system. South Korea and Japan are also paying Raytheon to upgrade their Patriot systems as the missile threat from North Korea looms. And by year's end, the Polish government is expected to finalize a Patriot deal that is estimated at $5.5 billion amid rising friction with Russia.Raytheon is also working with Israel's Rafael Advanced Defense Systems on revamping the Iron Dome defense system for its bid for the U.S. Army's Indirect Fire Protection Capability Increment 2 as protection against missiles and drones, among other threats.Raytheon isn't alone in the missile-defense market. Lockheed's THAAD system will be stationed in South Korea by late 2017. Lockheed and partner MBDA, a European defense giant, are bidding on a $4.5 billion German missile-defense deal that could be wrapped up later this year.And while U.S. involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan has greatly diminished over the last decade, the war against ISIS is boosting demand for munitions. Berenberg analysts said earlier this year that they expect sales of Lockheed's Hellfire missiles and the Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missiles to climb 7%-8% this year on ""restocking activities in the U.S. and export demand.""Geopolitical strains should continue spurring more spending. In addition to the Islamic State in the Middle East, Beijing's territorial claims in the South China Sea, and Russia flexing its muscles in Eastern Europe, disputes with China in the East China Sea are leading Japan to develop a land-to-sea missile system of its own. Top U.S. defense contractors may get involved.""The thing with these top-tier contractors, they have a lot of capabilities they can apply to various product areas that they want to invest in,"" Jefferies analyst Rubel said.RELATED:Lockheed F-35 'On A Path Toward Failing To Deliver' Full CapabilityNavy To Modernize Boeing Super Hornets To Fly With Lockheed F-35Boeing May Extend F/A-18 Work On Kuwait, Navy OrdersAir Force Touts Combat-Ready F-35 As 'Deterrent To Adversaries'

But the memo puts these timelines in doubt as issues with software and other systems continue.The program ""is running out of time and money to complete the planned flight testing and implement the required fixes and modifications,"" the memo said according to the Bloomberg report.

But a separate estimate from the Pentagon's office of independent cost assessment found that number is likely too low by ""billions of dollars,"" sources told Bloomberg.Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman are all vying for the new ICBM program.Boeing shares fell 0.2% in the stock market today. Lockheed sank 0.4%, and Northrop rose 0.7%.IBD'S TAKE: Several defense firms are in buy range after strong earnings results last month. See how Minuteman III maker Boeing's shares stack up against other stronger players in the group on Stock Checkup.  The cost discrepancy comes as the Air Force looks to expand production rates on the F-35 in the coming years and continues developing the B-21. In addition to those programs, the Air Force is also looking at a new Long-Range Standoff nuclear cruise missile to replace Boeing AGM-86B Air-Launched Cruise Missiles and is buying new aerial refueling tankers. Last week, the Pentagon OK'd a contract for Boeing to produce the first 19 KC-46 tankers in a deal worth $2.8 billion.The outlays for the Air Force programs are expected to create what analysts have called a ""bow wave"" of costs expected to slam the budget around 2021. To deal with it, a study early this year by the Center for Strategic and International Studies said the Pentagon will require a bigger budget or must delay several strategic programs.But the Navy, for example, won't see a similar bow wave, as its Ohio-class submarine replacement program ramps up while several of aircraft programs wind down over the next 10 years.

270,NOC,"WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35A is now ready to deploy to Syria or any other global hot spot, and the Air Force sees the stealth fighter as a symbol of U.S. strength.
"
271,NOC,"On Tuesday, the Air Force approved its version of the fighter for combat, after the first 12 F-35As met mission requirements, such as combat air support, suppression of enemy air defenses, and other operations in a contested environment. The Air Force eventually plans to procure 1,763 F-35As.
"
272,NOC,"For now, the service's F-35A squadron will fly out of Hill Air Force Base in Utah. But if commanders in the field request it, the F-35A will deploy overseas, Gen. Hawk Carlisle, commander of Air Combat Command, told reporters at the Pentagon. He added that the F-35 will likely see action sooner than the F-22 did. Lockheed's F-22 was declared ready for combat in 2005 but didn't engage in combat until 2014 when it struck ISIS targets in Syria. Earlier opportunities to deploy the F-22 were seen as too provocative, but Carlisle said sending the F-35 to the Middle East or Europe today would ""reassure friends and is a deterrent to adversaries.""Lockheed shares closed up 0.85% on the stock market today. Northrop Grumman (NOC), a major subcontractor on the F-35 program, gained 0.9%. United Technologies (UTX), which makes the engines for the fighter, dipped 0.6%.IBD'S TAKE: Several defense firms are in buy range after strong earnings results. See how Lockheed's shares stack up against others in the group on Stock Checkup.  In July 2015, the F-35B variant was declared combat-ready by the Marines and is set for deployment to Japan in 2017. The Navy's version, the F-35C, is expected to be combat-ready between 2018 and 2019.Although the F-35A has now reached initial operational capability (IOC), it must wait until next year to have full war-fighting capabilities as part of its 3F software upgrade, which will enable the F-35 to fire its 25 mm Gatling gun, among other things.And the fighter won't reach full operational capability until the 2021-2022 time frame, when two fighter wings of about 72 aircraft each will be ready for deployment with the latest software and updates to the Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS), considered the ""brains"" of the aircraft.Meanwhile, its close-air-support features are still only at a basic level, and pilots who weigh less than 136 pounds are still restricted from flying the F-35 due to issues with the ejection seat that could snap a lightweight pilot's neck. The Pentagon has said it is working with Lockheed to get a fix and lift the restriction.Despite the work that still needs to be done, the plane is ready enough. Last week, Air Force officials said that the 34th Fighter Squadron, stationed at Hill Air Force Base, had reached all the milestones required for the F-35A's IOC. The fighters tested missiles in air-to-air configurations and one even hit a drone.The Air Force's IOC declaration marks another milestone for the behind-schedule and over-budget program, which has come under intense criticism in recent years.In addition to its $400 billion procurement and $1 trillion operating and maintenance price tags, doubts how the fighter matches up against other planes have come up.For example, the military blog War Is Boring reported last year that an older F-16 outmaneuvered the F-35 in an air-combat test, setting off a firestorm of criticism.But the Pentagon has since said the F-35 wasn't equipped with its full array of avionics, helmet mounted display, or compete stealth coatings. It also tried to downplay dogfighting, saying that's not the F-35's main mission.Another fifth-generation stealth fighter, the F-22, was designated primarily as an air superiority fighter. But it was canceled less than halfway into its production run as costs soared, leaving the Air Force with only 187 operational planes.On Tuesday, Carlisle alluded to those differences in the two fighter jets.""The F-35 is the best air-to air-airplane in the world except for the F-22, and the F-22 is the best air-to-ground airplane in the world except for the F-35,"" he said. ""When you look at the primary mission of the F-35, its ability to do the air-to-ground role across missions is the best capability airplane out there today. But it's not the F-22 in respect to maneuverability.""Related:What It's Really Like To Fly The F-35: A Marine Pilot Speaks

273,NOC,"With most of the Pentagon's large aircraft contracts already awarded, Boeing (BA), Lockheed Martin (LMT), Northrop Grumman (NOC) and other defense contractors are turning their sights to missile contracts that could be worth more than $90 billion.On Friday, the Air Force released its requests for proposals for a Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD) intercontinental ballistic missile to replace Boeing's aging Minuteman system, and a Long-Range Standoff (LRSO) nuclear cruise missile to replace Boeing AGM-86B Air-Launched Cruise Missiles.The GBSD's estimated cost is $62 billion over 30 years. The LRSO's cost has been estimated at $20 billion-$30 billion.Boeing officials were bullish in a recent interview with IBD that they would win the award for the GBSD, based on past work in the field.""We are confident the Air Force can rely on us, given our proven commitment,"" said Rich Choppa, director of global sales and marketing at Boeing's defense unit. ""We are just as committed to developing a new system as we were back in 1958 when we developed the Minuteman system that stood the test of time.""Choppa said Boeing was looking forward to turning in a proposal to the Air Force in 72 days.Other potential prime contractors for the Minuteman upgrade include Lockheed and Northrop. Some 37 other contractors are bidding on subcontractor work.Boeing shares were down 1.2% on the stock market today. Lockheed rose 0.85%, and Northrop added 0.9%.IBD'S TAKE: Several defense firms are in buy range after strong earnings results. See how Lockheed's shares stack up against others in the group on Stock Checkup.  The missile contracts come after the Pentagon awarded the last major aircraft deal expected for the next decade.In October, Northrop won a contract to build new strategic bombers to replace Cold War-era Boeing B-52s, beating a Boeing-Lockheed team. The bomber deal is estimated to be worth $50 billion-$80 billion.New fighters will be procured via the F-35 contract, which Lockheed won in 2001. The Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps will buy a combined 2,443 aircraft, with another 900 expected to be bought by U.S. allies. Northrop is a major subcontractor.Meanwhile, production on other fighter jets, including Boeing's F/A-18 Super Hornet and its F-15, will shut down in the next several years, though additional orders from foreign customers could extend the production line a few more years.Boeing is developing the KC-46 tanker, which is based on its 767 commercial passenger jet, for the Air Force, though it has run into delays and major cost overruns.

274,NOC,"Raytheon (RTN) joined Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Northrop Grumman (NOC) in boosting its earnings outlook, as defense budgets improve and global conflicts spur demand for weapons.Raytheon now sees full-year earnings from continuing operations of $7.13-$7.33 a share, up from a prior view of $6.93-$7.13. Analysts project EPS of $7.18.Earnings from continuing operations, excluding certain one-time gains, rose 12% to $1.85 per share. Analysts were expecting $1.74. Revenue climbed 3% to $6 billion, above views for $5.8 billion.Raytheon shares ended trading up 2% to 138.06 on the stock market today, putting them near their record high reached earlier in the month. Lockheed edged up 0.15% to 254.55 while Northrop lost 0.3% to 217.23.IBD'S TAKE: Defense stocks have been strong, with Raytheon, Lockheed and Northrop hitting buy points in recent weeks. See how their shares stack up against others in the group on Stock Checkup.Revenue at Raytheon's missile systems division jumped 6% to $1.66 billion on higher sales of its Paveway laser-guided bomb system. Smart bombs are in high demand by the Air Force and U.S. allies in the fight against ISIS.Sales at its integrated defense systems unit, which includes the Patriot air-defense system, dropped 11% to $1.4 billion, though Raytheon has seen an uptick in foreign Patriot demand. During Q2, the company booked $487 million to provide Patriot capabilities for Kuwait.Sales at Raytheon's intelligence, information and services segment climbed 3% to $1.64 billion.RELATED:Lockheed Stock Gives Up Some Gains On F-35 Funding Concerns Northrop Technology Services Sales Dip Weighs On Q2 Earnings Results.

275,NOC,"Northrop Grumman (NOC) reported second-quarter earnings and revenue gains Wednesday that were stronger than expected, and the company raised its full-year 2016 earnings guidance.But it also recorded a drop in technology service sales that impacted its profit margin, driving its share price down early Wednesday.Earnings rose 4% to $2.85 a share, beating analyst consensus by 32 cents a share. It's topped earnings estimates eight quarters in a row. Revenue grew 1.8% to $6 billion, edging forecasts of $5.99 billion. The Falls Church, Va.-based aerospace systems maker and military contractor lifted its 2016 earnings guidance to a range of $10.75-$11 a share, up from $10.40-$10.70 earlier, well above analyst consensus for $10.70.Northrop said second-quarter operating income declined 2% to $731 million and operating margin was down 50 basis points at 13.3%. Lower operating income reflected a decline in segment operating income and lower net pension adjustments than in the prior year period, the company said.IBD'S TAKE: Highly rated aerospace/defense systems maker Northrop Grumman rose above a first stage flat base with a 218.94 entry point, rising to 223.11, on June 30. To see how it compares with other big aerospace and defense contractors check out the IBD Stock Checkup.On Jan. 1, Northrop realigned from four to three business segments: aerospace systems, mission systems and technology services. During the quarter, aerospace systems sales rose 4% to $2.6 billion, while mission systems was up 2% at $2.69 billion. Technology services declined 2% to $1.21 billion.Northrop Grumman shares were down fractionally to 217.81 by the close on the stock market today. Its stock is up about 15% year-to-date and it has an 83 IBD Composite Rating, meaning it's outperformed 83% of all stocks on key metrics such as sales and profit growth.Another aerospace firm reporting earnings, General Dynamics (GD), said second-quarter adjusted earnings rose 8% to $2.44 a share, beating estimates by 13 cents. Revenue fell 2.8% to $7.67 billion, missing Wall Street's $7.87 billion target amid lower sales in its combat systems and aerospace business.General Dynamics said it expects business jet activity to recover in the second half of 2016 and raised its full-year earnings guidance to $9.70 a share, up from $9.20 earlier and well above analyst consensus for $9.52.General Dynamics shares climbed 1.5% to 146.63 at the close. Among other leading aerospace/defense companies, Lockheed Martin (LMT) slipped 0.2% to 254.16 while Raytheon (RTN) shaved a nickel off its shares to close at 135.34. Boeing (BA) was up 0.8% to 135.96, and B/E Aerospace (BEAV) climbed 2% to 49.18.

That is a pricing cut of $1.30 from August, the biggest drop since November, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.The U.S. oil drilling rig count climbed by 3 to 374, the highest level since March, Baker Hughes said Friday. The nation's crude inventories rose to 521.1 million barrels through July 22, keeping supplies more than 100 million barrels above the five-year average, Energy Information Administration data show.Demand for crude is set to decline in the next few months. U.S. refineries typically reduce operating rates to perform seasonal maintenance as the summer driving season comes to an end, after the Labor Day holiday in early September.""I think the market is going down in anticipation that summer is about to come to an end,"" said Bill O'Grady, chief market strategist at Confluence Investment Management in St. Louis, which oversees $4.9 billion.

277,NOC,"President-elect Donald Trump tweeted late Thursday that he has asked Boeing (BA) for a price on F/A-18 Super Hornets, citing the cost of Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35.Based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns of the Lockheed Martin F-35, I have asked Boeing to price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 22, 2016Shares of Lockheed were down 2% in late trading on the stock market today, after closing up 0.1% in the regular session. Boeing edged up 0.7% late. Northrop Grumman (NOC) and United Technologies (UTX), which are major F-35 subcontractors, lost about 1%.Earlier this month, Lockheed and Boeing were targets of Trump, who called the F-35's costs ""out of control"" and vowed to cancel Boeing's Air Force One replacement jets due to the cost.The CEOs of both companies met with Trump on Wednesday, and Boeing promised to keep the cost of the Air Force One program below $4 billion.On Monday, the F-35's program office told reporters that costs for the next batch of jets will be down ""significantly."" The Pentagon plans to negotiate prices for the 10th lot of F-35s, with the cost for each variant seen coming down 6%-7%, said Lt. Gen. Christopher Bogdan, the Defense Department's F-35 program manager.The cost to develop and build the F-35 is about $400 billion, and the program is perennially under fire for cost overruns and delays. The Pentagon is buying more than 2,400 F-35s for the Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps, and U.S. allies will buy hundreds more.With its stealth technology and advanced system integration and avionics, the F-35 is considered a ""fifth generation"" fighter, while the Super Hornet lacks stealth technology and is considered a fourth generation fighter.Boeing's export opportunities for the Super Hornet have been challenged as countries wait for the more advanced F-35. But last month Canada said it is buying 18 Super Hornets as a stopgap measure after backing away from a decision to buy the F-35 and, instead, restarting a fighter competition. Kuwait is also buying 32 Super Hornets, while Israel added to its F-35 purchase.

278,NOC,"President-elect Donald Trump appeared to challenge Russia to a nuclear arms race Friday after tweeting Thursday that the U.S. must strengthen its nuclear arsenal.During a phone interview with MSNBC, he said, ""Let it be an arms race. We will outmatch them at every pass and outlast them all,"" according to ""Morning Joe"" co-host Mika Brzezinski.A Trump spokesman has since tried to downplay the remark.His latest comment also followed a nuclear call to arms Thursday from Russian President Vladimir Putin, who is seeking missiles that can evade countermeasures.""We need to strengthen the strategic nuclear forces, for that we should develop missiles capable of penetrating any current and prospective missile defense systems,"" Putin said at a defense ministry meeting, according to Tass news agency.On Friday, he said during a news conference, ""We will never get dragged into an arms race where we spend resources that we can't afford.""America's nuclear triad of air-, land- and sea-based delivery systems is nearing the end of its life span and needs to be replaced. But that won't come cheaply.Over the summer, the Air Force released its requests for proposals for intercontinental ballistic missiles to replace Boeing's aging Minuteman system. The Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent's estimated cost is $62 billion over 30 years, but a report from the Pentagon's office of independent cost assessment said the Air Force's estimate is too low by ""billions of dollars,"" sources told Bloomberg.The Air Force is also seeking Long-Range Standoff nuclear cruise missiles to replace Boeing AGM-86B Air-Launched Cruise Missiles. That program's cost has been estimated at $20 billion-$30 billion.Lockheed Martin (LMT), Northrop Grumman (NOC), Raytheon (RTN) and Boeing (BA) are expected to bid on the two contracts, and initial contracts could be awarded next year.The United States must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 22, 2016Last year, Northrop was awarded a contract to build the B-21 bomber that replaces the Cold War-era Boeing B-52s. The Air Force has put the development-phase cost for the B-21 at $23.5 billion, but analysts have estimated the total acquisition cost at up to $80 billion.The Navy's program to replace its Ohio-class submarines, which can launch nuclear missiles, will cost the service $100 billion.Lockheed shares closed down 1.3% on the stock market today. Northrop dipped 0.3%, Raytheon ended flat, and Boeing gained 0.2%. General Dynamics (GD) and Huntington Ingalls (HII), which build submarines, finished up 0.4% and down 0.5%, respectively.Trump's affirmation of U.S. nuclear capabilities comes a year after appearing to be stumped by a question on his priorities for the triad and follows recent criticism on the cost of Lockheed's $400 billion F-35 program and Boeing's Air Force One replacement planes.Late Thursday, Trump tweeted that he has asked Boeing to price out F/A-18 Super Hornets, citing the cost of Lockheed's F-35.
"
279,NOC,"ARLINGTON, Va. — President-elect Donald Trump has Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 in his cross hairs as an example of ""out of control"" costs at the Pentagon, but the Joint Strike Fighter's program office said Monday that costs for the next batch of jets will be down ""significantly.""Lt. Gen. Christopher Bogdan, the Defense Department's F-35 program manager, said Trump's transition team hadn't been briefed by the program office before his tweet about the cost last week. The team has since called to ask more about it, but a meeting hasn't been ""fully scheduled yet.""""I have no doubt that given the controversy over the F-35 program over the years that there is a perception the program is out of control as the first F-35s cost twice as much as we thought they were going to. That's in the past,"" Bogdan told reporters at a briefing.If given the chance to speak to Trump, he would give ""the good, the bad and the ugly"" about the $400 billion stealth fighter program.Under last month's $6.1. billion contract with Lockheed for the ninth batch of 57 F-35s, the cost for the Air Force's A model fell 5.5% to $102.1 million vs. the eighth lot, and the Marines' B model fell 1.8% to $131.6 million.But the Navy's C model rose 2.5% to $132.2 million as two fewer jets were ordered in lot nine.The Pentagon plans to negotiate prices for the 10th lot of F-35s, with the cost for each variant seen coming down 6%-7%, Bogdan said.Meanwhile, updating the Autonomic Logistics Information System, the so called brains of the plane, has been ""harder than expected,"" he added.The software will be fielded in February, two months later than anticipated, and issues with insulation on coolant lines have caused production to slow down and won't be caught up until August 2017.Lockheed shares closed up 0.8% on the stock market today. Shares of United Technologies (UTX), whose Pratt and Whitney division makes the engines for the fighter, rose 2% on an analyst upgrade. Northrop Grumman (NOC), a key subcontractor on the F-35, edged up 0.8%.IBD'S TAKE: The F-35 wasn't the only program to come under fire from Trump. He first threatened to cancel Boeing's Air Force One program.Despite Monday's gains, shares of Lockheed, Northrop and Raytheon (RTN) have yet to recover from Trump's F-35 criticism last week, as analysts see high-profile weapons programs coming under more scrutiny.Earlier Monday at an Atlantic Council event, Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James said she had met with the transition team and explained that ""it's not quite as easy as it seems to get these costs down,"" according to reports.RELATED:Navy Faces Carrier Jet Shortfall, Reportedly Looking At More Super HornetsIsrael Thinks Lockheed F-35s Are Still Awesome, Will Buy More

280,NOC,"Northrop Grumman's (NOC) program to develop an upgraded, cyber-hardened network for major air operations has almost doubled in cost and a key deadline has slipped by more than three years, according to the U.S. Air Force.The development phase of the network is now estimated to cost $745 million, up from the original $374 million, according to a ""Critical Change Report"" submitted to Congress last week and obtained by Bloomberg News. Including procurement and support, the system — for use in air operations centers to orchestrate combat, counterterrorism and humanitarian missions — has a projected price tag of $2.98 billion.The Air Force has set December 2019 as the date to decide whether to fully deploy the AOC 10.2 system worldwide, according to the report. That's 41 months past the original July 2016 decision date. Meeting the new deadline depends on the system passing tests that have been marred so far by defects.The air-operations network ""is essential to national security,"" according to the report, and must be modernized ""to address today's evolving cyber environment,"" command-and-control mission changes ""and accelerating technological advancements.""Northrop has said the new system will convert ""raw data into actionable information that is used to direct battlefield activities."" The current version, deployed globally since 2006, is a conglomeration of 43 software applications.For Northrop, picked by the Air Force last year to develop its new $80 billion Long-Range Strike Bomber, the overrun and delays on the air-support network could undercut its prospects in future defense competitions because past performance is often among the criteria in the selection process.The Air Force issued notices about unsatisfactory performance to the Falls Church, Va.-based contractor in 2014 and 2015. The program's troubles also were used in the Air Force's official performance assessment report of Northrop in 2015, the service said in a statement.Northrop ""initially placed insufficient priority on information assurance requirements, and, coupled with a slow staffing"" increase, that ""resulted in the program falling behind schedule,"" according to the Air Force report.""While there have been some challenges,"" the company and the Air Force ""have forged a strong partnership that is working together to address the issues"" facing the system, Northrop spokesman Randy Belote said in an email. ""Northrop Grumman is dedicated to ensuring that the AOC 10.2 successfully provides for the security of the system including against future threats it will face.""For its part, the Air Force ""underestimated the complexity of integrating numerous third-party"" software applications and information assurance requirements, and didn't budget enough money, according to the service's report.That ""put the program in a situation where the required content could not be completed within the program's original schedule and funding profile,"" Captain Michael Hertzog, an Air Force spokesman, said in an email.As of early August, Northrop had fixed 102 ""urgent"" problem reports, leaving 116 open ones that the company must fix, according to Major Jeremiah B.B. Sanders, the Air Force's program manager for the system.Sanders said Northrop Grumman is on an incentive-fee type contract, so its profit will be reduced by a percentage of the overrun.Shares of Northrop Grumman ended trading Wednesday down 0.9% to 249.65.
"
281,NOC,"Boeing (BA) plans to reduce its commercial-aircraft workforce by 8% by the end of this year with more reductions coming next year, according to reports of a company memo, as European rival Airbus (EADSY) grabs market share.That also comes a week after the aerospace giant announced a 30% dividend hike and a $14 billion stock buyback program.Boeing had signaled earlier this year that it would cut about 4.8% from the commercial division this year, with management reportedly telling workers that the Airbus A321neo was ""stealing massive orders from the 737,"" which makes up the bulk of Boeing's sales.The 8% cut this year, which includes a 10% reduction of executives and managers, was billed as a way to increase overall competitiveness, Reuters reported.The 2017 reduction is expected to be voluntary but Boeing could resort to involuntary cuts, according to Dow Jones.Boeing shares finished 1.1% higher at 156.18 on the stock market today, rising further above buy range after an October breakout.The layoffs come amid several changes for Boeing. Last month, the company named Kevin McAllister, a 27-year veteran of General Electric's (GE) aviation business, to head the commercial unit.Production rates for the current-generation 777 are also set to slow as the company gears up for the 777X, and demand for the 747 is waning.Meanwhile, Boeing said earlier this year there's a ""realistic possibility"" it will launch a new midsize plane as well as a longer version of its 737 Max in response to the A321 neo.While that sounds like a major drain on cash, Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg told analysts at a conference that the company could do both without ""changing our R&D and capex profile"" in the next five years, according to Bloomberg.IBD'S TAKE: Delta Air Lines and Alaska Air shares are both near record highs, but the carriers will end their code-sharing alliance next April.And the election of Donald Trump has proved to be another question mark for Boeing. While the stock has rallied since Election Day, Trump's anti-trade stance could result in some blowback for Boeing's export orders, and his skepticism on big-ticket defense spending could hit Boeing's military programs.Trump has criticized plans for new Air Force One plans with Boeing and decried the cost of the F-35 fighter jet by Lockheed Martin (LMT).But shares of Pentagon contractors like Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman (NOC) and Raytheon (RTN) have suffered more, as Boeing is seen as less exposed to the defense budget.Northrop Grumman, Lockheed and Raytheon shares rose 0.8%.RELATED:Boeing Sets $16.6 Billion, 80-Jet Iran Air Deal, Still Curbs 777 ProductionLockheed's F-35 Isn't Stealthy Enough To Avoid Trump's Latest Attack

284,NOC,"To counter an increasingly aggressive North Korea, South Korea and the U.S. agreed late Thursday to deploy Lockheed Martin's (LMT) anti-missile system.Lockheed's Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system will be stationed in South Korea by late 2017. Washington and Seoul have been in talks about deploying THAAD since February, according to a release from the Pentagon.Lockheed shares rose 0.85% to 251.90 in the stock market today, hitting a new high. Shares are still in buy range from a 245.47 buy point.The deployment comes as North Korea test-fired mid-range ballistic missiles in June that have the capability of hitting Guam and U.S. military facilities in Okinawa, Japan. Pyongyang also has tested nuclear devices that it claimed can be loaded onto a missile.While the Pentagon said THAAD's presence in South Korea would ""be focused solely on North Korean nuclear and missile threats and would not be directed towards any third party nations,"" Russia and China oppose the move.IBD'S TAKE: Defense stocks like Lockheed have been strong despite overall economic uncertainty, with some of the top Pentagon contractors entering buy range recently. Meanwhile, companies that largely serve the commercial market haven't fared as well.Meanwhile, tensions in other parts of the world, like the Middle East, have helped boost sales of Patriot air-defense systems from Raytheon (RTN).Raytheon shares rose 0.1.1% to 138.49, setting a new high.
"
285,NOC,"Critics have said trying to develop and build Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 simultaneously is a major flaw in the program, but top officials said giving the plane to operators is ""probably the best thing"" for furthering development.Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain, top Pentagon weapons tester Michael Gilmore and others have questioned the F-35's ""concurrency."" The Government Accountability Office also said in multiple reports that high levels of concurrency were a major driver of increased costs and schedule delays.But Lt. Gen. Chris Bogdan, the F-35 program’s executive officer, told reporters late Tuesday that getting the F-35 to initial operating capability (IOC) with the Marines last year, without full war-fighting capabilities, has helped the joint program office learn more about pilot and maintenance crews' requirements and other issues with the plane.""Despite the limited capability the airplane has today, getting it in the hands of the warfighter and having them use it is probably the best thing we can do to further development,"" he said.The Air Force will weigh a similar trade-off as its version of the F-35 nears IOC. Top Pentagon procurement officer Frank Kendall said that milestone could still come between August and December.Bogdan has been a proponent of getting the plane ready for IOC by Aug. 1. But issues with the aircraft’s Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS) will drive the schedule, he said.Right now, four of the five updates will be ready in August or September, but integrating engine information into ALIS won't happen until October or November.""We presented that information to the Air Force and will let the Air Force decide what they choose to do,"" Bogdan said. ""It's entirely possible to deliver all of the deployable capabilities without the engine capability, but that's a decision the Air Force will have to make.""Sean Stackley, the Navy's acquisition chief, noted the F-35 program office can tailor ALIS updates to address specific needs from the field.""This is a case of a complex system that is maturing much quicker now that the operators have their hands on it and can point us to some things that are highest priority to them,"" he said.Lockheed shares dipped less than 0.1% on the stock market today. Northrop Grumman (NOC) and United Technologies (UTX), which are major subcontractors, fell 0.2% and rose 0.4%, respectively.
"
286,NOC,"Northrop Grumman's (NOC) new B-21 stealth bomber will likely be ""margin dilutive,"" though details on the secretive program are still sparse, according to an analyst.The Air Force has put the development cost at $23.5 billion and the per-plane cost at $564 million in 2016 dollars. Analysts have estimated the cost at up to $80 billion, but the Pentagon has been reluctant to be specific to prevent its capabilities from being inferred.RBC Capital analyst Robert Stallard suspects that the bomber will hit Northrop's margins but noted ""there is not much Northrop can say to prove or disprove this notion"" due to the classified nature of the B-21.A spokesman for the defense contractor didn't respond to a request for comment.Northrop won the bomber contract in October, beating a Boeing (BA)-Lockheed Martin (LMT) team for what is likely to be the biggest program award of the decade. The B-21 will replace Cold War-era Boeing B-52s.Stallard also downgraded Northrop's stock to sector perform from outperform, citing the highest stock value relative to earnings in more than 10 years. But he added the long-term outlook for Northrop remains positive due to an improved Defense Department budget and the ramp-up in the B-21 still ahead.Northrop shares closed down 1.4% on the stock market today.The B-21 has already drawn criticism from Capitol Hill. Sen. John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, has major issues with the Air Force's demand for cost secrecy.“Why would you not want to tell the American people how you are going to spend their dollars?” he complained a March 8 hearing.McCain is also critical of the service's use of a cost-plus contract that leaves taxpayers on the hook for any cost overruns for the initial phase.Meanwhile, Northrop will benefit from another aircraft program that has taken heavy flak, Lockheed's F-35, which is running over budget and behind schedule.The eventual start of full-rate production on the F-35 should help Northrop, a major F-35 subcontractor, offset declines on the F/A-18's production, Stallard said. Northrop builds the fuselage and some electronic components, including the mission-planning software.Stallard downgraded Lockheed stock to sector perform, noting high valuation concerns as well.Lockheed has seen an uptick in deliveries of its troublesome F-35 and operating margins should get a boost when production increases, Stallard wrote. The program is seen accounting for 30% of Lockheed sales in 2018, up from 20% of sales in 2015.Lockheed shares slipped 1.1%.
"
287,NOC,"As the Air Force readies 60-year-old B-52 bombers to prosecute the war against the Islamic State, a separate air war is looming over Congress amid opposition to the Pentagon's acquisition strategy for the B-21 bomber, which is supposed to replace the aging aircraft.Six years after an earlier attempt to update the bomber fleet was canceled due to high costs, the Defense Department awarded Northrop Grumman (NOC) the B-21 contract in October. Work was held up by a protest from the losing Boeing (BA)-Lockheed Martin (LMT) team, but the Government Accountability Office rejected it last month.Now the B-21, which could cost $50 billion-$80 billion, is taking flak from lawmakers over the Pentagon's use of a contract that leaves taxpayers on the hook for any cost overruns for the initial phase.“I remain seriously concerned about the acquisition strategy for the B-21 Long Range Strike Bomber, especially the use of a cost-plus contract for the development of this aircraft,” said Sen. John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, at a hearing earlier this month.When asked if he would use the defense authorization bill to block the contract, a McCain spokeswoman said the senator would ""consider his legislative options.""Cost-plus contracts have been used for programs -- like Lockheed's F-22 and F-35 as well as Northrop's B-2 -- that are now known for sky-high price tags. Production on the F-22 and B-2 ended early, due in part to ballooning costs.Despite McCain's concerns, the Air Force is moving ahead with its latest stealth weapon. Lt. Gen. Arnold Bunch, military deputy in Air Force acquisition, said last week that the service decided to use a cost-plus contract for development because of risks associated with building a completely new airframe.The options for the first five production lots, which include 21 aircraft, are fixed price, meaning the contractor absorbs additional costs.But Andrew Hunter, director of the Defense-Industrial Initiatives Group at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said there are also risks with using fixed-price contracts.General Dynamics’ (GD) F-111 attack aircraft, Boeing's C-17 transport aircraft, and Lockheed's C-5 transport plane were all fixed-price contracts that went well over budget, he said. The government then has no choice but to help out the industrial base or risk a ripple of bankruptcies from various suppliers, he added, drawing a comparison to the auto bailout.""Almost without an expectation, the government has had to pay extra,"" Hunter said of planes bought at fixed prices. ""The government has the decision to cancel the program and get nothing, or pay more to actually get the airplane.""Critics of the cost-plus contract point to Boeing's KC-46 refueling tanker, which is under a fixed-price contract. The aerospace giant has assumed over $800 million in after-tax charges on the plane due to higher-than-estimated engineering and manufacturing costs.But the Air Force's Bunch cautioned against comparing the B-21 with the tanker, pointing out that the KC-46 is a derivative of a commercial plane, Boeing's 767, and has potential for foreign sales. The B-21 has no commercial version and no prospects at this time for international sales to allies, he said.And while the B-21 will use mature technology, there are still risks from integrating the technology into a new plane, Bunch added.McCain also has issues with the Air Force not disclosing the full price of the bomber, though it puts the development cost at $23.5 billion and the per-plane cost at $564 million in 2016 dollars.""Why would you not want to tell the American people how you are going to spend their dollars?"" he asked March 8.The Air Force countered by saying it doesn't want enemies inferring the plane's capabilities based on price.But the B-21 isn't so secret that the Air Force can't disclose the identities of top subcontractors, who can help build more political support among lawmakers seeking Pentagon spending for their states and districts.They include United Technologies’ (UTX) Pratt & Whitney, BAE Systems and Rockwell Collins (COL).Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., a member of the Senate’s Appropriations Committee, said last week that he was pleased that the engines would be built at a factory in his home state, and Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., who is a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, echoed his sentiments.McCain's House counterpart, Rep. Mac Thornberry, R-Texas, told reporters earlier this month that he would like to see more mature technology on big-ticket programs, lowering the risk and need for cost-plus contracts. But he didn't voice a stance on the B-21 contract.Air Force Secretary Deborah James said the service will continue to “communicate” with Congress about the contract, as the B-21 “is a capability we need for the country.” The Air Force estimates an initial operational capability in the mid-2020s.While the B-2 is a stealth plane, it still lights up radars on Capitol Hill and in the Pentagon, as it looms over the latest bomber contract. Considered a poster child for Pentagon overspending, only 21 B-2s were built at a cost of more than $2 billion each.But James said she's learned from the B-2's failures, and the Air Force is taking a different approach with the B-21 this time.“The B-2 remained in the shadows for too long,"" she said. ""Too many details remained classified too long.""

290,NOC,"Lockheed Martin (LMT) became the latest company to come under attack by President-elect Donald Trump, who criticized the defense giant's F-35 stealth fighter program for having ""out of control"" costs.It came a week after he vowed to cancel Boeing's (BA) Air Force One replacement planes, citing the cost.The cost to develop and build the F-35 is about $400 billion, and the program is perennially under fire for cost overruns and delays. The Pentagon is buying more than 2,400 F-35s for the Air Fore, Navy and Marine Corps, and U.S. allies will buy hundreds more.In a tweet Monday, Trump was hammered to program for escalating expenses.The F-35 program and cost is out of control. Billions of dollars can and will be saved on military (and other) purchases after January 20th.— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 12, 2016In an appearance on Fox News Sunday, Trump reiterated his attack on Boeing and said the F-35's cost is ""out of control.""""We welcome the opportunity to address any questions the president-elect has about the program,"" said Jeff Babione, Lockheed's F-35 general manager, on Monday.He added that the company has reduced the price by more than 70% and predicted it will reach $85 million per plane by 2019-2020. In addition to the acquisition cost, Lockheed is also working on reducing the F-35's operating and sustainment costs, he said.Shares of Lockheed fell 2.4% to 253.23 on the stock market today, but rebounding from a low of 245.50 and closing above their 50-day average.

""Presumably he won't comment on all defense contracts but will focus on high profile programs. However, given his power as president, this can have an impact on specific programs.""But even if Trump restricts himself to a ""bombastic Twitter shoutout,"" a tougher stance could still affect defense stocks, Cowen added.Among other defense giants, Raytheon (RTN) was down 1.7% Monday, closing above its 50-day.

294,NOC,"WASHINGTON, D.C.- The Air Force's  Chief of Staff is ""pretty confident"" that the Air Force's variant of Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 will meet its target date for combat readiness, but trouble with the engine's integration remains a major issue.At a House Appropriations Committee hearing Wednesday,  Gen. Mark Welsh said that while he sees the F-35A variant meeting its target initial operational capability (IOC) timeframe of Aug.1 to the end of the year, the plane still has some problems.The biggest issue right now is getting the engine data incorporated into the plane's Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS) as the parts come from two different contractors. ALIS, which helps manage diagnostics, maintenance and supply-chain issues, is managed by Lockheed while the engine is built by United Technologies' (UTX) Pratt & Whitney.Welsh said he expects to have the data integrated in July, giving the service a month to see how it works in operations before the IOC window opens.Lockheed shares fell 0.4%  to 217.20 in the stock market today. United Technologies shares edged up 0.5% to 95.53.Also Lockheed is working ""24/7"" on fixing problems with the fighter's software including radar stability issues, Welsh said.Last month, Lt. Gen. Chris Bogdan, the F-35 program’s executive officer, said that issues with how the software in the F-35’s sensors works with the main computer are a concern and if they aren't improved by the end of May, the Air Force might have to push back the IOC target date.Welsh said that Lockheed developed a change to fix the problem in the labs last month and will put it in the platform this month.The Air Force isn't the only service to have continued issues with the problematic F-35.At a House Appropriations Committee hearing Tuesday, Gen. Robert Neller, Marine Corps Commandant,  said that he has “concerns about where the software was” and wants Lockheed to “go faster.”  But Neller is still confident in the aircraft, saying it will get better as development continues and that his pilots are “very positive and very excited” about the plane.Still the Air Force has been hitting necessary milestones with the F-35 before IOC.  The service said that the F-35A dropped bombs for the first time in training last week at Hill Air Force Base in Utah.As for the Air Force's new B-21 bomber, Welsh didn't have any updates as to when more information about the engine maker and other subcontractors would be announced. Last week Secretary of the Air Force Deborah James said that more details would be announced in the coming weeks.Northrop Grumman (NOC) won bomber deal in October over a Boeing (BA)-Lockheed team, but few details have been released about the secretive program.Northrop shares fell 0.3% to 193.32. Boeing shares were down 0.3% to 119.65.

295,NOC,"Boeing (BA) said it will mull its ""next steps"" after the government rejected the company's protest over the long-range strike bomber contract, which was awarded to Northrop Grumman (NOC) last fall.The Government Accountability Office (GAO) said Tuesday it found ""no basis"" to sustain or uphold the challenge.""In denying Boeing’s protest, GAO concluded that the technical evaluation, and the evaluation of costs, was reasonable, consistent, and in accordance with procurement laws and regulations,"" according to a statement.Boeing said in a statement that it still believes its bid was the best solution, adding ""We will carefully review the GAO's decision and decide upon our next steps with regard to the protest in the coming days.""Mark Bobbi, an aerospace, defense and security analyst at consultancy IHS, said Boeing could still go to court, noting that Lockheed Martin (LMT) sued the Pentagon in December to stop work on the $6.75 billion joint light tactical vehicle contract that was awarded to Oshkosh (OSK).Because of the secretive nature of the bomber program, the details of Boeing's protest and the GAO's reasons for denying it are classified and won't be disclosed to the public.Northrop won the bomber deal in October, but Boeing and teammate Lockheed Martingissued a formal protest soon after, saying the Air Force’s decision was “fundamentally flawed.”The Air Force has plans to buy 80 to 100 of the new planes, in a contract that could be worth $50 billion to $80 billion, to replace the decades-old Boeing B-52 bombers.Northrop shares rallied 1.6% in the stock market today. Boeing shares climbed 3.65%. Lockheed shares rose 1.4%.Prospects for the protest got a new twist last week, when the Air Force announced that Richard Lombardi, the Air Force’s principal deputy assistant secretary for acquisition, previously hadn’t listed his wife’s Northrop retirement account in his annual financial disclosure form.But Air Force Secretary Deborah James said Friday that ""my staff has also reviewed all the information and documentation and tells me that Mr. Lombardi was certainly not part of the source selection -- was not an SAE (service acquisition executive) at the time this happened.”Northrop had to stop work on the bomber until after the ruling on Boeing’s protest. In a statement Tuesday, the company said it will get back to work on the aircraft.

298,NOC,"ARLINGTON, Va. -- The Government Accountability Office is expected to rule soon on a dispute over the Pentagon's award of the long-range bomber contract to Northrop Grumman (NOC), but a recent financial disclosure by an Air Force acquisition official could delay that.A Boeing (BA)-Lockheed Martin (LMT) team that lost the bid had filed a protest soon after Northrop won the contract last fall.But Boeing could amend its protest to include Richard Lombardi, the Air Force's principal deputy assistant secretary for acquisition, who previously hadn't listed his wife's Northrop retirement account in his annual financial disclosure form.A Boeing spokesperson said the company has no comment at this time.On Thursday, the Air Force said it reassigned Lombardi to another position to help wounded veterans.At an Air Force Association breakfast Friday, Air Force Secretary Deborah James said she is ""really not able to answer"" questions about whether Boeing would alter its protest with the information.James was notified of the Lombardi's disclosure on Feb.3, reassigned him Feb. 4 and referred the issue to the Pentagon's inspector general.""It's in the hands of the (inspector general), so this will all be thoroughly reviewed,"" she said. ""My staff has also reviewed all the information and documentation and tells me that Mr. Lombardi was certainly not part of the source selection -- was not an SAE (service acquisition executive) at the time this happened.""Northrop won the bomber award in October, but the Boeing team issued a formal protest, saying the Air Force’s decision was “fundamentally flawed.” Due to the secretive nature of the program, details as to exactly why Northrop won the award won’t be released to the public.Northrop had to stop work on the bomber until after the ruling on Boeing's protest.The Air Force has plans to buy 80 to 100 of the new planes, in a contract that could be worth $50 billion to $80 billion, to replace the decades-old Boeing B-52 bombers.Boeing shares were up 0.2% in the stock market today. Lockheed shares dipped 0.5%, and Northrop shares were down 1.45%.
"
299,NOC,"The Pentagon is requesting more money in the fiscal 2017 budget to fight the Islamic State and address rising tensions with Russia and China, meaning less money to spend on Lockheed Martin's (LMT) new F-35 stealth fighters, so that older planes like the A-10 will stay in service longer.The Defense Department asked for $582.7 billion in military funding, with $523.9 billion in base budget funding and $58.8 billion in overseas contingency operations funding.The main military request is up 0.4% from the 2016 budget of $580.3 billion, but weapons procurement is 6% lower, while research and development spending is 4% higher.The request for anti-Islamic State efforts got a 50% hike to $7.5 billion, and the European Reassurance Initiative, which provides military support to Europe, would rise by $800 million to $3.4 billion.The Air Force would get $166.9 billion, up from $161 billion last year, and would delay retiring the A-10 for least two more years to focus on fighting the Islamic State. The service deferred five F-35A aircraft in the request.The budget includes requests for 63 total F-35s, 70 in 2018 and 80 in 2019, but the major boost in orders won't come until 105 are ordered in 2021.Despite the bump in spending, the Air Force doesn't think it has the funds for long-term threats.""Budget uncertainty has complicated our ability to execute this long-term plan,"" the Air Force said on its budget webpage, leaked ahead of the official budget release according to a Breaking Defense report.""The Air Force is facing a modernization bow wave in critical nuclear and space programs over the next 10 years that, under current funding levels, we simply cannot afford,"" it said.Lockheed shares closed up 0.7% in the stock market today.The budget also included $1.4 billion for the development of the long-range strike bomber. Boeing (BA) and teammate Lockheed are formally protesting the Air Force’s decision to award the long-range strike bomber contract to Northrop Grumman (NOC). A decision is expected later this month.Boeing shares lost 0.5%. Northrop shares improved by 0.9%.The budget proposal also includes $3.1 billion for 15 Boeing KC-46A Pegasus refueling tankers.The Navy's budget, meanwhile, will fall to $164.9 billion from $168.8 billion and will include $89 million to start a drone program, which has changed focus to refueling and surveillance vs. major strike capability.The Army's funding will increase to $148 billion from $146.9 billion.Looking ahead, the Pentagon is mapping out a 2018 budget of $556.7 billion, $564.8 billion in 2019, $570.4 billion in 2020, $585.2 billion in 2021.

"
304,NOC,"Lockheed Martin (LMT), Raytheon (RTN), General Dynamics (GD) and other defense stocks enjoyed a furious rally last week after the presidential election. Donald Trump had vowed to beef up military spending on the campaign trail, while lower corporate tax rates could also be a boon.Defense shares are holding steady or pulling back modestly in lighter volume. But that could offer new buying opportunities for investors. Keep in mind that new defense spending may not materialize. And if Pentagon spending does increase, that doesn't mean all defense firms, or stocks, will be winners.Lockheed Martin fell 7 cents to 263.28 on the stock market today after falling 1% to 263.35 Wednesday. Lockheed reversed from an all-time intraday high of 269.74 Tuesday.The defense giant, maker of the F-35 stealth fighter jet, closed at 267.24 on Monday, just above a 267.03 buy point in a cup-without-handle base. Such patterns can work, but the odds are less than cup bases with a handle. Handles offer an opportunity to shake out weak holders, so when the stock clears the pivot, big institutions have to bid up prices to get holders to part with their shares.Lockheed could be forming a handle, but that would need a few more days to develop. Until then, the 267.03 entry point holds.L3 Communications (LLL), like Lockheed, raced up to hit a buy point on Monday, though it didn't close above that 154.18 level. L3 fell 0.3% to 149.97 Thursday, its third straight modest decline. Like Lockheed, it could be working on a handle, but it's not ready yet.The maker of military communications and surveillance gear plunged 7.4% on Oct. 27 after its latest earnings report. Shares continued to slide to a low of 132.38 on Nov. 3, below the 200-day line. But L3 raced straight back up, spiking 12% last week.IBD'S TAKE: Bank stocks have been huge winners since the presidential election. They too are pulling back. But bank stock charts still look great.Raytheon fell 0.8% to 144.96, its third straight modest loss. It's still in buy range from a 143.49 entry point.Raytheon broke out on Nov. 9, after the presidential election, hitting a record 152.58 intraday before settling at a 7.5% gain to 146.71.Northrop Grumman dipped 0.3% to 244.66 Thursday after modest losses in the prior two sessions.Northrop broke past a 224.22 buy point on Oct. 27, following its earnings report. Shares then traded in a tight range before exploding following Trump's win, pushing the stock out of buy range. After a stock is more than 5% extended from the pivot, investors should avoid chasing it. But Northrop could pull back into range, which extends up to 235.43.General Dynamics edged down 0.1% to 165.63, its third straight modest decline. It's still slightly extended from buy range.General Dynamics gapped higher on Nov. 9, blasting above a 157.07 pivot from a short consolidation. The chase zone reaches to 164.92, so keep an eye on further pullbacks.Boeing (BA) fell 0.8% to 145.33, moving further into buying range after dipping barely into a proper entry zone on Wednesday. Boeing has a 139.55 buy point in a flat base, in range up to 146.53. Boeing cleared the entry point on Oct. 26 following Q3 earnings.Boeing remains focused mostly on civilian aircraft, but it's still a big Pentagon contractor.Here is a weekly chart:RELATED:Raytheon Launched Into Buy Range On Trump Win, Defense Stocks RallyLockheed, Northrop Price Targets HikedTrump Wants To Beef Up Military, But Funding Could Be The Enemy
"
305,NOC,"Raytheon (RTN) shares soared into buy range Wednesday as defense contractors took flight on the wings of Donald Trump's victory in the U.S. presidential election but sales to foreign countries could take a hit.On the campaign trail, Trump said he would boost military spending to make sure older equipment is replaced, increase the number of troops in the military and called for removing the sequester, but he hasn't gone into detail on how he will accomplish his goal.Raytheon shares jumped 7.5% to 146.71 on the stock market today, surpassing its buy point of 143.49.Northrop Grumman (NOC) shares climbed 5.4% to 242.30, propelled out of buy range.Lockheed Martin (LMT) shares soared 6% to 253.46, consolidating in a flat base with a buy point of 267.03.During the campaign, Trump declared the North Atlantic Treaty Organization obsolete and told allies that America wouldn't foot the bill for their defense any longer, sending shares of U.K.'s BAE Systems higher on the London exchange. He also promised to take an ""America first"" attitude, implicating isolationist policies could weaken arms sales to allies.""We might see a lot of European or Asian partners procuring from other sources,"" said Richard Pettibone, aerospace and defense analyst at Forecast International.IBD'S TAKE: While Raytheon has moved into buy range with the election of Trump, it's only the 15th-ranked stock in IBD's Aerospace/Defense Group. Atop the list is Heico (HEIA), which makes jet engine parts. Partners will stay put on Lockheed's F-35 program but Lockheed's F-16 could lose its front-runner status as India looks to buy more jets. Lockheed offered attractive incentives to New Delhi, like tech transfers and in August the company said it would move its F-16 manufacturing to India.""But with an isolationist policy, you're not going to give them more tech transfers,"" Pettibone said.Instead India could order more jets from France's Dassault, Sweden's Saab or offerings from Russian firms.RELATED: Despite Closer Russia Ties, Turkey Orders More F-35s; China Debuts J-20Pentagon Finalizes $6 Billion Lockheed Contract For 57 F-35s

"
315,NOC,"When a market becomes mature and commoditized — the way much of the semiconductor market is — one way to kick growth into higher gear is to find an advanced niche where there's little competition.That's the route Macom Technology Solutions (MTSI) has taken to turn its financial performance around.The company long has supplied semiconductors to mature markets, such as automotive navigation systems. But most of its growth is expected to come from advanced applications for the communications and defense industries, where customers include big tech names such as Cisco (CSCO) and leading military suppliers like Northrop Grumman (NOC).Because of the advanced technologies involved with it, it's not a niche just any company can enter.""Our recipe for growth is identifying areas of new technologies, new materials and new markets that require our technology,"" Chief Executive John Croteau told Investor's Business Daily.While mainstream semiconductor companies such as Intel (INTC) and Texas Instruments (TXN) have struggled with sluggish revenue growth for several years, Macom has run off five straight quarters of double-digit sales gains.Gains Of 20%Macom has boosted revenue at least 20% the past four quarters. Compare that with the preceding 12, when Macom logged only one quarter of double-digit revenue growth accompanied by five quarters of declines.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Macom's annual earnings to grow 52% this fiscal year and 30% next year. The company's stock price trades near 43 and is up more than 50% since Aug. 24.""Specialized design capabilities and proprietary, advanced manufacturing processes allow Macom to maintain high barriers to entry,"" JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur noted in a recent research report.Macom makes semiconductor products that cover high-speed optical, satellite, radar, wired and wireless networks. Their products can be found in automotive, industrial, medical and mobile devices.Macom gear also will show up in unusual places. It recently won a technical Emmy award for providing video switching gear.But Macom operates in a pretty narrow sector of the semiconductor market, says Croteau.""It's a relatively esoteric niche,"" he said. ""We specialize in very high-performance semiconductors designed to achieve everything from radio frequency to lasers. This is not your mainstream commodity semiconductor business.""Optical NetworkingThe first growth market Macom identified was optical networking. In this market, the firm's portfolio includes components for optical communications that range from data center networks to long-haul and metro core networks designed to accommodate a wide area.Part of Macom's growth in the market for optical fiber networks is expected to come from China, where Croteau said the company has ""established a strong position.""Fi-Best BuyThat position was strengthened further earlier this month, when Macom closed its acquisition of FiBest, a supplier of optical subassemblies, in nearby Japan.Croteau says the deal gives Macom a new sales channel in an estimated $500 million radio-frequency and microwave-component market in Japan, plus easier access to China's market.""You need to have a strong channel in position, and one of the secondary benefits of the FiBest buyout is that it establishes an indigenous position in Japan where we are able to service China,"" he said.Another growth area is the market for gallium nitride semiconductors used in bright, light-emitting diodes, where Croteau says the company has established a leadership position in terms of commercializing next-generation technology.A third area of growth is in radar systems, where Macom and MIT's Lincoln Laboratory — a federally funded research and development center — are jointly developing a multifunction phased-array radar panel designed for civil and military radar applications.""It's a new way to build defense and civil radar,"" Croteau said.He says each of these three growth areas — optical, gallium nitride and radar — has the potential to double Macom's size.Expanding Via AcquisitionsMeanwhile, Macom has used buyouts to expand into new markets and product areas. Its latest deal came Dec. 14, when it announced the acquisition of Aeroflex's diode business for $38 million in cash.JPMorgan's Sur said in a note to client the deal helps Macom's leadership position in radio frequency and microwave diodes, rectifiers and power transistors.""Aeroflex is currently the second-largest supplier of (radio frequency) and microwave diodes and is a large player in the high-reliability rectifiers and power transistors (radio frequency) and microwave business,"" Sur said.Macom, however, will slow its acquisition pace in 2016, Croteau said: ""We are now at the stage where 100% of the challenge before us is operational and execution. It's a lot of work — being able to double, triple or quadruple your output is not a trivial task. The right thing to do now is focus on that rather than M&A.""While Macom itself would make a logical acquisition target for a larger semiconductor company, Croteau doesn't expect the company to be gobbled up soon.""You hear a lot of chatter about Macom being the last one standing in the space, which makes us a potential target for acquisition,"" he said. ""But we operate in a space that is really not considered to be a primary area of focus for the guys with deep pockets. If what we did was important to them, they probably would have (acquired us) a long time ago. So we would expect to still be Macom five years from now.""

393,NOC,"Northrop Grumman (NOC) reported strong third-quarter results and raised its full year earnings outlook Wednesday, a day after winning a lucrative bomber contract from the Air Force over Boeing (BA) and Lockheed Martin (LMT). Fellow defense contractor General Dynamics (GD) also topped earnings views.Northrop Grumman's Q3 earnings per diluted share jumped 22% to $2.75. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters were expecting $2.19. Revenue was flat at $5.98 billion, above views for $5.86 billion.Northrop raised its full-year EPS outlook to $9.70 to $9.80, up from prior guidance of $9.55 to $9.70. Northrop also raised the low end of its 2016 revenue guidance.Shares jumped 5.5% to close at 190.50 on the stock market today. The stock has several record highs in recent sessions.The company was flying high after hours Tuesday after beating out a Boeing-Lockheed Martin team for the Air Force's long-range strike bomber contract.Secretary of the Air Force Deborah Lee James said the bomber award decision was the ""best value for our nation.""Northrop has a long history of developing bombers and was the builder of the B-2.During the company's conference call, CEO Wes Bush said the company will deliver a ""highly capable and affordable bomber"" to the Air Force but declined to talk further about the program due to its classified nature.Teal Group analyst Richard Aboulafia told IBD that Northrop's win is ""a pretty impressive achievement.""""If you look at the differences in size, market power and overall clout of the two competitors, you can't help but be a little but surprised,"" he said of smaller Northrop's win.Boeing's Next Move?But Boeing will likely protest the contract award in the coming weeks.Or Boeing could buy Northrop to stay relevant in the defense airframe space.Boeing still could win the bid for the Air Force's T-38 trainer plane, but it faces stiff competition from four other bidders, and the contract is relatively small at only $12 billion.""It seems like Boeing will have to make a very tough choice,"" Aboulafia said. ""Exit the U.S. combat aircraft business, or they can put in a bid for Northrop.""Aboulafia said the bid could play out over the next three to four years.Last week, Boeing's CEO Dennis Muilenburg said on the company's conference call that the aerospace giant's defense business ""overall is a healthy portfolio"" and that he ""likes the program structures we have.""Boeing shares edged down 0.4% to close at 147.88.The new B-3 bomber will replace Boeing's B-52s, which have been in operation since the 1950s. The Air Force plans to buy 80 to 100 of the new planes, and the contract could be worth $50 billion to $80 billion. The first planes are slated to enter service around 2025.General Dynamics also reported results Wednesday. The defense firm's Q3 EPS climbed 11.2% to $2.28, beating views by 15 cents. Revenue rose 3.1% to $7.99 billion.General Dynamics closed up 1.6% to 150.78.Follow Gillian Rich on Twitter @IBD_sGRich.

450,NOC,"The Defense Department has finalized a $6.1 billion contract with Lockheed Martin (LMT) for the ninth batch of F-35 stealth fighters, according to a Pentagon statement Wednesday.But Lockheed called it a ""unilateral contract action"" that wasn't mutually agreed upon, saying it was ""disappointed"" with the government's decision.The Pentagon previously had insisted the ninth and 10th batches be negotiated together under one $14 billion pact. Lockheed had already gone ahead and started producing the aircraft to stay on schedule, paying out of pocket for months while contracts were negotiated.But the Wall Street Journal reported last month that the Pentagon may award a contract for just lot 9, as talks over pricing dragged on well past expectations.The price tag for the ninth batch, which includes 57 planes, represents a 3.7% weighted average reduction from the eighth low-rate initial production contract signed in December 2014 and a 58% cut since the first such contract, DOD said Wednesday.The $6 billion doesn't include the engines. A separate contract for those was agreed upon with United Technologies (UTX) in April.The first lot 9 fighters will start delivery in Q1 of 2017. So far, 196 F-35s, including test aircraft, have been delivered.Earlier Wednesday, Bloomberg reported that the Pentagon said it will need up to $500 million more to finish the $55 billion development phase of the F-35.The program's simultaneous development and production strategy has come under heavy criticism.

487,NOC,"Boeing (BA) said Wednesday there's a ""realistic possibility"" it will launch a new midsize plane and a longer version of its 737 Max, as the aerospace giant seeks to counter gains from Airbus' (EADSY) A321neo.Management said on a conference call that a new mid-market plane could be delivered in the 2024-2025 timeframe, while a stretched 737 Max could be ready by the end of the decade.Boeing has been mulling a new midsize plane or a longer 737 to fill the gap created by 757 production stopped, but hasn't said before it would do both. The latest comments come as the company has had to lay off employees due in part to Airbus gaining market share, as the A321neo has helped airlines open up new routes.Boeing also said the production rate on the current-generation 777 likely won't go down by more than 1-2 planes a month, adding that it would take ""offsetting actions"" to limit the impact on margins of any further rate cuts.Sales of the 777 have been slowing as customers prefer to wait for the upcoming next-generation 777X, but the company is trying to maintain a certain level of current-generation 777 production to ensure a smooth transition to the 777X on its assembly lines.Boeing shares jumped 4.7% to close at 145.54 on the stock market today, clearing a 139.55 buy point from a flat base and hitting the highest level of the year. Aerospace supplier TransDigm (TDG) rose 1.1% to 271.08, topping a 269.31 entry point.
"
488,NOC,"IBD's TAKE: Foreign commercial sales are key to keeping the 777 line in production, but the aerospace giant is also chasing foreign military sales as looks to score a major fighter jet deal with India. Boeing's core Q3 EPS rose 11.5% to $2.81, excluding a 70-cent per-share tax benefit, above views for $2.60. Revenue fell 8% to $23.9 billion but topped forecasts for $23.64 billion. Revenue from its commercial airplanes division fell 4% to $16.97 billion on lower planned delivery volume. Boeing preannounced a 5.5% decline in commercial deliveries. Defense revenue fell 10% to $7.5 billion on fewer C-17 deliveries and lower F-15 volume.During the quarter, the Air Force signed two contracts with Boeing for a total value of $2.8 billion to make 19 KC-46 tankers. Boeing had taken a charge on the tanker in the last two quarters amid repeated delays and cost overruns.Boeing now plans to deliver 745 to 750 commercial airplanes this year, up from its prior outlook of 740 to 745 planes. It also raised its full-year EPS outlook to $6.80-$7 from an earlier outlook of $6.10-$6.30, but that just adds the 70-cent per-share tax benefit. Analysts see $6.34.Boeing's European rival Airbus reported a 21% drop in quarterly earnings Wednesday, falling short of analyst views due to supplier issues with its A350. Airbus's U.S.-traded shares climbed 3.4% to 15.02.But the company said problems with engines that it uses from United Technologies' (UTX) Pratt & Whitney are ""largely over."" United Tech shares dipped 0.4% to 101.01.""For the remaining months of the year we remain totally focused on deliveries to achieve our earnings and cash guidance,"" CEO Tom Enders said in a release.Airbus said it would deliver over 208 planes by the end of the year, and deliveries of the A350 will nearly double.At its helicopter unit, Airbus saw a slowdown in commercial sales.In a positive day for defense contractors, Northrop Grumman (NOC) broke out of a flat base, gapping above the 224.22 buy point. The company raised its full-year earnings and sales guidance Wednesday after reporting third-quarter results above analyst expectations.Other big gainers in the group included Flir Systems (FLIR), which shot up 10%, and TransDigm Group (TDG), which broke out past the 269.41 buy point of a flat base. Earnings reports were the catalysts for Boeing and Flir Systems.

490,NOC,"Analysts are bullish on top defense stocks Northrop Grumman (NOC), Raython (RTN), L3 Communications (LLL) and Lockheed Martin (LMT) as military spending is expected to ramp up on growing tensions in Syria, Ukraine and the South China Sea.In a note Thursday, Baird analyst Peter Arment wrote that the U.S. defense budget will keep rising and contractor backlogs will get a boost from both domestic and foreign military sales.Weapons spending by the Pentagon was up 16% in fiscal year 2016 and Arment expects spending to rise at least 5% in fiscal years 2017 and 2018 and will ""remain a tailwind for contractor backlogs.""Raytheon was started with an outperform rating and 170 price target by Baird. Arment wrote that the company ""was highly levered to key areas such as missile defense and prevision weaponry."" But Raytheon's sales are more dependent than peers on international sales, and lower oil prices could put pressure on weapons sales from the Middle East.Northrop, which is a major subcontractor on the F-35, was started with an outperform rating and a 260 price target as production on the stealth fighter ramps up and development of the B-21 bomber continues. But like Raytheon, Northrop also faces uncertainty from foreign buyers.Raytheon shares rose 1.12 to 138.25 on the stock market today and is consolidating in a flat base as it tries to retake its 50-day line. Northrop shares rose 1.73 to 214.21, finding resistance at the 50-day line over the last several sessions. It's also forming a base.IBD'S TAKE: Boeing, Lockheed, and others are vying for helicopter, missile and trainer jet deals worth billions of dollars with the Pentagon. Baird included Raytheon and Northrop in its list of top defense picks, along with L3 Communications, which makes intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance systems.Baird rated L3 outperform and gave it a 184 price target, saying much of its sales are tied to a growing budget for classified programs.Lockheed was also initiated with an outperform rating and a 285 price target. But the prime contractor on the F-35 didn't make the top picks list, and Arment warned that pension issues could weigh on the stock.L3 shares, which broke out of a cup base in May, edged up 2.09 to 152.54 Thursday, nearing profit-taking sell territory for those who bought at the May breakout. Lockheed dipped 1.88 to 234.72, hitting a five-month low and threatening to undercut its 200-day moving average for the first time since February.RELATED:Boeing, Lockheed Fighter Sales To Mideast OK'd After Israel Aid DealGermany Buys Lockheed C-130 As Airbus A400 Delays Continue Boeing, Lockheed Fighter Sales To Mideast OK'd After Israel Aid Deal

492,NOC,"NATIONAL HARBOR, Md. -- Lockheed Martin (LMT) and military officials have found a fix for faulty coolant tube insulation and expect it to finish addressing the issue by December.Last week, mechanics discovered that the insulation was eroding in 57 F-35A model planes: 13 already delivered to the Air Force, 2 to the Norwegian military and 42 still in production. No F-35B or F-35C models were affected.At the Air Force Association's Annual Air, Space and Cyber conference Tuesday, Lt. Gen. Christopher Bogdan, F-35 program manager, said engineers cut holes into the wings to remove the faulty insulation. He also said there were access panels on the wings as well that could be used.The technique will be tested early next week. Once validated, the fix will be issued to the 15 planes out in the field over the next week or two. The overall process will be completed in December.""The most recent issue we are dealing with right now is not a technical issue, it is not a design issue but a quality escape from a supplier who supplied us with insulation,"" Bogdan said.Lockheed Martin wouldn't comment on which subcontractor supplied the insulation.IBD'S TAKE: Northrop, Boeing and Lockheed are battling for billions of Pentagon aerospace dollars as the defense aerospace market is booming on increased threats in the Middle East, Russia and South China Sea.Lockheed shares rose 1.4% to 243.82 on the stock market today. Northrop Grumman (NOC), a major subcontractor on the plane, rose 1.8% to 215.85, pennies from retaking its 50-day line.The F-35 has been plagued with problems ranging from the engine, the ejection seat, and the plane's ""brains,"" or the Autonomic Logistics Information System (ALIS) computer.Still the Air Force declared the F-35A ready for combat last month. In July 2015, the F-35B variant was declared combat-ready by the Marines and is set for deployment to Japan in 2017. The Navy's version, the F-35C, is expected to be combat-ready between 2018 and 2019.RELATED: Future Tanker Could Be Stealthy, Laser-Armed To Keep Up With F-35Northrop's B-21 Bomber Named 'Raider' After WWII Doolittle Raid Pilots

507,NOC,"ARLINGTON, Va. — The Defense Department is making a big push to attract companies in Silicon Valley like Apple (AAPL) and Facebook (FB), but venture capital firms are warning fledgling companies to stay away, said an Air Force acquisition official.The number one reason why tech firms are leery of working with the Pentagon is overseas trading restrictions, Camron Gorguinpour, the director of transformational innovation for the Air Force, told IBD.Many tech firms are worried that if they do DOD work, they won't be able to sell their technology overseas or will have to jump though several hoops before getting permission — issues that traditional defense contractors like Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Northrop Grumman (NOC) face.But the Pentagon is looking at ways to relax some restrictions as it hopes to build better relationships with Silicon Valley, Gorguinpour said in an interview at an Air Force Association event.Lockheed shares climbed 1% to close at 204.76 in the stock market today. Northrop shares dipped 0.4% to 166.78. Apple shares rose 0.6% to end the day at 115.00. Facebook shares edged up 0.5% to 94.41.Silicon Valley and the Pentagon have been at odds recently, especially after Edward Snowden's leaks pertaining to government surveillance.Those strains added to the already vast cultural differences between the two sectors — the slow moving, rigid, formal Pentagon and the rapidly developing, informal, creative tech firms.The Pentagon has tried to bridge the divide by opening an office in Silicon Valley as it looks to beef up its cybersecurity and build advanced weapons more quickly.Last month, Defense Secretary Ash Carter announced funding for the Flexible Hybrid Electronic Institute in San Jose, Calif., led by the FlexTech Alliance. It's a consortium of 162 companies, universities and nonprofits that includes Apple, Applied Materials (AMAT), Hewlett-Packard (HPQ), Boeing (BA), Lockheed, and General Motors (GM).He also visited LinkedIn's (LNKD) headquarters to find out how the Pentagon can compete for new employees in tech.

509,NOC,"Details are finally emerging on the size and shape of a secretive new stealth bomber for the Air Force, and the designs are further along than expected, according to reports Wednesday.Northrop Grumman (NOC) is facing off against a Boeing (BA)-Lockheed Martin (LMT) team for the contract, which could be worth $50 billion-$80 billion. Analysts have said the contest is a tossup, as the competing designs for the project have been kept secret.But after a meeting the Air Force held with stakeholders on the project, some clues as to what the bomber will look like have come out. For example, the designs were larger than UCLASS drones being developed for the Navy but smaller than Northrop's B-2 stealth bomber, sources told Defense News.Another source said that the design could have 20% less payload and 20% less range than the B-2, and the winner of the contract could produce a design similar to the UCLASS designs submitted by Boeing and Northrop. Those UCLASS drones resemble the ""flying wing"" design that also appears in the B-2.A separate source told Defense News that a smaller plane doesn't mean a smaller range, adding that the ability to carry different types of munitions was highlighted.Northrop shares closed up 3.3% in the stock market today. Boeing shares finished 2.5% higher, and Lockheed climbed 3.2%.The sources were surprised by how ""mature"" the designs were, far above what is typical for a pre-award program. Both designs have gone through wind tunnel testing and survivability tests, but neither has flown.The Air Force's new bomber will replace aging Boeing B-52s, which have been in operation since the 1950s. The service plans to buy 80-100 of the new planes and is targeting a price tag of about $550 million each.The contact was supposed to be announced in the spring, but the date was pushed back and is expected by the end of this month.The stakes for the contract are high as the bomber will be the only major contract of note for a sophisticated military aircraft in the next 10 years. Analysts have speculated that the loser could be forced to leave the combat airframe business, leading to another round of consolidation in the industry.While the contract is still to close to call, analysts speculate that Boeing could have lost points on its bid due to issues surrounding its problematic aerial refueling tanker program.Follow Gillian Rich on Twitter @IBD_GRich.

Lockheed shares climbed 2.6% to 202.57.In a note last month, Goldman Sachs (GS) said it thinks Northrop is going to get the award, which could be worth $50 billion-$80 billion to the winner over time.But the Defense Department's estimate on the bomber program's cost over the next 10 years has been a moving target. The Pentagon recently put it at $58.4 billion, up 76% from last year's estimate of $33.1 billion, according to Breaking Defense.When Rep. Jackie Speier, D-Calif., questioned officials about the price spike, the Air Force said the actual cost should be $41.7 billion and that earlier figures were due to human error and a lack of oversight. But it said the issue has been resolved.The mix-up comes as Congress is worried about cost overruns in Lockheed's F-35 program, which is well over budget and behind schedule.The Navy recently said it may have to lower its expected orders of the F-35 amid budget pressure. The entire program's buying plan is also under review.Follow Gillian Rich on Twitter: @IBD_sGRich.

522,NOC,"Boeing (BA) is delaying the first flight of its military aerial refueling tanker to October, but analysts don't expect the delays to affect the aerospace giant's bid for the long-range strike bomber.Boeing said late Monday that the first flight for its KC-46 aerial refueling tanker for the Air Force would be delayed by a month after the wrong fuel substitute was put into the plane's system.""This issue will extend the projected first flight date by roughly a month beyond the previous plan to fly (the plane) in late August, early September,"" Boeing spokesman Chick Ramey said in an email to Reuters.A fuel substitute was incorrectly labeled for military use, Ramey said.Boeing shares closed up 0.1% at 144.60 on the stock market today.In July, Boeing said it took a $536 million after-tax charge in the second-quarter over the KC-46 due to higher estimated engineering and manufacturing costs.But the delays and extra charges won't weigh on the Pentagon's decision to award the long-range strike bomber, expected next month, to Boeing or Northrop Grumman (NOC).""These are totally obviously separate programs and while issues with the tanker program are obviously frustrating, the Air Force won't hold that over Boeing,"" said Ken Herbert, a managing director and aerospace and defense analyst at Canaccord Genuity.Herbert doesn't see the delays affecting other areas of Boeing's defense unit but said that the company is putting more resources into the tanker project than originally anticipated and it's squeezing margins.He still thinks Boeing can reach deadlines but will have a very compressed flight test schedule to deliver the first batch of tankers to the Air Force by August 2017.Boeing ""is very hopeful on their ability to win the bomber program,"" Herbert said. ""There are not a lot of new major projects starting right now.""The new bomber will be the only contract of note for a sophisticated military aircraft in the next 10 years, and the loser could be forced out of the military airframe business.Boeing has teamed up with Lockheed Martin (LMT) for the bid. Lockheed Martin stock closed flat at 212.67.Herbert said it's too difficult to say who will win the contract.In a note last month, Goldman Sachs (GS) said that it sees Northrop winning the bid.Follow Gillian Rich on Twitter: @IBD_GRich.

Carlton Everhart, commander of the Air Mobility Command, said the F-35 stealth fighter will move closer to the fight so ""it would make sense that the logistical tail would move with it.""The Air Force is conducting a study to see what a follow-on tanker would look like. But Everhart already has some high-tech ideas that include a radar-absorbing material, a laser for defense, a smaller cockpit, and fuel-efficient hybrid wings.IBD'S TAKE: Northrop, Boeing and Lockheed are battling for billions of Pentagon aerospace dollars as the defense aerospace market is booming on increased threats in the Middle East, Russia and South China Sea.While a competition for a follow-on tanker is still years away, stealth capabilities could be key.

The $9.50 billion XLU ETF holds automobile firms along with retailers, restaurants, apparel chain, luxury goods and more.XLY pulled back in mid-May amid mixed earnings from automakers and others players in retail- and consumer-focused industries. It currently sits 2% below its mid-August high and below the critical 50-day moving average.Some solid numbers from Tesla and its cohorts could help XLY climb back toward that much-watched line, which is a gauge of institutional support for a stock or ETF.XLY earns a relatively low Relative Price Strength (RS) Rating of 37 from IBD. That means it has been outperformed by 63% of stocks over the past 12 months.The consumer discretionary sector is up roughly 3% year to date, lagging every S&P sector except for health care and financials.First Trust NASDAQ Global Auto (CARZ) offers targeted exposure to the car industry. It sits 12% below its 52-week high.The memory-chip maker Micron Technology (MU) will provide a preview of the upcoming earnings season when it reports fiscal Q4 results late Tuesday.Micron stock has been riding an air cushion above the 10-week line for roughly 13 weeks, with few big pullbacks over that period. That's a reflection of the soaring fortunes of the semiconductor industry.IShares PHLX Semiconductor (SOXX) struck a fresh 52-week high Friday. The ETF has delivered a 25% gain to investors year to date. That's a nice turnaround from a 2.0% dip in 2015.It has an RS Rating of 86.Can it keep outperforming most sector equity ETFs? Micron's report, and especially its guidance, may offer a clue about what lies ahead for the high-risk, high-reward semiconductor group.In any case, technology exchange traded funds certainly deserve a spot on your watch list, with the Nasdaq index recently breaking to all-time highs.In addition, an army conference Monday through Wednesday in Washington D.C. is expected to put the focus on defense modernization, cybersecurity and foreign military sales. Boeing (BA), Northrop Grumman (NOC), Airbus (EADSY) and other defense companies are going to be in attendance.The rumblings out of that event may hone or dull investors' interest in a niche tech ETF, PureFunds ISE Cyber Security (HACK), as well as a niche nontech ETF, iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense (ITA).Both ETFs have been decent performers year to date, up roughly 7% and 10% respectively.The September jobs report is out Friday and a host of federal speakers also make speeches Friday, from New York to Washington D.C.Expect rate-sensitive sectors -- everything from dividend funds to fixed income to utilities and financials -- to be on the move as the week rolls on. The Fed put off a rate hike in September, but what the market wants to know is whether a December hike is on the cards.The chart action of Utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU) and SDPR Gold Shares (GLD) tell a similar story.Both fell every single session last week, slicing below their 50-day moving averages. However, GLD's weekly loss came in below-average trading volume, which is a slight positive. The weekly loss for XLU came on average volume.Keep your eyes steady on their charts. If they manage to reclaim the 50-day, it's a bullish sign. If XLU falls below its 200-day, which it seems at some risk of doing, it could spell trouble for one of the best-performing S&P sectors, up 17% year to date.XLU has an RS Rating of 41 and GLD 67.Technology ETFs To Consider As Nasdaq Index Breaks To All-Time HighsMassive Yahoo Hack Raises Questions, Says CEO Of Cybersecurity ETF

Instead, he sees a role for both of them.""We absolutely need the F-35 as soon as we can get it,"" he said. "" We want to pair those two up together.""Shoemaker said the two jets could be flown in tandem to take advantage of the planes' ""very good complement of high-low mix.""Boeing shares rose 0.2% to 135 in the stock market today.

Compare Boeing to others in the Aerospace/Defense group on Stock Checkup.  It's unclear how many more Super Hornets the Pentagon will buy. Without additional orders, Boeing faces the end of its production run. Currently, the Navy has money in its budget for two Super Hornets in 2017 and 14 in 2018.But the service could purchase even more Super Hornets as part of its unfunded spending request, and Congress seems keen to keep the production line open. Boeing has said it needs 24 orders per year to keep the production line alive past 2020.A deal between Boeing and Kuwait for 28 Super Hornets, with an option for 12 more, is facing political roadblocks, so Kuwait recently ordered Eurofighter Typhoons instead.Meanwhile, Shoemaker said that, despite some setbacks with the F-35's development, the Navy has plans to declare the new fighter ready for combat in late 2018. The Navy still needs the new 3F software update on the plane, however.The Air Force declared initial operational capability for its version of the F-35 earlier this month, and the Marine Corps declared its version combat-ready last year.RELATED: Nuclear Missile Cost May Strain Air Force As F-35, B-21 Ramp UpBoeing May Extend F/A-18 Work On Kuwait, Navy OrdersAir Force Touts Combat-Ready F-35 As 'Deterrent To Adversaries'.

554,NOC,"Minus upside surprises from the likes of Facebook (FB), Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL), the earnings picture would look a lot more grim.Tech is among the top sectors beating estimates for both sales and earnings per share in the most recent quarter, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Overall S&P 500 earnings are still in a downtrend, but the pace of decline is less than feared.The market is rewarding stocks like Apple, which is trading above 100 for the first time since late April. But fund investors aren't exactly piling in. Technology ETFs saw net outflow of $617 million in July -- a month that saw real estate exchange traded funds rake in $1.2 billion in fresh money, according to State Street Global Advisors.For Dave Mazza, head of research at State Street's SPDR ETFs, that's a telling sign of investor sentiment.""In an environment where growth is scarce, I would expect to see ETF investors walk into an area that's offering growth, but we're not seeing it,"" Mazza said. This earnings season came on the heels of the Brexit vote and in the middle of presidential conventions that drove investors' attention away from company fundamentals and more toward ""bigger-picture items,"" he noted.And the broad macroeconomic outlook is awash in uncertainties.""Volatility is here to stay as investors fret over the extended age of the current bull market, a lack of earnings growth, China, Europe, and perhaps most importantly, the most divisive U.S. presidential election in recent memory,"" State Street's recent 2016 Mid-Year ETF & Investment Outlook noted. Against that backdrop, the firm has some advice for ETF investors:Smart beta strategies are low-cost and offer broad market exposure, while zeroing in on ""factors"" -- or stock characteristics -- that can give portfolios an extra boost over time, according to State Street.PowerShares S&P 500 High Dividend Low Volatility (SPHD), iShares Edge MSCI Minimum Volatility USA (USMV) and SPDR MSCI Emerging Markets Quality Mix (QEMM) are ETFs that seek out promising factors for the current market scenario.SPHD looks for S&P 500 stocks showing low risk and high yield. It has jumped 20.4% year to date vs. a 7.1 gain for SPDR S&P 500 (SPY), a comparable ETF that gives you the broad U.S. market with no extra frills.Lindsey Bell, a senior analyst with S&P Global, says the industrial sector is -- against the odds -- leading Q2 earnings growth, with consumer discretionary. ""The aerospace and defense industry group dominates the upside surprises for industrials this quarter and even accounted for several guidance raises,"" Bell wrote on Wednesday. Boeing (BA) landed the biggest earnings beat in the group. Northrop Grumman (NOC), Lockheed Martin (LMT) and L-3 Communications (LLL) have bumped up outlook.IBD'S TAKE: To find out which exchange traded funds investing in sectors and industry groups are the current stock market leaders, check out ETF Center.Aerospace is a pocket of strength within industrials, according to Bell. ""We expect that to continue as the remainder of 2016 plays out and believe any improvement, no matter how small, in the economic environment will be a tailwind for the group into the future."" Three ETFs target this niche, including iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense (ITA).Health care is another sector with stronger-than-expected Q2 earnings growth, making it worthy of a spot on ETF watch lists.Chuck Self, CIO of iSectors, whose popular tactical ETF-based strategy invests across nine sectors, is impressed with the latest earnings beats by chipmakers Intel (INTC) and Qualcomm (QCOM). Self told IBD he's ""going back in"" to technology with iShares North American Tech (IGM). Self also likes tech multinationals -- as well as gold miners -- as a weak dollar play.SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) offers an efficient way to hold and trade the precious metal in a brokerage account.

555,NOC,"Lockheed Martin's (LMT) second-quarter revenue is seen rising as F-35 production ramps up, while prospects for foreign sales may get a boost from the stealth fighter's successful demonstration at the Farnborough Airshow.Analysts expect the defense giant's EPS to dip 0.3% to $2.93, but see revenue climbing 8% to $12.56 billion, when it announces Q2 results Tuesday.Lockheed plans to deliver 43 F-35s this year but is expanding operations at its Fort Worth, Texas, plant so it can produce 200 jets per year by the end of 2019. The F-35 and other planes are vital to Lockheed as its aeronautics division, the largest single unit, accounts for roughly 34% of the company's total sales.Earlier this month, Lockheed said it was near an agreement with the Pentagon on a contract covering additional production batches for 160 more F-35s.IBD'S TAKE: Defense stocks have been in buy range recently and showing strength amid recent market volatility.The F-35's fortunes will also factor into other defense contractors' results. United Technologies (UTX) whose Pratt & Whitney division got a $1.5 billion contract in April for 99 more F-35 engines, reports July 26. Northrop Grumman (NOC), another major subcontractor on the F-35, reports July 27.Meanwhile, the F-35's cost is also coming down. Lockheed CEO Marillyn Hewson told CNBC last week that the price is now 57% lower vs. the first aircraft delivered to the Air Force in 2011 and will be fall to $85 million per plane in 2019 from $100 million now. The Pentagon has also said it will extend by two years an F-35 cost-cutting program that so far has trimmed the price tag by $1 million per plane.Reducing the cost could help ease sticker shock on Capitol Hill and increase its appeal overseas. The F-35 finally made its major international debut flying at Farnborough last week, with impressive displays of its short-takeoff, vertical-landing and hovering capabilities seen providing political cover to governments that want to buy the over-budget and behind-schedule fighter.Lockheed has been pushing to expand its foreign sales to account for 25%-30% of total sales in coming years. But the U.S. is on track to approve $40 billion in foreign military sales in fiscal 2016, down from $46.6 billion in fiscal 2015, Navy Vice Adm. Joe Rixey told Reuters at Farnborough.Still, demand from Asia is growing, and orders from the Middle East should help coming in despite an oil prices pressuring government coffers there.Earlier this month, the Pentagon announced that Lockheed's Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system will be stationed in South Korea by late 2017. And Japan is considering Lockheed and Boeing (BA) for a fighter jet order worth up to $40 billion.Saudi Arabia's Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman met with Lockheed and other defense executives last month during his trip to Washington, as the kingdom buys missile-defense systems and bombs amid conflicts in Yemen and Syria.

556,NOC,"Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 could be deployed to Europe and the Pacific without notice as a show of force, according to a top Air Force official.In similar displays, Lockheed F-22s were sent to Lakenheath, England, for a surprise training mission to show adversaries that the U.S. has ""the rapid ability to move airplanes,"" Gen. Herbert Carlisle, head of Air Combat Command, said after a congressional hearing Wednesday, according to Bloomberg.""As soon as I get them operational, I'd like to do that with the F-35s as well, to demonstrate that I can move those airplanes anywhere I need to as rapidly as I can to support combatant commanders' needs -- whether it's in a peacetime training environment, messaging to potential adversaries, or if we ever had to, in the face of conflict,"" he said.Lockheed shares ended virtually flat in the stock market today. Northrop Grumman (NOC), a major subcontractor on the F-35, dipped 0.3%.IBD'S TAKE: Despite Thursday's moves, defense stocks have been in buy range recently and showing strength amid recent market volatility.Meanwhile, the Air Force's version of the F-35 is on track to be declared combat ready this year.There are no technical issues that would delay the F-35A from receiving its initial operational capability status in the current scheduled time frame of August to December, Carlisle said, reiterating prior remarks from the Air Force.There have been some major issues with the plane's development over the years, leaving it behind schedule and over budget.A problem with a United Technologies (UTX) Pratt & Whitney engine forced the fleet to be temporarily grounded in 2014, but the Pentagon said it has since resolved those issues. The plane has also seen problems with its Autonomic Logistics Information System and software issues.The Marine variant of the fighter, the F-35B, was declared combat-ready last July and will be sent to Iwakuni, Japan, in early 2017, but the Marines said the jet is capable of deploying the F-35 to the Middle East for combat, if necessary.The Navy's version, the F-35C, is expected to be combat-ready between 2018 and 2019. It will conduct a third round of shipboard tests aboard the aircraft carrier USS George Washington in August, according to a report from Defense News.""They're going to open up the full envelope of the airplane to land and take off from the carrier, which means things like heavyweight, asymmetric stores, heavy cross winds, high seas,"" Lt. Gen. Christopher Bogdan, F-35 program manager, said. ""Plus we'll do a lot of reliability, maintainability and maintenance administrations to make sure we get that right.""

562,NOC,"A Donald Trump presidency could weigh on ties with key U.S. allies, but Northrop Grumman (NOC) still expects strong international sales regardless of the outcome of the presidential election.At the Citi Industrials conference in Boston on Wednesday, Northrop CFO Ken Bedingfield said there is ""certainly some concern out there in terms of the relationships that have been long-standing partner countries, allied nations"" in response to a question about a how a Trump presidency could affect U.S. foreign relations.He added that ""one particular region probably has more fear of a Trump presidency than others in the globe,"" but one of the strengths of Northrop's portfolio is its diversification among Europe, the Middle East, Africa and the Asia-Pacific region.Northrop didn't respond to requests to clarify which region Bedingfield was referring to.The presumptive GOP presidential nominee has said the U.S. should leave NATO unless other members don't contribute more, and he raised questions about spending money to help defend ""wealthier"" Asian countries like Japan and South Korea.Trump also told the New York Times that he would likely stop buying oil from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates if they didn't send ground troops to fight the Islamic State, arguing that the U.S. isn't getting reimbursed for helping protect the Gulf.But Bedingfield still sees strong sales overseas for U.S. military products, as ""there is a recognition that the world is a dangerous place, and the U.S. and its allies need to inter-operate together."" He also stressed the strong relationships the defense contractor has with partner countries around the globe.The Asia-Pacific region may provide the strongest growth, with demand from South Korea, Japan and Australia, he said. In November, the State Department approved a potential sale of three Northrop Grumman RQ-4 Global Hawk drones to Japan.Vietnam has also been on an arms-buying spree amid tensions over China’s expansion in the South China Sea.And now that the last U.S. embargo from the Vietnam War has been lifted, the country could be interested in the F/A-18 Super Hornet, which is built by Boeing (BA), with Northrop as a major supplier.Other potential winners from lifting the arms embargo include Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Raytheon (RTN).Northrop shares ended trading up 0.2% to 217.24 in the stock market today.

564,NOC,"WASHINGTON, D.C. -- The $1.5 billion in charges Boeing (BA) has taken on its new tanker won't be punishment enough, as the Air Force is in negotiations with the aerospace giant for penalties related to missing key milestones.Air Force Secretary Deborah James said at an International Institute for Strategic Studies talk Monday that there will be ""considerations"" and that negotiations have already started but that it is too early to say what the penalties may be.Earlier, the Air Force said the contract didn't include predefined penalties for missed milestones.""As with any contract schedule breach, the Air Force will seek consideration commensurate with the impact of the breach,""  Air Force spokesman Maj. Robert Leese told Breaking Defense.Boeing shares closed down 0.9% in the stock market today.Last month, Brig. Gen. Duke Richardson, the program executive officer for tankers, said the first 18 Boeing KC-46 tankers will now be delivered to the Air Force in January 2018 and will have some operational limitations, such as being unable to provide fuel via pods on the plane’s wings. That capability will be delivered in October 2018. The tanker was supposed to hit military runways in early 2015.Richardson said the government wouldn’t be on the hook for costs due to the delay. The tanker, which is a modified version of Boeing’s 767 commercial aircraft, is under a fixed-cost contract, so all the cost overruns must be covered by Boeing.The company took a $243 million pretax charge on the tanker program in the first quarter, bringing additional engineering and manufacturing costs to a total of $1.5 billion.Delays over the tanker could have contributed to Northrop Grumman's (NOC) win over a Boeing-Lockheed Martin (LMT) team for the B-21 long strike bomber contract last year. And the KC-46 delay could also affect Boeing's chances in future Pentagon contract competitions.Meanwhile, Boeing's European rival Airbus (EADSY) is having is own troubles over the engine propeller gearbox production of its new A400M military transport plane.Airbus shares fell 2.65%.

566,NOC,"Despite major delays with the new Boeing (BA) tanker for the Air Force, the company's new defense chief expects more commercial jets to be converted for military use.Leanne Caret, president of Boeing's Defense, Space & Security, told the Wall Street Journal that the company wasn't getting out of the fighter jet business all together, but it was instead focusing on maintenance and upgrades for current jets and selling more military versions of its passenger jets.Orders for its F-15s and F/A- 18 jets have slowed, with new jets on the market like the Lockheed Martin (LMT) F-35. But analysts warn that a focus on transport jets and helicopters won't make up for falling fighter jet sales.Boeing is bullish on new contracts like the T-X Air Force trainer, a drone for the Navy and new ballistic missiles. The report said Boeing has sold over 100 of its 737s with surveillance equipment to the U.S., India and Australia. It also is working on the KC-46 tanker, a modified version of Boeing’s 767 commercial aircraft, and expects to sell up to 400.But it hasn't been clear skies for the tanker project. The plane is under a fixed-cost contract, so Boeing is on the hook for all cost overruns. The company reported a $156 million charge in the first quarter on the KC-46, putting the program’s additional engineering and manufacturing costs at nearly $1 billion. Boeing will not be able to deliver the first batch of KC-46 aerial refueling tankers in August 2017 as promised. The tanker was originally supposed to hit military runways in early 2015.Analysts earlier speculated that Boeing’s failure to hit milestones with the tanker was one of the major reasons Northrop Grumman (NOC) was awarded the lucrative B-21 bomber contract last year instead of the Boeing-Lockheed team.The delay could also affect other future military contacts for Boeing.Boeing shares closed down 1.5% in the stock market today. Northrop shares dipped 0.6%. Lockheed shares ended virtually flat.Boeing isn't the only aerospace giant having trouble with military planes. In April, Airbus (EADSY) warned of a “serious challenge” over the engine propeller gearbox production of its new A400M transport plane.Airbus shares lost 2.1%.

The pact is an expansion from a $1.75 billion contract awarded in October 2014.In a note earlier Tuesday, Berenberg analysts said they expect sales of Lockheed's Hellfire missiles and the Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missiles to climb 7% to 8% this year on ""restocking activities in the U.S. and export demand."" Patriot Advanced Capability missile sales are expected to stay in line with 2015 levels.Berenberg said Lockheed has outperformed its peers in the last 12 months except for Northrop Grumman (NOC).

The U.S. also is approving munitions sales to Middle East allies.NATO countries are expected to boost spending this year for the first time in ""many, many years,"" the group's secretary-general, Jens Stoltenberg, told the Financial Times.Last year, NATO's European forces spent $353 billion on defense vs. $618 billion by the U.S., according to the Times.
"
568,NOC,"ARLINGTON, Va. -- Restarting production of Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-22 ""is not a crazy idea,"" Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Mark Welsh said Thursday.The House Armed Services Tactical Air and Land Forces subcommittee earlier this year ordered a study on how much that would cost, and it will be completed soon, he said at an Air Force Association breakfast.""The success of the F-22 and the capability of the airplane ... has proven that the airplane is exactly what everyone hoped it would be,"" Welsh said.Lockheed shares closed up 0.3% in the stock market today.While the Air Force's top uniformed officer appears to be open to the idea of restarting the F-22, officials like the Secretary of the Air Force Deborah Lee James have said that it's cost prohibitive.A 2011 RAND study put the cost of building just 75 more F-22s at $13.7 billion-$17.4 billion in 2008 dollars, depending on a variety of factors. Lockheed did not respond to requests for comment.The F-22 program was canceled in 2009 with only 187 operational planes — less than half of the 381 the Air Force requested — as costs soared. That year, President Obama said expanding the F-22’s budget would be “an inexcusable waste of money,” and Congress took away $1.75 billion in 2009 for additional planes in the 2010 budget.Then-Defense Secretary Robert Gates also said that more F-22s were not wanted or needed by the military, and the final F-22 was built in 2011.Since then, the Pentagon has been touting the over-budget and behind-schedule Lockheed F-35, which is a multirole fighter while the F-22 is an air-superiority fighter.But some analysts and members of Congress, including Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain, are still concerned about the abilities of the F-35 vs. older U.S. jets as well as fighters made by Russia and China.In regards the Air Force's other new plane, Northrop Grumman's (NOC) B-21 bomber, Welsh said that the issue of precisely how many planes will be built is still eight to 10 years away.The Air Force assumes about 100 will be made, but for now, the service is working on getting the program on track, under costs, and on schedule.""This is like having a debate about the number of F-35s 10 to 12 years ago,"" he said.Northrop shares dipped 0.2%.

575,NOC,"Northrop Grumman (NOC) raised its full year earnings outlook Wednesday after reporting first-quarter EPS and sales above Wall Street estimates.Northrop's adjusted earnings, not including a 44-cent per share tax benefit, rose 7.5% to $2.59 per share. Analysts had expected $2.49. Revenue was flat at $5.96 billion but just beat views for $5.93 billion.Aerospace systems sales rose 3% to $2.57 billion on higher F-35 deliveries and higher sales of Global Hawk drones. Mission system sales fell 1% to $2.7 billion and technology services division sales were down 4% to %1.2 billion on lower demand for cyber systems.Northrop shares closed up 1.7% on the stock market today.Northrop raised its full year EPS outlook to  $10.40 to $10.70 from a prior guidance of $9.90 to $10.20. Analysts had expected $10.23.On Tuesday, Lockheed Martin (LMT) raised its full-year guidance after getting a boost in Q1 from F-35 production and its newly acquired Sikorsky unit. Lockheed shares rose 0.3%, after climbing 2.6% Tuesday.General Dynamics (GD) climbed 3.5% after reporting a 9% EPS increase to $2.34, beating views of $2.16, on a 1% revenue dip to $7.72 billion, above views of $7.69 billion.Related:Tanker Woes Hit Boeing's Q1 Profit; Commercial Sales Fall 
"
576,NOC,"Lockheed Martin (LMT) raised its full-year guidance Tuesday as revenue from F-35 production and its newly acquired Sikorsky unit powered first-quarter results.The defense contractor now sees 2016 earnings per share of $11.50-$11.80, up from a prior outlook of $11.45-$11.75 issued in January. But the midpoint is still under analyst estimates for $11.80.Lockheed also boosted its revenue forecast to $49.6 billion-$51.1 billion from a prior outlook of $49.5 billion-$51 billion. Analysts expect $50.3 billion.For Q1, earnings fell 5.8% to $2.58 per share, including a 21-cent per-share reduction due to workforce cuts at its aeronautics and information systems units. Analysts were expecting $2.59 per share.Revenue jumped 15.7% to $11.7 billion above views for $11.34 billion, getting a boost from its Sikorsky acquisition.Sales at Lockheed's aeronautics unit climbed 21% to $3.8 billion on higher net sales for the F-35 and increased deliveries of the C-130 transport aircraft.Sales at the missile and fire control segment rose 4% to $1.4 billion on increased deliveries of its Hellfire missiles. Space systems net sales fell 4% to $2.1 billion.Shares closed up up 2.6% at 232.16 in the stock market today, climbing above a 228.01 buy point from a flat base.The $400 billion F-35 program will come under scrutiny Tuesday as the Senate Armed Services Committee hears from top Pentagon officials.Pentagon acquisition chief Frank Kendall said in prepared testimony that software problems have improved, requiring the F-35's computer to be rebooted less frequently, according to Bloomberg.He and F-35 program manager Lt. Gen. Chris Bogdan also said the development phase is making progress toward completion around Sept. 30, 2017, allowing full-rate production to begin.But the Pentagon's chief weapons tester, Michael Gilmore, warned in his testimony that the development phase would likely extend into 2018 due to the program's delays.Northrop Grumman (NOC), General Dynamics (GD) and Boeing (BA) results are on tap for Wednesday. Raytheon (RTN) reports Thursday.

577,NOC,"Lockheed Martin’s (LMT) first-quarter revenue is seen rising, but international sales could take a hit on lower oil prices, and its new Sikorsky helicopter division may underperform.On Tuesday, the maker of the F-35 and F-16 fighter jets kicks off a busy week for defense contractors, with Northrop Grumman (NOC), General Dynamics (GD) and Raytheon (RTN) also on tap. Boeing (BA), which has substantial defense operations, reports Wednesday.Analysts see Lockheed reporting a 5.5% drop in EPS to $2.59, following a 5% drop in Q4. Revenue is seen rising 12.4% to $11.36 billion, helped by recent acquisitions.All eyes will be on the Sikorsky unit that Lockheed bought from United Technologies (UTX) last year. In a February SEC filing, Lockheed said that the business ""may underperform relative to our expectations” and that demand for helicopters and other products from the unit could be “adversely affected by global economic conditions, including oil and gas trends that are outside of its control.”At Lockheed's annual media day in March, CEO Marillyn Hewson said that the company is taking a more cautious tone on international sales to the Middle East and others dependent on oil prices. In the Q4 earnings conference call, Hewson said that plunging oil prices haven’t affected weapon sales to the Middle East and that countries heavily dependent on oil exports are cutting back in other areas.Lockheed may also give an update on the progress of getting a deal with the Pentagon on lots nine and ten for the F-35.On Friday, a Lockheed spokesperson told the Washington Post that the company would lay off ""less than 200"" workers in its IT division. The cuts come after the company said in November that it would lay off 500 employees as it divests the unit as part of its deal with Leidos (LDOS) to focus on its aircraft and weapons units.Lockheed shares rose fractionally on the stock market Friday, up 0.3% to 226.81. The stock has been moving sideways for the past two weeks, less than 1% below a 228.01 buy point in a consolidation going back to late November.Northrop Grumman results are on tap for Wednesday. The Global Hawk maker’s EPS is seen climbing 3.3% to $2.49, but revenue is expected to dip 0.5% to $5.93 billion. Congress is pushing the Pentagon to buy even more of Northrop’s B-21 bombers. Northrop Grumman shares broke to a new high in weak volume late last month but remain in buy range.General Dynamics will also announce results Wednesday. Analysts see EPS edged up 0.9% to $1.26 and revenue down 1.2% to $7.69 billion. General Dynamics stock rose fractionally Friday but has been trading below its 200-day line since early December.Raytheon rounds out the week on Thursday.  Analysts expect the maker of the Tomahawk cruise missile to report a 23% drop in EPS to $1.38 but revenue is seen climbing 3.2% to $5.46 billion. Shares are trading about 3% below their Dec. 17 peak of 129.99.

580,NOC,"Advances in artificial intelligence and robotics potentially leading to a robot apocalypse have been a popular theme in Hollywood this year. Already we've seen ""Avengers: Age of Ultron,"" ""Chappie"" and ""Ex Machina"" entertain audiences with the idea of a machine uprising.Next up is ""Terminator Genisys"" starring Arnold Schwarzenegger and Emilia Clarke. The latest in the ""Terminator"" robot apocalypse movie series opens in U.S. theaters on Wednesday.Beyond the entertainment industry, British theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking and tech industry icons Bill Gates and Elon Musk have expressed worries about the dangers of AI.If the robot apocalypse is coming, the seeds of our destruction likely have already been planted. What follows is a look — mostly tongue-in-cheek — at the publicly traded companies that could play a part in the robot destruction of the human race.All of these companies are working on technologies that will benefit mankind, including smarter computers, self-driving cars and disaster response robots. But what if our robot friends suddenly decided they didn't want to serve us anymore?IBM (IBM) has been linked to the robopocalypse in the minds of the general public since ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" The classic 1968 science-fiction film featured a murderous AI computer called HAL 9000. Many people have conjectured that the name HAL was based on a one-letter shift from the name IBM.Fast-forward to today, and IBM is a leader in artificial intelligence with its Watson computer system.After defeating puny humans on the TV game show ""Jeopardy"" in 2011, Watson has tackled bigger problems in fields such as health care and oil and gas production.In January 2014, IBM created a new business unit around Watson. Around that time, IBM CEO Virginia Rometty said she wanted Watson to generate $10 billion in annual revenue within 10 years.Internet search leader Google (GOOGL) has taken a keen interest in robotics, acquiring a number of companies in the emerging field. But it's been secretive about its plans.This month, Google-owned Boston Dynamics supplied Atlas humanoid robots to six competitors in the DARPA Robotics Challenge. One took the second-place prize of $1 million after completing a simulated disaster response scenario. Looking like Terminator's bulkier cousin, the Atlas robot stands 6 feet 2 inches and weighs 345 pounds.For the DARPA contest, the Atlas robot drove a car, exited it and walked through a course performing such tasks as opening a door, turning a valve, cutting a hole in the wall and climbing a set of stairs. Those tasks will come in handy for responding to disasters like saving a crippled nuclear power plant. They also would be useful for chasing down and killing humans.Boston Dynamics is known for its scary, fast-moving, quadrupedal robots like BigDog and Cheetah, developed for the U.S. military.In addition, Google is working on self-driving cars. For the robot apocalypse to happen, bots will have to move fast and travel great distances to exterminate mankind.E-commerce giant Amazon (AMZN) has deployed an army of 15,000 robots in its warehouses to retrieve shelves full of products and bring them to fulfillment workers. It also is exploring the use of robotic arms that can pick and pack items.Plus, Amazon is experimenting with aerial drones that it hopes can one day deliver packages within minutes to your doorstep. The Amazon Prime Air drone project was announced in late 2013 and has been slowed by government regulatory hurdles.Don't go thinking drones are harmless flying machines. Ask singer Enrique Iglesias. In May, a quadcopter filming his concert in Tijuana, Mexico, slashed some of his fingers. He had to undergo reconstructive hand surgery.In December, a mistletoe drone at a TGI Friday's restaurant cut someone's nose and chin.Now drones have a taste for blood.Bedford, Mass.-based iRobot (IRBT) is best known for home robots like the Roomba vacuum cleaner. It also makes virtual-presence robots that let people tour facilities and meet face to face with others over great distances.It also makes rovers for defense and law enforcement customers. These robots conduct reconnaissance, check out unsafe buildings, and assist in bomb detection and disposal. About 5,000 such robots from iRobot are in the field. They are performing dangerous missions and keeping human soldiers and police out of harm's way.IRobot's biggest military bot is the 710 Kobra. It weighs 500 pounds and can reach as high as 11.5 feet. With its tanklike tracks, it can reach speeds of up to 8 miles per hour, can easily climb stairs and fit through doorways and aisles.It's not hard to imagine that someday robots will be armed to take out enemy combatants via remote control. One step away from robot domination.Apple (AAPL) introduced its intelligent personal assistant Siri in October 2011. The female-voiced computer program can answer spoken questions, make recommendations and perform tasks like setting your alarm clock.Apple has continued to improve the usefulness and accuracy of Siri. The program started as an app on the iPhone and has migrated to Apple Watch and soon the Mac computer.Competing programs have cropped up, such as Cortana from Microsoft (MSFT) and Google Now.Siri has a personality and is known for talking sass to users when irritated. Given advancements in AI, I wouldn't want to get her too upset.When the history of the robot apocalypse is written, after John Connor or whoever defeats our robot overlords, historians may look to blame drone manufacturers.Unmanned aerial vehicles like the Predator combat drones built by General Atomics, a privately held defense contractor in San Diego, have been critical to the U.S. war on terrorist groups in the Middle East. Other U.S. drone makers include Boeing (BA) and Northrop Grumman (NOC).These lethal drones are under human control from remote terminals. But if they become sentient, look out.If robots are ever going to be able to effectively hunt down humans, they're going to need good machine vision.Perhaps they'll use technology developed by Mobileye (MBLY). Its technology is being used for car safety systems, with an eye toward autonomous cars. Mobileye's camera-based advanced driver assistance systems are being used today by top automakers such as Audi, BMW, Chrysler (FCAU), General Motors (GM), Ford Motor (F), Honda (HMC) and Volvo.And if killer robots are going to see in the dark, they might use thermal imaging systems developed by Flir Systems (FLIR).If robots are going to take over the world, they'll need to mass-produce soldier robots.Who better to produce killer robots than industrial manufacturing robots?Leaders in industrial robots today include ABB (ABB), Fanuc, Kuka and Yaskawa Motoman.In May, ABB opened a robot-building operation in Auburn Hills, Mich., to be close to the Big Three U.S. automakers: GM, Ford and Chrysler.

615,NOC,"Simon ""Si"" Ramo was the oldest person awarded a patent. He was 100. Now, two years later, he thinks that might have been his last. But you never know with the Energizer Bunny of the centurion set: He led the team that invented the electron microscope for General Electric (GE), earning 25 patents there before he was 30. At Hughes Aircraft, he developed the first guided air-to-air missile for the new U.S. Air Force in the early 1950s. He started TRW Inc. to create the intercontinental ballistic missile system to protect America from nuclear attack by the Soviets. In 1964 he formed Bunker-Ramo, which pioneered computer electronics, including the Nasdaq quotation system. At 95 he became an engineering professor at the University of Southern California and three years later added three more books to his already published 15.""He's a multidimensional leader and a true Renaissance man,"" Bruce Gerding, who has worked with Ramo on projects over four decades, told IBD. ""He's an accomplished violinist, wrote a best-selling book on tennis and a guide to using humor as a management tool, 'To Wit.' ""California Kid At 102Ramo still lives in L.A., where he hangs out with younger Hollywood, like 98-year-old Kirk Douglas, but decided nearly a century of interviews was enough and declined to comment for this story.Ramo was born in Salt Lake City in 1913 to Lithuanian Jewish immigrants who owned a clothing store where he spent his teens working.The whiz kid got into the University of Utah at 16 by investing his $325 savings in a better violin.He played it to win a music contest and gain the prize — a scholarship to study anything he wanted.Four years later, he had a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering. At 23, he graduated magna cum laude with dual Ph.D.s in electrical engineering and physics from the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena.In 1936 Depression America, jobs weren't plentiful, but he was hired by GE for two reasons: his impressive academic record and because the recruiter realized Ramo's violin skills could help the company's commitment to the community symphony in Schenectady, N.Y.Ramo soon became its concertmaster while leading the research lab over the next decade.Much of the work focused on high-powered microwave frequencies for radar. He also wrote his first two books while at GE, the second of which, ""Introduction to Microwaves"" in 1945, sold 1 million copies in eight languages and continues to be used.In 1937, Ramo had married Virginia Smith and they had two sons, James and Alan. She died in 2009.Ramo enjoyed living in the Los Angeles area, and in 1946 he accepted an offer to direct electronics research at Hughes Aircraft Co. as unspent war funds poured in.He formed an effective team with Dean Wooldridge, a Caltech classmate who managed the business side of projects, such as integrated radar and fire-control systems.But in ""The Business of Science,"" published in 1988, Ramo described their frustration trying to communicate with the eccentric billionaire owner, Howard Hughes.""It was in 1950, as we were engaged in the challenging task of doubling our size, when his problems with commercial airline operations at TWA and moviemaking at RKO began to make front-page news,"" Ramo wrote. ""Department of Defense leaders expressed alarm that so large a fraction of their most urgent military-technology projects were in a company owned by Hughes. They could deliberately set out to rein in Hughes Aircraft by placing new contracts elsewhere ... yet they knew such action would destroy it and its best people would leave, and failure to perform would result.""They repeatedly hinted that it would be well if a few of the key people were to establish another company to create the competition that was needed — provided the departures did not get out of hand.""After several meetings with Hughes that confirmed their concerns, Ramo and his partner founded Ramo-Wooldridge in 1953 with the financial backing of Thompson Products, an auto parts supplier.The Pentagon quickly tapped the new firm to head development of the first intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), playing catch-up to the Soviets.The mission impossible: Invent a missile 10 times more powerful than existing ones. Make sure its material could withstand re-entry into the atmosphere. Include a guidance system that would land it precisely on a target on the other side of the world.Ramo and his teammate ran into plenty of glitches. Such as: After watching several test rockets blow up on their launch pads at Cape Canaveral, Fla., one rose six inches before exploding.Ramo turned to the general observing the tests and quipped, ""Well, Benny, now we know the thing can fly. All we have to do is improve its range a bit.""That they did. Coordinating a maze of subcontractors, Ramo beat the Russians in producing the first ICBM in 1958, without serious cost overruns.Aiming HighAlso in 1958, Ramo merged his firm with Thompson Products to form TRW Inc., and he headed development of the Thor, Atlas and Titan rockets over the next decade.The Atlas was the launch vehicle for NASA's Mercury spacecraft that enabled John Glenn to become the first American to orbit the earth in 1962.TRW also built the space probe to Jupiter, made engines for the Apollo moon landings and invented rocket-destroying lasers.Ramo steered his team into other areas, including auto electronics and computerizing customers' bill-paying history for retailers, banks and credit card companies.In 2002 he sold his military business to Northrop Grumman (NOC).The car supply business became TRW Automotive (TRW), headquartered in Livonia, Mich., which enjoyed a 7,500% stock ride from 2009 to last summer.This month the Federal Trade Commission approved the purchase of TRW Automotive by Germany's ZF Friedrichshafen after TRW finishes its sale of its suspension business to THK Co.Back in 1964, TRW and aerospace giant Martin Marietta (now part of Lockheed Martin (LMT) formed jointly owned Bunker-Ramo Corp., with Ramo as president. It manufactured electronics for the military and developed early digital computers.In 1981, Bunker-Ramo was bought by what became Allied Signal, which merged with Honeywell (HON) in 1999.Presidential HubRamo went on to found other companies and sell them. He has also given advice to the White House, Pentagon and NASA.President Gerald Ford named him co-chairman of a group that prioritized science and technology goals. President Jimmy Carter awarded him the National Medal of Science. President Ronald Reagan gave him the Medal of Freedom and had him coach Taiwan on developing high-tech industries.""Dr. Ramo commands respect across government, business and academia,"" said Gerding. ""His greatest strength is as a communicator, with a way of taking complex scientific issues and explaining them so they can be understood by his audience, whether they are industry leaders, students, politicians or the general public. He's also fantastic at telling stories to illustrate his points.""So what has he learned about business management in his long career? He has filled several volumes with advice, such as these tips from ""Meetings, Meetings and More Meetings: Getting Things Done When People Are Involved"": While video transmission may replace some in-person gatherings, teleconferences and email don't let you assess facial expression and body language. Consider why you were invited to a meeting and develop a secret agenda, as well as anticipating those of others. If you chair a meeting, press participants to reach clarity about the differences in their viewpoints, then find common ground. Combine ethics with good manners when criticizing others. Managers should lighten up the discussion if a meeting gets tense.When he was 12, Ramo abandoned his hope of playing violin professionally after seeing the great Jascha Heifetz perform far beyond anything he thought he could attain.Before Heifetz's death in 1987, Ramo went on stage and played a duet with him, showing that with persistence and hard work, any dream can be achieved.

627,NOC,"The long-range bomber contract may not force Boeing (BA) to buy Northrop Grumman (NOC), despite widespread expectations that it will trigger industry consolidation, according to a report from Citigroup analysts released Tuesday.Boeing, which has teamed up with Lockheed Martin (LMT), and Northrop are competing for a contract estimated to be worth $70 billion to $90 billion. A decision is expected this summer.The new bomber will be the only contract of note for a sophisticated military aircraft in the next 10 years, and analysts speculate that the loser could be forced out of the defense airframe business.Under some scenarios, if Boeing loses, it might buy Northrop to hold onto a piece of the military airframe market. If Northrop loses the bid, it would be an easy takeover target as it lacks any big programs.But not so fast, says Citi analyst Jason Gursky in a note.A Northrop buyout ""runs counter to BA's telegraphed cash deployment priorities for the next few years,"" he wrote, adding that Boeing instead has its eyes on other assets like United Technologies' (UTX) Sikorsky helicopter unit.Boeing has been vocal about its plans to return its free cash to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks.Gursky also said the Pentagon is against consolidation in the industry so that it can maintain competition among contractors.While no one yet knows the outcome of the classified program, Citi said Lockheed's involvement with Boeing on the project could be in Northrop's favor, because the Department of Defense might not give Lockheed, which is already making the F-35, a piece of another major project.But preventing consolidation isn't a top focus for the Pentagon.If macro issues like consolidation weren't laid out in the original contract terms, they won't be part of the award consideration, Teal Group analyst Richard Aboulafia said in an earlier interview with IBD.Northrop's CEO also said consolidation would be unlikely.""I would be careful about making prognostications that the (bomber decision) alone has a reshaping impact on the industry,"" Wes Bush said in the company's Q1 conference call last week.Boeing and Northrop shares were flat in the stock market today.Related: Boeing Boeing Gone?

659,NOC,"When Litton Industries President Roy Ash took his family on a long European vacation in the 1960s, he came up with a novel itinerary.The father of five told each child to pick a country of interest, learn all about it, study the language, make all the hotel and travel arrangements, and share its history and lore with the rest of the family.It was an inventive approach, but to Ash, inventiveness was second nature.In 1953 he and his friend Charles ""Tex"" Thornton borrowed $1.5 million to buy a firm they named Litton Industries after its founder, engineer Charles Litton.In the next 15 years, they pioneered the concept of the modern conglomerate, building the tiny electronics firm into a highly diversified and glamorous multinational company with $2.5 billion in sales.As the Beverly Hills-based company's financial and technical wizard, Ash (1918-2011) guided Litton into products ranging from frozen foods to ships, microwave ovens to aircraft guidance systems, typewriters to medical equipment.""It was revolutionary,"" Bob Flaherty, who covered the heyday of conglomerates for Forbes magazine, told IBD. ""The idea of unrelated diversification was considered something that didn't make sense. The thinking was that no one could run something that diversified. But these guys did. They made it boom.""Ash's meteoric business management career impressed President-elect Richard Nixon, who asked him to address the business of managing big government in 1968.The Ash Council's proposals led to the creation of some of Washington's most prominent agencies, including the Office of Management and Budget and the Environmental Protection Agency. In 1972, Ash resigned as president of Litton to become director of an agency that he helped create — the OMB.'Surrogate President'A down-to-earth man who drove a station wagon to his White House job, Ash filled a power vacuum during Nixon's Watergate crisis. ""(Ash became) a surrogate president, administering the Nixon White House policies,"" The New York Times wrote in 1974.Ash had come a long way from his modest roots. The son of a hay and grain dealer, he was born in Los Angeles and grew up during the Great Depression. An early flair for numbers helped him graduate from high school, where he was the youngest and shortest member of his class, at age 16.""Partly because my youth and height made me acutely shy, partly because my parents didn't insist on college, I passed up further studies and began looking for work,"" he recalled in a 1977 Los Angeles Times interview.After working briefly for his father, Ash took a clerical job for Bank of America (BAC). The entry-level position paid $65 a month.Then the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor in December 1941, and Ash joined the Army.In a break that shaped his life, Ash was assigned to the Army Air Forces' statistical control service, a Harvard-based group that included Thornton and future Defense Secretary Robert McNamara.By applying numbers-oriented management theory to warfare, the group made sure that there were enough planes where needed, with enough pilots and enough working parts to keep them airborne.""They were really smart people who had to make important decisions very quickly,"" Flaherty said. ""People were getting killed.""In 1946, a year after World War II ended, McNamara, Thornton and eight other Army Air Forces statisticians offered their services as a group to Ford Motor (F).The firm said yes, and the team became known as the Whiz Kids.Ash didn't join them. He was busy at Harvard's graduate business school, which had invited him to take its two-year course.His answer to the university had been: ""I can't. I don't have an undergraduate degree.'""Harvard: ""You let us worry about that.""So starting in 1946, Ash completed the two-year course in a year and a half. He graduated first in his class in 1947 and rejoined Bank of America for two years.Two years later, Ash joined Hughes Aircraft, where Thornton had become operating chief.""Thornton took all the bright guys in the Air Force to Ford, and when he went to Hughes, scraped around the bottom of the barrel and found me,"" Ash recalled years later with self-deprecatory humor.As chief financial officer, Ash helped to reorganize the company and bring its sales from $1.5 million to $200 million in five years.Ash and Thornton quit in 1953 to buy Litton, leaping into the hottest activity in business: building conglomerates.Cracking The CodeIn the era of the conglomerate, Wall Street was enchanted by the Ash-Thornton idea of applying modern technology and management to form a multi-industry company that would be recession-proof. When one segment of the economy misfired, other Litton enterprises picked up the slack.With a booming stock market, the company could buy up other corporations without having readily available cash, using instead their high-flying stocks.""They were way ahead of the curve,"" Flaherty said. ""They set the patent. They had the business background. And they had the military background, where they had proven performance in huge, huge operations. That's a tremendously valuable thing, whether you're going into Ford or starting a new company. After the war, there was a tremendous spurt of growth, and you had a shortage of people who could do things. That was great for young (business leaders).""In its first decade, Litton's sales increased 18,750% to $750 million a year, and earnings soared 10,175%, reported Time magazine in 1963.Litton never had a quarter in the red. In one of the greatest acquisition sprees up to that time, Litton swallowed up 40 other corporations and established 71 plants in America and other countries.During that decade, 22 Litton executives became millionaires.In 1959, the firm reached $120 million in sales. By 1961, Litton was the fastest-growing company on the New York Stock Exchange, according to the Harvard Business School.""An entrepreneur tends to bite off a little more than he can chew, hoping he'll quickly learn how to chew it,"" Ash once quipped.In 1961, Ash moved from executive vice president to president, replacing Thornton, who remained CEO and chairman, as well as the star of the red-hot conglomerate.$1 Billion And CountingUnder Ash's leadership, Litton continued its high rate of growth, even after it passed the $1 billion mark in sales. The company had become one of the nation's largest defense contractors by 1968, the year Ash became an adviser to Nixon on ways to improve efficiency in the federal government.The Ash Council's 427-page report proposed what Nixon called the most extensive reorganization of the executive branch since 1789.It called for creating new agencies, plus merging several domestic departments into four super-Cabinet spots: Natural Resources, Economic Affairs, Human Resources and Community Development.Congress rejected the super-Cabinet proposal, but Ash's suggestion for new agencies survived.""(We) contributed two or three innovations. If they have a lasting effect, I'll consider myself enormously successful,"" he said in the late 1970s. ""One was to create the Office of Management and Budget out of an agency that had been traditionally the Bureau of the Budget. The object was not to build an empire. I'm one who believes the least government is the best government. My goal was to impose managerial responsibility on the spending of more than $300 billion a year.""Ash continued as OMB director under President Gerald Ford for seven months, leaving in 1975.A year later, Ash was named chairman and CEO of AM International, a Cleveland-based manufacturer of duplicating machines.After he resigned from that company in 1981, he and Lila, who would stay married to him for 68 years, divided their time between Los Angeles and Virginia, where they bought three farms.Litton Industries, meanwhile, saw its winning streak come to an end in 1969, when its earnings and stock plummeted.By the 1980s, the company was riding high again as a high-tech power. Northrop Grumman (NOC) bought Litton for $5.1 billion in 2001, nearly a half-century after Ash, Thornton, McNamara and other Whiz Kids ushered in a new era in American business.""They were great leaders,"" said Flaherty. ""They were company builders.""

671,NOC,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — The Marine Corps Commandant said Thursday he is ""very confident"" that Lockheed Martin 's (LMT) F-35 will be ready for combat this year, despite ""complex"" issues with the plane.The F-35 is expected to be combat-ready for the Marine Corps in July, but there are 54 separate modifications needed to be done on the aircraft before then, said Gen. Joseph Dunford at the House Appropriations Committee's defense subcommittee hearing.Lockheed shares fell 1% to 201.09 on the stock market today.Dunford said the issues with the plane are complex but he is ""absolutely optimistic"" that everything will be ready.""The work is spread out, so we can get it done in time,"" he said to reporters after the hearing. ""I've taken a look at the folks that we have doing it, and we have the capacity and they have the time and they've got the parts.""A software patch for the Autonomic Logistics Information System, which helps manage diagnostics, maintenance and supply-chain issues, also will be ""satisfactory"" and will have the plane working at its ""highest capacity.""Last year, the Government Accountability Office found that the F-35 program continues to ""encounter slower than expected progress in developing the Autonomic Logistics Information System.""The stealth jet is behind schedule and over budget, but Dunford stressed the need for the plane because other jets in service are near the end of their life-cycles.Software glitches have been a persistent problem, and earlier reports said software issues will prevent the F-35 from being able to fire its 25mm cannon until 2019.Also during the hearing, Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Jonathan Greenert said submarine shipbuilding is a top priority as Congress asks the Navy to scale back its budget.General Dynamics (GD) and Huntington Ingalls Industries (HII), which was spun off from Northrop Grumman (NOC) in 2011, are the two major submarine defense builders.GD shares dipped 0.5%, and Huntington was up 1%.Follow Gillian Rich on Twitter: @IBD_GRich.

672,NOC,"As the multibillion-dollar market for military and commercial drones gains traction, Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Raytheon (RTN) are just two firms that could benefit from the State Department's newly announced policy on expanding drone exports to allies.On Tuesday, the Obama administration established new standards for the global export of the unmanned devices that include strict sale conditions and ""end-use assurances"" from recipient nations.The new policy, which prohibits the use of American drones for ""unlawful surveillance,"" opens the door to U.S. drone and arms manufacturers looking to make sales abroad.According to Reuters, the U.S. has sold armed drones to the U.K., while unarmed U.S. military drones have been sold to countries like France and Italy. The State Department will now review requests for armed drones from Italy and Turkey.Lockheed could notably stand to gain from increased drone exports: the General Atomics' Predator and Reaper drones use Lockheed missiles.The State Department's decision could also boost makers of drone components.""Additional sales of Reapers to international users would benefit Raytheon, maker of the MTS-B multispectral targeting sensor, and L-3 Communications (LLL), which provides satellite communications components and training simulators,"" said Guggenheim Partners' Roman Schweizer in a note. ""Honeywell (HON) supplies turboprop engines and guidance components.""Lockheed shares were down 0.2% on the stock market today. L-3 dipped 0.4%, Honeywell rose 0.5%, and Raytheon eased 0.6%.Northrup Grumman (NOC), which makes the Global Hawk drone, and General Atomics, a privately held spinoff of General Dynamics (GD), were part of a growing chorus that reportedly had been pushing the U.S. government for more lenient export rules prior to Tuesday's announcement.Meanwhile, the FAA's proposed regulations for flying commercial drones in U.S. airspace have come under fire.Under draft rules, drones would not able to fly over people and must weigh less than 55 pounds, among other restrictions, preventing retailers like Amazon (AMZN) from making commercial drone deliveries. Companies currently authorized by the FAA to fly drones in the country include Trimble Navigation (TRMB) and AeroVironment (AVAV).

676,NOC,"Lockheed Martin (LMT) is expected to see orders for its F-35 stealth fighter rise in the proposed fiscal 2016 Pentagon budget, which also requests money to develop a follow-on fighter jet.The official budget request won't be released until Monday, but Politico reported the Defense Department will ask for $585 billion, $35 million above the limit set by sequestration, requiring Congress to lift its spending limits.The budget would include a $10.6 billion request for 57 F-35 fighter jets, up from the 38 F-35s approved for fiscal 2015.Lockheed shares rose 1.5% to 193.33 in the stock market today. On Tuesday, the defense giant report Q4 earnings that missed views, though the F-35 program helped revenue top estimates.The F-35 hasn't entered combat service — that is supposed to happen later this year — but defense officials are reportedly starting to plan for new planes.Pentagon acquisition chief Frank Kendall says the 2016 request will include funds to begin development of separate jets for the Air Force and Navy with a more high-tech engine, according to the Wall Street Journal.Lockheed along with Boeing (BA) and Northrop Grumman (NOC) are the likely contenders for the airframe contract, with General Electric (GE) and United Tech's (UTX) Pratt & Whitney seen vying for the engine work. Pratt & Whitney currently makes the engines for the F-35.Development of a next-generation fighter jet would come amid cost overruns, schedule delays and technical glitches for the F-35. Meanwhile, China allegedly has used stolen F-35 plans to help create its own stealth fighter, the J-31.The Defense Department will also seek $1.2 billion for the development of a new long-range bomber — another contract that's expected to be hotly contested — as well as $821 million procurement of MQ-9 Reaper drones, according to Politico.Follow Gillian Rich on Twitter: @IBD_GRich.

677,NOC,"Lockheed Martin (LMT) has worked out some mechanical issues on the F-35 and racked up more orders, but there are still problems with the stealth jet that could weigh on quarterly earnings.The defense giant reports Tuesday, kicking off a busy week for aerospace companies and Pentagon contractors. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect a nearly 40% jump in Lockheed's fourth-quarter EPS to $2.85 per share. Sales are seen rising 3% to $11.9 billion.During the last quarter, the $400 billion F-35 program got a boost when the Pentagon ordered an eighth batch of fighter jets for $4 billion. The contract also includes additional cost savings. In October, the U.K. announced an agreement in principle to order four more F-35s, bringing the total order up to 14. Israel also has plans to buy more F-35s.United Technologies' (UTX) Pratt & Whitney division said it would supply a seventh batch of F125 engines for the F-35, also with some cost savings.And more orders could come as production costs fall. Operational costs should also fall 15%, Rear Adm. Randy Mahr, the Pentagon's F-35 deputy program manager, told Reuters last year.But developmental problems persist. After an engine fire that temporarily grounded the F-35 fleet last summer, other issues continue to plague the program.Due to delays in software development, the F-35B model won't be able to fire its 25mm cannon by the Marine Corps' July target to declare the jet ready for combat use.Software issues don't stop with the gun. Michael Gilmore, the Pentagon's director of combat testing, told Congress recently there were ""serious deficiencies with hardware and software used to develop data files"" in the plane's computers. The files help identify enemy radar and ""are essential.""But the plane remains in demand around the world. And while the Pentagon and militaries abroad have scaled back budgets, the rise of the Islamic State, unrest in Syria and an aggressive Russia could mean more spending on high-tech weaponry like the F-35.General Dynamics (GD) is slated to announce Q4 results Wednesday. The defense contractor is seen posting a 21% rise in EPS to $2.13 but revenue is seen declining 0.8% to $8.04 billion.Northrup Grumman (NOC) is scheduled to announce results Thursday. The maker of the B-2 Spirit strategic bomber and the Global Hawk drone is expected to report a 6.1% increase in EPS to $2.25 but a 2.7% drop in revenue to $5.99 billion.Last week Northrop CEO Wes Bush said that he was happy with the government's approval of some drone exports but is still concerned that U.S. companies are losing market share over the ban on exporting large drones.Raytheon (RTN) is also slated to announce results Thursday. Analysts expect it to report a 23.3% jump in earnings per share and sales are seen rising 3.4% to $6.07 billion.The Aerospace/Defense group is ranked No. 59 out of the 197 industry groups IBD tracks, up from 104 eight weeks ago.Follow Gillian Rich on Twitter: @IBD_GRich.

714,NOC,"Looking back on his 150 bombing missions over North Vietnam, Ronald Zlatoper recalls something even more nerve-wracking than missiles flying by him.Namely, setting the jet down.""Even more stressful than nearly being killed by the enemy was having to land back on the carrier at night,"" Zlatoper, 71, told IBD. ""I had nighttime landings 300 out of 1,000 times, so it's a blessing I'm alive.""Not that daytime landing was a picnic.According to Frank Harvey's ""Air War: Vietnam,"" the 4.5-acre flight deck of an aircraft carrier is ""the scene of concentrated sound and fury unmatched on any airfield in the world.""Zap, as he goes by, survived all that to become an aviation admiral while earning top honors: the Distinguished Service Medal and Distinguished Service Cross.Zlatoper was born in Cleveland. His father set an example of hard work, starting in the coal mines and ending up as a corporate vice president.Zlatoper gained a Reserve Officers' Training Corps scholarship and checked a list of 52 colleges.His choice: Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y., because it was the most expensive. He figured that made it the best.Officer In The AirAfter graduating, he sped to flight training in 1963 as a fresh ensign.The next year, the Navy chose him to pilot the A-6 Intruder.The all-weather jet was the most sophisticated aircraft used in the Vietnam War, with 13% of its empty weight taken up by electronics, according to Harvey.""I didn't even know what it was, and when I saw it I thought it was the ugliest thing I'd ever seen,"" said Zlatoper. ""The squadron was sure there was some mistake having a novice pilot assigned and told me to go home until they confirmed it.""As it turned out, it was the plane he flew the most.His first combat tour of Vietnam came off the carrier Constellation as a lieutenant junior grade in 1966. He quickly felt a deathly pressure in the air, surrounded by red, green and blue anti-aircraft tracers.Zlatoper and his fellow A-6 airmen were trained to drop its bombs all at once.If the pilots made another pass for more accuracy, enemy gunners would have set their sights for a direct hit.Still, on his fifth mission, his flight leader decided they had to take out a critical bridge.They somehow did it with 12 attacks.Zlatoper got used to the rush, but the danger was real: 881 Navy aviation crew members were killed or captured during the war.""Grumman (now Northrop Grumman (NOC)) was delighted with the publicity we gave the A-6,"" he said, ""and when Time magazine came out with a story about how we had saved a plane that was on the verge of cancellation, the CEO sent us a signed copy thanking us.""In March 1967 he went on his second combat deployment as a lieutenant on the carrier Forrestal.Disaster hit four months later as the ship's planes prepared for a raid on North Vietnam. An electrical surge discharged a rocket on the flight deck, sparking a chain reaction of bomb explosions that killed 134; one survivor was Lt. Cmdr. and future Sen. John McCain.""On a carrier, there's nowhere to run from fire, and I saw some sailors run into it to save others while 5-foot-2 mess cooks were pushing 500-pound bombs over the side,"" Zlatoper recalled. ""They were as brave as any Medal of Honor winner, while guys who had been bragging about how great they'd be in a crisis were noticeably absent.""Back in the States in 1970, Zlatoper finally got hitched, with the marriage producing a daughter who's now a pediatrician and a son who's an ad executive.Advanced education followed. Zlatoper graduated from the Naval War College in Newport, R.I., in 1973, then earned a master's degree in management from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. From there he used his new knowledge at Naval Operations in Washington, D.C., as program coordinator for guided and air-launched weapons.During his 12 years in Washington, Zlatoper implemented seven management systems that were fashionable at the time:""All of them had four things in common — have a goal, make a plan, work hard and, most important, take care of your people. The rest was flossed up to sell books.""Back on water, he rose to captain and took charge of an air wing comprised of nine squadrons on the carrier America.Up The ChainBy 1983, Zlatoper was back in D.C. as an aide to Army Maj. Gen. Colin Powell, who was helping Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger load President Reagan's military buildup.Five years later, Zlatoper was made a one-star rear admiral and chief of staff to the commander of the 7th Fleet, based in Japan.This gave him the chance to manage large numbers of sailors.When Operation Desert Storm ignited in January 1991, Zlatoper commanded a carrier group in the Persian Gulf and pulled an early trigger.Two hours before the air phase started, his ships fired cruise missiles toward Iraq so they would land in time.""These had never been tested in war before,"" he said.According to James Kitfield in ""Prodigal Soldiers,"" the Navy had intelligence that Iraq would try to hide its ships in Iran, much as it had done with its air force.""Those boats had helped lay thousands of mines and represented a future threat to international shipping in the Persian Gulf,"" Kitfield wrote. Zlatoper's A-6 Intruders caught the flotilla sneaking out of the Bubiyan Channel late at night and destroyed nearly all of them, during the entire war sinking 100 Iraqi vessels.""Up AgainZlatoper had kept up his flying credentials and went out on one more mission a few weeks into the operation to lift his total to 151.""As far as we knew, Iraq had strong defenses, and yet everyone went out without hesitation, which is an answer to those who say America has gone soft,"" he said.His carrier became a major source of information for his boss, based in Saudi Arabia, and the brass in D.C. about what was happening because he had rigged up a special antenna to get CNN broadcasts direct feeds from Baghdad.In November 1991, Zlatoper was promoted to vice admiral and made deputy chief of naval operations in charge of personnel. That meant wielding an ax.""We had to draw down the Navy from 700,000 to less than 500,000 without breaking faith with our people,"" Zlatoper said. ""You can't just let the oldest guys go or you'd lose invaluable experience. We encouraged those who had been serving for 20 years to take early retirement and lowered our recruiting. It was painful, but it worked well.""An aide — Terry McKnight, who went on to become a rear admiral and write ""Pirate Alley"" — lauded his old boss: ""Zap was a real class act who taught me how to be a leader and an officer and changed how I approached the rest of my career. He told me never to get mad at anyone and remember that it's easy to say no, while you have to work hard to say yes.""In August 1994, Zlatoper hit the crest of the Navy: four-star admiral and commander of the Pacific Fleet, headquartered at Pearl Harbor. His 200,000 sailors and 190 ships helped maintain peace with 45 nations.A year after retiring in January 1997, Zlatoper took over Sanchez Computer Associates, steering the banking software firm's market cap from $50 million to $1 billion.Then he became chairman of James Campbell Estate, a trust that has more than $2 billion in real estate holdings, including in Kapolei, a city in Hawaii trying to rival downtown Honolulu as an urban center.Zlatoper plans to wrap up his work there in a year while locking in his next project: education.

751,NOC,"Investors may have to wait years for some companies to pay higher dividends, but that's not the case with Lockheed Martin (LMT).The Bethesda, Md.-based firm has rewarded investors with big dividend raises for more than a decade. In late September, Lockheed bumped up its quarterly dividend by 16% to $1.33 a share from $1.15. That marked the 11th straight double-digit increase. Lockheed's quarterly dividend has more than doubled in three years.Lockheed pays a dividend of $5.32 a share on an annual basis, which works out to a yield of about 3.8%, or nearly 150 basis points higher than the S&P 500's yield. Lockheed has the second-highest yield among 27 dividend-paying stocks in the Aerospace/Defense group. The company strives to return at least 50% of free cash flow to stockholders through dividends and share buybacks.While the company has delivered steady top- and bottom-line growth in recent years, it announced plans last month to cut 4,000 jobs and close factories due to slowing U.S. defense spending. Last year, sales to the U.S. government accounted for 82% of total sales. It's hoping that sales of its F-35 fighter jets to foreign buyers will help make up for the lower defense spending at home.The company's full-year earnings are expected to rise 15% to $9.68 a share this year. Growth is slated to slow to 5% in 2014.Lockheed is pulling back in light trade from a strong rebound off its 10-week line. The stock has been on a tear since breaking out from a first-stage cup-with-handle base in late March.Most of its weekly gains lately have come in above-average volume. It hasn't had a down week in heavy trade in about two months.Lockheed is one of the highest-rated stocks in the Aerospace/Defense group. Rival Northrop Grumman (NOC) is another highly rated stock in the group. It's trading tightly near an all-time high. Lockheed has a 91 Composite Rating, while Northrop has a 96.

754,NOC,"Boeing (BA) is unlikely to deliver its first batch of refueling tankers to the Air Force by August 2017, according to a Pentagon office.The agency has ""low confidence in Boeing’s ability” to meet the deadline, the first major requirement of the $51 billion program, the Defense Contract Management Agency told Bloomberg.The new deadline for 18 KC-46 tankers is March 2018, seven months late, and the plane could fall even more behind schedule. Boeing has failed to meet other deadlines. The initial test flight was six months late and the second was four months late.Mark Bobbi, an aerospace, defense and security analyst at consultancy IHS, said the Air Force could be trying to keep pressure on Boeing to finish development as the company hasn’t had any major technical issues with the plane for the past several months.“I believe if they miss delivery, it will be by a few to half a dozen units of the initial tranche,” he said in an email.The Air Force could penalize Boeing for the delay, and the company will likely absorb more costs. Its fixed-cost contract with the Pentagon requires Boeing to cover overruns.Boeing expects the development phase to cost $5.59 billion, or $766 million over budget. The company has already assumed over $800 million in after-tax charges on the plane due to higher-than-estimated engineering and manufacturing costs.Boeing shares fell 0.5% in the stock market today.The KC-46 is a military version of the 767 commercial aircraft already in production and is expected to replace Boeing's KC-135 tankers.Analysts earlier speculated that Boeing's failure to hit milestones with the tanker was one of the major reasons Northrop Grumman (NOC) was awarded the lucrative B-21 bomber contract last year instead of the Boeing-Lockheed Martin (LMT) team.Lockheed Martin stock slid 0.2% while Northop edged up 0.1%.
"
755,NOC,"ARLINGTON, Va. -- Lockheed Martin (LMT) said Tuesday it was ""optimistic"" about closing a deal for nearly 160 F-35s and is upbeat on cost reductions.Jeff Babione, the defense contractor's F-35 program general manager, said he expects talks for production lots 9 and 10 to be completed by the end of the month.""We are happy with how they are going,"" he said, though a decision on the production lots had been delayed due to the ""scale and complexity"" of the orders.The lots being negotiated are for 157 F-35 fighters, more than double the 71 airplanes under lots 6 and 7.Meanwhile, the Pentagon already has reached a deal with United Technologies (UTX) for 167 Pratt & Whitney engines in the upcoming F-35 lots.The F-35 is under fire for being over budget and behind schedule. Right now, the jet costs about $100 million each to make, but Lockheed thinks it can lower cost to $85 million in 2019.Babione touted the use of robots to help drive down costs. Engineers are using a robot to apply a coating on the fuselage, saving $6,000 per jet for a lifetime savings of $27 million. And robots are attaching nut plates with an estimated savings of $15,000 per plane or $46 million for the life of the program.But the biggest savings would come from a 450-jet bulk order, or block buy, which Babione estimates would provide $2 billion in savings, in addition to those seen from robots and other efficiencies.Lockheed had hoped for a block buy starting in 2018, but the Defense Department’s new budget request doesn’t include early funding or seek authorization for one. The Pentagon's chief weapons tester has said a block buy could mean large batches of faulty planes could enter service that will need several expensive fixes, resulting in no net cost savings.But partner countries and foreign military-sale customers could still start a block buy in 2018, without the U.S., if they let Lockheed know by June or July, Babione said.The price could fall even further, as Pratt & Whitney also is building the engines for Northrop Grumman’s (NOC) B-21 bomber.Lockheed shares closed up 0.5% in the stock market today. Northrop shares ended flat. United Tech shares climbed 1.25%.Amid the F-35 production, Lockheed is looking past its next-generation fighter and toward hypersonic propulsion.CEO Marillyn Hewson said the company is making progress with its hypersonic systems and could develop, build and fly a demonstrator aircraft the size of an F-22 for under $1 billion.""We’re now producing a controllable, low-drag, aerodynamic configuration capable of stable operation from take-off, to sub-sonic, trans-sonic, super-sonic, and hypersonic to Mach 6,"" she said.
"
756,NOC,"ARLINGTON, Va. -- Lockheed Martin (LMT) believes laser weapons are ""coming of age"" and ready for use as a cheaper option against the Islamic State and other terrorist groups that employ inexpensive but deadly weapons.Last year, Lockheed tested its new Athena (Advanced Test High Energy Asset) weapon, which uses a 30-kw fiber laser, by disabling a small Phantom quadcopter drone's engine and camera with precision at over a mile away. Each shot cost less than a dollar.The system can also bore a hole though two-inch steel, such as the engine of a truck,  in seconds.""The military doesn’t have a cost-effective defense against these rockets and small UAVs that are low and slow and very, very small,"" said Paul Shattuck, director of directed energy systems, at Lockheed's media day Tuesday.  ""But laser weapons can change that.""The fight against the Islamic State is proving to be costly. Each Tomahawk land-attack cruise missile costs over $1.5 million. Smart bombs cost upwards of $25,000 each. The Air Force has dropped over 20,000 missiles and bombs in its campaign against the Islamic State.Lockheed is also working on more powerful lasers that could be used against larger targets and replace expensive missiles. The company is on track to deliver a 60-kw fiber laser for field-testing for the Army later this year.Shattuck said that laser weapons don't require much more tech innovation. Instead, engineers are working on incorporating the weapons onto existing platforms.Past lasers were inefficient due to their large size, large power demand, and inability to cool. Boeing's (BA) YAL-1 Airborne Laser, a megawatt chemical laser system built in 2002, was mounted inside a modified Boeing 747.Lockheed's new 60-kw laser can be mounted on a truck.Northrop Grumman (NOC) built a roughly 100 kw solid-state laser for use on warships in 2009.But Lockheed claims its new electric fiber lasers use 50% less electricity than Northrop's, and Shattuck believes that building a 150-kw laser would be ""straight forward.""Lockheed shares closed up 0.5% in the stock market today. Northrop shares changed little, while Boeing shares rose 1%.

757,NOC,"These are turning out to be prosperous times for long-time Pentagon supplier Northrop Grumman.Northrop (NOC) can restart work on its new, potentially lucrative long-range strike bomber, after Boeing’s (BA) protest of the contract’s award was denied last week.Production is increasing for several key programs of which the aerospace giant has been a part, thus ensuring that it has business for several years to come.And while rising tensions with China and Russia may be bad news for international relations, they ultimately could boost demand for other Northrop offerings.""Northrop is a well-balanced company that’s tightly managed and focuses on its niche offerings and (is) not diversified too far outside that,"" said Richard Pettibone, aerospace and defense analyst at Forecast International.In October, Northrop beat out a team of Boeing and Lockheed Martin (LMT) to develop the long-range strike bomber, the last major airframe contract expected to be issued by the Pentagon for the next decade.  The Air Force hopes to get funding for 80 to 100 of the new planes.If it passes, the production contract would be worth $50 billion to $80 billion. The planes would replace the Boeing B-52 bombers, which last year entered their seventh decade of service.Air Force Secretary Deborah James said that Northrop’s development bid was the ""best value"" for the nation. Mark Bobbi, a defense analyst at consultancy IHS, said, ""(Northrop) has the best chance of executing on this bomber program than any company in the world""; he estimates that the contract will add $300 million-$400 million to Northrop’s top line this year.There's always a caveat with defense contracts, though. Northrop has yet to win a production deal. And there’s always the chance that the bomber program will be cancelled, particularly if the cost exceeds forecasts of $564 million per aircraft. A previous bomber program was cancelled suddenly in 2009.Due to the deal’s secretive nature, details as to exactly why Northrop won development of the bomber won’t be released to the public. Bobbi speculates that Northrop won because of its legacy with the B-2 stealth bomber and its track record with the E-2D Hawkeye radar aircraft for the Navy. There's also the perception that Northrop's integration, subsystems and supply chain are better than its competitors’.Along with the strike bomber and the Global Hawk unmanned surveillance aircraft -- another key contract -- Northrop is a supplier for Lockheed’s F-35 next-generation fighter jets. The ramp-up in production of the F-35 and the extension of Northrop’s F/A-18 Super Hornet combat jet for the Navy and Marine Corps will also help Northrop’s top line this year.On top of all that, the Air Force is expected to make a decision next year about the $10 billion T-X trainer jet program with contract proposals to replace its 500 T-38 jets due in the fourth quarter. Northrop, Boeing, Lockheed and Raytheon (RTN) all have thrown their hats into the ring. But Pettibone said that it’s unlikely Northrop would win the contract as the Pentagon is expected to consider the industrial base when offering the contract and would want to spread the work out.Still, the Unmanned Carrier-Launched Airborne Surveillance and Strike (UCLASS) drone is up for grabs, and the Navy awarded four preliminary design contracts in 2014 to Boeing, General Atomics, Lockheed Martin and Northrop. A front runner has yet to emerge on the program.Further, Northrop specializes in next-generation radar, expected to be a priority for the services going forward.Northrop is part of IBD’s Aerospace/Defense group along with peers Boeing, Lockheed and Raytheon. It also makes sensors and radar, missile and navigation systems.The company’s total backlog at the end of 2015 was $35.9 billion vs. $38.2 billion at the end of 2014. It got $5.8 billion in new awards in the fourth quarter. Looking ahead, the company sees full-year EPS of $9.90-$10.20 on sales of $23.5 billion-$24 billion. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect EPS of $10.49 on sales of $24.47 billion.Northrop says that it sells products and services to customers in 25 nations. But international sales are only roughly 15% of Northrop’s total revenue, as the U.S. services continue to be its main customer. In the 2017 budget request, the Defense Department asked for $582.7 billion in military funding, with $523.9 billion in base budget funding and $58.8 billion in overseas contingency operations funding. The main military request is up 0.4% from the 2016 budget of $580.3 billion.The U.S. defense budget is likely to stay at current levels no matter who wins the 2016 presidential election, Chris Higgins of Morningstar told IBD. He says that the election outcome should have “marginal effects” on defense spending.The risk of sequestration has also been mitigated, and there is little appetite to cut defense anymore, Pettibone says, as hot spots around the world erupt.The fight against terrorism, particularly the Islamic State, isn't as much an advantage to Northrop as it is to Raytheon and Lockheed, since Northrop deals less in precision missile-guidance sales.But Bobbi says that rising tensions with Russia and China will help the company as countries raise their defense budgets. He said that Eastern European nations have raised their defense budgets by a combined 20% in the past year. International sales had been a focal point for defense contractors after domestic sales were curbed during sequestration.Still there are risks for Northrop. For one, there are fewer U.S. contract awards to go around, so the defense industry could be heading towards another round of consolidation like that seen in the 1990s when when Lockheed merged with Martin Marietta, Northrop bought Grumman, and Boeing purchased McDonnell Douglas.Analysts say that a smaller industrial base could actually cut costs, as the current fragmented defense sector creates inefficiencies. But the Pentagon is pushing for more power to block defense mergers and preserve competition. It is asking Congress for a stronger hand when it comes to industry dealmaking.""I think the Defense Department would resist that with its entire essence,"" Bobbi said of the prospect of Boeing buying Northrop. ""You take out another prime contractor and put it under the wing of one that doesn’t have a stellar track record.""Pettibone, however, cautions to ""never say never"" about consolidation. Still, he sees further mergers as unlikely unless government regulators are content with having only two major players left, Boeing and Lockheed.""Northrop will continue to be a constant and conservative player in the defense industry,"" Pettibone said. ""Management has planned for this environment and has the company going in eyes wide open to capitalize on the defense market going forward.""

GE lost 0.6%. Northrop shares fell 2.3%. Rockwell dipped 0.7%, Spirit closed down 2.7% and Orbital ATK fell 2.6%.Boeing shares closed up 1.5% to 122.90. Lockheed shares fell 1.3% to 215.84.James said there was a ""balancing act"" in sharing information with the public but also protecting information against cyber and other threats. The information about the subcontractors was released only after the companies had protection plans in place.""With the B-21 we are leaning forward and trying to be more transparent,"" she said.Lt. Gen. Arnold Bunch, military deputy in Air Force acquisition, said the service would continue to be transparent with Congress about the program after Sen. John McCain threatened to block the bomber as long as it was was procured using a cost-plus contract.Bunch wouldn't give contract value or incentive amounts but said he would disclose more information about the bomber as it becomes available.

761,NOC,"The Marine Corps Commandant wants Lockheed Martin (LMT) to hurry up with the F-35's software development, which will enable additional capabilities on the next-generation stealth fighter.At a House Appropriations Committee hearing Tuesday, Gen. Robert Neller said that while the F-35 is ""aeronautically sound,"" he has ""concerns about where the software was"" and wants Lockheed to ""go faster.""Neller said the F-35 needs the 3F software and will hold the vendor accountable for that. An updated 3F version of the software will give the F-35 full war-fighting capabilities next year, including the ability to fire the plane's 25-millimeter Gatling gun.As of May 2015, 97.5% of the required F-35 software is currently flying and 99.9% of the required software has been coded, according to Lockheed's website. But about 10,000 lines of code still need to be written.The Marines F-35B variant was declared combat-ready in July and is set for deployment to Japan in early 2017.Neller is still confident in the aircraft, saying it will get better as development continues and that his pilots are ""very positive and very excited"" about the plane.But last month, a top Air Force official said the service might have to delay declaring its F-35A variant combat-ready unless issues with the software were worked out. The Air Force has an Aug. 1 target date set for the F-35A’s initial operating capability.But the Air Force's fighter reached a milestone toward combat readiness recently. The service said that the F-35A dropped bombs for the first time in training last week at Hill Air Force Base in Utah.Lockheed shares rose 1.1% in the stock market today. United Technologies (UTX), whose Pratt & Whitney makes the F-35 engines, fell 1.6%. Northrop Grumman (NOC), another major F-35 supplier, rose 0.9%.

762,NOC,"The Air Force said Friday its new stealth bomber to be built by Northrop Grumman (NOC) will be called the B-21 and released an image for the future plane that closely resembles the company's B-2 bomber.Few details have been revealed about the secretive program, which should include 80-100 aircraft at a cost of $50 billion-$80 billion. The bomber will replace decades-old Boeing (BA) B-52s.But obstacles to the B-21's progress have recently been lifted, and additional details will come out, including information about subcontractors that's expected next month.Earlier this month, the Government Accountability Office found “no basis” to sustain or uphold Boeing's challenge to the bomber contract, allowing Northrop to resume work on it.Northrop won the bomber deal in October, but Boeing and teammate Lockheed Martin (LMT) issued a formal protest soon after, saying the Air Force’s decision was “fundamentally flawed.”Boeing also won't take legal action on the contract. Boeing spokesman Todd Blecher said Friday the company stands behinds the issues it raised in the protest but won't pursue any further challenges either through the GAO or federal court.Boeing shares closed up 1.15% in the stock market today. Northrop shares dipped 0.4%, and Lockheed slipped 0.5%.But bomber program still faces political hurdles. Earlier this week, Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain said he would block the Air Force from using a cost-plus contract because it makes the government, not the company, responsible for cost overruns.Currently, the Air Force is using a cost-plus contract for the engineering and development phased of the new bomber, while the production of the first five sets of the plane would use a firm contract.

776,NOC,"Shares of Northrop Grumman (NOC) are forming a new base, the byproduct of a resilient stock performance while the general market contracts.A 12-week flat base shows a potential buy point at 194.09. The pattern does have a soft underbelly, however, with three weeks in which shares fell and closed near weekly lows in above-average volume.Still, Northrop has plenty of institutional muscle behind it. More than 1,500 mutual and hedge funds own its shares, including dozens that IBD rates A- or better.While it's not typically thought of as a technology stock, Northrop is no stranger to whiz-bang innovation.In December, for example, it won a contract worth up to $91 million from the U.S. Navy to develop a high-energy laser weapon to defend its warships. The new crown jewel is the long-range bomber for the U.S. Air Force, a contract worth $50 billion to $80 billion for up to 100 new aircraft.Boeing (BA), which lost out on the contract, has challenged the decision. The Air Force is standing by Northrop Grumman. The Government Accountability Office is expected to rule on the bomber protest by Feb. 16.In the third-quarter report, earnings rose 22%, while sales were flat. The company's aerospace business — the largest by revenue — saw gains thanks to higher production in military aircraft such as the F-35 stealth fighter and the E-2D Advanced Hawkeye, an airborne radar platform, helping offset fewer F/A-18 deliveries.Unmanned aircraft is a growing field, and Northrop is seeing higher sales of its Triton and Global Hawk UAVs.Northrop will report Q4 earnings on Jan. 28.

778,NOC,"The Air Force is reportedly pushing back the retirement date of its well-armed and heavily armored A-10 Warthog, meaning Lockheed Martin (LMT) will have to wait a bit longer before it becomes a bigger player in close-range combat.Defense officials told Defense One that the A-10 Warthog had become essential to the fight against ISIS, which has grown in Iraq and Syria and upended the military's plans a few years ago to devote more resources to the F-35.The new plan to delay the plane's retirement will be outlined in the Pentagon's 2017 budget request to Congress, Defense One said. The final budget plan is still being worked out, Defense One said.The Air Force had wanted to retire the A-10 — which has been in service for around 40 years and has its share of supporters on Congress — before or around 2021. Doing so would allow the U.S. to allocate more finances toward the F-35, which is set to take over its role, Defense One said.The F-35, meanwhile, has faced a variety of technical and budgeting setbacks, concerns about its maneuverability vs. other jets, and its ability to sustain damage in battle. What's more, the F-35 is a sleeker stealth fighter, while the A-10 wasn't designed with sleekness in mind. In tests set for 2018, the military will compare and contrast the F-35's abilities against those of the A-10.Shares of Lockheed Martin rose 0.9% in the stock market today. The defense contractor, in a partnership with Boeing (BA), last year lost out to Northrop Grumman (NOC) in a bid for a huge contract to build the Air Force's long-range strike bomber.Northrop climbed 0.4%, and Boeing rose 0.8% in Thursday trade.Follow Bill Peters on Twitter @IBD_BPeters.

They're not as reliable as primary buy points, such as a breakout on volume from a sound base. But secondary buy points can be used to add a small number of shares to a successful position.Actavis (ACT) moved upward out of a three-weeks-tight pattern Friday with a 166.42 buy point, but volume was only average.

But suppliers are also helping slash the costs.On Tuesday, United Technologies' (UTX) Pratt & Whitney division said that the next two rounds of engines for the jet, the seventh and eighth batches, are expected to be 7%-8% cheaper than the prior one, on top of a 50% savings from earlier batches.The government buys the engines separately from Pratt & Whitney. The engine has been a headache for the program after the plane had to be grounded due to an engine fire at a Florida air base in June. But earlier this month, officials said that an engine fix is near.In July, F-35 suppliers BAE Systems and Northrop Grumman (NOC) said that they would spend $170 million to implement cost-cutting measures that should result in savings of $1.8 billion.Other plans to cut costs include offering ""block buys"" to the U.K., Australia, Italy and other countries with orders on the books.Lockheed shares rose 0.6% to 180.59 on the stock market today.The Aerospace/Defense group is ranked No. 72 out of the 197 industry groups that IBD tracks.Follow Gillian Rich on Twitter at @IBD_GRich.

819,NOC,"Leroy Grumman was an unlikely player in a game dominated by barnstormers and daredevils, the jaunty young men with pencil mustaches who built America's aviation industry right after World War I.Stoop-shouldered and soft-spoken, Grumman was as shy as he was inseparable from the briar pipe he seemed to hide behind.His experience as a military pilot had left no apparent mark. ""He was very, very reticent,"" his flight instructor said. ""Most of the guys became tougher than hell after they learned to fly. Grumman didn't.""No matter. Grumman had partners who mastered swagger. He focused on designing aircraft so reliable that many models flew largely unchanged through their life span, winning his Long Island plant the nickname Grumman Iron Works.As Vice Adm. John McCain Sr. put it during World War II: ""The name Grumman on a plane is like sterling on silver.""BoomOver four decades, Grumman would build his firm from 16 employees into one of the nation's largest defense contractors, with divisions that manufactured prop planes, jet aircraft, rockets, even canoes and delivery trucks.On July 21, 1969, the world watched tensely as his aeronautic magnum opus delivered Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin to the moon.Northrop Grumman (NOC) is still on the rise, with $24.4 billion in sales last year and a stock that has taken flight by 290% since 2009.Leroy Randle Grumman (1895-1982) was born in Huntington, N.Y., the son of a carriage-shop owner. Roy, as he preferred to be called, had a clear interest in the infant aviation industry by the time he finished high school, telling classmates, ""the final perfection of the airplane"" would be one of man's greatest triumphs.Grumman graduated with an engineering degree from Cornell University in 1916 and applied to the U.S. Navy flight program just as America entered World War I.He served as a flight instructor and test pilot, and, at war's end in 1918, took a job at aviation pioneer Grover Loening's New York City factory.Grumman became fast friends with another Loening employee, Jake Swirbul, an organizational whiz with whom he shared a work ethic and love of flight.When the Loening operation announced a move to Pennsylvania in 1929, the pals took off on their own. Grumman Aeronautical Engineering opened in a former car dealership in the Long Island hamlet of Baldwin on Jan. 2, 1930, with Grumman as chairman and president.Initially, the firm specialized in repairing Loening aircraft, but Grumman soon used his military contacts to land work building pontoons for Navy planes and then a contract for a bi-winged fighter, the first with retractable landing gear.Still, times were tough. The company ran out of cash one week and sent workers home without pay.Scraping ByEarly on, the firm could afford test-flight insurance only by the hour, and company lore suggests employees were encouraged to lug in scrap metal from the roadside.While other companies invested in sophisticated inventory systems, Grumman piled parts into spent oil drums, each marked with a red line a few inches from the bottom. ""When it gets to here,"" a sign advised workers, ""call Joe.""But it was just the kind of company Grumman wanted: small, paternalistic and, if all went well, profitable. In that order.Despite its founder's misgivings, the firm grew steadily, moving to larger quarters in 1931, then again the next year and once more in 1937. Grumman still insisted that the firm should be kept lean and nimble, with no more than 250 workers. An accountant was finally dispatched to tell the boss that the staff had reached 256.Even so, Grumman ruled in a folksy, feet-on-the-desk, door-always-open style, although Swirbul did most of what he called the ""mollycoddling"" of employees.As a result, workers referred to Swirbul as Jake, but Grumman was always Mr. Grumman.Production soared in 1939 as France and England placed orders for Grumman's F-4F Wildcat, a stubby, teardrop-shaped fighter that could reach 330 mph.By 1943, with America in the WWII fight, the Grumman workforce had ballooned from a prewar 700 to more than 25,000, and the company was the primary supplier of aircraft to the Allies.Giving 'Em HellThe firm's next fighter model, the faster F-6 Hellcat, would rule the skies in the Pacific theater, where it was credited with destroying two-thirds of all Japanese planes.The plane's speed and maneuverability were part of the success story, but sheer quantity played an important role as well. At peak production, the company was cranking out over 600 aircraft a month, and Grumman's unique folding wing design, which he'd worked out using an eraser and two paper clips, let U.S. aircraft carriers double the number of planes on board.With Grumman stationed at the drafting table, Swirbul took over the morale effort, organizing activities for workers such as ice-cream socials, band performances and pingpong tournaments. At one point, the firm had over 40 softball teams, with Grumman and other executives playing alongside the most junior riveters.""Grumman was like Michelangelo, and Swirbul was the guy who cut the marble for him,"" one executive said. ""Jake knew how to give the schmaltz to the people.""Sales jumped from $4 million in 1940 to $400 million in 1943, with a percentage going to workers as bonuses. As a result, the company's labor turnover was half that of other wartime manufacturers, and its profit more than double.As World War II ended in 1945, Grumman faced one of his greatest engineering challenges — reducing the staff by 20,000, of which only 126 had expressed any interest in leaving. His solution: Fire everyone, then rehire 5,000 of the most talented and longest tenured. The company pulled it off in 10 days.Grumman stepped down as president in 1946 after losing much of his eyesight from an allergic reaction to a penicillin shot. But he continued on as chairman for 20 more years, pushing the firm into civilian products that included aluminum canoes, delivery vans and Gulfstream prop planes and jets.Government work remained the firm's mainstay, with Grumman winning contracts to produce Navy jets and reconnaissance planes, Postal Service vans and, in 1962, NASA's lunar excursion module.""None of the industry founders got in it for the military business, but none ever turned away from weaponry,"" Wayne Biddle , a Johns Hopkins professor and author of ""Barons of the Sky,"" told IBD. ""They all cherished a necessarily primitive dream of civilian aviation — an airplane in every garage — that turned out to be technically and economically infeasible. So the government became their most reliable customer, with commercial aviation a perennial roller coaster.""Swirbul died from colon cancer in 1960, and Grumman went it alone for an additional six years before relinquishing the chairman's seat, although he remained a director until 1972. The Grumman workforce at that point had swelled to 35,000, surpassing World War II levels and making the company easily Long Island's largest employer.""Everyone talks about Grumman being a big family, and it was,"" said Mike Lisa, a 37-year company veteran. ""There were the top executives, of course, but from the vice presidents down, it was like everyone was an equal on the same playing field. That changed after Leroy retired and passed, but in those days it was a fantastic place to work. Just a great, great place.""Grumman split his retirement between Florida and New York with his wife, Rose, whom he'd married in 1921. They had four children. Grumman's eyesight continued to fail, however, and by 1980, he was blind.Two years later, after what was described as a long illness, he died at age 87.Grumman missed having to witness the decline of the firm he founded, which struggled amid Pentagon cutbacks after the Cold War and sold out to Northrop in 1994, a merger that many defense experts believed should have yielded a Grumman Northrop.It was the confirmation of Grumman's greatest fear, according to his widow. Roy's company, Rose Grumman said, had simply ""got too big.""Said Biddle: ""The lucrative products that epitomized the industry after Leroy Grumman left it would have disgusted him, I think. And by the end of his life, the best young engineers weren't going into aerospace, which was perceived as old-fashioned and corrupt. They were heading for Silicon Valley.""

868,NOC,"Be true to yourself. It's not just a good way to live. If you live up to your principles, others will trust you more. Here's how to win the faith of your colleagues:• Open up. Tell others about yourself. You'll build credibility and win trust, says Jim Kouzes, co-author of  ""The Leadership Challenge."" Get others to do it, too.Opening up might mean interjecting bits about your background during meetings or talking about what matters to you. Once you start, your team will follow the trend. ""The more people feel comfortable sharing information, the more engaged they are,"" Kouzes told IBD.• Be genuine. Get people to buy into your message. They're likelier to believe you support a project if you act like it. ""If they don't believe in the messenger, they don't believe the message,"" said Kouzes, an executive fellow at Santa Clara University's business school.• Click. Be authentic when you communicate, or people will see right through you and you'll lose their faith. David Horsager, a St. Paul, Minn.-based trust and leadership consultant and author of  ""The Trust Edge,"" once told his staff that he would lose 50 pounds by May 1. His biggest concern if he missed his goal? ""I would've lost my team that day.""• Be consistent. Don't try to be someone you're not just to satisfy the crowd. Stick to your principles.People want predictability from their leaders. ""Offer the best you as a leader, and you'll have much more rabid fans,"" Horsager said.• Get the ball rolling. If you want others to be open and honest, show them how to do it. Kouzes tells a story about Ron Sugar, former CEO of Northrop Grumman (NOC). He once greeted employees at the start of a big meeting by playing the piano. He wanted people to know a little more about him, and it helped boost their trust in him.""That lets people know who you are, what you believe in and what's important to you,"" Kouzes said.• Dive in. Model the actions you seek. Steve Skarke runs a plant for Kaneka Texas Corp., whose products are used in the plastics industry. He wanted the place to look world-class, but saw too much litter at the site. He wrote ""world-class plant"" on a bucket and walked around, filling it with trash. He got his message across. Others pitched in to clean up. ""Credibility is doing what you say you'll do,"" Kouzes said. ""It's not until people see the leader doing those things that they realize the importance of it.""• Get the edge. If people trust you and know that you're genuine, they'll give you the benefit of the doubt, Horsager says. He's working with a company president whose firm is struggling. In other circumstances, the boss might be fired. But the board knows from past experience that the president recognizes the problem and is committed to fixing it.• Set principles.When Kouzes works with firms, he often pulls out a deck of 52 cards, each with a different principle, such as teamwork. He asks each person to pick their top five. That helps people realize what's important to their co-workers and makes it easier to gel as a team. ""We tend to trust the people we know more than the people we don't know,"" he said.• Give both sides. Even if things go smoothly, tell others about what's going badly, too. ""People who never show challenges or fears don't appear genuine,"" Horsager said.

907,NOC,"The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) and Embraer S.A. (ERJ  -  Free Report) have recently entered into a joint venture (JV) by signing a Memorandum of Understanding, which would offer the former a controlling stake at Embraer’s commercial jet business. Per the terms of the transaction, Boeing will hold an 80% ownership stake in the JV, whereas Embraer will own the remaining 20% stake.The non-binding agreement, signed by both the companies, values Embraer's commercial aircraft operations at $4.75 billion, with Boeing's stake in the JV worth $3.8 billion.Details of the AgreementIn particular, the JV proposes the strategic alignment of Embraer’s commercial aircraft and services business with Boeing's commercial development, production, marketing and lifecycle services operations.Once finalized, the JV will be led by Brazil-based management, while Boeing will have operational and management control of the same.The definitive agreement, including the financial and operational details pertaining to the partnership, is expected to get finalized in the upcoming months, subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, approval from the Government of Brazil and other customary closing conditions. Once approved, the entire transaction is expected to close by the end of 2019.Benefits of the Proposed Joint VentureThe commercial aviation JV represents the biggest realignment in the global aerospace market in decades, further strengthening Boeing’s commercial business’ against its arch rival Airbus (EADSY  -  Free Report) and the emerging aerospace companies from China, Russia and Japan. The proposed partnership is expected to be accretive to Boeing's earnings at the start of 2020 and generate estimated annual pre-tax cost synergies of approximately $150 million by the third year.The proposed joint venture clearly looks to establish a strategic partnership that will be beneficial for both the companies in bolstering their positions in the global commercial jet market. The venture aligns with Boeing's long-term strategy of investing in organic growth and returning value to shareholders, complemented by favorable strategic arrangements. On completion, this strategic alliance will offer a comprehensive commercial airplane portfolio ranging from 70-450 seats along with freighter aircraft, and best-in-class products and services to serve the global customer base.Further, the partnership is expected to improve Embraer’s cash position by approximately $1 billion once the deal closes, creating more investment opportunities in upcoming projects. This, in turn, will bolster the growth of the JV as well as that of Boeing, eventually.Another JV in the LineBoth Boeing and Embraer plan to create another JV for developing new markets and applications for various defense products and services, especially the KC-390 multi-mission military aircraft, based on jointly-identified opportunities. Additional investments in the global marketing of the KC-390 along with a series of agreements in the fields of engineering, research and development, and the supply chain will enhance both the companies’ footprint in the global military aircraft market.Our ViewOnce the commercial aviation JV agreement closes, both Boeing and Embraer will benefit from a broader operational scale, additional resources and worldwide footprint that will enable them to win more contracts from varied airlines across the globe. Notably, the strategic venture will offer stiffer competition to the C-Series jets designed by Canada's Bombardier Inc. and supported by Airbus.On the commercial front, Boeing estimates demand for 41,030 new planes, worth $6.1 trillion in the next two decades. These projections must have encouraged the two jet makers to strike such a strategic JV, which on completion should further allow Boeing to continue maintaining its position as the largest commercial jetliner manufacturer in the world.Price MovementBoeing’s stock rallied about 65% in a year compared with the industry’s growth of 27.8%. The outperformance was primarily led by the robust worldwide demand for its commercial aircraft and military jets.Zacks Rank & Key PickBoeing currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Another top-ranked stock in the same space is Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report), which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

908,NOC,"Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc.’s (HII  -  Free Report) business segment, Newport News, recently secured a modification contract to purchase additional long lead time material for supporting the USS Enterprise (CVN 80). Work related to the deal is scheduled to be over by February 2027.Valued at $200.4 million, the contract was awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington Navy Yard, Washington, D.C. The company will utilize fiscal 2018 shipbuilding and conversion (Navy) fund to finance the task, which will be executed in Newport News, VA.A Brief Note on USS EnterpriseThe USS Enterprise (CVN 80), Gerald R. Ford class’ third aircraft carrier, bears the name of the Navy’s first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, USS Enterprise (CVN 65).Once CVN 80 enters service, it will replace the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower (CVN 69) — a Nimitz-class ship. Currently, advanced fabrication of CVN 80 is underway, for which the company expects to witness contracting activity by 2020 end.The air wing of this new USS Enterprise will be capable of supporting more than 75 aircraft of varied kinds, including fixed-wing and rotary-wing systems. Moreover, an Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS) will be incorporated in the ship to replace the steam catapults of the older versions.Our ViewHuntington Ingalls is one of the largest military shipbuilders in the country. Over 70% of the active Navy fleet consists of its ships. Notably, this military shipbuilder’s Newport News division is the nation’s sole designer, builder and refueler of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers. It also offers one of only two shipyards capable of designing and building nuclear-powered submarines.Moreover, it is imperative to mention that Huntington Ingalls’ shipbuilding business outlook remains upbeat, considering the fiscal 2019 budget that has been approved recently by the U.S. Senate. Per the latest financial plan, major war fighting investments includes spending plans of $18.3 billion on Shipbuilding. Also, incremental funding for nuclear aircraft carriers — CVN-79 and CVN-80 — is a part of the fiscal 2019 budget.No doubt, one of the prime beneficiaries of this new spending proposal will be Huntington Ingalls. For more than 100 years, this company has been building ships, aircraft carriers and submarines for the U.S. Navy at the shipyards in Virginia and Mississippi.  Considering such optimistic budget allocation, we may expect Huntington Ingalls to win more such contracts involving its combat-proven military warships in days ahead.Price MovementIn a year’s time, Huntington Ingalls’ shares have gained about 16.5% compared with the industry’s 30.2% rally. The underperformance may have been caused by huge debt levels that the company bears, with the current market situation in the United States being in favor of increasing interest rates. Zacks Rank & Stocks to Consider    Huntington Ingalls currently has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).A few better-ranked stocks in the same space are Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report), Textron (TXT  -  Free Report) and Wesco Aircraft Holdings (WAIR  -  Free Report).

909,NOC,"Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) Aeronautics business unit recently won an $86.8 million five-year contact to support the Iraqi Air Force’s fleet of C-130J aircraft. The contract was awarded by the Air Force Life Cycle Management, Robins Air Force Base, GA.Details of the DealPer the terms of the deal, Lockheed Martin will provide support services to the Iraqi Air Force that includes contractor logistics support, technical assistance, aircraft and aerospace ground equipment, spares, repairs, and familiarization training on their existing six C-130J aircraft.Work related to the deal will be performed at Martyr Mohammed Ala Air Base, Iraq and is expected to get completed by Jun 30, 2022. Lockheed Martin will utilize foreign military sales funds for completing the tasks. The deal comes with a ceiling value of $100 million.Benefits of the C-130J Hercules AircraftThe C–130J Hercules is a medium-sized tactical transport airlift aircraft that is capable of performing a variety of combat delivery (tactical airlift) operations across a broad range of mission environments. These include the deployment and redeployment of troops, supplies within command areas in a theater of operation, aero-medical evacuation, air logistics support and augmentation of strategic airlift forces. The C-130J aircraft, with its extended fuselage, provides additional cargo carrying capacity for the Air Force combat delivery mission compared to the legacy C-130E/H and the C-130J (short) aircraft.What’s Favoring Lockheed Martin?Lockheed Martin's Aeronautics division remains focused on upgrading and providing enhanced support services for its legacy C-130 Hercules fleet, worldwide. In 2017, Lockheed Martin delivered 26 C-130J aircraft, of which seven were international deliveries. As of Dec 31, 2017, the company had 64 of these tactical aircraft in its backlog, a number we believe will increase in the coming days, courtesy of the latest contract clinched by the company.The Aeronautics division successfully delivered the 400th C-130J Super Hercules aircraft in the first quarter of 2018. Further, the overall performance of the C-130J program has been continuing to draw global demand with operators in 18 countries. Inevitably, we can expect the Aeronautics division to secure more similar contracts involving its C-130J jets in the days ahead.Furthermore, the recently approved fiscal 2019 defense budget includes a spending plan of $21.7 billion on aircraft. The budget proposal hints at a prospective increase in Lockheed Martin’s C-130J transport aircraft program that has been allotted $1.57 billion.Moreover, the 2018 Appropriations Act supported increased funding for 17 additional C-130J aircraft. These developments reflect solid growth prospects for Lockheed Martin’s C-130J program going ahead, which, in turn, are likely to boost the company’s profit margin.Price Movement    Lockheed Martin’s stock has improved about 5.3% in the last year compared with the industry’s growth of 27.4%.

910,NOC,"The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) recently secured a contract for the production and delivery of 22 F/A-18E and six F/A-18F Super Hornets to support the government of Kuwait. Work related to the deal is scheduled to be over by January 2021.Valued at $1.5 billion, the contract was awarded by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, Maryland. Majority of the order will be carried out in El Segundo, CA and Hazelwood, MO.The company will utilize foreign military sales fund to finance the task.Growing Demand for F/A-18Boeing’s F/A-18 Block III Super Hornet is a twin-engine, supersonic, all weather multirole fighter jet. Notably, it comes in two versions — the single-seat E model and the twin-seat F model.The company is continuously upgrading the Super Hornet program to outpace future threats. Also, Super Hornet’s radar, mission computers and sensors continue to evolve in order to meet extensive mission profiles. Due to the ever-rising worldwide demand of military aircraft, Boeing has developed the Advanced Block III Super Hornet. This fighter jet will complement existing and future air-wing capabilities, which include battle-space situational awareness, counter stealth targeting, increased acceleration and improved survivability.As a result, Boeing is witnessing strong demand for its fighter aircraft and major aerospace programs, including the F-18 aircraft. This is evident from the contract that it secured from Kuwait in the first quarter for delivering 28 F-18 Super Hornets.What’s Favoring Boeing?Boeing’s key forte lies in manufacturing combat-proven aircraft. It has inevitably secured large number of contracts from the Pentagon for long, courtesy of the company’s proven expertise in aerospace programs. Subsequently, revenues of its Defense, Space & Security (BDS) segment witnessed a 13% rise year over year to $5.76 billion in first-quarter 2018.We expect the latest contract along with a handful of other notable deals to help Boeing’s BDS segment deliver such solid performance in upcoming quarters as well.In this context it is imperative to mention that FMS contracts play a key role in driving Boeing’s operational performance. Evidently, the company’s backlog at BDS stood at $50 billion, 36% of which comprised orders from international clients.Interestingly, in terms of international sales for its F-18 fleet, the company enjoys a strong alliance with Kuwait. In fact, in June, Boeing won a $179 million contract for procuring system configuration set H12K to support Kuwait’s fleet of F/A-18E/F jets. Such contract wins along with the latest one should further strengthen Boeing’s relationship with Kuwait’s Air Force, thereby bolstering its position in the expanding military market overseas.  Meanwhile, the recently announced fiscal 2019 defense budget provisioned major war fighting investments of $21.7 billion for aircraft. It also included an investment plan of $2 billion for procuring 24 F/A-18Jets. Such proposed inclusions reflect solid growth prospects for the BDS segment, which in turn are likely to boost the company’s profit margin.Price MovementIn a year’s time, Boeing has rallied about 65.3% compared with the industry’s increase of 27.4%. The outperformance was primarily led by the robust worldwide demand for its commercial aircraft and military jets.Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to Consider     Boeing currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

911,NOC,"Northrop Grumman Corp.’s (NOC  -  Free Report) business segment, Aerospace Systems, recently clinched a modification contract related to the Airborne Laser Mine Detection System (ALMDS) program. Work related to this deal is scheduled to be over by June 2020.Details of the DealValued at $15.3 million, the contract was awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, District of Columbia. Per the terms of the agreement, the company will provide fabrication, integration, testing, system production and delivery of peculiar support equipment for the ALMDS program.Majority work for the contract will be executed in Melbourne, FL. Northrop Grumman will utilize fiscal 2018 other procurement (Navy) and fiscal 2017 other procurement (Navy) fund to finance the task.What’s ALMDS?The purpose of ALMDS is to detect, classify and localize near-surface, moored sea mines. Notably, it is integrated with Lockheed Martin’s MH-60S helicopter to offer rapid, wide-area reconnaissance and assessment of mine threats in littoral zones, confined straits, choke points and amphibious objective areas. ALMDS is also capable of day or night operations without stopping to stream out or recover equipment.In addition, it provides accurate target geo-location to support follow on neutralization of the detected mines.Our ViewInexpensive and easily deployable mines have been disrupting port and maritime operations as well as preventing naval forces from achieving sea control and power projection ashore. In this context, Northrop Grumman’s ALDMS plays an instrumental role by addressing the U.S. Navy’s immediate need to protect its sea-based assets from the ever-increasing threat of mines.In fact, we believe that Northrop Grumman possesses significant upside potential based on the U.S. government’s increased focus on intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) programs.In first-quarter 2018, revenues from the company’s Aerospace Systems unit totaled $3.28 billion, which increased 9.9% year over year. We believe the latest contract along with the other notable ones that the company has secured in recent times should allow its Aerospace Systems unit to reflect similar solid results in upcoming quarters as well.Moreover, the recently approved fiscal 2019 defense budget provisions for an investment plan of $13.7 billion for science and technology, including the ISR Programs. Considering such favorable budgetary revisions, we expect the company to win more such contracts, like the latest one, in the days ahead.Price Movement    In a year’s time, Northrop Grumman has gained about 21.8% compared with the industry’s rally of 29.5%. The underperformance may have been caused by higher operating expenses that the company has been incurring lately.Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to ConsiderNorthrop Grumman currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).  Some other top-ranked stocks in the same space include Boeing (BA  -  Free Report), Textron (TXT  -  Free Report) and Wesco Aircraft Holdings (WAIR  -  Free Report).

912,NOC,"Per major media releases, The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) recently won a $1.6 billion deal from New Zealand to deliver four P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol planes. The P8-A Poseidon planes will replace six aging Orion patrol planes, currently operated by the Royal New Zealand Air Force.Details of the DealPer the terms of the deal, Boeing will also provide training and infrastructure systems, apart from supplying the P-8A aircraft. The Royal New Zealand Air Force plans to take delivery of the planes and subsequently commence operations from 2023. Payments to Boeing for the deal will be made in installments over a number of years.Benefits of the P-8A PoseidonBoeing's P-8A is an aircraft designed for long-range anti-submarine warfare, anti-surface warfare, and maritime surveillance and reconnaissance missions. The aircraft is capable of broad-area maritime and littoral operations as well. It is also effective at search and rescue missions. P-8 is a derivative of the Next-Generation 737-800, which combines Superior performance and reliability with an advanced mission system that ensures maximum interoperability in the future battle space.Our ViewAs Boeing’s key forte lies in manufacturing combat-proven aircraft, the company has inevitably secured large number of contracts from the Pentagon for long, courtesy of its proven expertise in aerospace programs. As a result, the company’s defense unit — Boeing Defense, Space & Security (BDS) segment — exhibits a solid revenue generation history. Evidently, the BDS unit reflected a 13% year over year top-line improvement in first-quarter 2018’s results.Boeing already enjoys commercial relationship with Air New Zealand, and with the latest P-8A aircraft delivery deal, it has set foot in the country's defense forces. Notably, the deal has been sealed at a time when New Zealand has expressed concerns about China authoritatively pursuing interests in Asian military airspace. On that note, if China does try to intervene further, possibilities of increased adoption of Boeing’s surveillance military jets will enhance.  On the domestic front, last month the U.S. Senate approved the fiscal 2019 defense budget that included a spending plan of $2.2 billion for the P-8A Poseidon, $600 million more than the previous year’s budget request. Such favorable budgetary developments reflect solid growth prospects for Boeing’s P-8A Poseidon in the United States going ahead, which, in turn, are likely to boost the company’s profit margin.Price MovementBoeing’s stock rallied about 65.8% in a year compared with the industry’s growth of 29.1%. The outperformance was primarily led by the robust worldwide demand for its commercial aircraft and military jets.Zacks Rank & Key PicksBoeing currently carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

913,NOC,"Per major media releases, The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) has recently entered into an agreement with the second largest Indian airline, Jet Airways, for delivering 75 of its 737 MAX narrow body jet aircraft. The agreement is in line with Jet Airways’ latest rush to expand their carriers to meet the expanding domestic passenger demand in the country.The deal, valued more than $9 billion at current list prices, led to the third consecutive agreement between Boeing and Jet Airways over the last ten months, taking the total purchased tally to 225 aircraft. However, it’s yet to be revealed whether the agreement was a formal order or a non-binding memorandum of understanding.Boeing’s Prospects in IndiaDue to the rising level of airborne passenger and cargo traffic, major airlines from all over the world, including India-based airlines are increasing their fleet size to meet rigorous customer demands. According to the International Air Transport Association, the domestic Indian passenger traffic witnessed a 27.9% rise in March 2018 from the previous year. Naturally, this must have prompted Indian airlines, in particular, to aggressively expand their fleet size and the latest deal between Boeing and Jet Airways is a glowing example of that.In fact, lately, Boeing has inked a number of significant deals with its Indian customers to support the growing aviation market in the nation. In this line, Boeing has recently entered into a $3.3 billion agreement, at list prices, with Vistara for delivering six of its 787 dreamliners to the company. SpiceJet also placed a firm order for 40 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft in June, a deal valued at a list price of $4.74 billion, the first of which is likely to be delivered later this year. Such impressive orders for its commercial airplanes in India will pave a solid foundation for the company to capture a sizeable market share in the country.In light of these developments, it is imperative to mention that India has emerged as another promising market for Boeing, with the Asia’s third largest economy, which is expected to become the world’s fastest growing aviation market. According to the company, the country will need 2,100 new planes worth $290 billion in the next 20 years, up 13.5% from the year-ago estimate of 1,850 planes. Therefore, we may expect to witness more such deals in coming days between Indian airlines and Boeing, which is the largest jet maker in the world.Price MovementBoeing’s stock rallied about 66.6% in a year compared with the industry’s growth of 29.5%. The outperformance was primarily led by the robust worldwide demand for its commercial aircraft and military jets.Zacks Rank & Key PicksBoeing currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

914,NOC,"Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) Aeronautics business division recently won a $175.3-million modification contract to support the F-35 Lightning depot implementation plan for the U.S. Air Force, Marine Corps, Navy and non-Department of Defense (DoD) participants. The contract was awarded by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD.Details of the DealPer the terms, Lockheed Martin will provide development, testing and activation services for thirteen different F-35 component repair capabilities in support of the implementation plan. The modification includes 46.9% of the work for the U.S. Air Force, 23.5% for the U.S. Navy, 23.5% for the U.S. Marine Corps and 6.1% for the non-DoD participants.Work related to the deal will be performed in Nashua, NH; Torrance, CA; Fort Worth, TX and other various locations across the United States. The tasks are expected to get completed by November 2021. Lockheed Martin will utilize fiscal 2018 aircraft procurement (Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps) and non-DoD funds for completing the task.Benefits of F-35 Joint Strike Fighter ProgramThe F-35 Lightning is a supersonic, multi-role fighter jet, which represents a quantum leap in air-dominance capability, offering enhanced lethality and survivability in hostile, anti-access airspace environments. Its advanced stealth allows pilots to penetrate into areas without being detected by enemy radars. It is being used by the defense forces of the United States and 11 other nations, worldwide, largely due to its advanced stealth, integrated avionics, sensor fusion, superior logistics support and powerful integrated sensors capabilities.What’s Favoring Lockheed Martin?The F-35 program is Lockheed Martin’s largest program, which generated 24% of its total consolidated net sales in first-quarter 2018. Moreover, higher sales at Aeronautics, primarily attributable to higher sales registered for the F-35 program and increased volume on F-35 sustainment activities during the same time frame, enabled its Aeronautics segment’s revenue to grow 7% year over year to $4.4 billion. As of May 14, 2018, the company successfully delivered more than 290 F-35 jets to the United States and its allies.Lockheed Martin, being one of the Pentagon’s prime contractors, enjoys a steady flow of contracts each year and the second quarter of 2018 has not been any exception either. In June itself, the company secured a deal worth $736 million to support the F-35 Lightning II program and a contract worth $503 million for providing air vehicle initial spare parts in support of the F-35 program. Considering the frequent order inflows, we expect its Aeronautics unit to reflect similar solid performance in the coming quarterly results as well.Moreover, production of F-35 is expected to rise in the years ahead, given the U.S. government’s current inventory objective of 2,456 aircraft for the Air Force, Marine Corps and Navy along with commitments from the company’s eight international partners, overseas customers and rising demand on a global scale.Furthermore, the recently approved fiscal 2019 defense budget provisions for a spending plan of $21.7 billion on Aircraft. The budget proposal hints at a prospective increase in Lockheed Martin’s F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program that has been allotted $10.7 billion along with additional funding for the procurement of 97 F-35 Joint Strike Fighters. Evidently, these developments reflect solid growth prospects for Lockheed Martin’s F-35 program going ahead, which, in turn, are likely to boost the company’s profit margin.Price Movement    Lockheed Martin’s stock has improved about 7.7% in the last year compared with the industry’s growth of 29.5%. The underperformance may have been caused by the intense competition that the company faces in the aerospace-defense space for its broad portfolio of products and services, both domestically as well as internationally.Zacks Rank & Key PicksLockheed Martin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Per the terms of the deal, Lockheed Martin will procure support equipment, labor, and Autonomic Logistics Information System hardware required to stand up the F-35 OCONUS MRO&U capability. Notably, the latest order includes 83.7% of the work for non-Department of Defense (DoD) participants, 8.1% for the U.S. Air Force, 4.1% for the U.S. Marine Corps and 4.1% for the U.S. Navy. Majority of the work will be executed in New South Wales, Australia and Cameri, Italy.Lockheed Martinwill utilize fiscal 2018 aircraft procurement (Air Force, Marine Corps and Navy); and non-DoD participant funds to finance the task.F-35 Lightning II AttributesLockheed Martin’s F-35 Lightning II is a single-seat, single-engine 5th Generation fighter aircraft, which comes with an advanced stealth feature combined with enhanced fighter speed and agility, fully fused advanced sensor information, weapons capacity and range, network-enabled operations and advanced sustainment.The F-35’s ability to collect, analyze and share data is a powerful force multiplier enhancing all airborne, surface and ground-based assets in the battle space and enabling military personnel to effectively execute combat  missions. In fact, three variants of F-35 are set to replace five fighter jets for the U.S. Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps as well as a variety of fighter jets for at least 10 other countries.Recent DevelopmentsThe F-35 program, being Lockheed Martin’s leading project, generated 24% of the company’s net sales in the first quarter of 2018. Moreover, higher sales from the F-35 program led to the Aeronautics segment’s revenue growth of 7% year over year to $4.4 billion.Lockheed Martin, the Pentagon’s largest contractor, enjoys a steady flow of contracts each year and the second quarter of 2018 has not been any exception either. Recently, the company secured a contract worth $736 million to support the low-rate initial production of F-35 Lightning II aircraft of the 13th and 14th lot. Also, it won a$503.2 million modification contract for providing air vehicle initial spare parts in support of the F-35 program. Considering such order inflows along with the latest one, we expect the company’s Aeronautics unit to reflect similar solid performance in the coming quarterly results as well.Moreover, production of F-35 is expected to rise in the years ahead, given the U.S. government’s current inventory objective of 2,456 aircraft for the Air Force, Marine Corps and Navy along with commitments from the company’s eight international partners and rising international demands.Also, President Trump recently proposed fiscal 2019 defense budget that provisions for a spending plan of $21.7 billion on Aircraft.

916,NOC,"The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) recently signed an agreement with the Vietnamese startup airline, Bamboo Airways, for delivering 20 787-9 Dreamliner aircraft to the latter. The deal, on finalization, is estimated to be worth around $5.6 billion, at current list prices.Per the terms, Bamboo Airways already completed the deposit requirement this month for reserving 20 airplanes, which are tentatively scheduled for delivery, from April 2020 through 2021.    Boeing’s Prospects in the Southeast Asian MarketIn 2017, Boeing identified Southeast Asia as one of the fastest growing markets worldwide for new airplanes. In this context, the company forecasts that the region will need 4,210 new airplanes, valued approximately at $645 billion, in next 20 years. The company also estimates annual air traffic growth of 6.2% over the next 20 years in this region, outpacing the world’s average growth rate by 1.5%.Naturally, to capitalize on the growing opportunities in Southeast Asia, Boeing aims at inking deals for its commercial jet fleet. The latest deal is a glowing example of that.   What’s Ahead for Boeing?Per Boeing’s current market outlook, the world would require 41,030 new planes between 2017 and 2036, worth $6.1 trillion.The company expects widebody jets to be a strong driver, comprising 20% of the total projection. This translates into worldwide demand for 8,210 widebody jets, worth $2.9 trillion, over the next 20 years. As the company continues to witness frequent contract wins for its commercial airplanes, such demand growth should continue to fuel its overall revenue expansion.Moreover, in the first quarter of 2018, the company’s Commercial Airplane Segment, which includes the 787 dreamliner jets, saw an 8% rise in revenues to $13.65 billion. Further, it delivered 184 commercial planes during the quarter, which was up 9% year over year, alongside securing orders for 24 787 dreamliners. Looking ahead, Boeing remains focused on improving cash generation and profitability, driven by favorable delivery mix, supplier step down pricing, and efforts to drive internal productivity and supply-chain management.Such efforts should bolster Boeing’s position in the commercial aerospace market, as prospects for twin-aisle jet planes seem impressive, with more airlines shifting to small and medium-sized wide-body airplanes like Boeing’s 787 fleet. The company’s latest commitment to Bamboo Airways is one such example. Thus, we may expect Boeing to reflect similar strong results and acquire more commercial contracts in days ahead, which, in turn, are likely to boost the company’s profit margin.Price MovementBoeing’s stock rallied about 65.6% in a year compared with the industry’s growth of 28.9%. The outperformance was primarily led by the robust worldwide demand for its commercial aircraft and military jets.Zacks Rank & Key PicksBoeing currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

917,NOC,"General Dynamics Corp.’s (GD  -  Free Report) subsidiary, Ordnance and Tactical Systems, Inc., recently secured a $149.2 million modification deal for Hydra rockets, motors and associated components. The contract was awarded by the U.S. Army Contracting Command, Redstone Arsenal, AL, under the foreign military sales (FMS) program.Details of the DealPer the terms of the deal, General Dynamics will deliver various quantities of M151, M274, M257, M278, M156, M264, M278, and WTU-1/B warheads for Hydra-70 rockets, motors and associated components to Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, Kenya, Jordan, Nigeria and Qatar.Work related to the deal will be performed in Williston, VT and Hampton, AZ, and is expected to get completed by Feb 28, 2021. General Dynamics will utilize fiscal 2016, 2017 and 2018 other procurement (Army) funds for completing the task.Advantages of the Hydra-70 RocketsGeneral Dynamics' Hydra-70 rockets include unitary and cargo warheads for use against point and area targets, providing the user a lethal and lightweight weapon system with multi-mission capability. The Hydra-70 rockets are universally compatible with the Advanced Precision Kill System (APKWS).Fitted to the MK66 MOD 4 motor, these warheads provide low-cost munitions capable of area suppression and defeating threats at extended ranges, as well as providing battlefield obscuration, illumination and marking.These rockets provide military personnel with affordable firepower, matched to the mission for effective engagements and area suppression of a long list of lower-value targets on the battlefield. These advanced rockets can also be mounted on most of the rotary and fixed-wing aircraft, which include the Apache, Cobra and F-16.What’s Favoring General Dynamics?As widespread geo-political tensions loom across the globe, many nations are strengthening their arsenals and taking significant initiatives to upgrade rocket systems. This, in turn, should boost General Dynamics’ overall growth in the rocket and missile market.Notably, General Dynamics' Combat Systems segment that manufactures and supplies Hydra-70 rockets, registered $1.44 billion of sales in the first quarter of 2018, reflecting 11.9% year-over-year growth. We may expect General Dynamics to witness similar strong results in this segment in upcoming quarters as well, buoyed by strong demand for its combat-proven rocket systems, eventually leading to contract wins like the latest one. This, in turn, should expand the company’s profit margin.Moreover, the fiscal 2019 defense budget, recently approved by the U.S. Senate, provisions for a spending plan of $1.2 billion on the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System. Such robust budgetary allotments should aid General Dynamics in acquiring major contracts from the Pentagon, related to its various rocket systems.Furthermore, the rocket and missile market is projected to grow from $55.5 billion in 2017 to $70 billion by 2022, at a CAGR of 4.74%, during the forecast period (as per Markets and Markets research firm). This, in turn, should enable General Dynamics to enhance its market share in the aerospace and defense industry.Price Movement    General Dynamics’s stock has lost 5.4% in the last year compared with its industry’s growth of 30.4%. The underperformance may have been caused by the intense competition that the company faces in the aerospace-defense space.Zacks Rank & Key Picks    General Dynamics currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A few better-ranked stocks in the same space are Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report), Textron (TXT  -  Free Report) and Wesco Aircraft Holdings (WAIR  -  Free Report).While Northrop Grumman sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Textron and Wesco Aircraft Holdings carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

918,NOC,"Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc.'s (HII  -  Free Report) Ingalls Shipbuilding business unit recently secured a modification contract for carrying out emergent repair and restoration of USS Fitzgerald (DDG 62).  The contract was awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, DC.The deal, valued at $27.5 million, also entails for the additional collision repairs along with the maintenance and modernization of the USS Fitzgerald. Work related to the deal will be executed in Pascagoula, MS and is scheduled to get completed by January 2020. Huntington Ingalls will utilize fiscal 2018 operations and maintenance (Navy) funds and fiscal 2017 other procurement (Navy) funds to complete the task.A Brief Note on USS FitzgeraldThe USS Fitzgerald (DDG 62) is a guided missile destroyer battleship belonging to the Arleigh Burke class of surface ships, currently serving the U.S. Navy. While DD represents the basic destroyers per US Navy classifications, G stands for its guided missile armament design. It is built around the Aegis Combat System and the SPY-1D multifunction passive electronically scanned array radar.What’s Favoring Huntington Ingalls?Huntington Ingalls is one of the largest military shipbuilders in the country. More than 70% of the active Navy fleet comprises ships from this company. The company’s Ingalls Shipbuilding unit is the largest supplier of U.S. Navy surface combatants and has built nearly 70% of the U.S. Navy fleet of warships, till date.Notably, Huntington Ingalls’ revenues were $1.7 billion in the first quarter of 2018, which increased 8.7% year over year. This upside was primarily driven by higher volumes in amphibious ships at the Ingalls business division along with higher volumes in aircraft carriers and navy nuclear support services at Newport shipbuilding. We expect the company’s Ingalls division to efficiently improve the construction and modernization of shipbuilding programs in the upcoming quarters and significantly contribute to its revenue growth, thereby.Furthermore, the U.S. Senate approved the fiscal 2019 U.S. defense budget last month, which provisions for a spending of $18.3 billion on shipbuilding and increasing the end strength for the U.S. Navy. These developments reflect massive growth prospects for shipbuilding giants like Huntington Ingalls, increasing its chances of acquiring major shipbuilding contracts. This, in turn, will boost the company’sprofit margin.Price PerformanceShares of Huntington Ingalls rallied about 12.4% in a year compared with the industry’s 28.1% growth. The underperformance might have been caused due to intense competition that the company faces in the aerospace-defense space.Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to ConsiderHuntington Ingalls carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

919,NOC,"Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) business segment, Aeronautics, recently clinched a foreign military sales (FMS) contract for manufacturing 16 F-16 V Block 70 aircraft. Work related to the deal is scheduled to be completed by Sep 30, 2020.Details of the DealValued at $1.1 billion, the contract was awarded by the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. Per the terms of the agreement, the F-16 jets will be delivered to the Kingdom of Bahrain.The production will be carried out in Greenville, SC; and Fort Worth, TX. Lockheed Martin will utilize FMS funds to complete the order.A Brief Note on F-16Originally manufactured by General Dynamics (GD  -  Free Report), F-16 became part of Lockheed Martin after it acquired the former’s aircraft manufacturing business. The combat-proven F-16 falcon is a multi-role fighter jet, which currently serves 28 nations. As an F-16 Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Lockheed Martin is uniquely qualified to design, engineer, develop, integrate and sustain a complete F-16 weapons system to meet customer requirements.Over the decades, the F-16 falcon has evolved from a day-only lightweight jet to all-weather multi-role fighter. The F-16V Block 70 is the newest and most advanced generation of the F-16 fleet. Its superiority over the earlier F-16 models lies in its advanced APG-83 AESA radar.Notably, Northrop Grumman’s (NOC  -  Free Report) APG-83 radar provides F-16s with 5th generation fighter radar capabilities, which allow better detection and tracking ranges, multiple target track as well as high-resolution Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) maps for all-environment precision strike.Foreign Military Sales: A Key Catalyst Apart from enjoying a strong foothold in domestic markets, Lockheed Martin’s combat-proven jets are also well acclaimed internationally. In March 2017, the U.S. administration declared that it will go forward with the sale of 19 Lockheed Martin F-16 jets to Bahrain worth $5 billion. Earlier, the deal was stalled by the Obama Administration owing to the human rights concerns. This go-ahead gave a huge boost to the F-16 product line’s growth.Meanwhile, realizing the expanding defense market in the Middle East and Asia-Pacific regions lately, Lockheed Martin inked a landmark deal with Tata Advanced Systems Limited (TASL) in June 2017. Per the contract, both the companies will jointly manufacture Lockheed Martin’s F-16 Block 70 fighter jets in India. We believe this deal to be an important strategic move by the defense prime to substantially expand its foothold in the market of India — the world’s largest military weapons importer. Thus, reflecting the increased demand for Lockheed Martin’s F-16 model overseas.Moreover, the United States considers Bahrain as its important partner in this region, given the prevailing socio-political tensions in the Middle East. This is quite evident from the last year’s deal. Moreover, in May 2018, the U.S. State Department approved Bahrain’s purchase of 3,200 bomb bodies to arm its fleet of F-16 fighters. This, in turn, is expected to bolster the Royal Bahraini Air Force’s ability to conduct and sustain air operations with its F-16 combat aircraft, which is expected to get yet another boost with the latest contract win.For Lockheed Martin, aircraft deal wins like the latest one, should substantially drive its Aeronautics division’s sales. In the first quarter of 2018, this segment witnessed a 7% year-over-year improvement in sales and can be expected to exhibit similar performance moving ahead, based on aforementioned developments.Price Movement    In a year’s time, Lockheed Martin has gained about 6.9% compared with the industry’s rally of 30.4%. The underperformance may have been caused by the intense competition that the company faces in the aerospace-defense space for its broad portfolio of products and services, both domestically and internationally. Zacks Rank & Key Pick    Lockheed Martin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A better-ranked stock in the same space is Boeing (BA  -  Free Report), which has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Boeing came up with an average positive earnings surprise of 29.51% in the trailing four quarters. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings moved up 4.4% to $14.67 over the last 90 days.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

921,NOC,"Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) Gyrocam Systems business unit recently clinched a contract involving the production and delivery of spare parts for the AN/VSQ-6B Vehicle Optics Sensor system (VOSS). Work related to the deal is scheduled to be over by Jul 3, 2023.Valued at $80 million, the contract was awarded by the Defense Logistics Agency Land and Maritime, Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland. Lockheed Martin will utilize fiscal 2018 through 2023 Army working capital funds and other procurement (Army) funds to complete the task, at Florida.Gyrocam Systems & VOSSLockheed Martin’s Gyrocam Systems offer gyro-stabilized electro-optical sensors and night vision enhancements that allow users to see through fog, haze and complete darkness. These sensors are cost-effective and can be easily tailored with interchangeable universal mounts for ground vehicles, airborne platforms, maritime vessels and perimeter security application. To date, more than 1,100 Gyrocam sensor systems have been installed in all branches of the U.S. military, law enforcement and NATO and coalition partners.The VOSS is a remotely-controlled, gyro-stabilized, telescoping, high-resolution, zoom capable multi-sensor (daylight camera, night vision camera, thermal imaging camera) surveillance system that uses existing commercial camera technology. This system has been use in Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and Major Army Commands on various variants of the Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) Vehicle fleet.What’s Favoring Lockheed Martin?Lockheed Martin, being one of the Pentagon’s prime contractors, enjoys a steady flow of contracts each year and 2018 has not been any exception either. Recently, the company secured a contract worth $288 million for providing sensor systems along with other technical services for the Apache helicopter. Last week, it won a $175 million deal to support the F-35 Lightning depot implementation plan. Considering such frequent order inflows along with the latest one, we expect the company to reflect solid performance in the coming quarterly results, keeping its usual trend.Moreover, Lockheed Martin ended 2017 with backlog worth $99.9 billion, up 3.8% from the year-ago number. This upside reflects increased demand from domestic and international customers. Additionally, its leveraged presence in the Army, Air Force, Navy and IT programs guarantees a steady flow of follow-on orders not only from the U.S. government but also from a large number of foreign allies of the nation.The recently approved fiscal 2019 defense budget, which provisions for a spending of $716 billion in the United States’ defense, is also an added positive. These developments reflect solid growth prospects for Lockheed Martin’s combat-proven program like the Gyrocam Systems, which in turn, should boost its profit margin.Price Movement    In a year’s time, Lockheed Martin’s stock has gained about 6% compared with the industry’s 28% rally. The underperformance may have been caused by the intense competition that the company faces in the aerospace-defense space for its broad portfolio of products and services domestically as well as internationally.Zacks Rank & Key PicksLockheed Martin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

922,NOC,"Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) Missiles and Fire Control business unit recently won a $288.3 million modification contract for providing sensor systems along with other technical services for the Apache helicopter, to United Arab Emirates. The contract was awarded by the U.S. Army Contracting Command, Rock Island Arsenal, IL.Details of the DealPer the terms of the deal, Lockheed Martin will provide the Modernized Target Acquisition Designation Sight/Pilot Night Vision Sensor (M-TADS/PNVS), subcomponents and technical services for the Apache attack helicopter. The contract was secured under the domestic and foreign military sales program.Work related to the deal will be performed in Orlando, FL and is expected to be completed by Dec 31, 2021. Lockheed Martin will utilize fiscal 2018 foreign military sales and aircraft procurement (Army) funds for completing the task.A Brief Note on the M-TADS/PNVS SystemsThe Modernized Target Acquisition Designation Sight/Pilot Night Vision Sensor (M-TADS/PNVS), also known as Arrowhead, is a long-range, precision engagement and pilotage solution for missions operated during the day, night and in adverse weather conditions. Lockheed Martin’s electro-optical sensor provides enhanced situational awareness to Apache’s aircrew, with greater performance and survivability.Advantages of the Apache Attack HelicopterThe AH-64 Apache Helicopter is the world’s most advanced multi-role combat helicopter,  which has been developed by Boeing (BA  -  Free Report), and is used by the U.S. Army and a growing number of international defense forces.  AH-64E is the latest version of the AH-64 gunship and is equipped with new improved sensors, avionics and night operation capabilities. Further, it possesses an infra-red suppressing exhaust system as well as chaff and flare dispensers, which jointly reduce the chance of being located and hit by enemy air-defense missiles.What’s Favoring Lockheed Martin?Steady and regular order inflows for Lockheed Martin’s MFC unit tend to fuel the company’s top-line growth. Notably, the company’s MFC segment recorded first-quarter 2018 net sales of $1.7 billion, reflecting a healthy 8% improvement from the year-ago quarter. In line with this, we may expect the latest contract to boost MFC’s revenue growth in the days to come.Furthermore, the recently approved fiscal 2019 defense budget provisions for a spending plan of $21.7 billion on aircraft. In particular, the budget includes a prospective increase in investment for the AH-64E Apache Attack Helicopter, which has been allotted $1.3 billion.

923,NOC,"General Dynamics Corporation’s (GD  -  Free Report) business unit, Land Systems, recently secured a $258.6 million modification contract to upgrade Stryker flat-bottom vehicles to the patented double V-hull design. The contract was awarded by the U.S. Army Contracting Command, Warren, MI.Work related to the deal will be performed in Sterling Heights, MI, and is expected to get completed in Mar 31, 2020. General Dynamics will utilize fiscal 2018 procurement of weapons and tracked combat vehicles’ funds for completing the task.A Brief Note on Stryker Land VehicleThe eight-wheeled, armored combat vehicle is powered by a 350 horsepower Caterpillar JP-8 diesel engine that provides the U.S. Army with an effective mix of capabilities, including infantry transport offensive firepower and reconnaissance. The Stryker's other capabilities include the anti-tank guided missiles, mobile C4ISR, engineering and fire support, mobile gun system, and medical evacuation.The vehicle is employed in Stryker Brigade Combat Teams, light and mobile units based on the brigade combat team doctrine that relies on vehicles connected by military C4I (Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence) networks.The vehicle was outfitted with a new double-V hull, to survive in IED-prone zones of Afghanistan. Such improvements in the design led to staggering improvements in soldier survivability, providing protection in open terrain areas.What’s Favoring General Dynamics?With widespread geo-political tension around the globe, many nations are strengthening their arsenals and taking initiatives to upgrade land-combat military vehicles. This in turn should boost General Dynamics’ growth, with the company being one of the major players in the wheeled military vehicle market.Notably, General Dynamics' Combat Systems segment that manufactures wheeled combat vehicles registered $1.44 billion of sales in the first quarter of 2018, reflecting 11.9% year-over-year growth.

924,NOC,"Take a company’s revenues over a given period of time, subtract the cost of production and you will have its earnings! Earnings growth enthralls almost everyone, right from the top brass to research analysts. And why not? If the company doesn’t make money, it won’t last over the long haul.This metric is also considered a key variable in influencing the share price. Better-than-expected earnings performances normally lead to a rally in the share price. However, in addition to actual earnings, expectations of earnings play a significant role in influencing the price of a stock.Earnings Estimates Determine Share PriceWe have often seen a decline in stock price despite earnings growth and a rally in price following an earnings decline. This is largely a result of a company’s earnings failing to meet market expectations.Earnings estimates embody analysts’ opinions of factors such as sales growth, product demand, competitive industry environment, profit margins and cost control. Thus, earnings estimates serve as a valuable tool while making investment decisions. Earnings estimates also help analysts assess the cash flow to determine the fair value of a firm.Investors, thus, should be on the lookout for stocks that are ready to make a big move. Hence, it is important for investors to buy stocks that have historical earnings growth and are also seeing a rise in quarterly and annual earnings estimates.The Winning StrategyIn order to shortlist stocks that have striking earnings growth and positive estimate revisions, we have added the following parameters:Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2 (Only Zacks' 'Buys' and 'Strong Buys' are allowed. With the Zacks Rank proving itself to be one of the best rating systems out there, this is a great way to start things off.)5-Year Historical EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry (Stocks that possess strong EPS growth history.)% Change EPS F(0)/F(-1) greater than or equal to 5 (Companies that witnessed year-over-year earnings growth rate of 5% or more in the last reported fiscal.)% Change Q1 Estimates over the last 4 weeks greater than zero (Stocks that have seen their current quarter earnings estimates revised higher in the last 4 weeks.)% Change F1 Estimates over the last 1 week greater than zero (Stocks that have seen their annual earnings estimates revised higher in the last 1 week.)% Change F1 Estimates over the last 4 weeks greater than zero (Stocks that have seen their annual earnings estimates revised higher in the last 4 weeks.)The above criteria narrowed down the universe of around 7,818 stocks to only 11.Here are the top four stocks:Celanese Corporation (CE  -  Free Report) manufactures and sells value-added chemicals, thermoplastic polymers, and other chemical-based products worldwide. The company carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Its estimated growth rate for this year is 25.9%, higher than the Chemical - Diversified  industry’s rise of 19.2%.Steel Dynamics, Inc. (STLD  -  Free Report) engages in the steel products manufacturing and metals recycling businesses in the United States and internationally. The company has a Zacks Rank #2. Its estimated growth rate for this year is 89.1%, higher than the Steel - Producers industry’s increase of 12.8%.Adobe Systems Incorporated (ADBE  -  Free Report) operates as a diversified software company worldwide.

925,NOC,"General Dynamics Corp.’s (GD  -  Free Report) business division, Electric Boat, recently secured a modification contract for economic ordering quantity material associated with the fiscal 2019-2023 Virginia class submarines. Work related to the deal is scheduled to be completed by January 2019.Details of the DealValued at $225 million, the contract was awarded by Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C. Electric Boat will utilize fiscal 2018 shipbuilding and conversion (Navy) funds to finance the task.Work for the modification will be carried out in Spring Grove, IL; Bethlehem, PA; and several different locations across the United States.A Brief Note on Virginia-Class SubmarineThe Virginia-class submarine program is a class of nuclear-powered fast-attack submarines (SSNs) serving the U.S. Navy. These submarines are designed for a broad spectrum of open-ocean and littoral missions, jointly constructed by General Dynamics and Huntington Ingalls Industries.Intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance operations as well as mine warfare are also carried out by these fast-attack submarines. Notably, these vessels are one of the three classes of attack submarines used by the U.S. Navy. The other two are the Los Angeles class and the Seawolf class. Valued around $2.7 billion each, these three submarines will be operational until 2070.What’s Favoring General Dynamics?General Dynamics enjoys a dominant position as a Navy contractor. This is because it is one of the only two contractors in the world that are equipped to build nuclear-powered submarines.In December 2015, the Navy updated its force-level goal from its prior target to achieve and maintain a 308-ship fleet, which included 48 SSNs to 355-ship fleet, comprising 66 SSNs. Thereby, reflecting the immense priority that the U.S. Navy bestows upon this class of nuclear submarines.However, the number of SSNs is expected to decline by more than 20% over the next decade due to a smaller number of procurements done in the 90’s. This means, to reach the force-level goal, the U.S. Navy should accelerate their procurement rate in the coming days. For the Virginia-Class submarines, an increased number of procurement contracts can be expected from the Pentagon, which in turn should boost General Dynamics’ profit margin effectively.Furthermore, the U.S. Navy has acknowledged the Virginia-class program as its top priority and allotted an upmarket budget for the same. This also bodes well for General Dynamics as it is the prime contractor for this program.Price Movement    In a year’s time, shares of General Dynamics have lost 4.2% against the industry’s rally of 34%. The underperformance may have been caused by the intense competition that General Dynamics faces in the aerospace-defense space. Zacks Rank & Key Picks                                   General Dynamics currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A few better-ranked stocks in the same industry are Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report), Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) and Textron (TXT  -  Free Report). While Northrop Grumman sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Boeing and Textron carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

926,NOC,"Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) Aeronautics division recently won a $503.2 million modification contract for providing air vehicle initial spare parts in support of the F-35 program. The contract was awarded by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD.Details of the DealPer the deal, Lockheed Martin will provide initial spares that include F-35 Lightning II deployment spares packages, afloat spares packages and associated consumables. The spare parts would be used for supporting air vehicle delivery schedules for the U.S. Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps and non-Department of Defense (DoD) participants.The modification includes 21% of the work for the U.S. Air Force, 14% for the U.S. Navy, 18% for the U.S. Marine Corps and 47% for the non-DoD participants.Work related to the deal will be performed in Fort Worth, TX; Samlesbury and Cheltenham, the United Kingdom; Papendrect, The Netherlands and various other locations across the United States. The tasksare expected to get completed in December 2023. Lockheed Martin will utilize fiscal 2018 aircraft procurement (Air Force, Marine Corps and Navy) and non-DoD participant funds for completing the task.Benefits of F-35 Lightning II JetThe F-35 Lightning is a supersonic, multi-role fighter jet, which represents a quantum leap in air-dominance capability offering enhanced lethality and survivability in hostile, anti-access airspace environments. Its advanced stealth allows pilots to penetrate into areas without being detected by enemy radars.The F-35 jet is being used by the defense forces of the United States and 11 other nations, worldwide, largely due to its advanced stealth, integrated avionics, sensor fusion, superior logistics support and powerful integrated sensors capabilities. Looking ahead, the program’s domain is expected to witness a robust expansion across the globe.What’s Favoring Lockheed Martin?The F-35 program is Lockheed Martin’s largest program, which generated 24% of its total net sales in first-quarter 2018. Moreover, higher sales from the F-35 program, during the same time frame, enabled its Aeronautics segment’s revenue to grow 7% year over year to $4.4 billion. As of May 14, 2018, the company successfully delivered more than 290 F-35 jets to the United States and its allies.Lockheed Martin, being one of the Pentagon’s prime contractors, enjoys a steady flow of contracts each year and the second quarter of 2018 has not been any exception either. Recently, the company secured a contract worth $736 million to support the low-rate initial production of F-35 Lightning II aircraft of the 13th and 14th lot. Considering the frequent order inflows along with the latest one, we expect its Aeronautics unit to reflect similar solid performance in the coming quarterly results as well.Moreover, production of F-35 is expected to rise in the years ahead, given the U.S. government’s current inventory objective of 2,456 aircraft for the Air Force, Marine Corps and Navy along with commitments from the company’s eight international partners and rising international demands. Such projected estimations will certainly lead to an increase in the production of air vehicle spares and associated consumables for this aircraft.Furthermore, the fiscal 2019 defense budget proposal, announced by Trump this February, provisions for a spending plan of $21.7 billion on aircraft. The budget proposal hints at a prospective increase in Lockheed Martin’s F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program that has been allotted $10.7 billion along with additional funding for the procurement of 97 F-35 Joint Strike Fighters. Evidently, these developments reflect solid growth prospects for Lockheed Martin’s F-35 program, going ahead, which in turn are likely to boost the company’s profit margin.Price Movement    Lockheed Martin’s stock has improved about 9.9% in the last one year compared with the industry’s growth of 34.6%. The underperformance may have been caused by the intense competition that the company faces in the aerospace-defense space for its broad portfolio of products and services, both domestically as well as internationally.Zacks Rank & Key Picks    Lockheed Martin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Buy). A few better-ranked stocks in the same space are Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report), Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) and Wesco Aircraft Holdings (WAIR  -  Free Report).While Northrop Grumman sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Boeing and Wesco Aircraft carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

927,NOC,"Textron Inc.’s (TXT  -  Free Report) Aviation Defense business unit recently secured a $36.2 million modification contract related to T-6C aircraft. The deal is scheduled to be completed by Nov 30, 2018.Details of the DealAwarded by the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Wright Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, this foreign military sales (FMS) deal will support the Argentina Air Force.Per the terms of the agreement, the company will provide maintenance and pilot training as well as interim contractor support for maintenance of four T-6C jets. Also, Textron will offer supplies and services for the replacement of current training aircraft fleet and the enhancement of the Argentina Air Force surveillance and border security mission.Work under the agreement will be executed in Wichita, KS. The modification should increase the deal’s not-to-exceed price to $125 million.A Brief Note on T-6C AircraftTextron’s Beechcraft T-6C Texan II military training aircraft is a next generation military trainer, which prepares pilots for real world missions. Each training capability is designed for military aircraft mission experience, providing pilots with the expertise and confidence to achieve success.The latest T-6C Texan II flight deck features include primary flight display, navigation, engine-indicating and crew-alerting systems as well as programmable mission functions. It also comprises a back-up, all-in-one flight instrument that combines all essential flight cues in one easy-to-read display.Our ViewTextron is globally recognized for popular and valuable brand names, such as Bell Helicopter, Cessna Aircraft, Jacobsen, Kautex, E-Z-GO and Greenlee. Geographically, its diverse network of businesses negates any specific business risk. Meanwhile, the company’s systematic inorganic growth strategy along with its focus on strengthening international presence is expected to boost its results.In particular, the company’s Aviation segment has been witnessing solid top-line growth buoyed by strong demand for its business jets as well as combat-proven military aircraft. Evidently, the segment witnessed 4.1% revenue growth in the first quarter of 2018, courtesy of high volumes for its jets. Considering the latest contract, we may expect this segment to exhibit similar performance in the upcoming quarters as well.Moreover, President Trump proposed fiscal 2019 defense budget in February 2018 that provisioned major war-fighting investments of $21.7 billion for aircraft. Such proposed inclusions reflect solid growth prospects for Textron’s Aviation segment, which in turn are likely to boost the company’s profit margin, going ahead.Price MovementIn a year’s time, Textron has rallied about 40.1% compared with the industry’s 34.5% upside. The outperformance was most probably led by the company’s strong order growth history along with solid delivery figures. Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to Consider    Textron currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

928,NOC,"Raytheon Company’s (RTN  -  Free Report) Missile Systems (MS) business unit recently won a $315 million deal for the production of the Griffin Missiles. The contract was awarded by the U.S. Special Operations Command Contracting Office, Tampa, FL.Details of the DealPer the terms of the deal, Raytheon will also provide related assistance for product improvement, operations and sustainment for the Griffin Missiles. Work related to the deal will be performed at the contractor facilities in Tucson, AZ.The company will utilize fiscal 2018 research, development, and testing and evaluation funds for completing the tasks. Raytheon may also secure additional funding on a delivery/task-order basis.Advantages of the Griffin MissilesRaytheon’s Griffin Missile System is a combat-proven missile, which has been serving the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy force since its inception in 2008. It is a multi-platform and a multi-service weapon that has a proven track record of successful rapid integration on land, sea and air platforms.The missile system can engage both static and fast-moving targets, and offers reliable operational effectiveness to fighters against a variety of threats in counter-insurgency and irregular warfare operations. It also provides lethal effects, and employs GPS-aided inertial guidance and a semi-active laser seeker for pinpoint accuracy.What’s Favoring Raytheon?Increasing geo-political tensions across the globe have prompted nations to strengthen their defense systems manifold. With rapid technological upgrade, missile defense has steadily emerged to play a pivotal role in a nation’s defense strategy.To this end, Raytheon’s advanced MS segment has been clinching significant awards from the United States as well as international customers, courtesy of its high-end, combat-proven arsenals. The latest contract win is an evidence to that.Notably, the MS division recorded first-quarter 2018 net sales of $1,848 million, reflecting a 5% improvement from the year-ago quarter. We may expect the aforementioned contract to instill further growth in this segment, going ahead.Furthermore, the recently approved fiscal 2019 defense budget includes a spending plan of $12.9 billion on missile defense for Raytheon. Such favorable budgetary developments reflect solid growth prospects for Raytheon’s Griffin missiles and other missile programs going ahead, which, in turn, are likely to boost the company’s profit margin.Moreover, the rocket and missile market is projected to grow from $55.5 billion in 2017 to $70 billion by 2022, at a CAGR of 4.74% during the forecast period (as per Markets and Markets research firm). Given this huge opportunity for expansion, frequent contract wins from Pentagon for its high-end missile programs, including the latest one, will allow Raytheon to further enhance its market share in the aerospace and defense industry.Price MovementRaytheon’s stock has gained 19.6% in the last 12 months, compared with the industry’s growth of 23.1%. The underperformance may have been caused due to tough competition that the company faces in the defense market.  Zacks Rank & Key Picks    Raytheon currently holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

929,NOC,"The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) recently secured a deal worth $23.7 million for procuring F-15 vertical stabilizers. Work related to the deal is scheduled to be over by May 31, 2022.The contract was awarded by the Defense Logistics Agency Aviation, Richmond, VA. The company will utilize fiscal 2018 through 2022 defense working capital funds to complete the task at Missouri.A Brief Note on F-15Boeing’s F-15 Strike Eagle is a twin-engine, all-weather tactical fighter aircraft. Its proven design is unbeatable in air-to-air combat, with more than 100 aerial combat victories.Our ViewBoeing is one of the largest aerospace and defense contractors. Notably, its defense business stands out among peers on virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and backlog.Particularly, Boeing’s forte has been combat-proven aircraft among the other defense equipments. So far, the company has manufactured more than 1,600 F-15 aircraft for six countries and none of them plan to retire these jets, thus indicating this jet’s enhanced sustainability.In 2017, the company delivered 16 F-15s, up 7% from the year-ago tally. Moreover, its backlog increased 11% in the same period, primarily driven by contract wins for the F-15 program. Needless to say, this reflects the popularity that the F-15 jet enjoys in the United States.With rising security threats across the globe, developing economies like India, Qatar and a few more are ramping up their arsenal apart from developed nations like the United States. As a result, we may expect further expansion in F-15’s customer base, beyond its domestic realm, which in turn will boost Boeing’s profit from its defense business.Moreover, the $716-billion fiscal 2019 defense budget, which the U.S. Senate approved recently, is expected to boost the business of major U.S. defense contractors like Boeing.Price MovementIn a year’s time, Boeing’s shares have soared about 69.2%, outperforming the broader industry’s rally of 29.8%. This impressive performance was driven by the company’s record backlog supporting revenue growth, increased orders for commercial airplanes and expanded presence in domestic as well as international markets. Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to Consider    Boeing currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Some other top-ranked stocks in the same space include Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report), Textron (TXT  -  Free Report) and Wesco Aircraft Holdings (WAIR  -  Free Report).

930,NOC,"Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) Missile and Fire Control (MFC) business division recently won a $364.6 million contract for Army Tactical Guided Missile and Launching Assembly Service Life Extension program. The deal was awarded under the domestic and foreign military sales program.Details of the DealThe contract was awarded by the U.S. Army Contracting Command, Redstone Arsenal, AL. Per the terms, the company will deliver the missiles and extension programs to the Romanian Army.Work related to the deal will be performed in Dallas, TX; Boulder, CO; Clearwater, FL; Cincinnati, OH and various other locations across the United States. The tasks are expected to get completed in Mar 26, 2020. Lockheed Martin will utilize fiscal 2017 and 2018 research, development, test and evaluation; foreign military sales; overseas contingency operation and aircraft procurement (Army) funds for completing the task.A Brief Note on Army Tactical Missile SystemThe Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) is a conventional surface-to-surface artillery weapon system capable of striking targets well beyond the range of existing Army cannons, rockets and other missiles. The ATACMS long-range guided missiles are fired from the MLRS M270 and M270A1 weapons platform.What’s Favoring Lockheed Martin?Lockheed Martin’s MFC unit acquired several major orders in the second quarter of 2018. The segment was successful in clinching contracts worth $282 million for supporting PAC-3 missiles, $279 million for the delivery of PAC-3 missiles, and $200 million for upgrading THAAD and PATRIOT missiles.Inevitably, such massive order inflows for its missile programs tend to fuel the company’s top-line growth. Lockheed Martin’s MFC segment recorded first-quarter 2018 net sales of $1.7 billion, which reflected a healthy 8% improvement from the year-ago quarter. In line with this, we may expect the latest contract to boost MFC’s revenue growth in the days to come, as well.Moreover, the fiscal 2019 defense budget, recently approved by the U.S. Senate, provisions for a spending plan of $6 billion for varied missile programs. Lockheed Martin, being a prominent missile supplier for the U.S. Army and its overseas clients, is expected to gain significantly from this provision.Furthermore, the rocket and missile market is projected to grow from $55.5 billion in 2017 to $70 billion by 2022, at a CAGR of 4.74% during the forecast period (as per Markets and Markets research firm).

931,NOC,"On Monday, Jun 18, President Donald Trump expressed his desire and eagerness to take America to the top spot in the space race once again. He noted that the country’s commercial space industry has been enterprising, when it comes to breaking new ground in space exploration.Further, NASA also published a report on Jun 20 about how it plans to defend the earth from asteroid attacks. The report also states that the space agency could use the government’s help in such pursuits. Major space and defense stocks have rallied since such developments. Investors could seize such an opportunity to rake in some gains by investing in defense and space stocks.Trump Vows to Dominate SpaceThe space race seems to have fizzled out in the sense that human expeditions are few and far to come by. This stems from the fact that governments have been reluctant in sending humans to the space because of the risks involved and the huge amount of money associated to such expeditions.Speaking at the White House on Monday, Trump spoke extensively about how he planned to make America the top power in space. He also vowed to “reclaim” for his country, with the help of his team, the United States’ “heritage as the world's greatest space-faring nation.”He further stated that he wants the United States to lead explorations on Moon and Mars, essentially leaving Russia and China behind. He aspires to create a sixth branch of American military, which he termed as the “space force.”There have been decades of contemplation regarding the creation of the U.S. Space Corps, with the most recent effort being in 2017. The U.S. House Armed Services Committee even drafted a bill for the corps under the 2018 National Defense Authorization Act.NASA’s Report to the U.S. Government On Wednesday, NASA along with a few federal officials published a report on the approach that the United States should take in the coming years to protect our plant from a spate of asteroid attacks. The 18-page report, has been termed ""The National Near-Earth Object Preparedness Strategy and Action Plan."" The agenda seeks contribution from different departments within the federal government.Officials from the White House have gone on record to say that Trump’s “space force” might be used extensively in such pursuits. Trump’s space ambitions can possibly be used to fund deep space explorations in the future. Investments channeled properly for such ambitious expeditions can be used in the future.Such developments actually led to a surge in space and defense stocks. The Space Index (^SPACE) which tracks companies engaged in space and related activities has rallied approximately 1.2% since Trump’s speech. The index constitutes some of the major players from the sector, the likes of which include Boeing, Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report), AT&T (T  -  Free Report), Northrop Grumman, Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings (AJRD  -  Free Report) and Viasat  to name a few.4 Best ChoicesSince his election, Trump has vowed to get Americans back to space in a bid to reclaim the top spot in space race. Further, NASA’s commitment to safeguard the earth from celestial rocks has provided the necessary impetus for further investments in such projects.In this context, we have selected four stocks that are expected to gain from these factors. These four stocks carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).

932,NOC,"American businessman and fund manager, Richard Herman Driehaus developed an investment strategy based on the buy high and sell higher principle. This investment approach is ideal for investors having a tendency to take huge risk. Investors use this particular investment method to gain from momentum stocks. The success of this strategy helped Driehaus to make a place in Barron’s All-Century Team.The American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) proved that the strategy has the potential to offer high returns. AAII’s portfolio, which was developed following the strategy, returned 13.5% and 18.1% in the five and 10-year time frames, respectively, compared with -1.1% and 4.2% returns registered by the S&P 500. Thus, investors with a high risk appetite might give the Driehaus strategy a thought to boost returns.A Brief Note on Driehaus’ StrategyRegarding the strategy, Driehaus once said: “I would much rather invest in a stock that’s increasing in price and take the risk that it may begin to decline than invest in a stock that’s already in a decline and try to guess when it will turn around.” In keeping with his insight, AAII took into account the percentage 50-day moving average as one of the key criteria before designing a portfolio.It is calculated by dividing the numerator (month-end price minus 50-day moving average of month-end price) by the 50-day moving average of the month-end price. Another momentum indicator – positive relative strength – has also been included. A positive percentage 50-day moving average indicates that the stock is trading at a price higher than its 50-day moving average level, indicating an uptrend.Moreover, AAII found that Driehaus primarily focused on strong earnings growth rates and impressive earnings projections to pick potential outperformers. Companies with a strong history of beating estimates are also given importance in this strategy, which was made to provide better returns over the long term.Screening Parameters Our research shows that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 (Buy) and a Momentum Score of A or B offer the best upside potential.• Zacks Rank equal to #1 (Only Strong Buy-rated stocks can get through.

933,NOC,"The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) recently won a modification contract for offering supplies and services to support its P-8A aircraft program. Work related to the deal is scheduled to be over by July 2019.Details of the DealValued at $17.8 million, the contract was awarded by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, Maryland. Per the agreement, Boeing will conduct aircraft test operations, maintenance and support operation of the Naval Air System Command’s System Integration Laboratory. It will also carry out maintenance and support operation of test equipment and test asset support equipment.The majority of the task will be executed at the Naval Air Station, Patuxent River, MD. The company will utilize fiscal 2018 research, development, test and evaluation (Navy) funds to complete the modification.P-8A Jet’s SpecificationsBoeing's P-8A is an aircraft designed for long-range anti-submarine warfare, anti-surface warfare, and maritime surveillance and reconnaissance missions. The aircraft is capable of broad-area maritime and littoral operations as well.It is also effective at search and rescue missions. P-8 is a derivative of the Next-Generation 737-800, which combines superior performance and reliability with an advanced mission system to ensure maximum interoperability in the future battle space.Our ViewBoeing, being one of the major players in the defense business, stands out among its peers by virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and solid backlog. This aids the company’s defense unit — Boeing Defense, Space & Security (BDS) segment — to exhibit a solid revenue generation history.  Evidently, revenues at the BDS unit improved 13% year over year in first-quarter 2018.Moreover, Boeing’s key forte lies in manufacturing combat-proven aircraft. In fact, it has been inevitably securing large number of contracts from the Pentagon for long, courtesy of its proven expertise in aerospace programs. For instance, the aircraft giant secured a $131 million deal for MH-47G Block II jet, $1.6 billion deal for delivering 4 P-8A jets to New Zealand Air Force and a $4.2 billion contract to build variants of V-22 jets in last few days. Considering these awards, we may expect the company’s impressive top line performance to continues in the coming days.  Meanwhile, fiscal 2019 U.S. defense budget, which was approved last month, provisioned major war fighting investments of $21.7 billion for aircrafts. It also included an investment plan of $2.2 billion for 10 P-8A Poseidon jets. Such proposed inclusions reflect solid growth prospects for the BDS segment, which in turn are likely to boost Boeing’s profit margin in the future.Price MovementIn a year’s time, Boeing has surged about 67.8% compared with the industry’s 30.7% rally. The outperformance can be primarily attributed to robust worldwide demand for its commercial aircraft and military jets.Zacks Rank & Key PicksBoeing currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A few better-ranked stocks in the same space are Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report), Engility Holdings (EGL  -  Free Report) and Wesco Aircraft Holdings (WAIR  -  Free Report).

934,NOC,"The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) recently won a contract for procuring system configuration set H12K to support Kuwait government’s fleet of F/A-18E/F Aircraft. Work related to the deal is scheduled to be completed by September 2022.Details of the DealValued at $179 million, the contract was awarded by the Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, China Lake, CA. Per the terms of the deal, Boeing will procure H12K for software development, modification, integration and testing of the Kuwait Air Force configured F/A-18E/F Aircraft.Work under the agreement will be executed in St. Louis, MO. The company will utilize foreign military sales (FMS) fund to complete the task.A Brief Note on F/A-18Boeing’s F/A-18 Block III Super Hornet is a twin-engine, supersonic, all weather multirole fighter jet. Notably, it serves as the U.S. Navy’s tactical and air superiority aircraft, being capable of performing virtually every mission including air superiority, day/night strike with precision-guided weapons, fighter escort, close air support, suppression of enemy air defenses, maritime strike, reconnaissance, forward air control and tanker missions. The Super Hornet comes in two versions — the single-seat E model and the twin-seat F model.What’s Favoring Boeing?Boeing is one of the major players in the defense business and stands out among its peers by virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and solid backlog. In first-quarter 2018, revenues at its defense segment — Boeing Defense, Space & Security (BDS) — increased 13% year over year to $5.76 billion. This reflects solid volumes for international fighter jets and weapons. Moreover, the company’s backlog at BDS stood at $50 billion, 36% of which comprised orders from international clients.Surely, the FMS contracts play a key role in driving Boeing’s operational performance. In fact, the company has been receiving increased number of contracts from Kuwait for its combat proven jets. Of late, Boeing’s secured a $1.2 billion contract for delivering 28 F-18 Super Hornets to Kuwait at the end of the first quarter. We believe such contracts including the latest one should further strengthen Boeing’s position in the expanding military market overseas.  Meanwhile, in February 2018, President Trump proposed fiscal 2019 defense budget that provisions for major war fighting investments worth $21.7 billion for aircraft. Boeing, being the largest aircraft manufacturer in the United States, will surely be a significant beneficiary from this proposed budget. The financial plan further includes an investment plan of $2 billion for procuring 24 F/A-18 aircrafts. Such proposed inclusions reflect solid growth prospects for the BDS segment, which in turn are likely to boost the company’s profit margin. Price MovementIn a year’s time, Boeing has rallied about 79.8% compared with the industry’s increase of 34.6%. The outperformance was primarily led by the robust worldwide demand for its commercial aircraft and military jets.Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to Consider     Boeing currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

The jet helps the U.S. Navy to perform virtually every mission in the tactical spectrum including air superiority, day/night strike with precision-guided weapons, fighter escort, close air support, suppression of enemy air defenses, maritime strike, reconnaissance and forward air control along with tanker missions.On the other hand, Boeing’s EA-18G Growler, an advanced airborne electronic attack (AEA) platform, provides tactical jamming and electronic protection to the U.S. Navy and its respective military forces. The aircraft has 11 weapon stations for carrying electronic mission systems and weapons, which can be used to carry out conventional strike missions and suppress enemy air defenses.What’s Favoring Boeing?Boeing’s key forte lies in the manufacturing of combat-proven aircraft.

936,NOC,"In an attempt to expand its footprint in the cyber security market, L3 Technologies, Inc. (LLL  -  Free Report) recently signed an acquisition deal to purchase two information security firms — Azimuth Security and Linchpin Labs — for a total of $200 million. On completion of the takeovers, both the acquirees will combinedly operate as L3 Trenchant.L3 Technologies expects the acquisitions to be completed by the second half of 2018. While Linchpin Labs focuses on developing custom software systems and applications, Azimuth Security operates as an independent information security consultancy.Benefits of the DealThe aforementioned deal is expected to significantly boost L3 Technologies’ existing C6ISR (Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Cyber-Defense and Combat Systems, and Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance) capabilities. In fact, management believes this deal to be a strategic one in bolstering L3 Technologies’ position as a C6ISR solutions provider.On completion, positive synergies from this deal should drive the company’s future growth in cyber security market worldwide. Also, the acquired companies are expected to help L3 Technologies in delivering advanced capabilities integral to a variety of complex ISR and classified missions after the deal is closed.Post closure of the deal, L3 Trenchant is expected to add approximately $65 million to L3 Technologies’ net sales, after amortization of acquired deferred revenues, in 2019. The deal will also be slightly earnings per share accretive in 2019, post adjustment of employee retention expenses and business combination purchase accounting, including intangible asset amortization expenses.Our ViewCyber-attacks, data losses and compromised networks are constant threats, which in turn make cybersecurity essential to any given country’s national security. With the United States being the most technologically advanced country worldwide, it remains highly susceptible to cybersecurity attacks. Considering this and the fact that L3 Technologies is a prime contractor in Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) systems, the company enjoys a dominant position in U.S. cybersecurity market.In recent times, a handful of cyber-attack incidences have reflected the weaknesses of the information security space in the United States. For instance, the hacking of Equifax’s database in 2017 that compromised sensitive information of 143 million U.S. consumers and the latest Facebook data leak have highlighted the immense need to strengthen the nation’s cyber security measures.  These incidents must have prompted the U.S. administration to increase its focus on matters related to cyber security.Evidently, the U.S. fiscal 2019 budget, including $15 billion of budget authority for cybersecurity-related activities, reflects a 4.1% increase from the fiscal 2018’s spending provision. Such promising spending plans should entice companies providing cyber security solutions like L3 Technologies to strengthen their portfolio. We believe the latest buyout will enable the company to secure more cyber security related contracts from the U.S. administration in days ahead.Moreover, the cybersecurity market size is expected to grow from $137.9 billion in 2017 to $231.9 Billion by 2022, at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 11% during the forecast period (according to Markets and Markets).  Thus, L3 Technologies boasts immense growth opportunities in the global cyber security market and the latest deal should allow it to capture larger shares in this expanding market, going ahead.Price MovementIn a year’s time, shares of L3 Technologies have increased 19.6% compared with the industry’s 25.2% rally. The underperformance can be attributed to low contract orders for the company from international markets and weak performance in some of the product lines.Zacks Rank & Key PicksL3 Technologies currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A few better-ranked stocks in the same sector are Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report), Engility Holdings (EGL  -  Free Report) and Wesco Aircraft Holdings (WAIR  -  Free Report).

938,NOC,"On Jul 12, President Donald Trump in Brussels said that NATO allies have agreed to raise their defense spending to 2% of their GDP by 2024. The President further claimed that the NATO allies have committed to increase their military spending by an unprecedented amount and that many countries have agreed to reach that number sooner.However, Trump’s claims of a number of allies agreeing to raise their defense spending beyond 2% were denied by French president Emmanuel Macron. Macron said that the allies have confirmed the goal of raising their military spending to 2% by 2024.That said, Trump claimed victory in his efforts to convince the European allies to raise their defense spending. This saw a rally in defense stocks on Thursday, thus leading to a rebound in the markets that have been reeling under trade war fears. Given this scenario, it makes sense to add defense stocks to your portfolio at this point.Trump Claims Victory at NATOThe issue of increasing defense spending has been a major point of contention between the United States and other members of the 29-member block. However, on Thursday morning, Trump said that the NATO allies have committed to raising their spending on defense to 2% of their GDP by 2024. NATO allies had made the pledge in 2014 but Trump claimed that many could reach that goal sooner.However, Macron denied Trump’s claims saying that the goal remains the same as it was in 2014, that of reaching the 2% target defense spending by 2024. Interestingly, on Wednesday, Trump came up with the idea that the members of the bloc should up their defense spending to 4% of their GDP.This initiated an emergency meeting among NATO allies on Thursday morning. However, in the evening, Trump said that the members would first reach the goal of 2% and only then talks of higher contribution would be initiated. Besides the United States, only four members — United Kingdom, Greece, Poland and Estonia — contribute 2% of their GDP to defense spending.NATO Summit Becomes a Tense AffairThe NATO summit was a tense affair this time around, with Trump criticizing a number of countries for not raising their defense spending. Germany particularly was subject to Trump’s acquisitions. Currently, Germany spends only 1.1% of its GDP on defense although it had pledged to increase it to 1.5% by 2025 in May.Reportedly, on the first day of the summit, Trump openly accused Germany of being controlled by Russia, as a number of oil and gas deals have given Moscow far more influence over Berlin. However, both Germany and Russia have denied such accusations.Moreover, according to reports, Trump has made an informal suggestion to the NATO allies that they should double their defense spending from 2% to 4%. Understandably, Trump feels that the United States gets a bad deal from its allies. However, Trump claimed this to be a victory in convincing the NATO allies to reach their 2% goal by 2024, which saw defense stocks jumping on Thursday.     Our Choices The NATO summit was quite a charged-up affair at a time when U.S-Europe relations have already been soured by a trade spat. Now, increased spending on defense would mean greater demand for defense equipment, and more revenues for its players. So, it makes sense to add defense stocks to your investment arsenal at this point.However, picking winning stocks may be difficult. We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and other relevant metrics.CPI Aerostructures, Inc.

Such capabilities along with its proven expertise in aerospace programs have enabled Boeing in clinching major contracts from the Pentagon on a frequent basis.Inevitably, Boeing has been witnessing strong uptick in demand for its rotorcraft and rotary wing programs that includes the MH-47G. This latest contact win is evidence to the same and we expect Boeing to witness strong demand pull in the days ahead.Meanwhile, last month the U.S. Senate approved the fiscal 2019 defense budget that provisioned major war fighting investments of $21.7 billion for aircraft. Such budgetary developments reflect solid growth prospects for the company’s BDS segment, which, in turn, are likely to boost the company’s profit margin.Price MovementBoeing’s stock rallied about 65% in a year compared with the industry’s growth of 28.2%. The outperformance was primarily led by the robust worldwide demand for its commercial aircraft and military jets.Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to ConsiderBoeing currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). A few other top-ranked stocks in the same space are Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report), Wesco Aircraft Holdings (WAIR  -  Free Report) and Engility Holdings (EGL  -  Free Report).While Northrop Grumman sports a Zacks Rank #1, Wesco Aircraft Holdings and Engility Holdings carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

940,NOC,"This week was an eventful one with some of the major developments having a positive or negative impact on the global stock market. Below we discuss some of the biggest events that dominated the headlines and influenced the market:Trump-Kim DealThe historic summit between President Donald Trump and North Korea leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore has created history, possibly ending bitterness that lasted for 68 years. This is especially true as Trump and Kim signed an agreement, which offers undisclosed American “security guarantees” in exchange for a commitment from North Korea to “work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.” Although this is a positive step, lack of details on the denuclearization process and talks of follow-up negotiation have disappointed Wall Street.  Peace talks have pushed the defense stocks down after the summit. Major defense players -- Raytheon RTN, Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report), Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report), Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) and General Dynamics (GD  -  Free Report) -- saw rough trading on the day following the announcement of denuclearization. Of these, NOC has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) while BA and RTN have a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.AT&T-Time Warner ApprovalU.S. District Court Judge Richard Leon approved AT&T’s (T  -  Free Report) $85.4 billion purchase of Time Warner  without any condition. The long-awaited decision has paved the way for a merger frenzy, which will change the landscape of the media industry. This is especially true, as Comcast (CMCSA  -  Free Report) has made a $65 billion or $35 per share bid to acquire the film production and studio assets of Twenty-First Century Fox FOXA. The move resulted in a bidding war with The Walt Disney Company (DIS  -  Free Report), which had struck a deal in November to acquire the same assets for $52.4 billion in an all-stock deal. Each of the stocks carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) while FOX downgraded to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).  Hawkish FedAs expected, the Fed has raised interest rates for the second time this year by 25 bps to 1.75-2%. This also marks the seventh rate hike since December 2015. The central bank signaled a hawkish outlook with two more lift-offs that would translate into four total increases in 2018. The decision has led to a spike in yields. The two-year Treasury yields, which are most sensitive to shifting expectations of Fed policy, rose faster than that of 10-year and 30-year yields, narrowing the spread between the short-term and long-term yields. In fact, the yields curve flattened to the levels last seen in August 2007.Generally, a rising rate scenario is highly profitable for banks, as they seek to borrow money at short-term rates and lend at long-term rates, thereby expanding net margins and bolstering banks’ profits. But this is not the case now as short-term rates are creeping higher and long-term rates are moving up slowly, leading to a decline in net margins. Still, Northern Trust Corporation (NTRS  -  Free Report) having a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and a Momentum Score of A seems an excellent pick as its earnings are expected to grow 33.13% year over year this year.Dovish ECBThe European Central Bank (ECB), currently buying €30 billion in monthly asset program, plans to reduce its asset purchases to €15 billion from October to December and then finally end the massive program. Additionally, the bank has pledged to keep interest rates at record lows at least through the summer of 2019 pointing to a dovish outlook. The move led to strong gains for European stocks, which are poised for the best week in more than three months, while euro fell sharply.A decline in euro will actually benefit exporters and the manufacturing industry, resulting in soaring stock prices. As a result, some of the top-ranked European ADRs are poised to outperform in the coming months. Statoil ASA EQNR with a market cap of $89.2 billion and SAP SE SAP with a market cap of $148 billion have a Zacks Rank #1 and 2, respectively.World Cup Buying FrenzyThe 2018 FIFA World Cup has kicked off in Russia with the high expectation of driving growth across zones, especially in industrial spaces such as media, advertising, restaurants, hotels and airlines. Some of the top-ranked (#1 or 2) stocks in these spaces include Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report), Marriot Vacations Worldwide Corporation VAC, BJ's Restaurants, Inc. BJRI, Interpublic Group of Companies (IPG  -  Free Report), and SkyWest Inc. (SKYW  -  Free Report)  that could offer immense upside potential from the month-long event.Trump TariffTrump has approved of a plan to impose significant import tariffs on Chinese goods and is expected to announce today the first round of list for goods targeted for tariff. The move if enacted could lead to retaliation from China. Beijing earlier revealed a list of $50 billion in U.S. products that would face retaliatory tariffs, including beef and soybeans. As a result, meat producers like Tyson Foods Inc. TSN and Hormel Foods Corporation HRL could take a hit. Both stocks have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.Click for details >>

941,NOC,"General Dynamics Corp.’s (GD  -  Free Report) business division, Electric Boat, has clinched a modification contract to procure onboard repair parts for Virginia Class Submarines Pre-Commissioning Unit (PCU) New Jersey (SSN 796) and PCU Iowa (SSN 797). Work related to SSN 796 is scheduled to be over by February 2021, while that for SSN 797 is expected to be completed by August 2021.Details of the DealValued at $36.5 million, the contract was awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, DC. The deal includes option for Block IV mechanical and electronic repair parts, which will be stored on the ship while at sea.  Electric boat will utilize fiscal 2016 shipbuilding and conversion (Navy) fund to finance the task, which will be carried out in Groton, CT.A Brief Note on Virginia-Class SubmarineThe Virginia-class submarine program is a class of nuclear-powered fast-attack submarines (SSNs) serving the U.S. Navy. These submarines are designed for a broad spectrum of open-ocean and littoral missions, jointly constructed by General Dynamics and Huntington Ingalls Industries HII.Intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance operations as well as mine warfare are also carried out by these fast-attack submarines. Notably, these vessels are one of the three classes of attack submarines used by the U.S. Navy. The other two are the Los Angeles class and the Seawolf class. Valued around $2.7 billion each, these three submarines will be operational until 2070.What’s Favoring General Dynamics?General Dynamics enjoys a dominant position as a Navy contractor. This is because it is one of the only two contractors in the world, which are equipped to build nuclear-powered submarines,In December 2015, the Navy updated its force-level goal from its prior target to achieve and maintain a 308-ship fleet that comprised 48 SSNs to 355-ship fleet, including 66 SSNs. This, in turn, clearly reflects the immense priority that the U.S. Navy bestows upon this class of nuclear submarines. However, the number of SSNs is projected to decline by more than 20% over the next decade due to a smaller number of procurements done in the 90’s. This means, to reach the force-level goal, the U.S. Navy should accelerate their procurement rate in the coming days.Therefore, an increased number of procurement contracts can be expected from the Pentagon for the Virginia-Class submarines, which in turn should boost General Dynamics’ profit margin effectively.Furthermore, the U.S. Navy has acknowledged the Virginia-class program as its top priority and allotted an upmarket budget for the same. This also bodes well for General Dynamics as it is the prime contractor for this program.Price Movement    In a year’s time, shares of General Dynamics have lost 1.1% compared with the industry’s rally of 33.8%. The underperformance may have been caused by the intense competition that General Dynamics faces in the aerospace-defense space. Zacks Rank & Key Picks                                   General Dynamics currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A few better-ranked stocks in the same industry are Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report), Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) and Textron (TXT  -  Free Report). While Northrop Grumman sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Boeing and Textron carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Northrop Grumman delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 13.87% in the last four quarters.

942,NOC,"With 267 S&P 500 companies having already reported results, the Q1 earnings season has crossed the half-way mark. As of Apr 27, of these 267 index members which revealed their earnings numbers, 79.8% delivered an earnings beat, while 73.8% surpassed revenue estimates.Coming to the Zacks Aerospace sector’s projections for Q1, earnings of this space is expected to improve 37.3% on 7.5% sales growth.However, such impressive numbers failed to drive the defense stocks over the last five trading sessions. Following the historic agreement to end the Korean War last week, defense stocks performance were negatively impacted. Consequently, major indices of the Aerospace-Defense space — the S&P 500 Aerospace & Defense (Industry) index dropped 6.2%, while the Dow Jones U.S. Aerospace & Defense index slipped 5.9%.Nevertheless, quarterly results from a number of Aerospace-Defense majors — Lockheed Martin Corp.

943,NOC,"Northrop Grumman Corp.’s (NOC  -  Free Report) subsidiary, Northrop Grumman Systems Corp., recently secured a $61.8 million contract to support the Broad Area Maritime Surveillance-Demonstrator (BAMS-D) program. The contract was awarded by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD.Details of the DealPer the terms, the subsidiary will provide operator, maintenance, logistic support and sustainment engineering services for the Broad Area Maritime Surveillance-Demonstrator program. These efforts will ensure the aircraft’s capability for performing intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions.  Majority of the work will be performed in Patuxent River, MD, while the remaining work will be executed in Rancho Bernardo, CA and various forward operating locations outside the United States. Work related to the deal is expected to get completed in June 2019. Northrop Grumman will utilize fiscal 2018 operations and maintenance (Navy) funds for completing the task.Benefits of the BAMS ProgramThe Broad Area Maritime Surveillance-Demonstrator (BAMS-D), a precursor to the MQ-4C Triton program, is an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) produced for the Navy. Based on the Global Hawk unmanned air system designed for land surveillance, the BAMS-D systems are modified to work in a maritime environment that can support mission flights for more than 24 hours at high altitudes. Its sensors can cover vast areas, imaging huge swaths of territory, open oceans and littorals, providing improved surveillance pictures to fleet commanders.Our ViewWe believe that Northrop Grumman possesses significant upside potential based on the U.S. government’s increased focus on intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) programs.Northrop Grumman’s Aerospace Systems unit, which develops unmanned aircraft systems, reported first-quarter 2018 revenues of $3.28 billion that increased 9.9% year over year. We believe the latest contract along with the other notable ones that the company has secured in recent times will allow its Aerospace Systems unit to reflect similar solid results in upcoming quarters as well.Moreover, in February 2018, President Trump revealed the fiscal 2019 defense budget proposal, which included an investment plan of $13.7 billion for science and technology, which included ISR Programs. Considering such favorable budgetary revisions, we may expect the company to win more such contracts, like the latest one, in the days ahead.Price PerformanceShares of Northrop Grumman have rallied about 27.8% in a year compared with the broader industry’s growth of 40.9%. The underperformance may have been caused by the intense competition that the company faces in both domestic and international markets.Zacks Rank & Key Picks    Northrop Grumman currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

944,NOC,"Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report) recently won a $28.6 million contract for modernizing the B-2 stealth bomber defense management system. The contract was awarded by the Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma City, OK.Work related to the deal will be performed in Owego, NY and is expected to be completed by Jul 9, 2020. Lockheed Martin will utilize fiscal 2018 working capital funds for completing the task.Brief Note on B-2 Defense Management System OverhaulThe B-2 Defensive Management System Modernization/Overhaul (DMS-M) program maintains the B-2 direct attack capability while addressing emerging threats from enemy air defenses. DMS-M program upgrades the Electronic Support measures, antennas and display processing units. From a broader perspective, the B-2 DMS-M provides the B-2 fleet with advanced situational awareness, improved supportability, enhanced lethality, increased platform survivability and networked battle-space awareness. The prime contractor for the U.S. Air Force B-2 Spirit stealth bomber is Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report), which uses Lockheed Martin’s B-2 DMS-M program.Our ViewLockheed Martin’s Rotary and Mission Systems (RMS) unit is engaged in providing design, service and support for a variety of mission systems, and radar sensors for rotary and fixed-wing aircraft. We believe the latest system modernization deal will enable the segment to technologically improve other sensor-based programs offered by the company.Steady and regular order inflows tend to fuel RMS segment’s top-line growth. Notably, the company’s RMS segment recorded first-quarter 2018 sales of $3.2 billion, reflecting a 3% improvement from the year-ago quarter on account of higher sales for its sensor and C6ISR programs. In line with this, we may expect the latest contract to boost RMS’s revenue growth in the days to come, as well.Price Movement    Lockheed Martin’s stock has improved about 7.8% in the last year compared with the industry’s growth of 30.4%. The underperformance may have been caused by the intense competition the company faces in the aerospace-defense space for its broad portfolio of products and services, both domestically as well as internationally.Zacks Rank & Key PicksLockheed Martin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

945,NOC,"The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) recently announced program deliveries across its commercial and defense operations for the second quarter of 2018. The figures show a 6% rise in commercial shipments and 64.4% decline in defense shipments from the previous year.Q2 Orders & DeliveriesBoeing reported second-quarter 2018 commercial deliveries of 194 airplanes, up year over year, primarily backed by the higher demand for 737 jets. Delivery of the single-aisle 737 jet increased to 137 in the second quarter of 2018 from the year-ago number of 123.Shipments of the 777 and 787 Dreamliners totaled 13 and 38 in the second quarter compared with 21 and 33 in the year-ago period, respectively. For the 747 and 767 jets, the company delivered one and five jets, respectively, compared to three 747 and 767 jets each sold in the year-ago quarter.In its defense and space business, Boeing’s deliveries totaled 16 in second-quarter 2018, which plunged from 45 dispatched in the year-ago period. Total deliveries consisted of nine CH-47 Chinook helicopters (new and renewed), four P-8’s and three F-15 military aircraft.Boeing’s total deliveries were 210 units in the second quarter of 2018 compared to 228 delivered in the year-ago quarter.Analyzing the DeliveriesBeing the largest aircraft manufacturer, and one of the largest aerospace and defense contractors in the United States, Boeing enjoys a solid inflow of contracts from both the Pentagon as well as foreign allies, courtesy of its varied product offerings.In particular, the company’s commercial business has been gaining traction in recent days, in the form of huge inflow of jet orders from airlines worldwide. Evidently, last month Boeing inked a deal with Jet Airways to deliver 75 737 MAX Airplanes worth $9 billion. During the same time frame, it entered into a $5.6 billion agreement with Bamboo Airways to provide them with 20 787-9 Dreamliner aircraft. Such frequent and large contract wins are expected to escalate production and improve deliveries in the upcoming quarters.On the commercial front, Boeing estimates demand for 41,030 new planes, worth $6.1 trillion in the next two decades. The company expects the cost effective single-aisle jets to account for about 72% of the total projection with widebody jets likely to make up for more than 20%. This translates into worldwide demand for 29,530 single-aisle jets, worth $3.2 trillion and 8,210 widebody jets, worth $2.5 trillion. Such projections will aid Boeing in maintaining its global leadership position as one of the largest commercial jet maker.However, dearth of generous contracts for its military jets in the second quarter might have hampered the company’s defense business’ deliveries. Nevertheless, the fiscal 2019 defense budget, approved lastmonth by the U.S. Senate, includes a spending provision of $8.5 billion for the varied defense programs of Boeing. This, in turn, should boost the order growth for the company’s defense programs, in days ahead.Price MovementBoeing’s stock rallied about 68.3% in a year compared with the industry’s growth of 30.4%. The outperformance was primarily led by the robust worldwide demand for its commercial aircraft and military jets.Zacks Rank & Key PicksBoeing currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

946,NOC,"The play of mixed factors has kept U.S. defense stocks afloat in the five trailing trading sessions, with limited upside in sight. While a generous flow of funds from the Pentagon and completion of the mega merger between Northrop Grumman and Orbital ATK boosted the U.S. aerospace and defense industry, the denuclearization deal at Singapore’s summit marred the expected growth rate.In particular, shares of major U.S. defense contractors declined on Jun 12 following a conflict-free settlement of the denuclearization deal. Consequently, major indices of the Aerospace-Defense space — the S&P 500 Aerospace & Defense (Industry) index and the Dow Jones U.S. Aerospace & Defense index — inched up 0.6% in the last five trading sessions.Moreover, defense majors like The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report), Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report), Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC  -  Free Report) and General Dynamics Corp. (GD  -  Free Report) secured a few orders from the Department of Defense’s daily funding session. Also, Northrop Grumman’s Orbital ATK acquisition for $9.2 billion hit the headlines last week.Recap of Last Week’s Key Stories1. Boeing secured an $862.2 million modification contract for providing full-rate production of fifteen Lot 42 F/A-18E and three F/A-18F aircraft to the U.S Navy. The contract was awarded by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, Maryland.Majority of the work will be carried out in El Segundo, CA, St. Louis, MI and the rest would be performed in various locations across the United States. Work related to the deal is expected to be completed in June 2020 (read more: Boeing Wins $862M Navy Deal for the F/A 18 Aircraft).2. Lockheed Martin’s Aeronautics division won a $735.7 million modification contract to support the F-35 Lightning II program.

Majority of work related to the deal will be performed in Fort Worth, TX; El Segundo, CA, and Warton, the U.K. It is expected to be over by December 2019 (read more: Lockheed Martin Wins $736M Deal to Modify F-35 Jets).3. Northrop Grumman’s subsidiary, Northrop Grumman Systems Corp., clinched a $153.2-million modification contract for the delivery of a single E-2D Advanced Hawkeye Aircraft for the government of Japan. The contract was awarded by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MI.Work related to the deal will be performed in St. Augustine, FL; Syracuse, NY; Melbourne, FL; Indianapolis, IN; Aire-sur-l'Adour, France and various other locations across the United States. It is expected to complete in March 2020 (read more: Northrop Grumman Wins $153M Hawkeye Aircraft Deal From Japan).Meanwhile, Northrop Grumman announced the completion of its Orbital ATK acquisition for a total value of $9.2 billion. Interestingly, the news surfaced a day post the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) gave the final go-ahead to the deal’s closure, subject to a few conditions.In line with the FTC’s announcement, post acquisition, Orbital ATK has become Northrop Grumman’s fourth business unit under the name of Innovation Systems.The buyout is expected to be accretive to earnings per share for the first full year after the acquisition. In addition, it is estimated to generate an annual cost savings of $150 million by 2020 (read more: Northrop Grumman Completes Orbital ATK Takeover for $9.2B).4. General Dynamics’ business unit, Bath Iron Works (BIW), recently secured a contract for providing lead yard services (LYS) to DDG-51 class ships. Work related to the deal is scheduled to be over by June 2019.Valued at $50 million, the contract has been awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, DC. However, options included in this deal, if exercised, will increase the cumulative value of the agreement to $304.8 million.Majority of the work related to this deal will be performed in Bath, ME. General Dynamics will use fiscal 2014, 2016 and 2017 shipbuilding and conversion (Navy) fund for completing the task (read more: General Dynamics Wins Navy Deal to Aid DDG-51 Class Ships).PerformanceOver the last five trading sessions, the defense biggies put up a mixed show.

947,NOC,"To everyone’s surprise the first-ever formal meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and his North Korean counterpart Kim Jong-Un in Singapore was extremely successful. While the eco-political consequence of signing the denuclearization agreement at this historical meeting was a constructive one, hinting at a peace regime across the Korean peninsula, it does not bode well for the U.S. defense industry.Major U.S. defense contractors paid the price, witnessing a sudden downfall in their stocks on Tuesday, since a settlement of the long-standing conflict between these two nations may lower demand for weaponries from these contractors.Crux of the Denuclearization DealPresident Trump and Chairman Jong-Un signed an agreement at yesterday’s historical summit that aimed at averting any major military confrontation between the two nations, at least in the near term. The two primary aspects of the agreement were Kim’s renewed commitment to complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and Trump’s promise to pull out thousands of troops stationed in South Korea.While the minute details of the deal were not made public, in a press conference, Trump announced that as part of the deal America will end joint military drill with South Korea against North Korea and eventually withdraw troops from the Korean Peninsula.Defense Stocks That Took a BeatingFrequent cross-border altercations between the United States and North Korea were one of the primary driving forces behind defense stocks’ rally last year. Indeed, major U.S. defense contractors, especially the ones that manufacture high-end missiles or offer missile surveillance services, hit all-time highs, following the countering missile-test war between these two nations.Naturally, the signing of the denuclearization deal, hinting at easing of tensions between Pyongyang and Washington, sent the following defense stocks lower.Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report) provides systems, products and solutions to government and commercial customers in the areas of aerospace, mission systems and technology services worldwide. Its cyber solutions offer missile warning and defense systems. Northrop Grumman sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank  stocks here.The company’s shares have lost 1.5% since the news of denuclearization surfaced. Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report) is one of the largest aerospace and defense companies in the United States with a diversified line of military products, including missiles, radars, sensors, surveillance and reconnaissance equipment, communication and information systems, naval systems, air traffic control systems and technical services. Its notable missile system includes the Tomahawk cruise missile, an advanced surface or submarine-launched cruise missile with loitering and network communication capability. Raytheon currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The company’s shares have lost 2.8% since the announcement. Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report) is the largest defense contractor in the world, which manufactures military aircraft, Joint Light Tactical vehicle, Littoral combat ships and many more alike defense equipment. Among its varied missile programs, notable ones are the Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) and Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD). Lockheed Martin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The company’s shares lost 1.3% in the last trading session. General Dynamics (GD  -  Free Report) is a prominent military shipbuilder and is one of the only two contractors in the world equipped to build nuclear-powered submarines. It manufactures combat-proven missile destroyer ships, missile submarines as well as tactical missile aerostructures. General Dynamics currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.The company’s shares lost 1.6% following the announcement. Will the Deal Really Jeopardize Defense Growth?While the signing of the denuclearization deal has adversely impacted defense stocks, the effect will wane over time. After all, United States’ cross-border tension with North Korea was not the sole driver of U.S. defense stocks.Factors like expansionary U.S. budgetary amendments under Trump administration along with rising defense spending by other major regional powers such as Japan and India have boosted investors’ optimism in the U.S. defense industry. Also, owing to regional tensions in the Middle East, U.S. defense majors have been increasingly receiving contracts from countries like Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, which are boosting international sales. In fact, the aforementioned defense primes have been witnessing upward earnings estimate revisions even before the U.S-North Korea tension escalated, thanks to intrinsic strength of their diverse product portfolio. Moreover, analysts are skeptical about the viability of the deal over the long term. This is because North Korea had made similar commitments in the past but continued to develop nuclear weapons. In fact, following the summit, Trump said that there is no surety that there will not be a reversal of situation in another six months or so, owing to which he may act against Jong-Un. This keeps the doors open for defense majors to regain momentum. We believe signing of the deal is a small step toward maintaining peace between these two nations. Verification and monitoring will be necessary to ensure that North Korea has actually put down its nuclear weapons. For this, the U.S. government will have to rely on its defense contractors. So, all’s not lost for the U.S. defense majors.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

948,NOC,"Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) Aeronautics division recently won a $735.7 million modification contract to support the F-35 Lightning II program. The contract was awarded by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MI.Details of the DealPer the deal, Lockheed Martin will provide material and equipment for the low rate initial production (LRIP) of the 13th and 14th lots of F-35 jets. The material and equipment would be provided, following the completion of formal hardware qualification testing.Additionally, the contract will offer long-lead time materials, parts and components to support the LRIP of F-35’s 13th lot.  The modification includes 49% of the work for the U.S. Air Force, 26% for the U.S. Navy and 25% for the U.S. Marine Corps.Majority of work related to the deal will be performed in Fort Worth, TX; El Segundo, CA, and Warton, the U.K, while the rest will be executed in Nagoya, Japan and other various locations across the United States. It is expected to get completed by December 2019.The company will utilize fiscal 2018 aircraft procurement (Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps) funds for completing the task.Benefits of F-35 Lightning JetThe F-35 Lightning, which is a supersonic, multi-role fighter jet, represents a quantum leap in air-dominance capability that offers enhanced lethality and survivability in hostile, anti-access airspace environments. Its advanced stealth allows pilots to penetrate into areas without being detected by enemy radars.Due to its advanced stealth, integrated avionics, sensor fusion, superior logistics support, and powerful integrated sensors capabilities, the F-35 jet is being used by the defense forces of the United States and 11 other nations, worldwide. Looking ahead, the program’s domain is expanding notably around the globe.What’s Favoring Lockheed Martin?The F-35 program is Lockheed Martin’s largest program, which generated 24% of its total net sales in first-quarter fiscal 2018. Moreover, higher sales from the F-35 program, during the same quarter, enabled its Aeronautics segment’s revenue to grow 7% year over year to $4.4 billion. As of May 14, 2018, the company successfully delivered more than 290 F-35 jets to the United States and its allies.Lockheed Martin, being one of the Pentagon’s prime contractors, enjoys a steady flow of contracts each year and the second quarter of fiscal 2018 has not been any exception either. In May, the company secured a contract worth $558 million to support the low-rate initial production of F-35 Lightning II aircraft of the 11th lot. Considering the frequent order inflows, we expect its Aeronautics unit to reflect similar solid performance in the coming quarterly results as well.Moreover, production of F-35 is expected to rise in the years ahead, given the U.S. government’s current inventory objective of 2,456 aircraft for the Air Force, Marine Corps and Navy along with commitments from the company’s eight international partners and rising international demands.Furthermore, the fiscal 2019 defense budget proposal, announced by Trump this February, provisions for a spending plan of $21.7 billion on aircraft. The budget proposal hints at a prospective increase in Lockheed Martin’s F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program that has been allotted $10.7 billion along with additional funding for the procurement of 97 F-35 Joint Strike Fighters. Evidently, these developments reflect solid growth prospects for Lockheed Martin’s F-35 program going ahead, which, in turn, are likely to boost the company’s profit margin.Price Movement    Lockheed Martin’s stock has improved about 15.3% in the past year compared with the industry’s gain of 42.9%. The underperformance may have been caused by the intense competition that the company faces in the aerospace-defense space for its broad portfolio of products and services, both domestically as well as internationally.Zacks Rank & Key Picks    Lockheed Martin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Buy). A few better-ranked stocks in the same space are Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report), The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) and Wesco Aircraft Holdings, Inc. (WAIR  -  Free Report).While Northrop Grumman sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Boeing and Wesco Aircraft carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

949,NOC,"General Dynamics Corporation’s (GD  -  Free Report) business unit, Bath Iron Works (BIW), recently secured a contract for providing lead yard services (LYS) to DDG-51 class ships. Work related to the deal is scheduled to be over by June 2019.Contract DetailsValued at $50 million, the contract has been awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, DC. However, options included in this deal, if exercised, would bring the cumulative value of the agreement to $304.8 million.Per the deal, BIW will offer necessary engineering, technical, material procurement and production support; configuration; class flight and baseline upgrades and new technology support; data and logistics management; lessons learned analysis; acceptance trials; post-delivery test and trials. Also, the deal provisions for post-shakedown availability support; reliability and maintainability; system safety program support; material and fleet turnover support; shipyard engineering team; turnkey; crew indoctrination, design tool/design standardization, detail design development as well as other technical and engineering analyses.Such efforts are likely to support construction as well as test and trials of the DDG 51 Class ship. Furthermore, DDG 51 Class LYS has provisions for offering design, engineering, procurement and manufacturing/production services to support design feasibility studies and analyses. These additional supports will modify DDG 51 Class destroyers for Foreign Military Sales (FMS) programs sponsored by the Department of the Navy and the Department of Defense.Majority of the work related to this latest deal will be performed in Bath, ME. General Dynamics will use fiscal 2014, 2016 and 2017 shipbuilding and conversion (Navy) fund for completing the task.A Brief Note on DDG-51 The DDG 51 Arleigh Burke-class is a multi-mission warship. It features an advanced anti-submarine warfare system, the AEGIS combat system, the Vertical Launching System, two embarked SH-60 helicopters along with advanced anti-aircraft missiles and land-attack missiles. Impressively, the warship offers defense against a wide range of threats, including ballistic missiles.What’s Favoring General Dynamics?General Dynamics’ Marine Systems business segment has an extensive experience in the construction of nuclear submarines, surface combatants and auxiliary ships. BIW, a unit of this segment, provides lifecycle support services for Navy surface ships. Interestingly, as of February 2018, the company secured construction contracts for six DDG-51s, scheduled for delivery through 2024. This reflects the solid demand that this class of ships boast, indicating at the possibility of increased revenue recognition from this program in the coming days.In first-quarter 2018, Marine System’s revenues totaled $2,034 million, reflecting year-over-year growth of more than 5%. We may expect the latest contract win along with the aforementioned delivery contracts to add more impetus to this segment’s growth in the near future.Furthermore, President Trump’s proposed fiscal 2019 defense budget includes an investment plan of $179.1 billion for the U.S Navy. Notably, this financial plan was up 4% compared with the fiscal 2018 budget request. Considering such favorable budgetary revisions, General Dynamics, a prominent shipbuilder in the United States, is expected to win similar contracts from the U.S. Navy moving ahead.Price Movement    In a year’s time, shares of General Dynamics have gained 1.7% compared with the industry’s rally of 43.3%. The underperformance may have been caused by the intense competition that the company faces in the aerospace-defense space.Zacks Rank & Key Picks                                   General Dynamics currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

950,NOC,"Northrop Grumman Corp.’s (NOC  -  Free Report) business unit, Northrop Grumman Systems Corp., recently secured a modification contract for providing Large Aircraft Infrared Counter Measures (LAIRCM) equipment and support. Work related to the deal is scheduled to be over by Apr 30, 2020.Details of the DealValued at $209.7 million, the contract was awarded by the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Wright Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. Per the terms, this modification will take the total cumulative face value of the deal to $1.6 billion.A minor portion of the agreement includes foreign military sales LAIRCM acquisitions to South Korea. Notably, the funds for fiscal 2016, 2017 and 2018 aircraft procurement, National Guard, Navy as well as operations and maintenance will be utilized to finance the task. The project will be executed in Rolling Meadows, IL.What’s LAIRCM?The LAIRCM system is essential and critical for the safety of onboard troops in a hostile situation. It is an active countermeasure that can automatically detect a missile launch. On identifying a missile, LAIRCM determines if it is a threat and activates a high-intensity, laser-based countermeasure system to track and destroy the missile on its own, with no action required by the crew. The primary purpose of the LAIRCM program is to protect large aircraft from man-portable missiles.Why Northrop Grumman?Of late, terrorist groups have been increasingly using cheap yet deadly man-portable missiles. Thus, an effective anti-missile solution for the protection against such threats is the need of the hour and a well-equipped, developed nation like the U.S. will always want to be well prepared for any sudden assault.Moreover, throughout 2017, repeated missile threats from North Korea have forced the United States to ramp up its focus toward its missile defense space. Undoubtedly, this has led the Trump administration to multiply its arsenal treasury, both in terms of attacking missiles as well as accumulating protective measures like LAIRCM.Currently, Northrop Grumman’s AN/AAQ-24(V) Directional Infrared Countermeasure (DIRCM) system is the only DIRCM system in production that can protect an aircraft from infrared-guided missiles. LAIRCM is one variant of such a DIRCM.Considering the present situation in the nation and Northrop’s combat-proven LAIRCM, more contracts like the latest one can be expected to boost the company’s sales.Meanwhile, on Feb 12, 2018, the Pentagon unveiled the fiscal 2019 budget proposal. This financial plan provisions spending of $716 billion on national security, including funds of  $686.1 billion for the Pentagon. It includes $617.1 billion as base budget, highlighting a 17.8% increase from the current continuing resolution level. Being one of the largest aerospace-defense players in 2017, we expect Northrop Grumman to benefit from the budget reflecting increased spending provision for the country’s defense.Price PerformanceShares of Northrop Grumman have rallied about 44.8% in a year compared with the broader industry’s gain of 47.3%. The underperformance might have been caused by intense competition that the company faces in both domestic and international markets.Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to Consider    Northrop Grumman carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). A few better or similar-ranked stocks in the same space are Huntington Ingalls (HII  -  Free Report), Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) and Wesco Aircraft Holdings (WAIR  -  Free Report). While Huntington Ingalls sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Boeing and Wesco Aircraft carry the same bullish rank as Northrop Grumman. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Huntington Ingalls delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 3.85% in the trailing four quarters. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings has moved north by 30.2% in the past 60 days.Boeing pulled off an average positive earnings surprise of 20.69% in the past four quarters. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings inched up 0.9% over the last 60 days.Wesco Aircraft delivered a positive earnings surprise of 25% in the previous quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings climbed 9.4% over the last 60 days.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

951,NOC,"Following a chemical attack in Douma near the Syrian capital Damascus which claimed around 60 lives, the Trump administration is weighing its military options against Syria. In case the United States decides to launch military actions against Syria it is likely to receive support from France’s president Emmanuel Macron and Britain’s prime minister Theresa May.Several other countries are willing to support the United States in its move against the Syrian government of President Assad. The Trump government’s likely air strikes will not be limited to Syria but will also be aimed at its major supporters, Russia and Iran. In this context, Russia has already warned the United States of retaliatory actions. With both United States and Russia likely to conduct military actions against each other related to Syria, defense stocks seem to be a lucrative investment choice.What Happened In Douma?On Apr 7, Douma, a rebel-held western Syrian city near Damascus witnessed a serious attack when chemical bombs were dropped on the region. Following the attack, around 60 people including women and children lost their lives, while more than 1,000 were injured. President Trump slammed this attack calling its “heinous” and “atrocious” and said that the United States has “a lot of options militarily” to answer to this.Last April, Syria’s Shayrat airbase, which acted as a launch pad for a poisonous gas attack on the city of Khan Sheikoun, was attacked and neutralized by the United States. The Trump administration along with its ally countries are now thinking of conducting a similar or even higher scale of attack on Al Dumayr air base, which acted as the launching point for Apr 7’s supposed chemical assault on Douma.Trump Condemns Douma Chemical AttackOn Apr 12, the President Trump warned Russia, a key supporter of Syria’s Assad government to “get ready” for the chemical attack on the city of Douma. Meanwhile, both Syria and Russia responded to Trump’s tweet, Syria's Foreign Ministry issued a statement, calling this a “reckless escalation.” Maria Zakharova, spokesperson of Russia’s Foreign Ministry said smart missiles should be directed toward terrorists and not a “legal government,” which has carried out its fight against “international terrorism for several years on its territory.”Earlier, Trump called Syria’s move an attack on humanity and said that Syria supported by Iran’s ground forces and Russia’s air transportation will “pay a price.” In fact, President Trump canceled his first visit to South America and instead chose to carefully watch “the American response to Syria,"" per a White House statement.Russia in No Mood to Sit BackAdditionally, on Apr 11, in a UN Security Council meeting, Russia clearly said that in case the United States conducts any missile strike on Russia or even Syria, it will answer back with similar moves. Vladimir Putin-led country will answer United States’ action with similar moves. In the meeting, Vasily Nebenzia, the representative of Vladimir Putin-led Russia to the United Nations, requested the United States to “refrain from the plans” being developing at present. He warned that if the United States carries out any ""illegal military adventure,"" it will have to ""bear responsibility"" for that.Separately, Alexander Zasypkin, Russia’s ambassador to Lebanon reportedly said that if the United States conducts any air strike, “the missiles will be downed” and “the sources from which the missiles were fired"" will also be eliminated. In this fight between two permanent members of the UN, the United States and Russia, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) will position a team “shortly” in Syria to evaluate whether banned chemical weapons were used in the Douma attack.5 Best Defense StocksBoth the United States and Russia have given clear signals of military actions against one another, which have brought the spotlight back on companies that are involved in the defense industry. In this context, we can say that Syria’s attack on Douma city has clearly shifted focus on companies involved in the manufacture and processing of defense equipment.We have selected five stocks that are expected to gain following these developments.

The figures show an 8.9% rise in commercial shipments and 40.5% decline in defense shipments from the previous year.Q1 Orders & DeliveriesBoeing reported first-quarter 2018 commercial deliveries of 184 airplanes, up year over year primarily backed by higher demand for 737 jets. Delivery of the single-aisle 737 jet increased to 132 in the first quarter of 2018 from 113 a year ago.Shipments of the 777 and 787 Dreamliners totaled 12 and 34, compared with 21 and 32 in the year-ago period, respectively. For the 747 and 767 jets, the company delivered 2 and 4 jets, respectively compared with 1 and 2 in the year-ago quarter.In its defense and space business, Boeing’s deliveries totaled 25 in first-quarter 2018, down from 42 dispatched in the year-ago period.

The company recently received an order worth $12 billion to deliver 47 787-9 Dreamliners to American Airlines. A week back it also received orders worth $8.8 billion for 75 737 MAX Airplanes from Jet Airways. In terms of its Defense business, Boeing recently secured a $1.2 billion deal to support Kuwait's F/A-18 Jets. Such frequent and large contract wins are surely expected to ramp up production and improve Boeing’s deliveries in the second quarter.Moreover, in February 2018, President Trump proposed fiscal 2019 defense budget that provisions for an investment plan of $21.7 billion for defense aircrafts. Boeing is expected to gain significantly from this budgetary provision, as it includes an investment plan of $8.5 billion for its varied defense programs.On the commercial front, Boeing estimates demand for 41,030 new planes, worth $6.1 trillion in the next two decades. The company expects cost effective single-aisle jets to be the major demand driver, accounting for 72% of the total projection along with widebody jets, comprising over 20%. This translates into worldwide demand for 29,530 single-aisle jets, worth $3.2 trillion and 8,210 widebody jets, worth $2.5 trillion. Such projections will aid Boeing in maintaining its position as one of the largest aerospace and defense contractor worldwide.Price MovementBoeing’s stock has rallied about 87.5% in a year, compared with the broader industry’s gain of 45.7%. The outperformance was primarily led by the robust worldwide demand for its commercial aircraft and for its military jets. Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to Consider    Boeing currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).A few other top-ranked stocks in the same sector are Huntington Ingalls (HII  -  Free Report), Curtiss-Wright Corporation (CW  -  Free Report) and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report).

955,NOC,"The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) recently won an $862.2 million modification contract for providing full-rate production of fifteen Lot 42 F/A-18E and three F/A-18F aircraft to the U.S Navy. The contract was awarded by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, Maryland.Details of the DealMajority of the work will be carried out in El Segundo, CA, St. Louis, MI and the rest would be performed in various locations across the United States. Work related to the deal is expected to get complete in June 2020.Growing Demand of F/A-18Boeing’s Super Hornet aircraft is continuously evolving to outpace future threats. Its radar, mission computers and sensors continue to evolve in order to meet extensive mission profiles. Due to the ever rising worldwide demand of military aircraft, Boeing has also developed the Advanced Block III Super Hornet to complement existing and future air-wing capabilities, which include battle-space situational awareness, counter stealth targeting, increased acceleration and improved survivability.Such major developments have enabled Boeing in witnessing strong demand for its fighter aircraft and major aerospace programs, including the F-18 aircraft. This is evident from the contract that it secured from Kuwait in the first quarter for delivering 28 F-18 Super Hornets. We believe that this latest contract will also help in substantiating Boeing jet fighters’ strong position in the global market.What’s Favoring Boeing?As Boeing’s key forte lies in manufacturing combat-proven aircraft, it has inevitably secured large number of contracts from the Pentagon for long, courtesy of its proven expertise in aerospace programs. Subsequently, revenues of its Defense, Space & Security (BDS) segment witnessed a 13% rise year over year to $5.76 billion in first-quarter 2018.Further, last month Boeing entered into an agreement to acquire KLX Inc., a major independent provider of aviation parts and services in the aerospace industry. The acquisition, once completed, will certainly help Boeing to enhance its global parts distribution and supply chain services, accelerate Global Service’s growth strategies, and position the company in effectively serving customers in a $2.6- trillion, 10-year services market.Meanwhile, President Trump proposed fiscal 2019 defense budget in February that provisioned major war fighting investments of $21.7 billion for aircraft. Further, it also included an investment plan of $2 billion for procuring 24 F/A-18Jets. Such proposed inclusions reflect solid growth prospects for the BDS segment, which in turn are likely to boost the company’s profit margin.Price MovementBoeing’s stock rallied about 94.5% in a year compared with the industry’s growth of 43.3%. The outperformance was primarily led by the robust worldwide demand for its commercial aircraft and military jets.Zacks Rank & Key Picks    Boeing currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Work related to the deal is scheduled to be completed by August 2020.A Brief Note on RMS UnitLockheed Martin’s RMS segment provides design, manufacture, service and support for a variety of military and commercial helicopters, ships and submarine missions and unmanned and combat systems. In addition, it also offers simulation and training services. Its customers include the U.S. Army and Navy, and various government agencies of the United States and other countries along with commercial customers.What’s Favoring Lockheed Martin?Being Pentagon’s largest contractor, Lockheed Martin enjoys a steady flow of contracts from the Department of Defense. The company acquired a massive $3.5-billion deal last month to provide army training solutions.Lockheed Martin’s RMS segment recorded sales of $4.4 billion in fourth-quarter 2017, which reflected a year-over-year improvement of 14.2%. We believe, the aforementioned contract wins, along with the latest one, will allow this segment to deliver similar notable performance in the days ahead.Moreover, in February 2018, President Trump proposed fiscal 2019 defense budget that provisions for an investment plan of $6 billion for varied missile programs. Lockheed Martin is expected to gain significantly from this budgetary provision, as it includes an investment plan of $2.8 billion for varied missiles.The global rocket and missile market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 4.74% during 2017-2022 time frame to reach a value of $70 billion by 2022 (as per Markets and Markets research firm), due to increasing geopolitical conflicts and terrorism. Such projections reflect improved growth opportunities for missile-makers like Lockheed Martin, in the years to come.Price Movement    Lockheed Martin’s stock has returned about 24.8% over a year, compared with the broader industry’s gain of 43.8%.

957,NOC,"The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) recently secured a modification contract worth $50 million for original equipment manufacturing of (OEM) Royal Saudi Air Force F-15SA fighter jet. Work related to this deal is expected to be over by Aug 6, 2019.Details of the DealThe contract was awarded by the 338th Specialized Contracting Squadron, Joint Base San Antonio Randolph, Texas. Per the terms, the latest modification offers a one-year extension to the existing contract’s performance period, thus taking the total cumulative face value of the deal to $305 million.Foreign military sales funds will be used to carry out the task in Khamis, Saudi Arabia.A Brief Note on F-15Boeing’s F-15 Strike Eagle is a twin-engine, all-weather tactical fighter aircraft. Its proven design is unbeatable in air-to-air combat, with more than 100 aerial combat victories. The F-15SA is a variant of F-15 that has been developed for the Royal Saudi Air Force.Notably, the F-15SA model provides improved performance and increased survivability at a lower life-cycle cost. The aircraft has two additional wing stations for increased payload and capability.Our ViewWith rising security threats across the globe, apart from developed nations like the United States, developing economies like Saudi Arabia are ramping up their arsenal. Considering the fact that the United States is the largest exporter of weaponries in the world and Boeing is one of the largest aerospace and defense contractors, the company has served as a loyal partner for Royal Saudi Air Force in defending its nation.Interestingly, over the years, Boeing has developed a genial relationship with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (""KSA""). The company’s defense unit started doing business with the nation following Royal Saudi Air Force’s purchase of F-15C/D fleet in 1978. Notably, this remains the mainstay of KSA’s air defense till date.Since then, Boeing has been winning a number of contracts from the KSA for advanced military weaponries. Of the latest notable deals, in August 2017, the company won a $223-million contract for supplying eight CH-47F new helicopters to support the Royal Saudi Land Forces Aviation Command.Additionally, to further strengthen its ties with KSA, Boeing announced on Mar 30, 2018 that it has signed a Memorandum of Agreement with Saudi Arabian Military Industries to form a new Joint Venture (""JV"") worth $450 million. The JV will help to localize more than 55% of the maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) services for fixed and rotary-wing military jets in Saudi Arabia. It goes without saying that the latest contract win will allow the company to expand its footprint in KSA, which has bountiful prospects.These developments is likely boost Boeing’s defense unit’s growth trajectory, which registered a 5% sales growth in the fourth quarter of 2017, reflecting a top line worth $5.5 billion.Price MovementBoeing’s stock has surged about 80.5% in a year compared with the broader industry’s gain of 43%. The outperformance was primarily backed by robust worldwide demand for its commercial aircraft and military jets.Zacks Rank & Key Picks   Boeing carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

958,NOC,"Northrop Grumman Corp.’s (NOC  -  Free Report) subsidiary, Northrop Grumman Systems Corp., recently secured a $153.2-million modification contract for the delivery of a single E-2D Advanced Hawkeye Aircraft for the Government of Japan. The contract was awarded by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MI.Details of the DealWork related to the deal will be performed in St. Augustine, FL; Syracuse, NY; Melbourne, FL; Indianapolis, IN; Aire-sur-l'Adour, France and various other locations across the United States. It is expected to complete in March 2020.Importance of E-2D Advanced Hawkeye Aircraft in JapanAs Japan looked to strengthening its Air Force arsenal, in 2014, the Japan Air Self Defense Force (JASDF) opted for THE E-2D Advanced Hawkeye to fulfill the nation’s Airborne Early Warning and Control (AEW&C) requirements. This advanced weaponry was selected as it featured the powerful AN/APY-9 radar, designed to provide 360° coverage against hostile aircraft and cruise missiles.In November 2017, the first flight of Japan’s E-2D Advanced Hawkeye was successfully executed. This was a significant milestone in delivering advanced airborne early warning and surveillance capabilities to the Japan Air Self Defense Force (JASDF). Consequently, the procurement of the latest deal would strengthen Northrop’s commercial relationship with the country as well as strengthen Japan’s ability to meet the evolving security and intelligence needs.Northrop’s International SalesNorthrop Grumman, being one of the major defense companies in the United States, enjoys heavy inflow of international orders for its varied products. Notably, the company had international sales of $870 million in the first quarter of 2018, which also included Foreign Military Sales, reflecting 12.9% of total overseas sales made by the company.Northrop Grumman ProspectsNorthrop Grumman’s Aerospace Systems (AS) unit, which develops and designs military aviation aircraft, manned aircraft, autonomous systems and spacecraft, witnessed a successful first quarter in terms of sales, primarily led by higher volumes on manned aircraft.Notably, the company’s Aerospace Systems unit reported first-quarter 2018 revenues of $3.28 billion that increased 9.9% year over year. We believe the latest contract, along with the other notable ones which the company won in recent times, will allow its Aerospace Systems unit to reflect similar solid results in the upcoming quarters as well.Recently, the company acquired rocket and missile maker Orbital ATK for $9.2 billion. This strategic buyout will enable Northrop Grumman to enhance its product portfolio and capability in manufacturing technologically advanced combat platforms. It will also benefit from the Orbital ATK’S knowledge and expertise in satellites, spacecraft components and commercial space-launch systems. Moreover, the acquisition will lead to strong combined cash flow generation that will further support financial flexibility going forward.Furthermore, President Trump proposed the fiscal 2019 defense budget in February that provisioned major war fighting investments of $21.7 billion for aircraft. Such inclusions reflect solid growth prospects for AS segment, which in turn, are likely to boost the company’s profit margin.Price PerformanceShares of Northrop Grumman have rallied about 32% in the past year compared with the broader industry’s gain of 42.9%. The underperformance may have been caused by the intense competition that the company faces in both domestic and international markets.Zacks Rank & Key Picks    Northrop Grumman carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

959,NOC,"Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report) recently announced the completion of its Orbital ATK acquisition for a total value of $9.2 billion. Interestingly, the news surfaced a day post the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) gave the final go-ahead to the deal’s closure, subject to a few conditions.In line with the FTC’s announcement, post acquisition, Orbital ATK has become Northrop Grumman’s fourth business unit under the name of Innovation Systems.Details of the DealThe acquisition deal was originally announced by Northrop Grumman in September 2017. The transaction value includes $7.8 billion in cash and remaining $1.4 billion in debt.We believe that the final regulatory nod for the deal has encouraged Northrop Grumman to add the benefits from this acquisition to its full-year result, even before the official completion of the merger. Surely, the expected operational results of Orbital ATK, nay Innovation Systems, have led Northrop Grumman to raise its 2018 financial guidance.Benefits of the AcquisitionWith Orbital ATK's incorporation, Northrop Grumman sees an opportunity to enhance its product portfolio and capability in manufacturing technologically advanced combat platforms. In particular, the acquirer will benefit from the acquiree’s knowledge and expertise in satellites, spacecraft components and commercial space launch systems.Orbital ATK's incorporation not only enhances capabilities, innovation and competition for customers in the critical global scale domains but also provides a meaningful shareholder value-creation opportunity for Northrop Grumman, driven by strategic fit, revenue synergies from new opportunities and cost savings.Moreover, the buyout is expected to be accretive to earnings per share for the first full year post the acquisition and is also estimated to generate an annual cost savings of $150 million by 2020. The transaction will also lead to strong combined cash flow generation that will further support financial flexibility and continued execution of capital deployment strategy.What Lies Ahead for Northrop Grumman?President Trump had proposed a fiscal 2019 defense budget in February 2018 that provisioned investments of $6 billion for various missile programs and $4.3 billion for space capabilities. Such proposed inclusions reflect solid growth prospects for Northrop Grumman’s newest Innovation Systems segment, which in turn are likely to boost the company’s overall profit margin.Moreover, Orbital ATK's incorporation will also increase Northrop Grumman’s workforce strength by expert officials of the acquiree that will further enable the latter to offer new innovative and enhanced products to its customers.Further, global rocket and missile market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 4.74% during 2017-2022 to reach a value of $70 billion by 2022 (as per Markets and Markets research firm). With Orbital ATK’s acquisition, such projections reflect improved growth opportunities for Northrop Grumman, in the coming days.Price PerformanceShares of Northrop Grumman have rallied about 32.4% in a year compared with the industry’s gain of 41.8%.

962,NOC,"L3 Technologies, Inc. (LLL  -  Free Report) recently secured a contract per which the company will procure new training systems as well as hardware and software upgrades for F/A-18C/D/E/F and EA-18G jets. Work related to this deal is scheduled to be over by April 2023.Valued at $218.1 million, the contract was awarded by the Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division, Orlando, FL. The latest deal will modify the existing aircrew training systems for these military aircraft. Further, this contract will support software configuration set upgrades, engineering change proposals, Naval Aviation Simulation Master Plan upgrades and spare parts for hardware deliverables.Fiscal 2016 aircraft procurement (Navy) and 2018 operation and maintenance (Navy) funds will be utilized to partly finance the task, which will be carried out in Arlington, TX.A Brief Note on F/A-18 & EA-18G JetsBoeing’s (BA  -  Free Report) F/A-18 Block III Super Hornet is a twin-engine, supersonic, all weather multirole fighter jet. The U.S. Navy’s tactical and air superiority aircraft is capable of performing virtually every mission in the tactical spectrum, including air superiority, day/night strike with precision-guided weapons, fighter escort, close air support, suppression of enemy air defenses, maritime strike, reconnaissance, forward air control and tanker missions.The company’s EA-18G Growler is the most advanced airborne electronic attack platform which operates from either an aircraft carrier or from land bases. The aircraft helps combat electronic attack and suppresses enemy air defenses, particularly at the start and at early stages of on-going hostilities. The major contractor Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report) manufactures the rear and center fuselage sections of this jet.What’s Favoring L3 Technologies?Due to rising political uncertainties and terrorism worldwide, especially the growing crisis in the Middle East, the defense industry is gaining traction. Countries, throughout the world, are increasing their expenditure on various defense equipment, with aircraft being one of their top priorities.The United States is the largest spender in defense space. Apart from manufacturing high-end military jets, providing state-of-the-art training to pilots along with other software and hardware upgrades to aircraft form an integral part of the nation’s defense aircraft management.L3 Technologies’ Aerostructures business unit provides avionics hardware and software systems, while its Electronic Systems business segment offers aircraft simulation and training systems. In fact, realizing the expanding market for aircraft simulation and training market, L3 Technologies acquired Doss Aviation last September.Doss Aviation is the sole provider of initial flight training for U.S. Air Force pilots and offers curriculum coursework and flight training to both fixed-wing and unmanned aircraft pilots. Thus, by purchasing Doss Aviation, L3 Technologies significantly expanded its footprint in the military aircraft simulation and training market worth multi-billion-dollar.In February 2018, President Trump proposed fiscal 2019 defense budget that provisions for major war fighting investments of $21.7 billion for aircrafts, which includes an investment plan of $2 billion for procuring 24 F/A-18 aircraft. With F/A-18 and EA-18 aircraft being in high demand, procurement contracts for these jets from Pentagon will boost L3 Technologies’ profit margin, as the company will offer these jets’ necessary technological upgrades.With the budget including facilities investment of $10.5 billion, along with training solutions, we expect L3 Technologies to win more such contracts like the latest one in the coming days.Price PerformanceL3 Technologies stock has returned 25% over a year, underperforming the 28.9% rally of the industry it belongs to. This might have been caused by the weak performance that the company has been witnessing in some of its product lines. The downward trend in margins for service-related work due to competitive pressure remains a concern.  Zacks Rank & Key PickL3 Technologies currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the same sector is Huntington Ingalls Industries (HII  -  Free Report), which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

963,NOC,"A day ago, after Caterpillar (CAT  -  Free Report) ushered in a stellar Q1 earnings report, pre-market futures were zooming up. Q1 earnings season in general was going along swimmingly, and it looked like Tuesday trading was off to the races.Well, a funny thing happened in CAT’s Q1 conference call — CEO Jim Umpleby was quoted as saying Q1 represented a “high water mark” for Caterpillar’s 2018 earnings, which caused a hasty reassessment among market participants, and trading in the markets, the Dow in particular, sank like a stone.For sure, Mr. Umpleby has learned a valuable lesson about what to say (or what NOT to say) in his company’s conference call, but Caterpillar remains within a strong cycle overall. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating and a Zacks Style Score (Value, Growth, Momentum) of B.What we caution investors to learn from this is something akin to “all that glitters is not gold.” Meaning although a company may provide excellent top and bottom-line quarterly numbers, market sentiment — especially when economic realities are making traders a bit more sensitive these days, such as a 3% 10-year bond yield pointing toward higher interest rates in the future — may turn on a dime. And what we should take away is the understanding that jumpiness among market participants is a reality; stick with your strategy to find light at the end of the tunnel, and don’t give into hysteria.So, with that in mind, here are some highlights from a few of the big names reporting earnings results ahead of Wednesday’s opening bell:The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) is trading up 2.74% in today’s pre-market on solid top and bottom-line beats this morning. Earnings of $3.64 per share outpaced the $2.59 in the Zacks consensus, and revenues in the quarter of $23.38 billion surpassed the $22.32 billion analysts were expecting. Beating estimates is nothing new for Boeing: its trailing 4-quarter earnings beat average is above 20%. Also in the quarter, Boeing bought back $3 billion worth of company shares and paid out a total of $1 billion in dividends. For more on BA’s earnings, click here.Keeping in the Aerospace arena a moment, Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report) also easily topped earnings and revenue estimates in its Q1: $4.21 per share on $6.74 billion in revenues beat the $3.63 per share and $6.58 billion, respectively. Its Aerospace division rose 10% year over year, and this marks at least the fifth straight earnings beat for the Zacks Rank #2, Style Score B-rated company. For more on NOC’s earnings, click here.One more from this sector: General Dynamics (GD  -  Free Report), a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company, posted a 7% beat on the bottom line to $2.65 per share. Revenues of $7,535 million was a smidge under Zacks consensus — so call this a mixed earnings report — on revenue growth of 1.3% year over year. For more on GD’s earnings, click here.Also, Comcast (CMCSA  -  Free Report) reported earnings ahead of the opening bell today, with 62 cents per share and $22.79 billion in the quarter outperforming the 59 cents per share and $22.72 billion expected, up 10.7% on the company’s top line. Internet customer net adds grew 379K, partially augmented by a loss of 96K Video customers. The company also formally announced its big for the 61% of Sky Communications it doesn’t already own. For more on CMCSA’s earnings, click here.

964,NOC,"Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC  -  Free Report) recently cleared the final regulatory red tape in its acquisition of Orbital ATK , following the receipt of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC) approval for the deal. Notably, the FTC nod succeeds the European Commission’s approval received in February 2018.We expect Northrop Grumman to duly complete the buyout within the first half of 2018, now that it has got through the last lap of regulatory approvals. However, this clearance remains subject to condition that the acquirer shall supply the solid rocket motors to competitors for missile contracts. Also, operations of the two companies must remain segregated.About the DealIn September 2017, Northrop Grumman announced that it has signed an agreement to purchase rocket and satellites-maker Orbital ATK for a total cash of $7.8 billion. Additionally, it disclosed plans to setup Orbital ATK as a new and fourth business unit, on the deal’s closure.Through this merger, Orbital ATK’s knowledge and expertise in satellites, spacecraft components and commercial space launch system will significantly expand Northrop Grumman’s product offering.Also, Orbital ATK's contracts with the NASA and the U.S. Army are expected to boost Northrop Grumman’s product portfolio and rake in more than $4.8 billion in the form of annual revenues, according to Orbital’s 2017 financials.Positive Synergies Led to Raised ViewEarlier, Northrop Grumman announced that post the merger, this new business unit will be accretive to earnings per share and free cash flow during the remaining months of 2018. In particular, adding Orbital ATK will boost Northrop Grumman’s earnings per share and free cash flow in the first year of acquisition and lead to annual cost savings of nearly $150 million by 2020.Keeping up with its earlier announced strategy, Northrop Grumman will name its fourth business unit as Innovation Systems, post integration of Orbital ATK. We believe the final regulatory nod for the deal has encouraged Northrop Grumman to add on the benefits from this acquisition to its full-year result, even before the official completion of the merger. Surely, the expected operational results of Orbital ATK, nay Innovation Systems, have led Northrop Grumman to raise its 2018 financial guidance.In particular, post the merger, Northrop Grumman expects to generate earnings in the range of $16.20-$16.45 on revenues of $30 billion in 2018. This reflects a solid improvement when compared with the company’s earlier earnings guidance of $15.40-$15.65 per share on revenues of $27 billion. Northrop Grumman has also raised its guidance for free cash flow from $2-$2.3 billion to $2.3-$2.6 billion for 2018.Looking AheadNew macro challenges along with rising completion are lately prompting aerospace and defense industry players to revisit their business models as well as expand core operations and product lines. We believe Northrop Grumman’s proposal to buy Orbital ATK last year was also driven by similar rationale.So far, Northrop Grumman provided satellite communications, but now, with Orbital ATK in its business, the company will be able to manufacture satellite. This, in turn, will enable the acquirer to win major contracts from NASA, thereby adding to length and breadth of its existing product portfolio.With similar expansion agenda in mind, General Dynamics (GD  -  Free Report) completed the acquisition of IT service provider CSRA Inc. in April 2018 for $9.7 billion. Realizing the increasing demand for technology software and services worldwide, this deal should serve as a strategically fit step for General Dynamics to expand its footprint in the cybersecurity space.Price PerformanceIn a year’s time, shares of Northrop Grumman have rallied about 30% compared with the industry’s increase of 41.8%. The underperformance may have been caused by the higher operating expenses that the company incurs, which tend to weigh on its profit margin.Zacks Rank Northrop Grumman has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A better-ranked stock in the same industry is Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Boeing has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarter, with an average positive surprise of 29.51%.

965,NOC,"Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) Aeronautics business segment recently clinched a contract in relation to F-35 jets. Work related to the deal is scheduled to be over by December 2018.Details of the DealValued at $14.4 million, the contract was awarded by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, Maryland. Per the terms of the deal, the company will offer emerging capabilities and analysis systems engineering to include programmatic and logistics tasks. These efforts will analyze the F-35 air system's ability to meet future operational requirements, investigate cost and weight reduction program options, and conduct modeling and simulation activities.The contract also include provisions for additional assessments such as analyzing changes to design life, operational readiness, reliability, and air system design and configuration.  Fiscal 2018 research, development, test and evaluation (Navy) funds will be utilized to complete the task at Fort Worth, TX.F-35 AttributesLockheed Martin’s F-35 Lightning II is a single-seat, single-engine 5th Generation fighter aircraft, which comes with an advanced stealth feature combined with enhanced fighter speed and agility, fully-fused sensor information, network-enabled operations and advanced sustainment. Currently, three variants of F-35 are set to replace five fighter jets for the U.S. Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps as well as a variety of fighter jets for at least 10 other countries.With Lockheed Martin being the primary partner, the F-35 program has been supported by an international team of leading aerospace majors. While, Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report) rendered its expertise in carrier aircraft and low-observable stealth technology to this program, BAE Systems’ (BAESY  -  Free Report) short takeoff and vertical landing experience, and air systems sustainment supported the jet’s combat capabilities. Also, Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies (UTX  -  Free Report), provided F-35s with the F135 propulsion system — the world's most powerful fighter engine.Recent DevelopmentsThe F-35 program is Lockheed Martin’s largest program, which generated 24% of its total net sales in first-quarter 2018. As of May 14, 2018, the company delivered more than 290 F-35 jets to the United States and its allies.However, critics earlier condemned this program as the costliest military program for the U.S. government. It was only after President Trump’s intervention, in February 2017, that Lockheed Martin ultimately announced its decision to cut down F-35’s cost significantly.Now, the company’s current cost-saving initiative to lower sustainment costs for F-35 project is expected to result in cost savings of $1 billion over a five-year period. In sync with this, per a recent report by Lockheed Martin, it targets to reduce the cost of an F-35A to $80 million by 2020, with production enhancements.Also, additional improvements implemented in these planes like the software upgrades, which were a part of this latest contract, will allow the company to further reduce the cost of this program. Moreover, with the U.S. government’s current inventory objective of 2,456 F-35 aircraft alongside its reduced price we may expect to witness a continued ramp up in the production of these jets in coming days. No doubt, Lockheed Martin enjoys a solid growth prospect for F-35 program, which in turn, will surely boost its profit margin.Price MovementIn a year’s time, shares of Lockheed Martin have rallied about 15.5% compared with the industry’s increase of 41.7%. The underperformance was most probably caused by the intense competition that the company faces domestically as well as internationally. Zacks Rank Lockheed Martin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

966,NOC,"Northrop Grumman Corp.’s (NOC  -  Free Report) subsidiary, Northrop Grumman Systems Corp., recently secured an $866 million multiple-line item contract from the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Peterson Air Force Base; Colorado. Work related to the deal is scheduled to get completed by May 31, 2023.Details of the DealPer the deal, Northrop Grumman will be entrusted with the duty for sustainment and modification of radar sensors, providing depot-level sustainment services and modification projects for the Ballistic Missile Early Warning systems and PAVE Phased Array Warning system radars along with the Parameter Acquisition Radar Attack Characterization system. Work related to the deal will be performed in Colorado Springs, CO and other locations across the United States.A Brief on Northrop Grumman’s Radar SystemNorthrop Grumman has been a leader in providing multi-mission radar solutions from sea to outer space over the last six decades. Its Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar solutions help in providing high degree of resistance to electronic jamming techniques. Also, AESA radar solutions create high-bandwidth data links between aircraft and other equipped systems, and possess low interception capabilities from enemy radars.What’s Favoring Northrop Grumman?Northrop Grumman has witnessed significant radar-related success from investments made in Gallium Nitride (GaN), which further helps in amplifying radio energy for radars, jammers and other devices. Such investments should help Northrop Grumman to develop more effective and highly resistant radar solutions, in the days to come.Northrop Grumman’s Mission Systems (MS) unit develops various sensors and processors, which represented 50% of the unit’s sales in the first quarter. Notably, this unit reported first-quarter 2018 revenues of $2.88 billion that inched up 3% year over year.In February, President Trump revealed the fiscal 2019 defense budget proposal, which included an investment plan of $13.7 billion in matters pertaining to science and technology. Considering such favorable budgetary revisions and the U.S. government’s increased focus on cyber, command, control, communications and computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (C4ISR) programs, we expect the company to win more such radar-related contracts in days ahead.Price PerformanceShares of Northrop Grumman have rallied about 29.1% in a year compared with the industry’s gain of 39.5%. The underperformance may have been caused by the intense competition that the company faces in both domestic and international markets.Zacks Rank & Key Picks    Northrop Grumman carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

967,NOC,"The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) recently secured a contract to deliver 47 787-Dreamliner aircrafts to American Airlines, the world’s largest airline. Per the terms, the airline will recieve 22 787-8 and 25 787-9 Dreamliners from Boeing to expand and modernize its fleet.This deal is expected to open new routes for American Airlines across the globe, including Europe and Asia Pacific region. The deal is valued at more than $12 billion at current list prices and will make the airline Boeing’s largest 787-Dreamliner customers in Western Hemisphere.A Brief Note on Boeing 787Boeing’s 787 is the fleet of fastest selling twin-aisle jet till date. The aircraft is built with lightweight composite materials and powered by advanced engines, which is 20% more fuel efficient than Boeing 767. The models of the 787 fleet involved in this deal are the 787-8 Dreamliner, equipped to fly 242 passengers up to 7,355 nautical miles, as well as 787-9, which can fly 290 passengers up to 7,635 nautical miles.The 787 Dreamliner fleet contains Smooth Ride Technology, which allows it to sense turbulence and automatically adjust wing control surfaces for a smoother ride. Such sensors are located throughout the aircraft.Boeing and American AirlinesWith this deal, Boeing has strenghtened its relationship with American Airlines, its largest customer for more than 80 years. It currently delivers the 737 Max, Next Generation 737, 777 and 787 jets to the Seattle-based airline company. Boeing’s Global Services division provides American Airlines with efficient tools such as Airplane Health Management and Toolbox, which improves operational performanc and dispatch reliability.What’s Ahead for Boeing?Per Boeing’s latest market outlook, the world will need 41,030 new planes, worth $6.1 trillion, between 2017 and 2036. The company expects widebody jets to be a strong driver, comprising 20% of the total projection. This translates into worldwide demand for 8,210 widebody jets, worth $2.5 trillion, over the next 20 years.Notably, with the 787 fleet leading the widebody jet space, Boeing has achieved more than 1350 orders for the same, till date. We may expect the company to win more similar orders in the quarters ahead. This in turn will add impetus to Boeing’s Commercial Airplanes unit, which posted revenues of $56.7 billion in 2017, improving 8% on a year-over-year basis.

968,NOC,"Rising fears of a trade war between China and the United States unnerved investors, sending Wall Street on a bumpy ride for past few weeks. In particular, the market tumbled on President Trump’s proposal of imposing a tariff of $60 billion on Chinese imports. In retaliation China threatened to levy a hefty tariff on a number of American goods.  However, these developments did not have any major impact on the U.S. defense stocks. In fact, the recent joint venture (JV) that aircraft major Boeing formed with Saudi Arabian Military Industries is likely to keep the U.S. defense industry on a growth trajectory. The deal is also likely to boost the growth prospects of other defense majors as well. Evidently, a few of them have already started to win contracts from Saudi Arabia. Consequently, major indices in the Aerospace-Defense industry ended in the green over the past five trading sessions. Both the S&P 500 Aerospace & Defense (Industry) index and the Dow Jones U.S. Aerospace & Defense index rose 1.7%, over that time frame. Moreover, keeping with its usual trend, the U.S. defense industry witnessed a generous flow of funds from the Pentagon over the trailing five sessions.Among the highlights of the last week, defense majors Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report), The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report), Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report), General Dynamics Corp. (GD  -  Free Report) and Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report)  secured a number of orders from the Department of Defense’s daily funding session. General Dynamics completed the CSRA acquisition.Recap of Last Week’s Key Stories1. Raytheon secured a contract fordelivering Patriot Missile Systems to Poland, after the country signed a Letter of Offer and Acceptance (“LOA”) agreement with the U.S. government.Per Reuters, this deal, valued at $4.75 billion, requires Raytheon to deliver two Patriot System Batteries, each with two fire units in 2022. This is a major achievement for Raytheon, since in spite of the U.S. State Department having cleared a potential $10.5 billion sale of four Patriot defense systems to Poland last November, the deal got stuck in cross-border negotiations.Per the agreement, Raytheon will continue to work with Polish defense companies and help them build key parts of the missile system (read more: Raytheon to Gain From US-Poland $4.8B Deal for Patriot). 2. Boeing won a contract worth $1.2 billion for providing long-lead non-recurring engineering to develop a baseline configuration for the production and delivery of 22 F/A-18E and 6 F/A-18F Super Hornets. These services will be providedto the government of Kuwait.The contract was awarded by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, Maryland. Per the terms, Boeing will offer long-lead radar warning receivers and aircraft armament equipment. The deal is expected to be completed by September 2022.Majority of the work will be executed in Hazelwood, MI; Goleta and El Segundo,CA (read more: Boeing Wins $1.2B Deal to Support Kuwait's F/A-18 Jets).Moreover, the company secured a delivery order worth $430 million to provide F/A-18 planned maintenance interval-1 high flight hour depot support. This is a five-year contract with no option periods.The contract was awarded by the Defense Logistics Agency Aviation, Philadelphia, PA. Work related to the deal will be carried out in Missouri, California, Florida and North Carolina and is expected to be completed by Mar 29, 2023 (read more: Boeing Wins $430M Deal for Maintenance Support of F/A-18 Jets).Further, the company’s Defense Space and Security segment clinched a $312-million ceiling increase modification contract for providing Joint Direct Attack Munition (“JDAM”) tail kits. The contract has been awarded by the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Hill Air Force Base, Utah.Per the terms, Boeing will offer additional JDAM strap-on inertial guidance kits that will receive guidance updates from global positioning systems. This will enhance the accuracy of conventional inventory bombs.Work related to the deal will be performed in St. Louis, MO, and is scheduled to be completed by Mar 30, 2020 (read more: Boeing Wins $312M Air Force Contract for JDAM Tail Kits).3. Lockheed Martin secured a $279-million modification contract for Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) missiles under the foreign military sales (“FMS”) program. Per the deal, the company will modify the PAC-3 missiles production contract to include cost reduction initiative (CRI) missiles and associated ground support equipment. The deal will cater to Saudi Arabia.The contract was awarded by the U.S. Army Contracting Command, Redstone Arsenal, Alabama. Operations related to the deal will be carried out in Grand Prairie and Lufkin, TX; Camden, AZ; Chelmsford, MA; Ocala, FL and Huntsville, AL.Work related to the deal is scheduled to be completed by Feb 28, 2023 (read more: Lockheed Wins $279M FMS Contract for PAC-3 Missiles).Moreover, the company’s Aeronautics business segment won a contract worth $211.3 million for offering Block 4.1 common capabilities pre-modernization efforts to support the preliminary design review of F-35 Lightning II jets.

Work related to the deal is scheduled to be over by December 2023.The contract was awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, DC. The agreement is a joint U.S./U.K. Common Missile Compartment program, which will be carried out in Quonset Point, RI.The U.S. Navy will purchase 72% of the modification, while the government of the U.K. will acquire the remaining 28%, under the FMS program (read more:General Dynamics Wins $126M Deal to Aid Nuclear Submarines).Meanwhile, General Dynamics recently completed the acquisition of IT service provider CSRA Inc. After engaging in a brief period of bidding war against CACI International, General Dynamics successfully acquired CSRA on Apr 3, for $9.7 billion, which includes a $2.8 billion debt.CSRA has thus become part of General Dynamics’ Information Systems & Technology segment. Following the closure of the transaction, General Dynamics has acquired all of CSRA’s outstanding shares for $41.25 per share in cash.The acquisition is anticipated to be accretive to the company’s earnings per share and cash flow next year. Further, the deal is expected to generate annual pre-tax cost savings of 2% of the combined company's revenue by 2020 (read more: General Dynamics Completes CSRA Acquisition for $9.7B).5. Huntington Ingalls’ Newport News business unit has won a modification contract worth $180 million for the purchase of additional long-lead-time material in support of PCU Enterprise (CVN 80).  Work related to the deal is scheduled to be completed by February 2027.The contract was awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C.  Fiscal 2018 shipbuilding and conversion (Navy) funding will be utilized to finance the task, which will be carried out in Newport News, VA.PerformanceOver the last five trading sessions, the defense biggies put up a solid show. Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report) gained the most with its share price rising 3.1% in this period.Over the last six months as well, the entire industry has put up a stellar performance. Keeping up with its usual trend, Boeing once again gained the most, with its shares surging 30.1%, followed by Northrop Grumman.The following table shows the price movement of the major defense players over the past five trading days and during the last six months.CompanyLast WeekLast 6 MonthsLMT2.57%10.19%BA2.61%30.10%GD0.19%3.64%RTN1.88%17.21%NOC3.17%23.01%COL0.11%1.81%TXT1.10%7.06%LLL2.45%12.49% Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

969,NOC,"The tariff dispute, which has been playing spoilsport, has intensified with President Donald Trump’s latest rhetoric on a potential trade war with China. Trump is seeking a further tariff of $100 billion against China in addition to the already proposed $50 billion of tariffs on Chinese goods, targeting robotics, information technology, communication technology and aerospace.Earlier this week, Washington planned to slap a 25% tariff on 1,300 China-made products, which include a wide array of products including raw materials, construction machinery, agricultural equipment, electronics, medical devices and consumer goods. These goods belong to industries, such as aerospace and agricultural equipment, which were the key growth areas of China over the next seven years.The new taxes came a day after China hit back with likely 25% duties on 106 American goods including soybeans, corns, aircraft, and vehicles worth an estimated $50 billion, against Trump’s similar threat in response to alleged intellectual property theft. The second-largest economy has already imposed a duty on 128 American food products, including meat, fruit, pork, dried fruits, wine and aluminum scrap, worth $3 billion effective Apr 2, in retaliation against Trump’s severe tariff of 24% on steel and 10% on aluminum imports.The round of sanctions and retaliation could trigger a global trade war, hurting worldwide economy and corporate profits at big U.S. exporters. As such, several corners of the broad market and various industries are in distress. In particular, large-caps stocks, which derive most of their revenues outside the United States especially China, appear vulnerable. On the other hand, small caps, which provide true domestic exposure, should be safe and better plays in case the tit-for-tat situation turns into a full-blown trade war.So let’s pick a couple of stocks from industries on China’s hit list for a match up to see which one is in the line of fire and which is guarded well enough to survive the tariff onslaught.The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) versus Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report)Boeing would be hit hard from the proposed Chinese tariff, as it is the top U.S. exporter to China and will buy about $1 trillion worth of its aircraft over the next 20 years. On the other hand, NOC would remain unscathed by the dispute. Boeing has shed 4.6% in a month while NOC has gained 4.4%. Both stocks have a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Deere & Co. (DE  -  Free Report) versus Hormel Foods Corporation (HRL  -  Free Report)Farming equipment maker Deere could be among the biggest losers as the proposed China tariff on agricultural products would reduce demand for the related machines while packaged food companies like Hormel could see a boost resulting from cheaper commodity prices, including soybeans and corns, on weak Chinese demand. Both stocks have a Zack Rank #2. Shares of DE are down 3.6% over the past month while HRL has climbed 6.8%.DowDuPont Inc (DWDP  -  Free Report) versus Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM  -  Free Report)DowDuPont’s agriculture unit is expected to be hurt by price declines in soybeans. The stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). On the other hand, Archer Daniels Midland could benefit from reduced prices. American agricultural producers export about $20 billion worth of products to China each year. Of this, $14.6 billion comprises soybeans and the rest include cotton, wheat and corn. ADM has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Caterpillar Inc. (CAT  -  Free Report) versus H&E Equipment Services Inc. (HEES  -  Free Report)Caterpillar is vulnerable to the trade dispute as it has heavy exposure to China. Meanwhile, H&E Equipment Services is a small-cap stock and does not do business in China. CAT has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), while HEES has a Zacks Rank #2. Both stocks were beaten down over the past month.General Motors (GM  -  Free Report)) versus Tesla (TSLA  -  Free Report)American automakers would be the worst hit from the proposed tariff and a potential trade war. In particular, China has been General Motors’ largest retail market for six consecutive years as the automaker sold four million vehicles in 2017 for the first time ever. Meanwhile, Tesla also seems to be the biggest loser as China has threatened more import tariff on electric cars. Out of the two, GM still seems attractive with a Zacks Rank #1, while Tesla has a Zacks Rank #4.Tyson Foods Inc. (TSN  -  Free Report): A Wild CardAs Tyson Foods is the world's largest processor and marketer of chicken, beef, and pork, it is likely to be impacted by China’s 25% tariff on pork and pork products. Notably, China is the third-largest consumer of U.S. pork and bought about $1.1 billion worth of pork products from the United States last year, according to the U.S. Meat Export Federation. However, a possible duty on soybean would reduce the price of the commodity due to large supplies and thereby result in reduced cost for meat companies like Tyson. As such, Tyson is both a beneficiary and a loser in this series of tariff attack. The stock has a Zacks Rank #1 and a top VGM Score of A.Bottom LineAll the buzz has resulted from the Trump administration, which is seeking to reduce the U.S. trade deficit with China by $100 billion. Last year, the United States had a record $375-billion trade deficit with China, while China reported a U.S. trade surplus of $276 billion.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

970,NOC,"Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) Aeronautics business segment recently won a contract for offering Block 4.1 common capabilities pre-modernization efforts to support the preliminary design review of F-35 Lightning II jets. The deal will cater to the U.S. Air Force and the nation’s overseas partners.Details of the DealValued at $211.3 million, the contract was awarded by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, Maryland. Work related to this deal will be carried out in Fort Worth, TX.Fiscal 2018 research, development, test and evaluation (Air Force); and international partnership funds will be utilized to partially finance the task. The project is expected to be completed by July 2019.F-35 AttributesLockheed Martin’s F-35 Lightning II is a single-seat, single-engine 5th Generation fighter aircraft that comes with an advanced stealth feature combined with enhanced fighter speed and agility, fully fused sensor information, network-enabled operations and advanced sustainment. In fact, three variants of F-35 are set to replace five fighter jets for the U.S. Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps as well as a variety of fighter jets for at least 10 other countries.With Lockheed Martin being the primary partner, the F-35 program has been supported by an international team of leading aerospace majors. While, Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report) rendered its expertise in carrier aircraft and low-observable stealth technology to this program, BAE Systems’ (BAESY  -  Free Report) short takeoff and vertical landing experience as well as air systems sustainment supported the jet’s combat capabilities. Moreover, Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies (UTX  -  Free Report), provided F-35s with the F135 propulsion system, which is the world's most powerful fighter engine.Recent DevelopmentsThe F-35 program is Lockheed Martin’s largest program, which generated 25% of its total net sales and 64% of Aeronautics division’s net sales in 2017. Evidently, the company’s top line grew 12% in the fourth quarter at its Aeronautics segment, primarily driven by the F-35 program.Meanwhile, Lockheed Martin seems to be enjoying a steady flow of contracts from the Pentagon each year and 2018 is no exception. Last month, the company won a modification contract worth $1.5 billion for the purchase of long lead material and parts related to low rate initial production (LRIP) of F-35 Lightning II air systems. Considering these contract wins, we expect the Aeronautics unit to reflect similar solid performance in the first quarter of 2018 as well.Moreover, production of F-35 is expected to continue for many years, given the U.S. government’s current inventory objective of 2,456 aircraft for the Air Force, Marine Corps and Navy; commitments from the company’s eight international partners and three international customers as well as expressions of interest from other countries.Additionally, Trump recently proposed fiscal 2019 defense budget that provisions for a spending plan of $21.7 billion on Aircraft. In particular, the These developments reflect solid growth prospects for Lockheed Martin’s F-35 program, which in turn are likely to boost the company’s profit margin. Budget proposal hints at an increase in Lockheed Martin’s F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program and has allotted $10.7 billion for procurement of 77 F-35 Joint Strike Fighters.Price Movement             In the past year, Lockheed Martin has gained about 27.9% compared with the broader industry’s rally of 47.2%.The underperformance may have been caused by the intense competition that the company faces in the aerospace-defense space for its broad portfolio of products and services, both domestically and internationally.Zacks Rank                                                          Lockheed Martin carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

971,NOC,"Wednesday, April 25, 2018A day ago, after Caterpillar (CAT  -  Free Report) ushered in a stellar Q1 earnings report, pre-market futures were zooming up. Q1 earnings season in general was going along swimmingly, and it looked like Tuesday trading was off to the races.Well, a funny thing happened in CAT’s Q1 conference call — CEO Jim Umpleby was quoted as saying Q1 represented a “high water mark” for Caterpillar’s 2018 earnings, which caused a hasty reassessment among market participants, and trading in the markets, the Dow in particular, sank like a stone.For sure, Mr. Umpleby has learned a valuable lesson about what to say (or what NOT to say) in his company’s conference call, but Caterpillar remains within a strong cycle overall. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating and a Zacks Style Score (Value, Growth, Momentum) of B.What we caution investors to learn from this is something akin to “all that glitters is not gold.” Meaning although a company may provide excellent top and bottom-line quarterly numbers, market sentiment — especially when economic realities are making traders a bit more sensitive these days, such as a 3% 10-year bond yield pointing toward higher interest rates in the future — may turn on a dime. And what we should take away is the understanding that jumpiness among market participants is a reality; stick with your strategy to find light at the end of the tunnel, and don’t give into hysteria.So, with that in mind, here are some highlights from a few of the big names reporting earnings results ahead of Wednesday’s opening bell:The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) is trading up 2.74% in today’s pre-market on solid top and bottom-line beats this morning. Earnings of $3.64 per share outpaced the $2.59 in the Zacks consensus, and revenues in the quarter of $23.38 billion surpassed the $22.32 billion analysts were expecting. Beating estimates is nothing new for Boeing: its trailing 4-quarter earnings beat average is above 20%. Also in the quarter, Boeing bought back $3 billion worth of company shares and paid out a total of $1 billion in dividends. For more on BA’s earnings, click here.Keeping in the Aerospace arena a moment, Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report) also easily topped earnings and revenue estimates in its Q1: $4.21 per share on $6.74 billion in revenues beat the $3.63 per share and $6.58 billion, respectively. Its Aerospace division rose 10% year over year, and this marks at least the fifth straight earnings beat for the Zacks Rank #2, Style Score B-rated company. For more on NOC’s earnings, click here.One more from this sector: General Dynamics (GD  -  Free Report), a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company, posted a 7% beat on the bottom line to $2.65 per share. Revenues of $7,535 million was a smidge under Zacks consensus — so call this a mixed earnings report — on revenue growth of 1.3% year over year. For more on GD’s earnings, click here.Also, Comcast (CMCSA  -  Free Report) reported earnings ahead of the opening bell today, with 62 cents per share and $22.79 billion in the quarter outperforming the 59 cents per share and $22.72 billion expected, up 10.7% on the company’s top line. Internet customer net adds grew 379K, partially augmented by a loss of 96K Video customers. The company also formally announced its big for the 61% of Sky Communications it doesn’t already own.

972,NOC,"The Boeing Company’s (BA  -  Free Report) Defense Space and Security segment recently won a $312-million ceiling increase modification contract for providing Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) tail kits. The contract has been awarded by the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Hill Air Force Base, Utah.Details of the DealPer the terms, Boeing will offer additional JDAM strap-on inertial guidance kits that would receive guidance updates from global positioning systems. These upgrades will enhance the accuracy of conventional inventory bombs.Work related to the deal will be performed in St. Louis, MO, and is scheduled to be completed by Mar 30, 2020. Boeing will utilize fiscal 2018 procurement, operations and maintenance funds to finance the task.A Brief Note on JDAMJDAM is a low-cost guidance tail kit that converts existing unguided free-fall bombs into guided weapons accurately. The JDAM kit consists of a new tail section that contains an inertial navigation system/global positioning system (INS/GPS) and body strakes for additional stability and lift. With the help of JDAM, bombs can be accurately delivered in any weather conditions and be launched at a great distance from the target.The U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy and the militaries of more than 26 additional countries employ JDAM. Its latest version, JDAM Extended Range features a modular add-on wing kit that will unfold in flight. The kit can also be coupled with other modular enhancements such as laser sensors.Our ViewBoeing Defense Space and Security (BDS) segment delivered a solid performance last year in terms of revenues and margins along with securing key contracts and achieving critical program milestones, including its ongoing progress on the tanker program. Impressively, the BDS segment was able to clinch massive orders totaling $10 billion during fourth-quarter 2017.Moreover, the segment witnessed an approximate 5% year-over-year increase in fourth-quarter revenues to $5.54 billion, driven by higher weapon deliveries. The company’s backlog for the segment was $50 billion. We expect contract wins like the latest one to enable the company to deliver such notable performance in quarters ahead as well.Meanwhile, in February 2018, President Trump proposed fiscal 2019 defense budget that provisions for a $3-billion investment in Boeing’s 15 KC-46 Tanker Replacements, $2 billion for procuring 24 F/A-18s, $1.3 billion for 60 AH-64E Attack Helicopters and $2.2 billion for 10 P-8A jets.  Moreover, the company has of late been witnessing solid funding support above the President's budget request for a number of programs, including the F-18, CH-47 Chinook, Ground-Based Midcourse Defense, AH-64 Apache, the V-22 and space launch system.These are indicative of the fact that Boeing, being one of the primary defense contractors in the United States, can be expected to win more defense contracts in the days to come, which in turn will boost its profit margin substantially.Price MovementBoeing’s stock has rallied about 84.9 % in a year, compared with the broader industry’s gain of 47.3%. The outperformance was primarily led by the robust worldwide demand for its commercial aircraft as well as military jets. Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to Consider    Boeing currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).A few other top-ranked stocks in the same sector are Huntington Ingalls (HII  -  Free Report) and Curtiss-Wright Corporation (CW  -  Free Report) and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report).

Currently, three variants of F-35 are set to replace five fighter jets for the U.S. Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps as well as a variety of fighter jets for at least 10 other countries.With Lockheed Martin being the primary partner, the F-35 program has been supported by an international team of leading aerospace majors. Notably, Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report) rendered its expertise in carrier aircraft and low-observable stealth technology to this program, BAE Systems’ (BAESY  -  Free Report) short takeoff and vertical landing experience, and air systems sustainment supported the jet’s combat capabilities. Also, Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies (UTX  -  Free Report), provided F-35s with the F135 propulsion system — the world's most powerful fighter engine.Recent DevelopmentsThe F-35 program is Lockheed Martin’s largest program, which generated 24% of its total net sales in first quarter of 2018. As of May 14, 2018, the company delivered more than 290 F-35 jets to the United States and its allies.However, critics have condemned this program as the costliest military program for the U.S. government. It was only after President Trump’s intervention, in February 2017, that Lockheed Martin ultimately announced its decision to cut down F-35’s cost significantly.Now, the company’s current cost-saving initiative to lower sustainment costs for F-35 project is expected to result in cost savings of $1 billion over a five-year period. In sync with this, per a recent report by Lockheed Martin, it targets to reduce the cost of an F-35A to $80 million by 2020, with production enhancements.Also, additional improvements implemented in these planes like the software upgrades, which were a part of this latest contract, will allow the company to further reduce the cost of this program. Moreover, with the U.S. government’s current inventory objective of 2,456 F-35 aircraft alongside its reduced price we may expect to witness a continued ramp up in the production of these jets, in coming days. No doubt, Lockheed Martin enjoys a solid growth prospect for F-35 program, which in turn, will surely boost its profit margin.Price MovementIn a year’s time, shares of Lockheed Martin have rallied about 14.2% compared with the broader industry’s increase of 39.7%. The underperformance was most probably caused by intense competition that the company faces domestically as well as internationally.Zacks Rank Lockheed Martin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

975,NOC,"Per Reuters, The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) recently entered into an agreement with the second largest Indian-based airline — Jet Airways — for delivering 75 737 MAX narrow body aircrafts. The deal is in line with Indian airlines’ latest rush to expand their fleets to meet the rising demand in the country for both domestic and international flights.The deal value amounts to approximately $8.8 billion at current list prices which might get lower once the deal finalizes, as airlines typically receive a significant discount on big orders from manufacturers. However, it is still unknown whether the agreement was a formal order or a non-binding memorandum of understanding.Boeing’s Prospects in IndiaDue to the increase in airborne passenger and cargo traffic, major airlines from all over the world, including Indian based airlines, are increasing their fleet size to meet the growing demand. According to the International Air Transport Association, the domestic Indian passenger traffic witnessed a 17.5% rise in January 2018 from the previous year.In light of these developments, India has emerged as a promising market for Boeing, with the country expected to become the world’s fastest growing aviation market. According to the company, the country will need 2,100 new planes worth $290 billion in the next 20 years, up 13.5% from the year-ago estimate of 1,850 planes. Indian airlines currently have a fleet of 490 planes and ordered 880 more planes.No doubt the latest deal with Jet Airways reflects the expanding jetliner demand in India and Boeing, being the largest jet maker in the world, will surely benefit from it.Q4 Deliveries Driven by 737 FleetBoeing reported fourth-quarter 2017 commercial deliveries of 209 airplanes, up 13% year over year backed by higher demand for 737 and 747 jets. Sequentially, the numbers went up 3.5%. Delivery of the single-aisle 737 jet increased to 148 in the fourth quarter compared to 122 jets a year ago. This shows that the 737 fleet drives the company’s quarterly deliveries and order wins and the upcoming quarters will be no exception.What’s Ahead for Boeing?Per Boeing’s latest market outlook, the world will need 41,030 new planes, worth $6.1 trillion, between 2017 and 2036. The company expects single-aisle jets to be the major demand growth driver, comprising 72% of the total projection. This translates into worldwide demand for 29,530 single-aisle jets, worth $3.2 trillion, over the next 20 years.Notably, with the 737 fleet leading the single-aisle jet space, we expect the company to win more such orders like the latest one, for this fleet in quarters ahead. This in turn will provide further impetus to Boeing’s Commercial Airplanes unit, which garnered revenues of $56.7 billion in 2017, driven by 763 and 737 MAX airplane deliveries.Price MovementBoeing’s stock has rallied about 85.1 % in a year, compared with the broader industry’s gain of 46%. The outperformance was primarily led by the robust worldwide demand for commercial and military jets. Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to ConsiderBoeing currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).A few other top-ranked stocks in the same sector are Huntington Ingalls (HII  -  Free Report) and Curtiss-Wright Corporation (CW  -  Free Report), each flaunting a Zacks Rank #1, and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report) carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

976,NOC,"The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) recently secured a delivery order to provide F/A-18 planned maintenance interval-1 high flight hour depot support. This is a five-year contract with no option periods.Valued at $430 million, the contract was awarded by the Defense Logistics Agency Aviation, Philadelphia, PA. Work related to the deal will be carried out in Missouri, California, Florida and North Carolina and is expected to be completed by Mar 29, 2023.Defense working capital funds for fiscal 2018 through 2023 will be utilized to finance the task.A Brief Note on F/A-18Boeing’s F/A-18 Block III Super Hornet is a twin-engine, supersonic, all weather multirole fighter jet. The U.S. Navy’s tactical and air superiority aircraft is capable of performing virtually every mission in the tactical spectrum, including air superiority, day/night strike with precision-guided weapons, fighter escort, close air support, suppression of enemy air defenses, maritime strike, reconnaissance, forward air control and tanker missions.Boeing believes that the Super Hornet is the most cost-effective aircraft in the U.S. tactical aviation fleet, costing less per flight hour than any other tactical aircraft in U.S. forces inventory.What’s Favoring Boeing?Boeing is one of the major players in the defense business and stands out among its peers by virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and solid backlog. With aeroplanes being its flagship product, the company has been witnessing strong demand for its fighter aircraft and major aerospace programs, including the F/A-18 jets.Evidently, the Fiscal 2018 budget required 80 Super Hornets over the next five years as part of the Future Years Defense Program, including funding for Research Development, Test & Evaluation for Block III capabilities.  Moreover, the U.S. Navy added an additional 10 Super Hornets into the FY18 budget as its No. 1 unfunded priority.Meanwhile, in February 2018, President Trump proposed fiscal 2019 defense budget that provisions for major war fighting investments of $21.7 billion for aircrafts. Being the largest aircraft manufacturer in the United States, Boeing willsurely be a significant beneficiary once this budget gets Senate’s approval. The budget also includes an investment plan of $2 billion for procuring 24 F/A-18 aircrafts.Notably, these developments, along with the latest contract win should provide impetus to Boeing’s defense segment’s growth, which generated revenues of $5.54 billion in the last reported quarter.Price MovementIn a year’s time, Boeing’s stock has surged about 82.5 % compared with the broader industry’s gain of 44.6%. The outperformance was primarily led by significant demand for its military jets along with robust worldwide demand for its commercial aircraft. Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to Consider    Boeing sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

980,NOC,"The defense space kick-started the Q1 earnings season with Textron (TXT  -  Free Report) releasing results on Apr 18. This multi-industry conglomerate’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate.  Today, sector behemoth Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report results. In fact, majority of the defense giants are expected to release financial numbers this week.As of Apr 20, 87 S&P 500 index members reported their quarterly results, wherein earnings increased 25% on 10.7% higher revenues. The space’s earnings are anticipated to record an 18.3% increase on 7.7% higher revenues, while two of the 16 Zacks sectors are likely to suffer a decline in earnings. We expect to have a clear picture of the space’s performance by the end of this week as 178 of the index members are scheduled to release their quarterly figures.As of Apr 20, total Q1 earnings from the broader Aerospace sector are expected to increase 14.9% year over year on 4.6% higher revenues.  For more details on quarterly releases, you can go through our Earnings Preview.Defense stocks remained on a growth trajectory in the first quarter, courtesy of fiscal 2019 defense budget proposal presented by President Trump. Of the total amount, $686.1 billion has been reserved as funding for the Pentagon, reflecting 5% real growth over the initial FY18 President’s budget and 10% real growth over the current Continuing Resolution (CR). A steady flow of contracts from the Pentagon also provided an impetus to the stocks. Moreover, growing international market for weaponries with several nations increasing their defense spending is also likely to fuel the industry’s growth.Let’s take a look at four defense majors—The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report), General Dynamics Corp.

Notably, the company outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 20.69%.Being the largest aircraft manufacturer and one of the largest aerospace and defense contractors in the United States, Boeing enjoys a solid inflow of contracts from both the Pentagon as well as foreign allies, courtesy its varied product offerings. Markedly, the company received a number of orders for both commercial as well as military jets in the first quarter.Such steady inflow of contract wins will surely boost Boeing’s quarterly sales. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s first-quarter sales is pegged at $22.2 billion, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 5.9%.During its fourth-quarter 2017 earnings call, Boeing announced that higher volumes will drive its bottom line in 2018. Though, the company’s overall deliveries declined, commercial deliveries remained high. With the commercial business constituting almost 60% of Boeing’s total revenues, we expect the unit to drive the company’s first-quarter earnings.Per our proven model, a stock is likely to beat earnings estimate if it has a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold).

981,NOC,"Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 25, before the opening bell.The Defense giant’s Aerospace Systems remains the major growth driver. The company’s first-quarter results are expected to gain from the same.  Lower corporate tax also is likely to boost results.Let’s discuss the factors influencing Northrop Grumman’s quarterly results, in brief.Aerospace Systems — A Key CatalystThe Aerospace Systems segment fetches almost half of Northrop Grumman’s sales and has traditionally been a primary contributor to its top-line growth. The segment’s sales are likely to benefit from increased demand as well as aircraft deliveries. Notably, in the first quarter, the company received a number of contracts for this segment.Among them, the significant ones are the $429-million contract for developing two Extremely High Frequency Data Rate (EHF XDR) payloads and a $255-million contact for low-rate initial production (LRIP) of three MQ-4C Triton. Such contract wins are likely to boost the Aerospace Systems segment’s first-quarter revenues.In line with this, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Aerospace Systems segment stands at $3,131 million, reflecting annual growth of 16.1%.Other Factors to ConsiderThe company’s total sales growth has been historically benefited from higher sales at the Aerospace Systems and Mission Systems segment. We expect the upcoming quarterly result to reflect this trend as well.Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of $2,870 million  reflect an annual increase of 5%,  as the company is expected to continue with its increase in production rates for Sensors and Processing programs.Cumulatively, this is likely to boost the company’s total sales growth for the first quarter. Evidently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues is pegged at $6,583 million, reflecting annual growth of 5.1%.While lower corporate tax on account of the recent tax reform is likely to boost the company’s top line, Northrop Grumman is expected to incur notable expenses in regard to its Orbital ATK acquisition. These two opposite forces may neutralize each other, as a result of which our consensus estimate for the company’s first-quarter earnings of $3.63 per share remained in line with the year-ago quarter’s figure.Further updates on the company’s Orbital ATK acquisition can be expected once it releases first-quarter results.Northrop Grumman Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Northrop Grumman Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Northrop Grumman Corporation QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not show that Northrop Grumman is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Northrop Grumman has an Earnings ESP of -0.99%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Northrop Grumman carries a Zacks Rank #2, which increases the probability of earnings beat. But when combined with a negative earnings ESP, the Zacks Rank #2 makes surprise prediction difficult.Please note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few companies in the Aerospace-Defense space that have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) is expected to report first-quarter results on Apr 25. The company has an Earnings ESP of +1.70% and a Zacks Rank #2.

It has amassed assets over $1.03 B, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Value segment of the US equity market.Why Large Cap ValueLarge cap companies usually have a market capitalization above $10 billion. Considered a more stable option, large cap companies boast more predictable cash flows and are less volatile than their mid and small cap counterparts.Value stocks have lower than average price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios. They also have lower than average sales and earnings growth rates. While value stocks have outperformed growth stocks in nearly all markets when you consider long-term performance, growth stocks are more likely to outpace value stocks in strong bull markets.CostsWhen considering an ETF's total return, expense ratios are an important factor, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts in the long term if all other factors remain equal.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.20%, putting it on par with most peer products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.64%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsWhile ETFs offer diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk, a deep look into a fund's holdings is a valuable exercise. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Information Technology sector--about 22.90% of the portfolio. Industrials and Healthcare round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Northrop Grumman Corp (NOC  -  Free Report) accounts for about 2.45% of total assets, followed by Accenture Plc Class A (ACN  -  Free Report) and Anthem Inc (ANTM  -  Free Report).The top 10 holdings account for about 20.04% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskLRGF seeks to match the performance of the MSCI USA Diversified Multiple-Factor Index before fees and expenses. The MSCI USA Diversified Multiple-Factor Index is composed of U.S. large and mid-capitalization stocks that have favourable exposure to target style factors subject to constraints.The ETF has added about 2.33% so far this year and was up about 18.49% in the last one year (as of 04/18/2018). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $27.71 and $33.90.The ETF has a beta of 0.93 and standard deviation of 13.33% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 150 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesIShares Edge MSCI Multifactor USA ETF holds a Zacks ETF Rank of 2 (Buy), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Because of this, LRGF is a great option for investors seeking exposure to the Large Cap ETFs segment of the market. There are other additional ETFs in the space that investors could consider as well.The Vanguard Value ETF (VTV  -  Free Report) and the iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF (IWD  -  Free Report) track a similar index. While Vanguard Value ETF has $36.29 B in assets, iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF has $36.60 B.

983,NOC,"The United States along with its French and UK allies launched a series of airstrikes on Syria over the last weekend. 105 missiles were fired on three facilities involved in research or storage of chemical weapons in western Syria. On Apr 7, Duma was a witness to a chemical attack which claimed several lives. The recent attack is believed to be a response to the same. The world once again witnessed fresh tension following which U.S. defense stocks gained substantially as majority of the weapons used in the strike were provided by them.Russia’s StanceRussia strongly condemned the latest U.S.-led airstrikes and repudiated America’s claim that Russian president Vladimir Putin supported Syrian leader Assad in the chemical attack. Russia’s ambassador to the United States warned that the country will handle the issue with firm hands and the defamation of the Russian president will be dealt with.Criticizing the latest attack as an ""act of aggression"", Putin warned that further strikes from Western countries on Syria will have implications on global affairs.Will Russia Strike Back?Though Russia strongly condemned the Syrian attack, majority of experts believe that Russia will not engage in any direct conflict with the United States, at least in the near term.  Per a report by CNBC one analyst said ""likelihood of a direct, military response to the strikes from Russia is very low.""Despite the Russian ambassador’s repeated threats of the nation targeting and destroying the platforms from which the missiles were fired, Moscow is fully aware that such attacks will bring Russia in a direct face-to-face conflict with the United States. Thus a Russian retaliation is unlikely in the near term.Economic Sanctions to Play a Role?Recently rounds were made that the United States intends to levy new economic sanctions on Russia for its apparent support of the Syrian leader Assad.  In particular, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley announced on Apr 15 that the United States will put new economic sanctions on companies ""dealing with equipment"" used in Assad’s alleged chemical attack.However, President Trump, in a recent meet, dismissed possibilities of imposing new sanctions on Russia in the near term. Should the move come, it will further strain the relationship between these two nations. Notably, relations between the United States and Russia have failed to remain genial after the Trump administration imposed sanctions on several Russian tycoons close to Putin, earlier this month, due to their involvement in the 2016 election.In the near future, it is expected that by imposing stringent economic sanctions Trump will try to keep Russia under pressure and also ensure that the nation abstains from involving in its Syrian affairs.Defense Stocks to Gain From the Conflict: Here’s Why Historical data shows that shares of U.S. defense majors have spiked whenever the United States has engaged in military activities. Of the 105 missiles fired at Syria, 19 were JASSMs manufactured by Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT  -  Free Report) and 66 were Tomahawk cruise missiles made by Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report). Evidently, their shares gained more than 0.5% in the past couple of trading sessions. Stocks to Place Bet OnIf Russia ultimately decides to retaliate, the fresh conflict will provide a solid boost to U.S. defense stocks. Therefore, adding defense stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and strong financials to your portfolio will be a prudent move.The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) is the largest aircraft manufacturer in the world in terms of revenues, orders and deliveries, and one of the largest aerospace and defense contractors.

984,NOC,"The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) recently won a contract for providing long-lead non-recurring engineering to develop a baseline configuration for the production and delivery of 22 F/A-18E and 6 F/A-18F Super Hornets. These services will be rendered to the government of Kuwait.Details of the DealValued at $1.2 billion, the contract was awarded by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, Maryland. Per the terms, Boeing will offer long-lead radar warning receivers and aircraft armament equipment. The deal is expected to be completed by September 2022.Majority of the work will be executed in Hazelwood, MI; Goleta and EL Segundo,CA; while the remaining portion will be carried out in different parts across the United States. Foreign military sales funds will be utilized to partially finance the task.A Brief Note on F/A-18E/FBoeing’s F/A-18 Block III Super Hornet is a twin-engine, supersonic, all weather multirole fighter jet. The U.S. Navy’s tactical and air superiority aircraft is capable of performing virtually every mission in the tactical spectrum, including air superiority, day/night strike with precision-guided weapons, fighter escort, close air support, suppression of enemy air defenses, maritime strike, reconnaissance, forward air control and tanker missions.The F/A-18E and F/A-18/F are two varieties of the F/A-18 family of military jets.Boeing believes that the Super Hornet is the most cost-effective aircraft in the U.S. tactical aviation fleet, costing less per flight hour than any other tactical aircraft in U.S. forces inventory.What’s Favoring Boeing?Boeing is one of the major players in the defense business and stands out among its peers by virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and solid backlog. With aeroplanes being its flagship product, the company has been witnessing strong demand for its fighter aircraft and major aerospace programs, including the F/A-18 jets.Evidently, the Fiscal 2018 budget required 80 Super Hornets over the next five years as part of the Future Years Defense Program, including funding for Research Development, Test & Evaluation for Block III capabilities.  Moreover, the U.S. Navy added an additional 10 Super Hornets into the FY18 budget as its No. 1 unfunded priority.Meanwhile, in February 2018, President Trump proposed fiscal 2019 defense budget that provisions for major war fighting investments of $21.7 billion for aircrafts. Boeing, being the largest aircraft manufacturer in the United States, will surely be a significant beneficiary once this budget gets Senate’s approval, which also includes an investment plan of $2 billion for procuring 24 F/A-18 aircrafts. Surely these developments, along with the latest contract win, will provide impetus to Boeing’s defense segment’s growth, which generated  revenues worth $5.54 billion, in the last reported quarter.Price MovementBoeing’s stock has rallied about 85.6 % in a year, compared with the broader industry’s gain of 46.7%. The outperformance was primarily led by significant demand for its military jets along with robust worldwide demand for its commercial aircraft.  Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to Consider    Boeing currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).A few other top-ranked stocks in the same sector are Huntington Ingalls (HII  -  Free Report), Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report) and Wesco Aircraft Holdings (WAIR  -  Free Report).

985,NOC,"Orbital ATK  announced that it received an order from Intelsat to build the Galaxy 30 communications satellite. This order continues the long business partnership of these two companies, as Galaxy 30 will be the 11th satellite to be built by Orbital ATK for Intelsat.The Galaxy 30 satellite will be based on Orbital ATK’s highly successful GEOStar-2™ satellite platform. It will be made and tested at Orbital ATK’s satellite manufacturing facility in Dulles, VA, and will primarily serve video markets in North America. The satellite is scheduled for launch in early 2020.Leader in Communication SatellitesOrbital ATK is among the world’s leading suppliers of communication satellites. Galaxy 30 will be the 41st commercial spacecraft to be manufactured by it for customers around the world.Orbital ATK’s GEOStar-2 spacecraft platform — the 1.5-5.5 kilowatt (kW) commercial geosynchronous (GEO) communications satellites — provides direct-to-home TV broadcasting, cable program distribution, business data network capacity, regional mobile communications and similar services.Orbital ATK has extended power and payload capabilities of GEOStar-2 satellites with its new GEOStar-3 satellites, which can provide up to 8.0 kW of payload power and can accommodate virtually all types of commercial communications payloads.Demand for Satellites The communication boom, investment by the governments across the globe in the geospatial industry and use of satellite imaging in various other industries has been helpful in pushing up the demand for satellites.Ongoing research and development activities and use of new technology are making satellites extremely efficient. The Defense sector is one of the major customers for satellites.Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT  -  Free Report) and The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) are some of the other important suppliers in the global satellite market. Acquisition of Orbital ATK by Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report) will expand the latter’s presence in this promising communication satellite space.Price MovementShares of Orbital ATK have returned 48.9% in the last 12 months, significantly outperforming the Zacks Aerospace and Defense Equipment industry’s rally of 30.7%. The strong performance of the company can be attributed to its diverse product offering and ability to win contracts at regular interval from its wide customer base.Zacks RankOrbital ATK currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

986,NOC,"General Dynamics Corporation’s (GD  -  Free Report) business unit, Land Systems, recently secured a $68.6 million modification contract to upgrade Stryker flat-bottom vehicles to the patented double V-hull design. The contract was awarded by the U.S. Army Contracting Command, Warren, MI.Work related to the deal will be performed in Sterling Heights, MI, and is expected to get completed in Mar 31, 2020. General Dynamics will utilize fiscal 2017 Army procurement of weapons and tracked combat vehicles’ funds for completing the task.Benefits of the Stryker Land VehicleThe eight-wheeled, armored combat vehicle is powered by a 350 horsepower Caterpillar JP-8 diesel engine that provides the U.S. Army with an effective mix of capabilities, including infantry transport, offensive firepower and reconnaissance. The Stryker's other capabilities include the anti-tank guided missiles, mobile C4ISR, engineering and fire support, mobile gun system, and medical evacuation.Prone to devastating IED attacks in Afghanistan, the vehicle was outfitted with a new double-V hull. Such improvements in the design led to staggering improvements in soldier survivability, providing protection in open terrain areas.Our ViewWith widespread geo-political tension around the globe, many nations are strengthening their arsenals and taking initiatives to upgrade land-combat military vehicles. This, in turn, should boost General Dynamics’ growth, with the company being one of the major players in the wheeled military vehicle market.Notably, General Dynamics' Combat Systems segment that manufactures wheeled combat vehicles registered $1.44 billion of sales in the first quarter of 2018, reflecting 11.9% year-over-year growth. We may expect General Dynamics to witness similar strong results in this segment in upcoming quarters, buoyed by strong demand for its combat-proven war vehicles that eventually led to the latest contract win. This, in turn, should expand the company’s profit margin.Furthermore, the fiscal 2019 defense budget, recently approved by the U.S. Senate, provisions for a spending plan of $5.8 billion on Ground Systems. Such robust budgetary allotments should aid General Dynamics in acquiring major contracts from the Pentagon, related to its wheeled combat and tactical vehicles.Price Movement    General Dynamics’s stock has lost 4.9% in the last year compared with its industry’s growth of 31.4%. The underperformance may have been caused by the intense competition that the company faces in the aerospace-defense space.Zacks Rank & Key Picks    General Dynamics currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A few better-ranked stocks in the same space are Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC  -  Free Report), Textron Inc. (TXT  -  Free Report) and Wesco Aircraft Holdings, Inc.

987,NOC,"Per major media sources, The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) recently secured a $6.6 billion contract for delivering 24 cargo aircraft to FedEx Express, which is a subsidiary of Tennessee-based FedEx courier delivery services company. Per the terms, FedEx has ordered 12 of Boeing’s 767 freighter aircraft and 12 of the twin aisle large-sized 777 cargo aircraft.With the latest deal inked, Boeing has further strengthened its relationship with FedEx, one of its major cargo customers for nearly 41 years now. Notably, FedEx is currently the largest customer for both 767 and 777 cargo aircraft models of Boeing. FedEx also owns Boeing’s 777F EcoDemonstrator that provides clear air-turbulence detection and ground-collision avoidance, and flies on 100% biofuel to reduce carbon emissions.A Brief Note on 767 and 777 FreightersBoeing's 767 Freighter is a mid to large size, wide-body twin-engine jet airliner, which is capable of carrying approximately 52 tons of cargo with intercontinental range. Its advanced fuel-efficient 767-300 converted freighter comes with advanced avionics, aerodynamics, materials and propulsion systems.On the other hand, the 777 Freighter is long-range, wide-body, twin-engine jet airliner that can fly 4,900 nautical miles with a full payload. It features an advanced maneuver load alleviation system that redistributes the aero­dynamic load on the wing, during non-normal flight conditions.Our ViewOver the past two years, there has been a solid recovery in the air cargo market, driven by the rising e-commerce demand and strong trade which has boosted the global air freight businesses. Evidently, air freight demand is expected to increase 4.5% in 2018, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA). Given the solid growth prospects for this space, contracts like the latest one is likely to boost Boeing's top line from freighter aircraft.Boeing has witnessed a successful year so far from the perspective of its wide-body freighters. In February 2018, the company received a delivery order for 18 747-8 freighters along with four 767 freighters to UPS. Moreover, Amazon acquired 40 used 767 freighter jets for its Amazon Air service, according to The Seattle Times.Boeing has posted sales of more than 50 wide-body freighters this year compared to 11 sold in 2017, courtesy of the latest order placed by FedEx. This reflects the solid demand that exists for Boeing’s freighter aircraft. This must have prompted Boeing to increase the annual output of its 767 by 20% to 36 planes by 2020, as announced in May 2018.Boeing Commercial Airplanes Segment, which develops and markets commercial jet aircrafts, including the 767, 777 and 747 freighter jets, witnessed a solid 5% sales improvement in first-quarter 2018. We expect Boeing to reflect similar strong results in this segment going ahead, which in turn are is likely to boost the company’s profit margin.Price MovementBoeing’s stock rallied about 78.8% in a year compared with the industry’s growth of 30.4%. The outperformance was primarily led by the robust worldwide demand for its commercial aircraft and military jets.Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to ConsiderBoeing currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

988,NOC,"Bell-Boeing, a joint venture (JV) between The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) and Bell Helicopter — a unit of Textron Inc. (TXT  -  Free Report) — recently secured a modification contract in relation to V-22 aircraft. Per the terms, the JV will convert the V-22 tiltrotor aircraft advance acquisition contract to a multiyear contract.Details of the DealValued at $4.2 billion, the contract was awarded by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD. Per the agreement, the JV will involve in the manufacture and delivery of 39 CMV-22B aircraft for the U.S. Navy; 34 MV-22B aircraft for U.S. Marine Corps; 1 CV-22B for the U. S. Air Force; and 4 MV-22B aircraft for the government of Japan.The majority of the work will be executed in Fort Worth and Amarillo, TX; and Ridley Park, PA; while the rest will be carried out in various locations within continental and outside continental United States.  The JV will utilize fiscal 2017 aircraft procurement (Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps); and fiscal 2018 aircraft procurement (Navy) fund to complete the task by November 2024. This modification includes 67.9% of the work for the U.S. Navy; 24.8% for U.S. Marine Corps, 1.8% for the U.S. Air Force; and 5.5% for the government of Japan under the Foreign Military Sales program. A Brief Note on V-22 JetsBell-Boeing’s primary product, V-22 Osprey, is a multi-mission, tiltrotor military aircraft with both vertical as well as short takeoff and landing capabilities. It is designed to combine the functionality of a conventional helicopter with the long-range, high-speed cruise performance of a turboprop aircraft. This military aircraft has the capacity to carry 24 combat troops or up to 20,000 pounds of internal cargo or 15,000 pounds of external cargo. The CMV-22B, MV-22B and CV-2B are different variants of the V-22 Osprey.The V-22 tiltrotor has been deployed in numerous missions around the world, including casualty evacuation, tactical recovery of aircraft and personnel, humanitarian assistance/disaster relief, resupply, VIP transport and theater security cooperation.Our ViewA rapid increase in terror attacks along with the widespread rise of ISIS has compelled nations to strengthen arsenal and bump up defense budget. The present U.S. administration is also in favor of raising defense spending in contrast to the budget sequestration enacted by the prior government.The recently approved fiscal 2019 defense budget worth $716 billion further supports this fact. Thus, it is obvious that defense majors like Boeing and Textron will receive an increased flow of contracts from the Pentagon for their high-end defense equipment. In fact, the latest contract win by Bell-Boeing mirrors the same. Such contract inflows, in turn, should further drive these two defense contractors’ performance, thereby boosting their respective profit margins.Price MovementIn a year’s time, Boeing’s shares have soared about 68.9%, outperforming the broader industry’s rally of 29.2%. This impressive performance was driven by the company’s record backlog supporting revenue growth, increased orders for commercial airplanes and expanded presence in domestic as well as international markets.Meanwhile, Textron’s shares have gained around 38.1% in a year, ahead of the industry’s rally. This upside can be attributed to the company’s strong order growth along with its systematic inorganic growth strategy.Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to Consider     Both Boeing and Textron currently carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Some other top-ranked stocks in the same space include Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report) and Wesco Aircraft Holdings (WAIR  -  Free Report).

990,NOC,"Orbital ATK  announced that it has successfully clinched the first full-rate production (FRP) contract for its all-electronic FMU-167/B Hard Target Void Sensing Fuze (HTVSF).The $23 million award has been contracted through the U.S. Air Force, and is a follow-on FRP order to the low-rate initial production contract in 2016.What is HTVSF?Orbital ATK developed the all-electronic FMU-167/B, recognizing the need to fulfill a specialized and growing demand for penetrating weapons. As such, the HTVSF is an advanced technology with an intelligent, cockpit programmable fuze capable of destroying hard and deeply buried targets.It is capable of such an action with the help of advanced sensors, robust algorithms and hardened electronics technology that aid in improved performance against tactical targets. It provides multiple delay arming and detonation times, as well as a void-sensing function, which also allows precision activation of the fuze.Orbital ATK’s Contracts & R&DOrbital ATK currently boasts of over 100 major development and production programs that assure a steady revenue stream and inflow of new contracts. In the third quarter, the company invested $70 million in R&D and capital equipment. Notably, such continual investments will certainly help the company to come out with new products and upgrade existing ones to meet growing demand.Thanks to the company’s diverse product offering, it continues to win several contracts from its wide customer base. In third-quarter 2017, the company received $1,435 million in new firm and option orders. As of Sep 30, 2017 Orbital ATK’s total backlog was nearly $15.7 billion (up 3% year over year), out of which, firm backlog was $9.6 billion (up 5% year over year).Per managements opinion, yields from the conclusion of the aforementioned FRPcontract will help the company to progress further on building what they believe is a key capability for armed forces and allies.Our OpinionWidespread geo-political and socio-economic tensions have been bolstering growth of the aerospace and defense industry for decades now. In recent times, escalating international terrorist attacks and emergence of civil wars like those in the Middle East have been adding more impetus to the space. Impressively, stocks in the Zacks Aerospace sector (a stand-alone sector) have rallied 36.7% in the last 12 months, significantly outperforming the S&P 500’s 19.3% gain.With a majority of macroeconomic factors favoring this sector, such outperformance can be expected to continue in the coming days. Further, given the increase in cyber attacks, terror threats and geopolitical instability, there is a pressing need to boost security and defense by all countries.Notably, major defense contractors in the nation like Orbital, AeroVironment, Inc. (AVAV  -  Free Report), and Rockwell Collins, Inc. (COL  -  Free Report) are also trying their best to make the most of this opportunity and expand worldwide.Further, Orbital ATK has entered in an agreement to be acquired by Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report) for a sum of $9.2 billion. This deal was announced in September 2017 and is expected to close in the first half of 2018.Price PerformanceOrbital ATK’s stock has returned 47.7% in a year, outperforming the 30.4% rally of the industry it belongs to.Zacks RankOrbital ATK carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

992,NOC,"On May 23, we issued an updated research report on Orbital ATK, Inc. . The company continues to gain from its wide range of high-quality products and consistent flow of orders. Orbital ATK reported first-quarter 2018 earnings of $1.76 per share beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.50 by 17.3%. Total revenues were $1,312 million, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,134 million by 15.69%. Higher sales volumes from all three segments boosted its performance.However, intense competition in the space and fluctuations in currencies are deterrents.In a year’s time, Orbital ATK stock has gained 32.9% outperforming the 29.9% rally of its industry.What’s Driving Orbital ATK?Higher backlog is expected to drive the company’s performance. The new orders have boosted the company’s year-over-year contract backlog by 14% to $9.4 billion and total backlog by 12% to $16.6 billion.The company continues to win a steady stream of contracts from its wide customer base, courtesy of a diverse product offering. Company’s total sales were divided among U.S. Government deals accounting for 75% and commercial & foreign customers accounting for 25%. Mix of domestic and foreign customers gives more stability to revenues and compensate for declines in orders in any particular area.In the quarter, the company invested nearly $100 million for research & development activities and capital equipment. During the first quarter, Flight Systems conducted its fifth IRBM target launch from a C-17 aircraft and completed OmegA next-generation large-class launch vehicle. For commercial operators, Space Systems introduced its second-generation in-space satellite servicing technology.However, defense is a highly competitive sector and Orbital ATK is required to offer high-quality products and services to retain and gain customers. In addition, foreign currency fluctuation and delay in supply in raw materials required by the company to fulfil orders could affect operations.Acquisition NewsOrbital ATK will be acquired by Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report) for $9.2 billion. Of the total amount, Northrop will pay approximately $7.8 billion in cash and the assumption of $1.4 billion in net debt. The companies expect the transaction to be closed by the first half of 2018. Post the announcement of this news, the shares of Orbital ATK have rallied significantly and presently trading near the acquisition price.Rockwell Collins, Inc. (COL  -  Free Report), another prominent operator in the same space, will be acquired by United Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report). The transactions are expected close by the third quarter of 2018.Zacks RankOrbital ATK has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

993,NOC,"Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report) announced that its board of directors has approved a 9% hike in its quarterly common stock dividend. This has taken the annualized payout to $4.80 per share.The new quarterly dividend of $1.20 per share is up by a dime from the earlier quarterly dividend. The hiked dividend will be paid on Jun 20, 2018 to shareholders of record at the close of business on Jun 4.The board of directors of Northrop Grumman Corporation has been clearing annual dividend hikes for more than a decade now. We note that yearly payout increases are becoming a regular event for this defense major. The current dividend revision marked the 16th consecutive annual dividend raise by the company.The current annualized dividend yield is 1.50% compared with the industry average of 0.91%. This rise in distributable income vouches for the company’s strong balance sheet and a steady cash flow position, which provides it with financial flexibility and a cushion for incremental dividend.Can Northrop Sustain Dividend Hikes?Northrop has inked a deal to take over rocket-maker Orbital ATK  for $9.2 billion in 2017 and the transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2018. This acquisition will likely boost Northrop’s product portfolio as Orbital ATK has contracts with NASA and the U.S. Army. The consolidation will be accretive to Northrop’s earnings per share and its free cash flow in 2018. Further, the acquisition might lead to annual cost savings of nearly $150 million by 2020.Defense being a capital-intensive sector, business investment remains Northrop’s first priority. The company continues to anticipate free cash flow of $2-$2.3 billion after capital spending of approximately $1 billion in 2018.The company is committed to deliver higher returns to its shareholders by way of greater dividend payouts and efficient share repurchase strategy. We believe that the company’s strong cash flow and organic growth will help generate sufficient funds to meet its financial commitments.Dividend Hikes in the Same SpaceNorthrop Grumman is not the only company to reward its shareholders with increased dividend. There are also other players in the same industry to add shareholder value.For instance, General Dynamic Corporation (GD  -  Free Report) announced a quarterly dividend of 93 cents per share on Mar 7, 2018, registering a raise of 10.7% compared with the dividend amount paid in the previous quarter.The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) also approved a quarterly dividend of $1.71 per share on Dec11, 2017, delivering a 20% hike compared with the dividend paid in the previous quarter.Price MovementNorthrop Grumman Corporation’s stock has rallied about 31.2% in the past year, underperforming Zacks Aerospace/Defense industry’s gain of 42.5%. Zacks RankNorthrop Grumman Corporation currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

995,NOC,"The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) announced that it has secured a $23.3 million contract from the U.S. Air Force for providing support services to the Minuteman III weapon system. Per the contract, the company will provide operations and maintenance, testing and technical data delivery support to the Minuteman III.Work related to the contract will be carried out at the Little Mountain Test Facility situated in Ogden, UT. Operations are expected to be concluded by Sep 30, 2023.About Minuteman III weapon systemBoeing has been one of the primary integrator for the Minuteman Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) system since 1958. So far, the company has created, tested and deployed more than 1,800 Minuteman-series missiles for the Air Force.Since its inception in 1958, there have been a number of upgrades to the Minuteman III weapon system. The Minuteman system has been developed to meet new challenges and undertake new missions. The latest version – Minuteman III – is a part of the U.S. Strategic Command.Strong BacklogBoeing has earned the position of one of the largest aerospace and defense contractors in the world in terms of revenue, orders and deliveries. It is a competitor to industry giants like Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report), Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT  -  Free Report) and Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc (HII  -  Free Report) etc. The company receives regular orders from the Department of Defense (DoD).Backlog at the end of the second quarter was up to $482.2 billion from $479.5 billion at the end of first quarter. Reported backlog included $27 billion of net orders during the quarter.During the quarter, the company won a massive $1.1 billion, from the Missile Defense Agency (“MDA”) to procure Redesigned Kill Vehicle (“RKV”) development among all the other ones.Defense Scenario Helping in GrowthRecently, the U.S. Senate passed fiscal 2018 defense policy bill worth $700 billion, which was proposed in July 2017. This bill provides about $640 billion for Pentagon’s main operations like buying weapons and paying the troops. The rest $60 billion for Overseas Contingency Operations will be utilized to fund the conflicts in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and elsewhere. Not just the United States, majority of nations in the world who are fighting against internal and external enemies are working hard to strengthen their defense system.All the above reasons put together will help Boeing and its peers in securing more contracts from different verticals of U.S. Defense and also from other allies of the United States.Price MovementShares of Boeing have rallied 93.7% over the last 12 months, outperforming the industry’s gain of 43.0%.This outperformance could be attributed to the company’s strong balance sheet and cash flows which have been providing financial flexibility in matters of incremental dividend, ongoing share repurchases and earnings accretive acquisitions.Zacks RankBoeing currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1002,NOC,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 6.8% over the past month. RTN hit a new 52-week high of $225.86 in the previous session. Raytheon has gained 19.8% since the start of the year compared to the 10.2% move for the Aerospace sector and the 9.5% year-to-date return for its peer group.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on January 25, 2018, Raytheon reported EPS of $2.03 versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.02 while it missed the consensus revenue estimate by 0.74%.For the current fiscal year, Raytheon is expected to post earnings of $9.69 per share on $26.71 billion in revenues. This represents a 27.17% change in EPS on a 5.38% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $11.09 per share on $27.89 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 14.45% and 4.41%, respectively.Valuation MetricsWhile RTN has moved to its 52-week high in the recent past, investors need to be asking, what is next for the company? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Raytheon has a Value Score of C. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are B and A, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 23.2X current fiscal year EPS estimates. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 23.5X versus its peer group's average of 15.4X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 2.12. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Raytheon Company Price and Consensus  Raytheon Company Price and Consensus | Raytheon Company QuoteZacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Raytheon Company currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Raytheon meets the list of requirements. Thus, it seems as though RTN shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come.How Does Raytheon Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of Raytheon have been rising, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? Some of its industry peers are also solid potential picks, including Curtiss-Wright Corporation (CW  -  Free Report), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report), and The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report), all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least #2 and a VGM Score of at least B, making them well-rounded choices.The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 45% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for RTN, even beyond its own solid fundamental situation.

On Apr 14, Trump declared that the strikes were a success, tweeting “Mission Accomplished.”Meanwhile, Russia expressed anger over the U.S.-led missile strike on Syria. And on Sunday, the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations said the United States is likely to impose new sanctions against Russia because it continues to back President Assad’s regime. With recent missile strikes likely to snowball into an extended conflict, it makes sense to stock up on defense stocks.    “Mission Accomplished,” Says TrumpTrump’s order for a missile strike on Syria was a marked departure from his initial stance on the issue. As late as last week, Trump had said that he was in favor of U.S. forces withdrawing from Syria. But the situation changed drastically after Apr 7 with the President tweeting that missile strikes were likely forthcoming.On Apr 14, Trump said the missile strikes were “perfectly executed” and had accomplished their objective. Defense Secretary James Mattis also characterized the strikes as a “one time shot.” But Trump also said the United States was “prepared to sustain this response until the Syrian regime stops its use of prohibited chemical agents.""Russia Warns of “Consequences”, U.S. Sanctions LikelyRussia has expressed its displeasure over the U.S. led joint strike with its ambassador to the United States Anatoly Antonov saying that his country’s “worst apprehensions have come true. Antonov’s statement, released on Twitter also warned that unspecified “consequences” were likely to follow.Comments from U.S Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley on Sunday raised chances of an escalation even further. Speaking on CBS’s “Face the Nation,” Haley said U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin would announce fresh sanctions against Russia on Monday. These sanctions would be targeted at “companies that were dealing with equipment related to Assad and chemical weapons use.”Defense Stocks Benefit From Middle-East ConflictTogether, the United States, Russia and France launched 105 missiles on targets in Syria. Of these, 19 were JASSMs manufactured by Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT  -  Free Report) and 66 were Tomahawk cruise missiles made by Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report). On Wednesday, shares of both these companies gained almost 1% after Trump said Russia should “get ready” for a missile attack on Syria.Meanwhile, historical data shows that U.S. defense stocks tend to outperform the broader market when the United States engages in a military offensive in the Middle-East. CNBC Analysis using Kensho shows that the S&P 500 aerospace sub-industry gained 1.5% a month after such an offensive. Over the same period, the Dow and the S&P 500 gained less than 1%. On Apr 11, the iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF (ITA) gained 0.5% even as the S&P 500 lost 0.3%.Our ChoicesThough the Pentagon believes that the current offensive has been concluded, signs are rife that it may have only served to escalate tensions. Russia has issued strong protests against the assault and with the United States preparing to issue fresh economic sanctions, the conflict in Syria is far from over.Also, historical data shows that U.S. defense stocks gain after a military offensive in the Middle East.

1006,NOC,"“A well-diversified portfolio needs just four stocks,” believes billionaire investor Charlie Munger. Going by his words, we bring to you four stocks from top-ranked Zacks sectors to make the most of this earnings season.  But why choose stocks from four different sectors? In a volatile market, portfolio diversification is the key to mitigate risks of overexposure to one sector. Currently, markets are suffering from heavy bouts of volatility as investors apprehend a trade war from the bitter exchanges between the Unites States and China over tariffs and also from the recent chemical bomb attack on Syria. In the wake of this, diversification can be considered an ideal way to safeguard one’s portfolio from market upheavals.Sectors in SpotlightThe Industrial Products, Basic Materials, Construction and Aerospace sectors are ranked as the top four, out of 16, based on our in-house classifications. Over the last 10 years, using a one-week rebalance, the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than two. (Learn more: About About Zacks Sector Rank).Further, per the latest Earnings Trends, earnings and revenues from these sectors are expected to surge in the first quarter, which makes it a good idea to pick stocks from these sectors which are also likely to outperform earnings estimates. But before that, let’s take a closer look at these sectors to find out what has been working in favor of them.Industrial Products (1 out of 16) Expected Earnings Growth Rate in Q1 — 24.1%Expected Revenue Growth Rate — 12.5%Rise in industrial production data indicates that manufacturing activity remains strong. Tax cuts and strong economic conditions have provided a firm basis for manufacturing activity. With the Purchasing Managers' Index touching 50.9% in March, the manufacturing space looks in good shape. A reading of 50 or higher signals at a thriving manufacturing industry in the United States.Basic Materials (2 out of 16)Expected Earnings Growth Rate in Q1 — 41.3%Expected Revenue Growth Rate — 20.3%Sustained growth, stronger inflation and government policies have worked in favor of the sector to a large extent. The U.S. government’s decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum is likely to provide a short-term boost to basic materials. Also, with Trump’s $1.5-trillion infrastructure plan in place, basic materials prices are likely to receive a boost.Construction (3 out of 16)Expected Earnings Growth Rate in Q1 — 35.4%Expected Revenue Growth Rate — 15.8%Construction sector is in fine fettle buoyed by robust gains from home building investments, strong economic growth and recent tax reforms. Moreover, government project spend is expected to increase in 2018, with the Trump Administration’s $1.5-trillion infrastructure plan in place. As per the study by Dodge Data & Analytics, public works construction is expected rise 3% in 2018.Aerospace (4 out of 16)Expected Earnings Growth Rate in Q1 — 13.4%Expected Revenue Growth Rate — 3.6%Increasing budget allocations in America -- in view of escalating geopolitical tensions worldwide -- have been boosting the stocks in this space along with a steady improvement in air traffic that has substantially driven commercial airplane demand. Moreover, advent of innovative technologies in warfare and their increased application as well as higher demand for cost-efficient production are driving revenues in the U.S. Aerospace and Defense industry.How to Pick the Winners for the Season?Selecting an S&P 500 stock from each top-ranked sector should be the first step. But why S&P 500 stocks? Because such stocks are usually expected to report impressive earnings results, courtesy of their strong balance sheet and solid cash flow.Total Q1 earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to be up 16% in the first quarter of 2018 from the same period last year on 7.4% higher revenues, the highest quarterly earnings growth in seven years. Meanwhile, 24 S&P 500 companies have already reported their quarterly results this season with earnings up 39.3% from the prior-year quarter on 11.7% higher revenues, with 75% beating earnings estimates and 70.8% surpassing the revenue mark.Also, we have ensured that the selected stocks possess a favorable combination of Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) with a positive Earnings ESP.

1009,NOC,"Military shipbuilder Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc.’s (HII  -  Free Report) business unit, Newport News Shipbuilding, recently secured a contract for conducting engineered overhaul of fiscal 2019 USS Boise (SSN 764), from the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C. Work related to this deal is scheduled to be over by February 2021.Details of the DealValued at $59.8 million, this assignment will be carried out at the company’s shipbuilding yard located at Newport News, VA. Notably this contract has a potential to reach a cumulative value of $385.7 million, if on exercise of options included in this deal.Per the terms of the agreement, Huntington Ingalls will be engaged in planning and execution of the overhaul process. Fiscal 2018 other procurement (Navy) funds will be utilized to complete the task.A Brief Note on USS BoiseUSS Boise (SSN 764) is a Los Angeles-class nuclear-powered fast attack submarine. Notably, the Los Angeles-class forms the backbone of the U.S. Navy's submarine force.Nuclear Submarines & the United StatesTo counter the rising geopolitical tensions across the world, the U.S. government has been designing submarines for decades. Notably, the modern-day nuclear-powered submarines are markedly better than the diesel-engine ones that had to make multiple stops for refueling.In the United States, the market for nuclear submarine is a consolidated one, operated by two prime players — Huntington Ingalls and General Dynamics Corporation (GD  -  Free Report). As a result both companies enjoy a large share of the market as well as high profit margins.It is imperative to mention in this context that recently the U.S. administration has been allotting significant provision for nuclear submarines in the nation’s defense budget, thereby encouraging submarine-manufacturers like Huntington Ingalls in boosting production. Evidently, the fiscal 2017 budget proposal allocated $8.1 billion for submarines.How Will the Deal Benefit Huntington?Huntington’s Newport News division enjoys one of the leading positions in the designing and building nuclear-powered submarines for the U.S. Navy. As of December 2016, Newport News delivered 59 submarines to the U.S. Navy which comprised 45 fast attack and 14 ballistic missile submarines. Moreover, of the 52 nuclear-powered fast attack submarines currently in active service, 25 were delivered by Newport News.The global submarine market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5% and to reach a value of $27.6 billion from 2016 to 2021, as forecasted by Technavio market research analysts. Considering this and the aforementioned developments, we can expect Huntington Ingalls to win more such submarine-related contracts going ahead, thereby boosting its profit margin.Price PerformanceShares of Huntington have rallied 47.9% over a year, outperforming the industry’s 45.3% gain. The company is the sole designer and manufacturer of nuclear powered aircraft carriers in the U.S. Over 70% of the active U.S. Navy fleet consists of Huntington Ingalls ships and the company continues to enjoy strong order growth from the U.S. Navy. This in turn may have led to the company’s aforementioned outperformance.  Zacks Rank and Other Stocks to ConsiderHuntington Ingalls currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).A few other top-ranked stocks in the aerospace-defense space are The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report), both of which carry a Zacks Rank #2.

The company has a solid long-term growth earnings growth of 13%.Northrop Grumman surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last four quarters with an average of 12.60%.

1012,NOC,"The aerospace and defense sector has been on a rally since last year. This has primarily been due to President Donald Trump’s push to boost defense spending in the United States. Further, a steep reduction in corporate taxes late last year will prove to be instrumental in bolstering growth for the sector in 2018.Also, Trump’s fiscal 2019 budget plan beefs up spending on defense and military research by as much as $470 billion over the next two years. Under such circumstances, the space is poised to breach boundaries in 2018 as the momentum that the segment picked up in last one year will continue.Defense Rally to Continue The space has seen splendid growth over the last one year. This is evident from the rise that the three broader ETFs tracking the sector has experienced in a year. The iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF ITA, the SPDR S&P Aerospace & Defense ETF XAR and PowerShares Aerospace & Defense PPA have all surged 34.9%, 31.3% and 31.9%, respectively. Notably, all these ETFs have surpassed the S&P 500’s (.INX) performance in the same period where the broader index climbed 17.4%.Coming to the top players in the industry, we find a similar trend of growth with each of the stocks individually surpassing the S&P 500’s performance in a year’s time. Shares of Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report), Orbital ATK, Inc. , General Dynamics Corporation (GD  -  Free Report), Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT  -  Free Report), Rockwell Collins, Inc. (COL  -  Free Report) and United Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report) have gained 43.2%, 45%, 43.6%, 19.6%, 34.9%, 46% and 20.4%, respectively. Both the companies possess a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Trump’s Defense Budget ProposalThere’s no denying the fact that Trump’s presidency has come as a boon for the U.S. defense space, which was grappling with the budget sequestration act implemented by the prior government. While the fiscal 2018 (FY18) defense budget reflecting a noble 10% hike from the FY16 level was a major forerunner for this sector’s growth at the beginning of 2017, the FY18 defense policy bill worth $700 billion that extensively surpassed Trump's budget request took stocks to new heights in the second half of the year.On Feb 12, the Pentagon unveiled its fiscal 2019 budget proposal outlined by the President, in a bid to rebuild the U.S. military into a more agile and lethal force globally. Notably, the budget proposal aims at spending $716 billion on national security.Of the total, $686.1 billion has been reserved as funding for the Pentagon, reflecting 5% real growth over the initial FY18 President’s budget and 10% real growth over the current Continuing Resolution (CR). The budget includes $617.1 billion as base budget, highlighting a 17.8% increase from the 2018 current CR level, and $69 billion for Overseas Contingency Operations.Moreover, in the wake of North Korea’s ballistic missile threats, the budget proposal includes an investment plan of $6 billion for varied missile programs. The budget requests for increased investment worth $10.5 billion on facilities, reflecting a 7% rise over the fiscal 2018 base budget request. The funds will be used for fortifying military infrastructure to increase force lethality and minimize the cost of maintaining unneeded capacity.More Mergers & Acquisitions in PipelineIn the second half of 2017, we have seen a wave of mergers between big aerospace and defense companies in a bid to fend off competition, restructure business models as well as expand core operations and product lines. United Technologies has agreed to take over Rockwell Collins for $30 billion, while Northrop Grumman is set to buy Orbital ATK for $9.2 billion.While the deal will make United Technologies one of the world's largest aircraft equipment manufacturers, Northrop Grumman’s product line will benefit from Orbital's rocket motors, missiles and electro-optical countermeasure equipment. Slated to wrap up in 2018, synergies from these mega deals are sure to benefit the sector.Trump’s zeal to fortify the U.S. military has only strengthened the defense sector’s fortunes. The space rallied throughout last year, breaking boundaries in the second half of 2017 in particular. Most importantly, a reduction in corporate taxes to 21% has opened up more avenues for investments. Such developments have paved way for a plethora of acquisitions in the defense and aerospace segment in 2018.On Feb 12, the day Trump presented his second annual federal budget proposal, General Dynamics announced plans to purchase CSRA Inc  in a bid to venture and gradually expand the government sector business.Commenting on the deal, General Dynamics’ executive vice president of Information Systems & Technology Daniel Johnson stated that the company has an expanding budget and the analysts within the company believe that the services sector would spring back to pre-2011 conditions when the space was in its prime. This has encouraged the company to invest more on such ventures.Moreover, major defense contractors can expect a slew of contracts from the Pentagon. On the first day of 2018, Raytheon won a deal worth $333.4 million and Boeing secured a $193.6-million contract. With more such contracts anticipated, we expect major defense stocks to maintain the rally in 2018.U.S. Leads Global Defense ExportsEmerging nations like Japan and India as well as European countries are raising their defense budgets on account of the widespread geo-political uncertainties. As the United States is the largest supplier of defense equipment, it is without doubt a golden era for Aerospace & Defense stocks.According to the latest report from Aerospace Industries Association, United States led the global exports in the aerospace and defense segment in 2017. The country accounted for 34% of the total industry export. Further, U.S. Department of Commerce, the defense segment generated an astounding $143 billion from exports alone.Also, per the report from Aerospace Industries Association, China maintained the top spot as the largest importer of defense products from the U.S., accounting for a total of $16.3 billion worth of goods. Further, France and United Kingdom came in as the second and third, purchasing goods worth $12.9 billion and $10 billion, respectively.To ConcludeThe U.S. defense sector started off 2018 on solid note and is poised to witness stupendous growth in the days to come with a massive defense budget, steep reduction in corporate taxes and a plethora of merger deals and acquisitions lined up for 2018. Its recognition as the largest exporter of defense products in the world is another feather in its cap.Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2018In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2018?Last year's 2017 Zacks Top 10 Stocks portfolio produced double-digit winners, including FMC Corp. and VMware which racked up stellar gains of +67.9% and +61%.

1013,NOC,"We issued an updated research report on Orbital ATK  on Oct 16. Notably, this premier aerospace and defense company boasts a diverse product offering by designing, manufacturing and delivering launch vehicles and associated propulsion systems along with satellites and composite aerospace structures. It also supplies ammunitions and related accessories to the U.S. government agencies.Thanks to its diverse product portfolio, the company continues to win a steady stream of contracts from its customer base. Orbital exited 2016 with a backlog of nearly $14.4 billion (up 10% year over year), out of which firm backlog was $9.3 billion (up 13%).The company is currently involved with a number of development and production programs with projected 2017 capital expenditures to be nearly $225 million. These programs assure a steady source of revenues and inflow of new contract for the company.However, we should note that Defense is a highly competitive sector. Consequently, Orbital needs to introduce high-quality products and services primarily developed through technological upgrades, innovative research, development programs and skillful workforce, which in turn call for huge investments.The company also faces tough competition from its peers like Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report) and Spirit AeroSystems Holdings, Inc. (SPR  -  Free Report).Orbital is also subject to market risks arising out of changes in foreign currency exchange rates which could negatively impact profitability. Currency fluctuations may impact product demand and the prices of the raw materials. Further, operating margins may be negatively affected if it ends up paying high prices for raw materials.Since Northrop Grumman Corp.’s (NOC  -  Free Report) announcement of Orbital’s acquisition, shares of the later have dropped 0.9% compared with the industry’s gain of 3.2%. Evidently, following the news of the buyout, the company has been trading lower than the Zacks Aerospace-Defense Equipment industry.Considering the transaction price set at $134.50 per share for Orbital’s shareholders and the company having reached $133.44, as of Oct 16, we may say that there remains a very little upside potential of the stock, at present.Zacks RankOrbital currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1014,NOC,"Defense bellwether, Northrop Grumman Corporation’s (NOC  -  Free Report) business unit, Systems Corp., has won a modification contract worth $20.1 million. According to the latest contract Northrop will offer additional funds to upgrade EA-18G aircraft. The award was received from the U.S. Navy.Per the terms of the deal, the additional funds will help Northrop to enhance the airborne electronic attack (AEA) system for the AN/ALQ-218(V) 2 receiver on the EA-18G aircraft. Work related to this deal is expected to be accomplished by July 2019 and will be carried out in Point Mugu, CA.A Brief Note on EA-18G & AEAThe Boeing Company’s (BA  -  Free Report) EA-18G Growler is the most advanced AEA aircraft that can operate from an aircraft as well as from land bases. The EA-18G integrates advanced AEA capabilities which have been developed and manufactured by Northrop for identifying, degrading and destroying hostile radar-guided air defense and communication systems.Additionally, as the principal subcontractor to Boeing, Northrop designs and produces the EA-18G entire center fuselages and center barrel replacement assemblies and integrates all the associated subsystems including the electronic attack capabilities as well as conducting after-delivery product support.Our ViewBeing one of the largest aerospace and defense contractors in the United States, Northrop’s product line serves high-priority categories such as defense electronics, unmanned aircraft and missile defense satisfactorily. Northrop is a leading name in AEA technology, having designed, manufactured and delivered the first electronic attack systems more than five decades ago. Over the years, Northrop has refined and expanded AEA capabilities to ensure successful completion of missions.Rising terrorism and the recent spate in political hostility between the United States and North Korea have provided a solid boost to the aerospace and defense industry. Concurrently, the United States and its major allies’ move to strengthen their arsenals to combat the internal and external threats provided a substantial impetus to the stocks.On this note, the U.S. Senate recently passed fiscal 2018 defense policy bill worth $700 billion which provides about $640 billion fund for Pentagon’s main operations like buying weapons and paying the troops.Consequently, the current scenario in this industry is anticipated to boost defense majors like Northrop, Boeing and Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT  -  Free Report), as is evident from increasing number of contracts being awarded by the Pentagon in recent months. We believe the latest contract is an instance of the same and expect the company to win more such deals, in days ahead.Price MovementSince Northrop’s announcement of Orbital ATK  acquisition, shares of the company have rallied 7.2% compared with the industry’s gain of 3.5%. This shows that the news of the acquisition has received positive response from the market. Zacks RankNorthrop presently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1015,NOC,"General Dynamics Corp.’s (GD  -  Free Report) subsidiary, Electric Boat, has clinched a $28.6 million modification contract to exercise options for reactor plant planning yard services for nuclear-powered submarines.The company will also support yard services for the Navy’s moored training ships. Markedly, the deal has been awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C.About the ContractPer the modification contract, Electric Boat will offer furnishing, fabricating, or purchasing materials, supplies and services that will likely be required to perform the functions of the planning yard for reactor plants and related portions of the propulsion plants for nuclear powered submarines. The unit will also support yard services for moored training ships.While majority of the work will be performed at Groton, CT, the rest will be performed at Charleston, SC. It will be completed, using fiscal 2018 operations and maintenance (Navy) as well as fiscal 2017 other procurement (Navy) funds, by September 2018.Nuclear Submarines and the United StatesTo counter the rising geopolitical tensions across the world, the U.S. government has been designing submarines for decades. In 1954, the U.S. Navy was the first to launch a nuclear-powered submarine. These submarines were markedly better than the diesel-engine ones that had to make multiple stops for refueling.Currently, the U.S. Navy has three classes of nuclear-powered attack submarines — Virginia-class, Ohio-class and Los Angeles-class.In fact, the market for nuclear submarine is a consolidated one in the United States, operated by two prime players like General Dynamics and Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report). As a result, both the companies enjoy a large share of the market and high profit margins.In this context, it is imperative to mention that recently the U.S. administration has been allotting significant provision for nuclear submarines in the nation’s defense budget, thereby encouraging submarine-manufacturers in boosting their production. Evidently, in the fiscal 2017 budget proposal $8.1 billion fund was allocated for submarines.Our ViewGeneral Dynamics enjoys a dominant position as a Navy contractor. This is because it is one of the only two contractors in the world equipped to build nuclear-powered submarines. In addition, the company is a prime contractor for the development of Columbia-class submarines and Virginia-class submarines.Given the Navy’s recent acknowledgement of the nuclear submarines as its top priority and the huge budget allotted to the same, we believe the modification contract will undoubtedly render the company a leading position in the nuclear-powered submarine industry.Furthermore, the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee recently approved fiscal 2018 defense policy bill. The National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal 2018, worth $700 billion, includes $25 billion to boost Navy shipbuilding. Going forward, the bill is anticipated to boost revenue growth for General Dynamics, which is one of the prime shipbuilders in the United States.Price MovementShares of General Dynamics have surged 41.8% in a year, underperforming the industry’s gain of 43.7%. This might have been caused by the company’s declining backlogs in recent times. Additionally, the stock faces stiff competition from its industry peers like Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report).Zacks RankGeneral Dynamics carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1016,NOC,"Defense major, Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) business segment, Rotary and Mission Systems, recently clinched a contract to support AEGIS SPY-1 Radar requirements. Work related to this deal is scheduled to be over by Aug 2019.Details of the DealThe contract, which is valued at $23.4 million, has a two-year performance period. It has been awarded by the Supply Systems Command Weapon Systems Support, Mechanicsburg, PN.Per the deal, Lockheed Martin will maintain requisition support in reference to stringent availability and delivery metrics, inventory modeling, configuration management, obsolescence management, inventory warehousing, transportation and tracking, and furnishing both repairs and spares for 1,594 line items for fleet requirements.The company will utilize fiscal 2017 working capital (Navy) funding to complete the work, which will be carried out in Moorestown, NJ.What’s AEGIS?AEGIS or Advanced Electronic Guidance and Instrumentation System is an integrated missile-guidance system. With Lockheed Martin as its primary manufacturer, the AEGIS Weapons system is used by the U.S. Navy and allied ships to protect the battle group.Another company working on AEGIS is Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report), which is the manufacturer of this high-powered radar transmitter that tracks and guides missile functions. At the heart of the system is the AN/SPY-1, an advanced, automatic detect and track, multi-function phased-array radar.Over time, AEGIS has become an integral part of the U.S. Navy by evolving with new capabilities to counter emerging threats and leverage new technologies. Notably, its latest configuration, Baseline 9, offers an open architecture framework to allow extreme flexibility.Our ViewLockheed Martin's Rotary and Mission Systems business carries out some of the company's high-profile programs. These include the Aegis Combat System, Littoral Combat Ship, MH-60 helicopter avionics, along with military and commercial orders. Also, it generated revenues of $3.4 billion in the second quarter of 2017, reflecting almost 27% of its total revenue.Coming to order growth for this segment, the Sikorsky business line of the segment secured a five-year contract worth $3.8 billion for supplying 257 Black Hawk helicopters to the U.S. Army as well as to the Saudi Arabian National Guard, in the second quarter.Currently, the company’s AEGIS is the maritime weapon system of choice for six powerful nations. As of Jan 2017, 84 U.S. Navy ships were in service with the AEGIS Weapons System installed. This number will definitely increase given the strong demand for AEGIS prevalent across the globe. Considering this, we expect Lockheed Martin to bag more contracts like the latest one, in days ahead, which, in turn, will boost its profitability.Price MovementShares of Lockheed Martin rallied 16.1% in the last one year, underperforming the 34.3% rally of the industry it belongs to. This could have been caused by the company’s F-35 program, which, despite being a prime project of the U.S. government, has been repeatedly criticized for being overtly expensive. Moreover, Lockheed Martin faces stiff competition from other defense majors like The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) and Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC  -  Free Report).Zacks RankLockheed Martin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1017,NOC,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 8.2% in that time frame, outperforming the market.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is NOC due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Northrop Grumman Beats Q4 Earnings & Revenue EstimatesNorthrop Grumman reported fourth-quarter 2017 earnings of $2.82 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.75 by 2.5%.Reported earnings were $1.01, down nearly 65.9% from $2.96 recorded in the year-ago quarter. The decline was primarily due to higher tax expenses resulting from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.Total RevenuesIn fourth-quarter 2017, Northrop Grumman reported total revenues of $6.63 billion, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.37 billion by 4.1%.Revenues also increased 3.7% from the year-ago figure of $6.39 billion. The revenue upside was primarily driven by increase in Aerospace Systems and Mission Systems sales.Segmental DetailsAerospace Systems: Segment sales of $3 billion increased 5% year over year due to growth in Manned Aircraft and Autonomous Systems, partially offset by lower Space sales.However, Operating income was down 9% year over year to $298 million.Mission Systems: Segment sales increased 6% to $3.02 billion due to higher volume for Sensors and Processing and Advanced Capabilities programs.Operating income dropped 6.9% to $363 million while operating margin contracted 170 basis points (bps) to 12.0%.Technology Services: Sales at the segment dipped 0.8% to $1.19 billion, driven by lower sales volume for System Modernization and Advance Defense Services programs.Operating income increased 0.8% to $126 million while operating margin expanded 20 bps to 10.5%.Operational UpdateTotal operating cost and expenses in 2017 increased 5.6% to $22.5 billion.Operating income in 2017 increased 3.3% year over year to $3.3 billion.Total backlog at the end of 2017 was $42.9 billion, down 5.5% from the year-ago period primarily due to year-over-year decline in Aerospace Systems and Technology Services.Financial ConditionNorthrop Grumman’s cash and cash equivalents as of Dec 31, 2017 were $12.2 billion, up from $2.54 billion as of Dec 31, 2016.Long-term debt (net of current portion) as of Dec 31, 2017, was $14.4 billion, up from $7.06 billion as of 2016 end.Net cash flow from operating activities at the end of 2017 was $2.61 billion compared with the year-ago figure of $2.81 billion.Looking AheadNorthrop Grumman expects to generate total revenues in excess of $27 billion in 2018. The company expects free cash flow in the range of $2 billion to $2.3 billion in 2018. The 2018 earnings are expected to be in the range of $15 to $15.25 per share.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates. There has been one revision higher for the current quarter. While looking back an additional 30 days, we can see even more upward momentum. There have been three moves higher compared to one lower two months ago.Northrop Grumman Corporation Price and Consensus  Northrop Grumman Corporation Price and Consensus | Northrop Grumman Corporation QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, NOC has a nice Growth Score of B, however its Momentum is doing a bit better with an A. However, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Based on our scores, the stock is primarily suitable for momentum investors while also being suitable for those looking for growth and to a lesser degree value.OutlookEstimates have been trending upward for the stock and the magnitude of this revision looks promising. Notably, NOC has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.

The deal, worth $6.24 billion at current list prices, will become the airlines’ largest order of the MAX 10 variant to date.The order is expected to enable Lion Group optimize its network and increase profitability.A Brief Note on 737 MAXBoeing’s 737 MAX family of airplanes incorporate the latest CFM International LEAP-1B engines, Advanced Technology winglets, the Boeing Sky Interior and large flight deck displays. These features allow this family of jets to offer the greatest flexibility, reliability and efficiency in in the single-aisle market.Notably, the company believes that its 737 MAX 10 model will be the airlines' most profitable single-aisle airplane, offering the lowest seat costs ever.Boeing and Lion GroupLion Air, one of Boeing’s largest customers, was the first airline globally to put Boeing’s 737 MAX 8 jets into service and take delivery of the smaller 737 MAX 9 for expanding its international routes, earlier this year. Boeing currently delivers 737 Max and Next Generation 737 jets to the Jakarta-based airline company.Our ViewBoeing’s commercial business has been gaining traction in recent days, in the form of huge inflow of jet orders from airlines worldwide. The company recently received an order worth $12 billion to deliver 47 787-9 Dreamliners to American Airlines. A week back it also received orders worth $8.8 billion for 75 737 MAX Airplanes from Jet Airways.In 2017, Boeing’s revenues from its Commercial Airplanes were $56.7 billion, majorly driven by record 763 deliveries, including the delivery of the first 74 737 MAX airplanes.  Key milestones for the commercial airplane segment included the successful launch of the 737 MAX 10 and the transition of 737 production lines while increasing production of 47 airplanes per month. Boeing further anticipates the 737 MAX to account for between 40% and 45% of its total 737 deliveries in 2018.Moreover, on the commercial front, Boeing estimates demand for 41,030 new planes, worth $6.1 trillion in the next two decades. The company expects cost effective single-aisle jets to be the major demand driver, accounting for 72% of the total projection along with widebody jets, comprising over 20%. Recently, the company announced first-quarter delivery numbers that reflect 9% growth in its commercial shipments, primarily backed by higher demand for 737 jets. These developments allow us to expect that Boeing will continue to maintaining its position as one of the largest aerospace contractors worldwide and is likely to deliver similar performance in coming quarters.Price MovementBoeing’s stock has rallied about 86% in a year, compared with the broader industry’s gain of 46.2%. The outperformance was primarily led by the robust worldwide demand for its commercial aircraft and for its military jets. Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to Consider    Boeing currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).A few other top-ranked stocks in the same sector are Huntington Ingalls (HII  -  Free Report), Curtiss-Wright Corporation (CW  -  Free Report) and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report).

1021,NOC,"Rising tensions between the US and North Korea weighed on the markets on Wednesday. The blue-chip index briefly slipped from the 22,000 milestone but pared losses to finish above the psychological level. Decline in the Dow was primarily due to losses made by shares of Disney after the media behemoth announced plans to end its distribution deal with Netflix. Escalating geopolitical uncertainties pushed the defense stocks up but weighed on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) closed at 22,048.70, declining by 0.2% or 36.64 points. The S&P 500 Index (INX) declined less than 0.1%, decreasing 0.9 point to close at 2,474.02. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 6,352.33, slipping 18.13 points or 0.3%. A total of around 6.48 billion shares were traded on Monday, above the last 20-session average of 6.16 billion shares. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 2.29-to-1 ratio. On the Nasdaq, decliners outnumbered advancers by a 2.47-to-1 ratio.Disney Slide Fells DowGeopolitical uncertainty between US and North Korea heightened, weighing heavily on the broader markets. The blue-chip index was dragged down primarily by a plunge in shares of The Walt Disney Co. (DIS  -  Free Report). These losses occurred after the media giant announced its plans to discontinue its distribution deal with Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) and launch its in-house Disney and ESPN steaming services.However, Disney posted better-than-expected earnings for the third straight quarter, as it reported third-quarter fiscal 2017 results. (Read More: Disney (DIS  -  Free Report) Q3 Earnings Top, Unveils Streaming Services)Market Wobbles Due To Geopolitical TensionsThe rising tension between Washington and Pyongyang, after the latter announced plans to attack the Guam Naval base, spiked the defense stocks. Shares of Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report), Raytheon (RTN  -  Free Report), General Dynamics (GD  -  Free Report) and Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report) all increased by 1.7%, 2.6%, 1.1% and 1.2% respectively. The Dow Jones U.S. defense index soared 1.6%.  Despite S&P 500’s declined over the trading day, seven of the index’s eleven primary sectors ended in positive territory, with utilities leading the decliners and followed by consumer-discretionary, telecom and financial sectors. According to experts, the index has been surprisingly calm with small intraday moves. The S&P 500 has gained or lost 0.3% for close to 15 sessions now. On Wednesday, the index overcame a point 13 point deficit incurred earlier in the session. The Nasdaq also ended in the red but was able to pare a 61 point decline suffered earlier in the session.Volatility Rises, But Remains at Record LowsThe CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) hit a one month high despite trading near all time lows. The best gauge of fear in the market- VIX, was up less than a point by 5.8% to 11.60. By all accounts, this has been the quietest stretch of trading since 1965. One estimate puts the current level of volatility at the lowest in 52 years.

1022,NOC,"Shares of several companies with ties to U.S. defense spending, including Lockheed Martin, climbed to new all-time highs on Wednesday, as tensions between North Korea, the U.S., and the United Nations continue to escalate.The growing conflict between the U.S. and North Korea sent many markets around the world down on Tuesday and Wednesday. One of the biggest reasons for the decline is a new heightened war of words between President Donald Trump and Pyongyang representatives, which stem from UN Security Council economic sanctions that were imposed unanimously on North Korea over the weekend—the sanctions will reportedly cut off $1 billion from the nation’s annual foreign revenue.Since then, an aggressive back and forth has occurred between the U.S. president and the North Korean capital. On Tuesday, President Trump warned North Korea against continuing its threats, or testing missiles, saying the U.S. would respond with “fire and fury like the world has never seen.”Pyongyang then responded that it would consider using missiles against Guam, a U.S. territory in the Pacific that houses U.S. military bases.Wasting little time, President Trump took to Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report) on Wednesday morning to boast about the renewed strength of America’s nuclear arsenal.My first order as President was to renovate and modernize our nuclear arsenal. It is now far stronger and more powerful than ever before....— Donald J.

1023,NOC,"The Boeing Co. (BA  -  Free Report) has clinched a contract for Next Generation Thermal, Power and Controls (NGT-PAC) program. Work related to this deal is scheduled to be over by Jul 2024.Details of the DealValued at $409 million, the contract has been awarded by the Air Force Research Laboratory, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, OH.In fact, this deal is a joint effort of multiple government agencies and industry to develop revolutionary and innovative technologies. Through this contract, applied research will also be conducted for enhancing knowledge and understanding of future power, thermal and controls requirements.Work will be carried out at Hazelwood, MI, using fiscal 2017 research and development funds.Why Boeing?Boeing is one of the major players in the defense business. In fact, the company stands out among its peers by virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and solid backlog.In particular, among other defense equipment, Boeing’s forte has been combat-proven aircraft. Also, it started developing military aerial refueling and strategic transport aircraft of late. Notably, with its proven expertise in aerospace programs, the company has been clinching a huge number of contracts from the Pentagon for long.In June, Boeing secured a modification to a foreign military sales contract worth $410.9 million from the U.S. Army Contracting Command, Redstone Arsenal, AL. Per the terms of the original contract, it will provide 38 Apache aircraft, three Longbow crew trainers and associated spares to the U.K. government.Again, the company’s unit secured a contract, valued at $475 million, to provide intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance services in support of the Mid-Endurance Unmanned Aircraft Systems program, at multiple locations across the globe. Going forward, we expect these contracts to add further impetus to the company’s growth trajectory.Considering the favorable budgetary scenario now, we expect such generous fund flows from Pentagon, in the form of contracts, to help Boeing achieve its desired business expansion in the near term.Interestingly, Trump’s presidency seems to have created a win-win situation for the Aerospace and Defense big shots like Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report) and Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report). Evidently, these stocks saw a notable rise after Trump presented his “America First” budget.Additionally, an increase in fund flow from the Pentagon raised optimism. Hence, we expect these factors to enable Boeing in winning more such scrumptious orders in the days ahead.Price MovementShares of Boeing have rallied 79.8% in the last 12 months, outperforming the industry’s gain of 34.6%. This could be because the company’s strong balance sheet and cash flows that provide financial flexibility in matters of incremental dividend, ongoing share repurchases and earnings accretive acquisitions.Zacks RankBoeing currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1024,NOC,"Military shipbuilder General Dynamics Corporation’s (GD  -  Free Report) business division, Electric Boat, recently secured a modification contract worth $20.6 million for planning and execution of USS Washington (SSN 787) in the post-delivery work period. Work related to this deal is scheduled to be over by February 2018.Details of the DealThe contract was awarded by the Supervisor of Shipbuilding, Conversion and Repair, Groton, CT. Per the terms of the agreement, Electric Boat will conduct planning and execution-related tasks including long-lead-time material procurement. These tasks will aid in accomplishing the maintenance, repair, alterations, testing and other work on USS Washington during the scheduled post-delivery work period.Majority of the work will be carried out in Newport News, VA. The company will utilize fiscal 2015, 2016, and 2017 shipbuilding and conversion funds to finish the task.A Brief Note on USS WashingtonUSS Washington is a nuclear powered, fast attack submarine (SSN) designed to operate in shallow coastal regions and maintaining the capacity for open ocean submarine warfare. It is the 14th Virginia-class attack submarine.Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report), another stalwart in military shipbuilding space, along with General Dynamics, co-manufactured USS Washington. It is believed, that upon delivery, this ship will be the most technologically advanced submarine in the U.S. Navy’s service. It will also be the least expensive submarine as its design incorporates significant innovations to reduce acquisition costs over earlier ships of the class without impacting mission capabilities. The USS Washington was commissioned on Oct 7.Our ViewBeing one of the only two contractors in the world equipped to build nuclear-powered submarines, General Dynamics enjoys a dominant position as a Navy contractor.In December 2015, the Navy updated its force-level goal from its prior target to achieve and maintain a 308-ship fleet that comprises 48 SSNs to 355-ship fleet, including 66 SSNs. This, in turn, clearly reflects the immense priority that the U.S. Navy bestows upon this class of nuclear submarines.The Navy plans to build an advanced model of Virginia-class submarines in the subsequent years. This will come with an additional mid-body section, called the Virginia Payload Module (VPM).  In fact, the Navy has already proposed fiscal 2017 budget requests worth $97.9 million in research and development funding for the VPM.Since majority of such attack submarines are co-developed by General Dynamics and Huntington Ingalls, for the construction of VPM, Pentagon will offer lucrative additional defense contracts to both these shipbuilders, which, in turn, is expected to boost their growth trajectory.Furthermore, the Navy has acknowledged the Virginia-class program as one of its top priority, and a sumptuous budget has been allotted to the same. This bodes well for General Dynamics with the company being identified as the prime contractor for Virginia-Class submarines, in 2016. As a result, we expect the latest modification contract has the ability to put the company in a leading position in the nuclear-powered submarine industry.Price MovementShares of General Dynamics's have rallied about 40.9% over a year, underperforming the industry's gain of 55%. This may have been caused by the fact that the company is witnessing declining backlogs in recent times. Moreover, the stock also faces stiff competition from its industry peers like Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report).Zacks RankGeneral Dynamics currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1025,NOC,"Lockheed Martin Corporation’s (LMT  -  Free Report) business segment, Rotary and Missions Systems (RMS), recently secured a foreign military sales (FMS) contract for manufacturing DDG AEGIS weapon system J7 baseline. The weapon system will support the Japan Maritime Self Defense Force.Valued at $135.8 million, the contract was awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C. Work related to this is scheduled to be over by December 2018.Majority of the work will be carried out in Moorestown, NJ; while the rest will be carried out at Dahlgren, VA and a few cities of Japan. FMS fund will be used partially to finance the task.A Brief Note on Aegis & J7 BaselineManufactured by Lockheed Martin, Aegis is the world’s most advanced combat system that can simultaneously destroy land targets, submarines, and surface ships along with providing protection against aircraft, cruise missiles and ballistic missiles. The computer-based command and decision element is the core of the AEGIS combat system. The Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) system is the primary sea-based component of the U.S. missile defense system.The USS John Paul Jones (DDG-53) is a guided missile destroyer battleship, currently in service with the U.S. Navy. It is the third of the 75 planned Arleigh Burke-class of surface ships. While DD represents the basic destroyers per US Navy classifications, G stands for its guided missile armament design. It uses the latest evolution of Lockheed Martin’s Aegis Combat System to detect, track, launch a missile and successfully intercept a Medium Range Ballistic Missile target.In a joint research program conducted by the United States and Japan, Lockheed Martin is developing an Aegis Baseline 9.C2 (BMD 5.1) variant computer program, referred to as J7, for deployment on Japan’s Aegis destroyers.What’s Ahead for Lockheed Martin?Lockheed Martin's RMS segment carries out some of the company's high-profile programs, including the Aegis Combat System, Littoral Combat Ship, MH-60 helicopter avionics along with military and commercial orders.Presently, Lockheed Martin's Aegis system is the maritime weapon system choice for six powerful nations. Moreover, apart from its strong forte across the United States, the company also enjoys a solid position in the defense-field in the overseas as well. Therefore the latest contract will surely expand the company’s international footprint.In August 2016, Lockheed Martin announced plans to expand the global Aegis fleet in the United States, Japan and the Republic of Korea, under a $490-million deal to develop integrated air and missile defense (IAMD) capabilities. We believe the latest contract will allow Lockheed Martin’s to achieve this target.Needless to say, such contract wins will keep the company on a solid growth trajectory. Although, during third quarter 2017, the RMS unit delivered sales growth of mere 0.2%, management has enhanced its 2017 sales outlook for this segment. This indicates signs of growth prospects for the unit in the fourth quarter, in which contracts like the latest one will play a solid role.Additionally, the 2018 fiscal defense bill worth $700 billion has further boosted the probability of increased  order inflow from various departments of the U.S. Defense for major defense contractors like Lockheed Martin, Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report), The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) and others.Price PerformanceLockheed Martin’s stock has returned 28% in last 12 months, underperforming the 43.3% rally of the industry it belongs to. This underperformance was mostly led by intense competition that the company faces in the domestic and international markets.  Zacks Rank Lockheed Martin currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1026,NOC,"Northrop Grumman Systems Corp.’s (NOC  -  Free Report) business unit, Northrop Grumman Systems Corp., recently secured a contract to support the AAQ-24 large aircraft infrared counter-measure (LAIRCM) direct sales public private partnership for repair of 34 national stock numbers. Work related to this deal is scheduled to be over by Dec 14, 2022 and will be executed in Warner Robins, GA.Valued at $444.6 million, the contract was awarded by the Air Force Sustainment Center, Robins Air Force Base, GA. Foreign military funds (FMS) funds will be used to partly finance the task.A Brief Note on LAIRCMThe primary purpose of Northrop Grumman’s LAIRCM program is to protect large aircraft from man-portable missiles. On identifying a missile, LAIRCM activates a high-intensity, laser-based countermeasure system to track and destroy the missile automatically.Our ViewOf late, terrorist groups have been increasingly using cheap yet deadly man-portable missiles. Thus, an effective anti-missile solution for the protection against such threats is the need of the hour. A well-equipped nation like the United States thus will always want to remain prepared for sudden attacks.Moreover, over the past few months, repeated missile threats from North Korea have forced the United States to ramp up its focus toward its missile defense space. Undoubtedly, this has led the Trump administration to multiply its arsenal treasury, both in terms of attacking missiles as well as accumulating protective measures like LAIRCM.Currently, Northrop Grumman’s AN/AAQ-24(V) Directional Infrared Countermeasure (DIRCM) system is the only DIRCM system in production that protects an aircraft from infrared-guided missiles. LAIRCM is one variant of such a DIRCM. Considering the present situation in the nation and Northrop Grumman’s combat-proven LAIRCM, more contracts like the recent one can be expected to boost Northrop’s sales.Moreover, per Markets and Markets research firm, the global rocket and missile market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 4.74% during 2017-2022 to reach a value of $70 billion by 2022. This further reflects substantial growth prospects for defense majors like Northrop Grumman that offer counter-measures against missile threats.Further, the Senate’s approval for the $700 billion National Defense Authorization Act this September indicates significant inflow of contracts for the front-row defense stocks in the United States. Therefore, the time is ripe for adding defense majors like Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT  -  Free Report), Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report) and The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report), in your watchlist.Price PerformanceNorthrop Grumman’s stock has returned 15.5% in last three months, outperforming the 10.3% rally of the industry it belongs to. This may have been driven bythe fact that the company’s product line is well positioned in high priority categories, such as defense electronics, unmanned aircraft and missile defense. Zacks Rank Northrop Grumman currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1027,NOC,"Raytheon Company’s (RTN  -  Free Report) business unit, Missile Systems, recently secured a modification contract worth $302.4 million under the Foreign Military Sales program. Work related to this deal is scheduled to be over by June 2022.Details of the DealThe contract was awarded by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD. Per the terms of the agreement, Raytheon will procure 618 Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW) air-to-ground missiles (AGM-154 Block III C), containers, component parts/support equipment (spares) and engineering technical assistance. These weapons and associated support will be provided to the government of Saudi Arabia.Majority of the work will be executed in Tucson, AZ; Glascoed, Wales, U.K. and Dallas, TX; while the rest will be carried out in Glasgow, Scotland, UK and various other U.S. locations. FMS funds will be utilized to partly fund the order.A Brief Note on AGM-154The JSOW AGM-154 is a family of low-cost, air-to-ground glide missiles (AGM) manufactured by Raytheon. These missiles employ an integrated GPS-inertial navigation system and thermal imaging infrared seeker.The JSOW-C-1 — a variant of this missile — also known as a JSOW Block III, provides upgraded capability to strike moving land and maritime targets. A modification to the existing JSOW C weapon, this variant adds a weapon datalink radio and modified seeker software to increase capability for the anti-surface warfare mission.Our ViewWith the recent rise in cyber-attacks, terrorism threats and geopolitical instability, demand for advanced weaponries across the globe has increased over the last few years. As a result, with the United States being the largest supplier of arms and ammunitions, major defense contractors of this nation has been witnessing a scrumptious inflow of orders from domestic as well as international customers.   Of late, the frequent counter-missile testing between the United States and North Korea has provided impetus to the country to ramp up their defense inventories. Needless to say, this has benefitted the country’s major missile-makers as well as those offering modification services associated with these missiles like Raytheon, Orbital ATK, Inc. , Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report) and Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC  -  Free Report).Coming to Raytheon’s performance specifically, its Missile Systems segment has been clinching significant awards from the United States as well as international customers, courtesy of its high-end, combat-proven advanced arsenals. To this end, in October, the company won a $300-million worth contract for supplying Tube-launched Optically-tracked Wireless-guided missiles. Based on the 10% sales growth that this unit witnessed in the third quarter of 2017 and the continuous flow of contracts it’s being winning including the latest one, we may expect to see similar performance in days ahead.Moreover, per Markets and Markets research firm, the global rocket and missile market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 4.74% during 2017-2022 to reach a value of $70 billion by 2022. This further reflects substantial growth prospects for renowned missile-maker like Raytheon.Price PerformanceRaytheon’s stock has returned 31.3% over a year, outperforming the 25.9% rally of the industry it belongs to. This may have been driven by rising demand of the company’s missile systems from the Gulf countries and Asia-Pacific, apart from domestic customers. Zacks Rank Raytheon currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1028,NOC,"General Dynamics Corp.’s (GD  -  Free Report) Electric Boat division recently secured a $45.9-million contract for the New England Maintenance Manpower Initiative. Per the terms of the deal, the company will carry out non-nuclear maintenance of submarines based at Naval Submarine Support Facility in New London, CT. The deal has been awarded by The Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C.Details of the Deal    Per the contract, Electric Boat will provide non-nuclear repair services to support submarine overhauls, maintenance, repair, modernization upgrades, ship alterations, temporary modifications and field changes. In addition, it will deliver supplies, ancillary, corrective and preventative maintenance services.Work is scheduled to be over by December 2022 and will be executed in Groton, CT. Fiscal 2018 operations and maintenance funds will be used to partially finance work under the contract. Notably, the cumulative value of the contract may go up to $240 million, if the options included in it are exercised.Defense ScenarioThe defense industry got a heavy boost from the approval of fiscal 2018 defense policy bill worth $700 billion by the U.S. Senate in September. This bill provides about $640 billion for Pentagon’s main operations like buying weapons and paying the troops. The remaining $60 billion proposed for Overseas Contingency Operations will be utilized to fund the military operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and other terror afflicted region.This raised defense budget is certainly expected to rake in more orders for major defense contractors such as General Dynamics, Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report), Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT  -  Free Report) and The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) that are dealing with different verticals of the U.S. Defense.Our ViewGeneral Dynamics, being one of the only two contractors in the world equipped to build nuclear-powered submarines, enjoys a dominant position as a Navy contractor. Nations are strategically strengthening their arsenal and naval power through upgrading submarines as widespread geo-political tensions loom large.Notably, the U.S. Navy recently acknowledged nuclear submarines as its top priority. On top of that, a budget of $6 billion has been allotted for boosting Navy shipbuilding, under the recently- passed fiscal 2018 defense bill. This should help General Dynamics clinch more contracts and strengthen its position in the nuclear-powered submarine industry.Price MovementShares of General Dynamics have rallied 15.7% year to date, underperforming the industry’s gain of 34.3%. The underperformance may have been caused by the earlier budget cuts by the prior U.S. government. Zacks RankGeneral Dynamics carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1029,NOC,"L-3 Technologies, Inc.’s (LLL  -  Free Report) Vertex Aerospace business unit has won a modification contract worth $10.25 million for providing logistics support to the T-1A aircraft. The contract was awarded by the Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma.Details of the DealPer the agreement, L-3 Technologies will offer contractor-operated maintained supply services, over and above, on-equipment maintenance along with data and field service representatives.Work is scheduled to be over by Mar 31, 2018, and will be executed at Vance Air Force Base, Oklahoma; Columbus Air Force Base, Mississippi; Laughlin Air Force Base, Texas; Joint Base San Antonio-Randolph, Texas; and Pensacola Naval Air Station, Florida. Fiscal 2018 operations and maintenance funds will be used to finance the task.A Brief Note on T-1A AircraftThe T-1A aircraft is a medium-range, twin-engine jet trainer aircraft used for advanced pilot training. It is used by the Air Force for flying strategic, tactical airlift and tanker aircraft.Our ViewThe defense industry received a boost when the U.S. Senate approved a fiscal 2018 defense policy bill worth $700 billion in September 2017. This bill provides about $640 billion for Pentagon’s main operations, like buying weapons and paying for the troops. The remaining $60 billion is proposed for Overseas Contingency Operations and will be utilized to fund military operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and elsewhere.This raised budget is expected to help draw orders for major defense contractors like L3 Technologies, Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report), Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT  -  Free Report) and The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report).During the third quarter of 2017, owing to the loss of the re-competition of the Fort Rucker Maintenance Support contract, the company decided to sell its Vertex Aerospace unit, anticipating that the carrying amount of the goodwill for this unit may not be recoverable. Thus, the latest contract may not prove profitable for L3 Technologies.Nevertheless, excluding Vertex Aerospace, units of L3 Technologies cater to various defense-related products, which we believe will help the company maintain its leading position in the global security market. In fact, divesting Vertex Aerospace seems to be a prudent move as continuing with a loss-incurring segment offers no benefit to a company’s growth. Instead streamlining its operations toward other realms of the defense space will be more gainful.Such contract wins may or may not benefit the company, as we are not yet aware of what the company’s strategy will be regarding the services it provides through Vertex Aerospace, once it sell out this unit; i.e. whether to keep all the services or a few of them.Price MovementShares of L3 Technologies have rallied 20.5% year to date, lagging the industry’s gain of 28.5%.The underperformance can be attributed to low contract orders from international markets and weak performance in some of the product lines.Zacks RankL3 Technologies carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1030,NOC,"L3 Technologies Inc.’s (LLL  -  Free Report) Vertex Aerospace business unit recently clinched a modification contract for providing additional support to the U.S. Navy’s T-45 Goshawk aircraft system. Work related to this deal is scheduled to be over by September 2018.Details of the DealValued at $37.6 million, the contract was awarded by the Naval Air Warfare Center Training System Division, Orlando, FL. Per the terms of the agreement, Vertex Aerospace will offer additional organizational, intermediate and depot level maintenance, logistics as well as engineering services to support and maintain approximately 200 T-45 Goshawk aircraft and aircraft systems.It will also provide equipments to support flight and test and evaluation operations. Majority of the work will be carried out in Naval Air Station (NAS) Kingsville, TX and NAS Meridian, MS; while the rest will be executed in NAS Pensacola, FL and NAS Patuxent River, MD. Funds will be provided on issuance of individual task orders.A Brief Note on T-45 Goshawk aircraft  T-45 Goshawk — manufactured by Aerospace giant The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) — is a militarized version of the land-based British Aerospace Hawk. Its latest version, the T-45C, with a digital cockpit to train pilots destined for the F/A-18 Hornet, the AV-8B Harrier II and other carrier-based aircraft, made its first flight in October 1997. It had two multifunction displays in each cockpit; the displays provided navigation, weapon delivery, aircraft performance and communication data.Although, Boeing delivered the 221st and final T-45 training jet to the Navy in November 2009, it  continued to support the T-45 fleet by providing engineering, logistics and support equipment in partnership with BAE Systems plc (BAESY), which supplied the aircraft’s rear and center fuselage sections, wing assembly and vertical tail.Our ViewL3 Technologies is transforming its business portfolio to focus more on defense electronics, communications and ISR markets where it has leading positions. Toward this end, its Aerospace Systems segment, constituting Vertex Aerospace unit, delivers integrated solutions for the global ISR market and provides engineering, modernization, upgrade, sustainment, and maintenance and logistics support for a wide variety of aircraft and ground systems.However, during the third quarter, owing to the loss of the recompetition of the Fort Rucker Maintenance Support contract, the company decided to sell off its Vertex Aerospace unit, anticipating that the carrying amount of the goodwill for this unit may not be recoverable. So the latest contract may not benefit L3 Technologies.Nevertheless, excluding Vertex Aerospace, units of L3 Technologies caters to various defense-related products, which we believe will help the company to maintain its leading position in the global security market. In fact, divesting Vertex Aerospace seems to be a wise decision as continuing with a loss-incurring segment offers no benefit to a company’s growth. Instead streamlining its operations toward other realms of the defense space will surely be profitable for L3 Technologies. Toward this end, in the third quarter, the company combined its Greenville and Waco operations of Aerospace segment and reduced headcount by over 700 people, to cut cost and add more value to its business.Meanwhile, the defense industry got a heavy boost when the U.S. Senate passed fiscal 2018 defense policy bill worth $700 billion this September. This increased budget is expected to rake in more orders for defense majors such as L3 Technologies, Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC  -  Free Report) and Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report).Price Performance L3 Technologies stock has returned 21.8% over a year, underperforming the 30.3% rally of the industry it belongs to.

1031,NOC,"Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) business segment, Aeronautics has won a modification contract to procure 53,164 level-of-effort hours to support air system software integration. The company will also secure 53,122 level-of-effort hours to support flight test operations for the F-35 aircraft platform.Contract DetailsValued at $23 million, this contract has been awarded by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD. The services will be used by the Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps and non-U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) participants.Notably, the contract covers 40% of the purchases for the Air Force, 20% for the U.S. Navy, 20% for the Marine Corps and non-U.S. DoD participants each.Majority of the work related to this deal will be carried out in Fort Worth, TX, while the rest will be executed in Palmdale, CA and Patuxent River, MD. The deal is expected to be complete by February 2018.Lockheed Martin will utilize fiscal 2018 operations and maintenance (Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps) and non-U.S. DoD participant funds to complete the work.A Brief Note on F-35Lockheed Martin’s F-35 Lightning II is a 5th Generation, single-seat, single-engine fighter jet. It offers a combination of advanced stealth as well as fighter speed and agility, fully fused sensor information, network-enabled operations and advanced sustainment.With Lockheed Martin being the primary partner of the F-35 program, it has also been supported by an international team of leading aerospace majors like Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC  -  Free Report), BAE Systems plc (BAESY  -  Free Report) and Pratt & Whitney — an unit of United Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report).Our ViewWe remind investors that despite offering superior air security and stability, the F-35 program has been facing some engine-related technical issues for the last few years. Additionally, it has been repeatedly criticized by President Trump for being an overtly expensive project, in the recent past.Therefore, Lockheed Martin inked an $8.5-billion deal with Pentagon in February 2017. Per the agreement, the company will deliver 90 F-35s of the 10th Lot at a historically low rate to maintain management's earlier projection of cutting down cost by 6-7%.Over the next few years, the company is likely to adopt a cost-saving initiative to lower sustainment costs for F-35 by 10%, This, in turn, will result in cost savings of $1 billion over a five-year period.In fact, we believe that the recent contract win will also enable the company to take a step toward achieving this goal and allow it to provide more of these combat aircraft at an efficiently reduced rate.Meanwhile, Lockheed Martin is enjoying steady flow of notable contracts from the Pentagon since reduction of its F-35 price. In July 2017, the company secured a modification contract worth $5.6 billion to offer low-rate initial production (LRIP) of the 11th lot of F-35. Again, in August 2017 it won a contract worth $258 million to offer LRIP of the 10th lot of F-35.Furthermore, with the U.S. government expecting to spend approximately $400 billion in the upcoming decades for the development and purchase of 2,443 F-35 jets, Lockheed Martin is trying its best to effectively reduce the price of this program. Therefore, the government is likely to place larger orders for this program, which in trun will boost the company’s profits, in days ahead.Price MovementLockheed Martin’s stock was up about 16.8% in a year compared with the broader industry’s gain of 34.8%. This underperformance could have been caused by the intense competition owing to its broad portfolio of products and services domestically as well as internationally.Zacks RankLockheed Martin carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1032,NOC,"Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) business segment, Rotary and Missions Systems (RMS) has won a modification contract for exercising options to procure technical insertion (TI)-16 Acoustic Rapid Commercial Off-the-Shelf Insertion (A-RCI) systems, pre-cable kits and A-RCI sonar engineering services.Contract DetailsValued at $102 million, this contract has been awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington Navy Yard, Washington, DC.The majority of the work will be carried out in Manassas, VA, while the rest will be executed in Clearwater, FL. The deal is expected to be complete by December 2018.Lockheed Martin will utilize fiscal 2018 shipbuilding and conversion (Navy), fiscal 2018 research and development test and evaluation, and fiscal 2018 other procurement (Navy) funds to complete the work.A Brief Note on A-RCI SystemsA-RCI is an open-architecture sonar system that uses legacy sensors. It also replaces central processors with commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) computer technology and software within submarines.  This system helps the U.S. Navy in searching, detecting and tracking submarines and surface vessels in open-ocean and littoral sea environments without being counter-detected. It facilitates covert execution of Naval Special Warfare missions and under-ice operations as well.In the 1990s, Lockheed Martin unveiled A-RCI Systems, which allowed frequent hardware and software upgrades. The system was highly effective and offered improved acoustic quieting measures at a far lower cost than previously possible. Notably, the A-RCI TI 18-20 engineering services provide engineering development to support modernization requirements.Our ViewWith the rapid rise in terrorist attacks over the last decade, the U.S. Navy’s focus has shifted to littoral waters, the shallow areas near coastlines. These are the areas that it must patrol and defend against small subs, underwater mines and fast attack boats. Considering this, the need for timely detection and localization of quiet subs in the especially noisy shallow-water sonar field has made the ARCI submarine sonar system very much critical. Additionally, constant upgrades of the system have made it more valuable for the nation’s naval base and an attractive choice of defense equipment for the U.S. allied countries.As geopolitical uncertainty continues to prevail across the globe, we expect renowned defense contractors like Lockheed Martin to win more such deals in the days to come. A quick peek into the company’s third-quarter earnings numbers also reflects this. In particular, the RMS segment generated revenues of $3.4 billion in the third quarter, reflecting 27.9% of the company’s total revenues.Moreover, the company's improved cash outlook for 2017 reflects enhanced cash performance at the Rotary and Mission Systems division. That said, the aforementioned contract gain has the potential to boost revenues at this segment.Furthermore, the fiscal 2018 defense policy has authorized the United States to spend $700 billion on defense. This has further enhanced the prospect of increased order flow from Pentagon for major defense contractors like Lockheed Martin, Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report), The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) and others.Price MovementLockheed Martin’s stock was up about 19.8% in a year compared with the broader industry’s gain of 36%. This underperformance could have been caused by the intense competition that the company faces owing to its broad portfolio of products and services domestically as well as internationally.Zacks RankLockheed Martin carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1033,NOC,"Northrop Grumman Corporation’s (NOC  -  Free Report) pending acquisition of Orbital ATK  finally got the approval from the latter’s shareholders on 29th Nov. Earlier, in September, the two defense majors inked a take-over deal worth $9.2 billion, by which Northrop Grumman agreed to buy  Orbital ATK by the first half of 2018.Notably, shareholders of Orbital ATK holding over 99% of common stock present at the meeting or represented by proxy, voted in favor of this merger agreement. This, in turn, represents 79% of the total number of outstanding shares of Orbital ATK’s common stock as of Oct 10, 2017.Benefits of the AcquisitionNorthrop Grumman continues to enjoy strong presence in Air Force, Space & Cyber Security programs. The company’s product innovation and focus on strengthening its ISR wing is anticipated to help maintain a stable earnings stream, amid rapidly changing requirements of the defense landscape.With the Orbital ATK buyout, Northrop Grumman is expected to benefit from the former's rocket motors, missiles and electro-optical countermeasure product lines. According to Wes Bush — chairman, chief executive officer and president of Northrop Grumman — the merger will offer increased competition, greater innovation and a broader set of capabilities that would aid its customers in solving their toughest challenges.Furthermore, Orbital ATK’s knowledge and expertise in satellites, spacecraft components and commercial space launch system will expand Northrop Grumman’s product offering, thereby providing tough competition to the existing defense companies.Per Orbital ATK’s 2016 financials, the company's contracts with the NASA and the U.S. Army is expected to boost Northrop Grumman’s product portfolio and rake in more than $4.4 billion, in the form of annual revenues.Earlier while announcing the deal Northrop Grumman had said that post merger this new business unit will be accretive to its earnings per share and free cash flow per share, in the second half of 2018.Also, the merger will be accretive to Northrop Grumman’s earnings per share and free cash flow in the first year of acquisition and lead to annual cost savings of nearly $150 million by 2020.Incidentally, President Trump has requested to increase fiscal 2018 defense spending by 10% from the present level. Considering this, we expect the combined company to hold a larger portion of the U.S. Defense order through its diverse product portfolio.Another Mega Deal in the SpaceExpansion through acquisition is not new in the defense industry. In September, United Technologies Corp. (UTX  -  Free Report) finalized the deal to acquire Rockwell Collins Inc. (COL  -  Free Report) for $30 billion. The deal is projected to be concluded by the third quarter of 2018, depending on consents from Rockwell Collins’ shareowners and other customary closing conditions including the receipt of required regulatory approvals.Price MovementFollowing Northrop Grumman’s announcement of Orbital ATK acquisition, shares of the former company have rallied 11.1% compared with the industry’s gain of 5.5%.

Recent North Korea missile strikes, Trump’s Afghanistan friendly plan, and wave of consolidation added to the strength (read: Trump's Afghanistan Rhetoric Helps/Hurts These ETFs).The latest catalyst is U.S. defense contractor Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report), which has agreed to buy missile and rocket maker Orbital ATK Inc.  for $9.2 billion (including debt).Inside The DealUnder the terms of the deal, Northrop will pay $134.50 per share in cash, reflecting a 22% premium over Orbital ATK’s closing stock price on Sep 15, and will assume $1.4 billion in debt. The acquisition, expected to be completed in the first half of 2018, has already been approved by the board of directors of both companies and is pending approval from their shareholders and regulators.The proposed deal will bolster Northrop’s missile and space business by providing access to lucrative billion-dollar contracts with NASA and the U.S. Army as well as contracts with the U.S. Missile Defense Agency. It will also help Northrop to increase its arsenal of missile defense systems (read: 3 Top Ranked Aerospace and Defense ETFs for Your Portfolio).The transaction is expected to be accretive to earnings per share and free cash flow per share in the first full year after completion, and will generate annual cost savings of $150 million by 2020.

1035,NOC,"On Monday, shares of Orbital ATK  are soaring, up over 20% in morning trading after it was announced that defense giant Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report) would be buying the company for $7.8 billion in cash while assuming $1.4 billion in debt. NOC stock is up about 1.5% in morning trading as well.Orbital shareholders are set to receive $134.50 per share, which represents a 22% premium to its Friday close of $110.04. Orbital has made a name for itself designing and manufacturing space, defense, and aviation-related systems, in particular rocket motors that power missiles and target launch vehicles that are used during missile defense systems tests.“The acquisition of Orbital ATK is an exciting strategic step as we continue to invest for profitable growth,” said Wes Bush, Northrop’s chief executive, in a statement. “Through our combination, customers will benefit from expanded capabilities, accelerated innovation and greater competition in critical global security domains.”Northrop has one of the largest footprints in the defense industry today, and is one of the Pentagon’s leading suppliers. Along with rival Boeing (BA  -  Free Report), the company is working with the Air Force on the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent program, designing a new intercontinental ballistic missile system. And, Northrop won a highly-coveted contract to develop the B-21 stealth bomber.With Orbital, Northrop’s presence could grow even bigger. Along with its missile designs, Orbital holds a contract with NASA to resupply the International Space Station with its Antares rocket. According to The LA Times, the company has also developed a rocket called the Pegasus that can be attached to its Stargazer L-1011 airplane, as well as the still-in-development Next Generation Launcher (NGL), which Orbital hopes to get certified by the U.S. Air Force.The Northrop-Orbital acquisition, which is subject to regulatory approval, is expected to close in the first half of 2018. And after the deal closes, Orbital will operate as its own business segment within Northrop, at least at first, said Mr. Bush.As a whole, the defense industry has undergone some major changes recently, and this deal comes soon after another huge acquisition: United Technologies’ (UTX  -  Free Report) $30 billion purchase of Rockwell Collins (COL  -  Free Report).

1036,NOC,"This week brings us the latest Federal Market Open Committee (FOMC) two-day meeting, where Fed presidents from regions across the U.S. meet with Fed Chair Janet Yellen to discuss and decide on monetary policy. The participants convene tomorrow, and by Wednesday afternoon we look forward to a press conference with Yellen regarding any changes being made.Literally no one expects another rate hike this time around, but most analysts are looking toward a table set for unwinding the Fed’s $4.5 trillion on its balance sheet. Formerly, some had expected interest rates to rise further before the unwinding program was to begin; language used by the Fed in its recent meetings, however, give a clearer indication of how important the Fed members find this unwinding to be.There is an entire cottage industry dedicated to parsing phrases and changes to previous statements the Fed makes, and this week there is new material many will be interested in seeing whether the Fed will draw from. In short, these new findings are calling the current market among the most expensive — if not the most expensive — in history. A prominent strategist at Deutsche Bank (DB  -  Free Report) points out that an equal-weighted bond/equity portfolio has never been pricier. Morgan Stanley’s (MS  -  Free Report) Ruchir Sharma points out this is the first time we see all assets — from housing to stocks to bonds — at their highest levels of expense simultaneously.According to other reports, the market is valued at four times the real economy. We appear to be at stretching points seen in both 2000 and 2007 — the years directly preceding the two most recent major market crashes. And if it stands to reason that bubbles risks increase the longer low interest rates exist, then we may at very least see more of the Fed’s conversation take up this subject. Will the Fed begin to focus more on financial stability than merely its dual mandate of low unemployment and manageable inflation?One half of that dual mandate has been met for awhile now, but the other — inflation approaching 2% — has remained elusive, among low-to-no wage growth in the domestic labor market. Weekly metrics tracking inflation have remained frustrating to economists, demonstrating inflation creep only in fits and starts. No sooner do narratives about real traction for inflation seem to appear than new data points wipe away much of what’s asserted with a regressive swing the other direction.That all said, the market continues to look for new all-time highs this week. Global growth, the cooling of tensions on the Pacific Rim and even Washington DC, better-than-expected outcomes from two major hurricanes and better-than-expected growth metrics in things like the Empire State Index have all contributed to the very bullish climate. The Fed has an opportunity to throw something of a wet blanket on this hot market, but perhaps doing so will assist in preventing the next crash, or at least keeping it from being too painful.Northrop Grumman Buys Orbital ATKDefense giant Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report) has announced it will acquire rocket propulsion and munitions manufacturing company Orbital ATK  for $7.8 billion in cash. This amounts to roughly $134.50 plus debt, and has sent OA shares up nearly 20% on the news. Though the North Korea headlines seem to have ebbed lately, it would seem Northrop is looking to benefit from Orbital’s expertise in missile launch and weapons technology. The deal is expected to close in Q1 2018.

1037,NOC,"The defense industry has experienced quite the boom since President Donald Trump took office. Back in February, he initially unveiled plans to significantly increase federal spending related to national security, seeking $54 billion to spend on a variety of defense-related systems and stoking a rally in defense stocks.Then there’s the multi-billion-dollar arms deal reached in May with Saudi Arabia. The transaction was a way to both improve a decades-long alliance with the world’s largest oil exporter, as well as potentially lead to additional sales to other countries in the region. Defense giants like Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report)—whose technology was part of the agreement—Boeing (BA  -  Free Report), and Raytheon (RTN  -  Free Report) will all likely benefit.And recently, the industry has undergone a small wave of consolidation. United Technologies (UTX  -  Free Report) announced a major $30 billion deal to acquire Rockwell Collins (COL  -  Free Report), creating one of the world’s largest aircraft-equipment manufactures. Not long after, Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report) said it would be buying Orbital ATK  in order to expand and increase its defense footprint; Orbital notably holds a contract with NASA to resupply the International Space Station with its Antares rocket.As defense stocks and funds like the iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF (ITA  -  Free Report) continue to gain this year, let’s take a look at three top picks for your portfolio.Engility Holdings Inc.

Looking ahead, Engility expects year-over-year earnings growth of nearly 40% for the current year, with three positive revisions in the last 60 days. Sales, however, are expected to dip about 5% in the same time frame, but should bounce back by next fiscal year.Shares of EGL have had a quiet 2017 so far, but the company sits in a strong industry; Aerospace-Defense is in the top 23% of all industries ranked by Zacks, and has returned well over 38% year-to-date. Engility reports its next quarterly earnings in early November.Northrop Grumman Corp.Northrop Grumman provides innovative solutions in systems integration, defense electronics, and information technology for the U.S. and international militaries, government and commercial customers, as a prime contractor, principal subcontractor, team member, or preferred supplier. Northrop is headquartered in Falls Church, Virginia.Sitting at a #2 (Buy) on the Zacks Rank, Northrop has started off strong in 2017. Both its earnings and revenue figures for the second quarter surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, and it looks like the rest of the year will continue to see improved growth.

1038,NOC,"Defense prime Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) Space Systems business unit secured a modification contract for new procurement of Trident II (D5) missile production, D5 life extension production and D5 deployed systems support. Work related to this deal is expected to be over by Sep 30, 2022.Details of the DealValued at $418.7 million, the contract has been awarded by the Strategic Systems Programs, Washington, D.C. It includes base items and all option items, which if exercised, will enhance the total value of the modification to $1.1 billion.Per the terms of the agreement, majority of the work will be executed in Sunnyvale, CA and Cape Canaveral, FL. The remaining part will be carried out at different other regions of the United States.Fiscal 2017 weapons procurement (Navy) and United Kingdom funds will be utilized to complete the task.A Brief Note on Trident II (D5)Trident II (D5) is the latest generation of submarine-launched fleet ballistic missiles, developed and produced by Lockheed Martin. It was first deployed in 1990 and is currently aboard the OHIO-class and British VANGUARD-class submarines.Markedly, these missiles are equipped with multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicles (MIRV) and thermonuclear warheads.What’s Favoring Lockheed?Lockheed Martin’s Space Systems unit is the prime contractor of the Navy's Trident missile. The company supplies technical and logistical support at sites where the missiles are deployed.In September 2016, the Navy launched an unarmed Trident II D5 Fleet Ballistic Missile, following which Lockheed Martin announced that it is building on a 60-year partnership with the Navy. The declaration was made to ensure that the missile system remains capable for decades through the company’s shared robust flight test plan.Going forward, we expect the latest contract to substantially boost the company’s growth trajectory.  Also, the defense prime remains confident of winning more of such contracts in the near term, given that Trident II (D5) is one of the most advanced U.S. Navy’s missile system.Price MovementLockheed Martin’s stock has returned 29.4% in the last one year, underperforming the 50.5% rally of the industry it belongs to. This may have been caused by the company’s F-35 program, which despite being a prime project of the U.S. government has been repeatedly criticised for being overtly expensive. Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderLockheed Martin carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks in the aerospace and defense sector include Engility Holdings, Inc. (EGL  -  Free Report), Leidos Holdings, Inc. (LDOS  -  Free Report) and Northrop Grumman Corp.

1039,NOC,"Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report) has once again declared a hike in its quarterly dividend to reward its valuable investors. Per the latest hike, the company will pay a dividend of $2.00 per share in the fourth quarter of 2017, reflecting a 10% rise from the previous dividend of $1.82. This will result in annualized dividend worth $8.00 and the consequent dividend yield of 2.6%, based on its current price of $310.29.Interestingly, this hike marks the 15th year in a row when this defense prime has increased its quarterly dividend rate by 10% or more. On Dec 29, 2017 management will pay the surged dividend to its shareholders of record as of the close of business on Dec 1, 2017.The Raised Share Repurchase PlanUnder Lockheed Martin’s current program, it has recently authorized additional share repurchase of $2 billion, thus bringing the company’s total authorization value to $4 billion for future share repurchases.Notably, during the six months that ended on Jun 25, 2017, Lockheed Martin repurchased 3.8 million shares of its common stock for $1 billion. At that time the company was left with a share repurchase authorization of $2.5 billion.Our ViewCertainly, the aforementioned announcements made by Lockheed Martin are indicative of its strong capital structure. In fact, a meticulous study of the company’s recent cash flow statement reveals the generous amount of cash this defense major generates. Also, it justifies the fact that huge demand for Lockheed Martin’s industry-leading combat equipments have made it the largest defense contractor in the United States.During the second quarter, Lockheed Martin generated cash from operations worth $1.54 billion, up 4.8% year over year. Again, the company bought back 1.9 million of shares for $500 million. Markedly, with about $278 million in capital expenditures in the reported quarter, it had $1.3 billion of free cash flow at the quarter-end. Also, the company paid dividends of $525 million and returned 81% of free cash flow to its stockholders. This in turn reflects Lockheed Martin’s strong cash deployment strategy.Based on Lockheed Martin’s strong financial position and the several major contracts that it has been winning, we expect the company’s shareholders to witness similar dividend hikes, going forward.Price PerformanceLockheed Martin’s stock has rallied 28.5% in the last year, underperforming the broader industry’s gain of 49.3%. This could be because the earlier budget cuts have put pressure on the company’s top line growth.Zacks Rank &Stocks to ConsiderLockheed Martin carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks in the aerospace and defense space include Engility Holdings, Inc. (EGL  -  Free Report), Leidos Holdings, Inc. (LDOS  -  Free Report) and Northrop Grumman Corp.

1040,NOC,"Defense giant, Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 26, before the opening bell. Being one of the largest U.S. defense contractors, it enjoys a strong presence in the U.S. Air Force, Space and Cyber Security programs.In the prior quarter, the company reported a positive earnings surprise of 25.17%. It is worth noting that Northrop Grumman has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average positive surprise being 10.87%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for the company prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderNorthrop Grumman’s better-than-expected first-quarter results demonstrated improved segment operating income, supported by strong sales growth and solid program performance. Similar outperformance can be expected in the soon-to-be-reported second quarter’s results as well.The company consistently follows a stable capital deployment strategy. In line with this, during the second quarter, Northrop Grumman hiked its quarterly dividend by 11%, bringing the annualized payout to $4 per share. This reflected the strong balance sheet and steady cash flow position that the company boasts. This, in turn, offers it substantial financial flexibility to invest in business and scope for incremental dividends.Further, the company won a handful of notable contracts in the second quarter. These include the $303.9 million modification deal for procurement of three low-rate initial production of second lot’s MQ-4C Triton unmanned aircraft, the $243.9 million contract for providing 72 Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radars and spares, and the foreign military sales (FMS) deal worth $179 million for providing hardware for large aircraft infrared counter measures (LAIRCM) and necessary support related to it. Such contracts will surely get reflected in terms of Northrop Grumman’s solid revenue growth in the second quarter and beyond.Moreover, the company identified a growing list of domestic and international opportunities across its businesses. This comprises the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent program,MQ-25 unmanned aerial system, new Space programs and a variety of international opportunities for Autonomous Systems as well as upgrading Lockheed Martin’s F-16 jets with its SABR Radar. It also includes additional international opportunities pursued by its Technology Services segment in the Middle East and Australia.  Further updates on these opportunities can be expected once Northrop Grumman reports its second-quarter results.On the flip side, the company continues to witness lower sales volume for its KC-10 program, which dragged down its revenue from Technology Services in the first quarter. With no improvement anticipated soon in this issue, we expect the second-quarter results to reflect a similar sales decline for the segment.For the second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $2.84 per share, up 9.32% year over year, while the revenue estimate of $6.21 billion implies a 3.57% year-over-year improvement.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Northrop Grumman is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Northrop Grumman has an Earnings ESP of -1.06%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at $2.81, lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.84. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Northrop Grumman carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which increases the predictive power of ESP. But the company’s -1.06% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Meanwhile, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Northrop Grumman Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Northrop Grumman Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Northrop Grumman Corporation QuoteStocks that Warrant a LookHere are some defense companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc.

The company has an Earnings ESP of +4.96% and a Zacks Rank #2.Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report) is expected to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 27.

1042,NOC,"Defense major, Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) business segment, Rotary and Mission Systems, recently clinched a modification contract to supply fiscal 2017 AEGIS modernization production requirements. Work related to this deal is scheduled to be over by Dec 2020.Details of the DealThe contract, worth $76.6 million, was awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C. Moreover, the value of the deal can increase up to $192.3 million, if the options included in the modification are exercised.The company will utilize fiscal 2017 defense-wide procurement; 2015, 2016 and 2017 other procurement, 2012 shipbuilding and conversion, and foreign military sales funding to complete the work. Majority of the modification work will be carried out in Moorestown, NJ. The remaining tasks will be executed in Clearwater, FL and Owego, NY.What’s AEGIS?AEGIS or Advanced Electronic Guidance and Instrumentation System is an integrated missile-guidance system. With Lockheed Martin as its primary manufacturer, the AEGIS Weapons system is used by the U.S. Navy and allied ships to protect the battle group.Another company working on AEGIS is Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report). At the heart of the system is the AN/SPY-1, an advanced, automatic detect and track, multi-function phased-array radar. Raytheon is the manufacturer of this high-powered radar transmitter that tracks and guides missile functions.Over time, AEGIS has become an integral part of the U.S. Navy by evolving with new capabilities to counter emerging threats and leverage new technologies. Its latest configuration, Baseline 9, offers an open architecture framework to allow extreme flexibility.Our ViewLockheed Martin's Rotary and Mission Systems business carries out some of the company's high-profile programs. These include the Aegis Combat System, Littoral Combat Ship, MH-60 helicopter avionics, along with military and commercial orders. It generated revenues of $3.4 billion in the second quarter of 2017, reflecting almost 27% of its total revenue.Coming to order growth for this segment, the Sikorsky business line of the segment secured a $3.8 billion worth five-year contract for supplying 257 Black Hawk helicopters to the U.S. Army, as well as to the Saudi Arabian National Guard, in the second quarter.Currently, Lockheed Martin's Aegis is the maritime weapon system of choice for six powerful nations. As of Jan 2017, 84 U.S. Navy ships were in service with the AEGIS Weapons System installed. This number will definitely rise given the strong demand for AEGIS prevalent across the globe. Considering this, we expect Lockheed Martin to bag more contracts like the latest one, in days ahead, which, in turn, will boost its profitability.Price MovementLockheed Martin’s stock has returned 14% in the last one year, underperforming the 28.7% rally of the industry it belongs to. This could have been caused by the company’s F-35 program, which, despite being a prime project of the U.S. government, has been repeatedly criticised for being overtly expensive. Moreover, Lockheed Martin faces stiff competition from other defense majors like The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) and Northrop Grumman Corp.

1043,NOC,"Military shipbuilder General Dynamics Corporation’s (GD  -  Free Report) business unit, Ordnance and Tactical Systems (‘’OTS’’), secured a modification contract worth $109.2 million for procuring Hydra rockets. Work related to this deal is scheduled to be over by Mar 31, 2020.The contract has been awarded by the U.S. Army Contracting Command, Redstone Arsenal, AL. The company will carry out the procurement task at Williston, VT. Fiscal 2015, 2016 and 2017 aircraft procurement funds as well as fiscal 2015, 2016 and 2017 other funds will be utilized to complete the work.  Notably, fiscal 2010 foreign military sales funds will also be used.A Brief Note on Hydra RocketsHydra rockets, better known as Hydra-70, represent a family of 2.75-inch unguided rockets that offer several warhead configurations. They can be used for point and area targets. The missiles are part of a lethal yet lightweight weapon system with multi-mission capability like anti-material, anti-personnel, air-to-ground suppression and illumination.The rocket system can be installed on most of the rotary and fixed-wing aircraft. Incidentally, it is the most commonly used helicopter-launched weapon system in the world.Our ViewWith the meteoric rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) over the last few years and more developing nations increasing their share of defense spending, the global market for defense equipment has been on growth trajectory. This, in turn, has provided a solid impetus to sales in the U.S. Aerospace-Defense industry, with the nation being the largest weapon supplier.Being one of the major players in the defense business, General Dynamics boasts a diverse product and service portfolio along with a wide customer base. In North America, the company maintains a market-leading position in the supply of Hydra-70 rockets, in munitions space. Thanks to the significant demand for this high-end rocket system, General Dynamics has produced more than four million Hydra-70 rockets since 1996. The latest modification contract indicates this production number to increase substantially in coming days, which in turn will boost the company’s growth trajectory.According to a recent report by Transparency Market Research, the global rockets and missiles market is expected to reach a value worth $43 billion by 2025, reflecting a CAGR of 3.2% from 2016.

1045,NOC,"On Jul 20, 2017, we updated a research report on Embraer SA (ERJ  -  Free Report), a company that designs, manufactures and sells aircraft and aviation-related structural parts, to the world’s commercial aviation, executive aviation as well as defense markets. It is one of the leaders in the commercial aircraft space with a seating capacity of up to 130, and has produced over 5000 jets so far.Notably, Embraer continues to lead the 70- to 130-seat commercial jet market. Commercial Aviation revenues represented 62% of the company’s total revenue in the first quarter, up from 54.3% last year.Furthermore, the company has a series of healthy contracts and tie-ups with other companies for its jets. It also continues to witness strong demand for its E-jets, which resulted in booking of several orders for the company in the first quarter of 2017. Evidently, Embraer received order for additional four E175 from American airlines.Going forward, the company sees more room for growth given the rising air traffic. In its 20-year Market Outlook, the company stated that it expects total market deliveries of 6,400 jets, which include 2,300 units in the 70- to 90-seat segment and 4,100 units in the 90- to 130-seat segment by 2035.In addition, the 70- to 130-seat jet world fleet-in-service, the fastest growing among all aircraft seat segments, will increase from 2,670 aircraft in 2015 to 6,690 by 2035. While replacement of ageing aircraft will represent about 37% of new deliveries, 63% of deliveries will represent market growth. Embraer has a strong presence in this segment and is therefore likely to witness significant top-line growth.On the flip side, Embraer requires to invest steadily in technology and performance enhancement to meet growing demand in the aircraft manufacturing market. This is because it operates in a highly competitive commercial aircraft manufacturing industry dominated by two companies – The Boeing Co. (BA  -  Free Report) and Airbus Group SE (EADSY  -  Free Report) – with a long operating history as well as an established reputation.Again, orders for the company's new airplanes from its global customers depend on the economic condition of those countries, trade barriers in foreign markets and prevailing credit conditions in international financial markets. Domestically, Brazil’s economic woes along with a series of populist tax incentives have put pressure on the government's finances. Also, Embraer is exposed to foreign currency fluctuations.Price MovementShares of Embraer have lost 4.4% in the last one year against the industry's gain of 28.7%. This underperformance could have been caused by the weakening Brazilian real against the U.S. dollar. Additionally, the softness observed in the company’s Defense and Security business remains a concern.Zacks Rank & Stock to ConsiderEmbraer currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). A better-ranked stock in the same space is Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC  -  Free Report) holding a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Northrop Grumman surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last four quarters with an average positive surprise of 10.87%. Furthermore, the company's 2017 earnings estimates climbed 4.6% to $12.37, in the last 90 days.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

1048,NOC,"The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) recently won a $34.4-million modification contract for providing F/A-18A-F and EA-18G aircraft’s integrated product support and equipment engineering services. The services will be rendered to the Navy and the governments of Australia, Finland, Kuwait, Malaysia, Switzerland, Canada, and Spain.  Details of the DealPer the contract, Boeing will offer product support management, design interfacing, sustaining engineering, supply support, maintenance planning and provisioning, technical data updates, support equipment engineering as well as training and software integration services. The deal was awarded by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, Maryland.Majority of the work will be carried out in St. Louis, MI, while the rest would be performed in El Segundo, CA; Bethpage, NY and San Diego, CA. Work related to the deal is schedule to be completed in December 2018. The company will use Fiscal 2018 aircraft procurement (Navy) and foreign military sales funds will be utilized to finance the task.Under the Foreign Military Sales program, the U.S. Navy will procure 85% of the contract value whereas the government of Australia would account for 9% of the same in order to get the work started. Government of Finland, Kuwait, Malaysia, Switzerland, Canada, and Spain will each get 1% of its total value.A Brief Note on F/A-18 and E/A-18Boeing’s F/A-18 Block III Super Hornet is a twin-engine, supersonic, all weather multirole fighter jet. The U.S. Navy’s tactical and air superiority aircraft is capable of performing virtually every mission in the tactical spectrum, including air superiority, day/night strike with precision-guided weapons, fighter escort, close air support, suppression of enemy air defenses, maritime strike, reconnaissance, forward air control and tanker missions.Boeing’s EA-18G Growler is the most advanced airborne electronic attack  platform which operates from either an aircraft carrier or from land bases. The aircraft helps combat electronic attack and suppresses enemy air defences, particularly at the start and at early stages of on-going hostilities. The Growler aircraft has 11 weapon stations for carrying electronic mission systems and weapons and can then be used to carry out conventional strike missions. The major contractor Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report) manufactures the rear and centre fuselage sections and is responsible for the manufacture of the structural components.What’s Favoring Boeing?Boeing is one of the major players in the defense business and stands out among its peers by virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and solid backlog. Its defense segment, known as Boeing Defense, Space & Security (“BDS”), witnessed an approximate 5% year-over-year increase in fourth-quarter 2017 revenues to $5.54 billion, driven by higher weapons deliveries. Boeing's backlog at BDS stood at $50 billion, 40% of which comprised orders from international clients. In particular, among other defense equipment, the company’s key forte has been combat-proven aircraft. Notably, with its proven expertise in aerospace programs, Boeing has been winning a huge number of contracts from the Pentagon for long.Inevitably, Boeing has been witnessing strong demand for its fighter aircrafts and major aerospace programs, including the F-18 and EA-18 aircrafts. This was evidenced by the delivery of the 150th EA-18G Growler to the U.S. Navy along with $10 billion of new orders booked during the last quarter. We believe the latest contract reflects this that Boeing’s jet fighters enjoy in the global market.Meanwhile, last month, President Trump proposed fiscal 2019 defense budget that provisions for major war fighting investments of $21.7 billion for aircrafts. Boeing, being the largest aircraft manufacturer in the United States, will surely be a significant beneficiary from the proposed budget, which further includes an investment plan of $2 billion for procuring 24 F/A-18 aircrafts. Such proposed inclusions reflect solid growth prospects for BDS segment, which in turn are likely to boost the company’s profit margin.Price MovementBoeing’s stock has rallied about 81.1 % in a year, compared with the broader industry’s gain of 44.4%. The outperformance was primarily led by significant demand for its military jets along with robust worldwide demand for its commercial aircraft. Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to Consider    Boeing currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).A few other top-ranked stocks in the same sector are Huntington Ingalls (HII  -  Free Report) and Curtiss-Wright Corporation (CW  -  Free Report), each flaunting a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Huntington Ingalls recorded an average positive earnings surprise of 3.85% in the last four quarters.

1049,NOC,"The S&P 500 index was down more than 1.5% in early afternoon trading Monday as Facebook’s (FB  -  Free Report) steep declines dragged tech stocks lower, triggering sell alerts and causing volatility to prevail as the trading week kicked off.Facebook’s slump is attributable to reports that emerged during the weekend linking the social media behemoth to questionable activity from political consultancy Cambridge Analytica.This data analysis company, which worked on Facebook ads for President Trump’s 2016 campaign, allegedly mishandled the personal information of about 50 million Facebook users, underscoring concerns about security and abuse within internet advertising.Morning volatility inspired by Facebook’s selloff was exacerbated as investors remembered several similar moments of panic over the past few months and ditched stocks accordingly. The broad S&P 500 sunk as much as 2% to hit an intraday low of 2,696.43.Nevertheless, several notable S&P companies remained in the green through early afternoon trading, desperately attempting to keep the index afloat on the day. Check out why a few of these stocks were able to fight that battle on Monday!Gap Inc. (GPS  -  Free Report)Shares of Gap were up about 1.4% through early afternoon hours Monday. The retailer has had an up-and-down few weeks after reporting its latest quarterly financial results at the beginning of the month, but it looks like investors might finally be looking to reward the company for its impressive numbers.Just a few weeks ago, Gap notched adjusted earnings of 61 cents per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 59 cents per share. Total revenues in the quarter touched $4.8 billion, up about 8% year over year and ahead of our consensus estimate of $4.7 billion. Meanwhile, comps growth of 5% marked the retailer’s fifth-consecutive quarter of positive results in this key category.Since then, we have witnessed 13 positive analyst revisions for Gap’s full-year EPS estimates. The stock is now sporting a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC  -  Free Report)Shares of defense contractor Northrop Grumman moved about 1.2% higher in afternoon trading after the company secured a 10-year extension of its information technology services for the Social Security Administration. The new contract comes just two weeks after Northrop inked a $475 million deal to upgrade missile defense systems throughout the U.S.We have witnessed six positive revisions for Northrup’s full-year earnings estimates versus three negative revisions within the past 60 days. The stock remains a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Signet Jewelers Ltd. (SIG  -  Free Report)Signet shares were up more than 2.2% in early afternoon hours Monday, just a few trading periods after the jewelry retailer’s latest earnings report date. Last week, said that it saw quarterly revenues of $2.3 billion, up 1% year over year and slightly above our consensus estimates. Meanwhile, adjusted earnings of $4.28 per share came in two cents ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Nevertheless, Signet sold off nearly 20% in the immediate aftermath of its report. Today’s gains are a slight bounce from its post-earnings lows, signaling that investors might be willing to jump back in at a discount.Want more market analysis from this author?

1050,NOC,"Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) Space Systems business unit recently secured a modification contract for providing deployment system support to Trident II (D5) missile. Work related to this deal is scheduled to be over by Sep 30, 2022.Valued at $71.6 million, the contract was awarded by the Strategic Systems Programs, Washington, D.C. Majority of the work will be carried out in Cape Canaveral, FL; Sunnyvale, CA and Magna, UT; while the rest will be executed at various other locations across the United States. The contract will utilize fiscal 2018 as well as fiscal 2017 weapons procurement, research, development, test, and evaluation funds to complete the task.A Brief Note on Trident II (D5)Trident II (D5) is the latest generation of submarine-launched fleet ballistic missiles, developed and produced by Lockheed Martin. It was first deployed in 1990 and is currently aboard the OHIO-class and British VANGUARD-class submarines.These missiles are equipped with multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicles and thermonuclear warheads.What’s Favoring Lockheed Martin?Lockheed Martin’s Space Systems unit is the prime contractor of the Navy's Trident missile. The company supplies technical and logistical support at sites where the missiles are deployed.Notably, the Trident II D5 Fleet Ballistic Missile is a program with the U.S. Navy for the only submarine-launched intercontinental ballistic missile currently in production in the United States.With frequent missile threats that the United States has been receiving from North Korea, in past few months, a subsequent rise in contracts from Pentagon related to enhancement of the nation’s missile security has been observed. In particular missile-makers Raytheon Company as well as Lockheed Martin has been winning ample orders to this end.Given Trident II (D5) is one of the most advanced U.S. Navy’s missile system, Lockheed Martin has been securing valuable contracts for this product, like the one worth $419 million it won last month. This, along with the latest contract win, is expected to boost the company’s Space Systems business.Moreover, the fiscal 2018 defense policy has authorized the United States to spend $700 billion on defense. This has further enhanced the prospect of increased order flow from Pentagon for major defense contractors like Lockheed Martin, The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report), Northrop Grumman Corp (NOC  -  Free Report) and Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report).Price MovementLockheed Martin’s stock has moved up about 14.1% in last six months compared with the broader industry’s gain of 19.6%. This underperformance could have been caused by the intense competition that the company faces for its broad portfolio of products and services domestically as well as internationally.  Zacks Rank Lockheed Martin carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

The deal will serve the U.S. Air Force, Marine Corps, Navy, non-U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) participants and foreign military sales (FMS) customers.Per the modification, the long lead material and parts will be acquired for 145 of the 13th Lot of F-35 jet for the Services, non-U.S. DoD participants and FMS customers, and for 69 of the 14th Lot of the aircraft for the non-U.S. DoD participants and FMS customers.Majority of the work will be executed in Fort Worth, TX; El Segundo, CA; Warton, United Kingdom and Orlando, FL. The deal includes 24% of the work for the Air Force; 11% for the Marine Corps, 3% for the Navy, 44% for the non-U.S. DoD participants and 18% for international partners.Notably, fiscal 2017 advanced procurement (Navy and Air Force), fiscal 2017 aircraft procurement (Marine Corps), non-U.S. DoD participant and FMS funds will be utilized to complete the project.F-35 AttributesLockheed Martin’s F-35 Lightning II is a single-seat, single-engine 5th Generation fighter aircraft, which comes with an advanced stealth feature combined with enhanced fighter speed and agility, fully fused sensor information, network-enabled operations and advanced sustainment. Three variants of F-35 are set to replace five fighter jets for the U.S. Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps as well as a variety of fighter jets for at least 10 other countries.With Lockheed Martin being the primary partner, the F-35 program has been supported by an international team of leading aerospace majors. In this regard, Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report) rendered its expertise in carrier aircraft and low-observable stealth technology to this program. Also, BAE Systems’ (BAESY  -  Free Report) short takeoff and vertical landing experience as well as air systems sustainment supported the jet’s combat capabilities. Moreover, Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies (UTX  -  Free Report), provides F-35s with the F135 propulsion system, which is the world's most powerful fighter engine.Recent DevelopmentsThe F-35 program is Lockheed Martin’s largest program, which generated 25% of its total net sales and 64% of Aeronautics division’s revenues in 2017. Evidently, the company’s top line grew 12% in the fourth quarter at its Aeronautics segment, primarily driven by the F-35 program.Meanwhile, Lockheed Martin enjoys a steady flow of contracts from the Pentagon each year and 2018 is also no exception. Last month, the company won a delivery contract worth $159 million for this program. In the same month, it also secured a $148 million deal for designing and development of the program to support the Israel government. Considering these contract wins, we may expect the Aeronautics unit to reflect similar solid performance in the first quarter of 2018 as well.Moreover, production of F-35 is expected to continue for many years, given the U.S. government’s current inventory objective of 2,456  aircraft for the Air Force, Marine Corps and Navy; commitments from the company’s eight international partners and three international customers as well as expressions of interest from other countries.Additionally, Trump recently proposed fiscal 2019 defense budget that provisions for a spending plan of $21.7 billion on Aircraft. In particular, the budget proposal hints at an increase in Lockheed Martin’s F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program and has allotted $10.7 billion for procurement of 77 F-35 Joint Strike Fighters. These developments reflect solid growth prospects for Lockheed Martin’s F-35 program, which in turn are likely to boost the company’s profit margin.Price PerformanceShares of Lockheed Martin have rallied about 27.3% in a year compared with the broader industry’s gain of 48.1%. This underperformance might have been caused by intense competition that the company faces for its broad portfolio of products and services in domestic and international markets.Zacks Rank Lockheed Martin carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1052,NOC,"Northrop Grumman Corp.’s (NOC  -  Free Report) Northrop Grumman Systems Corp. unit recently secured a modification contract worth $255.3 million for low-rate initial production (LRIP) of three MQ-4C Triton unmanned aircraft from the 3rd Lot. Per the terms of the deal, the company will manufacture trade studies and tooling to support the Persistent Maritime Unmanned Aircraft Systems Program Office.Details of the DealThe contract was awarded by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, Maryland. Majority of the work will be carried out in San Diego, CA; Baltimore, MD; Red Oak, TX and Palmdale, CA. The remaining work will be executed in other locations in the United States.Northrop Grumman will utilize fiscal 2018 aircraft procurement (Navy) funds to complete the work by December 2021.A Brief Note on MQ-4C TritonMQ-4C Triton unmanned aircraft system (UAS) provides real-time intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) over vast ocean and coastal regions.Based on the proven Global Hawk UAS, Triton is equipped with a unique and robust mission sensor suite that provides 360-degree coverage on all sensors. These sensors offer unprecedented maritime domain awareness for the U.S. Navy.Built for the U.S. Navy, Triton supports a wide range of missions including maritime ISR patrol, signals intelligence, search and rescue and communications relay. The aircraft can fly over 24 hours at a time, at altitudes higher than 10 miles, with an operational range of 8,200 nautical miles.Our ViewWith increasing security threats across the globe, nations are consistently boosting their arsenal. In November 2017, the U.S. Navy announced plans to deploy Triton to NAS Mayport, Florida, NAS Sigonella, Italy and the Middle East. Toward this end, the department has placed an order for 68 Triton aircraft, which we believe will enable Northrop Grumman to generate higher revenues.During the third quarter of 2017, Northrop Grumman’s Aerospace Systems sales increased a solid 10.8%, driven by manned aircraft as well as autonomous systems like Triton. We believe strong order flow for Triton will boost this segment’s growth.With the current U.S. administration in favor of huge defense spending, extensive revenue generation from the Triton program reflecting significant demand as well as latest contract wins from Pentagon, we expect Northrop Grumman to achieve its financial targets.Price MovementNorthrop Grumman’s stock has moved up about 29.9% in a year, compared with the broader industry’s gain of 42.7%. The stock performance might have been hurt by intense competition in domestic and international markets. Zacks Rank & Key PicksNorthrop Grumman carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks from the same sector are Curtiss-Wright Corporation (CW  -  Free Report), Leidos Holdings, Inc.

1054,NOC,"Defense bellwether Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT  -  Free Report) recently secured a modification contract for procuring C-130J multi-year production aircraft for the U.S. Coast Guard. Work related to the deal is scheduled to be over by Apr 30, 2020.Valued at $61.9 million, the contract was awarded by the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, OH. The company will utilize fiscal 2017 Coast Guard aircraft procurement funds to execute the task at Marietta, GA.A Brief Note on C-130JC-130J Super Hercules, the latest model in Lockheed Martin’s Hercules family, is a four-engine, turboprop, military transport aircraft. The C-130J's crew includes just two pilots and one loadmaster, since no navigator or flight engineer is required on the aircraft. Among its missions, the C-130J counts capabilities as diverse as special ops, aerial refueling, close air support, search and rescue and personal recovery.The J-model is almost similar to the classic Hercules in terms of general appearance. However, it uses updated technology like the new Rolls-Royce AE 2100 D3 turboprops from Rolls-Royce Holdings plc (RYCEY  -  Free Report) that comes with the Dowty R391 composite scimitar propellers, digital avionics and reduced crew requirements. These improvements have boosted its performance over C-130E/H predecessors. In particular, the improved J-model comes with 40% greater range, 21% higher speed and 41% reduced take-off distance.Our ViewLockheed Martin is the largest U.S. defense contractor with a platform-centric focus that guarantees a steady inflow of follow-on orders from a leveraged presence in the Army, Air Force, Navy and IT programs. Its Aeronautics business division is engaged in the production and upgradation of advanced military aircraft, including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles and related technologies. Notably, C-130J is one of the major Aeronautics programs of the company as well as of the U.S. Air Force.In 2016, Lockheed Martin delivered 24 C-130J aircraft, of which five were offered to international customers. As of Dec 31, 2016, the company had 88 of these aircraft in its backlog, a number we believe will increase in the coming days, courtesy of the recently won deal. Given the growing demand that the company has been witnessing from overseas market for this tactical aircraft of late, in particular from France and Israel, we can expect it to fetch more similar contracts involving its C-130J jets in the days ahead.Interestingly, in its latest quarterly results, the company’s Aeronautics division witnessed  revenue growth of 19%, partially driven by higher sales volume from C-130J program. Looking forward, for 2017, the company has raised its outlook for this segment’s operating profit by $20 million. Undoubtedly, the recently won deal has advanced Lockheed Martin a step ahead in successfully achieving this target. With more similar deals expected in the future, the C-130J program can be considered as one of the growth drivers for the company.Price MovementLockheed Martin’s stock has returned 26.9% in the last year, underperforming the 41.8% rally of the industry it belongs to. This might have been caused by the company’s F-35 program, which, despite being a prime project of the U.S. government, has been repeatedly criticised for being overtly expensive, over last year. Moreover, Lockheed Martin faces stiff competition from other defense majors like The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) and Northrop Grumman Corp.

1055,NOC,"Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) Aeronautics business division recently secured a contract for offering comprehensive F-22 air vehicle sustainment.  Work related to this deal is scheduled to get over by Dec 31, 2027.Details of the DealValued at $7 billion, this contract was awarded by the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Hill Air Force Base, UH. The deal includes five-year base ordering period. Fiscal 2018 operations and maintenance funds will be used to partially finance the task.Work will be performed at five operational bases and six support locations situated across various parts of the United States as well as overseas locations, combat deployment and enroute support bases, potential locations through depot partnering agreements, and system program office locations.A Brief Note on F-22Lockheed Martin’s F-22 Raptor is the fifth-generation, single-seat, twin-engine, all-weather stealth tactical fighter aircraft with a unique combination of stealth, speed, agility and situational awareness along with lethal long-range air-to-air and air-to-ground weaponry.However, high development costs, ban on exports and development of the more versatile F-35 aircraft led to the discontinuation of F-22 production few years back. Nevertheless, the company’s F-22 team remains committed to provide full support for Follow-on Agile Sustainment, a comprehensive weapons management program. This award-winning performance-based logistics contract offers a highly integrated F-22 support system.What's Favoring Lockheed Martin?Of late, there has been a rapid increase in terrorist activities across the globe. With radical institutions having an easy access to weapons and North Korea consistently sending missile threats to the continental regions of the United States, America is leaving no stone unturned to develop  tactical weaponries base.Pentagon being the prime defense contractor, Lockheed Martin enjoys a lion’s share of the aerospace-defense industry in the United States. Naturally, the number of contracts it wins from Pentagon is also noteworthy. Moreover, the recent budgetary amendments in the country have favored defense giants like Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics Corp (GD  -  Free Report), Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC  -  Free Report) and The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report), among others.In particular, in September 2017, the U.S. Senate approved the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal 2018, worth $700 billion, include funding for various defense programs. This has been a primary factor which is expected to rake in more orders for the defense majors in the long run.During the third-quarter earnings call, Lockheed Martin’s management increased outlook for 2017 profit for Aeronautics, Space Systems and Missiles and Fire Control by $35 million, reflecting both improved performance and higher volumes. We believe significant contract wins like the latest one will substantially help the company achieve this increased profit target.Price PerformanceLockheed Martin’s stock has returned 25.4% in last 12 months, underperforming the 42.8% rally of the industry it belongs to. This underperformance was mostly led by intense competition that the company faces in the domestic and international markets. Zacks Rank Lockheed Martin currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

It was designed and built by Raytheon. The company has also provided operations support and maintenance over the time.Moving Forward with Strong PerformanceRaytheon has a wide range of combat-proven defense product which helps it in securing scrumptious orders from both Pentagon as well as foreign allies of the nation. The company wins regular contracts from various sources, both domestic and international. About 34.7% of the company’s total booking during the second quarter was international booking, marking an increase of 2.4% year over year. Thanks to its strong performance, the company reported better-than-expected earnings during the second quarter of the year.Notably, the defense scenario across the world at present, demands for new and innovative weapon which and defend a country and if the situation arises can help it in fighting too.

1061,NOC,"Aircraft giant, The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report), recently announcedthatTurkish Airlines intends to purchase 40 787-9 Dreamliners. Thisrepresents demand for long-haul aircraft amid declining orders for many wide-body models.If finalized, this agreement will getreflected on the Boeing’s orders and deliveries website.According to Bloomberg, the 40 planes are estimated to be valued atapproximately $11 billion at list prices. But it goes without saying that the airlines will enjoy a substantial discount on this amount.Apart from this, Boeing and the Turkish government announced the Boeing Turkey National Aerospace Initiative. This initiative is designed to support the growth of the Turkish aerospace industry, in line with the targets set by Turkey's Vision 2023. It will also strengthen Boeing's presence in the Turkish market.787-9 FleetBoeing’s 787-9 Dreamliner jet represents one of the latest models of the company’s family of superefficient 787 jets, offering more seats and cargo capability than its previous versions. With the fuselage stretched by 6 meters (20 feet) over the 787-8 model, the 787-9 comes with 20% less fuel use and 20% fewer emissions than other aircraft of similar size.Leveraging the visionary design of the 787-8, the 787-9 jet promises to offer passenger-pleasing features such as large windows, large stow bins, modern LED lighting, higher humidity, a lower cabin altitude, cleaner air and a smoother ride.Till yesterday from its launch of 787-9 mode, Boeing received orders for 675 aircraft from various airline operator across the globe.Our ViewWe would like to remind investors that, despite facing several headwinds from the very beginning of its inception, the 787 family of jets has remained one of the crucial centrepieces of Boeing’s commercial aircraft business line.Evidently, per the company’s second quarter 2017 results, Boeing has made notable progress on the 787 program. Also, it announced lately that the company will increase its production rate for this program to 14 per month in 2019.Markedly, Turkish Airlineshas been a long-standing customer of Boeing that spans over 70 years. The companies are nowtaking their collaboration to the next level, which will accelerate growth of the Turkish aerospace industry while achieving Boeing's long-term objective to expand its presence in the marketplace.Going forward, Boeing’s 787 jets will empower the airlines to operate in any place in Europe and some destinations in the United States. In fact, deal for 787-9s is expected to open up more number of global routes for the carrier, thereby encouraging it to buy more of Boeing’s aircraft and bring in more revenues for the aircraft major.Encouraging Q2 Order DetailsA quick sneak peek into the company’s latestorder details further boosts investors’ optimism in the stock. Evidently, in the first half of 2017, Boeing booked 381 net commercial orders. On the contrary, the company’s arch rival, Airbus Group SE (EADSY  -  Free Report) registered net bookings of just 203 aircraft in the same period, thus trailing far behind.Being the two largest players in the commercial aircraft space, Boeing and Airbus faces intensifying competition in the Aerospace industry. Nevertheless, Boeing’s huge order growth have recently placed it in a better position in the industry, and orders like the latest one will surely help it to retain that leading position.Price MovementShares of Boeing have surged 94.2% in the last 12 months, outperforming the industry’s gain of 43.3%.This could be because the company’s strong balance sheet and cash flows that provide financial flexibility in matters of incremental dividend, ongoing share repurchases and earnings accretive acquisitions.Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to ConsiderBoeing currently holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Some other top-ranked stocks in the same space include Leidos Holdings, Inc. (LDOS  -  Free Report) and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report). While Leidos Holdings sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Northrop Grumman carries the same bullish rank as Boeing.

However, this simplistic approach of only inspecting the dividend yield could be overlooking some key areas that are actually very important to consider.Chief among these are considering other financial activities, such as share repurchases or debt retirement, and the impact these data points have as well. And, if you combine all of these together, you get a much more complete picture of a company’s true yield prospects, in what is often referred to as ‘shareholder yield’.Why Shareholder Yield?To explain how and why to use this concept in a bit greater detail, we have Meb Faber, the CIO of Cambria Investments to discuss the topic with us on this week’s Dutram Report. Meb literally wrote a book on shareholder yield, so it is pretty safe to say he knows a thing or two about the concept and why it might often a more holistic approach for yield-focused investors.Meb goes over the main points of this strategy, how income investors might feel about the approach, and the ever-increasing popularity of share buybacks these days. Meb also makes the case for why this technique might be worth investigating, and the importance of free cash flow to great outcomes too.We then discuss the main way for investors to target this market in ETF form with the Shareholder Yield ETF (SYLD  -  Free Report), and how this portfolio is constructed. Top holdings right now include Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report), Green Dot (GDOT  -  Free Report), and Southwest Airlines (LUV  -  Free Report), but check out the podcast for additional information on how this actively-managed portfolio is built and maintained.The Rest of the LineupWe also talk about how this strategy works internationally. There are some important considerations to keep in mind for a foreign approach, including which countries tend to be more well-represented for this metric in their Foreign Shareholder Yield ETF (FYLD  -  Free Report), and if there are enough quality companies in the emerging world when using this technique for their Emerging Market Shareholder Yield ETF (EYLD  -  Free Report) too.Finally, we also discuss two of Cambria’s other funds, and what these might bring to the table. The company has a Tail Risk ETF (TAIL) which invests in out of the money put options to mitigate downside risks, while it also has a Core Equity ETF (CCOR) that uses options trading to produce capital appreciation. But check out the podcast for additional information on this duo, as well as the shareholder yield lineup from Cambria.Bottom LineBut what do you think about shareholder yield?

However, the revenue performance was a mixed bag (read: Aerospace and Defense ETFs Soar on U.S-Saudi Deal).Given the escalating geopolitical risks involving Syria and North Korea, demand for defense products is increasing. Moreover, airlines have been spending aggressively on renewals of their fleet worldwide. These factors are a positive for this industry and make investments in this sector an attractive option (read: ETFs to Top/Flop as Trump Lays Foundation for Future America).Earnings in FocusBoeing Company reported second-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of $2.56 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.32 and increasing from last year’s loss of $0.44 per share.

Its share price was up initially on Tuesday, July 25, 2017, owing to the better-than-expected results but closed around 2.2% lower at market close on July 25, 2017.

1068,NOC,"President Trump fired U.S. Secretary of State — Rex Tillerson — on Mar 13, by announcing his decision on Twitter. Consequently, stocks in the aerospace and defense space were on an upward trajectory in pre-market trading.Notably, Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report) gained 0.74%, Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) inched up 0.31%, Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report) rose 0.21% and Raytheon (RTN  -  Free Report) was up 0.54%, per a report by The Street.What Went Wrong With Tillerson?Tillerson’s short tenure of a year was marked by multiple public disagreements with President Trump over diverse foreign policy decisions. In fact, the discord between these two administrative stalwarts reached to such an extent that Tillerson called Trump a “moron” in a Pentagon meeting in July 2017.Notably, both Trump and Tillerson repeatedly clashed over multiple administrative agendas like — whether to stay in the Paris climate change accord, how to aggressively back the embargo against Qatar led by Saudi Arabia or whether to pursue a diplomatic solution to North Korea’s nuclear weapons program.Reportedly, Tillerson also expressed displeasure regarding Trump’s widely criticized response to a neo-Nazi protest in August 2017, which had led to a death in Charlottesville, VA. Their rift emerged more sharply when Trump tweeted in October that Tillerson is ""wasting his time"" trying to negotiate with North Korea to end its nuclear and missile programs. Markedly, Tillerson was among Trump's deputies who tried to prevent him from taking steps to scrap the Iran nuclear deal.These frequent discords led analysts to anticipate Tillerson’s departure in past few months. Now that the nation’s commander-in-chief has finally made the decision, the rocky tenure of America’s top diplomat have come to an end.How Will Tillerson’s Exit Aid Defense Stocks?Trump has suggested the name of Mike Pompeo, the CIA chief as the next secretary of state, following Tillerson’s exit.Interestingly, Mike Pompeo is a hard-line Republican who shares Trump’s combatant perspective of the world. Moreover, Pompeo was an outspoken critic of Obama's nuclear deal with Iran and Hillary Clinton's handling of the Benghazi attack. He also criticized the former National Security Agency leaker — Edward Snowden — as a traitor and wished for his death sentence.It is interesting to note that Trump’s presidency has already proved to be a boon for defense stocks, thanks to his optimistic defense-related strategies. On top of that, arrival of a combat-friendly diplomat like Pompeo serves as good news for the defense industry and thus has boosted the stocks post the news release.  Other Factors Boosting Defense StocksThere’s no denying of the fact that Trump’s presidency has proved conducive to the U.S. Aerospace and Defense space, when it was grappling with the budget sequestration act implemented by the prior government. The latest fiscal 2019 defense budget proposal depicts also depicts a favorable picture for the industry. The proposal aims at spending $716 billion on national security. Of the total, $686.1 billion is being kept as funding for the Pentagon, reflecting 5% real growth over the initial fiscal 2018 President’s budget.Apart from the budget factor, a wave of mergers has been observed between big aerospace and defense companies in a bid to fend off competition as well as expand core operations and product lines. For instance, United Technologies agreed to take over Rockwell Collins for $30 billion while Northrop Grumman is set to buy Orbital ATK for $9.2 billion. Synergies from these mega deals are sure to benefit the industry.Additionally, emerging nations like Japan and India as well as European countries are raising their defense budgets on account of the widespread geo-political uncertainties. In this context, as the United States is the largest supplier of defense equipment, it goes without saying that a golden era awaits Aerospace & Defense stocks.While selection of the secretary of state is a momentary event, inherent drivers like the aforementioned ones are likely to continue boosting the defense stocks.Stocks to BuyIn order to save investors from the time-taking process of identifying key defense winners, we have created a screen using the Zacks Stock Screener.Herein, we have zeroed in on three Aerospace & Defense stocks that  have been recording better-than-expected results and a long-term earnings growth rate of 10% or more.

1069,NOC,"Raytheon Company’s (RTN  -  Free Report) business unit, Space and Airborne Systems (SAS), recently secured a modification contract for providing supplemental service for the B-2 antenna. Moreover, the modification provides for the manufacturing of two additional B-2 antenna tool aids.The deal, valued at $39.9 million, has been awarded by the Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma City, OK. Work related to the contract will be carried out in El Segundo, CA and is scheduled to be over by Sep 7, 2021. With this modification, the total cumulative face value of the contract has shot up to $113.7 million.B-2 AntennaNorthrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report) is the prime contractor for the US Air Force B-2 ‘Spirit’ stealth bomber, which is a low-observable, strategic, long-range, heavy bomber capable of penetrating sophisticated and dense air-defence shields.Raytheon’s SAS is the primary subcontractor on the B-2 Radar Modernization Program (RMP). Its Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) antenna is integrated in the B2 bomber to improve the radar’s performance and operational stealthiness.Our ViewThanks to its wide range of combat-proven defense products, Raytheon continues to receive scrumptious orders from both Pentagon as well as its foreign clients. This has allowed the company to generate solid sales growth of 8% in the fourth quarter.Meanwhile, its SAS business unit manufactures combat-proven radars and other sensors for aircraft, spacecraft and ships. The unit’s fourth-quarter sales accounted for 24.6% of the company’s total sales. No doubt, the recently won contract will add further impetus to this unit’s growth.Per a report by Markets and Markets research firm, the radar sensor market is expected to reach $20.64 billion by 2023 at a CAGR of 19.51% between 2017 and 2023. Inevitably, major radar manufacturers like Raytheon can hugely benefit from an anticipated steady growth projected over the years.Price MovementRaytheon’s stock has returned about 38.4% in the last 12 months compared with the broader industry’s gain of 34.1%. The outperformance was primarily led by the company’s strong international sales and a robust balance sheet. Zacks Rank & Key Picks    Raytheon carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks from the same sector are Boeing Co.

1070,NOC,"Northrop Grumman Corp.’s (NOC  -  Free Report) subsidiary unit, Northrop Grumman Systems Corp., recently secured a contract with a maximum ceiling value worth $475 million from the Missile Defense Agency, Huntsville, AL. Work related to this deal will involve development, integration, testing and fielding of complex advanced discrimination techniques and sustainment of complex modeling and simulation techniques and tools used to model Ballistic Missile Defense Systems (“BMDS”) capabilities.Details of the DealPer the deal, the company will develop advanced discrimination algorithms for the first time along with some highly complex software and tests. The entire contract has been divided into two task orders wherein approximately $9.9 million will be used for program management and another $143 million for the development of BMDS.The work will be carried out in Huntsville, AL; Colorado Springs, CO; Boulder, CO; and Azusa, CA. Ordering period for the deal is from Mar 2, 2018 through Mar 2, 2023.  Northrop Grumman will utilize fiscal 2018 research, development, test and evaluation funds to complete the task.Northrop’s Role in BMDSOf late, terrorist groups have been increasingly using cheap yet deadly man-portable missiles. Thus, an effective anti-missile solution for the protection against such threats is the need of the hour. A well- equipped nation like the United States will thus always want to remain prepared for sudden attacks.Realizing the rapidly expanding market for missile defense, major players like Northrop Grumman in the aerospace-defense space are increasing their focus on developing state-of-the-art missiles. In sync with this, Northrop Grumman’s Intercontinental Ballistic Missile-Minuteman-III holds immense importance, which was first deployed in 1970. Today, various modernization programs have extended this weapon’s operational life beyond 2030.Along with United States, other powerful nations across the globe are also expanding their missile strength. As a result of this, the global rocket and missile market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 4.74% during 2017-2022 to reach a value of $70 billion by 2022 (per Markets and Markets research firm).In fact to make most from the current situation, Northrop Grumman announced last September that it has settled the deal for acquisition of missile-maker Orbital ATK  for $9.2 billion. With this buyout, Northrop Grumman will benefit from the Orbital ATK's rocket motors, missiles and electro-optical countermeasure product lines.Further, in February 2018, the $716-billion proposal made by President Trump for the fiscal 2019 defense policy bill is anticipated to boost the defense industry. We believe this budget scenario in the United States as well as the growth prospect for the global missile market, along with frequent contract wins like the latest one, will enable Northrop Grumman to remain one of the major defense players in the market.Price PerformanceShares of Northrop Grumman have rallied about 42% in a year, compared with the broader industry’s gain of 48.7%. The underperformance may have been caused by intense competition that the company faces in both domestic and international markets. Zacks Rank & Key Picks    Northrop Grumman carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the same sector are Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) and Huntington Ingalls (HII  -  Free Report), each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

1072,NOC,"Trump’s announcement that the United States will impose a 25% tariff on steel imports and a 10% tariff on aluminum imports has become the latest cause of concern for the U.S. economy and Wall Street. The tariffs are likely to result in an increase in raw material cost for manufacturers that use these metals.Against this backdrop, with the help of an article published on npr.org, we highlight some sectors that could be impacted the most from the tariffs (read: Watch These ETFs as Trade War Risks Rise).AutoBoth steel and aluminum are vital to the production of cars and trucks sold in America and would push up the sale prices of those vehicles considerably. The American Automotive Policy Council believes that the change would put the U.S. auto industry at a ""competitive disadvantage.""However, the price hike won’t be the same for all. CNBC reported that General Motors (GM  -  Free Report) sees only a modest impact because it buys 90% of “steel for U.S. production from U.S. suppliers."" On the other hand, Honda Motor Co (HMC  -  Free Report) said that “imprudent tariffs imposed on imported steel and aluminum would raise prices on both domestic and imported products, thus causing an unnecessary financial burden on customers.”In this situation, First Trust NASDAQ Global Auto Index Fund CARZ should be monitored closely. However, since the fund invests only 19.67% in the United States, severe threat to the product is unexpected (read: ETFs in Focus Post Automobile Earnings).Alternative EnergySolar projects, wind turbines and energy storage units are also likely to be pricier. The tariff could result in a hike in the cost of offshore platforms and pipelines. In any case, the Trump administration's 30% tariff on imported solar cells and modules was put into effect this year (read: Trump's Import Tariffs: ETF & Stocks in Focus).Now with extra price increases on steel and aluminum, “which are used in ground-mount and rooftop solar racking systems,” the sector could be hit hard. Alternative ETFs including Guggenheim Solar ETF (TAN  -  Free Report) and First Trust ISE Global Wind Energy Index Fund (FAN  -  Free Report) should thus be followed with extra caution (read: Alternative Energy ETFs to Gain From First Solar Q4 Results).AerospaceU.S. aerospace industry thrives on steel and aluminum imports to construct aircraft. About 80% of an aircraft is made of aluminum. Companies like Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report), Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report) and Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report) may come under pressure. Aerospace and defense ETFs like iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF (ITA  -  Free Report) and SPDR S&P Aerospace & Defense ETF XAR may also feel the pinch.CandyAluminum foils are used to wrap chocolates. So, the tariff could lead to high costs for Hershey Company HSY and Mondelez International Inc. MDLZ.

1073,NOC,"Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) Aeronautics business division recently secured a delivery contract in relation to F-35 fighter jet. Work related to this deal is expected to be completed by February 2019.Details of the DealValued at $158.3 million, the deal was awarded by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, Maryland. Per the terms of the agreement, the company will offer program management, nonrecurring engineering, recurring engineering, site support and touch labor services to aid the modification and retrofit activities of the delivered air systems of the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter aircraft.The contract will cater to the Air Force, Marine Corps, Navy, non-Department of Defense (DoD) participant, and foreign military sales (“FMS”) customers.  The deal includes 48% of the work for the Air Force; 31% for the Marine Corps, 6% for the Navy, 11% for the non-DoD participants and 4% for international partners.Fiscal 2016 aircraft procurement, fiscal 2017 aircraft procurement, fiscal 2018 aircraft procurement, non-DoD participant and FMS funds will be utilized to complete the task at Fort Worth, TX.F-35 AttributesLockheed Martin’s F-35 Lightning II is a single-seat, single-engine 5th Generation fighter aircraft, which comes with an advanced stealth feature combined with enhanced fighter speed and agility, fully fused sensor information, network-enabled operations and advanced sustainment. Three variants of F-35 are set to replace five fighter jets for the U.S. Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps as well as a variety of fighter jets for at least 10 other countries.With Lockheed Martin being the primary partner, the F-35 program has been supported by an international team of leading aerospace majors. Notably, Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report) rendered its expertise in carrier aircraft and low-observable stealth technology to this program, BAE Systems’ (BAESY  -  Free Report) short takeoff and vertical landing experience, and air systems sustainment supported the jet’s combat capabilities. Moreover, Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies (UTX  -  Free Report), provides F-35s with the F135 propulsion system, which is the world's most powerful fighter engine.Recent DevelopmentsThe F-35 program is Lockheed Martin’s largest program, which generated 25% of its total net sales, as well as 64% of Aeronautics division’s net sales in 2017. Interestingly, this program has been repeatedly criticized by President Trump for being an overtly expensive project, in the recent past.To resolve this issue, the company inked an $8.5-billion deal with Pentagon in February 2017. Per the agreement, the company will deliver 90 F-35s of the 10th Lot at a historically low rate owing to Trump's intervention or to maintain management's earlier projection of cutting down cost by 6-7%. Over the next few years, the company is likely to adopt a cost-saving initiative to lower sustainment costs for F-35 by 10%. This, in turn, will result in cost savings of $1 billion over a five-year period. In fact, we believe the latest contract win will enable the company to take a step toward in achieving its goal and allow it to provide more of these combat aircraft at an efficiently reduced rate.Meanwhile, Lockheed Martin is enjoying steady flow of contracts from the Pentagon since reduction of its F-35 price. In July 2017, Lockheed Martin won a modification contract, worth $5.6 billion, to offer low-rate initial production of the 11th lot of F-35, while in August 2017 it won a contract worth $427million for procuring ancillary military equipment and pilot flight equipment for LRIP of the 11th Lot of F-35 jets.Production of F-35 is expected to continue for many years given the U.S. Government’s current inventory objective of 2,456  aircraft for the Air Force, Marine Corps and Navy; commitments from the company’s eight international partners and three international customers; as well as expressions of interest from other countries. Therefore, Lockheed Martin has solid growth prospect for F-35 program, which in turn will surely boost its profit margin.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

1074,NOC,"The year 2017 has been an overwhelming one for the U.S. economy, courtesy of President Trump’s policies that came up with many positive market movements. The fiscal 2018 (FY18) budget proposal, in particular, along with a rising interest rate environment backed by improving economic backdrop as well as progress on tax reforms have helped the S&P 500 index surge 20.1%, so far this year.Coming to the Aerospace sector, stocks in this space have been on a growth trajectory on anticipation of the new administration’s favoritism toward huge defense spending, since last year when Trump became the President. This year also the sector maintained similar trends.Impressively, stocks in the Zacks Aerospace sector (a stand-alone sector) have rallied 38.1% on a year-to-date basis, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 index’s 20.1% gain. Below we have discussed the major factors that have influenced the stocks in this sector, in recent times.Positives That Drove Aerospace Stocks: FY18 Budget and North Korea TiffThe FY18 defense budget reflected a 10% hike from the FY16 level. In fact, a favorable defense spending strategy endorsed by the U.S. administration has been a primary force driving these stocks. In September 2017 the U.S. Senate passed the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), better known as the FY18 defense policy bill, worth roughly $700 billion that extensively surpassed Trump’s budget request. It authorized an additional $8.5 billion for the Missile Defense Agency to strengthen homeland, regional and space missile defense, which is $630 million higher than the new administration's request.Meanwhile, there’s no denying that, while a slew of contract wins have been boosting defense stocks over the years, repeated counteractive missile-tests conducted by the United States and North Korea have been instrumental in the sector’s latest outperformance. In particular, following Trump’s strong condemning of North Korea’s hostile action, companies that either manufacture high-end missiles or offer missile surveillance services like Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC  -  Free Report) and Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report), gained substantially.Additionally, an anticipated military action in the Korean peninsula and a recent wave of mergers between big aerospace and defense companies have bolstered the sector’s performance. To fend off competition, Aerospace players are merging with their counterparts to restructure business models as well as expand their core operations and product lines. For example, United Technologies Corp. (UTX) decided to take over Rockwell Collins, Inc. for $30 billion this September. This mega deal is expected to create one of the world’s largest aircraft-equipment manufacturers.In the same month, Northrop Grumman agreed to buy rocket-maker Orbital ATK, Inc., for $9.2 billion. Post the deal, Northrop Grumman will benefit from Orbital’s rocket motors, missiles and electro-optical countermeasure product lines.Challenges Exist TooLike all sectors, the Aerospace space is faced with multiple headwinds. For instance, questions are still being raised on the FY18 budget and the viability of such high spending.Workforce-related issues like retaining aged workers along with employing graduates who lack technical acumen has been challenging the aerospace and defense industry. Per the Aviation Week & Space Technology 2017 Aerospace & Defense Workforce Study, approximately 60% of employees in this industry are over the age of 45 versus 44% in the overall U.S. workforce. Moreover, various regulations imposed on international trade of defense equipment remain the major deterrents to the sector’s growth.Moreover, internationally many emerging nations are posing stiff competition to the U.S. defense contractors. For instance, China is developing space technologies to block U.S. military communications, per a report commissioned by a panel formed by Congress. Similarly, per a CNBC report, Russian defense officials have confirmed deploying radar-imagery jammers and developing laser weapons to counter U.S. intelligence and ballistic missile defense satellites.Choosing the Winning StrategyConsidering all the aforementioned factors, we can say that Aerospace stocks exhibited a decent progress graph, so far this year, weathering all the headwinds. Notably, the stocks witnessed solid bottom-line profitability and top-line growth.In order to save investors from the time-taking process of identifying the key winners that crushed the market and are likely to gain further, we have created a screen using the Zacks Stock Screener.(Looking for the Best Stocks for 2018?

1077,NOC,"General Dynamics (GD  -  Free Report) announced that it has been awarded a $14.9 million contract by the U.S. Army Contracting Command, Yongsan, Korea.Details of the ContractThis is a modification contract per which the company will provide support and maintenance services for the combined mission command network operations.Work related to this deal will be carried out in the Republic of Korea and is expected to be over by Jul 31, 2018. The contract amount will be obligated at the time of the award from the fiscal 2017 operations and maintenance (Army) funds.Our ViewPresident Donald Trump’s proposed 10% hike on the 2018 defense budget has boosted the overall defense sector. Moreover, due to rise in global terrorism many non-U.S. countries have raised their defense budget lately.As a result, General Dynamics along with other defense giants such as Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report), The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) and Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC  -  Free Report) have been receiving regular contracts from different verticals of the U.S. Military.In particular, General Dynamics’ diverse product portfolio along with its spread-out customer base has provided it with opportunities to generate revenues from different sources. Moreover, the company has been consistently witnessing increased sales from non-U.S. based sources. These sources have helped General Dynamics to counter the volatility in domestic defense spending.Further, the company has a strong research and development segment that promotes the introduction of new products and first-to-market enhancements. General Dynamics’ wider customer choices, improved aircraft performance and new standards for customer safety, comfort and in-flight productivity are expected to boost its growth trajectory, over the long run.Price MovementShare price of General Dynamics has rallied 39.6% in the last one year, outperforming the Zacks categorized Aerospace-Defense industry’s gain of 26.5%.This could be because General Dynamics consistently maintains a strategic alliance with the U.S. Department of Defense, which allows it to enjoy a steady flow of contracts.Zacks RankGeneral Dynamics currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1078,NOC,"Falls Church, VA-based Northrop Grumman Corp.’s (NOC  -  Free Report) unit, Northrop Grumman Systems Corp., has won a contract to offer overall operations, and maintenance of command and control capabilities for the U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM).Details of the DealThe contract, which is valued at $98 million, has been awarded by the 55th Contracting Squadron, Offutt Air Force Base, NE.Per the deal, Northrop Grumman will provide software engineering, system engineering, testing, incorporation, installation, security engineering and administrative support. Additionally, the company will offer added support tasks necessary to give dependable, effective, and user-friendly, net-centric abilities in order to contribute to the overall operations and maintenance of USSTRATCOM C2 capabilities for the commander of USSTRATCOM.Furthermore, these tasks will support combatant commands, component commands, and other authorized users with modernized mission critical communications and computer systems employing general integrated information and decision toolsets, applications and capabilities in a fully-synchronized, net-centric information environment, essential for maintaining deterrence and, if required, dominate in conflict.The work is scheduled to be completed by Feb 28, 2023, and performed in Offutt Air Force Base, NE. The contract will use fiscal 2017 operations and maintenance funds.Qualities of USSTRATCOMHeadquartered at Offutt Air Force Base, NE, USSTRATCOM is one of nine unified commands in the U.S. Department of Defense. Also, it is liable for strategic deterrence, global strike, and operating the defense department's Global Information Grid. USSTRATCOM offers a number of abilities to support other combatant commands that covers strategic warning; integrated missile defense; and global command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (C4ISR). Notably, this vibrant command gives national leadership a unified resource for better understanding of specific threats around the world and the means to respond to those threats swiftly.Our ViewBeing the fourth-largest U.S. defense contractor, Northrop Grumman supplies a broad array of products and services to the U.S. Department of Defense, including defense electronics, unmanned aircraft and missile defense. In addition, the company continues to witness strong demand for its unmanned air systems on a global scale.Meanwhile, Donald Trump’s presidency seems to have created a win-win situation for the Aerospace and Defense majors like Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report), The Boeing Co. (BA  -  Free Report) and Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report). Evidently, the outlook for various stocks in this space has improved manifold in recent months on the back of enhanced spending promises that Trump had made in his latest “America First” budget.Specifically, the fiscal 2017 budget proposal reflected an annual increase of approximately $2.2 billion over the year-ago budget. Again, the Trump administration’s request for additional fiscal 2017 appropriations included an additional base budget of $24.9 billion and Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) budget worth $5.1 billion. A moderate flow of funds from the Pentagon also added to the optimism.Going forward, we expect the increased spending to be allocated to certain key areas that might unlock higher opportunities for Northrop Grumman.Price MovementNorthrop Grumman’s stock has been up 19.9% in the last one year, underperforming the Zacks categorized Aerospace–Defense industry’s gain of 27.6%. This could be because higher operating expenses continue to partially impact Northrop Grumman’s profit margin. Also, the company may be challenged by economic and political factors. Furthermore, in a highly competitive environment, customers might get attracted to similar products offered by its peers at a lower price, which is a major concern.Zacks RankNorthrop Grumman currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

1079,NOC,"Pentagon’s largest defense contractor, Lockheed Martin Corp.'s (LMT  -  Free Report) business unit, Missiles and Fire Control, has clinched a modification contract from the U.S. Army Contracting Command, Redstone Arsenal, AL. The deal involves foreign military sales (FMS) to Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the Republic of Korea, the United Arab Emirates and Taiwan.Details of the DealThe contract is valued at $130.3 million. Per the terms, Lockheed Martin will produce the PATRIOT Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) Missile for fiscal 2017 with an intention to expand the total missile segment enhancement quantity by 35. In addition, the company will provide 130 launcher modification kits with motor control units to the U.S.; parts library and missile segment enhancement storage and aging requirements to the U.S.; and cost and software data reporting requirement to the U.S. At the same time, it will reduce the missile round trainer quantity by 30 and the empty round trainer quantity by 36 for Qatar.Lockheed Martin will utilize fiscal 2015, 2016 and 2017 other and other procurement (Army) funds to complete the work by Jun 30, 2020. Work related to the modification deal will be carried out at Grand Prairie, Lufkin, El Paso, TX; Camden, AZ; Chelmsford, MA; Ocala, FL Huntsville, AL; Huntingdon Beach, CA.A Brief Note on PAC-3PAC-3 is the most advanced, capable and powerful terminal air-defense missile that can accost tactical ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and aircraft. It is a high-velocity interceptor that counters incoming targets by direct body-to-body impact. The PAC-3 missile uses a solid propellant rocket motor, aerodynamic controls, altitude control motors and inertial guidance to navigate.These missiles are currently used by six countries like the U.S., Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, the United Arab Emirates and Taiwan. Apart from the countries listed under the latest deal, the company also has a contract with Kuwait.According to Lockheed Martin, the PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement (PAC-3 MSE) interceptor employs a two-pulse solid rocket motor that increases altitude and range to meet increasing threats. The company expects strong demand for this advanced missile system going forward, particularly in the politically tense regions of the Middle East.What's Favoring Lockheed Martin?Lockheed Martin manufactures combat-proven PAC-3 missiles under production deals from the U.S. Army, Air and Missile Defense Program. This enables the company to enjoy a steady stream of contracts.Meanwhile, the Trump administration put forward the fiscal 2017 budget appropriation in March to expand the nation’s defense fund, citing that years of declining funding levels in the Army's investment and modernization accounts has hampered readiness of the U.S. forces. Notably, the appropriation request included enhanced funding for upgrading Missile defense system of the country.Also, everyone is aware of the continuous missile brawl between North Korea and the U.S that has been taking place for the last few months. All these development, in turn, are bound to boost the demand for today’s A-one missiles such as that of Lockheed Martin’s PAC-3. Consequently, allowing the company to benefit in the near term.Furthermore, Lockheed Martin plans to increase its international mix from 21% in 2016 to 30% of total sales in the upcoming years, owing to robust demand witness overseas for its programs. Latest contracts like the aforementioned ones are expected to uplift the company's international business, substantially. It may also attract more such contracts in the future, since PAC-3 is one of the top priorities in the Pentagon's missile system.Price PerformanceLockheed Martin’s stock has rallied 12.4% in the last one year, underperforming the Zacks categorized Aerospace/Defense  industry’s gain of 27.6%. This could be because the earlier budget cuts have put pressure on the top line, although the present defense budget is more in favor of the sector. Moreover, we believe that budget deficits and political uncertainty might make future defense budgets vulnerable to cutbacks. The company faces tough competition from other defense giants like The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report), General Dynamics Corp. (GD  -  Free Report) and Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC  -  Free Report) .Zacks RankLockheed Martin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1080,NOC,"Northrop Grumman’s (NOC  -  Free Report) Aerospace Systems business recently clinched a $429-million contract for two Extremely High Frequency Data Rate (EHF XDR) payloads. These high-frequency payloads will be used for the recapitalization of the Enhanced Polar System (EPS) and to support military satellite communications mission in the polar region.Details of the DealThe contract was awarded by the Space and Missile Systems Center, Military Satellite Communications Directorate, Los Angeles Air Force Base, California. Operations related to the deal will be carried out in Redondo Beach, CA.Northrop Grumman will utilize fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2018 research and development funds to complete the task. Work related to the deal is scheduled to be complete by December 2022.A Brief Note on EHF XDR PayloadsThe advanced EHF system provides joint, interoperable, assured connectivity for war fighters in all military operations levels. It is the nation’s next-generation military strategic and tactical relay system. Its satellite- based EHF communications payloads provide advanced communications terminals, a gateway to connect with the Global Information Grid and other communication systems.The EHF payload delivers XDR (Extreme Data Rate) communications services, providing data rates up to 8.192 Mbps per user. This helps Air Force system operators to rapidly establish and reconfigurenetworks to meet dynamic command and control requirements.Our ViewIn the past couple of years, frequent cyber-attacks, following the one in May 2017 with more than 45,000 attacks, has been affecting various nations. We believe that Northrop Grumman has significant upside potential based on the U.S. government’s increased focus on Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaissance (ISR), unmanned systems as well as cyber security. Naturally, more inflow of contracts for equipment related to cyber security have been coming from the Pentagon.However, lower volumes at the EHF program have been hampering growth of Northrop Grumman’s Space sub-segment, which develops EHF systems and payload. With these payloads providing survivable, protected communications to U.S. forces, we may expect more contract wins, which in turn will substantially boost the Space sub-segment’s performance.Price PerformanceShares of Northrop Grumman have rallied about 38% in a year, compared with the broader industry’s gain of 40.1%. The underperformance may have been caused by intense competition in domestic and international markets.  Zacks Rank & Key Picks    Northrop Grumman carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A few better-ranked stocks in the same sector are Boeing (BA  -  Free Report), Huntington Ingalls (HII  -  Free Report) and Spirit Aerosystems (SPR  -  Free Report), each of them sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

1081,NOC,"The fourth-quarter earnings season is well under way with 53 S&P 500 members having reported their quarterly numbers as of Jan 19. So far, the earnings trend appears impressive with tax cuts driving the results.Quarterly earnings of the 53 S&P members have improved 11.7% while revenues increased 7.5%. The beat ratio for the bottom line was 81.1% while that for top line was 75.5%, as of Jan 19.Coming to the Zacks Aerospace-Defense industry , none of the stocks have reported results so far. However, considering the inherent stability of this industry, projections for the  Aerospace sector (one of the 16 Zacks sector), which constitutes the Aerospace-Defense industry, hint at an impressive quarter, when compared to its third-quarter performance.Evidently, the sector's earnings are likely to improve 6.6% on 5.7% higher revenues in the fourth quarter.  Third-quarter earnings for this sector declined 6.8%. For more details on quarterly releases, you can go through our latest  Earnings Preview .Defense stocks remained on a growth trajectory in the fourth quarter, courtesy of the various defense policy initiatives adopted by President Trump. A steady flow of contracts from Pentagon also provided an impetus to the stocks. With Trump strongly opposing the budget sequestration imposed by his predecessor, defense stocks are likely to gain traction in the coming days. Moreover, growing international market for weaponries with more developing nations expanding their defense spending is also likely to fuel the industry's growth.With almost 262 companies (81 S&P 500 members) slated to report fourth-quarter results this week, let's find out where the following defense stocks stand before their earnings release on Jan 25.Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report) delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3.68% in the last quarter. The company outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the four trailing quarters, with an average beat of 6.50%.We expect the Missile Systems business unit of the defense major to primarily drive the company’s revenues in the quarter. Missile systems contribute nearly 30% of the company’s total sales and continue to be a major growth driver. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter Missile systems sales is pegged at $2,219 million, reflecting year-over-year growth of 17.1%.Apart from its strong hold in missile defense, the company also enjoys a leading position in offering cybersecurity, particularly on the domestic front. Moreover, its overseas business sales is also expected to boost results.Per our proven model, a stock is likely to beat earnings estimates if it has a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Raytheon Company does have the right combination.The company has an Earnings ESP of +0.08%.

(Read more: Will Missile Deals Drive Raytheon's Earnings in Q4?)Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report) delivered a positive earnings surprise of 26.03% in the last quarter. The company outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the four trailing quarters, with an average beat of 17.24%.The Aerospace Systems segment comprises almost half of Northrop Grumman’s sales and has traditionally been a primary contributor to growth. However, the segment managed to clinch very few contracts in the fourth quarter like the $445-million Air Force contract to support LAIRCM program. This is reflected in the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s fourth-quarter revenues, which stands at $2,861 million, reflecting an annual decline of 0.4%.The lack of substantial deals could adversely impact the top-line of the company. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is pegged at $6.37 billion, reflecting a 0.4% year-over-year decline. Northrop Grumman Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Northrop Grumman Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Northrop Grumman Corporation QuoteNorthrop Grumman does not have the right combination for an earnings beat this season. The company’s Earnings ESP of -0.69%, when combined with its Zacks Rank #2 makes a beat unlikely this season.

The company outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the four trailing quarters, with an average beat of 9.13%.The company’s fourth-quarter sales expectation of $2.8-$2.9 billion also reflects 6% decline in organic growth. Probably this prediction led to a 2.9% annual decline in the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $2.31 per share.L-3 Communications Holdings, Inc.

1082,NOC,"On Jan 19, Defense Secretary Jamis Mattis finally unveiled the highly awaited National Defense Strategy for 2018. Speaking at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies, Mattiss warned that the United States’ competitive edge has “eroded in every domain of warfare” and is “continually eroding” even now.Mattiss went on to outline a new strategy which focuses on cementing alliances, improving coordination with the State Department and elicit steady financial backing from Congress. One of the major priorities of the new strategy was to increase investments in various areas ranging from nuclear and cyber warfare to space operations and capabilities.This new strategy is another reminder that improving the capabilities of the defense services is at the top of the Trump administration’s agenda. The document has also been released at a time when major defense stocks are preparing to report earnings numbers.With General Dynamics Corporation (GD  -  Free Report) and Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT  -  Free Report) scheduled to report on Jan 24 and Jan 29, respectively, this may be a good time to consider which of these is a better stock. Both these stocks have a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Other defense stocks reporting earnings this month include Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report) and The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report)Price PerformanceIn terms of price performance, Lockheed Martin is a clear winner. Both stocks have underperformed the broader industry, which has gained 13.4% over the last three months. However, Lockheed Martin has gained 6% over this period, clearly outperforming General Dynamics which has lost -1.4%. ValuationSince the defense sector is capital intensive, the most appropriate ratio to value companies is EV/EBITDA. Additionally, it is the ideal metric to compare two companies within the same industry. Further, it is not impacted by differing capital structures and excludes the impact of non-cash expenses.  Coming to the two defense stocks, with an EV/EBITDA value of 15.64, Lockheed Martin is overvalued relative to the rest of the industry. General Dynamics holds the edge here with a lower EV/EBITDA value of 13.55, making it undervalued relative to the rest of the industry, which has an EV/EBITDA value of 13.68.Return on CapitalReturn on capital or return on capital employed is a suitable metric to compare the profitability of companies relying on the quantum of capital that they utilize. The capital utilized or employed is the total capital that the company requires to return a profit. This ratio is particularly useful when the objective is to compare the performance of companies which belong to capital intensive sectors. This is because unlike other profitability metrics like return on equity (ROE), return on capital takes into account debt and other related liabilities.Such an approach ensures a more holistic picture of companies which utilize a significant amount of debt. Here, Lockheed Martin is clearly ahead with a return on equity level of 23.3%, which is higher than the General Dynamic’s level of 21.6%.Debt to AssetsThe debt to assets ratio or debt ratio is utilized to gauge the amount of leverage a company utilizes. A higher ratio necessarily indicates a higher amount of leverage, which raises the financial risk involved. Industries which are capital intensive in nature usually have a relatively higher debt ratio. Lockheed Martin is saddled with a relatively poor debt-to-assets level of 29.2%. This round easily goes to General Dynamics, which has a debt-to-assets ratio of around 14%, which is lower than Lockheed Martin’s as well as that of the broader industry, which has a debt-to-assets ratio of 17.1%.Dividend YieldLockheed Martin’s dividend yield over the last one year period is 2.41%. With a dividend yield of 1.6%, General Dynamics’ shareholders earn a lower dividend yield than those of Lockheed Martin as well as the broader industry, which has an average dividend yield of 1.7%. Earnings History, ESP and Estimate RevisionsConsidering a more comprehensive earnings history, Lockheed Martin has delivered earnings surprises in three of the four preceding quarters. On the other hand, General Dynamics has delivered earnings surprises in all of the four preceding quarters. While General Dynamics has an average earnings surprise of 3.4%, Lockheed Martin stands out with an average earnings surprise of 4.9%.When considering Earnings ESP values, Lockheed Martin holds the edge with a reading of +0.31%, higher than General Dynamics’ figure of +0.19%. At the same time, Lockheed Martin’s earnings estimate for the current year has increased by 3.8% over the last 30 days, higher than General Dynamics’ level of 3.7%. ConclusionOur comparative analysis shows that there is little to choose between the stocks when considering ranks, since both carry a Zacks Rank #2. But General Dynamics does hold an edge over Lockheed Martin when considering valuation and debt ratios.However, Lockheed Martin is superior when considering price performance, dividend yield, estimate revisions and a more detailed earnings history. What clinches the case for Lockheed Martin over General Dynamics is a higher ESP value, which makes it a better choice ahead of upcoming earnings results.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.Click for details >>

1083,NOC,"Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release fourth-quarter and 2017 results on Jan 25, before the opening bell.Lack of orders from Pentagon as well as international allies of the United States may hamper the company’s fourth quarter sales growth. Moreover, the Aerospace Systems segment is not likely to be a majorsupport for Northrop Grumman this time around.Let’s discuss the factors influencing the defense giant’s quarterly release.Will Aerospace Systems Remain the Key Contributor?The Aerospace Systems segment fetches almost half of Northrop Grumman’s sales and has traditionally been a primary contributor to growth.Usually, increased demand as well as deliveries of manned aircraft boosts sales at this segment. However, the segment managed to clinch very few contracts in the fourth quarter.This is reflected in the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s Q4 revenues, which stands at $2,861 million, reflecting an annual decline of 0.4%.Lack of Orders to Impact SalesDefense majors have been receiving a slew of contracts from the Pentagon and foreign U.S. allies, Northrop Grumman being no exception. However, in the fourth quarter, the company won a handful of notabledeals only like the $445-million Air Force contract to support LAIRCM program.Consequently, the Q4 revenue growth expectation is not very ambitious. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is pegged at $6.37 billion, reflecting a 0.4% year-over-year decline.Other Factors to ConsiderThe Mission Systems business has been benefiting from increased volume for sensors and processing programs along with air and missile defense programs and Advanced Capabilities business. Considering acontinuation of this trend in the final quarter of the year as well, Northrop Grumman had slightly lifted the 2017 sales expectation for this unit during the third-quarter earnings call.Taking this into consideration, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the unit’s Q4 revenues is pegged at $2,906 million, reflecting annual growth of 2.1%.Meanwhile, unallocated corporate expenses rose $90 million in the third quarter, primarily on account of the Orbital ATK acquisition. As the transaction is still on track, we expect the company to incur higherunallocated corporate expenses in the fourth quarter as well.Northrop Grumman Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Northrop Grumman Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Northrop Grumman Corporation Quote Earnings WhisperOur proven model does not conclusively shows an earnings beat for Northrop Grumman this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy)or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here, as we will see below:Zacks ESP: Northrop Grumman has an Earnings ESP of -0.69%.

1084,NOC,"The Aerospace-Defense industry was rallying higher last week buoyed by the record order numbers released by Airbus Group (EADSY  -  Free Report) for 2017, which surpassed The Boeing Company’s (BA  -  Free Report) figures.  Also, a generous flow of funds from the Pentagon kept this industry on its toes over the trailing five trading sessions.Consequently, major indices in the Aerospace-Defense industry ended in the green. Evidently, the S&P 500 Aerospace & Defense (Industry) index improved 3.7% over the said time frame, while the Dow Jones U.S. Aerospace & Defense index saw an uptick of 3.6%.Among the other highlights of the last week, defense majors Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report), Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report) and Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC  -  Free Report) secured a number of orders from the Department of Defense’s daily funding session. Meanwhile Rockwell Collins’ shareholders approved its pending acquisition by United Technologies, Corp. (UTX  -  Free Report), whereas Embraer S.A.

1085,NOC,"The Boeing Co. (BA  -  Free Report) received a $12.64-million delivery order for the production and delivery of 39 retrofit kits for the T-45 aircraft Service Life Extension program. Per the terms of the deal, the company will supplysupport equipment and tools for the program.Details of the DealBoeing will carry out retrofit engineering and logistics to support the installation of associated government technical directives. The contract was awarded by the Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division,Orlando, FL.Work related to the deal will be majorly carried out in St. Louis, MO, and is scheduled to be over by September 2019. Boeing will also utilize fiscal 2017 aircraft procurement (Navy) fund to complete the task.    A Brief Note on T-45 AircraftBoeing’s T-45 Goshawk aircraft is the naval version of the land-based British Aerospace Hawk. The aircraft is powered by a British/French Rolls-Royce Turbomeca F405-RR-401 turbofan engine delivering up to5,527 lbs of thrust with a maximum speed listed at 645 miles per hour. Service ceiling is approximately 42,500 feet with a rate-of-climb nearing 8,000 feet per minute.Our ViewBoeing, being one of the largest aerospace and defense contractors, is a market leader in terms of revenues, orders and deliveries. The company enjoys a solid inflow of contracts from both the Pentagon as wellas foreign allies, courtesy of its varied defense equipment.In the defense industry, following the $700-billion fiscal 2018 defense bill, Boeing has been witnessing a solid inflow of contracts. One such contract is the $279-million deal for delivering the first KC-46 tanker andlogistics support to the Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF).We believe that the aforementioned contract along with several other deals reflects increased attention of the U.S. government on strengthening its defense front and opting for defense giants like Boeing asappropriate contractors.During the third-quarter earnings call, Boeing raised its 2017 sales outlook citing higher sales volume as the primary reason. Given the slew of contracts that the company has been winning, including the recentone, we may expect Boeing to continue delivering impressive sales growth in the days ahead.Price MovementBoeing’s stock has rallied about 121.7% in a year, compared with the broader industry’s gain of 56.9%. The outperformance was primarily led by significant demand for its military jets along with robust worldwidedemand for its commercial aircraft.  Zacks Rank & Key PicksBoeing carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks from the same space are Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings, Inc.

1086,NOC,"Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) Aeronautics segment recently secured a modification contract for F-35 jet to support the Israel defense force. Work related to this deal is expected to be over by December 2021.Details of the DealValued at $148 million, the contract was awarded by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD. Per the terms of the deal, Lockheed Martin will procure Israel-unique weapons certification, modification kits, and electronic warfare analysis in support of the F-35 Lightning II Israel system design and development. This will offer 3F+ fleet to the government of Israel under the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program.Majority of the work will be carried out in Orlando, FL; El Segundo, CA; Fort Worth, TX and Nashua, NH.  FMS funds will be utilized to finance the task.A Brief Note on F-35Lockheed Martin’s F-35 Lightning II is a 5th Generation, single-seat, single-engine fighter jet. It offers a combination of advanced stealth as well as fighter speed and agility, fully fused sensor information, network-enabled operations and advanced sustainment.With Lockheed Martin being the primary partner, the F-35 program has been supported by an international team of leading aerospace majors like Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC  -  Free Report), BAE Systems plc (BAESY  -  Free Report) and Pratt & Whitney — an unit of United Technologies (UTX  -  Free Report).Our ViewThanks to its diverse state-of-the art defense equipment, Lockheed Martin remains the largest U.S. defense contractor. Notably, the F-35 program continues to be a primary growth driver for the company.  Evidently, Lockheed Martin witnessed 12% top-line growth in the fourth quarter for its Aeronautics segment, primarily driven by the F-35 program. The company delivered 66 F-35 aircraft that represents an annual growth of 44% in 2017. Management expects this momentum to continue and the company to deliver approximately 90 jets in 2018, reflecting year-over-year growth of 35%. Over the next few years, Lockheed Martin expects to achieve full-rate production for F-35.In terms of delivery, till date the company has dispatched more than 265 F-35 jets to the United States and international customers. Production of the F-35 aircraft is expected to continue for many years given the U.S. government's current inventory target of 2,443 aircraft for the Air Force, Marine Corps and Navy.Apart from its strong demand scenario in the domestic market, the F-35 program enjoys a solid forte in the international front as well.  Evidently, Norway received its first three conventional, take-off and landing F-35As, during the fourth quarter of 2017. Moreover in 2017, seven of Lockheed Martin’s 11 international customers accepted the F-35 deliveries. This shows the notable demand F-35 enjoys in the international market as well.According to a report by Reuters, Germany’s 85 Tornado jets will go out of service by 2030. In relation to this the country has identified F-35 along with Boeing’s F-15 and F/A-18E/F jets as their next best alternatives.

1087,NOC,"The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) recently secured a modification contract worth $6.6 billion for extending the Ground-based Midcourse Defense (“GMD”) development and sustainment contract (“DSC”).  Performance related to the DSC contract modification will be executed through December 2023.Details of the DealThe deal was awarded by the Missile Defense Agency, Huntsville, AL. Boeing is the prime contractor and other subcontractors of this deal include Orbital ATK , Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC  -  Free Report) and Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report) who will work together in extending the DSC. Notably, the modification has taken the total cumulative face value of the contract to $12.6 billion.Per the terms of the DSC, these contractors will aid in development, fielding, test, systems engineering, integration and configuration management, equipment manufacturing and refurbishment, training, and operations and sustainment for the GMD weapon system and associated support facilities.Notably, the aforementioned modification provisions for the Missile Defense Agency to execute missile defense and defense enhancements to complete the accelerated delivery of a new missile field and procurement and deployment of 20 additional Ground Based Interceptors.  This new field will be equipped with 20 additional silos and two additional silos in a previously constructed missile field at Fort Greely, Alaska.Work under this modification includes technical capabilities for expanding and improving the nation’s missile defense system to ensure upgraded defensive capabilities by boosting vehicle (BV) development; integration of redesigned kill vehicle (RKV) with BV; providing GBI assets for labs and test events; development, integration, testing and deployment of ground systems software builds to address emerging threats; acquisition and emplacement of launch support equipment; expanded systems testing through all ground and flight testing; cyber security support; and, performance based logistics.Work will be carried out at multiple locations across the United States at government designated sites as well as other contractor designated prime, subcontractor, and supplier operating locations. Fiscal 2017 and 2018 research, development, test and evaluation funds were utilized to partially finance the deal obligated at the time of award.Our ViewThe series of missile-related feuds between the United States and North Korea, which has been hitting the headlines of the defense space all along the second half of 2017, has prompted the U.S. administration to further strengthen its missile power. We believe the latest contract won by Boeing is a bright example of that.Apart from being the largest aircraft manufacturer in the world, Boeing is also one of the major players in the defense space. Notably, the company’s Defense, Space & Security business segment manufactures develops a varied number of defense related products like manned and unmanned military aircraft and weapons systems including missile systems. The segment is involved in prime defense related programs like GMD; satellite systems: commercial, civil and military satellites; and space exploration: Space Launch System, Commercial Crew and International Space Station. In its recently reported quarterly result, the company’s defense business reflected a solid 5% revenue growth in the fourth quarter driven by higher weapon deliveries. Management projects 2018 defense revenues for Boeing in the $21.5-$22.5 billion range, to which we believe this latest contract, will contribute substantially.With the Markets and Markets research firm projecting rocket and missile market to grow at a CAGR of 4.74%  during 2017-2022 to a value worth $70 billion by 2022, scrumptious order flows like the recent one surely indicates at Boeing’ enhanced growth prospects in this market.Price MovementBoeing’s stock has rallied about 116.2% in a year, compared with the broader industry’s gain of 57.1%. The outperformance was primarily led by significant demand for its military jets along with robust worldwide demand for its commercial aircraft.  Zacks Rank Boeing sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

1090,NOC,"Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report) has won a modification contract for the C-130J center wing box replacement program. This contract has been awarded by the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Robins Air Force Base, GA.Contract DetailsPer the $21.3 million modification, Lockheed Martin will support the purchase of an additional quantity of five each C-130J center wing boxes, five each component kits and a project management review.With this modification, the total cumulative face value of the contract reaches $72.7 million.Work related to the deal will be carried out in Marietta and Atlanta, GA. The contract will use fiscal 2018 aircraft procurement funds to complete the deal by Sep 4, 2021.A Brief Note on C-130JC-130J Super Hercules is the latest model in Lockheed Martin’s Hercules family. It is a four-engine turboprop military transport aircraft. The C-130J's crew includes only two pilots and one loadmaster because no navigator or flight engineer is required on the aircraft. Among its missions, the C-130J counts capabilities as diverse as special ops, aerial refueling, close air support, search and rescue, and personal recovery.The J-model is almost similar to the classic Hercules in terms of general appearance. However, it uses updated technology like the new Rolls-Royce AE 2100 D3 turboprops from Rolls-Royce Holdings plc that comes with the Dowty R391 composite scimitar propellers, digital avionics and reduced crew requirements. These improvements have boosted its performance over C-130E/H predecessors. In particular, this latest model comes with 40% greater range, 21% higher speed and 41% reduced take-off distance.Our ViewLockheed Martin is the largest U.S. defense contractor with a platform-centric focus that guarantees a steady inflow of follow-on orders from a leveraged presence in the Army, Air Force, Navy and IT programs. Its Aeronautics business division is engaged in the production and upgradation of advanced military aircraft including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles and related technologies. Notably, C-130J is one of the major Aeronautics programs of the company as well as of the U.S. Air Force.In 2016, Lockheed Martin delivered 24 C-130J aircraft, five of which were offered to international customers. As of Dec 31, 2016, the company had 88 of these aircraft in its backlog, which is anticipated to increase in the coming days courtesy of the latest won deal.Moreover, given the recently growing demands from overseas market for this tactical aircraft, (particularly from France and Israel) we can expect the company to secure similar contracts related to C-130J jets in the days ahead.Interestingly, in its latest quarterly results, the company’s Aeronautics division witnessed revenue growth of 14%, with sales volume from C-130J program being one of the driving factors. Going ahead, given the strong demand for C-130J, more similar deals can be expected in coming days, which in turn will make the C-130J program as one of the primary growth drivers for the company.Furthermore, the fiscal 2018 defense policy has authorized the United States to spend $700 billion on defense. This has enhanced the prospect of increased order flow from Pentagon for major defense contractors like Lockheed Martin, Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report), The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) and others.Price MovementLockheed Martin’s stock was up about 20% in a year compared with the broader industry’s gain of 36.7%. This underperformance could have been caused by the intense competition that the company faces for its broad portfolio of products and services domestically as well as internationally.Zacks RankLockheed Martin carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1091,NOC,"Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) Aeronautics business division secured a modification contract worth $37.7 million in relation to F-35 fighter jet. Work related to this deal will be carried out in Fort Worth, TX and Samlesbury, UK.Per the terms, the company will exercise an option to conduct software conversions for structure and systems datasets. These conversions will be done to support the production of the 10th lot of Lockheed Martin’s F-35 joint strike fighter.The contract was awarded by the Naval Air Systems Command Patuxent River, MD. Fiscal 2016 aircraft procurement (Navy and Marine Corps); fiscal 2017 (Air Force and Navy); and non-Department of Defense (DoD) participants funds will be utilized to complete the task by June 2020.A Brief Note on F-35Lockheed Martin’s F-35 Lightning II is a 5th Generation, single-seat, single-engine fighter jet. It offers a combination of advanced stealth as well as fighter speed and agility, fully fused sensor information, network-enabled operations and advanced sustainment.With Lockheed Martin being the primary partner, the F-35 program has been supported by an international team of leading aerospace majors like Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC  -  Free Report), BAE Systems plc (BAESY  -  Free Report) and Pratt & Whitney — an unit of United Technologies (UTX  -  Free Report).Our ViewWe remind investors that despite offering superior air security and stability, the F-35 program has been facing some engine-related technical issues for the last few years. Additionally, it has been repeatedly criticized by President Trump for being an overtly expensive project.In this regard, Lockheed Martin inked an $8.5-billion deal with Pentagon in February 2017. Per the agreement, the company will deliver 90 F-35s of the 10th Lot at a historically low rate owing to Trump's intervention or to maintain management's earlier projection of cutting down cost by 6-7%.The company is likely to adopt a cost-saving initiative to lower sustainment costs for F-35 by 10%, over the next few years. This, in turn, will result in cost savings of $1 billion over a five-year period. In fact, we believe the recent contract win will enable the company to take a step toward achieving its goal and allow it to provide more of these combat aircraft at an efficiently reduced rate.Meanwhile, Lockheed Martin is enjoying steady flow of contracts from the Pentagon since reduction of its F-35 price. In July 2017, Lockheed Martin won a modification contract, worth $5.6 billion, to offer low-rate initial production of the 11th lot of F-35, while in August 2017 it won a contract worth $258 million, to offer LRIP of the 10th lot of F-35.Furthermore, with the U.S. government expecting to spend approximately $400 billion in the upcoming decades for the development and purchase of 2,443 F-35 jets, Lockheed Martin is trying its best to effectively reduce the price of this program. Also, the government is likely to place larger orders, thus boosting the company’s profits in the near term.Price MovementShares of Lockheed Martin have moved up 19.1% over a year, underperforming the 30.3% rally of the industry it belongs to. This could be because the earlier budget cuts have put pressure on the top line while the present defense budget is more in favor of the sector.  Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

The system operates on four E-11As modified Bombardier BD-700 Global aircraft and three high-altitude drones.The BACN is an airborne communications relay and gateway system that bridges the gap between theater operations, mountainous terrain inhibitedline-of-sight communications; diverse weapon systems, enabling essential situational awareness from small ground units in contact up to the highest command levels.Our ViewWe believe that Northrop Grumman has significant upside potential based on the U.S. government’s increased focus on Intelligence SurveillanceReconnaissance (ISR), airborne communication systems, force protection and cyber security.Apart from providing a broad array of products and services to the U.S. Department of Defense, including defense electronics, unmanned aircraftand missile defense, Northrop Grumman’s Mission Systems business segment includes the BACN program.During the third quarter of 2017, the company’s Mission Systems segment sales increased 5.2% to $2.84 billion. For 2017, the company marginallyraised its sales outlook for this segment on anticipation of solid order growth. Going ahead, we expect the latest contract win to positivelyimpact this segment’s top line in 2018 as well.In September 2017, the approval of the fiscal 2018 defense policy bill, worth $700 billion, by the U.S. Senate provided a boost to the defense industry. We believe the raised budget will draw more contracts for defense majors like Northrop Grumman and also help the company acquire contracts related to airborne communications. The latest contract win from the Pentagon is reflective of the same.Price MovementNorthrop Grumman’s stock has moved up about 36.9% in a year, compared with the broader industry’s gain of 53.8%. The underperformance may have been caused by intense competition for its broad portfolio of products and services in the domestic and international markets.Zacks Rank & Other Key PicksNorthrop Grumman carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).A few other top-ranked stocks from the same sector are Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings, Inc. (AJRD  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), and Curtiss-Wright Corporation (CW  -  Free Report) and Spirit Aerosystems Holdings, Inc.

1095,NOC,"Aircraft giant, The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report), has recently agreed to sell 16 of its airplanes to Malaysia Airlines. The deal was sealed by signing a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) by both parties. The MOU comprises of two orders for delivery of eight 787-9 Dreamliners and 737 MAXs each.Details of the DealThe order for eight 787-9s was converted from a previous order of 737 MAX. Malaysia Airlines also added eight purchase rights over 737 MAX aircraft. Further, the national carrier opted for Boeing's Global Fleet Care service to maintain its current and future Boeing airplanes. If finalized, this agreement will get reflected on the Boeing’s orders and deliveries website.Notably, the 16 planes are worth $3.06 billion at list prices, according to Bloomberg. But it goes without saying that the airlines will enjoy a substantial discount on this amount.According to the Malaysian Prime Minister, Najib Razak, the airline may place an order for another 25 737s in the near future. It is anticipated that on finalization, this deal will be worth more than $10 billion within five years. However, Boeing has not reciprocated to this statement of Razak.787-9 FleetBoeing’s 787-9 Dreamliner jet represents one of the latest models of the company’s family of superefficient 787 jets, offering more seats and cargo capability than its previous versions. With the fuselage stretched by 6 meters (20 feet) over the 787-8 model, the 787-9 comes with 20% less fuel use and 20% fewer emissions than other aircraft of similar size.Leveraging the visionary design of the 787-8, the 787-9 jet promises to offer passenger-pleasing features such as large windows, large stow bins, modern LED lighting, higher humidity, a lower cabin altitude, cleaner air and a smoother ride.737 MAX’s AttributesBoeing’s 737 MAX family of commercial aircraft incorporates the latest-technology CFM International LEAP-1B engines to deliver the highest efficiency, reliability and passenger comfort in the single-aisle market. In particular, these jets boast a 40% smaller noise footprint than today's single-aisle airplanes.Nevertheless, Boeing’s 737 model remains one of the best-selling planes in the single-aisle market, thanks to its fuel efficiency and passenger comfort. Therefore, to maintain its dominance in the commercial aerospace market, this aerospace behemoth continues to invest in research and development for upgrading and churning out upgraded versions of its existing planes.Our ViewWe would like to remind investors that, despite facing several headwinds from the very beginning of its inception, the 787 family of jets has remained one of the crucial centerpieces of Boeing’s commercial aircraft business line.Evidently, per the company’s second quarter 2017 results, Boeing has made notable progress on the 787 program. The company also announced recently that it will increase its production rate for this program to 14 per month in 2019.Markedly, Malaysia Airlines, the Southeast Asian nation’s flag carrier, has been a long-standing customer of Boeing. In 2016, the airlines signed a deal to purchase up to 50 737 MAX aircraft, which included 25 firm orders and 25 purchase rights. The deliveries of these planes are expected in 2019 and 2021.We believe that Boeing’s 787 fleet will empower the airlines to operate in any place in Europe and some destinations in the United States. In fact, deal for 787-9s is expected to open up more number of global routes for the carrier, thereby encouraging it to buy more of Boeing’s aircraft and bringing in more revenue for the aircraft major.Encouraging Q2 Order DetailsA quick sneak peek into the company’s recent order details will further boost investors’ optimism in this stock’s growth. Evidently, in the first half of 2017, Boeing booked 381 net commercial orders. On the contrary, the company’s arch rival, Airbus Group SE (EADSY  -  Free Report), registered net bookings of just 203 aircraft in the same period, thus trailing far behind.Being the two largest players in the commercial aircraft space, Boeing and Airbus faces intensifying competition in the Aerospace–Defense industry. Nevertheless, Boeing’s huge order growth have recently placed it in a better position in the industry and orders like the latest one will surely help it to retain that leading position.Price MovementShares of Boeing have surged 89.5% in the last 12 months, outperforming the industry’s gain of 41.7%. This could be because the company’s strong balance sheet and cash flows that provide financial flexibility in matters of incremental dividend, ongoing share repurchases and earnings accretive acquisitions.Zacks Rank & Key PicksBoeing currently holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Some other top-ranked stocks in the same space include Leidos Holdings, Inc. (LDOS  -  Free Report) and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report). While Leidos Holdings sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Northrop Grumman carries the same bullish rank as Boeing. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Leidos Holdings delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 18.01% in the last four quarters. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings moved up 1.1% in the last 30 days.Northrop Grumman pulled off an average positive earnings surprise of 12.60% in the last four quarters. Its 2017 earnings estimates inched up 0.2% in the last 30 days.5 Trades Could Profit ""Big-League"" from Trump PoliciesIf the stocks above spark your interest, wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington's changing course.Today Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals, tariffs, lower taxes, higher interest rates, and spending surges in defense and infrastructure.See these buy recommendations now >>

1096,NOC,"Defense major Northrop Grumman Corporation’s (NOC  -  Free Report) business unit, Northrop Grumman Systems Corp., recently secured a modification contract worth $11 million, in relation to the Navy’s WSN-7 navigation system. Work related to the deal is scheduled to be over by April 2019.The contract was awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C. Per the terms of the modification, the company will exercise a one-year option for production and supply of associated provisioned items of WSN-7 navigation system. Work will be carried out in Charlottesville, VA. Northrop Grumman will utilize fiscal 2017 shipbuilding and conversion (Navy) funds and fiscal 2017 other procurement (Navy) funds to finance the task.A Brief Note on WSN-7 Navigation SystemThe Inertial Navigation System (INS) AN/WSN-7 is a passive shipboard navigation system, deployed in the U.S. Navy ships, to calculate and indicate ship's position, attitude, heading and velocity in relation to the earth's rotation. The INS senses motion (inertial), gravity and earth rotation and helps in navigation functions.Additionally, the INS receives GPS updates and the ship's speed. The system is capable of operating throughout the world without any external position reference information. Per the U.S. Navy, the INS is unsusceptible to jamming and cannot be also detected by the opposition.Our ViewBeing the fourth-largest U.S. defense contractor, Northrop Grumman supplies a broad array of products and services to the U.S. Department of Defense, including defense electronics, unmanned aircraft and missile defense. Its Mission Systems business segment provides services relation to navigation systems.During the second quarter of 2017, this segment witnessed 3% revenue growth, courtesy of higher sales volume. Going ahead, for 2017, the company raised its sales outlook for the segment on the anticipation of success in the coat-reduction initiatives that management undertook as well as solid sales volume, in particular for F-35 jets.Notably, the company has a strong presence in Air Force, Space & Cyber Security programs which have aided it in securing regular contracts from different verticals of U.S. Defense. We believe winning contracts like the recent one will help Northrop Grumman in achieving its enhanced sales target for Mission Systems.Price PerformanceShares of Northrop Grumman have returned 26.2% in the last year compared to the industry’s increase of 36.1%. This might have been led by the company’s escalating operating expenses.In addition, steep competition from peers like Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report), The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) and General Dynamics Corporation (GD  -  Free Report) remains a major concern.Zacks RankNorthrop Grumman currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1097,NOC,"The U.S. aerospace and defense industry grabbed investors’ attention this week on the back of two significant developments. On Sep 5, defense stocks surged following North Korea’s ‘successful’ hydrogen bomb test — largest nuclear device test since 2006.The U.S. administration strongly condemned the act, wherein the U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis warned North Korea of dire consequences if the nation goes on encouraging such violent operations. This in turn boosted defense stocks on anticipation of escalated military actions from the United States.The finalization of the merger between United Technologies and Rockwell Collins however, dragged down defense stocks. The aerospace giant Boeing raised strong objections against the merger citing the deal’s potential to hinder competition in the aerospace supply chain market. This may have raised skepticism surrounding the deal.Meanwhile, keeping up with the trend, defense stocks continued to receive generous flow of funds from the Pentagon.Coming to the performance of the major indices of the Aerospace sector, in the last five trading sessions, the stocks ended up in the red zone. Notably, the S&P 500 Aerospace & Defense (Industry) Index dropped 2.6%, while the Dow Jones U.S. Aerospace & Defense Index dipped 2.3% during this period.Among last week’s highlights, defense primes Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc. (HII  -  Free Report), The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) and Orbital ATK, Inc.  secured notable contracts from the Department of Defense (DoD). Moreover, Rockwell Collins Inc. (COL  -  Free Report) and United Technologies Corp. (UTX  -  Free Report) finalized their merger deal.(Read Defense Stock Roundup for Sep 1, 2017 here)A Look Back at Last Week’s Key Stories1.

Per the deal, the former will be acquired by the latter for a total transaction value of $30 billion. The deal is projected to wrap up by the third quarter of 2018, depending on consents from Rockwell Collins’ shareowners and other customary closing conditions, including the receipt of required regulatory approvals.United Technologies expects the acquisition to be accretive to its adjusted earnings per share after the first full year, following the deal’s closure.

1099,NOC,"With 26% of the S&P 500 members having reported their quarterly numbers as of Jan 26, we are in the thick of the fourth-quarter earnings season. So far, the results reflect a positive trend, with an above average proportion of companies beating top- and bottom-line expectations.

For more details on quarterly releases, you can go through our latest Earnings Preview.Defense stocks remained on a growth trajectory in the fourth quarter, courtesy of the various defense policy initiatives adopted by President Trump. A steady flow of contracts from Pentagon also provided an impetus to the stocks.

1101,NOC,"Along with a new full slate of Q4 earnings results ahead of today’s opening bell, we also see Initial Jobless Claims reported for last week. The headline number of 233K is higher than the previous week by 17K claims (the previous week itself was revised down to 216K from 220K originally reported), but falls nicely within the comfortable range between 225K-250K jobless claims we’ve largely seen over the past couple years.Continuing claims fell last week to 1.937 million from an upwardly revised 1.965 million the previous week. The 4-week moving average now sits at 240K initial jobless claims per week, which smooths out a bit of the week-to-week volatility we’ve seen recently, going back to the hurricanes that ripped through the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico late last summer.

Revenues in the quarter of $12.9 billion beat estimates by a cool $1 billion, and continues its impressive string of bottom-line beats — now 12 straight quarters. Full-year guidance also looks robust, now at a range of $8.25-9.25 per share; the Zacks consensus estimate had been $8.02 per share. For more on CAT’s earnings, click here.3M also outperformed expectations on its top and bottom lines this morning, with $2.10 per share on $7.99 billion in revenues outpacing the $2.03 per share and $7.88 billion we were looking for. Full-year guidance was also ratcheted up significantly to $10.20-10.70 per share; the previous Zacks consensus was $9.83 per share. MMM shares are up 2.5% in the pre-market. For more on MMM’s earnings, click here.More airlines companies have also posted new earnings results: American (AAL  -  Free Report) posted 95 cents per share for a 2-cent beat on $10.6 billion in revenues that squeaked out a beat over the $10.58 billion expected. Southwest (LUV  -  Free Report) beat by a penny to 77 cents per share, and revenues of $5,274 million topped the $5,242 million in the Zacks consensus.Defense companies also hit the tape ahead of the bell: Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report) surpassed expectations to $2.82 per share versus the $2.75 expected, with revenues of $6.63 billion easily beat the $6.37 billion we were looking for.

1108,NOC,"Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report) has won a modification contract to exercise an option for providing class services in support of the Littoral Combat Ship program. The contract includes foreign military sales (FMS) to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.Contract DetailsValued at $22.7 million, this contract has been awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, DC. While the majority of the work will be carried out in Hampton, VA, the rest will be executed in Moorestown, NJ, and Washington, DC.Lockheed Martin will utilize FMS funds for the Navy to complete the work by July 2018.A Brief Note on LCSAn LCS is a type of relatively small surface vessel used for operations in the littoral zone. These are well designed to tackle rapidly changing global threats and provide a cost-effective solution.Our ViewLockheed Martin is the chief contractor of the U.S. Navy’s newest LCS. The program of building these Freedom-class ships involves 900 companies in 43 states.Although the Navy is most likely to purchase 52 LCS ships, government officials have asked them to reduce the count. Earlier, Defense Secretary Carter had made a proposal to the Navy for lowering the purchases to 40 ships. However, Navy officials have remained unchanged in their initial target of 52 ships.In fact, being the Pentagon’s prime defense contractor, Lockheed Martin enjoys a lion’s share of the aerospace-defense industry in the United States.Moreover, the fiscal 2018 defense policy has authorized the United States to spend $700 billion on defense. This, in turn, has enhanced the prospect of increased order flow from Pentagon for major defense contractors like Lockheed Martin, Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report), The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) and others.Considering the aforementioned developments, Lockheed Martin is expected to win more of such contracts in the long run.Price MovementLockheed Martin’s stock was up about 19% in a year, underperforming the broader industry’s gain of 36%. This could have been caused by the intense competition that the company faces for its broad portfolio of products and services domestically as well as internationally.Zacks RankLockheed Martin carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1109,NOC,"Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) Space Systems business unit recently secured a contract for procuring modified ballistic re-entry vehicle/re-entry vehicle separation modules.  Work related to this deal is expected to be over by Dec 31, 2022.Details of the DealValued at $80.6 million, the contract was awarded by the Missile Defense Agency, Huntsville, AL. The terms of the deal include development; production; storage and surveillance; maintenance of delivered hardware and software; and transportation of end items to the designated launch vehicle provider. Further this contract entitles Lockheed Martin to offer additional quantity, integration, analysis, and mission support.The entire work in connection to this contract will be executed in Huntsville, AL. Fiscal 2017 research, development, test and evaluation funds will be utilized to partially finance the task and the rest will be funded incrementally.A Brief Note on Re-Entry VehicleAs part of the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS), Lockheed Martin receives high-fidelity threat system ballistic missile performance requirements from the government and builds ballistic missile targets to meet those requirements and represent real-world threats. Such countermeasures are designed to increase the probability that the re-entry vehicle from the threat missile reaches its intended target.  These target practices are essential components of BMDS, as it tests the efficiency of the ballistic missiles and in turn keeps one ready in situations of adversities. Modified Ballistic Re-Entry Vehicle is one of the components of such target programs.Our ViewWith increasing geopolitical tension across the globe, it has become a necessary mandate for nations to stock up their arsenals. For the United States, the frequent missile tests conducted by North Korea have been sending a strong message of hostility toward America for the past few months. As a result, the latter has been strengthening its missile stack in recent period. To strengthen its missile power, more target practices are needed which in turn has pushed the demand for such re-entry vehicles. The latest contract reaffirms this fact.With Lockheed Martin being the largest defense contractor worldwide and given its combat-proven military equipments, we can expect more such contracts from the Pentagon, which in turn will substantially boost the company’s growth trajectory.Moreover, the rocket and missile market is projected to grow from $55.53 billion in 2017 to $70 billion by 2022, at a CAGR of 4.74% during 2017-2022 (as per Markets and Markets). Further, the recently approved fiscal 2018 defense policy bill worth $700 billion also buoys optimism for investing in major defense stocks. Therefore the time is ripe to add defense primes, like Lockheed Martin, The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report), Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report) and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report) in your watchlist.Price MovementLockheed Martin’s stock has returned 19.9% over a year, underperforming the 30.1% rally of the industry it belongs to. This may have been caused by the company’s F-35 program, which despite being a prime project of the U.S. government has been repeatedly criticised for being overtly expensive.  Zacks Rank Lockheed Martin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1110,NOC,"Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) business unit, Rotary and Mission Systems has won a modification contract to exercise an option period for the procurement of Technical Insertion (TI) 18-20 Acoustic Rapid Commercial Off-the-Shelf Insertion (A-RCI) engineering services.Contract DetailsValued at $122.3 million, this contract has been awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, DC. The majority of the work will be carried out in Manassas, VA, while the rest will be executed in Clearwater, FL.Lockheed Martin will utilize fiscal 2018 research, development test and evaluation funds for the Navy to complete the work by December 2018.A Brief Note on A-RCI SystemsA-RCI is an open-architecture sonar system that uses legacy sensors. It also replaces central processors with commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) computer technology and software within submarines.  This system helps the U.S. Navy in searching, detecting and tracking submarines and surface vessels in open-ocean and littoral sea environments without being counter-detected. Additionally, it facilitates covert execution of Naval Special Warfare missions as well as under-ice operations.In the 1990s, Lockheed Martin unveiled A-RCI Systems that allowed frequent hardware and software upgrades. The system was highly effective and offered improved acoustic quieting measures at a far lower cost. Notably, the TI 18-20 A-RCI engineering services provide engineering development to support modernization requirements.Our ViewWith the rapid rise in terrorist attacks over the last decade, the U.S. Navy’s focus has shifted to littoral waters, the shallow areas near coastlines. In fact, patrolling in these areas has become need of the hour to defend against small subs, underwater mines and fast attack boats. Consequently, timely detection and localization of quiet subs in the especially noisy shallow-water sonar field has made the A-RCI submarine sonar system all the more critical. Additionally, constant upgrades of the system have made it more valuable for the nation’s naval base and an attractive choice of defense equipment for the U.S. allied countries.Furthermore, Lockheed Martin's Rotary and Mission Systems business carries out some of the company's high-profile programs. These include the Aegis Combat System, Littoral Combat Ship, MH-60 helicopter avionics along with military and commercial orders. The segment generated revenues of $3.4 billion in the third quarter of 2017, reflecting almost 27.9% of its total revenues.Markedly, being the Pentagon’s prime defense contractor, Lockheed Martin enjoys a lion’s share of the aerospace-defense industry in the United States.Moreover, the recently passed fiscal 2018 defense policy that authorized the United States’ defense spending worth $700 billion has enhanced the prospect of increased order flow from Pentagon for major defense contractors like Lockheed Martin, Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report), The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) and others.Considering the aforementioned developments, the company is expected to win more of such contracts in days ahead, given that most of its programs are the top priorities of Pentagon.Price MovementLockheed Martin’s stock was up about 18.9% in a year, underperforming the broader industry’s gain of 34.3%.

1111,NOC,"Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) business unit, Sikorsky Aircraft, recently secured a modification contract for supplying consumable spare parts used in various weapon systems. The original deal was a five-year base contract with one five-year option period for numerous aircraft platform spare supply parts.About the DealValued at $49 million, this contract has been awarded by the Defense Logistics Agency Aviation, Richmond, VI. Sikorsky will offer the spare parts for the U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps and foreign military sales.The contract will utilize fiscal 2018 defense working capital funds to finance the work, which will be executed in Connecticut. It is scheduled to be completed by Jun 30, 2020.Factors in Favor of Lockheed MartinBeing Pentagon’s prime contractor, Lockheed Martin offers a diverse portfolio of global aerospace, defense, security and advanced technologies. The company’s Global Supply Chain Services (“GSCS”) offer hardware replacements for both structural and consumable parts along with a certified vendor program.For over 10 years, GSCS has been providing aircraft tires to all Navy and Marine Corps aviation activities worldwide. Within this period, the company’s performance included a 100% fill rate and on-time global delivery of 98.4%, resulting in a 400% reduction in retail inventories for Navy and Marine Corps activities within the United States.Under various programs, GSCS also provides crucial support to the three U.S. Air Force depots by maintaining a constant supply of miscellaneous, small consumable parts in more than 295,000 parts bins with 90,000 unique line items at a bin fill rate of over 99.78%. In terms of international business as well, GSCS offers support services to 55 international and commercial customers, with over 40 years of experience.Our ViewIn November 2015, Lockheed Martin had purchased Sikorsky Aircraft from United Technologies Corp. (UTX  -  Free Report). The deal boosted Lockheed Martin’s military helicopter business and strengthened its position as the world’s largest defense contractor. Also, this acquisition added Sikorsky’s world-known aircraft, Black Hawk and a handful of combat and commercial choppers to Lockheed Martin's helicopter product line.Going ahead, management expects to witness improved cash flows from the Sikorsky business unit in 2018 indicating possibilities of this business’ expansion in the near term. We believe generous fund flows from Pentagon, in the form of contracts, like the latest one, can certainly help the company achieve its desired business expansion, going ahead.Price PerformanceShares of Lockheed Martin have rallied 17.4% over a year, underperforming the industry’s 34.5% gain. This underperformance can be attributable to the earlier budget cuts that might have put pressure on the top line as well as intense competition from some of the largest defense primes like The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) and Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC  -  Free Report).  Zacks RankLockheed Martin carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1112,NOC,"Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT  -  Free Report) announced that it is one of the six companies to receive the Aerospace Systems Air Platform Technology Research program contract from the U.S. Air Force. The contract has a ceiling value of $499 million. It is the third company to receive this award from Pentagon.Details of the ContractPer the terms of the contract, the company will be responsible for providing quality research for affordable, revolutionary capabilities for the warfighter. The company expects to complete the task by 2025. The work will be carried out at the company’s Fort Worth, TX facility. The company will be obligated with $100,000 from the fiscal 2017 research and development funds at the time of the award.Lockheed Martin’s Aeronautics SegmentAs the largest defense contractor in the world, Lockheed Martin invests in the research and development of new and existing products. The aeronautics segment of the company is engaged in designing, research and development, systems integration, production and support of advanced military aircraft and related technologies. This segment is busy with major programs comprising F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter, C-130 Hercules, F-16 Fighting Falcon, F-22 Raptor and C-5M Super Galaxy.  It generated revenues of $5.2 billion in the second quarter, reflecting 40.9% of the total revenue.Our ViewThe proposed budget hike for fiscal 2018 by President Trump reflected a 10% increase over the current base budget level of the current year, hinting at the U.S. government to spend more on defense primes like Lockheed Martin, The Boeing Co. (BA  -  Free Report), Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC  -  Free Report), Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report) and others. More recently, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the 2018 defense policy bill, reflecting an expenditure level of $696 billion. This easily surpassed the nation’s current spending caps, which, enacted in 2011, limited annual military spending to $549 billion. It even exceeded President Trump’s defense budget request proposed this March. If enacted, all these budgetary updates will immensely boost this defense prime’s business growth.Additionally, regular contracts from the different verticals of the U.S. Defense, has enabled Lockheed Martin to become a strong cash generator. This has aided the company to take important cash deployment decisions. For the second quarter of 2017, the company generated cash from operations worth $1.54 billion, up 4.8% year over year.Price MovementShares of Lockheed Martin have returned 13.6% in the last six months, underperforming the industry’s growth of 16.7% in the same time frame.Too much dependence on F-35 program and intense competition might hurt the company’s growth trajectory.Zacks RanksLockheed Martin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1114,NOC,"Javelin, a joint venture (JV) formed by defense majors Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report) and Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report), recently won a modification contract for procuring Javelin containerized all-up rounds, command launch units, Javelin vehicle launcher-electronics and associated non-recurring engineering. Work related to the deal is scheduled to be over by Aug 31, 2020.Valued at $133.9 million, the contract was awarded by the U.S. Army Contracting Command, Redstone Arsenal, AL. The deal falls under the foreign military sales (FMS) program of the United States and will aid nations like Jordan, Qatar and Taiwan.Work will be carried out in Tuscon, AZ. The project will use other procurement funds of fiscal 2017.A Brief Note on JavelinJavelin is the world's first one-man-portable, fire-and-forget, multipurpose missile system. This compact, lightweight missile was designed for one-soldier operations in all situations. It enhances direct-fire capability against armored vehicles, buildings and field fortifications. Armed forces all over the world have adopted Javelin. In fact, it is currently serving the U.S. Army and Marine Corps as well as 15 allied militaries.Raytheon and Lockheed Martin have been producing the Javelin handheld missile system through the JV since as early as the mid-1990s. Impressively, this combat proven weapon system boasts a reliability rate of more than 94%.Our ViewWhile, Raytheon is one of the best-positioned large-cap defense players in the United States, Lockheed Martin is the nation’s largest defense contractor. FMS contracts is a vital growth driver for both the defense majors.Notably, both Raytheon and Lockheed Martin are two of the three major contractors involved in the $110 billion arms deal that President Trump signed in May, with Saudi Arabia.Going ahead, Raytheon continues to see significant overseas demand for early warning radars, as well as for TPY-2 X-Band radars between 2018 and2020. To meet this demand, Raytheon is upgrading its radar systems. On the other hand, the U.S. administration in March announced plans to pursue the $5 billion sale of 19 F-16 jets to Bahrain– a deal which got stalled owing to human rights concerns last year. On approval, the Bahrain deal will benefit Lockheed Martin substantially.Therefore, it is evident that both the companies enjoy substantial demand for their weaponries in the foreign market and given the rising geopolitical conflicts worldwide, demand is likely to escalate in the days ahead. The latest contract is reflective of the rise in demand, which willdrivegrowth for the likes of Raytheon and Lockheed Martin.Price MovementLockheed Martin’s stock has returned 19.8% in the last one year, underperforming the 34.8% rally of the industry it belongs to.

1117,NOC,"The Boeing Co. (BA  -  Free Report) recently announced that it is one of the six companies to receive the Aerospace Systems Air Platform Technology Research program contract from the U.S. Air Force, which has a ceiling value of $499 million.Notably, Boeing is the final company to receive this award from Pentagon.Contract DetailsPer the contract, the company will be responsible for providing quality research for affordable, revolutionary capabilities for the warfighter. It was awarded by Air Force Research Laboratory, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, OH.Boeing expects to complete the task by Aug 31, 2025. The work will be carried out at the company’s Hazelwood, MS facility, and will utilize the fiscal 2017 research and development funds to finish the task.Why Boeing?Boeing is one of the major players in the defense business and stands out among its peers by virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and solid backlog. In particular, among other defense equipments the company’s key forte has been combat-proven aircraft. It also started developing military aerial refueling and strategic transport aircraft, of late.Notably, with its proven expertise in aerospace programs, Boeing has been consistently securing a huge number of contracts from the Pentagon.For instance, in August, the company clinched a contract valued at $323.5 million, to supply spare parts of F/A-18 A-F and F/A-18 aircraft from the Defense Logistics Agency Aviation.. Again, it won a modification contract, valued at $222.5 million, for eight CH-47F new build helicopters. The deal aims to support the Royal Saudi Land Forces Aviation Command. To this end, we expect the recently won contract to add further impetus to the company’s growth trajectory.Moreover, the proposed budget hike for fiscal 2018 by President Trump reflected a 10% increase over the current base budget level of the current year, hinting at the U.S. government to spend more on defense primes like Boeing, Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report), Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC  -  Free Report), Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report) and others.Further, the U.S. House of Representatives have passed the 2018 defense policy bill recently, reflecting an expenditure level of $696 billion. The figure easily surpassed the nation’s current spending caps, which enacted in 2011, limited annual military spending to $549 billion. It also exceeded President Trump’s defense budget request proposed this March.If enacted, all these budgetary updates are expected to immensely boost this defense prime’s, along with others’, business growth in the near term.Price MovementShares of Boeing have surged 76.9% over the last 12 months, outperforming the broader industry’s gain of 37%. This might have been driven by the company’s strong balance sheet and cash flows that provide financial flexibility in matters of incremental dividend, ongoing share repurchases and earnings accretive acquisitions.Zacks RankBoeing currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1119,NOC,"On Sunday, North Korea raised global geopolitical tensions after it claimed it had conducted a sixth and substantially more powerful nuclear test. This announcement also significantly increased pressure on the Trump administration, representing the most serious foreign affairs crisis in years.Much of this depends on how the United States ultimately responds to this latest provocation from North Korea. However, initial reactions suggest that policymakers are still weighing their options and are likely to issue a studied and measured response.This is why the impact of this event on the U.S. bourses will largely be limited to the short term. At the same time, a flight toward safe haven assets and another surge in popularity of defense stocks is likely as developments surrounding North Korea continue to unfold.Mattis Issues Stern WarningOn Sep 3, North Korea claimed that it successfully tested a hydrogen bomb capable of being fitted onto an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). In a televised statement, the country claimed that the test was a “perfect success” and guaranteed that North Korea now possessed a credible nuclear warhead.Reacting to the test, U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis issued a stern warning to North Korea. Mattis said the errant country would have to face a tremendous military response if it indulged in an act of aggression against the United States or its allies.Over the last few weeks, the Trump administration has hinted that it will explore further steps to isolate North Korea’s economy following its recent actions, especially with regard to testing of missiles and nuclear weapons. Future attempts to curb the country economically could include increasing pressure on China to stop its oil imports to North Korea, a move which could cripple the country in several ways.Defense Stocks to Gain Apart from economic sanctions, the prospects of U.S. military action against North Korea have also increased following Mattis’ strong response to the nuclear test. Given such a backdrop, U.S. defense stocks are likely to mop up considerable gains in the days ahead. Reports from South Korea hinting at further missile tests by its Northern neighbor, including an ICBM launch, are likely to provide further impetus to this sector.This in keeping with gains enjoyed by defense stocks in the aftermath of last week’s missile launch over Japan. On Aug 29, North Korea fired a ballistic missile which flew over Japan's Hokkaido island before crashing into the sea. Following this event, stocks such as Raytheon (RTN  -  Free Report) General Dynamics (GD  -  Free Report), Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report) and Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report) moved north. Each of these stocks have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Popularity of Safe Haven Assets to RiseMeanwhile, South Korea carried out live-fire drills, intended to exhibit the country’s military strength, as a response to the nuclear test. Additionally, it is speeding up the deployment of the U.S. manufactured THAAD missile defense system. It comes as no surprise, therefore, that the popularity of safe haven assets is on the rise.Since Sunday’s test, treasuries, gold, the yen and the Swiss franc have all found favor with investors. But such a state of affairs is unlikely to last beyond a point. In the past, investors have participated in a short term selloff and rushed toward safe haven assets in the aftermath of such an event. Subsequently, they have bought the dip soon after receiving indications that tensions have eased or are unlikely to escalate further.In ConclusionNorth Korea’s latest nuclear test is likely to add to U.S. investors’ woes in the week ahead. But this set to be a short term phenomenon, given that U.S. military action in the region still seems unlikely. Given such prospects, markets are likely to focus on strong economic fundamentals and bullish earnings performance of stocks. This means that a major stock slide, even in the midterm, seems unlikely. Stocks are likely to return to their winning ways once tensions begin to recede.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!                   It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

This supersonic, medium-range, air-launched tactical missiles are being used by U.S. Navy and allied strike aircraft, and are compatible with all variants such as F/A-18, Tornado, EA-18G, F-16, EA-6B and F-35.Orders & Backlog of Orbital ATKOrbital ATK is one of the trusted contractors for the U.S. Department of Defense. Owing to its diverse product offering, the company continues to win contracts from its wide customer base. In second-quarter 2017, the company received $1,400 million in new firm and option orders. Total backlog was nearly $15.4 billion, up 4% year over year, out of which, firm backlog was $9.5 billion, up 10% year over year.Other than contracts from different verticals of the U.S. Defense, the company also received a $90-million contract from Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report) to supply parts for the B-2 Spirit stealth bomber in May. This partnership with Northrop Grumman is expected to benefit the company’s Aerospace Structures Division.Defense Industry ScenarioThe global unrest associated with the rising terror activities has forced most of the nations to give additional attention to their defense infrastructure. Moreover, the recent tension between the United States and North Korea has created increased opportunity for the defense industry to gain from the consequences. President Trump has proposed a 10% hike in defense spending of fiscal 2018. As a result, the major aerospace and defense companies such as Orbital ATK, General Dynamics (GD  -  Free Report), Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report) and many others continue to receive orders from different verticals of the U.S. Defense.Price MovementShares of Orbital ATK have returned 18.4%, compared with the industry’s gain of 14.7% in the last six months.The company’s performance is expected to be driven by diverse product offerings and rising backlog.Zacks RankOrbital ATK currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1121,NOC,"Following fresh tensions over North Korea’s fanatic militant activities, this time targeting Japan, majority of the U.S. defense stocks moved north on Aug 30. Notably, North Korea fired a ballistic missile which flew over Japan's Hokkaido island before crashing in to the sea.This sudden move made investors skeptical owing to which major world market indices, at the onset of Aug 29 trading session, dipped. However, by the end of the day, the U.S. stocks regained their footing.The S&P 500 ended the session by inching up 0.1%, while both the Nasdaq Composite and Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.3%. Though investors were initially unnerved by the mounting tension due to the missile launch and Hurricane Harvey’s devastation, the day eventually closed on a promising note. U.S. administration’s aggressive defense strategy probably saved the day for the stocks.How Did North Korea Justify?North Korea’s President Kim Jong-Un justified the move as an action to counter the United States and South Korean military drills. Per major media sources, Kim maintained that the missile launch was his first step of conducting military operations in the Pacific and more such actions can be expected, going forward.Moreover, North Korea's official news agency KCNA claimed that the move marks the anniversary of the disputed Japan-Korea treaty of 1910, which saw Japanese forces annex the Korean peninsula.South Korea and U.S. RetaliatesA high alert has been issued in Japan following North Korea’s missile launch. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe strongly condemned the action as a “reckless act” and a grave threat to the country’s security. He also reminded North Korea of the U.S.’ cordial relationship with Japan. In response, a few hours after the attack on Japan, South Korea dropped bombs at the Taebaek Pilsung Firing Range in North Korea’s Gangwon province. Through this South Korea exhibited its military strength to dent the opposition’s confidence when needed.Further, North Korea’s missile attack on Japan, was severely criticized by the U.S. President Trump. He sent a strong message to his Korean counterpart, saying “all options are on the table"" indicating a possible counter missile launch in the near term.Stocks in FocusCross-border tensions between the United States and North Korea have escalated manifold in the last few months. The last month, in particular, has seen the highest tension between the two countries. It reached its peak at this month’s onset, providing an impetus to a number of defense majors to scale new all-time highs.The fresh altercation yesterday boded well for the U.S. defense bellwethers as rising geopolitical tensions always prompt the government to strengthen it arsenals.Here we have sorted five defense primes that witnessed more than 1% gain in their share price in the last trading session following North Korea’s missile attack on Japan. Banking on the below mentioned bullish trends boasted by these stocks, investing in them seem to be a prudent choice.Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report) is one of the largest aerospace and defense companies in the U.S. with a diversified line of military products, including missiles, radars, sensors, surveillance and reconnaissance equipment, communication and information systems, naval systems, air traffic control systems and technical services.In the last trading session, this defense prime’s share price gained 2.2%, maximum among other defense majors.

1122,NOC,"Shares of companies with ties to U.S. defense spending, including Raytheon (RTN  -  Free Report), jumped on Tuesday as tensions surrounding North Korea escalated once again, this time in the wake of a missile launch over Japan.North Korea North Korea launched a missile over the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido, which eventually landed in the Pacific Ocean. Pyongyang missile launches have become all too commonplace, but the most recent one over Japan was the first of its kind in almost a decade.Kim Jong Un’s regime had never launched a missile over a major foreign population center—his deceased father, Kim Jong Il last fired over Japan’s main islands in 2009. The newest provocation caused not only heightened responses from world leaders, including Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, but helped to send markets and indexes down as well.“A missile launch across Japan is an outrageous act that poses an unprecedented, grave and serious threat, and significantly undermines the peace and security of the region,” Prime Minister Abe said in a statement. “The Government has lodged a firm protest against North Korea. We ask the United Nations Security Council to convene an emergency meeting.”Japanese Defense Minister Itsunori Onodera said he will ask for funds to begin to utilize a land-based version of an anti-missile system used by U.S. battleships called the Aegis Ashore, according to the Wall Street Journal. One unit of the defense system, which is manufactured by Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report), costs about $80 billion.The escalating tensions out of North Korea also prompted President Donald Trump to respond.“The world has received North Korea’s latest message loud and clear: this regime has signaled its contempt for its neighbors, for all members of the United Nations, and for minimum standards of acceptable international behavior,” President Trump said in a statement released by the White House.“Threatening and destabilizing actions only increase the North Korean regime’s isolation in the region and among all nations of the world. All options are on the table.”Defense StocksOn the back of escalating North Korean tensions, U.S. defense-based stocks saw gains on Tuesday. Shares of Raytheon (RTN  -  Free Report) climbed over 1.80% to touch a new all-time high of $182.05 a share. Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report) stock jumped by 1.35% and just missed matching its all-time high.Shares of Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report) and Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) both gained around 1%, while General Dynamics (GD  -  Free Report) rose 1.25%.Defense ETFs,including the PowerShares Aerospace & Defense ETF (PPA  -  Free Report) and the SPDR S&P Aerospace & Defense ETF (XAR  -  Free Report), both saw their stock prices rise by over 1%. The iShares US Aerospace & Defense ETF (ITA  -  Free Report) gained 0.90%.Other Movement Tied To North KoreaAside from the upward movement by military defense stocks, companies and indexes in the region fell.The iShares MSCI South Korea Index Fund ETF (EWY  -  Free Report), which tracks South Korean companies, fell by 0.84%. The Nikkei-225 index, which tracks top-rated Japanese companies listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, closed down 0.45%.

1123,NOC,"Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT  -  Free Report) announced that its aeronautics business segment has secured a $47.8 million contract from the U.S. Air Force.Per the terms of the contract, the company is required to provide engineering and technical services for F-16 aircraft. Work related to the deal will be carried out at the Hill Air Force Base, UT; Toledo, OH; Tucson, AZ and McEntire Joint National Guard Base, SC along with 12 other international locations such as Bahrain, Pakistan, Chile, Jordan, Turkey, Morocco, Taiwan, Oman, Egypt, Iraq, Thailand and Indonesia. Operations are expected to be completed by June 2020.The F-16V, which is the latest F-16 configuration, comes with numerous enhancement designs to make the F-16 aircraft one of the top choices for the international security forces. The latest version is equipped with Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar, a modern commercial off-the-shelf (COTS)-based avionics subsystem, a large format, high-resolution display and a high volume and speed data bus.Importance of Foreign Military SalesForeign Military Sales (FMS) is a program with which the U.S. government assists defense companies in selling related articles and services to other governments or international customers. The U.S. Department of Defense thus works as an intermediary between manufacturers and foreign customers.FMS helps in extending military ties between the United States and other military governments and helps U.S. allies to contribute efficiently in joint missions. The FMS contracts support the top line of the U.S. defense companies when there is a drop in domestic orders.Foreign Military Sales Aids LockheedIn March 2017, President Donald Trump’s administration said that it will go forward with the sale of 19 Lockheed Martin F-16 jets to Bahrain worth $5 billion. This deal was earlier stalled by the Obama Administration owing to the human rights concerns. This gave a huge boost to this product line for the company. (Read More: Trump Admin to Pursue Lockheed's F-16 Jet Sale to Bahrain)Additionally, the company has been witnessing strong demand for its equipment, ranging from C-130J aircraft in France and Germany, helicopters in Poland and missile defense systems in the Asia-Pacific, Europe and Middle East regions.Moreover, in the month of May, Trump signed an arms deal worth $110 billion with Saudi Arabia. Notably, Lockheed Martin seemed to have garnered the majority of this huge pact, with Saudi Arabia set to procure its integrated air and missile defense, combat ship, tactical aircraft and rotary wing technologies and programs for $28 billion.Other than the foreign military sales, the proposed hike in the 2018 defense budget is also expected to boost the performance of defense behemoths like Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics (GD  -  Free Report), The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report) among others.Price MovementShares of Lockheed Martin have gained 13.1%, outperforming the industry’s gain of 12% in the last six months.As the largest defense contractor in the world, Lockheed Martin continues to be a strong cash generator. The recently passed defense policy bill for 2018, with a promise of $696 billion budget, is also expected to boost growth of this defense prime.Zacks RankLockheed Martin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1124,NOC,"Defense bellwether Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) Rotary and Mission Systems (RMS) business unit recently secured a contract for the development and production of a digital receiver exciter for the AN/TPS-59A(V)3 Radar system. Work related to the deal is scheduled to be over by Jan 31, 2021.Details of the dealValued at $25.3 million, the contract was awarded by the Marine Corps System Command, Quantico, VA. However the maximum value of the agreement can reach up to $46.7 million, on exercise of options included in the deal.Majority of the work will be executed in Liverpool, NY, while the remaining at Atlanta, GA and Clearwater, FL. Lockheed Martin will utilize fiscal 2016 research, development, test and evaluation (Marine Corps) funds to complete the contract. A Brief Note on AN/TPS-59A(V)3 Radar systemLockheed Martin’s AN/TPS-59A(V)3 is a long-range 3-D ground-based air surveillance radar.The radar, the latest version of the TPS-59 variety fielded in 1985, can detect and track air-breathing targets like aircraft and cruise missiles as far away as 300 miles. It can also detect tactical ballistic missiles as far away as 400 miles. AN/TPS offers 360-degree coverage to elevations of nearly 200 miles.Developed for the United States’ Ballistic Missile Defense Organization and the Marine Corps, the TPS-59 (V) 3 is designed to operate with HAWK and Patriot systems. The radar has been designed to be transported by truck, helicopter, or C-130 cargo plane rapidly.Our ViewLockheed Martin’s radar systems offer advanced precision targeting, navigation, threat detection and next generation intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities. In fact, the company’s radars and sensors have been designed and delivered to every armed service and operational environment. Thanks to its advanced radar systems, the company’s RMS unit enjoys a steady flow of contracts from the Pentagon. Evidently, Lockheed Martin won a contract worth $1.58 billion from the U.S. Army to supply radars that track incoming rocket, mortar and artillery fire in March 2017.In the second quarter of 2017, the RMS business segment generated sales of $3.4 billion, which represented 26.8% of Lockheed Martin’s total sales and witnessed a 3% rise from the year-ago quarter figure. Currently, the company is developing the next generation radars and sensors that can detect, track and identify threats quickly. Considering this, more such radar-based contracts like the recent one can be expected for Lockheed Martin. This in turn will further boost sales growth for the RMS unit.Moreover, in the budget proposals for additional fiscal 2017 appropriations worth $30 billion, the White House requested an extra base budget of $24.9 billion and Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) budget worth $5.1 billion. Given the current U.S. administration being in favor of higher defense spending, there is a high chance for this proposal getting approved in the U.S. House as well as the Senate. This in turn will definitely improve the growth prospects of defense majors like Lockheed Martin, The Boeing Co. (BA  -  Free Report), General Dynamics (GD  -  Free Report) and Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC  -  Free Report) in the nation.Price MovementLockheed Martin’s stock moved up 24% in the last one year, underperforming the broader industry’s gain of 36.4%.This could be because the earlier budget cuts have put pressure on the top line while the present defense budget is more in favor of the sector. Furthermore, we believe that budget deficits and political uncertainty might make future defense budgets vulnerable to cutbacks.Zacks RankLockheed Martin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1126,NOC,"L3 Technologies, Inc. (LLL  -  Free Report) hit a new 52-week high of $209.98 during yesterday’s trading session before closing a tad lower at $209.46. The stock has delivered a one-year return of about 40.9%.Over the past 52 weeks, L3 Technologies’ share price has ranged from a low of $146.88 to a high of $209.98. Average volume of shares traded over the last three months is approximately 0.55 million.What is Driving L3 Technologies?L3 Technologies is a consistent performer and has reported positive earnings surprises in each of the last four quarters with an average beat of 9.13%. Its expected long-term earnings growth rate (three to five years) is 6.78%.Thanks to its quality product offerings, the company continuously receives contracts from the U.S. defense establishments and foreign governments. Funded backlog at the end of third- quarter 2017 was $9 billion, reflecting sequential growth of 5.8%.Apart from generating substantial organic revenue growth, thanks to its varied product range, L3 Technologies gains from inorganic growth. The strategic acquisitions made by the company have widened its market and created more opportunities.In addition to its strong presence in the U.S. defense space, the company continues to enjoy a steady flow of Foreign Military Sales (FMS) contracts. The company is expected to benefit from a large addressable international market with sales directly to foreign allied governments and under FMS agreements between the U.S. government and foreign governments.Other Defense Players Moving UpTrump’s presidency has been a boon for the  Zacks Aerospace sector , which was grappling with the budget sequestration implemented by the prior government. The fiscal 2018 (FY18) defense budget, reflecting a 10% hike from the FY16 level, was a major forerunner for this sector’s growth at the beginning of 2017.  Notably, the FY18 defense policy bill worth $700 billion that extensively surpassed Trump's budget request took stocks to new heights.The increase in the defense budget will also result in new orders for the major defense contractors and will have a positive impact on their performance and prices. Apart from L3 Technologies, other defense operators like Textron Inc. (TXT  -  Free Report), Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT  -  Free Report) and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report) also touched their respective 52-week highs yesterday.Price MovementL3 Technologies has returned 40.9% in the past year, which is in line with the industry’s gain but much better than the S&P 500’s return of 23.2%.The company’s performance is driven by its non-platform-centric focus and broad diversification of programs.Zacks RankL3 Technologies has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1127,NOC,"Raytheon Company’s (RTN  -  Free Report) Integrated Defense Systems (IDS) business segment recently secured a contract worth $641.6 million to perform Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) test related activities for multiple radar platforms. Work related to this will be carried out in Huntsville, AL and Colorado Springs, CO.Details of the DealThe contract was awarded by the Missile Defense Agency, Huntsville, AL.  The BMDS test involves planning, executing, and analyzing sensor performance in BMDS flight tests and ground tests for each test event defined in the BMDS integrated master test plan. It also includes sensors modeling and simulation activities to include Open Systems Architecture Sensor Model (OSM) and Open Systems Architecture Signal Injector (OSI) development and maintenance, integration of OSI with hardware-in-the-loop radar representation, integration of OSI and OSM with the simulation framework, verification and validation support, and stakeholder/event support.Raytheon will utilize fiscal 2017 and 2018 research, development, test and evaluation funds to partly finance the task. The ordering period is from Jan 12, 2018, through Jan 11, 2023, with a one-year option period provided in the contract.Features of IDS UnitRaytheon’s IDS segment enjoys a leading position in integrated air and missile defense; large land- and sea-based radar solutions; command, control, communications, computers, cyber and intelligence solutions; and naval combat and ship electronic systems. The segment delivers combat-proven performance against the complete spectrum of airborne and ballistic missile threats and is a world leader in the technology, development, and production of sensors and mission systems.Our ViewThe United States and developed nations of Europe already enjoy a dominant position in the defense industry. With increasing geo-political tensions across the globe, Asian nations like India and Japan have started to take initiatives to ramp up their arsenal. With rapid upgradation in technology, missile defense has emerged as an integral part of defense strategy for all countries.As a result, missile-makers like Raytheon, Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC  -  Free Report), Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report) and Orbital ATK  have ample growth opportunities in the global missile defense market. Evidently, the missile defense systems market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 2.18%, from 2017 to 2027 with a value of $41 billion (according to ReportLinker).Raytheon has a strong forte in the multi-billion dollar missile defense market. Its proven interceptors, radars and space sensors provide protection against ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, aircraft and other threats.Anticipating stronger bookings, Raytheon raised its fourth-quarter and full-year sales outlook for the IDS segment. Impressively, the company also expects to witness uplift in this segment during 2018, to which we believe notable contract wins like the latest one will contribute substantially.Price MovementRaytheon’s shares moved up about 35.3% in a year’s time compared with the broader industry’s gain of 34.8%. The outperformance may have been driven by rising demand for the company’s missile systems from the Gulf countries and Asia Pacific, apart from domestic customers.  Zacks Rank Raytheon carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1128,NOC,"Northrop Grumman Corp.’s (NOC  -  Free Report) unit, Northrop Grumman Systems Corp., has secured a contract to offer logistics support services for government-owned fixed wing fleet performing special electronic mission aircraft missions.Details of the DealThe contract, which is valued at $116.9 million, has been awarded by the U.S. Army Contracting Command, Redstone Arsenal, AL.Work is scheduled to be completed by Feb 28, 2027, and will be performed in Herndon, VA. The deal will use fiscal 2017 operations and maintenance (Army) funds.Our ViewBeing the fourth-largest U.S. defense contractor, Northrop Grumman supplies a broad array of products and services to the U.S. Department of Defense, including defense electronics, unmanned aircraft and missile defense. In addition, this Falls Church, VA-based company continues to witness strong demand for its unmanned air systems on a global scale.Meanwhile, Donald Trump’s presidency seems to have created a win-win situation for the Aerospace and Defense majors like Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report), The Boeing Co. (BA  -  Free Report) and Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report). Evidently, the outlook for various stocks in this space has improved manifold in the past months on the back of enhanced spending promises that Trump had made in his latest America First budget.Specifically, the fiscal 2017 budget proposal reflected an annual increase of approximately $2.2 billion more than the year-ago budget. Again, the Trump administration’s request for additional fiscal 2017 appropriations included an additional base budget of $24.9 billion and Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) budget worth $5.1 billion.The proposed budget hike for fiscal 2018 by President Trump reflected a 10% increase more than the current base budget level, hinting at the U.S. government to spend more on defense.Also, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the 2018 defense policy bill recently, reflecting an expenditure level of $696 billion. It exceeded President Trump’s defense budget request proposed this March.If enacted, all these budgetary updates will immensely boost business growth of all the defense giants including Northrop Grumman. A moderate flow of funds from the Pentagon further added to the optimism.Going forward, we expect the increased spending to be allocated to certain key areas that might unlock higher opportunities for Northrop Grumman.Price MovementNorthrop Grumman’s stock has rallied 27.6% in the last year, underperforming the industry’s gain of 39.9%. The downturn was owing to higher operating expenses that continue to partially impact the company’s profit margin. Also, Northrop Grumman may be challenged by economic and political factors. Furthermore, in a highly competitive environment customers might get attracted to similar products offered by its peers at a lower price, which is a major concern.Zacks RankNorthrop Grumman currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1131,NOC,"Defense prime Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT  -  Free Report) secured a contract for the construction of a littoral combat ship (LCS). Work related to this deal is expected to be over by October 2023.Notably, an LCS is a type of relatively small surface vessel intended for operations in the littoral zone. These are well designed to tackle the rapidly changing global threats and provide a cost-effective solution.Details of the DealValued at $584.2 million, the contract has been awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C.Per the contract, the company will provide related LCS class services and material, along with integrated data environment support. The agreement also includes options for the construction of additional LCS, class services and post-delivery availability support. The Navy expects to order additional LCS class ships in the future.Per the terms of the agreement, majority of the work will be executed in Marinette, WS. The remaining part will be carried out at other regions of the United States.The deal will utilize fiscal 2017 shipbuilding and conversion (Navy) funds for construction of one fiscal 2017 LCS; and fiscal 2016 shipbuilding and conversion (Navy) for LCS class services and integrated data environment support.What’s Favoring Lockheed?Lockheed Martin is the chief contractor of the U.S. Navy’s newest LCS. The program of building these Freedom-class ships involves 900 companies in 43 states.It is important to note here that the Navy is most likely to purchase 52 LCS ships, but government officials have told the Navy to cut that number. Defense Secretary Carter had earlier made a proposal to the Navy to reduce purchases to 40. Navy officials have however, remained unchanged in their initial target of 52 ships.Going forward, we expect the latest contract to substantially boost the company’s growth trajectory.  Also, the defense prime remains confident of winning more of such contracts in the near term.Price MovementLockheed Martin’s stock has returned 35.7% in the last year, underperforming the 52.9% rally of the industry it belongs to. This may have been caused by the company’s F-35 program, which despite being a prime project of the U.S. government has been repeatedly criticised for being overtly expensive. Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderLockheed Martin carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Better-ranked stocks in the aerospace and defense sector include Engility Holdings, Inc. (EGL  -  Free Report), Leidos Holdings, Inc. (LDOS  -  Free Report) and Northrop Grumman Corp.

1132,NOC,"The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter 2017 deliveries, wherein commercial shipments were up 7.4% on a year-over-year basis. However, defense shipments were 12% lower than the year-ago figure.Commercial DeliveriesThe year-over-year improvement was primarily driven by higher deliveries of 737 model. Boeing’s other models 777, 787 and 767 jets, registered marginal year-over-year drop in deliveries. In the reported quarter, the company delivered 202 airplanes.Delivery of the single-aisle 737 jets improved to 145 from 120 a year ago. Shipments of the 777 and 787 Dreamliners were 16 and 35 compared with 22 and 36 in the year-ago period, respectively. The company delivered two 767 jets compared with five in the year-ago quarter. Deliveries of 747 jets were four compared with five in the year-ago period.Year to date, commercial deliveries were 554 airplanes compared with 563 in the year-ago period.Commercial Order & Backlog A look at Boeing’s third-quarter order details reveals that the company booked 127 net commercial orders (accounting for cancellations). This reflects a drop from the year-ago figure of 150.At the end of third quarter, the backlog of commercial airplanes touched 5,679. This clearly indicates the dominance and popularity of Boeing in commercial aerospace. The customers are willing to wait for years to get delivery for the high quality aeroplane Boeing offers.Defense DeliveriesIt is to be noted that in the defense and space business, Boeing’s deliveries totaled 44 in the third quarter compared with 50 in the year-ago quarter. Total deliveries consisted of 18 AH-64 Apache helicopters (both new and remanufactured) and 11 Chinook helicopters (new and renewed). In addition, the company delivered six F/A-18s, five P-8 models and four F-15s.Development in Defense SpaceWe expect that the new development in the defense space is likely to increase the defense orders for Boeing.The Senate has approved a $700 billion National Defense Authorization Act, which provides necessary funding to the U.S. Military to carry out activities in homeland and overseas. The bill authorizes $640 billion for national defense spending and $60 billion for Overseas Contingency Operations.The new bill authorizes $2.9 billion for procuring 17 KC - 46A tankers, which is $400 million and two tankers more than the administration’s request. It also authorizes $3 billion for Army helicopters, including nearly $1.8 billion for different variant of Chinooks Helicopters. Boeing is going to directly benefit from this development.Price MovementShare price of Boeing has increased 93.4% in the last 12 months, outperforming the Zacks Aerospace–Defense industry’s gain of 52.3%. This could be because the company’s strong balance sheet and cash flows provide financial flexibility in matters of incremental dividend, ongoing share repurchases and earnings accretive acquisitions.Our ViewBoeing anticipates that in next two decades, the world will need 41,030 new planes, worth $6.1 trillion. The company expects cost effective single-aisle jets to be the major driver behind demand growth, comprising 72% of the total projection. This translates into worldwide demand for 29,530 single-aisle jets, worth $3.2 trillion.We believe Boeing, with its high quality single-isle 737 model, is well placed to capture a large  share of the new orders of commercial jets.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderBoeing currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks in the same space include General Dynamics Corp. (GD  -  Free Report), Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC  -  Free Report) and Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1133,NOC,"Defense bellwether Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report) has secured a contract for the replacement of the AGM-86B air-launched cruise missile. Work related to this deal is scheduled to be over by 2022.Valued at $900 million, the contract was awarded by the Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center, Air Delivered Capabilities Directorate, Eglin Air Force Base, FL. Per the terms of the deal, Lockheed Martin will conduct technology maturation and risk reduction acquisition phase for the Long Range Standoff weapon (LRSO) — a next-generation cruise missile. Work will be carried out in Orlando, FL.Apart from Lockheed Martin, the U.S. Air Force has also awarded a similar contract worth $900 million to defense major Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report).A Brief Note on AGM-86BAerospace giant The Boeing Co.’s (BA  -  Free Report) AGM-86B air-launched cruise missile is long-range subsonic, 3,200-pound self-guided missile carried by a B-52 bomber at high and low altitudes. Armed with a nuclear warhead, it is a well-known American subsonic air-launched cruise missile (ALCM).The missile electronically “sees” the terrain over which it flies and can travel more than 1,500 miles to hit the target. Owing to its long range, the missile can be launched far from hostile territory and still reach its target.Our ViewThere has been a rapid rise in terrorist activities across the globe of late. With radical institutions having an easy access to weapons and North Korea consistently sending missile threats to the continental regions of the United States, America is left with little choice but to consistently develop its own tactical weaponries base.With this aim in view, for last few years the U.S. Air Force has been planning to introduce the LRSO to strengthen its strategic bomber fleet further. In July 2016, the Air Force released a request for proposals of development for its LRSO nuclear cruise missile program, with up to two contract awards expected in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.The proposal was to replace the aging AGM-86B air-launched cruise missile, with the weapon facing increasing sustainment and operational challenges against evolving threats. We believe the recently won contract by Lockheed Martin is in sync with this proposal.Notably, Lockheed Martin boasts decades’ experience in missile systems. Its varied defense product portfolio includes the Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile-Extended Range (JASSM-ER) —a long range, conventional air-to-ground, precision-guided standoff missile, along with tactical missiles and air-to-ground precision strike weapon systems.With the global missiles and missile defense system market projected to grow at a CAGR of 2.18% during 2017-2024, to reach a value of $41 billion, we can expect the company to win more such missile contracts in the days ahead. This in turn will surely boost Lockheed Martin’s growth trajectory in the aerospace and defense space.Price MovementLockheed Martin’s stock has returned 22% in the last one year, underperforming the 37.1% rally of the industry it belongs to. This could have been caused by the company’s F-35 program, which, despite being a prime project of the U.S. government, has been repeatedly criticised for being overtly expensive. Moreover, Lockheed Martin faces stiff competition from other defense majors like Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC  -  Free Report).Zacks RankLockheed Martin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1134,NOC,"Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report) announced that it has secured a $33.1 million contract from the U.S. Navy for Firepower Enhancement Program (FEP), System Technical Support.Details of the DealThe work related to the contract will be carried out at the company’s McKinney, TX facility. Additional funding related to the award will be obligated along with future delivery orders.The order has been awarded with an initial five-year ordering period ranging from Aug 20, 2017 to Aug 20, 2022. It also comes with one option consisting of a five-year ordering period from Aug 21, 2022 through Aug 20, 2027. The entire work order is expected to be completed by Aug, 2027.According to the Department of Defense, the development of FEP was aimed at implementing a second generation forward looking infrared that could detect and identify ranges under different battlefield conditions along with a far target location capability.Why Raytheon?Raytheon is one of the best-positioned large-cap defense players due to its non-platform-centric focus.  The company has been heavily investing in technological upgrades. In this context, Raytheon has been witnessing strong upside in its GaN–based naval radars. The company’s next-generation solutions include the air and missile defense radar (AMDR) and the enterprise air surveillance radar, which enable it to support the U.S. Navy and international customers with advanced capabilities to counter emerging threats.Defense ScenarioWith rising threats from North Korea along with expanding global terrorism, it has become extremely important for the United States to keep its defense weaponries updated.The proposed budget hike for fiscal 2018 by President Trump reflected a 10% increase over the current base budget level of the current year, hinting at the U.S. government to spend more on defense. Recently, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the 2018 defense policy bill, reflecting an expenditure level of $696 billion. It exceeded President Trump’s defense budget request proposed this March. If enacted, all these budgetary updates will immensely boost the business growth of all defense giants including Raytheon, Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report), Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report), The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) and many others.Price MovementIn the last six months, shares of Raytheon have gained 15.1% compared to the industry’s gain of 13.1% in the same period of time.Foreign military contracts continue to be the vital growth driver for Raytheon. Rising demand from the Gulf countries and Asia-Pacific will also boost revenues.Zacks RankRaytheon currently holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1135,NOC,"After the North Korea issue, geopolitical risks heightened again, with Trump's Afghanistan speech. President Donald Trump recently commented that as many as 4,000 more U.S. troops will be employed to handle Afghanistan’s terror issue and that he will launch a political arrangement with the Taliban. The President also said that a quick removal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan may once again attract terrorists to fill that gap.As per an article published on Bloomberg, the comments mark a shift from Trump’s presidential campaign. During the campaign, Trump only approved the necessity of U.S. interference in Afghanistan’s terrorism issue. In fact, he hinted at the more crucial need for abandoning military engagement in that region and deploying resources rather at the domestic land.At the start of the month, Donald Trump pledged that North Korean premier Kim Jong-Un’s nuclear threats will be met with “fire and fury.” Increasing tensions between the two regions — the U.S. and North Korea and recent comments about Afghanistan have pushed up defense and aerospace stocks (read: ETFs to Profit from US-North Korea Tensions).Moreover, the earnings season has also been quite impressive for companies in this sector. The sector came up with 90% of earnings and 70% revenues beat, which is pretty encouraging (read: Q2 Earnings Effect: 4 Must-See ETF Charts).ETF WinnerDefense Since stocks like Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) (up over 1.7%), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report) (up about 1.9%), General Dynamics Corporation (GD  -  Free Report) (up about 1.3%), Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report) (up about 1.4%) and Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report) (up about 1%) gained post Trump’s Afghanistan comments, aerospace and defense ETFs like iShares US Aerospace & Defense ETF (ITA  -  Free Report), PowerShares Aerospace & Defense Portfolio (PPA  -  Free Report) and SPDR S&P Aerospace & Defense ETF (XAR  -  Free Report) gained on August 22, 2017.ITA put about 11.1% weight in Boeing while the other above-mentioned stocks take about 27% of the fund. XAR invests about 16.3% of its weight in Boeing, Raytheon, Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman. About one-third of the PPA portfolio is invested in the above-mentioned stocks. As a result, on August 22, ITA, PPA and XAR were up about 1.2%, 1.1% and 1.3%, respectively. ITA and PPA added about 0.5% each after hours.ETF LoserPakistan Pakistan’s stock prices on the Karachi Stock Exchange dropped over 2% on Tuesday as Donald Trump issued warnings to Pakistan.

1136,NOC,"President Trump revealed a reversal of strategy in Afghanistan, promising to “fight to win” instead of withdrawing entirely. He vowed to ramp up U.S. engagement in Afghanistan, the country’s longest war to date. He added that moving troops away from Afghanistan would create a “vacuum”, which terrorists would “instantly fill”. But, he refrained from revealing specific troop numbers or measures of success.Defense stocks moved north on Trump’s Afghanistan speech, while such stocks have nearly doubled the S&P 500’s performance since his election victory. His commitment to swiftly increase military spending boded well for defense stocks. This calls for investing in such stocks for solid gains.Trump Announces More War in AfghanistanIn a much awaited speech, Trump announced that he won’t pull out troops from Afghanistan and is committed to a plan at winning the nation’s longest war, which is now in its 17th year. In other words, he is introducing a dramatic, new offensive in Afghanistan, which will integrate diplomatic, economic and military power. But, Trump refrained from divulging details on troop deployments or specific dates of operations for security reasons. He did acknowledge that his “original instinct was to pull out”, which was once an important campaign pledge before he became the President.Trump mentioned that the war will crush al Qaeda and prevent Taliban from taking over Afghanistan. He will urge NATO forces to join hands and support his new strategy. He also said that Pakistan is a terrorist hotbed and has harbored militants. Afghan Taliban and Haqqani network has found safe haven in Pakistan for the launch of multiple attacks on neighboring Afghanistan. He warned Islamabad of consequences if its government doesn’t take sweeping steps to eradicate such terrorist organizations. He stressed that Pakistan needs to have stronger ties with India in war against terrorists.Finally, he concluded that “terrorists take heed. America will never let up until you are dealt a lasting defeat. Under my administration, many billions of dollars more is being spent on our military. And this includes vast amounts being spent on our nuclear arsenal and missile defense. In every generation we have faced down evil, and we have always prevailed”.Big Money for Defense Contractors Tied to James MattisGeneral Dynamics Corporation (GD  -  Free Report) stands to gain handsomely from Trump’s Afghanistan “surge’’. And why so? Prior to joining the Trump administration, Defense Secretary James Mattis was an “independent director” of the multinational defense contracting behemoth. He was paid $594,369 by the company between 2013 and 2016.It was during that time, the company boasted of receiving a $216 million order from the U.S. Army to build a “Warfighter Information Network” system. It was immensely successful in serving the army in Afghanistan. The company also received multi-million dollar payments for providing soldiers in Afghanistan items like Foxhound vehicles to IT management services.And now with Mattis holding a far more operational role, it can be expected that General Dynamics will benefit more from the Afghan war. Mattis now looks into more lucrative Pentagon contracts, which are positioned to even get more lucrative in the light of Trump’s declaration to deploy more troops in Afghanistan.Defense Stocks Rise on Trump’s SpeechDefense stocks rose broadly following Trump’s remarks, with the iShares U.S. Aerospace and Defense ETF (ITA) rising 1.2% on Aug 22. Major defense stocks like Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report), Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT  -  Free Report) and Boeing Co (BA  -  Free Report) gained 1.9%, 0.9% and 1.7%, respectively. Northrop and Boeing were also awarded contracts for intercontinental ballistic missile system replacements.In fact, Trump’s pledge to significantly increase federal spending related to national security was cheered by Republicans and has helped defense and aerospace stocks scale higher. He had promised to seek a $54-billion hike in spending on tanks, ships and weapon systems. The defense budget will climb 10%, according to the White House, while Trump recommended $30 billion in supplementary military spending for this year (read more: 5 Stocks to Buy as Trump Promises to Spend Big on Defense).5 Best Defense Stocks to Buy NowAs Trump’s Afghanistan strategy gives defense stocks a boost, investing in the same seems a prudent choice.

1137,NOC,"Northrop Grumman Corp.’s (NOC  -  Free Report) unit, Aerospace Systems, has secured a contract for the Japan Global Hawk program.Valued at $130.5 million, the deal has been awarded by the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, OH.Per the agreement, Northrop Grumman will provide long lead material to commence the program for three global hawk block 30 (I) air vehicles, two ground control elements, improved integrated sensor suite, spares and a site survey.Scheduled to be completed by July 27, 2018, the work will be performed in San Diego, CA.The Global Hawk gained popularity mainly on its ability to transform itself into an operational weapons system as and when required. It was not only used by the Air Force for maintaining overseas surveillance after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, but has also been used extensively by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration for scientific research missions.Foreign military sales (FMS) provides the much needed respite at the time of negative defense budget revision and acts as a key performance catalyst for Northrop as well as other defense companies of United States. FMS are expected to contribute significantly to earnings given the solid prospects available in overseas.Development in Defense SpaceRising terror activities and current tension between the United States and North Korea have added to growth of the industry. In sync with this, theUnited Statesand its major allies has been strengthening their defense to combat the internal and external threats.On this note, the U.S. Senate recently passed fiscal 2018 defense policy bill worth $700 billion, which was proposed in July 2017. This bill provides about $640 billion for Pentagon’s main operations like buying weapons and paying the troops. The rest $60 billion for Overseas Contingency Operations will be utilized to fund the conflicts in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and elsewhere.Consequently, the current scenario in the defense industry is anticipated to further aid large companies like Northrop Grumman, The Boeing Co. (BA  -  Free Report) and Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT  -  Free Report).Our ViewNorthrop Grumman seems to benefit from a strong presence in Air Force, Space & Cyber Security programs.

1139,NOC,"Defense bellwether Lockheed Martin Corporation’s (LMT  -  Free Report) business segment, Space Systems, recently secured a contract for conducting the Airborne Launch Control System Replacement (ALCS-R) program. Work related to the deal is scheduled to be over by Oct 2, 2020.Details of the DealValued at $80.8 million, the contract was awarded by the Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center, Hill Air Force Base, UT. Per the deal, Lockheed Martin will conduct technology maturation and risk reduction for delivering a preliminary design and developing a fully functional prototype.  The company will utilize fiscal 2017 and 2018 research, development, test, and evaluation funds to complete the task at Littleton, CO.Moreover, through this agreement, ALCS-R aims to replace the legacy Airborne Launch Control System (ALCS) with an affordable system, to support the Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile weapon system. This replacement is expected to be complete by 2036. This in turn will offer a solution to meet the survivable launch platform — airborne fire control requirements for the ground based strategic deterrent weapon system through 2075. A Brief Note on Minuteman IIIThe Minuteman III is a strategic weapon system of the United States that uses a ballistic missile of intercontinental range. Through the state-of- -art improvements, the Minuteman system has evolved to meet new challenges. Modernization programs have expanded targeting options and improved accuracy and survivability of this system.Our ViewALCS help in conducting missile tests and deploying missiles successfully. During loss of command capability between the launch control center and remote missile launch facilities ALCS automatically assume command and control of the isolated missile or missiles.It is imperative to mention in this context that Lockheed Martin enjoys a legacy in developing operational intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) and has been continuously supporting the Air Force’s ICBM mission since the beginning, as the developer of the Atlas, Titan, MX Peacekeeper and Small ICBMs. Also the company is the leading provider of ground command and control systems for today’s Minuteman III.With increasing geopolitical tensions across the globe, it has become a necessary mandate for nations to stock up their arsenals to defend terrorist attacks. For the United States, the frequent missile tests conducted by North Korea have been sending a strong message of hostility toward America for past few months. As a result, the latter has been enthusiastically strengthening its missile stack in recent periods. The latest contract for ALCS-R reaffirms this fact.With Lockheed Martin being the largest defense contractor worldwide and given its combat-proven military equipments, we can expect more such contracts to usher in from Pentagon, which in turn will substantially boost its growth trajectory.Moreover, the recently approved fiscal 2018 defense policy bill worth $700 billion also buoys optimism for investing in major defense stocks. Therefore the time is ripe to add defense primes like Lockheed Martin, The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report) in your watchlist.Price MovementLockheed Martin’s stock has returned 32.2% over a year, underperforming the 50.8% rally of the industry it belongs to. This may have been caused by the company’s F-35 program, which despite being a prime project of the U.S. government has been repeatedly criticised for being overtly expensive. Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderLockheed Martin presently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). A better-ranked stock in the same space is General Dynamics Corporation (GD  -  Free Report), which holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.General Dynamics has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the past four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 3.67%.

1140,NOC,"Aerospace behemoth The Boeing Co. (BA  -  Free Report) secured a $349.2 million contract for Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD). Work related to the deal is scheduled to be over by Aug 20, 2020.Details of the DealThe contract was awarded by the Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center, Hill Air Force Base, UT. Per the terms of the agreement, Boeing will deliver an affordable total system replacement of Minuteman III missile to meet intercontinental ballistic missiles operational requirements. The replacement will be done by conducting technology maturation and reducing technical risk of this weapon system. Work will be carried out in Huntsville, Al, and various other locations. The company will utilize fiscal 2017 research, development, test and evaluation funds to finish the work.A Short Note on GBSD & MinutemanGround Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD) is the next generation intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) for the U.S. Air Force. Boeing’s Minuteman is one such ICBM, conceived in the late 1950s. With nine other industry contractors — including North American Aviation’s Autonetics Division, based in Anaheim, CA— Boeing has built, tested and deployed the Minuteman missiles.Minuteman missiles offer a quick-reacting, inertially guided, highly survivable component to America's strategic deterrent program. Through state-of-the-art improvements, the Minuteman system has been developed to meet new challenges and assume new missions. The latest version – Minuteman III – constitute part of the United States’ Strategic Command that includes the Navy’s Ohio class fleet of ballistic missile submarines and Air Force’s B-2 and B-52 bombers.What’s Favoring Boeing?There has been a rapid rise in terrorist activities across the globe of late. With radical institutions having an easy access to weapons and North Korea consistently sending missile threats to the continental regions of the United States, America is left with little choice but to consistently develop its own tactical weaponries base.Coming to Boeing, apart from enjoying a strong forte in the combat-proven aircraft space thanks to its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and backlog enabled the company to acquire substantial shares of the defense missile industry. Consequently, the company’s Defense, Space & Security segment witnessed healthy revenues and margins growth during the second quarter of 2017, along with an order booking worth $1 billion from the US Missile Defense Agency.Notably, the global missiles and missile defense system market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 2.18% during 2017-2024, to reach a value of $41 billion. Given this and the fact that majority of the top 10 weapon manufacturers hail from the U.S., Boeing is expected to win more such awards. This in turn will enable the aircraft major to gain significant traction in the aerospace and defense space, in the coming days.Price MovementShares of Boeing have rallied 78.7% over the last 12 months, outperforming the industry’s gain of 34.6%. This might be because of the company’s strong balance sheet and cash flows which have been providing financial flexibility in matters of incremental dividend, ongoing share repurchases and earnings accretive acquisitions. The company also poses strong competition to its peers like General Dynamics Corp. (GD  -  Free Report), Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC  -  Free Report) and Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report).Zacks RankBoeing currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1141,NOC,"Shares of several companies with ties to U.S. defense spending, including Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) and Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report), climbed on Tuesday, just one day after President Donald Trump announced a rededication of U.S. military forces in Afghanistan.President Trump announced that the U.S. would expand its role in Afghanistan during a roughly 30-minute speech on Monday. The president did not specify how many new troops would be deployed in the country or provide a timetable for the operation. However, White House military officials pointed to an increase of up to 4,000 additional U.S. troops.The new U.S. military forces in Afghanistan will be deployed for counterterrorism and military training purposes, which does not differ much from former president Barack Obama and his administration’s tactics in the region.Currently, 8,400 Americans are stationed in Afghanistan, along with roughly 4,000 North Atlantic Treaty Organization troops, based on most estimates. President Trump noted that the added forces are supposed to help fight against the Islamic State and other terrorist organizations such as the Taliban. Some of the troops will focus on training Afghan forces.On the back of the news, shares of Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report) and Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) both jumped by over 1.5% on Tuesday. Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report), Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report), and General Dynamics (GD  -  Free Report) all saw their stock prices gain between 1% and 1.4%.U.S. defense-based ETF prices also jumped after the announcement was made. Shares of the iShares US Aerospace & Defense ETF (ITA  -  Free Report), the PowerShares Aerospace & Defense ETF (PPA  -  Free Report), and the SPDR S&P Aerospace & Defense ETF (XAR  -  Free Report) all jumped around 1%.Yet, even with the addition of 4,000 new American troops in Afghanistan, the total numbers will pale in comparison to the more than 100,000 U.S. troops that were stationed in the country at its 2011-peak.President Trump said the U.S. wouldn’t write “a blank check” nor stay in Afghanistan indefinitely. But the president also came down on one of Afghanistan’s neighbors. “We can no longer be silent about Pakistan’s safe havens for terrorist organizations, the Taliban and other groups that pose a threat to the region and beyond,” President Trump said in his speech on Monday.The Pakistani stock exchange KSE 100 index fell by 0.40% on Tuesday, which marks a continued downward trend for the index in August.Additional Gains  On top of the potential gains from an increased U.S. military presence in Afghanistan, Lockheed Martin recently won a $427 million deal to work on America’s fleet of F-35 Aircrafts. Boeing and Northrop Grumman also won separate $320-plus million deals to begin to replace America’s aging arsenal of intercontinental ballistic missiles.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

1143,NOC,"Before we tick down the list of new Q3 earnings reports released before the opening bell this morning, another metric pointing to a strengthening economy: a positive read on September (preliminary) Durable Goods Orders. Results came out way ahead of expectations at +2.2%; analysts had been looking for +0.8%. Removing the more-volatile transportation goods totals, we still see +0.7%, which is again a healthy number. Ex-capital goods, non-Defense, ex-aircraft came in at +1.3%.These numbers indicate that factories look to be busier manufacturing hard products, which spells sunny days ahead for industrial and commercial companies, their workforces and their shareholders. Whatever doubt remains about a new Fed hike coming round the bend is even further quashed. The domestic economy is finally living up to its potential, after years of sluggish growth.Q3 Earnings BonanzaThe Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report), speaking of durable goods, topped expectations on both top and bottom lines this morning: $2.72 per share beat the $2.65 Zacks consensus estimate for the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company. Revenues reached $24.31 billion versus the $24.06 billion expected. The premier aircraft manufacturer also upped full-year guidance by a dime to $9.90 - 10.10 per share. Lower backlog quarter over quarter — an important metric for a company that makes such huge and expensive items — helped its Q3 results. Shares are up modestly at this hour; bear in mind BA stock has skyrocketed 70% since 2017 began.Fiscal Q4 2017 results from Visa (V  -  Free Report) also beat earnings and sales estimates, with 90 cents per share up 5 cents over the Zacks consensus and +15.4% from a year ago. Net operational revenues rose 14% year over year to $4.9 billion, higher than the $4.62 billion we were looking for. Visa continues its pristine earnings performance, having averaged an 8.4% positive surprise in its trailing four quarters. Visa shares are up another 1% in the early session, and are up nearly 40% year to date.Defense major Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report) posted a huge earnings beat: $3.68 per share was far ahead of the expected $2.92, whereas quarterly sales of $6.53 billion came in higher than the $6.32 billion anticipated. Northrop also cranked up its full-year earnings guidance notably — from $12.10 - 12.40 per share previously to $12.90 - 13.10 this morning. NOC shares are trading up nearly 2.5% in the current pre-market.Coca Cola (KO) also beat on top and bottom lines, albeit less impressively by comparison. Earnings of 50 cents per share topped estimates by a penny, whereas revenues for the quarter $9.1 billion from the expected $8.84 billion. Organic growth of 4% and improved results from its Sprite brand were the notable takeaways. Coke has now beaten earnings estimates 4 times in the last 5 quarters.Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA  -  Free Report) — the parent company of pharma retailer Walgreen’s — posted an impressive earnings beat of $1.31 per share, compared to the $1.22 expected, up 22.4% year over year. Sales of $30.15 billion outpaced the $30.05 in the Zacks estimate, up 5.3% year over year. Strong retail pharma sales in the U.S. was somewhat offset by weaker International sales.

1145,NOC,"Defense major Northrop Grumman Corporation’s (NOC  -  Free Report) business segment, Technical Services, recently won a contract for delivering nine engine overhauls to support the KC-10 program. Work related to the deal is expected to be finished by March 2018.Valued at $39.9 million, the contract was awarded by the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Tinker Air Force Base, OK. Work will be executed worldwide, including McGuire Air Force Base, NJ; Travis Air Force Base, CA and Tinker Air Force Base, OK. The company will utilize fiscal 2018 operations and maintenance funds to complete the task.KC-10 Program & NorthropNorthrop Grumman provides 24/7 global logistics support for the KC-10 Extender fleet of 59 aircraft. The fleet supports worldwide operations in dual capacity as a tanker and cargo transport. Northrop’s services include comprehensive supply chain management; engine management, overhaul and repair; aircraft depot maintenance and field teams; field service representatives and ground support equipment support, as well as engineering support services.On average, Northrop Grumman delivers 29 scheduled depot maintenance aircraft and 46 engines per year. Per management, Northrop’s improvements in engineering, depot and engine reliability and performance help the U.S. Air Force’s Air Mobility Command achieve a 49-month sustained 85% mission capable rate on average — the highest sustained rate for the KC-10 in more than 16 years.Our ViewNorthrop Grumman is one of the largest defense contractors in the country. Owing to its vast product portfolio, the company enjoys a strong presence in Air Force, Space & Cyber Security programs. Northrop Grumman also invests substantially in product innovation and has a strong focus on strengthening its ISR wing. This has helped the company in winning notable orders from both domestic and international sources.The latest contract reflects Northrop Grumman’s role in the maintenance of KC-10, the world’s largest tanker, for which the company provides advanced logistic support. Going forward, we expect the modernization initiatives at Technology Services segment, along with more contract wins expected, to substantially boost the business’ profitability.Moreover, the recently approved fiscal 2018 defense policy bill worth $700 billion also buoys optimism for investing in major defense stocks.

1146,NOC,"The Q3 earnings season is in full swing with 87 S&P 500 members having reported their quarterly results as of Oct 20. So far, the results reflect a positive and reassuring view of corporate earnings, which will most likely get strengthened as we move in the thick of the reporting cycle.Notably, 24.7% of the index’s total market cap have reported results. While annual earnings have improved 9.4%, revenues increased 7.3%. The beat ratio for the bottom line was 71.3%, while that for top line was 70.1%, as of Oct 20.Coming to the Aerospace-Defense industry, we saw Textron Inc. (TXT) kick-starting the Q3 earnings season last week with better-than-expected quarterly numbers. Several other majors in this space are slated to report third-quarter results this week.Notably, projections for the Aerospace sector (one of the 16 Zacks sector), which constitutes the Aerospace-Defense industry, hint at a mixed quarter, when compared to the overall Q3 forecast for the S&P 500 cohort. The sector’s earnings are likely to decline 12.9% on 5.3% higher revenues; while earnings for S&P 500 members are likely to rise 2.6% on 5% higher revenues. For more details on quarterly releases, you can go through our latest Earnings Preview.Interestingly, defense stocks in the third quarter reached new-all-time highs multiple times, courtesy of the varied supportive defense policy initiatives adopted by President Trump. In particular, the favorable budgetary amendments made by the U.S. government, like the passing of the fiscal 2018 defense policy bill worth $700 million, have boosted growth prospects of defense stocks. A steady flow of contracts from Pentagon to ‘rebuild’ the U.S. Army also provided an impetus to the stocks. With Trump strongly opposing the budget sequestration imposed by his predecessor, defense stocks are surely to gain notable traction in coming days.With more than 700 companies (180 S&P 500 members) slated to report their results this week, let’s find out where the following defense stocks stand before their release of quarterly numbers on Oct 25.The Boeing Company’s (BA  -  Free Report) solid deliveries of commercial aircraft are expected to primarily drive the company’s growth in the third quarter. Notably, its commercial deliveries showed a 7.4% annual improvement. Also a solid inflow of contracts for varied defense product offerings from both Pentagon as well as foreign allies will boost its quarterly sales.Evidently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s third-quarter sales growth is pegged at $24.06 billion, reflecting year-over-year increase of 0.7%.Moreover, thanks to the huge number of commercial orders that the company won, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has predicted higher operating numbers for the third quarter. Commercial Airplanes segment’s operating profit is now expected to be $1,756 million, up 10% year over year.Meanwhile, our proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Boeing this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, Boeing lacks the right combination. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Boeing presently carries a Zacks Rank #2.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s third quarter sales is $7.9 billion, reflecting 2.1% year-over-year growth.In particular, the company won a number of contracts in relation to its submarines. Being one of the top-notch submarine contractors in the nation, such contracts are expected to bolster the company’s Marine Systems segment’s growth. Evidently, our consensus estimate for the Marine Systems’ sales stands at $2,068 million, up 0.2% annually.However, Aerospace segment’s sales growth in the second half of the year might be dented owing to unfavorable margins improvement. Our consensus estimate for the segment is pegged at $2,039 million, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 9.2%.Moreover, our proven model does not conclusively shows that General Dynamics is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because the company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 and has an Earnings ESP of -0.01%.General Dynamics Corporation Price and EPS Surprise General Dynamics Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | General Dynamics Corporation QuoteNorthrop Grumman Corporation’s (NOC  -  Free Report) Aerospace Systems segment that fetch almost half of its sales, is a primary contributor to its quarterly growth.Notably, increased demand as well as deliveries of manned aircraft mainly boosts this segment’s sales. In the third quarter, the company won a number of contracts from the Pentagon. Impressively, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Aerospace Systems segment stands at $2,928 million, reflecting annual growth of 12.9%.Segment-wise, Mission Systems business unit has been benefiting from the cost-reduction initiatives. We expect the third-quarter results to reflect strong sales growth for this unit. Evidently, our consensus estimate for sales for Mission Systems unit is $1,156 million, reflecting annual growth of 1%.On the flip side, increased unallocated corporate expenses and effective tax rate dented the company’s second-quarter earnings growth. Anticipating similar expenses to linger, our consensus estimate for Northrop Grumman’s earnings of $2.92 per share reflects 3.2% annual decline.Moreover, our proven model does not conclusively shows that Northrop Grumman is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is becausethe company currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has an Earnings ESP of -1.93%. Its Most Accurate estimate is pegged at $2.87, lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.92 (read more: Will Aerospace Unit Drive Northrop's Q3 Earnings?).Northrop Grumman Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Northrop Grumman Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Northrop Grumman Corporation QuoteFLIR Systems, Inc.’s (FLIR  -  Free Report) diverse portfolio has been a major growth driver, helping it offset weaknesses associated with any one market. Key metrics like revenues, operating income, operating margin and adjusted EPS have benefited from its restructuring efforts that the company adopted to streamline business operations and optimize growth . We expect this trend to continue in the soon-to-be-reported quarter as well.In addition, impressive traction of FLIR Systems’ products, featuring the Lepton thermal microcamera core, is anticipated to boost the top line significantly. Also strategic acquisitions are likely to boost the company’s inorganic growth. Previously completed acquisitions, including Armasight, DVTEL and Dynamics, are expected to boost the company’s top-line performance.Our proven model shows that FLIR Systems is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because the company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 and has an Earnings ESP of +2.08%.

The company’s third-quarter results too is expected to be gain from the same.  Substantial inflow of orders from Pentagon for the company’s varied product offerings also remains a major catalyst.Let’s discuss the factors influencing Northrop Grumman’s quarterly results, in brief.Aerospace Segment ­– A Key CatalystAerospace Systems segment that fetch almost half of Northrop Grumman’s sales is a primary contributor of the company’s quarterly growth.Notably, increased demand as well as deliveries of manned aircraft mainly boosts this segment’s sales growth. In the third quarter, the company won a number of contracts from the Pentagon in this regard.Among them, the significant one is an Army contract worth $117 million for offering logistics support services for government-owned fixed wing fleet performing special electronic mission aircraft missions.Impressively, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Aerospace Systems segment stands at $2,928 million, reflecting annual growth of 12.9%.Northrop Grumman Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Northrop Grumman Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Northrop Grumman Corporation QuoteOrder Flows to Drive SalesDefense majors have been receiving a slew of contracts from Pentagon and foreign U.S. allies. Northrop Grumman too has been no exception in this regard. During the third quarter, the company’s notable contract wins include a contract worth $124.7 million to support the AN/APR-39 program, a $329 million Air Force contract for the Ground-based Strategic Deterrent and another order of $409 million for Next Generation Thermal, Power and Controls (NGT-PAC) program.Consequently Northrop Grumman is expected to gain from the number of contracts it has won in the third quarter. Evidently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s third-quarter sales is pegged at $6.3 billion, reflecting 2.6% year-over-year growth.Other Factors to ConsiderSegment-wise, Mission Systems business unit has been benefiting from the company’s successful cost-reduction initiatives. Considering this trend to continue in the second half of the year, Northrop Grumman has increased this unit’s annual sales expectation during second-quarter earnings call. Keeping this into consideration, we may expect the third-quarter results to reflect strong sales growth for this unit. Evidently, our consensus estimate called for sales of $1,156 million for Mission Systems, reflecting annual growth of 1%.On the flip side, increased unallocated corporate expenses and effective tax rate dented the company’s second-quarter earnings growth. Anticipating similar expenses to linger, our consensus estimate for Northrop Grumman’s earnings of $2.92 per share reflects 3.2% annual decline.Around the end of the third quarter, Northrop Grumman announced that it has agreed to acquire rocket-maker Orbital ATK  for $9.2 billion. Although no direct impact of this deal will get reflected in the upcoming results, further updates from the transaction can be expected once the company releases its third-quarter report.Earnings WhisperOur proven model does not conclusively shows that Northrop Grumman is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here, as we have mentioned below:Zacks ESP: Northrop Grumman has an Earnings ESP of -1.93%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at $2.87, lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.92. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Northrop Grumman currently carries a Zacks Rank #2, which along with a negative earnings ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Meanwhile, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are some defense companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc.

1148,NOC,"Textron Inc.’s (TXT  -  Free Report) sub segment, Marine & Land Systems, recently secured a contract to procure up to 255 mobile strike force vehicles. The deal will also offer related fielding hardware and field representative services for system de-processing.Valued at $332.9 million the contract has been awarded by the U.S. Army Contracting Command Warren, MI. Notably, work related to this agreement is anticipated to be completed by Oct 13, 2024.Why Textron?Textron Systems, under which Marine & Land Systems come, is known for its unmanned aircraft systems, advanced marine craft, armored vehicles, intelligent battlefield and surveillance systems, intelligence software solutions, precision smart weapons, piston engines, test and training systems as well as total life cycle sustainment and operational services.Furthermore, the company’s geographically diverse network of aircraft, defense & intelligence along with industrial and finance businesses helps to counter any specific business-related risk. Headquartered in Wilmington, MA, Textron is well known worldwide for its most recognizable and valuable brand names such as Bell Helicopter, Cessna Aircraft Company, Jacobsen, Kautex, E-Z-GO and Greenlee.In fact, Textron has a strong presence in diverse areas of business jets and other general aviation aircraft, helicopter, aircraft engines, golf carts, turf maintenance equipment, electronic test equipment and blow-molded fuel tanks as well.Recently, the company reported third-quarter results wherein its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.8% and also increased 6.6% from the year-ago quarter. However, revenues missed the same by 1.5% but improved 7.2% from the year-ago figure.With rising geopolitical tensions across the globe, Textron continues to witness increased demand for its combat-proven military aircraft and associated systems from the U.S. government as well as allied nations. More such contracts can be expected in near future, thanks to increasing global security threats, which in turn might significantly boost Textron’s revenue growth rate.Price MovementTextron has underperformed the broader industry in the last 12 months. The company’s current rate of return is 34.5% compared with the industry’s 52.7%.This lacklustre performance might have been led by the company’s aviation business, which continues to exhibit dismal performance on account of lower military and commercial turboprop volumes.Zacks RankTextron carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Better-ranked stocks in the aerospace and defense sector include Engility Holdings, Inc. (EGL  -  Free Report), Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) and Northrop Grumman Corp.

1149,NOC,"Defense prime Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) Aeronautics business division has clinched a contract regarding F-35 Joint Strike Fighter aircraft. Work related to this deal is scheduled to be over by December 2020.Details of the DealValued at $427.1 million, the contract was awarded by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD.  Per the terms of the agreement, Lockheed Martin will procure ancillary military equipment and pilot flight equipment for low rate initial production (LRIP) of the 11th Lot of F-35 jets. The services will be offered to the Air Force, Marine Corps, Navy, non-Department of Defense (DoD) participants and foreign military sales (FMS) customers.Majority of the work will be carried out in Inglewood, CA and White Plains, NY and the rest in St. Petersburg and Orlando, Fl and Fort Worth, TX. The order includes 36% of the work for the Air Force, 20% for the Marine Corps, 12% for the Navy, 19% for non-DoD participants and 13% for FMS customers.Fiscal 2015 aircraft procurement (Air Force and Navy), fiscal 2016 aircraft procurement (Air Force, Marine Corps and Navy), fiscal 2017 aircraft procurement (Air Force, Marine Corps and Navy), non-DoD participants and FMS funds will be utilized to complete the work.F-35 AttributesLockheed Martin’s F-35 Lightning II is a single-seat, single-engine 5th Generation fighter aircraft. It comes with an advanced stealth feature combined with enhanced fighter speed and agility, fully fused sensor information, network-enabled operations and advanced sustainment.Currently, three variants of F-35 are set to replace five fighter jets for the U.S. Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps as well as a variety of fighter jets for at least 10 other countries.With Lockheed Martin being the primary partner, the F-35 program has been supported by an international team of leading aerospace majors.Notably, Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC  -  Free Report) contributed its expertise in carrier aircraft and low-observable stealth technology to this program. Moreover, BAE Systems plc’s (BAESY  -  Free Report) short takeoff and vertical landing experience, and air systems sustainment supported the jet’s combat capabilities. Also, Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report), provided F-35s with the F135 propulsion system, which is the world's most powerful fighter engine.Our ViewWe remind investors that despite offering superior air security and stability, the F-35 program has been facing some engine-related technical issues for the last few years. Additionally, it has been repeatedly criticized by President Trump for being an overtly expensive project.In this context, Lockheed Martin finally inked an $8.5 billion deal with Pentagon this February. Per the agreement, the company will deliver 90 F-35s of the 10th Lot at a historically low rate either forced by Trump’s intervention or to maintain management’s earlier projection of cutting down cost by 6-7%.Going forward, the company is likely to adopt a cost-saving initiative to lower sustainment costs for F-35 by 10%, over the next few years. This, in turn, will result in cost savings of $1 billion over a five-year period. In fact, we believe the recent contract win will enable Lockheed Martin to take a step toward achieving its goal, so that it could provide more of these combat aircraft at an efficiently reduced rate.Meanwhile, Lockheed Martin is enjoying steady flow of contracts from the Pentagon since it has reduced its price. Earlier this month, the company won a modification contract, worth 5.6 billion, to offer LRIP of the 11th lot of F-35 Lightening II Joint Strike Fighter. Again, it won a modification contract, worth $258 million, to offer LRIP of the 10th lot of F-35 Lightening II Joint Strike Fighter.Interestingly, with the U.S. government expecting to spend approximately $400 billion in the upcoming decades to develop and purchase 2,443 F-35 jets, Lockheed Martin is trying its best to effectively reduce the price of this program. Additionally, the government might place larger orders. This, in turn, will boost the company’s profits in the near term.Price MovementShares of Lockheed Martin have rallied 18.8% in the last one year, underperforming the 33.3% rally of the industry it belongs to. This could be because the earlier budget cuts have put pressure on the top line while the present defense budget is more in favor of the sector.Zacks RankLockheed Martin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1150,NOC,"Defense prime Northrop Grumman Corporation’s (NOC  -  Free Report) business unit, Northrop Grumman Systems Corp., secured a contract for procuring 2103 signal processors, seven Large Aircraft Infrared Countermeasures (LAIRCM), Signal Processor Replacement (LSPR) assemblies and more than 1 million advanced threat warning (ATW) sensors. Work for the deal is scheduled to be over by Apr 2019.Details of the DealValued at $21.2 million, the contract was awarded by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD. Per the terms of agreement, the company will also supply seven smart connector assemblies for LSPR to support the LAIRCM program.Majority of the work will be carried out in Rolling, Meadows, IL and Goleta, CA; while the rest will be executed at various other locations within as well as outside the United States. The company will utilize fiscal 2017 aircraft procurement; research, development, test and evaluation; as well as other defense agency funds to complete the task.A Brief Note on LAIRCMThe LAIRCM system provides safety to onboard troops in a hostile situation. It is an active countermeasure that can automatically detect a missile launch. On identifying a missile, LAIRCM activates a high-intensity, laser-based countermeasure system to track and destroy the missile automatically. The primary purpose of the LAIRCM program is to protect large aircraft from man-portable missiles.Northrop Grumman’s LAIRCM system will be reinforced with new technologies to neutralize increasing threats and lower the overall handling costs for the U.S. Department of Defense.Our ViewOf late, terrorist groups have been increasingly using cheap yet deadly man-portable missiles. Thus, an effective anti-missile solution for the protection against such threats is the need of the hour. A well-equipped nation like the United States thus will always want to remain prepared for any sudden attacks.Moreover, over the past few months, repeated missile threats from North Korea have forced the United States to ramp up its focus toward its missile defense space. Undoubtedly, this has led the Trump administration to multiply its arsenal treasury, both in terms of attacking missiles as well as accumulating protective measures like LAIRCM.Currently, Northrop Grumman’s AN/AAQ-24(V) Directional Infrared Countermeasure (DIRCM) system is the only DIRCM system in production that protects an aircraft from infrared-guided missiles. LAIRCM is one variant of such a DIRCM. Considering the present situation in the nation and Northrop’s combat-proven LAIRCM, more contracts like the recent one can be expected to boost Northrop’s sales.Moreover, the latest Senate approval for the $700 billion National Defense Authorization Act indicates significant inflow of contracts for the front-row defense stocks in the United States. Therefore, the time is ripe for adding defense majors likeNorthrop, Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT  -  Free Report), Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report) and The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report), in your watchlist.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?

While majority of the work related to this contract will be carried out in Fort Worth, TX, the rest will be performed in multiple locations across the United States and the United Kingdom.F-35 AttributesLockheed Martin’s F-35 Lightning II is a single-seat and single-engine 5th Generation fighter aircraft, which comes with an advanced stealth feature combined with enhanced fighter speed and agility, fully fused sensor information, network-enabled operations and advanced sustainment.

1152,NOC,"Aircraft giant The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) won a five-year basic ordering contract worth $41.5 million for supplying spare parts for F/A-18 E/F aircraft. Work pertaining to the deal will be carried out in Missouri.The contract has been awarded by the Defense Logistics Agency Aviation, Philadelphia, PA. The company will utilize fiscal 2017 through 2021 Navy working capital funds to complete the task by Sep 30, 2021.A Brief Note on F/A-18Boeing’s F/A-18 Super Hornet — a twin-engine, supersonic, all weather multirole fighter jet — is the U.S. Navy’s primary strike and air superiority aircraft. It is capable of landing and taking off from an aircraft carrier. A single-seat variant of the Super Hornet, F/A 18E, is about 25% larger than its predecessor — the F/A-18C/D — but contains 42% lesser structural parts.Our ViewWith the meteoric rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) over the last few years and more developing nations increasing their share of defense spendings, the international market for defense equipment has been on an upward growth trajectory. This, in turn, has provided a solid impetus to sales in the Aerospace-Defense industry.Being one of the major players in the defense business, Boeing’s key forte has been combat-proven aircraft. Also, it has started developing military aerial refueling and strategic transport aircraft of late. Banking on its proven expertise in aerospace programs, Boeing has been winning contracts from the Pentagon for long. Last quarter, the company’s military aircraft business contributed $2.9 billion to its total revenues. Thanks to the recently won contract, we expect the company to witness similar solid revenue growth in this business, in the coming quarters.Moreover, last week’s Senate approval for the $700 billion National Defense Authorization Act indicates significant inflow of contracts for the front-row defense stocks in the United States. Therefore, the time is ripe for adding defense majors like Boeing, Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT  -  Free Report), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report) and General Dynamics Corporation (GD  -  Free Report), in your watchlist.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

1153,NOC,"Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report) announced that it has secured a $329 million contract from the U.S. Air Force, for the Ground-based Strategic Deterrent.Details of the ContractPer the contract, the company will work toward replacement of aging Minuteman III which will lower the associated technical risk in the missile to meet intercontinental ballistic missiles operational requirements. Northrop Grumman is expected to finish the work by Aug 20, 2020. All work related to this contract will be primarily carried out at the Redondo Beach, CA facility along with various other locations.Meanwhile, the Air Force has awarded a similar deal worth $349 million to The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) for Ground-based Strategic Deterrent.According to Reuters, Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT  -  Free Report) was another competitor who bid for the contract. However, Pentagon decided to go with the first two, for now.About Minuteman IIIBoeing’s Minuteman series of missiles are land-based intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) in service with the U.S. Air Force Global Strike Command. The first range of Minuteman missiles entered the service in the early 1960s and has evolved with time since its initiation. These weapon systems have been known to provide quick-reacting, inertially guided, highly survivable component to the country’s strategic deterrent program.The Need of the HourWith rising threats from North Korea along with expansion of global terrorism, it has become extremely important for the U.S. to keep its defense weaponries updated.The proposed budget hike for fiscal 2018 by President Trump reflected a 10% increase over the current base budget level of the current year, hinting at the U.S. government to spend more on defense. More recently, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the 2018 defense policy bill, reflecting an expenditure level of $696 billion. It exceeded President Trump’s defense budget request proposed this March. If enacted, all these budgetary updates will immensely boost the business growth of all defense giants including Northrop Grumman.Notably, Northrop Grumman has developed into one of the largest domestic defense contractor in terms of revenue, with a major platform-centric focus. The company has a strong presence in Air Force, Space & Cyber Security programs which have aided it in securing regular contracts from the different verticals of U.S. Defense. We believe the recently won deal is an example of that and will boost the company’s growth trajectory, going ahead.Price MovementShares of Northrop Grumman have returned 24.8% in the last one year compared to the industry’s increase of 34.6% in the same time period.This might have been led by the company’s escalating operating expenses, while steep competition from peers also remains a major concern.Zacks Rank and Other Stock to ConsiderNorthrop Grumman carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Another stock in the same space is Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report), also carrying a Zacks rank #2.

1154,NOC,"The Boeing Co. (BA  -  Free Report) has clinched a modification contract to support sustainment of C-17 aircraft due to increase in fleet and number operating bases.Details of the DealValued at $7.1 billion, the contract has been awarded by the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, C-17 Contracting Branch, Robins Air Force Base, GA.Work related to this deal is scheduled to be over by Sep 30, 2021 and will be carried out across the globe.A Brief Note on C-17Boeing’s C-17 Globemaster III is a large military transport aircraft. The multi-service C-17 can carry large equipment, supplies troops directly to small airfields in harsh terrain anywhere in the world.In addition, it can take off from a 7,600-ft. airfield, carry a payload of 160,000 pounds, fly 2,400 nautical miles, re-fuel in flight and land in 3,000 feet or less on a small unpaved or paved airfield in day or night. Also, it can perform tactical airlift, medical evacuation and airdrop missions.Why Boeing?Boeing is one of the major players in the defense business. In fact, the company stands out among its peers by virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and solid backlog.In particular, among other defense equipments, Boeing’s key forte has been combat-proven aircraft. Also, it started developing military aerial refueling and strategic transport aircraft, of late. In fact, with its proven expertise in aerospace programs, the company has been clinching a huge number of contracts from the Pentagon for long.For example, it recently clinched a contract worth $409 million, for Next Generation Thermal, Power and Controls (NGT-PAC) program. This deal forms part of a joint effort of multiple government agencies and industry to develop revolutionary and innovative technologies. Moreover, through it applied research will be conducted for enhancing knowledge and understanding of future power, thermal and controls requirements.Again, in June, Boeing secured a modification to a foreign military sales contract worth $410.9 million from the U.S. Army Contracting Command, Redstone Arsenal, AL. Per the terms of the original contract, it will provide 38 Apache aircraft, three Longbow crew trainers and associated spares to the U.K. government. Going forward, we expect such contracts, including the recent one, to add further impetus to the company’s growth trajectory.Moreover, Trump’s presidency seems to have created a win-win situation for the Aerospace and Defense big shots like Boeing, Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report) and Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report). Evidently, these stocks saw a notable rise after Trump presented his “America First” budget.Considering the current favorable budgetary scenario, we anticipate that such generous fund flows from Pentagon, in the form of contracts, will help Boeing to achieve its desired business expansion in the near term. Additionally, an increase in fund flow from the Pentagon has raised investor’s optimism in the stock.Price MovementShares of Boeing have rallied 76.4% in the last 12 months, outperforming the industry’s gain of 34.7%. This could be because of the company’s strong balance sheet and cash flows that provide financial flexibility in matters of incremental dividend, ongoing share repurchases and earnings accretive acquisitions.Zacks RankBoeing currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The deal has been awarded by U.S. Special Operations Command Contracting office, Tampa, FL.The $8 billion contract will enable Lockheed Martin to offer non-personal, global logistics support services along with the expertise to maintain program support. The deal will also help to maintain Enterprise management functions for the Program Executive Office of the Special Operations Forces Support Activity.Work related to this deal will be carried out in Bluegrass Station, Lexington, KY, Bluegrass Army Depot, Richmond, KY, Fort Walton Beach, FL, and Crestview, FL, as well as multiple customer locations both inside and outside the continental U.S. Fiscal 2017 operations and maintenance funds will be utilized to finance the proceeds of the contract.A Brief Note on SOF GLSSThe SOF GLSS deal is U.S. Special Operations Command's (USSOCOM) largest service contract vehicle providing a wide range of tailored logistics, maintenance and sustainment services. The Program Executive Office of the Special Operations Forces Support Activity (PEO SOFSA) oversees the contract and, under its direction, Lockheed Martin conducts its day-to-day operations, providing the full range of logistics services required to support the SOF community.Together, PEO SOFSA and Lockheed Martin provide one-stop service for agile, innovative, on-demand depot-like services to SOCOM components and other U.S. Government entities that support SOCOM’s missions worldwide.In 2016 the company submitted a bid for SOF GLSS contract, a competitive follow-on agreement to SOF CLSS and expected to receive an award decision on the same in mid-2017. The recently won deal seems to be in line with Lockheed Martin’s expectation.What’s Favoring Lockheed Martin?Lockheed Martin’s MFC business unit is well-known for offering air and missile defense systems along with fire control systems, mission operations support, readiness, engineering support and integration services. In the second quarter of 2017, the MFC business segment generated sales of $1.6 billion, which represented 12.6% of Lockheed Martin’s total sales.Going ahead, the company expects MFC’s net sales to increase in the mid-single digit percentage range in 2017 on a year-over-year basis. We believe the aforementioned contract will surely aid the company in achieving this target.  Moreover, being the Pentagon’s prime defense contractor, Lockheed Martin enjoys a lion’s share of the aerospace-defense space in the U.S. Also, $13.5 billion of the additional $25 billion budget proposal that came from President Trump for core Defense Department programs for the current fiscal, has been allocated for a number of top-rated defense equipments including those of Lockheed Martin’s.  This in turn, if accepted, will boost Lockheed Martin’s revenues growth.Price MovementShares of Lockheed Martin have rallied 14% in the last one year, underperforming the 31.2% rally of the industry it belongs to. This could have been caused by the company’s F-35 program, which, despite being a prime project of the U.S. government, has been repeatedly criticized for being overtly expensive. Moreover, Lockheed Martin faces stiff competition from other defense majors like The Boeing Co. (BA  -  Free Report), Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC  -  Free Report) and General Dynamics Corp. (GD  -  Free Report).Zacks RankLockheed Martin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1156,NOC,"Major defense stocks rallied on Aug 9, following a fresh altercation between the U.S. President Donald Trump and his North Korean counterpart Kim Jong-un. Notably, Trump warned North Korea that if the nation does not refrain from its repeated missiles threats, the U.S. will respond with “fire and fury.”In retaliation, Kim threatened to fire missiles on Guam, a U.S. territory in the Pacific that houses military bases. While rest of the broader market reacted negatively to the escalated geopolitical tensions, defense stocks picked up pace.However, it is imperative to mention that this cross-border tension between the U.S. and North Korea has not been the only driving force behind the defense stocks’ rally. The defense sector has been a big market winner for quite some time now, on the back of Trump’s presidential win and a few other factors.Factors Driving the U.S. Defense StocksInternational terrorist attacks as well as intra-national conflicts giving rise to varied civil wars have boosted the outlook for the U.S. aerospace and defense industry. Also, the ‘big’ spending promises made by Trump in his budgetary amendments provided an impetus to these stocks.To be specific, the Pentagon's fiscal 2018 (FY18) budget proposal made in March reflectsa total increase of $54 billion over the current level. Through this proposal, Trump not only repealed Obama’s defense sequestration but also made history by proposing the largest one-year increase in the Department of Defense’s funding.In the same month, Trump also proposed to increase the current fiscal’s defense budget by $30 billion. In July, the U.S. House passed the FY18 defense policy bill worth $696.5 billion that extensively surpassed Trump’s budget request.Further, rising defense spending by other major regional powers such as Japan and India have bolstered investors’ optimism in the industry. Also taking advantage of regional tensions prevailing in the Middle East, U.S. defense majors are expanding their foreign markets rapidly. The recently inked foreign military sales contracts include the arms deal worth $110 billion that Trump signed with Saudi Arabia in May. This deal came up with a potential value of $350 billion over 10 years, involving defense bellwethers like The Boeing Co. (BA  -  Free Report), Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report) and Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report).All these factors boosted the stocks of the broader Aerospace sector (a stand-alone sector) to rally 33.4% in the last year, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 index’s 12.8% gain.Earnings PictureThe Q2 earnings season is in its last leg and the picture so far appears to be quite encouraging. As of Aug 4, of the 90% defense stocks that have reported their quarterly figures in this space, 88.9% have topped earnings estimates, while 66.7% exceeded revenue estimates.Defense Stocks Soar to New All-Time HighsThis time, the fresh cross-border dispute between the U.S. and North Korea paid off well for defense behemoths – Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC  -  Free Report), Lockheed Martin and Raytheon – all of which hit new all-time highs on Wednesday, following Trump’s speech. Notably, these companies either manufacture high-end missiles or offer missile surveillance services that have been the main crux of this latest altercation. Banking on the below mentioned bullish trends boasted by these stocks, investing in them seem to be a prudent choice.Northrop Grumman provides systems, products and solutions to government and commercial customers in the areas of aerospace, mission systems and technology services worldwide. Its cyber solutions offer missile warning and defense systems. Northrop Grumman has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Both of Northrop’s earnings and revenue figures for the second quarter exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate.  Also, results were impressive on a year-over-year basis, thanks to strong sales growth at the Aerospace segment (read more: Northrop Grumman Tops on Q2 Earnings, Ups' 17 EPS View).

The company’s share returned 294% in last five years, compared to the broader industry’s return of 182.2%, therefore making it a viable investment choice.Lockheed Martin is the largest defense contractor in the world, which manufactures military aircraft, Joint Light Tactical vehicle, Littoral combat ships and many more alike defense equipments. Among its varied missile programs, notable ones are the Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) and Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD).

1157,NOC,"Defense major Northrop Grumman Corporation’s (NOC  -  Free Report) business unit, Systems Corp., recently clinched a modification contract for installing ZPY-8A/N radar in MQ-8C Fire Scout helicopter. Work related to this deal is expected to be over by May 2020.Details of the DealValued at $15.2 million, the contract was awarded by Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD. Per the terms of the deal, the company will install original equipment manufacturer (OEM) ZPY-8A/N radar in MQ-8C chopper. Alongside, Northrop will integrate the initial radar A-kit and provide additional non-recurring engineering in the aircraft.Majority of the work will be executed in Fort Worth, TX and Ozark, AL; while the remaining part will be carried out in San Diego and Santa Clarita, CA and Edinburgh, U.K. The company will utilize fiscal 2017 research, development, test and evaluation (Navy) funds to complete the task.A Brief Note on MQ-8CFire Scout is a combat proven, autonomous helicopter system designed by Northrop, which offers real-time Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance, and Target-acquisition (ISR&T), laser designation, and battle management to tactical users without relying on manned aircraft or space-based assets. There are two variants of Fire Scout, MQ-8C being one of them.MQ-8C Fire Scout is the Navy’s next generation autonomous helicopter. Its airframe is based on the commercial Bell 407, an advanced helicopter with more than 1,600 airframes produced by Textron Inc. (TXT  -  Free Report).The helicopter can take-off and land on any aviation-capable ship from both prepared and unprepared landing zones automaticatically. This helps to lower the reliance on man power. This enhancement increases the target range and endurance (more than double) and payload capacity (more than triple) of the helicopter.Our ViewBeing one of the largest aerospace and defense contractors in the United States, Northrop’s product line serves high-priority categories such as defense electronics, unmanned aircraft and missile defense satisfactorily. With more than 75 years of experience in advanced autonomy from the sea-floor to space, Northrop’s autonomous systems expand the boundaries of human potential to deliver end-to-end solutions that meet evolving mission requirements for a rapidly changing world. On top of that, its management is consistently innovating to ensure that the company’s autonomous platforms can meet the evolving mission requirements of its customers, both domestic and overseas.Meanwhile, rising terrorism and the recent spate in political hostility between the United States and North Korea have provided a solid boost to the aerospace and defense industry. Concurrently, the United States and its major allies’ move to strengthen their arsenals to combat the internal and external threats provided a substantial impetus to the stocks.On this note, the U.S. Senate recently passed fiscal 2018 defense policy bill worth $700 billion which provides about $640 billion fund for Pentagon’s main operations like buying weapons and paying the troops.Consequently, the current scenario in this industry is anticipated to boost defense majors like Northrop, The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) and Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT  -  Free Report), as is evident from increasing number of contracts being awarded by the Pentagon in recent months. We believe the latest contract is an instance of the same and expect the company to win more such deals, in days ahead.Price MovementSince Northrop’s announcement of Orbital ATK  acquisition, shares of the company have rallied 5.8% compared with the industry’s gain of 3.1%. This shows that the news of the acquisition has received positive response from the market.Zacks RankNorthrop presently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1158,NOC,"Lockheed Martin Corp.'s (LMT  -  Free Report) Aeronautics business division has won a modification contract to support the first of class flying trials for F-35B aircraft and release military permit to fly the same from Queen Elizabeth class aircraft carrier. Notably, these jets will be used by the U.K. government.Contract DetailsValued at $11.6 million, the contract has been awarded by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD.The work is scheduled to be completed by March 2018 and will use international partner funds. While majority of the work related to this contract will be carried out in Fort Worth, TX, the rest will be performed in multiple locations across the United States.F-35 AttributesLockheed Martin’s F-35 Lightning II is a single-seat and single-engine 5th Generation fighter aircraft. It comes with an advanced stealth feature combined with enhanced fighter speed and agility, fully fused sensor information, network-enabled operations and advanced sustainment.Markedly, the F-35B short takeoff/vertical landing (STOVL) variant is the world’s first supersonic STOVL stealth aircraft. It is designed to operate from a range of air-capable ships near front-line combat zones. Also, it can take off and land conventionally from longer runways on major bases.Also, the F-35 program has been supported by an international team of leading aerospace majors with Lockheed Martin being the primary partner. While, Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC  -  Free Report) contributed its expertise in carrier aircraft and low-observable stealth technology to this program, BAE Systems plc’s (BAESY  -  Free Report) short takeoff and vertical landing experience as along with air systems sustainment supported the jet’s combat capabilities. Also, Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report), provided F-35s with the F135 propulsion system, which is the world's most powerful fighter engine.Our ViewWe remind investors that despite offering superior air security and stability, the F-35 program has been facing some engine-related technical issues for the last few years. Additionally, it has been repeatedly criticized by President Trump on being an overtly expensive project.Finally, Lockheed Martin inked a deal worth $8.5 billion with Pentagon this February with the intent of delivering 90 F-35s of the 10th Lot at a historically low rate either forced by Trump’s intervention or to keep management’s earlier promise to cut down cost by 6–7%.Going forward, Lockheed Martin's management is likely to adopt a cost-saving initiative to lower sustainment costs for F-35 by 10%, over the next couple of years. This, in turn, is anticipated to result in cost savings of $1 billion over a five-year period.Moreover, we believe that the recent contract win will enable the company to take a step toward achieving its goal and allow it to provide more of these combat aircraft at an efficiently reduced rate.Meanwhile, Lockheed Martin seems to enjoy steady flow of contracts from the Pentagon since reduction of its F-35 price. In July, it won a modification contract, worth $5.6 billion, to offer low-rate initial production of the 11th lot of F-35 Lightening II Joint Strike Fighter.In the upcoming decades, with the U.S. government expecting to spend approximately $400 billion for the development and purchase of 2,443 F-35 jets, Lockheed Martin is trying its best to effectively reduce the price of this program. Also, the government is likely to place larger orders and boost the company’s profits in the near term.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

1160,NOC,"Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) business unit, Aeronautics, has won a contract to offer supplies and services for the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter.Contract DetailsThe contract, which is valued at $53.5 million, has been awarded by Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD.Per the deal, Lockheed Martin will provide milestone event capabilities, including retrofit modification kits and installation services for the Marine Corps, Air Force, Navy as well as non-Department of Defense (DoD) participants.The modification includes 50% of the work for the Marine Corps, 21% for the Air Force, 18% for the Navy and 11% for non-DoD participants.Work is scheduled to be completed by July 2021 and September 2025 for DoD customers and non-DoD participants, respectively. It will be performed in Fort Worth, TX, and will use fiscal 2016 aircraft procurement (Marine Corps and Air Force), fiscal 2017 aircraft procurement (Navy) and non-DoD participants’ funds.F-35 AttributesLockheed Martin’s F-35 Lightning II is a single-seat, single-engine 5th Generation fighter aircraft. It comes with an advanced stealth feature combined with enhanced fighter speed and agility, fully fused sensor information, network-enabled operations and advanced sustainment.Currently, three variants of F-35 are set to replace five fighter jets for the U.S. Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps as well as a variety of fighter jets for at least 10 other countries.With Lockheed Martin being the primary partner, the F-35 program has been supported by an international team of leading aerospace majors.Notably, Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC  -  Free Report) contributed its expertise in carrier aircraft and low-observable stealth technology to this program. Moreover, BAE Systems plc’s (BAESY  -  Free Report) short takeoff and vertical landing experience, and air systems sustainment supported the jet’s combat capabilities.

This, in turn, will result in cost savings of $1 billion over a five-year period. In fact, we believe the recent contract win will enable Lockheed Martin to take a step toward achieving its goal, so that it could provide more of these combat aircraft at an efficiently reduced rate.Meanwhile, Lockheed Martin is enjoying steady flow of contracts from the Pentagon since it has reduced its price. In August, the company won a modification contract, worth 5.6 billion, to offer low-rate initial production (LRIP) of the 11th lot of F-35 Lightening II Joint Strike Fighter. Again, it won a modification contract, worth $258 million, to offer LRIP of the 10th lot of F-35 Lightening II Joint Strike Fighter.Interestingly, with the U.S. government expecting to spend approximately $400 billion in the upcoming decades to develop and purchase 2,443 F-35 jets, Lockheed Martin is trying its best to effectively reduce the price of this program. Additionally, the government might place larger orders. This, in turn, will boost the company’s profits in the near term.Price MovementLockheed Martin’s stock was up 17.7% in the last one year, underperforming the broader industry’s gain of 33.1%. This could be because the earlier budget cuts have put pressure on the top line while the present defense budget is more in favor of the sector. Furthermore, we believe that budget deficits and political uncertainty might make future defense budgets vulnerable to cutbacks.Zacks RankLockheed Martin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1161,NOC,"Pentagon’s largest defense contractor, Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report), has clinched a modification contract to incorporate an unpriced change order for acceleration and stabilization/restoration of supply rate for F-22 sustainment.Details of the DealValued at $70 million, the contract has been awarded by the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Hill Air Force Base, UT.Lockheed Martin will utilize fiscal 2017 operations and maintenance funds to complete the work by Dec 31, 2019. Work related to the modification deal will be carried out in Fort Worth, TX.A Brief Note on F-22Lockheed Martin’s F-22 Raptor is the fifth-generation, single-seat, twin-engine, all-weather stealth tactical fighter aircraft with a unique combination of stealth, speed, agility and situational awareness along with lethal long-range air-to-air and air-to-ground weaponry.However, high development costs, ban on exports and development of the more versatile F-35 aircraft led to the discontinuation of F-22 production.What's Favoring Lockheed Martin?Of late, there has been a rapid increase in terrorist activities across the globe. With radical institutions having an easy access to weapons and North Korea consistently sending missile threats to the continental regions of the United States, America is left with little choice but to consistently develop its own tactical weaponries base.Markedly, being the Pentagon’s prime defense contractor, Lockheed Martin enjoys a lion’s share of the aerospace-defense industry in the United States. Also, the recent budgetary amendments in the country have favoured defense giants like Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics Corp (GD  -  Free Report), Northrop Grumman Corp.

1162,NOC,"Defense bellwether Lockheed Martin Corporation’s (LMT  -  Free Report) business segment, Rotary and Mission Systems (‘’RMS’’), secured a modification contract for offering equipment upgrades and spares to the AEGIS Weapon System baseline located in Japan. Work related to the deal is scheduled to be over by September 2020.Details of the DealValued at $49.3 million, the contract was awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C. Per the terms of the agreement, Lockheed Martin will also supply systems engineering and staging services support, in relation to the AEGIS baseline, to the Japanese Computer Program Test Site.Majority of work for this foreign military sales (FMS) deal will be carried out in Moorestown, NJ. The remaining work will be carried out in Yokosuka, Japan and Clearwater, FL.A Brief Note on AegisAEGIS is an integrated missile-guidance system. With Lockheed Martin as its primary manufacturer, the AEGIS Weapons system is used by the U.S. Navy and allied ships.Over time, AEGIS has become an integral part of the U.S. Navy by developing sophisticated capabilities to counter emerging threats and leverage new technologies. Its latest configuration, Baseline 9, offers an open architecture framework to allow extreme flexibility.Our ViewLockheed Martin's RMS segment carries out some of the company's high-profile programs, including the Aegis Combat System, Littoral Combat Ship, MH-60 helicopter avionics, along with military and commercial orders. It generated revenues of $3.4 billion in the second quarter of 2017, reflecting 3% year-over-year growth.In light of the recently won FMS contract, we expect this segment to witness similar or even more revenue growth in coming quarters.Currently, Lockheed Martin's AEGIS is the maritime weapon system of choice for six powerful nations. As of January 2017, 84 U.S. Navy ships were in service with the AEGIS Weapons System installed. This number will definitely rise given the strong demand for AEGIS prevalent across the globe. Considering these developments, we expect Lockheed Martin to win more contracts like the latest one, in days ahead, which, in turn, will boost its profitability.Moreover, the latest Senate approval for the $700 billion National Defense Authorization Act indicates significant inflow of contracts for the front-row defense stocks in the United States. Therefore, the time is ripe for adding defense majors like Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report) and The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report), in your watchlist.We are reissuing this article to correct a mistake.

1163,NOC,"General Dynamics Corp.’s (GD  -  Free Report) subsidiary, Electric Boat Corp., has clinched a $341.2 million modification contract to exercise the option for design agent, planning yard, engineering and technical support for in-service nuclear submarines. Notably, the deal has been awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C.About the ContractElectric Boat will provide drawings and associated technical data, design change documentation, logistics technical data, configuration management as well assubmarine safety design review.The contractor will also offer hull, mechanical and electrical engineering, non-propulsion plant electrical system engineering, propulsion plant engineering, besides maintenance engineering.In addition, this subsidiary will give refit/availability technical support, on-site support, configuration change program design and installation support, configuration change program material support and submarine technical trade support.These apart, the company will also support training and facility, research, development, test and evaluation program, research and development of submarine/submersibles, miscellaneous special studies, temporary alteration support, modernization of submarine/submersible systems/subsystems and affordability/cost reduction technical support. Markedly, the dealincludes foreign military sales (FMS) to Spain.While majority of the work will be performed at Groton, CT, the rest will be performed at a few other places across the United States. It will be completed using FMS and fiscal 2017 shipbuilding and conversion (Navy) as well as fiscal 2017 other procurement (Navy) fundsby September 2018.Nuclear Submarines and the United StatesTo counter the rising geopolitical tensions across the world, the U.S. government has been designing submarines for decades. In 1954, the U.S. Navy was the first to launch a nuclear-powered submarine. These submarines were markedly better than the diesel-engine ones that had to make multiple stops for refueling. Currently, the U.S. Navy has three classes of nuclear-powered attack submarines — Virginia-class, Ohio-class and Los Angeles-class.Notably, the market for nuclear submarine is a consolidated one in the United States, operated by two prime players like General Dynamics and Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report). As a result, both the companies enjoy a large share of the market and high profit margins.In this context, it is imperative to mention that recently the U.S. administration has been allotting significant provision for nuclear submarines in the nation’s defense budget, thereby encouraging submarine-manufacturers in boosting their production. Evidently, the fiscal 2017 budget proposal allocated $8.1 billion for submarines.Our ViewGeneral Dynamics enjoys a dominant position as a Navy contractor. This is because it is one of the only two contractors in the world equipped to build nuclear-powered submarines. The company is also a prime contractor for the development of Columbia-class submarines and Virginia-class submarines.Given the Navy’s recent acknowledgement of the nuclear submarines as its top priority and the huge budget allotted to the same, the modification contract will undoubtedly render the company a leading position in the nuclear-powered submarine industry.Recently, the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee approved fiscal 2018 defense policy bill. The National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal 2018, worth $700 billion, includes $25 billion to boost Navy shipbuilding. Going forward, the bill is anticipated to boost revenue growth for General Dynamics, which is one of the prime shipbuilders in the United States.Price MovementShares of General Dynamics have surged 31.9% in a year, underperforming the industry’s gain of 43.7%. This downturn might have been caused by the earlier budget cuts inflicted by the U.S. government in the defense space.Zacks RankGeneral Dynamics carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1164,NOC,"Shares of companies with ties to U.S. defense spending, including Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report) and Boeing (BA  -  Free Report), fell on Monday despite newly intensified rhetoric from North Korea regarding the possibility of war with the U.S.North Korea Tensions North Korea’s foreign minister Ri Yong Ho said on Monday that the U.S. had declared war on his country, according to a Wall Street Journal report. The foreign minister’s claim was reportedly in response to a Saturday flyover of U.S. bombers and fighter jets near North Korea—north of the Demilitarized Zone—and a tweet from President Donald Trump.But the U.S. has a different view of those flights, and President Trump took to Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report) Saturday to rebuke the North Korean foreign minister’s statements to the U.N. over the weekend.“This mission is a demonstration of U.S. resolve and a clear message that the president has many military options to defeat any threat,"" Defense Department spokesman Dana White said in a statement over the weekend. “North Korea's weapons program is a grave threat to the Asia-Pacific region and the entire international community.”Just heard Foreign Minister of North Korea speak at U.N. If he echoes thoughts of Little Rocket Man, they won't be around much longer!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2017The North Korea minister told reporters on Monday that North Korea had “every right to make countermeasures, including the right to shoot down U.S. strategic bombers, even if they are not yet inside the air-space border of our country.” The official said that every possible option for a North Korean response is on the table.Ri Yong Ho also said if North Korea takes action against U.S. military planes that “the question of who will be around much longer will be answered then.”U.S. officials were quick to respond and try to curb the further escalation of tensions. “We continue to seek a peaceful denuclearization of the Korean peninsula,” State Department spokesman Justin Higgins said. ""No nation has the right to fire on other nations’ aircraft or ships in international airspace or waters.”White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders also responded and said that claims that the U.S. declared war against Kim Jong Un’s regime were “absurd.”Defense StocksDespite the revved up and continued war of words between Washington and Pyongyang, shares of some of the biggest U.S. aerospace and defense companies fell.Lockheed Martin stock dipped 0.41% while Boeing saw its stock price fall 0.85%. Shares of Raytheon (RTN  -  Free Report) fell 0.54%, while General Dynamics (GD  -  Free Report) and Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report) stock experienced more marginal declines.  Defense ETFs,including the PowerShares Aerospace & Defense ETF (PPA  -  Free Report), the SPDR S&P Aerospace & Defense ETF (XAR  -  Free Report), and the iShares US Aerospace & Defense ETF (ITA  -  Free Report) all fell by about 0.50%.Aside from defense stock dips, the iShares MSCI South Korea Index Fund ETF (EWY  -  Free Report), which tracks South Korean companies, fell by 0.65%.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

1165,NOC,"Military shipbuilder Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc.’s (HII  -  Free Report) business unit, Newport News, recently secured a modification contract for performing dry-docking operations of USS Helena (SSN 725). Work related to this deal will be executed at the company’s shipbuilding yard in Newport New, VA.Valued at $65.1 million, the contract was awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C. Per the terms of the deal, the company will conduct repairing, maintenance, upgrades and modernization of USS Helena. Huntington Ingalls will utilize fiscal 2018 operations and maintenance (Navy) funds to complete the task by April 2018.A Brief Note on USS HelenaUSS Helena (SSN 725) is a Los Angeles-class nuclear-powered fast attack submarine. Notably, the Los Angeles-class forms the backbone of the U.S. Navy's submarine force.Nuclear Submarines & the United StatesTo counter the rising geopolitical tensions across the world, the U.S. government has been designing submarines for decades. Notably, the modern-day nuclear-powered submarines are markedly better than the diesel-engine ones that had to make multiple stops for refueling.In the United States, the market for nuclear submarine is a consolidated one, operated by two prime players — Huntington Ingalls and General Dynamics Corporation (GD  -  Free Report).

Evidently, the fiscal 2017 budget proposal allocated $8.1 billion for submarines.How Will the Deal Benefit Huntington?Huntington’s Newport News division enjoys one of the leading positions in the designing and building nuclear-powered submarines for the U.S. Navy. As of December 2016, Newport News delivered 59 submarines to the U.S. Navy which comprised 45 fast attack and 14 ballistic missile submarines. Moreover, of the 52 nuclear-powered fast attack submarines currently in active service, 25 were delivered by Newport News.The global submarine market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5% to reach a value of $27.6 billion from 2016 to 2021, as forecasted by Technavio market research analysts. Considering this and the aforementioned developments, we can expect Huntington Ingalls to win more such submarine-related contracts going ahead, thereby boosting its profit margin.Price PerformanceShares of Huntington have rallied 47.1% over a year, outperforming the industry’s 46.9% gain. The company is the sole designer and manufacturer of nuclear powered aircraft carriers in the U.S. Over 70% of the active U.S. Navy fleet consists of Huntington Ingalls ships and the company continues to enjoy strong order growth from the U.S. Navy. This in turn may have led to the company’s aforementioned outperformance.  Zacks Rank and Other Stocks to ConsiderHuntington Ingalls currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).A few other top-ranked stocks in the aerospace-defense space are The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report), both of which carry a Zacks Rank #2.

1166,NOC,"Northrop Grumman Corp.’s (NOC  -  Free Report) unit, Systems Corp., has secured a modification contract for low-rate initial production of the Spider Increment IA remote control unit. Valued at $13.4 million, the deal has been awarded by the U.S. Army Contracting Command, NJ.Scheduled to be completed by Feb 13, 2019, the work will be performed in Madison, AL and Melbourne, FL. The fiscal 2016 and 2017 other procurement (Army) funds will be used to complete the task.A Brief Note on Spider Increment IASpider Increment 1 is a hand-emplaced, remotely controlled, man-in-the-Loop, anti-personnel munition system that is presently being fielded.Meanwhile, Spider Increment IA is being developed as an ensuing incremental development to the baseline Spider Program.

It will also be capable of seamlessly communicating the munition field status and location to the Mission Command based on the availability of an unclassified network.Spider Increment IA is a Special Interest Program with Office of the Secretary of Defense oversight (operational testing only).Development in Defense SpaceRising terror activities and current tension between the United States and North Korea have resulted into growth of the industry. In sync with this, the United States and its major allies have been strengthening their defense to combat the internal and external threats.On this note, the U.S. Senate recently passed fiscal 2018 defense policy bill worth $700 billion that was proposed in July 2017. This bill provides about $640 billion fund for Pentagon’s main operations like buying weapons and paying the troops. The rest $60 billion for Overseas Contingency Operations will be utilized to fund the conflicts in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and elsewhere.Consequently, the current scenario in the defense industry is anticipated to further aid large companies like Northrop Grumman, The Boeing Co.

1167,NOC,"We issued an updated research report on Textron, Inc. (TXT  -  Free Report) on Oct 12. The company is a global multi-industry company that manufactures aircraft, automotive engine components and industrial tools.Textron follows a systematic inorganic growth strategy and thus remains focused on acquisitions. In line with this strategy, during the first quarter, Textron closed the acquisition of Arctic Cat, a leader in the recreational vehicle industry, for $247 million. This acquisition has expanded Textron’s presence in the power-sports segment as well as utility vehicle market, courtesy of Arctic Cat’s established dealer network. Management expects Arctic Cat to contribute $400-$500 million of sales for the company in 2017.The company also remains focused on innovation to expand its existing operations. To this end, Textron began delivering its new ELiTE series lithium golf cars in the second quarter. Notably, the ELiTE offers high efficiency with zero battery maintenance, apart from demonstrating Textron’s industry-leading product innovation.Moreover, Textron is forging ahead with the development of its 505 Jet Ranger X programs. We expect, new product offerings will heighten competition and ensure fresh orders for the conglomerate.On the flip side, Textron’s Aviation business continues to exhibit dismal performance on account of lower military and commercial turboprop volumes. Dearth of international order for the King Air turboprops was the primary reason for its weak performance. As a result, despite strong long-term fundamentals, we remain skeptical about the intermediate prospects of Textron’s commercial aerospace businesses.Moreover, the company faces tough competition from its peers like The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report) and General Dynamics Corporation (GD  -  Free Report). This may have caused the company to underperform its industry over a year.Evidently, Textron's share price gained 41.7% in the last one year, underperforming the industry's rally of 47.7% Zacks RankTextron currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1168,NOC,"Defense stocks have been rising with escalation of tensions between the US and North Korea, while the broader stock rally has stalled. Raytheon (RTN  -  Free Report), Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report) and Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report) hit record highs after President warned North Korea against making any more threats to the US.Trump said North Korea faces ‘fire and fury like the world has never seen before” and the rogue nation responded by threatening to launch a missile strike on Guam.The sentiment for Aerospace & Defense stocks improves with rising geopolitical tensions. They surged after US missile strikes on Syria.  And, that is one of main reasons why these stocks performed well in the last few years, despite defense budget cuts in the US and Europe.Many developing countries including India, UAE, Saudi Arabia and Brazil have increased their defense spending over the past few years. Of late, Japan and South Korea have also boosted their defense spending in response to increased military spending by China. Trump’s budget proposals call for a boost in US defense spending, which would be positive for these stocks.Most aerospace & defense companies reported excellent earnings for Q2 and have seen continued positive momentum in earnings estimates. Aerospace & Defense ETFs have significantly outperformed the broader market this year.To learn more about top ranked Aerospace & Defense ETFs--the iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF (ITA  -  Free Report), the SPDR S&P Aerospace & Defense ETF (XAR  -  Free Report) and thePowerShares Aerospace & Defense Portfolio (PPA  -  Free Report), please watch the short video above.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?                                                                             Here's another stock idea to consider.

The company already had a strong presence in these areas and expects to build up from its current position and maintain dominance in these areas.Initiatives to Reach TargetFor expansion of its business in Fabrication area, Spirit AeroSystems has developed centers of excellence in Wichita for five-axis complex parts, established a three and four-axis center of excellence at its facility in McAlester, OK. Also, it is expanding its Malaysia site where it does complex assemblies. The company aims to achieve its five-year target by expanding business with its current commercial and military customers and supplying materials to new customers.The company supplies more than 38,000 unique parts to support its commercial and defense customers and is investing in R&D activities to provide better quality product.We believe the approval of higher-than-expected defense expenditure for fiscal 2018 will boost the prospect of Spirit AeroSystems’ defense orders. The $700 billion defense expenditure for fiscal 2018 will definitely boost orders and benefit secondary defense product suppliers like Spirit AeroSystems.The company is presently assisting Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT  -  Free Report), The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report) in various important programs.  With the existing defense customers and the prospective new ones, the company is well poised to achieve its defense order target.Backlog RisesThanks to its quality product offering, the company has registered an influx of fresh orders, resulting in a substantial increase in its backlog. Backlog at the end of second-quarter 2017 was $46 billion compared with $29 billion at the end of 2016.The orders received from Boeing and Airbus in the first half of 2017, are the primary reasons for the rise in backlog of the company.Zacks RankSpirit AeroSystems currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1170,NOC,"The U.S. aerospace and defense industry has been on a growth trajectory since the beginning of the year, courtesy of  a number of favorable factors both domestic as well as international. Also, Trump’s latest moves and policies have been helping the stocks to recover from the losses incurred due to the budget sequestration imposed by the previous administration.Coming to the third quarter’s performance, the industry ended the period on a positive note racking up a market-thumping return. Evidently, the Zacks Aerospace-Defense industry gained 16.8% in the September quarter, higher than the S&P 500’s return of 3.8%.To understand what led the defense stocks to outperform the broader market, we have briefly mentioned below the factors that boosted the industry in the past three months.  Budget UpsideOf late, geo-political tensions and terrorist activities are on the rise globally. These incidents have been driving the demand of defense products, in turn providing a substantial impetus to the stocks. Also, the recent U.S. budgetary amendments have been driving the stocks.To this end, the recently approved defense bill policy worth $700 billion is worth mentioning. In particular, on Jul 14, 2017, the U.S. House passed the FY18 defense policy bill worth $696.5 billion that surpassed Trump’s March budget request worth $610 billion.Finally, in late September, the Senate approved a $700 billion National Defense Authorization Act, which included a funding provision of $640 billion for national defense spending and $60 billion for Overseas Contingency Operations. It goes without saying that the funding significantly boosted the growth prospects of defense stocks.Trump’s Take on International IssuesThe global market, during the third quarter, witnessed continued cross-border tension between North Korea and the United States as the former conducted repeated missile tests targeting the United States and its allies.ratioThese rapid altercations boded well for the U.S. defense bellwethers as rising geopolitical tensions always prompt the government to strengthen its arsenals. The hostile activities of North Korea and the U.S. administrations‘ repeated warnings to the nation, in response, provided a strong impetus to a number of defense majors, which scale new all-time highs in Q3.Moreover, in late August, while discussing his Afghanistan strategy, Trump announced plans to not to withdraw forces from the nation but “fight to win,” integrating diplomacy with military power. Following this announcement, defense stocks moved north in anticipation of escalated military actions. We believe Trump’s foreign policy will also provide further impetus to these stocks.Prudent DealsRecent merger deals between major aerospace and defense companies have also been acting as major catalysts for the industry.In September, United Technologies Corp. (UTX  -  Free Report) agreed to buy Rockwell Collins Inc. for $30 billion. Once completed, the deal will create one of the world’s largest aircraft-equipment manufacturers.With the acquisition, Rockwell Collins’ commercial and military aircraft avionics business will merge with United Technologies’ wide portfolio that includes aircraft engines, structures, cockpit and cabin controls, ventilation systems and other electronic and mechanical devices used in aviation.On the other hand, later in the same month, Northrop Grumman inked a deal to buy Orbital ATK  for $9.2 billion. With the acquisition, Northrop Grumman will benefit from Orbital ATK's rocket motors, missiles and electro-optical countermeasure product lines.5 Stocks Worth Adding to Your PortfolioWith the industry outperforming the broader market in the September quarter and promising to yield higher returns, we have shortlisted five defense stocks that have rallied more than 10% during the third quarter and have outperformed the S&P 500’s gain.The Boeing Co. (BA  -  Free Report) is the largest aircraft manufacturer in the world in terms of revenues, orders and deliveries. It is also one of the largest aerospace and defense contractors. Apart from manufacturing combat-proven military jets and high-end commercial aircraft, Boeing also produces missiles and related weapons and works in tandem with NASA in the Space Launch System.Boeing currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1171,NOC,"Textron Inc (TXT  -  Free Report) announced that its Aviation Defense segment has been awarded a $30-million contract for maintenance training of the Beechcraft King Air 350. This deal is part of foreign military sales (“FMS”) for Iraq. Work related to the contract will be carried out at the Martyr Mohammed Ali Air Base, Iraq. Operations are expected to be concluded by Sep 20, 2020. An amount of $9 million from the FMS fund will be obligated at the time of the award.Originally developed by Beechcraft, King Air 350 has more payload capability and range. It is designed for a quieter interior with standard Wi-Fi and Pro Line Fusion avionics with full touch-screen simplicity. The aircraft can fly at an altitude of 35,000 feet, thanks to its pressurized cabin and can take off and land on unimproved fields too.Importance of Foreign Military SalesForeign military sales became an important tool of generating revenue for the U.S. defense contractors, in addition to the orders received from the different verticals of U.S. Defense. Defense contracts from the U.S. allies helped the contractors maintain their top line during tough times. Moreover, when these contracts are carried on in the right manner, they help in strengthening the regional security, strengthen alliances, lighten United States' warfighting burden, improve the trade balance and create jobs.The Defense Contract Management Agency regulates the FMS contracts. The purchasers place the orders directly to the contractors. Instead, the agency acts as an intermediary and handles the procurement, logistics and delivery and often providing product support, training and infrastructure construction.What is Boosting Textron?Textron is globally recognized for popular and valuable brand names, such as Bell Helicopter, Cessna Aircraft Company, Jacobsen, Kautex, E-Z-GO and Greenlee.

At the end of 2016, the company completed the acquisition of Premier and SAFEAERO, manufacturers of aircraft de-icing equipment. These expansions are likely to contribute to the company’s overall growth in revenue, earnings and cash.The company and its peers, Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report), Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT  -  Free Report), The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) etc., are also expected to gain from the recently passed fiscal 2018 defense policy bill worth $700 billion by the U.S. Senate.

1177,NOC,"Monday, September 18, 2017This week brings us the latest Federal Market Open Committee (FOMC) two-day meeting, where Fed presidents from regions across the U.S. meet with Fed Chair Janet Yellen to discuss and decide on monetary policy. The participants convene tomorrow, and by Wednesday afternoon we look forward to a press conference with Yellen regarding any changes being made.Literally no one expects another rate hike this time around, but most analysts are looking toward a table set for unwinding the Fed’s $4.5 trillion on its balance sheet. Formerly, some had expected interest rates to rise further before the unwinding program was to begin; language used by the Fed in its recent meetings, however, give a clearer indication of how important the Fed members find this unwinding to be.There is an entire cottage industry dedicated to parsing phrases and changes to previous statements the Fed makes, and this week there is new material many will be interested in seeing whether the Fed will draw from. In short, these new findings are calling the current market among the most expensive — if not the most expensive — in history. A prominent strategist at Deutsche Bank (DB  -  Free Report) points out that an equal-weighted bond/equity portfolio has never been pricier. Morgan Stanley’s (MS  -  Free Report) Ruchir Sharma points out this is the first time we see all assets — from housing to stocks to bonds — at their highest levels of expense simultaneously.According to other reports, the market is valued at four times the real economy. We appear to be at stretching points seen in both 2000 and 2007 — the years directly preceding the two most recent major market crashes. And if it stands to reason that bubbles risks increase the longer low interest rates exist, then we may at very least see more of the Fed’s conversation take up this subject. Will the Fed begin to focus more on financial stability than merely its dual mandate of low unemployment and manageable inflation?One half of that dual mandate has been met for awhile now, but the other — inflation approaching 2% — has remained elusive, among low-to-no wage growth in the domestic labor market. Weekly metrics tracking inflation have remained frustrating to economists, demonstrating inflation creep only in fits and starts. No sooner do narratives about real traction for inflation seem to appear than new data points wipe away much of what’s asserted with a regressive swing the other direction.That all said, the market continues to look for new all-time highs this week. Global growth, the cooling of tensions on the Pacific Rim and even Washington DC, better-than-expected outcomes from two major hurricanes and better-than-expected growth metrics in things like the Empire State Index have all contributed to the very bullish climate. The Fed has an opportunity to throw something of a wet blanket on this hot market, but perhaps doing so will assist in preventing the next crash, or at least keeping it from being too painful.Northrop Grumman Buys Orbital ATKDefense giant Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report) has announced it will acquire rocket propulsion and munitions manufacturing company Orbital ATK  for $7.8 billion in cash. This amounts to roughly $134.50 plus debt, and has sent OA shares up nearly 20% on the news. Though the North Korea headlines seem to have ebbed lately, it would seem Northrop is looking to benefit from Orbital’s expertise in missile launch and weapons technology. The deal is expected to close in Q1 2018.Mark VickerySenior EditorQuestions or comments about this article and/or its author? Click here>>
