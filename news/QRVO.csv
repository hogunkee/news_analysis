3,QRVO,"Major iPhone chip suppliers saw their shares fall on Friday in response to Apple's (AAPL) December-quarter report and disappointing guidance late Thursday.Apple sold 77.3 million iPhones in the December quarter, vs. consensus expectations for 80 million. Its guidance for the current quarter implies sales of about 50 million iPhones, vs. consensus estimates for 59 million.Broadcom (AVGO) shares fell 1.4% to 235.46 on the stock market today. It gets about 20% of its revenue from Apple, according to RBC Capital Markets.Cirrus Logic (CRUS) stock tumbled 7.9% to 46.75.

It gets about 40% of its sales from Apple.""Apple's December-quarter print and March-quarter guide are slightly positive for the Apple supply chain, especially considering the negativity into the print coupled with underlying sell-through data being better,"" RBC analyst Amit Daryanani said in a report.RELATED:Apple Shares Flashed These 4 Sell Signals In Two WeeksApple Stock Plunges As Investors Digest Weak iPhone Sales, GuidanceApple Watch Mystery: How Many Sold In The Holiday Quarter?It's Time To Review Your Stock-Selling SmartsIs It Time To Get Into - Or Out Of - The Stock Market?Anatomy Of A Chart: Breaking Down The Buy And Sell Zones

4,QRVO,"Futures for the S&P 500 index and Nasdaq 100 were mixed vs. fair value early Thursday. Alibaba (BABA) fell 3% as the Chinese e-commerce giant fell shy of earnings estimates. Apple (AAPL) reports later tonight, along with Amazon (AMZN) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL)X Overnight, iPhone chipmaker Qorvo (QRVO) shot up on its earnings after Broadcom (AVGO) released positive sales figures early Wednesday, offering some hope for Apple's stock.Meanwhile, Facebook (FB) sold off initially on earnings late Wednesday but then rebounded. PayPal (PYPL) fell modestly in early after-hours action, but then plunged late in the session,S&P 500 index futures were fractionally higher vs. fair value. Nasdaq 100 and Dow futures fell 0.1%.Keep in mind that extended trading does not always translate into how a stock will open or close in the followingvvv regular session. Volume will be much heavier, while analysts and investors will have more time to sift through the figures and comments.Facebook topped adjusted earnings and sales growth estimates, but shares sold off more than 4% in early after-hours trading after CEO Mark Zuckerberg said changes to its News Feed reduced users' time on the site by 50 million hours every day. Daily active users in the U.S. and Canada fell for the first time ever, falling to 184 million users from 185 million in Q3.But late in the post-earnings call with analysts, Facebook said ad rates have soared. COO Sheryl Sandberg said News Feed changes may reduce how much time people spend on Facebook but shouldn't affect profitability. Facebook turned higher and was up about 1% in premarket trading.Facebook closed down 0.1% at 186.89 in Wednesday's stock market trading.The online payments processor reported a 30% earnings-per-share gain for the fourth quarter. PayPal also gave largely in-line guidance for 2018. Shares initially fell modestly in late trade after rising to a record high during Wednesday's regular session. But then former parent eBay (EBAY), which also reported earnings after hours, said it would drop PayPal as its online payment provider for Dutch firm Adyen. The eBay deal with PayPal doesn't fully end until 2020 and eBay said it'll accept PayPal as an option until at least July 2023. But PayPal fell much further, trading down more than 8% in premarket action.Qorvo reported better-than-expected fiscal Q3 results late Wednesday, but guided low for the current Q4, citing weaker handset sales. That offered further, implicit confirmation that Apple will cut guidance when it reports holiday-quarter results Thursday night.But Qorvo shot up 11.5% to 80 in late trade. That's after rising nearly 6% so far this week, retaking its 50-day and 200-day moving average. Admittedly, Qorvo's late-night gains likely reflect the company's hints that it will get a bigger share of chips in the iPhone.But Qorvo's recent action also suggests the bad news may be priced in, at least for iPhone chipmakers.Before Wednesday's open, Broadcom, another Apple chipmaker, reported preliminary sales that were above estimates, while also guiding high for current-quarter revenue. Shares rose 2.9% during the regular session, though they closed below their 200-day moving average.As for Apple itself, the tech titan's shares closed up 0.3% to 167.43.Apple is still down for 2018, trading well below its 50-day moving average and a 176.35 flat-base buy point. Worse, the relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, is holding at its worst levels since mid-June. Investors should be focusing on stocks that are truly leading the market.Qorvo and other suppliers and other measures suggest that Apple is seeing weaker iPhone X demand.

6,QRVO,"Apple (AAPL) hit a record high Tuesday morning, looking at first glance like a market leader after reclaiming a buy point Friday. But Friday's move had some glaring weaknesses and by Tuesday's close Apple retreated to settle just under its entry area again.X Meanwhile, iPhone chipmakers such as Broadcom (AVGO), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), Qorvo (QRVO), which have been market laggards in the past several weeks, hit key resistance Tuesday. But Qualcomm (QCOM) made a big move.On Tuesday, Apple hit a record high of 179.39, but reversed with the market, closing down 0.5% to 176.19, back below the 176.34 flat-base buy point.Apple rose 1% to 177.09 on Friday, reclaiming the 173.64 entry. That wasn't an especially powerful price gain. Meanwhile, volume was 7% below normal. You want to see trading activity rise at least 40%-50% above average on breakouts and moves into buy zones.Apple's relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, is well off recent highs. (The RS line is the blue line in the stock charts below.) Friday's 1% stock move, not much more than the S&P 500's 0.7% advance, did little to change that. You want to see a stock's RS line lead or confirm a breakout or move into a buy area.Apple's RS line hasn't made headway since early May. Even when Apple briefly broke out on Dec. 18, the stock's RS line was off its prior highs.Can Apple's move into buy zone work? If the market continues to power ahead, then there's a good chance that Apple's stock will continue to climb. It's also possible that Apple will begin to outperform the S&P 500 significantly again.Investors should try to focus on stocks that will deliver the strongest gains, while minimizing the risk of losses, especially big losses.Apple reports earnings on Feb. 1.Broadcom is currently in a flat base with a 285.78 buy point. Broadcom sank 0.4% to 263.25 after finding resistance at its 50-day moving average. The RS line has fallen to its lowest levels since early July or early May. That reflects a series of flat bases on top of or next to each other without making much headway.IBD'S TAKE: With the market now in a confirmed rally for 100 days, it can be hard to see who are the true leading stocks and which are in the middle of the pack. See why IBD's relative strength line is so important.Qualcomm is an interesting case for two reasons.First, the wireless chip giant is in a royalties battle with key customer Apple, as well as related legal and regulatory challenges and probes around the world. Those woes helped send the stock crashing from October 2016 to last September.Second, Broadcom is making a now-hostile bid for Qualcomm, so the latter's shares skyrocketed in November. Since peaking in late November, Qualcomm and Broadcom shares have  generally moved in a similar fashion. Then again, so has Skyworks Solutions.But Qualcomm separated from Broadcom on Tuesday, climbing 4.4% to 68.25 as it laid out its case for staying independent, offering bullish 2019 targets.Qualcomm is in a huge cup-with-handle base. If you prefer, you can view the handle as a flat base on its own. Either way, the buy point would be 69.38. Shares closed Friday at 65.38, finding support at its fast-rising 50-day line.Qualcomm's RS line has lagged badly since late Nov. 24, reflecting the stock's underperformance over that time. But the RS did get a nice bounce Tuesday with shares rising and the major averages retreating.Skyworks Solutions is in a consolidation essentially next to two prior patterns that had short-lived breakouts. Skyworks has a 117.75 buy point. Shares closed Friday at 101.21, continuing to trade below its 50-day and 200-day line. The 50-day line last week fell below the 200-day, negative technical action known as a bearish cross.Meanwhile, the RS line peaked in early June and is now just off its lowest levels in a year.Skyworks found resistance at its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, reversing lower to close off 1.3% at 99.86.Qorvo, like Skyworks, is in a consolidation next to a pair of bases with breakouts that soon failed. It's also below its 50-day and 200-day moving averages. The RS line is right around the lowest levels in a year after peaking last May.Qorvo is in a consolidation with an 81.30 buy point, but has a lot of work to do. Qorvo sank 2.45% to 69.30 on Tuesday, finding resistance at its 200-day line.Analog Devices (ADI) and Integrated Device Technology (IDTI), both seen as iPhone X plays, are both in shallow, short cup bases. The RS lines are lagging, though a powerful stock gain could lift these stocks' RS lines above at least a short-term high from their recent pseudo-handles (they are not proper handles). Keep in mind that the RS lines have basically been flat for a year. Integrated Device's earnings have been spotty.Analog Devices rose 1.2% to 93.10, closing in on a 94.09 entry. Integrated Devices fell 1.7%.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:These 4 Top Tech Stocks With Strong RS Lines Hit Buy PointsA Stock Rises Again After Its First Breakout Fails; Should You Buy Again?Facebook Tumbles Below Buy Point; Why Breakout Was Never 'Meaningful'When Will You Know The Top Stocks' Big Runs Are Over?

The sanctions, imposed on Janet Yellen's final day as head of the Fed, stirred concerns that regulators, under Powell, could be set for a more authoritarian turn.The Nasdaq composite dropped 3.8%, with Apple (AAPL) carving 2.5% lower and, among the FANG tech leaders, Alphabet (GOOGL) and Netflix (NFLX) down about 5%.A couple of brief intraday market rebound attempts quickly collapsed, although bonds took back some ground, driving the 10-year yield to 2.79% from 2.84% as both the dollar and commodities traded mixed.Big Oil names were again key contributors to the day's declines, as U.S. benchmark crude dropped more than 2%, to just below $64 a barrel.  Exxon-Mobil (XOM) and  Chevron (CVX) led the downside on the Dow, each skidding more than 5%. Total (TOT) and BP (BP) fell sharply.Among other Dow components, Boeing (BA) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) dived 6% and 5%. United Technologies' (UTX) decline reached 5.5% as the stock fell below the 50-day line.Shipping was the session's strongest industry, buoyed by a 3% gap up from Kirby (KEX). The inland and coastal waterways operation announced it would buy barge transportation outfit Higman Marine for $419 million. Kirby shares are extended after a breakout from a cup-with-handle base in January.China-based stocks took some bruises, led by Sina's (SINA) 4% fall. The firm-volume decline droves shares to a test of their 10-week moving average. Sina is less than 4% below a 113.05 buy point in a double-bottom base — avoiding an automatic sell rule.Chips traded broadly lower, despite the ostensibly positive news that Broadcom (AVGO) had ratcheted up its bid to acquire Qualcomm (QCOM) to more than $121 billion. Broadcom lost 3% and Qualcomm skittered nearly 6% lower.Among other chip leaders, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) gave up 7%, Qorvo (QRVO) declined 6%, Xilinx (XLNX) took a 5% loss.Graphics chip leader Nvidia (NVDA) unspooled an 8.5% decline. Shares ended just at the 50-day moving average, and just below a 218.77 buy point in a cup with handle base.RELATED:Dow Suffers Worst Point Drop Ever, But Percentage Loss Not HistoricStocks Continue Wild Action Late; These 3 Chipmakers Move On EarningsFed's Wells Fargo Punishment Sets Precedent For Harsher Era Broadcom Raises Bid For Qualcomm, Calls It 'Best and Final Offer'It's Time To Review Your Stock-Selling SmartsHow Do You Spot A Major Stock Market Top?

Nasdaq 100 futures fell 1.5%.

Analysts had seen EPS of $1.63 and sales of $946.1 million.But that bad news may be priced into the stock, following weak guidance from Qorvo (QRVO), Qualcomm (QCOM) and Apple (AAPL) itself last week.Skyworks also announced a $1 billion stock-buyback program, equal to 5.8% of the float based on the current $17.34 billion market cap.Skyworks shares rose 2.5% early Tuesday.But that follows a 4.3% tumble to 94.68 Monday, the lowest since Dec. 26.

14,QRVO,"Futures for the S&P 500 index, Dow industrials and Nasdaq 100 tumbled Monday morning as last week's selling pressure carries over. Broadcom (AVGO) raised its bid for fellow Apple (AAPL) iPhone chip supplier Qualcomm (QCOM) to $120 billion.X Stocks sold off Friday, led by Apple, Alphabet (GOOGL) and Chevron (CVX).

You could argue that the market is ""due"" for a correction, but that doesn't mean it has to be now.IBD'S TAKE: As an investor, don't try to guess what the market is going to do. Instead, listen to what the market is saying right now by following the major averages and leading stocks. Read IBD's The Big Picture every market day.Stocks that have not been true leaders, such as Apple, are being exposed. Others, like Alibaba (BABA) and Chevron, that had recently looked strong, have tumbled below buy points. A few, like Amazon (AMZN), have kept rallying to new highs.Broadcom's new bid is for $82 a share, up from the current $70 a share. Broadcom, which say this is its ""best and final"" offer, aims to push Qualcomm to negotiate. It's mounting an effort to replace the entire board of Qualcomm at the latter's March 9 shareholder meeting.Broadcom last week reported strong preliminary revenue earnings and upbeat sales guidance, giving the stock a brief lift on Wednesday. But shares fell back to their lowest levels since late September on Friday, as iPhone chipmakers fell on Apple's weak handset sales and current-quarter guidance, as well a big iPhone chip contract win for Qorvo (QRVO) at the expense of Broadcom didn't help.Qualcomm topped fiscal Q1 earnings views but gave weak guidance. The chipmaker, which faces regulatory fines and curbs over its royalty and licensing terms around the world, has a related dispute with Apple. Qualcomm also is trying to close a $47 billion takeover of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI). But it's struggled to do so as top NXP Semi investors want a higher price.Qualcomm stock, which skyrocketed in November on the initial $103 billion takeover bid from Broadcom, closed below its 50-day line on Friday at 66.07.You can view Qualcomm as being in a flat base or in a huge cup-with-handle pattern going back to late 2016. Either way, the buy point is 69.38.Qualcomm shares initially popped but have turned flat. Monday. Broadcom fell a fraction.Bristol-Myers Squibb reported fourth-quarter earnings of 68 cents a share on revenue of $5.45 billion early Monday. Analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research had called for adjusted profit of 67 cents and revenue of $5.306 billion.

16,QRVO,"Futures for the S&P 500 index futures turned sharply lower Friday morning as a global bond sell-off continued with the U.S. January jobs report on tap. Nasdaq 100 futures reversed sharply, with Amazon (AMZN) still booming on Q4 results but Apple (AAPL) giving up most of its post-earnings gains.X The 10-year Treasury yield traded at 2.79%, continuing its strong 2018 rise. The 30-year yield topped 3% for the first time in years Thursday. The Bank of Japan said it would buy 5- and 10-year government debt after the 10-year Japanese yield threatened to top 0.1%. German bund yields are multiyear highs.S&P 500 index futures fell 0.6% vs. fair value. Dow futures sank 0.8%, or more than 200 points. Nasdaq 100 futures, up solidly Thursday night, lost 0.7%.Separately, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies continued to plunge as regulators and Facebook (FB) crack down and euphoria fades following a climax-type run that peaked in December. Bitcoin dipped below $8,000 Friday morning, currently down 12% to $7,968.23, according to CoinDesk. Bitcoin crashed below $9,000 on Thursday.The January employment report is due at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists expect to see nonfarm payrolls up 175,000 and the jobless rate holding at 4.1%. But the focus may be on average hourly wages, which are seen up 0.3% vs. December and 2.6% vs. a year earlier.Apple reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue for the holiday fiscal first quarter, though iPhone shipments missed forecasts. Apple guided current-quarter revenue forecasts sharply lower. Shares rose more than 3% late Thursday, but with futures tumbling Apple was up just 0.6%.Extended trading often doesn't translate into the following session. There is a strong case that Apple's bad news was already priced in the stock price. Several analysts warned of weaker iPhone production and demand leading up to the earnings report. That sent the stock below a recent buy point and its 50-day moving average, even as the broader market was soaring in January.But on the other hand, Apple's news wasn't great. And the AAPL stock chart is still in bad shape. The relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, has been lagging for months, and recently hit its worst levels since mid-June. Technically, a 176.34 buy point is still valid, though you'd want to see the RS line top at least short-term highs to provide some confirmation.Apple, which is the biggest member of the S&P 500 index, Nasdaq composite and Dow industrials, also gave a boost to iPhone-related stocks such as Broadcom (AVGO), Applied Materials (AMAT) and Universal Display (AVGO).Broadcom rose 0.5% early Friday. But the chipmaker, which set a four-month closing low Thursday, is stuck below its 50-day and 200-moving averages.Applied Materials is a chip- and display-equipment maker. It is not an Apple supplier, but some analysts have pegged it as an iPhone X play due to its involvement in OLED displays. Applied Materials rose 1% late Thursday but reversed to down about 1% early Friday. Applied Materials is in a cup-with-handle base, but the stock is finding resistance at its 50-day moving average.Universal Display also is not an Apple supplier, but as its OLED ticker suggests, makes technology used in producing the high-end screens for premium smartphones. Universal Display rose 3.9% early Friday. The stock had closed at its lowest level in almost three months after a January breakout broke down.Qorvo (QRVO) is an iPhone chipmaker, but shares weren't that active overnight. They might be tired after skyrocketing 16% to close at 83.34, clearing an 81.30 cup buy point. Qorvo guided lower late Wednesday, but touted a big Apple contract win that will increase its iPhone business, at the expense of Broadcom.Amazon reported blowout earnings, helped by a big tax-cut benefit, while revenue also topped. Shares rose 5.7% early Friday after falling 4.2% Thursday. Amazon has been a huge winner so far in 2018 after clearing a late-stage base.Meanwhile, Amazon's upside was offset by Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and Amgen (AMGN), which both missed on earnings.

17,QRVO,"The S&P 500 index and other major averages had their first down week of 2018, and it was their worst showing in two years. Apple (AAPL) guided lower, as many suspected. Amazon (AMZN) and Boeing (BA) delivered strong results while Facebook (FB) touted strong ad rates. Alibaba (BABA) missed on earnings. PayPal (PYPL) crashed as former parent eBay (EBAY) moved to cut ties. A move by Amazon, JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) to team up to tackle health care costs hit insurers and pharmacy benefit managers. The Bitcoin meltdown continuedX After a hot start to 2018, the major averages suffered their worst weekly losses in two years, with the S&P 500 down 3.9%, the Dow 4.1% and the Nasdaq 3.5% as rising bond yields worldwide pressured stocks. UnitedHealth (UNH), CVS Health (CVS) and many other insurers fell on an Amazon-JPMorgan-Berkshire health care joint venture. Amazon, Boeing and Facebook were earnings winners, Alibaba was a notable loser, while Apple (AAPL) did OK.Bitcoin plummeted below $8,000 as 2018 losses accelerate as Facebook joined a chorus of regulators worldwide cracking down on cryptocurrencies.Apple (AAPL) earnings per share rose 16% year over year, on sales of $88.3 billion, up 13%, for the fiscal first quarter. Both narrowly beat expectations. Apple sold 77.3 million iPhones vs. the consensus for 80 million units, but average selling prices due to its new iPhone X and iPhone 8 models fueled overall results. For the March quarter, Apple expects sales of $61 billion, based on the midpoint of guidance, below official estimates for $65.4 billion. Shares fell 4.3% on Friday to a new three-month low.The e-commerce leader reported adjusted earnings of $3.75 a share, smashing the consensus of $1.85. A big benefit from tax cuts helped. Revenue rose 38% to $60.5 billion, also beating. Revenue from Amazon Web Services rose 46% to $5.1 billion. Sales of its Echo line of smart speakers far exceed expectations, Amazon (AMZN) said. Shares gained 3%, hitting a new high intraday.Facebook (FB) reported robust earnings and revenue growth that topped Q4 forecasts. User growth cooled while users' time spent on Facebook fell, even before its latest big News Feed changes. But executives said on the conference call that ad rates are soaring, easing analysts' revenue fears. Shares hit a record high Thursday.Alphabet (GOOGL) shares fell after the Google parent reported Q4 adjusted earnings were $9.70 a share, up 28% from a year earlier, missing views. Traffic acquisition costs, what Google pays partner websites to carry ads, soared 33% to $6.45 billion. Google expects the rise in TAC to moderate after Q1. Google's rising TAC has been linked to a contract renewal with Apple as well as internet searches shifting to mobile phones. Revenue rose 24% to $32.32 billion, topping consensus. The adjusted EPS excluded the impact of tax reform, which resulted in additional expense of $9.9 billion.Amazon's Jeff Bezos, JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon and Berkshire's Warren Buffett said the new nonprofit company is aimed at reducing costs for their employees. But if they are successful with their own firms, the thinking is that they would expand the services to corporate America. Health insurers and pharmacy benefit managers sold off. UnitedHealth, the largest U.S. health insurer and also a PBM, sank 6.7%. Drugstore-and-PBM CVS Health (CVS), which is buying insurer Aetna (AET), lost 6.8%. Pure-play PBM Express Scripts (ESRX) retreated 5.9%.PayPal (PYPL) reported strong earnings and in-line guidance, while former parent eBay (EBAY) reported in-line Q4 earnings but stronger-than-expected gross merchandise volume. But the real news was that eBay stunned Wall Street with the news that it will replace PayPal in 2020 and handle payments on its own site via a partnership with Adyen. The move will add a revenue stream. Shares of eBay soared nearly 14% on Thursday. PayPal lost 10.4% for the week, closing below a buy point and its 50-day line.The Chinese e-commerce giant's revenue soared 56% to $12.8 billion, the best gain in at least 15 quarters and beating views. Earnings per U.S. share climbed 25%, but slightly missed forecasts. Alibaba will buy a 33% stake in Ant Financial, a former unit that runs payments service Alipay. That replaces a deal in which Alibaba got 37.5% of Ant Financial's pretax profit. Alibaba will provide some intellectual property but not cash. The move clears hurdles for a possible Ant Financial IPO. Alibaba shares 8.7% for the week, tumbling below a recent buy point.The U.S. added 200,000 jobs in January, better than expected. Average hourly wages surged 2.9% vs. a year earlier, far above views and the best since 2009. The ISM manufacturing index continued to point to raid employment gains. While fast growth and wage gains are good news, they could spur the Federal Reserve to raise rates more aggressively this year.The software leader reported adjusted earnings per share of 96 cents, up 20% year over year, on sales of $28.9 billion, up 12%, for its fiscal second quarter. Analysts expected 86 cents and $28.4 billion. Microsoft got a lift from its cloud computing businesses, including Azure, Office 365 and Dynamics. For the current quarter, Microsoft guided to earnings per share of 83 cents on sales of $25.6 billion, above views. Shares hit a record high intraday Thursday.AMD (AMD), Broadcom (AVGO) and Qorvo (QRVO) offered investors positive financial news. AMD beat Wall Street's targets for the December quarter and guided estimates higher for the current quarter. Broadcom gave preliminary sales and earnings guidance for its fiscal first quarter that topped views. Qorvo rocketed after disclosing a big contract win with major customer Apple (AAPL) for its next-generation iPhone. Qorvo delivered better-than-expected results for its fiscal Q3, but guided well below Wall Street's targets for the current quarter.Boeing (BA) reported EPS of $4.80 a share, or $3.06 excluding a $1.74 per-share benefit from tax cuts. Either way, Boeing beat analyst views for $2.91. Revenue climbed 9% to $25.37 billion, also topping views. Boeing also guided 2018 EPS and revenue forecasts higher. Tax cuts will spur more investment and makes the case for new midmarket jet more compelling. Boeing also got a $6.6 billion missile defense contract from the Pentagon. UPS (UPS) ordered 14 new 747 jets, giving the venerable jumbo jet a new lifeline. Meanwhile, Lockheed Martin (LMT) EPS jumped 32% to $4.30 while revenue rose 10% to $15.1 billion. The defense giant guided 2018 EPS views higher.Boeing shares rose 1.7% this week and Lockheed 2.25%, both hitting new highs.Video game publisher Electronic Arts (EA) saw its stock surge to a record high after reporting big gains in online services associated with its sports game franchises FIFA and Madden NFL. The boost in Live Services was revealed as part of EA's in-line December-quarter earnings report. Video game hardware and software firm Nintendo (NTDOY) posted better-than-expected December-quarter results thanks to the continued success of its Switch console and related software. Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) announced a major delay to its highly anticipated Wild West action game ""Red Dead Redemption 2,"" now set for release on Oct. 26 instead of this spring.Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA) topped analyst forecasts, as people broke out the plastic more often to spend during the holidays. Visa also OK'd a $7.5 billion buyback. That follows American Express (AXP), which just suspended its buyback. Visa also hiked its quarterly cash dividend to 21 cents a share.Homebuilder stocks continued to struggle even as some big builders reported better-than-expected earnings after the prior week's surprise miss by NVR (NVR). Housing demand and prices are strong, but concerns are growing over rising labor and material costs. Mortgage rates, though low, are rising. America's largest homebuilder D.R. Horton (DHI) beat on both EPS and revenue Wednesday, but shares met resistance at their 50-day line. PulteGroup (PHM) stock kept falling on sliding gross margins, even though earnings and sales topped views. Smaller Meritage Homes (MTH) also beat while smaller M/I Homes (MHO)  and M.D.C. Holdings (MDC) missed on EPS.A slew of biotechs and drugmakers reported earnings, including Pfizer (PFE), Eli Lilly (LLY), Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), AstraZeneca (AZN) and Merck (MRK), all of which topped Wall Street's fourth-quarter earnings expectations. Pfizer came in with $13.7 billion in sales and adjusted profit of 62 cents per share. Lilly's total sales grew 7% to $6.16 billion and the firm brought in adjusted income of $1.14 per share. Vertex reported sales of $651.6 million and adjusted profit of 61 cents per share. AstraZeneca reported core earnings of $1.30 per share and $5.78 billion in sales.

Both shares plunged below their 50-day lines, with Chevron undercutting a recent buy point. Separately, U.S. crude production continues to hit fresh longtime highs, while crude supplies rose for the first time in 11 weeks. Crude futures remain near three-year highs.Ferrari (RACE) gapped into a buy zone after reporting strong earnings Thursday.

Start HereQorvo broke out earlier, but has fallen back below the prior 81.30 entry from a cup without handle. In the case where a stock breaks out then falls 7% or more below the entry price, it's considered a failed breakout. If that happens, it's best to wait for a new pattern to take shape. Also understand that the latest consolidation is a later-stage base, which makes it riskier to establish a new position or add shares to an existing one. In terms of top and bottom line numbers, the company has posted two quarters of increasing earnings growth. Top line growth has also risen over the same time frame. The company earns the No. 10 rank among its peers in the Electronics-Semiconductor Manufacturing industry group. Microchip Technology (MCHP), Intel (INTC) and Microsemi (MSCC) are among the top 5 highly rated stocks within the group.RELATED:Chip Stocks To Watch And Semiconductor Industry NewsStocks With Rising Relative Strength RatingsWhy Should You Use IBD's Relative Strength Rating?How Relative Strength Line Can Help You Judge A Stock

China's regulators initially planned to launch their response, with duties targeting $34 billion in U.S. made imports, at 12:01 a.m. Beijing time. That would have effectively imposed tariffs on U.S. goods beginning just after noon, Thursday, on the U.S. East Coast.A statement Wednesday from China's ruling State Council said ""China absolutely won't fire the first shot."" That suggested China would not launch its tariffs until noon, Beijing time, on Friday.The Shanghai Composite dropped 0.9%, giving it a 4% loss so far in its seventh-straight weekly decline. The benchmark entered a bear market on June 19. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index slipped 0.2%, down 2.7% for the week but it has yet to hit the 20% decline from its February high to qualify as a bear market.In Japan, Tokyo's Nikkei 225 slumped 0.8% on Thursday.

23,QRVO,"Stocks opened lower Thursday as overseas markets lost ground and an inflation gauge jumped unexpectedly, while a barrage of earnings news fueled busy early trade.X The Dow Jones industrial average dug a 0.4% hole, as Nike (NKE) slipped to the bottom of the index, and Visa's (V) posted the only early gain of better than 1%. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.3%, with PayPal (PYPL), Tractor Supply (TSCO) and Vodafone (VOD) putting up the Nasdaq 100's largest opening declines.The S&P 500 dipped 0.2%, bolstered by Qorvo (QRVO), eBay (EBAY) and Vertex (VRTX).Now in the thick of earnings season, Microsoft (MSFT), Facebook (FB), Qualcomm (QCOM) and United Parcel Service (UPS) were among the many notable names reacting to quarter results early Thursday. Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Visa (V) are all set to report after today's closing bell.Visa led the Dow, up 1.3% ahead of its quarterly report, as Nike dived 1.7% in opening trade.Microsoft edged up 0.4%. Its cloud-computing business drove fourth-quarter results well ahead of analyst targets, the company reported late Wednesday. Shares are extended, up 10% since clearing a flat base in December.S&P 500 component Qorvo spiked 11% as analysts upgraded the stock following its fiscal third-quarter report after Wednesday's close. The supplier of chips for Apple's iPhone is trading just below an 81.30 buy point in a cup base, and up almost 18% so far this week.Facebook traded 2% higher, recovered from an after hours dip late Thursday after the social media giant reported better-than-forecast results for the fourth quarter, but raised concerns about the effect from changes to its News Feed. Shares are still in their buy range, above a 184.35 buy point.EBay and Nokia each vaulted more than 12% as investors responded to their quarterly performances. Information technology service firm NIC (EGOV) posted one the session's most perilous early declines, down 17%.PayPal fell 8% at the open. EBay announced during its earnings report late Wednesday that it would curtail its use of PayPal in 2020, and switch to digital payments provider Ayden. The loss sent shares back below the buy point of a flat base they had cleared in early January, but stopped short before cutting the stock's 10-week moving average.Alibaba Group Holdings (BABA) gave up almost 6% after a mixed fiscal third-quarter report. The China-based e-commerce leader also announced it had retaken a 33% share in ANT Financial, the unit it had spun off in 2011. The loss erased the stock's gain above a 191.85 buy point from a flat base from which it had broken out on Jan. 23.Economic news ahead of Friday payrolls report showed layoffs announced by U.S. employers surged 38% month-over-month in January to 44,653, according to the Job Cuts Report from Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Layoffs ran almost 3% lower than in January 2017, the report said. Retailers led January's payrolls reductions, laying off 15,378 workers — almost 32% fewer cuts than the 22,491 layoffs announced in January last year.First-time unemployment claims were roughly even, at 231,000, in the week ended Jan. 27, the Labor Department said. That compared with 233,000 claims in the prior week, below projections for an uptick to 235,000 new applications.The Labor Department's preliminary estimate on fourth-quarter productivity showed a 0.1% dip, far below the monster 2.7% surge in the third quarter as well as consensus estimates for a 1.1% increase. Unit labor costs popped 2%, vs. a 0.2% decline in the third quarter and estimates for a 0.9% increase — adding to inflation fears raised by the Fed on Wednesday.The dollar reversed some of its recent gains vs. the yen, buoyed by the wary view toward inflation conveyed in Wednesday's policy announcement from the Federal Reserve. Stocks in Japan responded, sending Tokyo's Nikkei 225 to a muscular rebound, up 1.7%, and ending the six-day decline that had followed currency comments from U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in Davos, Switzerland, last week.China's markets continued lower, with the Shanghai Composite down 1% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index taking a 0.8% loss.In Europe, markets turned lower in afternoon trade.

24,QRVO,"Apple (AAPL) is expected to deliver solid earnings growth for the December-ending fiscal first quarter on Thursday. But several analysts expect Apple to guide lower for the current March quarter due to weakening iPhone X demand. But what is the stock chart telling us right now?X Apple should report a 14% earnings per share gain to $3.82 with revenue climbing 10% to $86.02 billion. For Q2, the consensus is for year-over-year growth to accelerate, with EPS up 38% to $2.10 and sales swelling 26% to $66.54 billion. But some see sales as low as $62 billion.Shares of the Dow Jones industrial average component fell 3.9% in last week's stock market trading to 171.51. The stock fell below a flat-base buy point of 176.34 and its 50-day moving average in the heaviest weekly volume since the week ended Nov. 3.Meanwhile, the S&P 500 index advanced 2.2% last week to a record high. That big divergence between the S&P 500 and the world's most valuable company underscored Apple's current status as a lagging stock, not a leader. Apple shares fell 2.1% to 167.96 on Monday, turning slightly negative for 2018.The relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, has been trending lower since early November. Even as the stock cleared its buy point several times in recent weeks, the RS was well off its highs. The RS line (the blue line in the chart below), sank to its lowest level since June.Apple retreated 0.6% Tuesday to close at 166.97, falling intraday to its lowest level in nearly three months. The RS line rose slightly as Apple fell a little less than the S&P 500, which fell 1.1%.Investors should be looking for stocks with RS lines that lead or confirm breakouts.Apple's weakness is backed up by trouble with iPhone-related stock plays, including Apple chipmakers and companies involved in the OLED screens used in the iPhone X and other high-end electronic devices. However, Qorvo (QRVO) shares did jump 3.6% on Tuesday, retaking its 50-day moving average ahead of its earnings Wednesday.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter.Apple bulls are hoping that the iPhone giant will deliver standout holiday quarter results and offer guidance that's strong or at least not as bad as many analysts fear. If so, Apple shares could rally. But it's dangerous for investors to try to prove that they know better than the collective knowledge of the market. The way to outperform the broader averages consistently is to listen to what the market is saying right now.And right now — not last year, not two weeks in the future — the market is cool on Apple.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:The Big Picture: Stocks Soar; These 5 Mega-Cap Techs Are On DeckThese 7 Stocks With 99 Composite Ratings Have Earnings This WeekFacebook, Apple, Amazon To Grab Earnings Spotlight: Investing Action PlanThese 3 Top Stocks Are Near Buy Points; This Leader Just Broke OutThese Four IBD 50 Tech Stocks Are In Buy RangeEarnings Preview: Will FANG Names, Other Hot Growth Stocks Deliver Stellar Results?

25,QRVO,"Investors should follow the action of the major averages and leading stocks. So what did they tell us on Thursday? 1. The dollar is a big market driver, especially for multinationals. 2. Apple (AAPL) and a slew of iPhone-related stocks continue to lag and break key technical levels. 3. Overnight trading is not always confirmed in the next day's regular-session trades.X S&P 500 index futures rose 0.3% vs. fair value in early Friday morning trading. Nasdaq 100 futures advanced 0.45%.Stocks opened higher in Thursday's market trading in part on overnight comments by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin that ""a weaker dollar is good"" for U.S. trade, sending the greenback to a fresh three-year low. But President Trump told CNBC on Thursday afternoon that Mnuchin's comments were taken out of context and he sees the dollar strengthening. That sent the dollar higher, closing little changed. The major averages pulled back on Trump, then steadied at the close along with the currency.A weaker greenback makes U.S. exports more competitive and flatters companies' overseas profits in dollar terms. So shares of U.S. companies with big exposure to foreign markets tend to do better with a falling dollar.Apple's relative weakness has been a steady theme in the evening Stock Market Today column. A day after falling below a recent flat-base buy point in heavy volume, Apple slid 1.8% to 171.11 on mounting concerns over iPhone X demand. The stock closed modestly below its 50-day moving average. Meanwhile, the relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, slumped to its worst level since July. (The RS line is the blue line in the chart below.)That underperformance is magnified by the action of iPhone-related stocks.Broadcom (AVGO) fell below its 200-day moving average for the first time in nearly two years, joining fellow iPhone chipmakers Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Qorvo (QRVO). All three stocks' RS lines are at 52-week lows.Universal Display (OLED), which makes technology used in making OLED screens for high-end phones like the iPhone X and other devices, tumbled 5.7% to 168.25. That's part of a 19% five-day sell-off, plunging Universal Display below a buy point and its 50-day moving average. That follows another failed OLED-related breakout: laser maker Coherent (COHR).There's an old Russian proverb that morning is wiser than the evening. That's certainly something to keep in mind with after-hours action. In the midst of earnings season you'll see dozens of stocks soaring or tumbling after the market close or before the opening bell. Sometimes that carries over to the next regular trading session, but sometimes the action is radically different.There are many reasons why. Extended trading, even when relatively heavy, is thin compared with activity in regular exchange hours. Investors may miss key details initially that are picked up on later. Companies sometimes hold conference calls the next morning or after the opening bell.In late trading Wednesday, Lam Research (LRCX) and Xilinx (XLNX) rallied on earnings and looked set to at least test buy points. But after opening higher, the chip stocks reversed sharply lower, both closing down about 5%.Keep that in mind for Friday's regular session. Industry giant Intel (INTC) rallied in extended trading on its earnings report and sales guidance. That's a hopeful sign for how Intel will trade in normal hours, but no guarantee.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:The Big Picture: Blue Chips Advance, But Breakouts Sparse After Facebook And Google Breakouts, This Internet Stock May Be Next 3 China Names In Buy Range; Can You Find The Strengths, Flaws?Where To Look For Dominance In The Stock MarketHighflying New Issue Looks To Add To Its Big 2017 Post-IPO GainsIntel Rises Late On Strong Earnings, Guidance

27,QRVO,"Futures for the S&P 500 index were little changed early Wednesday morning after the major averages hit record highs Tuesday. Apple (AAPL) just closed higher on Tuesday as another analyst warned of sluggish or falling iPhone X demand. Apple's relative strength line, which tracks a stock vs. the S&P 500 index, has slumped to a multimonth low.X Meanwhile, stocks influenced by iPhone demand are faring worse, raising another red flag for Apple. Universal Display (OLED) tumbled below a buy point following a failed breakout by fellow OLED play Coherent (COHR). And iPhone chipmakers such as Broadcom (AVGO) and Skyworks (SWKS) continue to trade near recent lows.S&P 500 index futures were essentially flat vs. fair value. Futures for the Dow industrial average rose a fraction. Nasdaq 100 futures sank 0.1%.Apple rose as high as 179.44 in Tuesday's stock market trading, but retreated to close with a 4-cent gain to 177.04 after JPMorgan cited evidence of flagging demand for the iPhone X, the latest bearish analyst prediction for Apple.The stock is still above a recent 176.34 flat-base buy point. But Apple has been sluggish even as the major averages have been surging higher. Apple's RS line is now at the lowest level since the stock's prior breakout on Oct. 27. (The RS line is the blue line in the charts below.) Apple hasn't made much headway vs. the S&P 500 since early May. Investors want to focus on stocks that are truly leading the market.Apple shares fell a fraction in late trading Tuesday.Universal Display makes tech used in creating organic light-emitting diode (OLED) screens, used in the iPhone X and a growing number of high-end phones and TVs.The stock cleared a 192.85 buy point on Jan. 8 and rose as high as 209 intraday Friday. But shares have fallen for three straight sessions, tumbling 4.9% to 189.35 on Tuesday in more than double normal volume.Meanwhile, Coherent, which makes lasers used in the OLED production process, skidded 5.4% to 282.59, falling below its 50-day moving average. Coherent jumped on Jan. 17 to close just above a 320.83 buy point, but has sold off since then.When Apple catches a cold, iPhone chipmakers often get sick. Broadcom, Skyworks and Qorvo (QRVO) are all below their 50-day moving averages, with the latter two also below their 200-day lines. Broadcom's RS line is at a nine-month low. The RS lines for Skyworks and Qorvo are at 52-week lows.Texas Instruments (TXN) also supplies some Apple chips, and it's been a highflier, mostly on its prospects in the automotive and Internet of Things markets. But shares tumbled 7% late Tuesday after Texas Instruments failed to beat earnings estimates or lift guidance. That sent several chip stocks lower in after-hours action.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:The Big Picture: FANGs Lift Nasdaq To Another High3 Tech Leaders In Buy Range; Skechers Waits For Q4 Shoe To DropAirlines Tumble As United Expansion Signals Price War AheadThis Dow Stock Surges On Strong Earnings, RevenueHow To Invest In The Stock Market Using A Simple Routine

28,QRVO,"Futures for the S&P 500 index edged higher Thursday morning after the major averages rebounded strongly Wednesday.X Apple (AAPL) moved into buy range for the third time in a month after announcing plans to repatriate nearly all of its ""overseas"" cash to the U.S. But volume was just so-so, Apple's relative strength line remains near recent lows, and iPhone chipmakers such as Broadcom (AVGO) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) generally continue to struggle.Meanwhile, chip gear maker ASML Holding (ASML) blasted past a buy point on strong earnings, while collaboration software maker Atlassian (TEAM) moved firmly into a buy zone a day ahead of its quarterly report. Both ASML and Altassian moved in strong volume with encouraging gains in their RS lines, signaling the stocks are outperforming the S&P 500 indexS&P 500 futures climbed 0.15% above fair value. Dow futures rose nearly 0.2% vs. fair value. Nasdaq 100 futures were a fraction above fair value.Apple announced plans to repatriate nearly all its overseas cash to take advantage of tax reform changes. The Dow industrials component will pay $38 billion in taxes, give a $2,500 bonus to employees, and boost its advanced manufacturing investment fund to $5 billion from $1 billion.Shares of Apple erased intraday losses to rally 1.65% to 179.10 in Wednesday's stock market trading, reclaiming a 176.34 flat-base buy point yet again, following one-day moves over that entry on Dec. 18 and Jan. 12. But the same three problems remain that should make investors wary.Volume: Apple's volume rose 12% above normal, which is actually a little better than the prior two moves into a buy zone. But the volume is well below the minimum 40%-50% above-average increase you'd like to see to reflect institutional buying.Relative strength: Apple's RS line — the blue line in the chart below — is near the bottom of its recent consolidation, and Thursday's move didn't mark a big shift. Apple's 1.65% gain wasn't that much better than the S&P 500's 0.9%. Apple's RS line hasn't made much headway since May.IPhone ecosystem: If Apple's prospects are so strong, then why aren't iPhone chipmakers also breaking out, or at least making moves toward doing so? Broadcom is stuck below its 50-day moving average, while Skyworks Solutions and Qorvo (QRVO) are below their 50-day and 200-day lines. All three have lagging RS lines.Can Apple's low-volume, lagging-RS move into buy zone work? Sure, but the odds of big gains are lower, while the risks of failure are higher.The Dutch chip gear maker tried to clear a 186.47 cup-base entry on Tuesday, but with the market reversing lower ASML settled for a 3% rise to 186.38. On Wednesday, ASML gapped higher on a surprise earnings gain and better-than-expected revenue. Shares blasted past the entry point and traded part of the session in the 5% buy zone before closing up 6.9% to 199.18, slightly extended. Investors should look to see if ASML pulls back into the buy zone or, eventually, to its 50-day moving average for an entry point.ASML roared higher on triple normal volume. The stock's RS line moved above a recent consolidation, providing some confirmation of the bullish price action, while approaching the late-November peak.Another reason to be bullish about ASML: Unlike Apple chipmakers, several chip equipment makers made bullish moves and/or news. Ichor Holdings (ICHR) shot up 20% on strong preliminary revenue figures and bullish sales guidance, skyrocketing back above its 50-day line. After the close, Electro Scientific (ESIO) leapt more than 20% on its own bullish guidance, signaling a move toward a buy point.KLA-Tencor (KLAC) reclaimed a buy point in volume that was so-so: 22% above normal. Applied Materials (AMAT) and Lam Research (LRCX) rose strongly as they build the right side of bases.Even if none of these stocks looks as good as ASML, industry-group moves are important for even leading stocks.Atlassian, like ASML, also tried to break out on Tuesday, but closed below a 53.55 cup-base entry. On Wednesday, shares popped 3.9% to 54.87 in volume that was 69% above normal. The RS line is above a very short-term high and is making progress on reaching the highs of the left side of the consolidation.But Atlassian reports earnings on Thursday evening, with investors expecting a 33% EPS gain to 12 cents. Buying or holding a stock into earnings can be risky. Investors may want to consider adopting this earnings options strategy.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:The Big Picture: 5 Signs Why This Rally May Heat Up In 2018RS Line Flashes Different Signals For These Two BreakoutsChip-Gear Stocks Rock On Upbeat ASML, Ichor Reports

Analysts expected $1.43 and $812.6 million.For the current quarter, Qorvo expects to earn an adjusted $1.60 a share on sales of $840 million, based on the midpoint of its guidance. Wall Street was modeling $1.74 and $897 million in the December quarter.Qorvo shares fell 2.5% in after-hours trading on the stock market today.

30,QRVO,"U.S. stock indexes started on a weak note and maintained it near midday Tuesday as semiconductor stocks and Apple dragged the market lower.X The Dow Jones industrial average was just below the break-even line, but the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq retreated 0.1% and 0.4% respectively. The small cap Russell 2000 rose 0.1%.Volume in the stock market today was running lower vs. Friday's preholiday pace.Chips had much to do with Tuesday's weakness. The Philadelphia semiconductor index dropped 1.3%. Three stocks in the Sox skidded 2% or more. They included Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), down 2%; Qorvo (QRVO), off 3%; and Micron Technology (MU), down about 5%.The three chip groups — chipmakers, chip designers and chip equipment makers — are trading 6% to 11% off highs made in November. Chips were leaders throughout most of 2017, but gave back some of their gains beginning in November.Blue chips were up by a 2-1 ratio in the Dow Jones industrial average.

X As you try to find the best stocks to buy and watch, keep a close on eye on relative price strength.This proprietary rating measures technical performance by using a 1 (worst) to 99 (best) score that indicates how a stock's price action over the last 52 weeks compares to the rest of the market. Over 100 years of market history shows that the best-performing stocks often have an RS Rating of over 80 in the early stages of their moves. See if Qorvo can continue to rebound and hit that benchmark. Looking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch? Start HereQorvo broke out earlier, but has fallen back below the prior 81.30 entry from a cup without handle. If a stock you're tracking breaks past a buy point then declines 7% or more below the original entry price, it's considered a failed base. It's best to wait for the stock to form a new consolidation and breakout. Also keep in mind that the most recent pattern is a later-stage base, and such bases are more prone to failure. In terms of fundamentals, the company has posted two quarters of rising earnings growth. Sales growth has also increased over the same time frame. The company holds the No. 12 rank among its peers in the Electronics-Semiconductor Manufacturing industry group. Intel (INTC), Microchip Technology (MCHP) and Microsemi (MSCC) are among the top 5 highly rated stocks within the group.RELATED:Chip Stocks To Watch And Semiconductor Industry NewsWhich Stocks Are Showing Rising Relative Strength?Why Should You Use IBD's Relative Strength Rating?How Relative Strength Line Can Help You Judge A Stock

32,QRVO,"Chipmakers are closing out the seventh week of a rally begun in the first week of May, and they've helped power the Nasdaq to its new highs. The gains have been broad, although some were left behind (Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) and Tower Semiconductors (TSEM)). Others, like Macom Technology Solutions (MTSI), remain deep in long-term corrections.Qorvo (QRVO) broke out on Thursday, but remained below long-term resistance near 86. Switzerland-based STMicroelectronics (STM) cleared a buy point in what was maybe not quite a breakout, but significant because it snapped resistance that had capped STM's progress since November.Multiple attempts to break that resistance made STM's base a bit of a puzzle. Possible buy points occurred at 25.40, 25.22 and, finally, a cup-with-handle buy point at 24.62.STM cleared the 24.62 entry June 5, right after it announced its chips were being used in the Alcatel 3V smartphone, just introduced on the European market by China's TCL Communication.STM is a broad-range chipmaker that counts Apple (AAPL), Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), China's Huawei and Western Digital (WDC) among its more than 1,000 customers.The stock's 4.4% gain on June 4 rode volume that was 51% above its 50-day average, well above the 40% minimum needed to qualify as a breakout.But investors may have been hesitant. The breakout move left shares far below the stock's commanding resistance. And STM had posted gap-up moves past buy points on Jan. 18 and March 21. Both rose only briefly above 25.On June 6, STM took out the 25.22 buy point. Volume was only 27% above average. But the stock had pressed to a new high. After a four-day consolidation, shares broke decisively above both the buy point and the 25 resistance level. Shares on Friday remained well within the chipmaker's buy range, which runs through 26.48.For those who bought at the 24.62 level, the stock is now technically extended.In either case, the base pattern begun in January undercut a prior, two-month base. STM briefly broke out above that base's 24.90 buy point in January. Then it pulled back more than 8% and triggered the automatic sell rule. In fact, it pulled back a total of 19% from its breakout high. That was enough to undercut the two-month base — a move which resets the stock's base count.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseSTM had run up 334% in the 16 months before starting its prior base. So although it was not late stage, a reset gives some assurance that shares are not due for immediate pressure from profit taking.RELATED:As Tesla, GM Rally On EV, Self-Driving Hopes These Stocks May Be NextChip Stocks On The Rise: ASML, STMicro, OthersThese 3 Top Stocks Had Strong Moves Into Buy Zones TodayPain For All?

33,QRVO,"Micron Technology (MU) on Thursday said a China court injunction to halt sales of some of its memory chips in the country would impact ""slightly more than 1%"" of the company's annual revenue, causing shares to rise.The statement appeased many investors who bought shares in response. Micron stock fell 5.5% on Tuesday after Taiwanese rival United Microelectronics (UMC) announced that it won a patent-infringement lawsuit against Micron in China.On Thursday, though, Micron shares climbed 2.6% to 52.84 on the stock market today.The Fuzhou Intermediate People's Court in Fujian province, China, imposed a preliminary injunction against Micron's subsidiaries in the country. That came after the court sided with UMC and its Chinese partner Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit. The injunction enjoins Micron from manufacturing, selling or importing certain Crucial and Ballistix-branded DRAM modules and solid-state drives in China.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe affected products make up slightly more than 1% of Micron's annual revenue, the Boise, Idaho-based company said in a news release. Micron reiterated its previous revenue guidance for the current quarter of $8 billion to $8.4 billion. The company said it will comply with the ruling while requesting the Fuzhou court to reconsider or stay its decision.""Micron is disappointed with the ruling by the Fuzhou Intermediate People's Court,"" Micron General Counsel Joel Poppen said in a prepared statement. ""We strongly believe that the patents are invalid and that Micron's products do not infringe the patents.""The Fuzhou court issued the preliminary ruling before allowing Micron a chance to present its defense, Poppen said. The court did not provide a fair hearing to Micron, he added.UMC and Jinhua filed their patent-infringement claims against Micron in retaliation for criminal indictments filed by Taiwan authorities against UMC and three of its employees. The claims also came in response to Micron's lawsuit against UMC and Jinhua in the U.S. District Court in California's Northern District. Micron claimed its trade secrets were misappropriated by the two companies.China might restrict Micron from participating in that country's market, says BMO Capital Markets analyst Ambrish Srivastava. It could prevent Micron from competing effectively with Chinese semiconductor companies, he says.""We do not believe the ambitions of China in semis are limited to memory, but that is certainly an area that a lot of investment is being directed at,"" Srivastava said in a report Thursday.Srivastava rates Micron stock as market perform with a price target of 63.FBN Securities analyst Shebly Seyrafi said Tuesday's pullback in Micron stock was unjustified. He reiterated his outperform rating on Micron stock with a price target of 80.RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani concurred. He maintained his outperform rating with a price target of 83 for Micron.""While China accounts for about 51% of Micron's total revenue, these specific products constitute slightly more than 1% of Micron's total revenue,"" he said. ""While we expect the stock to react positively to the minimal impact arising from these injunctions, we think it highlights the risks from ongoing U.S.-China trade tensions to the industry.""Elsewhere in semiconductor stocks, KeyBanc Capital Markets on Thursday upgraded chipmaker Qorvo (QRVO) to the equivalent of a buy rating. The firm also raised its price targets on two other chip stocks and cut its target on another.

35,QRVO,"Stock futures edged higher early Wednesday morning after Democrat Doug Jones won Alabama's special election Tuesday, reducing the GOP's already-narrow Senate majority. Meanwhile, investors are looking ahead to the Federal Reserve's 2018 outlook and an expected interest-rate hike Wednesday afternoon.X Alabama is normally a deep-red state, but accusations of sexual misconduct involving teens hurt Republican Roy Moore.Tuesday's vote will complicate President Trump's agenda by cutting the GOP Senate majority to just 51-49. However, Jones likely won't take office for a few weeks, giving Republicans some time to pass tax cuts with the current 52-48 split.Details of the evolving GOP tax-cut plan appeared after Tuesday's close. Meanwhile, the Fed is virtually assured of raising rates at 2 p.m. ET, but the question is how many hikes that policymakers will forecast for 2018.S&P 500 index futures rose 0.1% vs. fair value after briefly falling following the Alabama election results. Dow and Nasdaq 100 futures advanced about 0.15%.Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) is close to carving out a flat base. But Apple chip plays are not faring as well, with Broadcom (AVGO) undercutting its buy point Tuesday, joining Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), Applied Materials (AMAT), Analog Devices (ADI) and Qorvo (QRVO) below the 50-day line as chipmakers continue to slump.The GOP tax plan being hashed out between the House and Senate now has a 21% corporate tax cut, down from the current 35%, but up from prior  plans for 20%. There would be a 37% personal income rate and the mortgage interest deduction would  be capped at $750,000, down from the current $1 million but above the House's $500,000.Apple shares fell 0.6% to 171.70 in Tuesday's stock market trading, but they're still holding support slightly above the 50-day moving average.Apple appears to be headed toward a flat base, which needs a minimum of five weeks. That would occur at the end of this week. This hypothetical bullish consolidation, with a potential buy point of 176.34, would be a base-on-base formation above a prior cup-with-handle pattern.Apple is investing $390 million in Finisar (FNSR) to help the optical components maker revamp a Texas plant to make key iPhone chips. Finisar shot up in premarket trading on Wednesday's news.Apple, a member of the Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow industrials, has shaken off iPhone X supply concerns.But such worries may be affecting key iPhone-related chip plays, which are also struggling due to general weakness in semiconductors.Broadcom had been one of the stronger Apple chipmakers, holding above its 259.46 buy point for the most part since the late-October breakout, becoming somewhat extended in late November.Broadcom, which is mounting a now-hostile bid for fellow wireless-chip giant Qualcomm (QCOM), reported strong earnings and guidance as well as a big dividend hike last week.Shares popped intraday Dec. 7 on the report, but closed flat. In the last three sessions, shares tested their buy point and 50-day moving average, finally closing below both levels with Tuesday's 0.4% loss to 258.81.Because Broadcom wiped out a 10% gain from its buy point, that entry is now invalid. A strong, high-volume retaking of the 50-day line could present a new buying opportunity.The chip-equipment giant is not a direct Apple supplier, though it's been deemed an iPhone X play for its work with OLED screens.Applied Materials fell 2.2% to 50.47 on Tuesday, continuing to hold below its 50-day moving average.In fact, just one of the 22 largest chip-gear stocks by market cap is current above that key support line, Kulicke & Soffa (KLIC). That's despite the record chip-gear sales in 2017 and 2018 seen by industry group SEMI.Among top chipmakers, Intel (INTC) and Texas Instruments (TXN) are slightly above their 50-day lines, but not many others are, outside of M&A-related plays.Analog Devices successfully broke out in late September/early October, unlike many other Apple suppliers. Shares rose more than 9% above an 85.81 buy point by Nov. 20. But shares then reversed lower on the company's latest earnings report and soon undercut their 50-day line.In recent sessions, Analog Devices has been holding just above or below the 85.81 entry, which is technically still valid. Shares fell 0.4% to 85.48 on Tuesday.Skyworks broke out in late October and Qorvo in early November, with both rising for a few sessions but then quickly tumbling through their buy points and 50-day lines.Skyworks fell 0.5% to 96.47 on Tuesday, about 18% off its high.

Analysts predict an 8% per-share profit gain to 53 cents, with sales dipping 1% to $255 million. But Lumentum's outlook and commentary about 3D sensor demand may be more important.Shares reversed lower to close down 2.5% to 63.17 on Tuesday, but that's after running up nearly 16% from Oct. 20 to Oct. 30. Lumentum has a potential cup-base buy point of 68.73.The chipmaker reports after the market close Wednesday. Analysts expect a 12% EPS gain to $1.44, with revenue declining for a second straight quarter, off 6% to $811 million. Qorvo has a cup-with-handle buy point of 76.57. For a second straight session, Qorvo crossed that entry intraday, but closed below it, falling 0.6% to 75.81 on Tuesday.Even if Lumentum and Qorvo have good results and guidance and stocks acted well, there's still the little issue of Apple's earnings out late Thursday. The iPhone X officially goes on sale Friday, which means there will be teardowns that reveal which Apple suppliers are winners and losers.Meanwhile, Broadcom and Skyworks extended Monday's breakouts, but are still in buy range.Universal Display, which makes key technology for OLED screens, rose 5.7% on Tuesday to 146.50, clearing a 145.40 entry. Universal Display is not a direct Apple supplier, but the iPhone X does use an OLED screen. Samsung Electronics said Tuesday that OLED demand is strong, while initial iPhone X reviews were positive.Universal Display reports earnings on Thursday, Skyworks is out Nov. 6, while Broadcom is several weeks away.Apple rose 1.4% to 169.04 on Tuesday, just beyond the 5% chase zone from a 160.97 entry cleared Friday.RELATED:The Big Picture: Indexes Cap October With Halloween TreatUniversal Display Breaks Out After Samsung Earnings ReportApple Gets Price-Target Hike After Notching Record HighElectronic Arts Guides To Holiday Sales Below Views

The company's guidance was disappointing, but its long-term demand drivers remain unchanged, he said in a report.Qorvo's shortfall in the December-quarter was likely related to major customer Apple (AAPL), which has been slow to ramp up production of its flagship iPhone X.""The revenue outlook for the December-quarter came in $50 million below sell-side expectations on headwinds from Apple,"" he said. ""What is perplexing to us, however, is that the $50 million in lower revenue for the December quarter is not coming back in the March quarter — certainly not to the extent we (and others) had hoped given an improving backdrop for China, Huawei share gains and our view that iPhone demand is not perishable and any delay in builds should simply shift into the March quarter.""Ackerman reiterated his market-perform rating on Qorvo and cut his price target to 80 from 85.Greensboro, N.C.-based Qorvo makes radio-frequency chips for mobile devices, communications infrastructure and aerospace and defense applications. Qorvo gets about 35% of its sales from Apple.IBD'S TAKE: The IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks includes seven chip-industry players.Elsewhere in the chip sector Thursday, Qualcomm (QCOM) received several price-target increases to its stock after its earnings report late Wednesday, while Impinj (PI) was smacked with a downgrade and a several price-target cuts following its earnings report.Qualcomm stock closed 2.6% higher to 54.84.

So will Apple suppliers follow the iPhone maker this time?IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter. IBD discussed how to use call options for Apple in the latest Earnings Preview column.Broadcom is in a flat base with a buy point of 259.46. The chipmaker tried to break out in late July and late August, but those quickly faltered. On Friday, the stock rose 3.7% to 252.87, rebounding above its 50-day moving average in strong volume.Broadcom won't report its latest earnings for several weeks.Lumentum is a fiber-optic components maker. But it's also a presumed supplier of 3D sensors for the Apple iPhone X. The iPhone X uses 3D sensors for a facial recognition app that unlocks screens.The company reports fiscal first-quarter earnings before the market open on Wednesday, Nov. 1. Analysts predict an 8% per-share profit gain to 53 cents, with sales dipping 1% to $255 million. But investors may be more interested in Lumentum's outlook and the prospects for a big rise in demand related to the Apple iPhone X, even if that's not specifically cited.Lumentum shares are in a cup base with a current potential buy point of 68.73. The stock spiked nearly 12% to 62.60, rebounding from its 50-day line, amid signs that Lumentum may get a big benefit from Apple.Universal Display supplies OLED technology and materials. OLED screens are in the iPhone X and some other high-end smartphones from Samsung and others.Universal Display reports after the market close on Thursday, Nov. 2. Wall Street expects EPS of 12 cents, reversing a year-earlier loss of 3 cents a share. Sales are seen rising 56% to $47.1 million in the September quarter.Universal Display, a member of the IBD 50 index, is in a flat base-on-base with a 145.40 buy point.The current consolidation is just above a double-bottom pattern. Universal Display cleared that 127.88 buy point in early September, moving to 145.30 in a couple of weeks. But then the stock reversed, erasing a near-14% gain and then some. When a stock wipes out a gain of 10% or more from the buy point, the breakout has failed.Skyworks Solutions is an Apple iPhone chipmaker like Broadcom and Qorvo. Skyworks tried to clear a 108.65 cup-with-handle base a couple of times in September, but the stock eventually fell sharply, making that entry invalid.Since then, Skyworks has been consolidating in a flat base, with a conventional buy point of 110.71. Aggressive investors could see 107.92 as an alternative entry. Skyworks rose as high as 108.37 on Friday, closing up 2.3% to 107.91 in above-average volume.Skyworks will report its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings on Nov. 6. Wall Street expects a 19% gain to $1.75 a share, with sales up 17.5% to $981 million.Qorvo will report earnings on Wednesday, Nov. 1, after the market close. Analysts expect a 12% EPS gain to $1.44, with revenue declining for a second straight quarter, down 6% to $811 million.Qorvo is in a cup-with-handle base with a 76.57 buy point. The stock rose 5.4% to 73.72 last week, rebounding over its 10-week line in above-average volume.RELATED:Options Trading: How To Play Apple, Facebook EarningsApple Shows Long Delivery Delays For iPhone X PreordersLumentum Lights Up As AMS Earnings Show Big Gains From AppleTech Favorites To Face Investors, Congress: Investing Action Plan

74,QRVO,"Apple (AAPL) plans to shake up its chip suppliers with its next-generation iPhones, a Wall Street firm said Monday.X Nomura Instinet predicted that Apple will switch from Qualcomm (QCOM) to Intel (INTC) for the cellular modem in its new handsets, expected to be released this fall. Apple is locked in a bitter legal fight with Qualcomm over royalties and patent licensing terms.KGI Securities also said Monday that Apple will dump Qualcomm and rely exclusively on Intel for modem chips, 9to5Mac reported.Nomura also thinks Apple will switch from Broadcom (AVGO) to Qorvo (QRVO) for a mid-/high-band power amplifier duplexer for at least one model of its new handsets.Plus, Nomura believes Apple will switch from Broadcom to STMicroelectronics (STM) for wireless charging in its 12th-generation handsets.""These changes are not insignificant and in our view reflect an effort to reduce iPhone bill of materials,"" Nomura analyst Romit Shah said in a report.IBD'S TAKE: For the latest news on chip stocks, visit IBD's news page Chip Stocks To Watch And Semiconductor Industry News.Evidence is mounting that many consumers are balking at the higher prices Apple charged with its 11th-generation smartphones, the iPhone X and iPhone 8 series, Shah said. Apple hopes to reduce its production costs for the next-generation iPhones so it can lower their retail pricing.Apple's choice of Qorvo for high-frequency filtering technology ""is one of several instances whereby Apple is seemingly moving from 'best available' to 'good enough' to maintain an iPhone standard of functionality,"" Shah said.The same holds true for Apple's use of Intel's modem over Qualcomm's offering, he said.Broadcom shares fell 3.1% to 228.10 amid a broad sell-off on the stock market today. Qualcomm tumbled 6.6% to 61.73. Both also were reacting to Broadcom's raised offer to buy Qualcomm.Intel shares dropped 3.5% to 44.52. Qorvo stock crumbled 6.4% to 75.58.

75,QRVO,"Apple (AAPL) fought to hold above its 200-day moving average, but by the close had retreated below the key level as the major averages crashed on the stock market today. The 200-day line is a last-ditch support area for growth stocks. Quickly regaining that level would be good news for long-term investors in the iPhone maker.X Apple already plunged more than 6% last week, capped by Friday's 4.3% tumble after the tech titan reported weaker-than-expected iPhone shipments and guided low on current-quarter revenue. Apple, a member of the S&P 500 index, Nasdaq composite and Dow Jones industrial average. That stock has triggered four sell signals in the past two weeks, at least for recent Apple investors.These sell signals were all the more glaring because Apple gave such weak buy signals. The stock cleared a 176.34 buy point in three different periods. The moves were generally modest with unimpressive volume. Also, the relative strength line, which tracks the stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, continued to trend lower.Meanwhile, iPhone-related stocks, including Broadcom (AVGO), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), Universal Display (OLED) and Applied Materials (AMAT) have shown weak chart action as well. More on those later.Here are the four sell signals for Apple.Apple fell below its 176.34 entry on Jan. 24, sinking 1.6% to 174.22 in its heaviest volume since Nov. 3. The RS line, the blue line in the chart below, fell to the lowest levels of the consolidation. But the stock did find support at its 50-day moving average.The next day, Jan. 25, Apple retreated below its 50-day moving average, again in above-average trade. The 50-day line is the red line in the chart below. That capped a 3.9% weekly decline as the RS line fell to its worst levels since July. Apple shares kept falling for the next few sessions, pushing the RS line to mid-June lows.Just ahead of Apple's Thursday night earnings report, Apple bulls could still talk themselves into believing that expectations of lowered guidance were already priced in. And in after-hours trading Thursday, Apple shares did rally, even hinting at a move back to the 50-day moving average.But on Friday Apple fell 4.3% to 160.50 — 9% below the 176.34 entry. When a stock falls 7%-8% below a buy point, it's an automatic sell for recent investors.Friday's move triggered yet another sell signal, this one for the Oct. 27 breakout from a cup-with-handle base. The stock ran up nearly 12% from that 160.97 buy point and then round-tripped. You never want to see a 10% gain go to zero.So if you bought Apple from the October or January breakouts, there were definite reasons to sell.While not sell signals for Apple, the action of many iPhone-related stocks gave wavering Apple investors additional reasons to take profits or cut losses.Chipmakers with heavy Apple exposure fared even worse than their big customer, falling with other semiconductors in December and continuing to slump in January. Broadcom, Skyworks Solutions and Qorvo (QRVO) hit multi-month lows while their RS lines hit 52-week lows. Broadcom gave bullish preliminary revenue and guidance last week, but the share gains were muted. Qorvo did roar back last week, despite slashing guidance late Wednesday, providing some hope that the bad news was priced in for the Apple ecosystem. But much of Qorvo's gain stemmed from a big new iPhone contract win.Qorvo lost 6.4% on Monday.Applied Materials is a chip-gear giant that also makes equipment for producing OLED screens. OLED screens are used on the iPhone X and other high-end smartphones and displays. Applied Materials came pennies from a cup-with-handle buy point on Jan. 25, but reversed lower. Last Tuesday, shares fell below their 50-day moving average. On Friday, shares slid 4.9%.On Monday, shares sank 4.7%, undercutting their 200-day line.Universal Display, which makes technology for OLED displays, broke out on Jan. 8, though the RS line was lagging somewhat. Shares rose solidly over the next two weeks, but reversed sharply lower after a Jan. 19 peak. On Jan. 23, Universal Display fell below its buy point. On Jan. 24, the day Apple undercut its buy point for the last time, Universal Display tumbled through its 50-day line, dropping as much as 10% below the entry point, making it invalid.Shares have continued to slide, falling 5.9% on Monday. They've erased most of the gains from a short base-on-base buy point initially cleared on Oct. 31.If you bought Apple at the January 2017 breakout from a 118.12 cup-with-handle breakout, you're still sitting on a big gain. There's no glaring sell signal. But the reasons for holding the stock have become less compelling. Since late February, Apple has merely matched the S&P 500 index, with clear underperformance for the past three months.Apple fell to 158 soon after Monday's open, undercutting its 200-day moving average for the first time since July 2016. Shares rebounded as high as 163.88 but then succumbed to the broader market. Shares closed down 2.5% to 156.49 in more than double normal volume.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Stocks Fall Broadly; Is A True Correction Near?IPhone Chip Suppliers Pressured By Apple's Quarterly ReportDid You See The Big Flaws In These IBD 50 Stocks' Charts?Anatomy Of A Chart: Breaking Down The Buy And Sell ZonesIs It Time To Get Into - Or Out Of - The Stock Market?

76,QRVO,"With the S&P 500 index, Nasdaq composite and Dow industrials suffering their worst weekly losses in two years, it's not surprising that top-rated growth stocks retreated. Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), Apple (AAPL) supplier Qorvo (QRVO), Atlassian (TEAM), IPG Photonics (IPGP), Paylocity (PCTY) and Cypress Semiconductor (CY) all broke out recently, but in the past week or so have slipped modestly below buy points.X These stocks are worth keeping on watch lists, in case they retake their buy points, preferably with robust price gains and in strong volume. Keep in mind that the market uptrend is under pressure. Investors should be cautious about new purchases, quick to cut losses and may want to consider taking some profits in winning stocks.But with futures selling off hard once again, it's likely that many of these stock futures will come under further pressure at the open.Vertex Pharmaceuticals cleared a 167.95 buy point in late January, closing above that level on Jan. 26, but in below-average volume. Shares of the biotech dipped just below the entry. They retook the buy point on Feb. 1 with a 3.7% jump in strong volume.

On Friday, shares fell 1% to 52.72 in light volume.Atlassian shares fell 2.3% to 51.53 in morning trade Monday.The RS line is lagging, but not much.

86,QRVO,"Disappointing sales of the iPhone X could lead Apple (AAPL) to end production of its flagship handset this summer as it prepares to replace it with a trio of new smartphones in the fall, Wall Street analysts said Friday.X KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicted that the iPhone X will reach ""end of life"" in the summer and will not be retained as a lower-cost option when the new iPhones are released. If that is the case, it would mark the first time that Apple has not retained the previous year's model in its smartphone lineup, AppleInsider reported.Instead, the technologies in the iPhone X would be migrated to the 12th-generation handsets, which are likely to be introduced in September.Sales of the iPhone X have been disappointing, leading to a reduction of orders with contract manufacturers, KGI said.Rosenblatt Securities analyst Jun Zhang also sees Apple discontinuing production of the iPhone X this summer.""Based on our most current research, we believe that Apple may be planning to cut iPhone X production for the June quarter by as much as 10 million units, reducing output to 15 million,"" Zhang said in a note to clients. ""This move drives our latest view that Apple could be planning to stop iPhone X production midyear to ramp up for the various models of the coming Xs.""The iPhone X was billed as Apple's 10th-anniversary handset.

The unemployment rate ticked down to 4.3% while average hourly wages rose a solid 0.3%. The report is more evidence of tighter labor markets, though it likely won't shift the Federal Reserve's policy path in the near future. Meanwhile, ISM surveys signaled still-strong manufacturing growth while some decelerating growth in the service sector.Grubhub (GRUB) and Yelp (Yelp) both topped second-quarter earnings and revenue estimates late Thursday. As part of a long-term partnership, Grubhub will pay $287.5 million in cash to acquire Yelp's online food ordering and delivery business, Eat24.

Aetna (AET) and Humana (HUM), which will both complete their exit from the individual insurance markets at year end, both sailed past earnings estimates thanks to momentum in their Medicare Advantage businesses, and their shares vaulted to record highs. Aetna earnings ballooned by 55% and Humana earnings grew 6%, both smashing views. Cigna (CI) and WellCare Health Plans (WCG) also reported strong earnings. But Molina Healthcare (MOH), which saw the exchanges as a big growth opportunity, reported a loss of $4.10 a share in Q2, largely blaming its ObamaCare exchange business. Molina will pull out of the Wisconsin and Utah markets and scale back its presence in Washington state. In its remaining markets, Molina said it will hike premiums at least 30% in 2018. Molina shares tumbled.RELATED:Aetna Trounces Expectations As Big ObamaCare Insurer CrashesVulcan Materials (VMC) and Martin Marietta Materials (MLM), huge suppliers of construction aggregates, both reported earnings below views.

94,QRVO,"Stock futures rose modestly Monday morning vs. fair value, suggesting continued momentum heading into this week's Federal Reserve policy meeting after the S&P 500, Nasdaq and Dow industrials all hit record highs on Friday.XApple (AAPL) broke out to a buy point in early August, but key iPhone chip suppliers struggled to break out. On Friday, Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Texas Instruments (TXN) surged past entry points. Keep a close eye on fellow Broadcom (AVGO), Qorvo (QRVO) and Applied Materials (AMAT), as well as giant Intel (INTC), which are approaching buy zones.Meanwhile, Northrop Grumman (NOC) reached a $9.2 billion deal to buy aerospace and defense firm Orbital ATK (OA).Looking ahead, the Federal Reserve will hold a policy meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday, with wide expectations that the central bank will begin to pare its massive balance sheet.

Nasdaq 100 futures also advanced 0.2% Dow futures climbed 0.25%.Asian markets rallied Monday as North Korean tensions receded, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng up 1.3%. European bourses rose modestly intraday.Several chip stocks broke out in Friday stock market trading, including a pair of iPhone chip stocks clearing cup-with-handle buy points in strong volume. That's notable because Apple suppliers had been building sound bases, sometimes flirting with buys, but not really joining their key customer in the buy zone. That raised some doubts about Apple's own breakout, especially with the stock moving sideways for several weeks.Skyworks, which briefly topped a 108.65 buy point intraday on Sept. 5, advanced 2.3% to close at 109.55. Texas Instruments rose 1.8% to 84.78, above an 84.34 entry and hitting a 17-year high.Are these just brief forays into buy zones or the start of a broad advance? One sign will be whether other iPhone chip plays follow suit.Broadcom briefly topped a buy point in late July but then reversed, falling sufficiently to make the old entry point invalid. Broadcom has since formed a new flat base with a 258.59 buy point. Broadcom tested that entry point late last month as the flat base was forming, but didn't close above it. Shares climbed 1.5% on Friday to 250.55, moving back above it 50-day moving average.Qorvo is in a cup base, and just completed a handle, giving it a lower entry point of 75.81. Qorvo jumped 2.7% to 75.49 on Friday, just below that entry.Applied Materials is a chip- and design-equipment giant. It's not a direct iPhone supplier. But some analysts have pegged it as an iPhone play, citing its OLED-related operations. The Apple iPhone X will boast an OLED screen, which is already being used by Samsung on some handsets.Applied Materials tried to break out of a cup-with-handle base on Friday, rising to just hit the 47.69 buy point. But shares pulled back, closing up 0.2% at 47.14.Intel has become a recent supplier of iPhone chips, though you wouldn't want to call the world's largest semiconductor maker an ""Apple play."" But you can say that Intel is near a buy point. Intel surged 5% last week to 36.96, just 2% below a 37.60 double-bottom base. Intel's Relative Strength line has been lagging in 2017 and really for the last several years, reflecting the stock's underperformance vs. the S&P 500 index.For its part Apple rose 1% to 159.88 on Friday, finding support near its 10-week line. That snapped a three-day mild decline following mild disappointment over the late release date for iPhone X. Apple remains in range from a 156.75 flat-base entry.Apple iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus preorders began on Friday. While the tech giant may not indicate how those orders went, big wireless operators, electronics retailers and analysts may give their own estimates of demand.

95,QRVO,"Apple's (AAPL) 11th-generation smartphones could provide a lift for several chip companies, Wall Street analysts said Wednesday.Broadcom (AVGO), Cypress Semiconductor (CY) and Integrated Device Technology (IDTI) are among the chipmakers expected to benefit from the launch this fall of Apple's iPhone X and iPhone 8 series smartphones, which were unveiled Tuesday. The iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus handsets are scheduled for release on Sept. 22, while the iPhone X (pronounced ""ten"") is due out on Nov. 3.Broadcom is the biggest direct beneficiary of the new Apple handsets, KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst John Vinh said in a report.""We view the launch of the new iPhones as most positive for Broadcom with (its) content expected to increase 40% and with the number of chips increasing to eight from five,"" Vinh said. ""We believe the three additional chips will be needed for 3D touch, wireless charging, and RF (radio frequency).""Other chipmakers likely to increase their content in the new iPhones include Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Qorvo (QRVO).Skyworks is seen making double-digit content gains in the new iPhones, while Qorvo makes single-digit gains, Vinh said.IBD'S TAKE: The IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks now includes seven chip industry players, including Skyworks Solutions.Cypress Semi is likely to get a boost from Apple's use of fast-charging technology in its new iPhones.""We view the enablement of fast charging in the new iPhones as positive for Cypress, as we anticipate content of 30 to 40 cents in each of the new iPhones,"" Vinh said. ""We currently do not anticipate the iPhones will ship with the fast-charging cable and block in the box, as these will be add-on accessories.""While the new iPhones likely have wireless-charging chips supplied by Broadcom, rival Integrated Device Technology is seen as benefiting from the overall smartphone industry adoption of wireless charging.IDT already has secured design wins from Chinese smartphone makers, who are predicted to follow Apple in adding wireless charging to their devices, Vinh said.Needham analyst Quinn Bolton concurred that IDT will be an indirect beneficiary of Apple's adoption of wireless charging.""We view Apple's support of Qi wireless charging as a significant positive for the inductive wireless charging ecosystem and we believe inductive wireless charging will likely become a check-box feature in most new premium smartphone platforms,"" Bolton said. ""As IDT is the undisputed market share leader in inductive wireless power, we expect IDT to capture a meaningful percentage of this 'fast-follower' business.""Of the bunch, IDT was the biggest winner on the stock market today.IDT shares broke out of a cup base with a buy point of 27.19, and jumped more than 6% at one point.

96,QRVO,"One characteristic of the current stock market is the number of stocks forming shallow consolidations.This is a good sign because it suggests that sellers aren't able to drive a stock very far south without bringing in buyers.Two stocks posting new highs Tuesday fit that description.Chipmaker Qorvo (QRVO) cleared a 72.52 buy point in a base-on-base pattern during Tuesday's session, closing at 74.84. The base's depth was less than 10%. Volume was strong.A base-on-base pattern is partly defined by the previous pattern. Notice how the low in the current pattern stopped just above the high of the previous base. This is characteristic of a base on base.Qorvo broke out of the previous base Feb. 1, popping above a 64.90 buy point. The stock gained almost 12% before retreating and starting work on the current consolidation. Because the gain did not reach 20%, the base count remains second stage.Qorvo's quarterly earnings have been lumpy (0%, 6%, 31% and down 18%), but the Street expects earnings in fiscal 2018 ending in March to rise 18%.The midcap company has some concentration in revenue. Although that adds risk, it isn't necessarily a bad thing. In fiscal 2016, one customer accounted for about 37% of revenue. The customer is widely believed to be Apple (AAPL).The concentration could grow in the second half of this year, according to Qorvo. ""We expect to expand our dollar content at our largest customer later this year,"" said CEO Robert Bruggeworth at the earnings call May 4.SS&C Technologies (SSNC) has been trying to clear and hold above a 37.58 buy point in a 12% deep flat base. Volume was heavy Tuesday as the stock crossed above the entry. The stock closed still in buy range at 37.71.The company provides software to the financial services industry.SS&C has a Composite Rating of 94. The Composite Rating combines all five IBD ratings into a single number. A 94 means the stock is in the top sixth percentile.On Tuesday, homebuilders got some discouraging news. Housing starts and permits for April came in lower than expected. The homebuilder group, which among 197 industry groups was No. 5 going into Tuesday's session, shook off the bad news and rose 0.8%, according to preliminary data.Within the group, Toll Brothers (TOL) crawled above an eight-week, 6% deep consolidation.

Microchip rose 0.5% to 78.76.IBD'S TAKE: For the latest news on chip stocks, visit IBD's news page Chip Stocks To Watch And Semiconductor Industry News.Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill increased his price target on Nvidia stock on expectations that the company's recent deal with Toyota Motor (TM) will generate ""meaningful revenue over the next 24 months.""Toyota is using Nvidia chip sets for advanced driver assistance systems and eventually self-driving cars.Gill estimates that the Toyota deal could generate an incremental $1 billion to $1.7 billion in revenue and 35 to 65 cents in earnings per share over 2.5 years.Jefferies analyst Mark Lipacis sees Nvidia as a ""key beneficiary of the 4th Tectonic Shift in Computing"" because it supplies systems for deep learning applications.""Nvidia's decadelong investment in CUDA, its proprietary GPU-processing language has resulted in a multiyear competitive advantage, that has yet to be fully appreciated by investors,"" Lipacis said in a note to clients. Nvidia is a leader in graphics processing units, or GPUs.Previous shifts in computing included the move from mainframes to minicomputers, minicomputers to PCs, and PCs to mobile phones and data centers. The latest shift is to parallel processing, artificial intelligence and the internet of things, Lipacis said.In addition to Nvidia, other chipmakers likely to benefit from the growth of parallel processing include Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Cavium (CAVM) and Xilinx (XLNX), he said.Lipacis upgraded Cavium and Xilinx to buy from hold. He raised his price target on Cavium to 79 from 73 and upped his price target on Xilinx to 77 from 68.Likely beneficiaries of the internet-of-things trend include Analog Devices (ADI), Microchip Technology, Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM) and Texas Instruments (TXN).Intel (INTC) has ""the most to lose"" in the shift from traditional data centers to parallel processing and internet of things. As such, Lipacis downgraded Intel stock to underperform from hold and slashed his price target to 29 from 38.Intel dropped 0.7% to 33.65 on Monday.Mizuho Securities analyst Vijay Rakesh updated his ratings on a host of semiconductor stocks on Monday.He raised his price targets on AMD, Microchip, Texas Instruments and Xilinx, but cut his target on Qorvo (QRVO).Rakesh reiterated his buy rating on AMD and upped his price target to 15 from 14. AMD is seen benefiting from second-half 2017 game console sales and improved demand for PCs and graphics processors.Microchip is continuing to see strong orders from automotive and industrial markets, Rakesh said.Texas Instruments also is benefiting from growth in the automotive and industrial markets. Rakesh rates TI as neutral, but upped his price target to 82 from 78.Xilinx is seeing opportunities in automotive and 5G wireless deployments, but trades at a premium multiple, Rakesh said. He rates Xilinx as neutral, but raised his price target to 68 from 64.Qorvo is likely to be impacted by near-term weakness in the China mobile phone market and faces high expectations for wireless revenue in the September quarter.

101,QRVO,"Futures for the S&P 500, Nasdaq 100 and Dow Jones industrial averages were heading lower early Thursday morning. On Wednesday, chip stocks fueled the Nasdaq composite's 0.7% rally, on strong industry growth figures. But shares of Apple (AAPL) iPhone chip suppliers such as Broadcom (AVGO), Texas Instruments (TXN), Analog Devices (ADI), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Qorvo (QRVO) are all still below key support levels after significant sell-offs.XNasdaq 100 futures fell 0.6% vs. fair value, while S&P 500 futures sank 0.4%. Dow futures were off 0.25%.In Asian trading, Japan's Nikkei fell 0.4% and China's Shanghai composite rose 0.2%. In Europe intraday, the U.K.'s FTSE fell 0.7%, Germany's Dax 0.8% and France's CAC-40 1%.Apple shares themselves aren't acting that badly. The iPhone maker tumbled with other leading techs on June 9, then fell through its 50-day moving average on June 10. But since then the stock has moved sideways. Technically, Apple is in a flat base with a potential 156.75 buy point, though it needs to get above its 50-day line before investors should pay close attention.Apple's influence on the market is hard to overstate. Not only is the world's most valuable company by market cap and a member of the three major indexes, but its business strongly influences a raft of other companies, notably iPhone chip suppliers. Those chip stocks have been showing technical weakness, which one up session can't repair. Let's take a look at Broadcom, Texas Instruments, Analog Devices, Skyworks Solutions and Qorvo.Broadcom is one of the better-looking iPhone chip stocks. Shares began pulling back with other techs on June 9, but held above its 50-day moving average until finally losing that support last week. On Monday, shares fell intraday to 229.08, almost roundtripping a near-13% gain from a 227.85 buy point cleared in early May.Texas Instruments tumbled hard on June 9, losing a buy point. That started a test of the 50-day over several sessions, with shares closing below that level for good on June 20. Since then shares have continued to trend lower. On Wednesday, TI rose 0.85% after finding some support at the 200-day line.Analog Devices' woes started a little earlier that most techs. Analog Devices broke out on May 30, closing just above the 84.34 buy point. The next morning Analog Devices skyrocketed intraday to 90.49, but closed up only 1.1% at 85.76. On June 1, shares tumbled below the entry area, followed by undercutting the 50-day line two sessions later. Analog traded above and below the 50-day for several weeks before starting a new leg down on June 27. Shares rose 2.1% on Wednesday, trading between the 50-day and 200-day lines.Skyworks was well extended from any buy zone on June 9, nearly hitting an all-time high, when shares quickly reversed. Skyworks closed below its 50-day line for good on June 23, then kept heading lower. Skyworks rose 2.3% on Wednesday, but is still more than 5% below its 50-day.Qorvo is trying to find support at its 200-day line after a sharp June sell-off that took the chip stock below its 50-day line and a buy point. Shares rose 3.1% on Wednesday.RELATED:The Big Picture: Why The Sloppy Second-Half Start For StocksChip Stocks Jump As Industry Sees Strongest Growth In 7 YearsApple iPhone Demand Soft, But That's OK, Analyst ContendsQ2 Earnings Preview: Stocks Expecting 50%-Plus Growth

They all have Composite Ratings of at least 95 and are reporting earnings this coming week.Many big stock market winners have had 95+ CRs at the start of their big price moves.The Composite Rating, which goes from 1 to a best-possible 99, is an overall score for a stock that combine other proprietary IBD ratings of fundamental and technical factors. You should never buy a stock simply on ratings. But let's take a look of these five stocks, some of which are close to buy ratings.(Apple also is reporting on Tuesday. Apple has an 80 Composite Rating, reflecting its three-quarter string of declining earnings before a slim gain in its prior quarter. Analysts expect another modest rise in Tuesday's report. But the stock has been the top performer on the Dow Jones industrial average, and is still in buy range from a 141.12 three-weeks-tight pattern. Investors are looking ahead to the iPhone 8 later this year to reignite growth. Many also are hoping for Apple to return more of its huge cash hoard.)Facebook, which reports Wednesday, has a 96 Composite Rating.The stock had risen 29% in 2017 as of Friday.Facebook rose 1.5% to 152.46 on the stock market today, hitting a record high for a fifth straight session. The stock is well extended from any proper buy point.The social networking giant seems to have dealt with upstart Snapchat by cloning many of the Snap (SNAP) unit's most popular features, especially via Facebook's Instagram. Instagram recently topped 700 million users.Analysts expect Facebook to report 45% gains in earnings per share and revenue. That would actually represent the third straight quarter of decelerating growth for both, but it's excellent growth for so a large company with such stellar year-earlier comparisons.Qorvo, which reports Wednesday, has a 96 Composite Rating. It makes radio frequency chips used in the Apple iPhone and other wireless devices.Apple cleared a 64.90 buy point in early February, and didn't clear the 5% chase zone until early April. But Qorvo sank 4.35% to 68.03 on Friday, in more than double normal volume. Technically, the stock is just in buy range, but the high-volume selloff to below its 50-day raises some concerns.Qorvo moved back above the 50-day line on Monday, climbing 0.85% to 68.61.Chip stocks had a tough session Friday, with fellow Apple supplier Skyworks (SWKS) tumbling 4.3% despite reporting better-than-expected earnings late Thursday.Paycom, which reports Tuesday, has a best-possible 99 Composite Rating.Paycom makes cloud-based payroll and human resource software, targeting smaller businesses.Paycom cleared a 53.03 buy point on Feb. 17. Shares hit a record high last week, closing Friday at 60.25, extended from that entry area. So there is no proper buy point currently.Paycom rose 0.9% to 60.77 on Monday.Wall Street expects a 24% EPS gain, with a 28.5% revenue rise. That would mark the fourth straight quarter of decelerating growth for both, but would still be solid advances.Impinj, which reports Thursday, has a 96 Composite Rating.Impinj is a radio frequency ID (RFID) chipmaker and an Internet of Things play.The stock came public in July at 14 a share. The stock is working on the right side of a cup base with a 42.01 buy point.Impinj fell 5.2% to 35.53 after tumbling nearly 4% on Friday. But those losses follow 13 straight gains.Impinj is expect to post a 1-cent adjusted loss with revenue of $30.7 million. Both would represent big improvements from a year earlier.Cheesecake Factory, which reports Wednesday, has a 97 Composite Rating.Some restaurant stocks have been doing well, but mostly fast food, fast casual or pizza chains such as McDonald's (MCD), Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) and Domino's Pizza (DPZ). Cheesecake Factory is a rare sit-down restaurant stock that is performing.Cheesecake Factory's stock retook a 64.51 buy point a week ago. But shares dipped 0.9% to 64.16 on Friday, just below the entry, in below-average volume.Cheesecake Factory stock slid 0.6% to 63.80 Monday.Analysts expect a 7% EPS gain, which would end two quarters of acceleration.

The S&P 500 index climbed 1.5% and the Dow Jones industrial average 1.9%, both close to all-time levels.Futures for the Dow industrials rose near 0.2% vs. fair value. S&P 500 index and Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 0.2%. In overseas trading Monday, Japan's Nikkei rose 0.6% while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 climbed 0.55%. Many major Asian and European markets were closed for the international labor day holiday.Advanced Micro Devices is one of a handful of earnings reports on Monday, ahead of Tuesday, when Apple (AAPL), Mastercard (MA), Papa John's (PZZA), a pair of fiber-optic plays and dozens more release quarterly earnings.AMD is expected to report a 4-cent per-share loss after Monday's market close, narrowing vs. a 12-cent loss a year earlier. Revenue should climb 18% to $984.38 million. For the full year, AMD is expected to turn an 8-cent profit vs. a 14-cent loss a year ago.IBD'S TAKE: All-time winning stocks tend to have Composite Ratings of 95 or more near the start of big price moves. Here are the five ""top 5%"" stocks with earnings due this week.AMD shares have been trying to get above their 50-day moving average, moving above that key support intraday on Thursday and Friday but turning back, falling 2.3% to 13.30 in Friday stock market trading.AMD is working on a double-bottom base. A double-bottom pattern is a ""W""-shaped consolidation in which the second leg of the W undercuts that first. As a result, AMD has a potential buy point at 14.85, jut above the center of the ""W.""AMD's chips are used for PC gaming graphics as well as new AI uses. Its results and guidance may offer clues for rival Nvidia (NVDA), which reports on May 9.AMD and Nvidia have similar-looking chart patterns at first glance. But there is a key difference. In Nvidia's case, the second leg of the ""W"" did not quite undercut the intraday low of the first leg. That means it did not shake out as many weak holders as AMD's true double-bottom. Thus, Nvidia's potential buy point for now is 121.02, just above the old high. Nvidia's stock has moved just above its 50-day line.AMD's report also will key for the chip sector, which has been a leading group but faltered at the end of last week. Intel (INTC), which just missed on sales late Thursday, fell 3.4%. But Apple chip supplier Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and chip-gear maker KLA-Tencor (KLAC) sank 4.3% and 5.2% despite better-than-expected profits and sales.Skyworks dragged down other Apple iPhone chipmakers, including Qorvo (QRVO), which fell 4.3%. Qorvo technically fell back into buy range but the heavy-volume decline to just below the 50-day line raises concerns. Qorvo reports earnings Wednesday.For iPhone chipmakers generally, Apple earnings late Tuesday may be the big mover. Expect another quarter of slim profit and sales growth. Investors are betting on strong demand for the upcoming iPhone 8, and perhaps new buybacks and higher dividends from Apple's huge cash pile.The Institute for Supply Management will release its April manufacturing survey at 10 a.m. ET. Economists expect a slight dip to 56.5 from March's 57.2. However, the ISM index has topped the Econoday forecast for seven straight months. Even an in-line reading would be well above the neutral 50 level.On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve will wrap up its two-day policy meeting. Economists don't expect any change in policy, but the central bank's statement could offer clues about future meetings. The odds of a Fed rate hike by the June meeting are now at 63%.On Friday, the Labor Department will release its April employment report.RELATED:The Big Picture: This Key Tech Sector FaltersThis Is Why You Should Consider Amazon, Netflix, Alibaba For Your PortfolioWhich Companies Are Now Outperforming 95% Of All Stocks?Apple, Tesla, Facebook, Fed To Grab Spotlight: Investing Action Plan

114,QRVO,"Stocks racked up commendable gains in light trade Monday, hauling both the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average further above their 50-day moving averages.The session opened boosted by Saturday's announcement of more than $300 billion in long-term deals between U.S. manufacturers and Saudi Arabia, a set of bargains timed to correspond with President Trump's first trip to Saudi Arabia. The news lifted defense plays led by Boeing (BA), Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Raytheon (RTN), as well as National Oilwell Varco (NOV) and others.  Boeing and Lockheed Martin ended up nearly 2%.Ford (F) held its early gain, ending Monday up more than 2% after announcing it had replaced Chief Executive Mark Fields with Jim Hackett, the former CEO of Steelcase (SCS) who has headed Ford's Smart Mobility experimental operations unit. Fields held the CEO seat for three years. Ford shares have been in a 34-month decline.The Nasdaq composite led, up 0.8%, as more than 10% of the Nasdaq 100 stocks climbed more than 2%.  Autodesk (ADSK) led the Nasdaq 100, up more than 3% to a new high and adding to the 15% gain posted last week. Fiber optic telecom stocks posted the session's best gain among industries, boosted by a handful of analyst reports. Acacia Communications (ACIA), Applied OptoElectronics (AAOI) and Finisar (FNSR) each gained more than 10%.Makers of medical software also scored high, skewed higher by a 23% gain by the thinly traded Polarityte (COOL).  Group leader Veeva Systems (VEEV) is extended. But peer Cerner (CERN) is trading just below a 66.37 buy point in a four-weeks tight pattern.The Dow Jones industrial average scaled up 0.5%. Cisco Systems (CSCO) led the index, rebounding 2% as it looked to salvage support at its 40-week moving average after diving 7% in gale-force volume last week.Losses among blue chips were generally modest, Pfizer's (PFE) fell hardest among the Dow industrials, down 1%.The S&P 500 scored a 0.6% gain. Jack Daniels distiller Brown Forman (BFB) ran atop the list with an 8% gain, clearing its prior high from August 2015.Chipmaker Qorvo (QRVO) sped 4% higher and Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) jumped 3%, both taking new highs.Defense consultant Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) spiked 6%, possibly aided by Saturday's announcement of more than $300 billion in U.S-Saudi defense deals, but also because it reported first-quarter earnings and revenue above expectations, and hosted its full year revenue guidance past consensus targets.  The gap up gain lifted shares just above a 37.79 buy point in a flat base.RELATED:Dow Jones Industrial Average and Dow Stocks: News & AnalysisTop Housing Stocks Near Buy Points: Investing Action Plan

115,QRVO,"Futures for the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq 100 were little changed early Friday morning after the major averages staged a modest rebound Thursday following Wednesday's sharp sell-off.Once again, the FANG+ stocks led the way Wednesday. Apple (AAPL) and Amazon.com (AMZN) rose about 1.5% in Thursday stock market trading, with Netflix (NFLX) and Facebook (FB) climbing close to 2%. Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) was a relative laggard, up 0.9%, but still outperformed the major averages.X Apple's ecosystem also thrived. Apple iPhone chipmakers Broadcom (AVGO) (2.8%), Skyworks (SWKS) (2.6%) and Qorvo (QRVO) (4.15%) had big gains.Futures for the Dow industrials and S&P 500 were virtually flat vs. fair value. So were Nasdaq 100 futures. After Thursday's close Applied Materials (AMAT), Salesforce.com (CRM), Ross Stores (ROST), Gap (GPS) and Autodesk (ADSK) rallied on their earnings reports.In Asian trading, Japan's Nikkei rose 0.1% while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 lost 0.2% and China's Shanghai composite was fractionally lower.Last week, Amazon celebrated its 20th anniversary as a public company. On Thursday, Facebook had its fifth anniversary. Facebook went public at 38 a share on May 18, 2012. Shares popped to 45 moments after trading began, but closed near the IPO price. Then it spent more than a year below 38. Finally, it broke out in powerful fashion in July 2013. From that 32.61 buy point, Facebook has soared 354% to Thursday's close of 147.94.IBD'S TAKE: Facebook is a standout company and stock. But it's only ranked sixth in IBD's Internet-Content group. To see which stocks are the group's top performers and how they stack up vs. Facebook and objective criteria, check out IBD's Stock Checkup.It seems obvious in hindsight that Facebook would thrive, even when its stock was underwater for 14 months. But it wasn't. Yahoo (YHOO) fell behind to Google in search, and Google couldn't catch up in social media with its ill-fated Google+. Facebook, like many other internet firms, had to deal with a massive shift to mobile, where ads paid out less. That meant Facebook had to spend more to make less.However, Facebook executed brilliantly. As mobile became its dominant form, additional users and ads translated into massive revenue and earnings growth yet again. Its Instagram purchase — a month before its IPO — turned out to be a boon, especially in battling upstart Snapchat, the main unit of recent IPO Snap (SNAP).On its anniversary, Facebook kept busy. Facebook reached a deal Thursday to live-stream 20 Major League Baseball games. It'll stream a game every Friday for the rest of the season, starting on May 19 with the Colorado Rockies vs. the Cincinnati Reds. Facebook already has a pact with Univision to stream some MLS soccer games.Facebook and other streaming sites are making a big push to cover sports. Amazon recently forged a deal to air the NFL's 10 ""Thursday Night Football"" games next season. Amazon is replacing Twitter, which had those rights in the most recent season.Facebook rebounded from its 50-day moving average on Thursday in above-average volume, though trading cooled from Wednesday. It was solid action at a key support level. But with the current market uptrend under pressure, investors should be cautious about stepping in.RELATED:The Big Picture: 3 Technical Signs That Favor The BullsSalesforce.com Beats Profit, Revenue Views, Tweaks Full-Year OutlookApplied Materials Hails 'Tremendous Momentum'; EPS Growth Tops 100% Again

116,QRVO,"The stock market gyrated throughout the day, maintaining modest gains in midday trading. After a weak open due to Brazil's stock market crash, the major indexes — the Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average — all rallied higher.The tech-heavy Nasdaq, which bore the brunt of Wednesday's sharp sell-off, rose a solid 0.4%. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average had more modest gains, rising 0.2% and 0.1%, respectively. Volume was tracking sharply higher on the NYSE, but edged lower on the Nasdaq vs. the same time Wednesday. Among the Dow industrials, Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) paced the advancers with a 2.4% rise, while Apple (AAPL) followed up with a 1.2% gain. Wal-Mart reported strong Q1 profits early Thursday, but came up short on revenue estimates. The retail giant's shares remain in buy range from a 75.29 cup-base buy point.On the downside, Cisco Systems (CSCO) plunged nearly 8% after disappointing investors late Wednesday with its underwhelming current-quarter revenue guidance.Among the S&P 500, biotech Incyte (INCY) led the way with a 7% rise, while chip stocks Qorvo (QRVO) and Applied Materials (AMAT) ran up 3.3% and 2.2%, respectively. Applied Materials will report its Q2 earnings after the close today. Despite missing Q4 profit estimates, Alibaba (BABA) shares only dropped a little over 1% in midday trading after falling as much as 5.6% earlier in the day. Fellow Chinese stocks Sina (SINA), Weibo (WB) and NetEase (NTES) moved higher on the day, up 2.4%, 1.4% and 0.4%, respectively.A price-target hike sent Nvidia (NVDA) shares 2.3% higher in the stock market today, a welcome sign for investors after yesterday's 6.6% decline. The graphics-chip maker's price target was raised to 148 from 135 at UBS. Action within the IBD 50 was  mostly positive heading into late-day trading. On the upside, China-based Autohome (ATHM) jumped 3.6% to new highs, while recent IPO Floor & Decor (FND) moved 2.5% higher. Autohome is now 17% above a 36.11 cup-base entry, while Floor & Decor may finally be building a base after a successful April 27 IPO.On the downside, MercadoLibre (MELI) declined 4.7%. Volume surged, tracking almost 800% above average. The last two trading days have seen the stock fall 11% from its highs.RELATED:Alibaba Earnings Miss But Revenue Soars 60%; Shares FalterWal-Mart Targets Amazon, Pulls Away From Rivals Online; Stock At 2-Year HighDow Jones Industrial Average And Dow Stocks; News And AnalysisCisco In 'Penalty Box' Amid Growth Woes, Trump Tax Plan Stalls

117,QRVO,"X Futures for the Dow industrials, S&P 500 index and other major averages fell significantly on fresh negative headlines on President Trump. That followed a mixed session Tuesday in which the Nasdaq rallied, hitting fresh record highs, while the Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 closed slightly lower.While the secular bull market is now 8 years old, quality stocks continue to break out of bullish patterns. Four that are in buy range right now: Apple chip supplier Qorvo (QRVO), Citigroup (C), Chinese search giant Baidu (BIDU) and Starbucks (SBUX).S&P 500 index futures fell nearly 0.5% vs. fair value. Futures for the Nasdaq 100 slid 0.35%. Dow Jones industrial average futures retreated 0.4% below fair value, or about 85 points. Dow futures signaled triple-digit losses for much of the night.Late Tuesday, the New York Times, followed by several other big publications, reported that Trump had asked then-FBI Director James Comey to drop an investigation into former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn. The White House denied the reports.Trump, who abruptly fired Comey last week, is also under pressure over a Washington Post article claiming that he gave highly classified information to Russian officials the day after ousting the FBI chief. The political furor makes it harder for Trump and the GOP Congress to focus on pro-growth agenda items, notably tax cuts.Keep in mind that the major market averages have largely shrugged off various setbacks and negative media coverage for the Trump administration. But with key GOP lawmakers saying they plan to call Comey to testify and subpoena the memo that includes his account of Trump's alleged Flynn request, the political headache for the White House is intensifying.In Asian trading, Japan's Nikkei fell 0.5% as the safe-haven yen continued to climb. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 lost 1.1%. The Shanghai composite dipped 0.3%.In European trading intraday, the U.K.'s FTSE edged lower while Germany's Dax slid 0.4% and France's Cac-40 0.5%.IBD'S TAKE: Hours earlier, the odds of a big Trump tax cut were cut after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell set a high hurdle for tax reform.Let's take a look at four stocks that closed in buy range on Tuesday. Investors should be cautious with futures pointing to a lower open. Some of these stocks are only slightly above buy points, and could easily undercut those levels.Qorvo popped 4.6% to 74.84 in Tuesday stock market trading, clearing a shallow consolidation just above a prior consolidation. That followed the Apple iPhone chipmaker's 5.5% gain on Monday. This base-on-base action is bullish, especially when the overall market is moving sideways.Qorvo pulled back below its 50-day moving average in late April, then continued to slide modestly following earnings reports from Apple and then Qorvo itself. But the stock has risen for the last six sessions, capped by Monday's 5.5% surge and Tuesday's breakout.Apple shares closed fractionally lower for a second straight session after hitting a new all-time high intraday Monday.RELATED:Why This Recurring Pattern In The Stock Market Is A Bullish SignCitigroup cleared an aggressive buy point of 60.89 on Friday. The banking giant advanced 1.7% to 62.49 on Tuesday, its highest close since July 2015, still in range of that early entry. But it's also near a conventional 62.63 flat-base buy point, 10 cents above the 22-month intraday peak set March 8.Citigroup is among a handful of financials in or approaching buy points, while many others are in consolidation around or below their 50-day lines. Lower expectations for tax cuts and Treasury yields off their postelection peaks have cooled enthusiasm for bank stocks. But financial regulatory relief is still expected. That would boost bank profit and lending, analysts say, fueling dividend hikes and new buybacks.Baidu was part of the big China internet stock rally Tuesday, fueled by strong earnings and skyrocketing shares of Weibo (WB) and parent Sina (SINA).Baidu rallied 2.4% to 190.64, clearing a 118.70 buy point from a cup-with-handle pattern (starting in late February), as part of a larger consolidation (stretching back to late April 2016).Baidu is part of the China's ""BAT"" internet trio that also includes e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA) and messaging giant Tencent (TCEHY). But while Baidu's growth and stock has stalled, Alibaba and Tencent (which have virtually identical market caps), have soared. Tencent reported 55% revenue growth Wednesday morning with Alibaba on tap Thursday.RELATED:Internet Giant To Join China Parade; Cisco Near Entry: Investing Action PlanStarbucks cleared a buy point of 59.64 on April 20, and moved up to 61.94 a week later. But weaker-than-expected Starbucks revenue sent shares tumbling on April 28, falling as low as 58.99, but closing above the entry point. Starbucks moved higher over the next couple of weeks but has pulled back again in light volume, slipping 0.8% to 59.98.Starbucks' action shows the importance of buying a stock as close to the entry point as possible. Anyone buying at the recent peak of 61.94 would have had a hard time holding on when the stock fell nearly 5% below that purchase price the following morning.RELATED:The Big Picture: Signs Institutions Are Still Buying StocksThese Airline Stocks Close In On Buy Points As Buffett Boosts Stakes

120,QRVO,"Samsung's latest flagship smartphone is packed with high-end chips and other components — making it more expensive than its predecessors and competitors — but Apple's (AAPL) upcoming iPhone 8 is expected to be have similar specifications and also carry a rich price tag.Research firm IHS Markit on Friday released a report on Samsung's new Galaxy S8 smartphone in which researchers took the device apart in what is known as a teardown analysis. It estimates that the Galaxy S8 costs $307.50 to build, $43.34 higher than that of the Galaxy S7.The unsubsidized retail price for the Galaxy S8 with 64 gigabytes of flash memory is about $720. A step-up model, the 6.2-inch Galaxy S8 Plus, costs about $840.The higher build cost for the S8 is ""part of a trend that reflects something of an arms race in features among Apple, Samsung and other phone manufacturers, as they all try to add new and distinguishing hardware features,"" IHS analyst Andrew Rassweiler said in a statement. ""While there are new nonhardware features in the Galaxy S8, such as a virtual assistant called Bixby, from a teardown perspective the hardware in the Galaxy S8 and that of the forthcoming new iPhone is expected to be very similar.""Two major components of the Galaxy S8 are its gigabit LTE capability for much faster data transfer speeds and its borderless 5.8-inch ultra-high-definition OLED display.Apple's iPhone 8 could retail for $1,000 because of its premium feature set, some analysts speculate. Apple's current top-of-the-line handset, the 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus, starts at $769 for the base model with 32-gigabytes of data storage.Component suppliers in the Galaxy S8 are carry-overs from the S7, IHS analyst Wayne Lam said in an email.Qualcomm (QCOM) is supplying its Snapdragon 835 chip set for S8 models in the U.S. and China, while Samsung is using its Exynos chip set for S8 models in the rest of the world.Broadcom (AVGO) and Qorvo (QRVO) are supplying radio-frequency chips for the S8.

122,QRVO,"Apple (AAPL) is unlikely to develop its own radio frequency chips for iPhones, making it less likely Broadcom (AVGO),  Qorvo (QRVO), or Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) could be displaced by the iPhone maker, says a Pacific Crest Securities analyst.While Pacific Crest analyst John Vinh says Apple also is unlikely to develop its own audio chips — a plus for Cirrus Logic (CRUS) — he speculates that Synaptics (SYNA) could be at risk of losing business. San Jose-based Synaptics makes chips that control iPhone displays.Shares in Cirrus Logic, Qorvo, and Skyworks fell on Tuesday after a report that Apple will replace power management devices made by Germany's Dialog Semiconductor with in-house technology, possibly as soon as 2019. That report followed U.K.-based Imagination Technologies' warning to investors Apple that was phasing out its graphics chips in iPhones.""In light of concerns over Imagination Technologies graphics chips and Dialog Semiconductor power management chips being insourced at Apple, we believe the risk of Synaptics being displaced is medium to high, while we see risk of RF suppliers and Cirrus Logic being integrated as medium to low,"" Vinh said in a report. ""We believe the risk that RF semiconductors would be insourced is low, given high technical barriers to entry and protection of intellectual property.""Dialog stock fell 14% on Tuesday in Germany.

Analysts at Bankhaus Lampe on Tuesday claimed there was ""strong evidence"" that Apple was working on making its own power management chips for the iPhone. Dialog has not commented.Bankhaus Lampe downgraded Dialog to ""sell"" saying that Apple is working on its own battery-saving chip for the iPhone — which could replace Dialog's power circuits as early as 2019.The news comes little more than a week after shares in Imagination Technologies, a U.K. chip designer, plummeted after the company warned investors Apple was phasing out its chips in iPhones.Imagination Technologies garners royalty payments from Apple.Expectations for a strong iPhone upgrade cycle had been rising, sending up shares of Cirrus Logic (CRUS), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Qorvo (QRVO).

147,QRVO,"Apple's (AAPL) iPhone 8 smartphone hasn't been announced yet, but analysts are already picking winners and losers among component suppliers for the rumored device.Rosenblatt Securities analyst Jun Zhang on Friday predicted that Cypress Semiconductor (CY), Dialog Semiconductor, Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM) and Qorvo (QRVO) would be content-gainers in Apple's next-generation handset.Component-share losers in the iPhone 8 likely will include Analog Devices (ADI), Cirrus Logic (CRUS) and Qualcomm (QCOM), he said.Cypress could gain a USB type-C driver in the handset, Zhang said. Maxim likely has a design win for the power-management chip for the OLED display, he said. Qorvo will gain content, but at a lower gross margin, he said.Qualcomm is likely to be a loser as Apple shifts more to Intel (INTC) wireless chips. Apple and Qualcomm are engaged in a nasty legal battle over wireless-patent royalties and terms.Cirrus Logic is expected to lose power amplifier share to Maxim, Zhang said. And Analog Devices lost the Force Touch component business to a competitor for the OLED iPhone.Apple is expected to introduce the iPhone 8 in September, along with iPhone 7S handsets, which are upgraded versions of the current iPhone 7 devices. The iPhone 8 is likely to be in very short supply initially because of production snags that Apple's contract manufacturers have experienced. Component suppliers have had trouble integrating the fingerprint security sensor into the OLED display, analysts say.The iPhone 8 is expected to be Apple's biggest smartphone redesign since the iPhone 6, which came out in September 2014. The iPhone 8 is rumored to feature a 5.8-inch borderless OLED screen, glass-sandwich design, wireless charging and augmented-reality capability. Apple is expected to replace the physical home button with a virtual on-screen button, which will allow for a larger display.Many Wall Street analysts expect the iPhone 8 — Apple's 11th-generation handset and 10th-anniversary smartphone — to kick off a ""supercycle"" of upgrade purchases among iPhone users.Earlier this month, Pacific Crest Securities identified chipmakers Broadcom (AVGO), Cirrus Logic and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) as three companies likely to benefit from the release of the iPhone 8.Audio-chip maker Cirrus Logic has the highest exposure to Apple of the three companies spotlighted by Pacific Crest.

150,QRVO,"Imagine you buy a quality stock and it never gets much past the 5% buy zone. Day after day, the stock dances either near or within the buy zone.At the same time, the stock doesn't trigger a sell rule, such as the 7% to 8% loss-cutting stop.How much time should you give the stock? And which is the more likely next step — an advance toward a double-digit percentage gain, or a descent to the 7% loss?So far this year, 20 quality stocks have cleared buy points in strong volume only to stall in or near the 5% buy zone. What happened next?The results can be sorted into four tiers of varying success and failure.First tier: Four of the 20 stocks eventually went on to rise 15% or more from the ideal buy point.Driver-assistance software maker Mobileye (MBLY) spent about four weeks loitering in the buy zone after a February breakout past a 45.03 buy point. Even an earnings report that came in 10% above expectations didn't help Mobileye much. Finally, the stock gapped up in mid-March on news that Intel (INTC) would buy Mobileye. The stock rose 37% from the original entry.Ad tech firm Criteo (CRTO) spent almost seven weeks in the buy zone after a breakout past a 44.24 entry on Jan. 11. The breakout came in low volume, but heavy volume kicked in about 12 days after the initial clearing of the entry. (The stock price remained little changed during the 12 sessions, keeping a potential buy alive.)Criteo fell about 3% on Feb. 22 despite trouncing the consensus on earnings. The next day it popped 5% and cleared the buy zone. The stock's gain eventually reached about 21%.Mortgage insurance provider Essent Group (ESNT) cleared a 34.04 flat-base buy point on Jan. 25. The stock seesawed above and below the buy zone. The gain eventually reached 16%.After clearing a 53.03 entry in a lopsided base, midcap stock Paycom Software (PAYC) bobbed within and just above the buy zone for five weeks, then rose to a gain of 15%.Second tier: Six stocks ended the post-breakout sideways action with moderate gains of 10% to 13%.The six are Priceline.com (PCLN), CommScope (COMM), Alibaba (BABA), Dave & Buster's Entertainment (PLAY), Qorvo (QRVO) and Tarena International (TEDU).So the totals for stuck stocks that resolved the inaction with positive outcomes is 10 of 20.Third tier: Three stocks neither rose much above the 5% buy zone nor triggered a sell rule: Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM), Ulta Beauty (ULTA) and Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR). Their stories are still being sketched.Fourth tier: The bottom tier is comprised of seven stocks — initially stuck in the buy zone — that eventually triggered the 7% to 8% sell rule. However, five of the seven showed gains of 7% to 9% before starting the slide to the sell rule. A disciplined investor could've sold the stocks for a small gain before they cycled into a loss.Overall, the sideways action after the breakout has been worth enduring. Either the outcome was positive or savvy portfolio management could have helped the individual investor dodge the worst outcomes.RELATED:To Find Big Winners Seek The A In CAN SLIMLearn To Recognize Flaws In The ChartHow To Invest: Still The Golden Rule Of Selling

153,QRVO,"Samsung's newest flagship smartphone, the Galaxy S8, is likely to provide a sales boost for a number of component makers, including Broadcom (AVGO), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Universal Display (OLED), analysts say.After Samsung introduced its Galaxy S8 handsets at a media event Wednesday in New York City, Pacific Crest Securities analyst John Vinh said the Galaxy S8 is a ""slight positive"" for Broadcom, Integrated Device Technology (IDTI), Qorvo (QRVO) and Skyworks.Meanwhile, Cowen analyst Timothy Arcuri believes the Galaxy S8 has positive implications for Immersion (IMMR), Skyworks, Synaptics (SYNA) and Universal Display.Among the stocks highlighted by Pacific Crest and Cowen, the biggest movers on the stock market today included Universal Display, which surged more than 6% at one point but ended the day up 2.4% to 86.70. Immersion ended trading with a larger percentage gain, though it started off slower, finishing up 2.5% to 8.58. Qorvo was up 1.8% to 69.08.Broadcom slipped 0.6% to 220.04 while Skyworks was up 0.9% to 98.14.Universal Display provides technology and materials for making organic light-emitting diode, or OLED, displays. The S8 will feature a borderless OLED screen called an Infinity Display, using Universal's products.Immersion is seen providing haptic feedback technology, which adds physical sensations like vibrations to user interfaces. On the S8, it is used for the phone's force-sensing, on-screen virtual home button.Synaptics could benefit from Samsung's use of multimode biometric security technology in the Galaxy S8, Arcuri said in a report.Further, radio-frequency chipmakers Broadcom, Qorvo and Skyworks will see an increased content opportunity from the S8 handsets, Vinh said in a report. IDT will benefit from sales of its next-generation wireless transceiver for wireless charging, Vinh said.IBD'S TAKE: Qorvo is one of 10 chip industry stocks on the IBD 50 list of top-performing growth companies.Samsung also introduced a new Gear 360 camera for taking 360-degree videos and still images for playback in virtual-reality headsets as well as PCs and mobile devices. This news was unfavorable for action-camera maker GoPro (GPRO), Arcuri said.""This is negative for GoPro, which we believe is late entering the consumer 360-degree capture market,"" Arcuri said.The pocket-size Gear 360 captures high-definition 4K video and can live-stream in HD. It is compatible with a number of Galaxy models as well as Apple's (AAPL) iPhone. It is expected to go on sale in late April or May and cost less than its predecessor, which was priced at $350.RELATED:Samsung's Galaxy S8 Gets Jump On iPhone 8, But Apple Stock Hits High

158,QRVO,"Biotech sector funds ruled the roost last year but technology focused funds are the clear winners now.Of 217 sector funds that are 10 years or older with at least $100 million in assets, three of the five top sector funds of 2016 were focused on technology. The other two represented the financial services and transportation sectors.All five sector funds featured in the 2017 IBD Mutual Fund Awards beat the benchmark S&P 500 for the past one, three, five and 10 years. Apple or iPhone-related chip stocks were a common underlying theme among the three technology funds.Fidelity Select Semiconductors Portfolio (FSELX) was the top-performing sector fund last year with a 32.4% return. Its three, five and 10-year average annual return is 23.3%, 22% and 10.9%, respectively. The S&P 500 rose nearly 12% last year and 9.9%, 14.7% and 7% for the same periods. Fidelity Select Semiconductors is still beating the S&P 500 so far this year with a gain of 8.58% vs. 5.09%, though it's trailing the top sector funds by about eight percentage points.The Fidelity fund, launched in July 1985, has $2.8 billion in total assets. In October, it changed its name from Fidelity Select Electronics Portfolio to better reflect its focus on chipmakers and chip designers.""Despite a subdued macro environment — semiconductor industry revenue was essentially flat for the past couple of years — semiconductor stocks performed well,"" Steve Barwikowski, who has managed the fund since 2009, told IBD. ""The biggest factor has been M&A with roughly $100 billion worth of deals in each of the last two years.""More than 99% of the fund's assets were in tech stocks, while less than a percentage point was in communications services. Intel (INTC), Qualcomm (QCOM), Broadcom (AVGO), Analog Devices (ADI) and Applied Materials (AMAT), its top five holdings at the end of the year, accounted for 52% of the fund's assets.Barwikowski thinks the chip industry could benefit from the new administration's pro-growth policies in areas such as tax and trade.""I am optimistic that the chips are poised for the best growth we have seen in a few years driven by a combination of healthy supply chain inventories, a more stable personal computing market, continued secular growth in the auto and cloud markets, a strong mobile phone cycle in the second half of the year, and potentially a healthier global macro environment,"" he said. ""Strong fundamentals are somewhat balanced by higher valuations, but there are definitely good opportunities for stock picking.""Up next is RMB Mendon Financial Services (RMBKX) with a 29.7% return in 2016. The $557.4 million fund, managed by Mendon Capital Advisors founder Anton Schutz, was launched in June 1999.As of Nov. 30, the fund was 85% invested in U.S. stocks and had less than 4% in cash. The top five holdings in the 62-stock portfolio were BNC Bancorp (BNCN), Yadkin Financial (YDKN), OceanFirst Financial (OCFC), Atlantic Capital Bancshares (ACBI) and Opus Bank (OPB).""Most of the gain in the financial services sector came in the last two months of the quarter following the surprising results of the presidential election,"" Schutz wrote in the fund's Q4 commentary. ""With visibility increasing around who the decision makers will be in Washington for the next four years, it became clear this was a significant inflection point for financial services in terms of both fundamentals and valuations.""He noted tail winds including corporate tax reform, amendments to Dodd-Frank and the delay of new Department of Labor rules.Fidelity Select Transportation Fund (FSRFX), with $644.7 million in assets, returned 10.5% last year. Industrials accounted for 99.1% of assets as of Jan. 31, with consumer cyclicals and technology making up less than 1%.Its top holdings by weighting as of Dec. 31 were United Parcel Service (UPS), Union Pacific (UNP), FedEx (FDX), CSX (CSX) and American Airlines Group (AAL).""My approach centers on the concepts of value and risk,"" fund manager Matthew Moulis said on Fidelity.com. ""In particular, I look for stocks that I think represent good value, where value is related to the price paid for attributes such as expected profit growth, return on capital and conversion of free cash flow.""Red Oak Technology Select Fund (ROGSX) came in third with a 24.6% return last year. Its average annual gains for the past three, five and 10 years were 12.9%, 18.4% and 11.5%, respectively. The Red Oak fund held total assets of $412.6 million as of Dec. 31, according to fund tracker Morningstar.Technology accounted for 86% of the fund's holdings as of Dec. 31, followed by consumer cyclical, financial services and industrials, at less than 6% each. Mark Oelschlager manages the fund. The fund's top five holdings were Alphabet (GOOGL), Nvidia (NVDA), Cisco Systems (CSCO), Microsoft (MSFT) and Intel (INTC), which recently agreed to by Mobileye (MBLY). Nearly a quarter, or 23%, of the fund's assets were in these names.Red Oak Technology and Fidelity Select Semiconductors both owned Intel, which had a 20% run in Q4. The chip giant's shares have dipped 2% this year, but IBD's overall chipmaker industry group has gained 8% this year and is ranked No. 38 among the 197 tracked by IBD.Columbia Seligman Communications & Information (SLMCX) rounds out the top five with a 15.4% return in 2016. Paul Wick has managed the $4.9 billion fund for 27 years. The fund was 91% invested in technology, 3% each in financial services and consumer cyclicals, and a little over 1% in industrials.Several chip names made its top five as of Jan. 31, including Lam Research (LRCX), Broadcom and Qorvo (QRVO). The three stocks rose 12%, 23% and 26% in Q4 last year. Apple (AAPL), up 20%, was also a top holding. The iPhone maker has rallied this year — it's close to the 20% profit-taking zone from a Jan. 9 breakout past a 117.12 cup-with-handle entry.""We are generally positive about the technology sector going forward despite many of the end markets being challenged for growth, whether that be in PCs, smartphones or networking,"" the managers said in their Q4 commentary. ""We are feeling optimistic about U.S. economic prospects in the wake of the election. In particular, we are enthusiastic that a less onerous regulatory environment should lead to more robust U.S. economic growth and that repatriation of cash held overseas will benefit a huge swath of technology companies in which the portfolio is invested.""RELATED:What's The Stock Market Doing Now?

Meanwhile, graphics chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) received a price target hike from one investment bank.Audio chipmaker Cirrus Logic saw its shares tumble 14% to close at 55 on the stock market today. The stock had jumped 6% to 63.96 on Wednesday after key customer Apple reported better-than-expected December quarter results. Intraday Wednesday it hit an all-time high of 64.16.But late Wednesday Cirrus gave a March quarter outlook that was below views.Austin, Texas-based Cirrus earned $1.87 a share excluding items, up 128% year over year, on sales of $523 million, up 50%, in its fiscal third quarter ended Dec. 24. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters were expecting $1.63 a share ex items on sales of $496 million. Cirrus got a boost from better-than-expected Apple iPhone sales last quarter, analysts said.IBD'S TAKE: The IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks includes 10 chip industry stocks.

184,QRVO,"Chip stocks took it on the chin Thursday as widespread tech-stock selling pulled down top semiconductor companies.Some chipmakers, including Broadcom (AVGO), Cirrus Logic (CRUS) and Qualcomm (QCOM), likely were hurt by a report of Apple (AAPL) cutting production orders for its iPhone 7.Other chip stocks fell as institutional investors rotated out of tech stocks into other sectors, such as bank and oil stocks.Broadcom stock closed down 4.5% at 162.79 on the stock market today. Cirrus Logic sank 10.3% to 49.32, and Qualcomm fell 5.8% 64.16.Other major semiconductor firms hurt by the sell-off included Nvidia (NVDA), down 5%, Qorvo (QRVO), down 6.3%, Microchip Technology (MCHP), down 7.5%, and Intel (INTC), down 2.7%.IBD'S TAKE: The IBD 50 list of top growth stocks includes seven chip companies, including Nvidia and Microchip. The IBD 50 is one of many proprietary stock analysis tools for investors to consult on Investors.com.IBD's two chip industry groups, chip manufacturers and fabless chipmakes, lost 4.9% and 4.8%, respectively, and were the second- and third-to-worse performers among IBD's 197 industry groups, behind on the Food-Diary Products group.One chip stock that defied the trend was Semtech (SMTC), which gained 3.6% Thursday.Semtech, a designer of analog and mixed-signal semiconductors, late Wednesday reported better-than-expected third-quarter sales and earnings and guided higher for Q4.RELATED:Micron Stock Gets Price-Target Hikes On Raised Q1 GuidanceBroadcom Stock Nears Buy Point On Bullish ReportMacom Technology Solutions Gets Price-Target Hike On Acquisition News

185,QRVO,"Apple (AAPL) iPhone shipments are likely to drop in the first half of 2017 vs. the same period in 2016, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said in a report.He predicts Apple will ship 40 million to 50 million iPhones in Q1, vs. 51.2 million in the year-earlier period. For Q2, Kuo is forecasting Apple to ship 35 million to 40 million iPhones, vs. 40.4 million a year earlier, according to Apple news website 9to5Mac.The iPhone shipment declines will put pressure on Apple's chip suppliers, Kuo said. At the same time, Apple is pushing component suppliers to reduce their prices, he said.Component suppliers with heavy exposure to Apple include Cirrus Logic (CRUS), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Qorvo (QRVO).IBD'S TAKE: Apple stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 68, meaning it has outperformed 68% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months. However, there are more attractive stocks for investors to consider. For a list of leading growth stocks, check out the IBD 50.Apple is unlikely to refresh its lower-cost iPhone SE in Q1 or Q2 because the company wants to avoid cannibalizing sales of its premium iPhone 7 handsets, Kuo said. The iPhone SE debuted on March 24. Apple's decision to not upgrade the iPhone SE around its one-year anniversary is a move to bolster its gross profit margins, Kuo said.The primary reason for the iPhone shipment drop in the first half of 2017 is weak demand in China, Kuo said.Apple is expected to release its biggest change to the iPhone in three years with the iPhone 8 next fall. That 11th-generation handset is expected to have OLED display and wireless charging in at least some models.The iPhone 8 is expected to sport a new look, with a glass front and back in a metal frame.Apple stock closed up 1.4% at 110.41 on the stock market today.RELATED:OLED iPhones Could Spur Demand, But Lower Profit MarginsApple Contractor Testing Wireless Charging Module For iPhone 8Apple iPhone Grabs 104% Of Smartphone Industry Profit In Q3Skyworks Delights, Qorvo Disappoints In Earnings Reports

186,QRVO,"Apple (AAPL) and the iPhone ecosystem owe much of their torrid growth to the 3G and 4G wireless networks that whisked games, apps, photos and video to the computerlike smartphones.Now the 5G, or fifth generation, wireless revolution is near, promising data speeds 50 to 100 times faster than 4G LTE networks. Sure it'll improve smartphones, but that's not the point. Analysts say 5G's biggest impact will be to drive the proliferation of the Internet of Things — billions of connected devices.The business case for 5G is all about IoT, an evolution, or maybe revolution, that will take the internet era into new territories. Companies including chipmakers, network equipment makers and telecom service providers are investing heavily in the technology, with the first products to roll out in 2017.""With 5G, there are going to be many more device categories,"" Matt Grob, Qualcomm chief technology officer, told IBD.IBD'S TAKE: 5G holds big promise for the future, but how are key players performing now? One company worth watching is Arista Networks, a 2014 IPO that is battling Cisco Systems, the longtime networking gear leader. Arista is on the IBD 50 ranking of the top-performing stocks,  a good place to look for stocks possibly worth buying.IoT encompasses such burgeoning arenas as self-driving cars, advanced robotics, telemedicine, automated factories, smart cities and the development of massive sensor networks in such fields as agriculture. Farmers will, for example, know exactly when to harvest for best yields based on air temperature and soil moisture.Many of the companies aiming to put 5G on the fast track — Qualcomm (QCOM), Intel (INTC), Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Verizon Communications (VZ) to name a few — expect new revenue streams from the IoT and game-changing apps outside of smartphones.Qualcomm aims to ship its first 5G modem chips for phones in the second half of 2017, with follow-on chips targeting the IoT.Qualcomm, like others, expects 5G to evolve on multiple tracks: IoT, smartphones and fixed residential. While Apple, Samsung and others will ship 5G smartphones only after standards are rubber-stamped, which observers say will be a work in progress until 2020 or later, carriers are closer with ""fixed"" 5G, a wireless broadband service provided from a fixed point to homes in limited areas. If  fixed 5G to homes works well in trials, Verizon says it will pursue a commercial rollout city-by-city in 2018 and 2019. It hasn't identified the cities yet.With 4G networks, it costs wireless firms about $1 to deliver a gigabyte of data. 5G networks promise much better economics. It also will provide virtually uninterrupted communications for new apps.""5G is going to bring lower costs per bit, lower latency and highly reliable services,"" Grob said. ""So it's going to be great for autonomous vehicles, medical devices and for infrastructure and smart cities. There are more companies taking part in the standards development for 5G than ever.""Medical applications include remote monitoring of devices like EKGs or blood pressure monitors. Smart city technologies include traffic signals that adjust to vehicle flows and sensor-based water systems that test for contaminants in real time.The Internet of Things isn't waiting on 5G. AT&T (T) already has some 8 million web-connected cars linked to its 4G network. U.K.-based Vodafone (VOD) says it had 41 million IoT connections as of Sept. 30. Cisco says its gear links 4.9 billion devices now and will connect 12.2 billion by 2020, and few will be 5G.But the more speed, the better.Some companies might get a good boost early in the 5G revolution, such as makers of network testing gear like Keysight Technology (KEYS). Independent testing is a big part of the standards-setting process.Early on, analysts say Xilinx (XLNX) programmable chips will be useful for prototyping 5G products, while the higher radio frequency bands associated with 5G may create long-term opportunities for RF chip leaders Broadcom (AVGO) , Qorvo (QRVO) and Murata.As small cells are deployed in urban areas, cell tower firm Crown Castle (CCI) and startup Tarana Wireless aim to capture share. Tarana's biggest investor is AT&T. Some analysts view Zayo Holdings (ZAYO) as a takeover candidate, because small cell systems require fiber-optic links in metro areas for long-haul transport.Next-generation data centers — to keep all these things humming on the internet — will be another battleground, as Cisco takes on Arista Networks (ANET), startup Affirmed Networks and others.Meanwhile, startup SigFox, the LoRa alliance — with members including Cisco and IBM (IBM) — and others aim to provide all IoT devices with low-power connections via Wi-Fi and unlicensed spectrum.5G backers aim to create flexible networks that provide both the high-bandwidth connections required by fast-moving, self-driving cars in urban areas and always-on, reliable, low-data-rate connections needed by parking meters, oil rig sensors or other devices.While 4G networks provide cars with infotainment, 5G services are expected to provide real-time environmental data so, for example, driverless cars can avoid collisions.To service various types of devices, wireless networks will need to utilize both very high radio frequencies not yet commercialized and lower-band airwaves. Improved radio antennas and more complex semiconductors are expected to make higher frequencies usable for 5G.In urban areas, hundreds of ""small cell"" antennas hung on utility poles or buildings will work together, analysts say.Wireless networks and telecom data centers will be upgraded to provide both high and low data rate services, again to service various types of sensors and devices. AT&T and Verizon are among the leaders in moving to software-defined-network technology. SDN will help usher in 5G. With it, wireless firms can improve network bandwidth allocation and provide cloud-based, on-demand services.Part of the 5G revolution involves connecting a network of data centers to the IoT. That's a focus for Intel, Cisco, China's Huawei and many other companies.""5G will be a whole transformation of the network to virtualization, providing more flexibility and agility,"" said Jean Luc Valente, vice president of product management for Cisco's cloud and virtualization group. ""With 5G, with connected cars, some data is going to be collected, maybe at a traffic light intersection. Those data nuggets will be (analyzed), maybe not in the back-end data center, maybe much closer in a micro-cloud."" The upshot, among many benefits, is that self-driving cars won't collide.Cisco aims to provide cloud-based IoT services as it shifts away from hardware sales. The company partnered in February with Intel and Sweden's Ericsson (ERIC) to start selling a swath of 5G hardware and services. They are involved in 5G trials by Verizon and others.As 5G sparks partnerships, it's also generating M&As with 5G or IoT angles.Qualcomm expects its pending acquisition of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) to pay dividends in autonomous cars. Japan-based SoftBank acquired wireless chip designer ARM Holdings for $31 billion with an eye toward I0T.AT&T says it will move to 5G faster if regulators approve its acquisition of media giant Time Warner (TWX), part of its strategy to whisk more video to mobile devices.Cisco bought Jasper in March for $1.4 billion, gaining a cloud-based IoT platform. Verizon in February announced an agreement to acquire XO Communications, which owns high-frequency spectrum for 5G services, for $1.8 billion.Internet leaders, too, are jockeying for leading roles in 5G. Facebook (FB) is working with equipment vendors and carriers on standards. Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) is developing open software for the IoT.For Intel, 5G and IoT offer an opportunity to turn its money-losing mobile business around, says Citigroup. For Qualcomm, the shift to 5G should provide higher profit margins as the 4G generation matures.South Korea's KT and Verizon are forging ahead in prestandard deployment of 5G, aiming to drive technical specifications for 5G radio gear. KT plans to showcase 5G technology at the 2018 Winter Olympics, though just how isn't known.Aside from the Internet of Things and 5G mobility, Verizon is eyeing fixed 5G wireless broadband services to homes, potentially taking on cable TV companies. It's not clear yet if 5G fixed broadband could provide high-speed internet in neighborhoods or blanket bigger areas, analysts say. The Verizon trials will help determine that.Verizon has been investing across the board — in SDN, small cell technology and fixed wireless, says Adam Koeppe, vice president of technology planning at Verizon.""We're putting in the building blocks for what comes next. IoT is one of them,"" he said. ""The goal of the IoT device evolution is to have very low-cost modules, with long battery life. Think of sensors, smart meters — things that get embedded in day-to-day infrastructure and products that communicate on low bandwidth, on a sliver of spectrum, gobbling up very little of network resources.""""Where 5G fits into the equation is scale,"" Koeppe added. ""IoT will be about tens of billions of devices connected to the network. When you think of truly connected societies — traffic lights, stop signs, parking meters and everything within a city connected and interacting with itself — that's where 5G comes into play.""Yet 5G-related revenue is still on the distant horizon for most companies, analysts say. The marketing hype has picked up long before 5G networks and services will be deployed.IoT revenue is about 1% of global mobile revenue now and will grow at about 20% annually over the next five years, says market research firm Analysys Mason. Revenue is small in part because monthly revenue from IoT devices might come to just $1 or $2, not the $60 or more from smartphone users.RELATED:Qualcomm Upgraded On NXP Acquisition, Adds 'Tons Of Scale'Verizon Among Those With Lots At Stake With Next FCC ChairmanCisco Rival Arista Soars On Import Green Light

189,QRVO,"Broadcom (AVGO) stock rocketed late Thursday after its first post-merger earnings report, topping Wall Street's earnings view by 15 cents and edging revenue views despite Apple's (AAPL) first year-over-year decline in iPhone sales.In after-hours trading, Broadcom stock was up more than 6% following its fiscal Q2 earnings release. Shares rose a fraction in Thursday's regular session, to 154.91, and are up 6% for the year.For its Q2 ended May 1, Broadcom reported $3.56 billion in sales minus items and $2.53 earnings per share ex items, up 117% and 19%, respectively, vs. last year, and leading the consensus estimate of 30 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters for $3.55 billion and $2.38.Current-quarter guidance for $3.75 billion in sales ex items, plus or minus $75 million, would be up 114% on a year-over-year basis, topping analysts' model for $3.71 billion. The non-GAAP guidance includes $10 million in licensing revenue.The quarter was Broadcom's first reporting combined Broadcom and Avago metrics, while the year-earlier figures were for Avago only. The former Avago bought Broadcom for $37 billion, a deal that closed on Feb. 1, keeping the Broadcom name and Avago's ticker. Now, analysts say Broadcom could deleverage and seek more M&A.Broadcom competes against fellow Apple suppliers Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Qorvo (QRVO) to provide radio-frequency chips for smartphones, including the iPhone.A UBS analyst was bullish earlier Thursday on RF names vs. analog names like Analog Devices (ADI) and Texas Instruments (TXN), both also Apple suppliers who've seen investors pull back because of the companies' consumer exposure.

190,QRVO,"Broadcom (AVGO) CEO Hock Tan hinted Thursday at Apple's (AAPL) ""imminent"" recovery, thanks to its iPhone 7 ramp, MKM analyst Ing Ing said Friday after Tan guided to 20% sequential wireless growth in the July quarter and increased content in the 7 vs. the iPhone 6S.Sales of Apple's iPhone 6S have largely disappointed. In April, Apple reported its first year-over-year decline in iPhone sales. The July quarter will be ""a very different picture,"" Tan told analysts Thursday during the company's Q2 earnings conference call.A ""large North American customer"" -- widely assumed to be Apple -- is ramping up its next flagship smartphone with a ""substantial"" increase in Broadcom content, Tan said on the call. That will likely increase again in October, he said.IBD Take: Broadcom ranks No. 7 in its big group. Find out why at IBD Stock Checkup.""A strong Apple smartphone cycle appears imminent,"" Ing wrote in a research report Friday as he boosted his price target on Broadcom stock to 188 from 162. Ing reiterated his buy rating on Broadcom stock.Ing was one of at least 16 analysts Friday to boost their price targets on Broadcom stock following the company's fiscal Q2 earnings report late Thursday. Broadcom stock gapped up to a record high of 166 early on the stock market today, and shares were up nearly 5%, to 162.56 at the close.Radio-frequency competitors Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Qorvo (QRVO) stocks also lifted early Friday, though Qorvo was down a fraction in morning trading. Broadcom's fiscal Q3 guidance topped the consensus, and it posted a hefty 15-cent Q2 earnings beat on better-than-expected post-Avago merger synergies.Late Thursday, Broadcom reported $792 million in wireless sales, up 38% vs. the year-earlier quarter but missing guidance for $820 million. Wired infrastructure sales soared 440% to $2.06 billion. Enterprise storage and industrial sales came in at $525 million and $182 million, up 12% and down 17%, respectively. Broadcom's Tomahawk switches drove blowout wired revenue, Craig-Hallum analyst Anthony Stoss said Friday.Stoss maintained his buy rating and 200 price target on Broadcom stock, and he sees Broadcom growing its iPhone 7 content by 30% vs. the iPhone 6S, potentially offsetting the possibility of another dip in iPhone unit shipments.Investors are missing the runway on RF chipmakers, Stoss wrote in a research report.""We expect at least several more years of additional content gains due to more bands, carrier aggregation and additional RF filters,"" he wrote. ""We believe the expected launch of 5G in 2020 will only add to the content gains and RF flexibility.""He also expects Broadcom's appetite for M&A might be growing. Broadcom paid off $565 million of debt in Q2 and expects to pay $1 billion in Q3 with cash from divestitures, such as the sale of its Internet of Things unit to Cypress Semiconductor (CY).Analysts have posited Broadcom could make a play for small chipmaker Xilinx (XLNX). Fellow Apple supplier Qualcomm (QCOM) has also been thrown into the hypothetical Xilinx bidder mix. In 2015, chip sector M&A topped $115 billion.""We believe Broadcom will be in a position to make an additional acquisition or two by the end of this calendar year,"" Stoss wrote. ""Broadcom has demonstrated the ability to extract substantial value and reap the benefits of scale through accretive acquisitions.""

192,QRVO,"Apple (AAPL) chip suppliers Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Qorvo (QRVO) diverged after they posted September-quarter financial results late Thursday. Skyworks delivered a beat-and-raise report, while Qorvo disappointed with guidance and gave mixed fiscal second-quarter results.Skyworks rose 0.5% to 75.07 on the stock market today, while Qorvo fell 10% to 51.08 and hit a five-month low.Skyworks Solutions earned $1.47 a share excluding items, down 3% year over year, on sales of $835.4 million, down 5%, in its fiscal Q4. Analysts were modeling Skyworks to earn $1.43 a share on sales of $831.3 million.The Woburn, Mass.-based company guided to $1.58 EPS and $902 million in sales for the December quarter, vs. Wall Street's targets of $1.56 EPS and $893 million in sales.IBD'S TAKE: Skyworks has an IBD Composite Rating of 92, but it ranks No. 12 out of 40 stocks in IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Manufacturing industry group. To see which companies lead the group, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.Skyworks stock earned price-target hikes from Cowen, Craig Hallum and Needham. Cowen maintained its buy rating and upped its price target to 80 from 72. Craig Hallum reiterated its buy rating and raised its PT to 90 from 85. Needham stuck with its buy rating and increased its price target to 84 from 73.Qorvo earned $1.29 a share excluding items, up 6%, on sales of $864.7 million, up 22%, in its fiscal Q2. Analysts were looking for adjusted EPS of $1.41 on sales of $834.8 million.Qorvo guided to $1.25 EPS and $820 million in sales, well short of Wall Street's target of $1.45 EPS and $845 million in sales.Greensboro, N.C.-based Qorvo has been plagued by manufacturing yield issues, Oppenheimer analyst Rick Schafer said in a research report.Bank of America Merrill Lynch downgraded Qorvo to underperform from buy after the earnings news.Cowen reiterated its market perform rating on Qorvo, but cut its price target to 53 from 65.Mergers and acquisitions in the semiconductor industry have overshadowed earnings reports from chip firms this earnings season.Mobile chip maker Qualcomm (QCOM), which plans to buy NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), on Wednesday posted fiscal Q4 results that beat Wall Street's expectations.Qualcomm said its earnings per share excluding items rose 41% to $1.28 while sales rose 13% to $6.17 billion. Analysts were expecting EPS of $1.13 on sales of $5.84 billion.On Thursday, shares of chipmaker Microsemi (MSCC) soared on a report that fellow mixed-signal-chip expert Skyworks has approached the company about a potential acquisition.Skyworks is benefiting from growing content wins in mobile phones. Apple accounts for about 40% of its revenue, Samsung 15% and Chinese vendors 20%, Schafer said.""Skyworks' growth trajectory remains on track to benefit from increasing demands for integrated RF/analog solutions,"" Schafer said.

196,QRVO,"Samsung's decision to cancel production and sales of its problem-plagued Galaxy Note 7 smartphone is likely to have a ""modest negative impact"" on several mobile-chip suppliers, Pacific Crest Research said Tuesday.Semiconductor manufacturers with the most exposure to Samsung business include Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM), Synaptics (SYNA), Qualcomm (QCOM) and Qorvo (QRVO).Maxim has the highest exposure to Samsung, with the South Korean tech giant accounting for 4.2% of Maxim's revenue, Pacific Crest said in a research report. Synaptics is second with 2.9% of revenue from Samsung, followed by Qualcomm (2.7%) and Qorvo (2.3%), the investment bank said.IBD'S TAKE: The semiconductor industry has been the source of some top-performing stocks lately. Eight chip-sector stocks are now on the IBD 50 list of top-performing companies.Conversely, Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 black-eye could drive more business to Apple's (AAPL) iPhone family, Pacific Crest said.Canaccord Genuity analyst Michael Walkley said the Galaxy Note 7 recall will have a ""slight impact to near-term estimates"" for Qualcomm.Qualcomm stock, which touched a four-month high above 70 on Sept. 30, slipped 3 cents in the stock market today to close at 66.06. Synaptics stock rose a fraction Wednesday, while Maxim and Qorvo each fell a fraction.In his research report on Qualcomm, Walkley said, ""We are slightly lowering our MSM (mobile station modem) shipment estimates for the December and March quarters following the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 discontinuation of production, as Qualcomm supplies the higher ASP (average selling price) Snapdragon 820 (processor) for this smartphone.""Walkley reiterated his buy rating on Qualcomm stock and raised his price target to 75 from 70. He is bullish on Qualcomm's opportunities with Chinese handset makers, such as Vivo and Oppo. Walkley also is positive on Qualcomm's rumored interest in acquiring of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI).RELATED:Qualcomm Close To Giving Final Rose To NXP SemiconductorsApple Stock Rises On Price-Target Hike, Improved Sentiment

199,QRVO,"Apple (AAPL) rallied in the stock market today as reports signal the consumer tech giant’s iPhone production is on the rise.Taiwan’s Economic Daily said Apple told its iPhone 7 suppliers to produce 72 million to 78 million units this year, many more than the 65 million units Wall Street has projected. That production target is also the highest in about two years.The iPhone 7 is due out in September and could give Apple the boost it needs after the company reported its first-ever quarterly decline in iPhone sales last month.Shares closed up 1.3% in below-average volume, hitting their highest level in nearly a month. But the stock still has a lot of recovering to do after gapping down on its latest quarterly report, as it’s down about 27% from its 52-week high.Meanwhile, Apple chip suppliers Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM), Broadcom (AVGO), Qorvo (QRVO) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) are also getting a boost from the report.Taiwan Semiconductor rallied 1.5% in light turnover, but hit resistance at its 50-day line.

200,QRVO,"This week's insider trades include sales from executives at Tesla Motors (TSLA), Schlumberger (SLB), Apple (AAPL) supplier Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), Edwards Lifesciences (EW) and Continental Resources (CLR).Vice President of Engineering Douglas Field disclosed on Thursday that he sold 1,000 shares for $230 a share, or $230,916.Field was recruited by Tesla in 2013 from Apple, where he served as vice president of Mac Hardware engineering, to head the electric vehicle maker's new-car development program.The tech giants have engaged in what some have called a ""poaching war,"" hiring each other's executives. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has even dismissed Apple as a ""Tesla Graveyard,"" saying the iPhone maker hires people that Tesla fires.Electrek in April reported that Apple had hired former Tesla VP of Vehicle Engineering Chris Porritt for a ""special project,"" further fueling speculation that Apple is developing its own vehicle.Tesla Motors shares closed down 0.8% for the week, erasing solid gains, on reports that safety regulators are probing Tesla's suspension and the company's nondisclosure agreements.The oilfield services giant's CEO, Paal Kibsgaaard, on Monday disclosed the sale of 32,857 Schlumberger shares for $2.63 million, amid a rally in oil prices.The energy industry has been hit hard as oil and gas prices plunged the last couple of years, prompting Schlumberger and rivals Halliburton (HAL) and Baker Hughes (BHI) to cut tens of thousands of jobs.But the uptrend in oil has brought drilling back to life, with the U.S. oil rig count rising in recent weeks.Schlumberger shares are up 3.8% for the week.Chairman David Aldrich reported Thursday the sale of 15,000 shares of the Apple chip supplier in a transaction valued at about $1 million.Prior to being named chairman in May 2014, Aldrich had served as the company's chief executive since Skyworks was formed in 2002 via a merger between Alpha Industries, where he was president and CEO, and Conexant Systems.Citigroup downgraded Skyworks Thursday, saying that rival Qorvo (QRVO) is better positioned to grow. Citi cut its fiscal 2017 earnings per share view on Skyworks to 3% below consensus of $6.18, which would be $6.Skyworks shares are down 2.1% this week. Apple is up 0.9%.Chairman and CEO Michael Mussallem on Thursday reported selling 49,000 shares of the medical device maker and IBD 50 stock for about $5.05 million.Guggenheim Securities on Wednesday initiated coverage on Edwards with a neutral rating.

201,QRVO,"Apple (AAPL) supplier Broadcom (AVGO) likely gained another 20% in iPhone 7 content on top of continued increases in Samsung Galaxy smartphones, giving investors ""multiple ways to win,"" Credit Suisse analyst John Pitzer said Thursday.Broadcom is slated to report Q2 earnings on June 2 after the market close. Pitzer expects in-line Q2 sales, but he sees a ""significant EPS cushion"" on cost-cutting and synergies related to Broadcom's merger with the former Avago. In February, Avago completed its $37 billion acquisition of Broadcom, with the merged company taking the Broadcom name, in a deal the companies said gives the combined entity an enterprise value of $77 billion.For Q2, the consensus of 30 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expects Broadcom to report $3.55 billion in sales and $2.38 earnings per share minus items, up 116% and 12%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier quarter.On Wednesday, fellow Apple supplier Analog Devices (ADI) reported year-over-year sales declines for fiscal Q2 and guided to another 5% sales dip for its July quarter. Pitzer expects Broadcom's July-quarter sales view to likewise disappoint.But, like Analog Devices, Broadcom expects to grow its iPhone 7 content. Three months ago, CEO Hock Tan said Broadcom's radio-frequency (RF) content in smartphones has increased by 20% every year, and that this year will be no exception.Tan's view came before Apple reported its first-ever decline in iPhone sales, occurring in the March quarter.Pitzer sees Broadcom guiding to $3.39 billion in fiscal Q3 sales, below the consensus view for $3.72 billion. But he boosted his EPS-minus-items view to $2.64 from $2.51, matching the consensus model. For 2016 and 2017, he expects $11.16 and $12.86 EPS ex items, respectively.Wireless sales -- including sales to Apple -- have declined to 25% of total revenue from 50%. Less volatile data center sales now account for half of Broadcom's revenue, he wrote.""Broadcom's portfolio of businesses is significantly dampening the impact of any single headwind,"" he wrote in a research report. ""Broadcom can weather 'isolated storms' while maintaining the integrity of EPS upside.""Pitzer reiterated an outperform rating and a 180 price target on Broadcom stock. Broadcom shares fell a fraction, to 142.74, on the stock market today. RF rivals Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Qorvo (QRVO) fell 1.2% and a fraction, respectively.The trio fell amid fresh reports examining the effect slowing smartphone sales will have on chipmakers.
"
202,QRVO,"Apple (AAPL) and Huawei will take share from Samsung and Xiaomi within the Chinese smartphone market, leading to mass volatility and an inventory work-down for chipmakers like Broadcom (AVGO), Qorvo (QRVO) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), an MKM analyst predicted Wednesday.Shares of Broadcom, Qorvo and Skyworks were up a fraction each in early afternoon trading on the stock market today, while Apple stock was down a fraction. Last month, Apple reported March-quarter sales that missed views for the first time since 2003, undercutting chip stocks, which have broadly fallen since.The Apple report bolsters concerns of a smartphone slowdown, fresh off worries that Chinese smartphone saturation would stunt further growth. But, MKM analyst Ian Ing notes, the brimming Chinese market is still buying.Of 1,000 Chinese respondents in an MKM survey, more than 60% plan to buy a new smartphone within the next three to six months vs. less than 25% of U.S. respondents, Ing wrote in a research report. Of those in China, 38% plan to switch brands.""Chinese consumers are even more gadget-friendly relative to U.S. consumers,"" Ing wrote. ""Ownership is higher across smartphones, PCs and tablets in rank order.""Nearly 97% of Chinese consumers own a smartphone vs. 84% of Americans, but 25% of Chinese respondents plan to add another smartphone account -- likely expanding to children and the elderly -- vs. only 7.5% of Americans, Ing wrote, suggesting that Chinese users refresh their smartphones annually.Advances in wireless charging and fingerprint sensing will drive further adoption, he wrote.In smartphones, Apple, Huawei and LeTV look likely to take share from Xiaomi, Samsung and Lenovo, Ing wrote. Chinese consumers are more driven by brand (68% vs. 43% of Americans) and less by cost (33% vs. 61% of Americans).Those dramatic swings in share could affect chipmakers like Qorvo and Skyworks, which are 32% and 20% exposed to China, respectively. Ing estimates 40% of Qorvo's mobile sales stem from China. Fellow Apple suppliers Qualcomm (QCOM) and Broadcom are less exposed -- mid-teens and less than 10%, respectively, Ing said.""That said, Qorvo is favorably exposed to Huawei as a 10% customer,"" he noted.
"
203,QRVO,"Qorvo (QRVO) skirted Apple's (AAPL) iPhone shortfall by regaining Samsung Galaxy S7 share and riding the Chinese carrier aggregation trend, Needham analyst Quinn Bolton said Thursday after the chipmaker's blowout fiscal Q4.In morning trading on the stock market today, Qorvo stock was up 8%, trading near a three-week high above 48. But shares are down 12.5% year to date on Apple's weakness. Qorvo's largest customer -- widely assumed to be Apple -- accounts for a third of its total sales.Shares of rivals Broadcom (AVGO) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) were up a fraction Thursday morning, after Qorvo's fiscal Q4 beat late Wednesday. Last week, Skyworks topped fiscal Q2 expectations, but its fiscal Q3 sales guidance lagged by about $50 million, helping send its shares down 6.9%.For Qorvo, the March quarter wrapped up with $608.1 million in sales and $1.04 earnings per share minus items, beating the consensus of 20 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters for $599.2 million and 92 cents. Year over year, sales and EPS fell 4% and 6%.Current-quarter guidance for $650 million in sales and $1.05 EPS ex items was also ahead of analysts' views for $628.6 million and 96 cents, but that would be down 6% and 12% vs. the year-earlier quarter.On Thursday, at least four analysts boosted their price targets on Qorvo stock.Mobile sales declined 5% sequentially to $465 million, ""driven by content gains on the Galaxy S7 platform that mostly offset a 24% quarter-over-quarter decline in sales to its largest customer,"" Bolton wrote in a research report.Industrial and defense products rose 9% to $142 million in sales, also helping offset the hit from Apple, Bolton wrote. Bolton boosted his price target on Qorvo stock to 53 from 50 and reiterated his buy rating.Qorvo is ""outperforming smartphone peers with content and share gains,"" he said.Behind Apple, Samsung and Huawei are Qorvo's largest mobile customers, Qorvo CFO Steven Buhaly said on the company's earnings conference call late Wednesday. Qorvo ""took the medicine"" in December when Apple iPhone sales began slowing, he said.Outside Apple, mobile sales will be ""up significantly"" in the June quarter, Steven Creviston, Qorvo's president of mobile products, said on the call. He credited growth in China and the carrier aggregation trend for the likely growth.In that segment, sales to Chinese ODMs (original design manufacturers) account for 40% of revenue. Carrier aggregation in China is driving demand for Qorvo's radio-frequency chips, Qorvo CEO Robert Bruggeworth said on the call.Rosenblatt analyst Jun Zhang expects Qorvo to swipe Skyworks' share on that trend. At Taiwanese MediaTek, Skyworks accounts for 80%-85% of all LTE chipsets, Cowen analyst Timothy Arcuri wrote in a report. He, too, expects Qorvo to aggressively gain share, boosting his price target to 55 from 50 but keeping his market perform rating.
"
204,QRVO,"Qorvo (QRVO) sidestepped Apple's (AAPL) iPhone drag late Wednesday with a Wall Street-crushing fiscal Q4 earnings report, and with guidance that -- unlike rival Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) -- topped consensus expectations.In after-hours trading, Qorvo stock rocketed 7% after closing down 1.2% in Wednesday's regular session, and leading shares of radio-frequency rivals Skyworks and Broadcom (AVGO), whose stocks both rose a fraction.For its fiscal Q4 ended April 2, Qorvo reported $608.1 million in sales and $1.04 earnings per share minus items, down a respective 4% and 6% vs. the year-earlier quarter, but topping analysts' model for $599.2 million and 92 cents.Three months ago, Qorvo guided to $600 million and 90-95 cents.Qorvo ended fiscal 2016 with $2.61 billion in sales, up 53%, and $4.38 EPS ex items, down 8%. Sales edged the consensus of 20 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters for $2.6 billion, but EPS topped by 12 cents.Current-quarter guidance for $650 million in sales and $1.05 EPS minus items would be down 6% and 12% year over year, but that's ahead of analyst expectations for $628.6 million and 96 cents.Last week, Skyworks reported fiscal Q2 metrics that topped views, but shares crashed 6.9% on Q3 sales guidance that missed by about $50 million. Analysts called for a similar report from Qorvo, which is more heavily exposed to Apple's iPhone product cycle. Apple iPhone sales have slowed -- for the first time -- ahead of the iPhone 7 release expected in September.But all three RF suppliers will ramp up on the iPhone 7, Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari says.
"
205,QRVO,"Apple's (AAPL) iPhone drag will seize another victim Wednesday, a Goldman Sachs analyst suggested Tuesday, ahead of Qorvo's (QRVO) quarterly earnings report, with Wall Street forecasting the chipmaker's first year-over-year sales decline in eight quarters.But the Apple trough will likely resolve in the second half of the year, when the iPhone 7 ramps, Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari wrote in a research report. He expects radio-frequency chip rivals Qorvo, Broadcom (AVGO) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) to see growth from the release of the iPhone 7, expected in September.""While unit headwinds and inventory burn at Apple could weigh on results, we believe we are at the trough of the cycle and expect RF fundamental to improve,"" Hari wrote. ""The RF content growth story is still fully intact.""First, though, heavily-Apple-exposed Qorvo has to survive the March quarter, for which Apple reported its first-ever year-over-year decline in smartphone sales.For Qorvo's fiscal Q4, the consensus of 20 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters models $599.2 million in sales and 92 cents earnings per share minus items, down a respective 6% and 17% vs. the year-earlier quarter. Qorvo reports after the close Wednesday.Three months ago, Qorvo guided to $600 million in sales and 90-95 cents EPS ex items. Qorvo's sales and EPS have decelerated for the past three and four quarters, respectively. Last quarter, EPS fell for the first time since September 2012.For the fiscal year, Qorvo is expected to report 52% sales growth, to $2.6 billion. But analyst consensus calls for a 10% decline in EPS ex items, to $4.26.In the stock market today, Qorvo stock rose a fraction to 45.04, while Broadcom fell 2% and Skyworks fell a fraction.Last week, Skyworks' fiscal Q2 metrics topped analysts' consensus, but Q3 guidance missed. Then, Skyworks stock dropped 6.9%. Hari says Qorvo stock could experience a similar dip. But Qorvo shares are already down 12% over the past 12 months, and ""weakness may not be as pronounced,"" he wrote.Hari cut his price target on Qorvo stock to 44 from 47 but kept his neutral rating. He trimmed his Broadcom stock price target to 171 from 175, but he still rates it and Skyworks both a buy.Among the three, Qorvo is the most Apple-exposed, Hari wrote.""We expect investors to focus on its (fiscal Q1) guide (impact of Apple fallout) and execution (share gains at Samsung),"" he wrote.

208,QRVO,"U.K.-based chipmaker Dialog Semiconductor late Wednesday reported better-than-expected preliminary sales figures for the third quarter, providing a positive data point on its largest customer, Apple (AAPL).Dialog said it expects third-quarter revenue of about $345 million. That's 13% above the midpoint of its July guidance and 5% above Q3 2015 sales. The results are driven primarily by smartphones, RBC analyst Mitch Steves said in a research report.Dialog said some mobile system orders were pulled into Q3 from Q4 to accommodate a public holiday in China, Steves said.Apple represents about 75% to 80% of Dialog's annual sales, he said. Dialog provides power management chips for the iPhone and other devices.Dialog is slated to post its Q3 earnings report on Nov. 3.IBD'S TAKE: Apple supports a large ecosystem of component suppliers, including Dialog, whose shares are traded in Europe but not the U.S. Among U.S.-traded chip companies that supply Apple, Broadcom is one of the top performers. Broadcom is No. 26 on the IBD 50 list of superior stocks.Other chip suppliers with outsized exposure to Apple business include Broadcom (AVGO), Cirrus Logic (CRUS), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Qorvo (QRVO).Apple stock rose 0.8% to 113.91 on the stock market today. Shares continue to hold over a 110.33 buy point crossed on Sept. 14.RBC analyst Amit Daryanani on Wednesday reiterated his outperform rating on Apple stock, with a price target of 125.""We think today's Dialog pre-announcement, in addition to several positive data points from the iPhone 7 launch, should provide investors with comfort heading into (Apple's) September quarter print,"" Daryanani said. Apple is scheduled to report September-quarter sales on Oct. 27.Positive data points for Apple include encouraging reports from wireless carriers on iPhone demand, potential share gains from Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 battery problems, and a mix shift toward premium models of the iPhone 7, he said.Credit Suisse analyst Kulbinder Garcha said the Dialog news implies strong iPhone sales.The majority of Dialog's improved sales likely came from stronger iPhone business, supporting the thesis for a better-than-expected iPhone 7 cycle, he said in a report.

209,QRVO,"Garcha reiterated his outperform rating on Apple stock with a price target of 150.Meanwhile, Canaccord Genuity analyst Michael Walkley on Wednesday maintained his buy rating on Apple stock, with a price target of 140.""Based on our surveys, we believe demand for the new iPhone 7 products remains healthy with ongoing strong mix to higher"" average-selling-price models, he said in a report.Walkley raised his December-quarter iPhone sales estimate to 76.5 million from 75 million.""Between the aggressive U.S. carrier promotions, favorable premium-tier competitive environment due to the continued Galaxy Note 7 battery issues, improved iPhone 7 features and functionality, and stronger-than-anticipated initial consumer demand, we believe initial iPhone 7 sales continue to trend positively,"" he said.RELATED:Apple Prepping For Ambient Computing Era, The Next Paradigm ShiftGoogle's Pixel A 'Science Project,' Called A 'Nonevent' For Apple

211,QRVO,"Apple (AAPL) stock fell 1.7% on Friday after news reports citing GfK data pointed to weak iPhone 7 sales in Europe.Apple shares closed on the stock market today at 112.71, down 1.9% for the week. Apple dipped to 112.25 in after-hours trading.The stock remains above a 110.33 buy point cleared on Sept. 14.Barron's, CNBC and others reported that market research firm GfK put out a note saying first-weekend sales of the iPhone 7 in Europe were down 25% compared with the iPhone 6S launch last year.GfK confirmed the existence of the report, but would not divulge its contents, saying the data was exclusive for subscribers.IBD'S TAKE: Apple isn't the only company affected by iPhone sales. Many semiconductor and component suppliers see their fortunes rise and fall on Apple business. One such chip supplier, Broadcom, is on the IBD 50 list of top-performing companies.Apple broke with its tradition of providing first-weekend iPhone sales this year. It claimed the statistic means little since it is more a factor of supply than demand.In fact, Apple did not have any models of the new iPhone 7 Plus or jet-black models of the standard iPhone 7 in stores at launch on Sept. 16. It quickly sold out of its initial production run of those models during preorders, which began a week earlier.The GfK news also pulled down leading Apple chip suppliers.Broadcom (AVGO) dropped 1.3% to 166.65 on the stock market today. Cirrus Logic (CRUS) tumbled 5.1% to 52.39. Qorvo (QRVO) dipped 2.9% to 54.87. Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) slid 2.8% to 74.77.Also weighing on Apple shares Friday was a Reuters report that Japanese regulators are considering taking antitrust action against the technology giant. Regulators are considering charging Apple for possible violations that might have helped it dominate smartphone sales in the country.RELATED:Apple Loses 2% For The Week As Facebook, Alphabet Test Buy PointsIntel Inside iPhone 7; Chipmaker Wins Apple Business
"
212,QRVO,"Helped by unexpectedly high demand for the new iPhone, Apple (AAPL) chip supplier Cirrus Logic (CRUS) over the past week has executed a textbook example of an upside stock reversal.Signs of a reversal include a downturn followed by a quick rebound, often off a key test of support like the 50-day line, with low trading volume on the down days but high volume on the good ones. For intrepid investors, such movement can represent an opportunity to buy at a discount. For others, it can offer a reason to keep calm and not cash out.Cirrus Logic's stock on July 28 jumped nearly 20%, a day after the company reported strong quarterly earnings and gave a forecast that an analyst said suggested more iPhone 7 business from Apple.Cirrus trended higher from there, then began a losing streak on Aug. 22, punctuated by last Friday's 6% dive amid a broader sell-off spurred by Fed rate-hike concerns. But aside from the Sept. 9 drop, the stock's down days during that time saw lower-than-average volume.On Monday, Cirrus initially fell further, but found support at its 50-day line, and reversed higher to close up 2.5% in strong volume. It edged lower Tuesday, again in weak volume, and shot up 4.3% Wednesday and 7.6% Thursday in heavy volume.IBD'S TAKE: As stocks get batted around and concerns persist about stalling growth, learn more about how to navigate a sideways market.Cirrus fell 0.6% to 54.82 on the stock market today in above-average volume but well off session lows.That could be due to profit-taking, as Apple is also down 0.6%, also off Friday's low. Shares of other Apple suppliers like Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Qorvo (QRVO) fell 1.2% and 1.4%, respectively, after similarly strong rallies.Friday is also a quadruple witching day, when index options, index futures, stock options and stock futures all expire at the same time, often producing unusual volatility.Still, Cirrus Logic's Relative Strength rating has remained strong, at 97 out of a best-possible 99, and its Accumulation/Distribution rating is B+, indicating net buying by institutional investors.RELATED:Apple Stock Gets Price-Target Hikes As iPhone 7 Goes On Sale Buying Early But Buying Smart With Stock ReversalsSmart Chart Reading: Look For Key Reversals, Shakeouts

213,QRVO,"The rumored merger of Qualcomm (QCOM) and NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) has received an upbeat response from Wall Street analysts.The possible deal, reported to be in the works by Dow Jones on Thursday, would create the second-largest chip company by revenue after Intel (INTC).Qualcomm stock ended trading up 1.6% to close at 68.50 on the stock market today. On Thursday, it rose 6.3%.NXP stock soared to a 6.1% gain to 102.01 and at a 15-month high, after jumping 17% Thursday.IBD'S TAKE: Big mergers come with big risks, and many never pan out. An example of a huge deal that so far is working out is Broadcom's $37 billion acquisition of Avago Technologies, completed Feb. 1. Broadcom currently ranks No. 39 on the IBD 50 list of top-performing public companies. More than that, Broadcom is among IBD's Sector Leaders.Investment bank Mizuho raised its rating on Qualcomm stock to buy from neutral, with a price target of 75.Cowen hiked its price target on Qualcomm to 74 from 62 and reiterated its outperform rating.A Qualcomm-NXP merger ""could be truly transformational,"" Cowen analyst Timothy Arcuri said in a research report.""We love this potential deal. Hopefully it happens,"" Arcuri said. ""We've been writing about it for about 12 months.""An acquisition of NXP would help Qualcomm diversify beyond mobile phone chips. The deal would give Qualcomm exposure to the automotive, industrial and Internet of Things markets, Arcuri said.The only other potential bidder for NXP would be Broadcom (AVGO), Arcuri said. But Xilinx (XLNX) would be a better acquisition for Broadcom to make, he said.Purchasing NXP would allow Qualcomm to become an end-to-end chip supplier to the automotive market.""Qualcomm dominates automotive telematics and we believe the potential acquisition of NXP will give it in-cockpit market share, powertrain, safety, and an automotive processor portfolio from Freescale Semiconductor that creates the first end-to-end semiconductor auto supplier of the future,"" Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh said in a report.Rakesh also reiterated his buy rating on NXP, with a price target of 120.Qualcomm acquiring NXP would make strategic sense, Credit Suisse analyst Kulbinder Garcha said in a report. But a large acquisition would be uncharacteristic of Qualcomm, he said.""Management has mentioned on a number of occasions that they gravitate toward smaller, tuck-in acquisitions,"" Garcha said.Qualcomm's two largest acquisitions to date were its $2.4 billion purchase of CSR in 2015 and $3.1 billion purchase of Atheros Communications in 2011. By comparison, NXP has a market capitalization of about $35 billion.Qualcomm is considering other acquisition targets as well, Garcha said. They could include Mellanox (MLNX), Xilinx, Qorvo (QRVO), Cavium (CAVM) and Silicon Laboratories (SLAB).Garcha rates Qualcomm stock as outperform, with a price target of 70.RELATED:NXP Semiconductors Rockets On Qualcomm Acquisition Report

214,QRVO,"Broadcom (AVGO) will likely gain 20% content in Apple's (AAPL) iPhone 7, but its fiscal Q3 success will rely on better demand for switching and storage products, Pacific Crest analyst John Vinh predicted Friday.Fiscal Q4 guidance, however, could be ""muted"" on Apple's slower iPhone 7 ramp vs. its iPhone 6S predecessor, Vinh wrote in a research report. But storage and switching will offset that risk, and M&A cost synergies will help the bottom line, he said.The consensus of 30 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expects Broadcom to report $3.76 billion in sales and $2.77 earnings per share ex items, up a respective 115% and 24% vs. the year-earlier period. Broadcom is slated to report July-quarter results after the close Thursday.Broadcom's massive year-over-year growth follows its $37 billion merger with former Avago Technologies in February. Analysts predict Broadcom is far from finished with M&A activities.Vinh kept his overweight rating and 180 price target on Broadcom stock. He predicts Broadcom won three chips in the iPhone 7 and could benefit from the burgeoning carrier aggregation trend in which infrastructure is built out to support LTE and 5G.Other chipmakers like Cirrus Logic (CRUS), Qorvo (QRVO) and Synaptics (SYNA) won't be as lucky, Pacific Crest analysts wrote in a separate report Friday. Apple is expected to cut component orders 15%-20% year over year, said Pacific Crest.But Broadcom, InvenSense (INVN) and Analog Devices (ADI) will buoy on other trends, analysts say.Vinh sees an in-line to slightly better Q3 and slightly down Q4 guidance for Broadcom, reflecting the muted Apple cycle. But the bottom line will survive as Broadcom digests February's merger.Friday, Broadcom stock touched an all-time high for the fourth day of the week, peaking at 178.65. Shares are up more than 20% this year.IBD'S TAKE: Broadcom is ranked first in IBD's 41-company Electronic-Semiconductor Fabless industry group. It's also an IBD 50 stock.RELATED:These Three Chipmakers Will Survive Apple's Rumored 15%-20% iPhone 7 Order CutBendgate Repeated?

219,QRVO,"Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) is ""rebuilding"" after Apple's (AAPL) iPhone flop last quarter but is still looking at double-digit growth in the second half of 2016, MKM analyst Ian Ing wrote in a research note after Apple-supplier stocks broadly toppled last week, when the iPhone maker reported its first-ever year-over-year decline in smartphone sales.Monday, Skyworks stock rose a fraction, as did shares of radio-frequency chip rival Broadcom (AVGO). Another rival, Qorvo (QRVO), fell a fraction. Apple stock slipped a fraction Monday, to 93.64, and it's down 10.3% since reporting its March-quarter earnings after the close Tuesday.That day, Apple reported not only its first-ever year-over-year drop in iPhone sales, but also its first quarterly revenue decrease in 13 years. Skyworks' Q2 guidance, released late Thursday, slugged that stock when its sales view missed by $50 million.But after just 2% sales growth last quarter, Skyworks expects double-digit growth in September, though strength in China and with Samsung might not be enough to outweigh an ""unfavorable"" year-over-year iPhone comparison. Last September, Apple sold 13 million iPhone 6S units in three days following the release.Chinese smartphone-makers are facing a largely saturated market, Ing noted. About 45% of China's mobile phones are on 4G now. Wall Street largely expects a pause as the industry transitions to 5G -- but that refresh is still more than a year away.Ing retained his buy rating on Skyworks stock, but he cut the price target to 93 from 98. At least two other analysts rated Skyworks a buy over the weekend.

The electric car maker late Wednesday reported an adjusted loss of 57 cents a share, slightly better than views.On the IBD 50, AMN Healthcare Services (AHS) rebounded with a 5% gain in brisk trade after falling to its 50-day line Wednesday. PRA Health Sciences (PRAH) found support at its 50-day average and bounced 5%, also in heavy trade.Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM) was the biggest IBD 50 loser, gapping down to fall 9% in rapid turnover to its 200-day line. The stock had been forming a flat base prior to the drop. The natural foods grocery chain reported Q1 earnings that topped but sales that missed views.In economic news, initial jobless claims rose to 274,000 last week, up from 257,000 the prior week. Economists expected 262,000 claims. Layoffs rose 6% to more than 65,000 in April, up 35% from job cuts in March, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas.

221,QRVO,"Tesla Motors (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk's pledge to make 1 million electric cars by 2020 could be a boon for chipmakers clobbered by the first decline in sales of Apple's (AAPL) iPhone, a major hit product that fueled growth for many Apple suppliers since 2007.Now, hunger for the next growth vector has many chipmakers eyeing the automotive and Internet of Things markets, even as smartphones will remain a key profit center for some semiconductor companies.""I view the IoT market as a massive opportunity, and the autonomous vehicle is a part of that,"" Edward Jones analyst Bill Kreher told IBD. ""Over time, this market will experience widespread adoption. Simply, the promise of greater productivity will drive demand over the long run.""The deck is always reshuffled every few years and always to the most innovative technology. We think the IoT is the next battleground.""Kreher expects the IoT industry overall, including automotive, to grow 10% to 15% annually in the next three years.Sensor makers like Analog Devices (ADI), NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) and Texas Instruments (TXN); analog chipmakers like MaxLinear (MXL) and Maxim Integrated Devices (MXIM); and graphics-chip companies like Nvidia (NVDA) are among those seen as especially primed in these fields.But not everyone is as hot on the Internet of Things. Robert Maire, president of tech research and consulting firm Semiconductor Advisers, calls today's cars ""PCs on wheels"" and ""smartphones on steroids,"" but he says other IoT fields typically use cheaper chips than the higher-end chips powering smartphones.Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) CEO David Aldrich said in April that the IoT opportunity is ""measured in the tens of billions of units,"" but Maire says that doesn't mean huge revenue growth.""It won't be the Internet of Things (replacing smartphones), because Internet of Things is based on typically trailing-edge semiconductor technology,"" Maire told IBD. ""About $5 worth of semiconductors go into an Internet-connected thermostat that sells for $75-$100.""The Qualcomm (QCOM) chip content alone in Apple's iPhone 6 has been estimated at $20 to $22 per unit by teardown specialist iFixit.But companies such as Qualcomm and Integrated Device Technology (IDTI) are looking beyond the smartphone era to a future dominated by smarter cities, smarter devices and smarter cars -- and are eagerly watching efforts by tech heavyweights Tesla, Apple and Google (GOOGL) to make it happen.Still, estimating the size of the IoT chip market is like a game of pin the tail on the donkey. The numbers are high but cover a lot of ground.Last year, research firm McKinsey pegged revenue for the total IoT market at $3.9 trillion to $11.1 trillion a year by 2025. At the highest end, that means IoT could account for more than 10% of the total world economy.In April, Business Insider estimated there will be 24 billion IoT-connected devices by 2020. More than $6 trillion will be invested in IoT solutions over the next five years, the online news site's Business Intelligence research unit estimates.Many of Apple's chip suppliers want a bite of IoT, but not all. Broadcom (AVGO) in April sold its Internet of Things unit to Cypress Semiconductor (CY) for $550 million. The unit generated just $189 million in revenue in the past 12 months, 3% of Broadcom's total sales.Broadcom declined to comment on the IoT unit's sale or on slowing smartphone sales. In its fiscal Q1 ended Jan. 31, Broadcom reported that its wireless business (which includes smartphone sales) pulled in $578 million in sales, about a third of total revenue. MKM analyst Ian Ing estimates 10% of Broadcom's mobile sales stem from smartphone-saturated China.Qorvo (QRVO) and Skyworks, Broadcom's rival makers of the radio-frequency chips that go inside smartphones, are buying into the IoT market -- Qorvo doing so literally with its April acquisition of IoT supplier GreenPeak. GreenPeak makes ultra-low-power, short-range wireless chips for smart homes.The acquisition should help Qorvo diversify. Qorvo didn't return requests for comment about slowing smartphone sales. For its fiscal Q4 ended April 2, Qorvo's mobile product sales accounted for $465 million, or about 76%, of total revenue.As for Skyworks, its integrated mobile systems and power amplifiers segments accounted for 73% of its total sales last quarter. Apple's iPhone 6S uses two Skyworks power amplifier modules, teardowns show.But Skyworks' broad markets division, which includes IoT-related sales, grew 18% vs. the year-earlier quarter and made up 25% of sales, Aldrich said on the company's earnings conference call in April. He estimated the IoT opportunity growing at an 83% compound annual growth rate through 2020.Apple Watch and Samsung Galaxy supplier Integrated Device Technology acknowledges the smartphone slowdown but says its future is in wireless charging. IDT's chips are used inside portable devices to enable wireless charging, which will become ever more important as Apple reportedly prepares to eliminate wired charging entirely from the iPhone 8 in 2017.IDT is about 17% exposed to the mobile market, CTO Sailesh Chittipeddi told IBD.Smartphones have reached a saturation point. But not every piece of accompanying technology has peaked, Chittipeddi said. RF suppliers Broadcom, Qorvo and Skyworks also say that while unit shipments might stagnate, dollar content will grow. In January, Broadcom CEO Hock Tan said RF content has grown 20%-plus every year regardless the number of units shipped.Qualcomm -- doubly exposed through its chip sales and licensing business -- is also bullish on continued growth of its smartphone business. The breadth of technology on a smartphone will only continue to grow, CEO Steven Mollenkopf told analysts during the company's February analyst day.""The smartphone ecosystem is going to continue to grow, as wireless charging penetration of that market continues to increase,"" Chittipeddi told IBD. ""People still sell over 1.2 billion smartphones per year and not every one of them today has wireless charging.""And there are other demands for wireless charging. In March, IDT hosted a Hackster challenge, instructing participants to come up with new uses for wireless charging. Er Bharath Ram came up with an on-the-go coffee maker, beating out oddities like a tiny remote-controlled tank, a ""magic toothbrush"" and shoes for Alzheimer's sufferers.""Furniture, automotive applications, headsets, warmers, drones ... will provide growth,"" Chittipeddi said, though he concedes not as much growth as a new, high-volume smartphone.Last year, IDT expanded into sensors with the $310 million acquisition of ZMDI, Chittipeddi said. IDT plans to leverage that sensor business within the burgeoning automotive and infotainment market competing against NXP Semiconductors.About the same time IDT wrapped its ZMDI acquisition, NXP finished up its nearly $13 billion purchase of Freescale Semiconductors. NXP now boasts a $28.5 billion market cap to IDT's $2.7 billion. NXP CEO Rick Clemmer estimates 40% of his company's sales stem from the automotive segment.Clemmer says NXP spotted the smartphone's deceleration well ahead of time. Although, like Chittipeddi, he still sees growth for specialized smartphone tech. NXP chips are used to encrypt mobile payments for systems like Apple Pay, Samsung Wallet or Google Wallet.""Maybe 15% to 20% of smartphones have mobile wallets (and) we think that can go up to 60%,"" he said. ""We see a tripling of our volume because of the increased share that has the mobile wallet technology.""Buying Freescale helped de-emphasize mobile. In Q1, NXP's $471 million in secure connected devices (mobile) accounted for 21% of sales. But Clemmer says that exposure, on average, is about 15%. It also allowed the combined company to become the top automotive chip player, he says.NXP is also working with Tesla, Google, Apple and  Ford (F) as they work to develop self-driving cars, Clemmer says, another key push for NXP.That automotive opportunity will be huge, says Nvidia's director of automotive, Danny Shapiro. In April, Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang unveiled a trio of autonomous cars code-named BB8, C3PO and R2D2 -- a riff on the popular ""Star Wars"" franchise.Like NXP, Nvidia has developed an autonomous-driving platform for carmakers. Unlike NXP, Nvidia only briefly dabbled in smartphones for which graphics only need to be ""good enough,"" Shapiro told IBD. Nvidia, he says, is angling for the bleeding edge of tech.So, no smartphone chips from Nvidia. ""There's no value there for us,"" Shapiro said. But ""I believe the car will be the most powerful computer you will ever own. ... We've moved beyond the graphics in your vehicles to being able to process the data. And for that, you need a supercomputer.""

222,QRVO,"Apple's (AAPL) late-2015 implosion on stifled iPhone demand won't be repeated this December when the Cupertino, Calif., giant launches its newest flagship handset, Analog Devices (ADI) CEO Vincent Roche said Wednesday during the Force Touch chipmaker's fiscal Q3 earnings conference call.In January, Analog Devices stock was caught in Apple's iPhone 6S tornado, which saw chip suppliers like Qorvo (QRVO) and Cirrus Logic (CRUS) guiding down their December-quarter sales forecasts on weaker-than-expected iPhone demand.""This year, I think we have a closer linkage between supply and demand here on the consumer side,"" Roche told analysts. ""So I would expect us to decline seasonally in the first quarter, but only seasonally.""On Thursday, analysts were mixed on Analog Devices' fiscal Q3, which was largely a blowout but showed some lumpiness in its non-consumer segments (79% of total sales). Non-consumer sales rose 4% vs. last year, outplaying peers' 3.5% growth, analysts said. It was the first time it topped its rivals in five quarters.But, Credit Suisse analyst John Pitzer noted, fiscal Q4 guidance for 3.5% business-to-business growth is below rivals' average view for 5% growth. Pitzer, though, sees growing opportunities in automotive and share gains in communications infrastructure.Still, Analog Devices pulled in about $120 million in sales to Apple amid the iPhone 7 ramp, up from $30 million in fiscal Q2, Pitzer wrote in a research report. For the current quarter, he expects that segment's sales to jump to $190 million. It sells chips that enable Apple's Force Touch feature, which senses how much pressure a user is putting on a display surface and then reacts based on the level of pressure.Nomura analyst Romit Shah is less bullish on Force Touch than is Credit Suisse's Pitzer. He estimates Force Touch sales hit $99 million in fiscal Q3, but that was well ahead of his earlier $55 million view. For fiscal Q4, he models $168 million in sales to Apple.Shah remained neutral on Analog Devices stock and kept his 70 price target. Pitzer is restricted on the stock, as Credit Suisse is helping with the company's $14.8 billion merger with rival Linear Technology (LLTC).On its earnings conference call Wednesday, Analog Devices confirmed 30% content growth in its consumer segment, widely believed to be comprised solely of Apple. Teardowns show Analog Devices supplies its Force Touch controller for the iPhone 6S.Analog Devices shareholders tend to shy away from the volatile consumer segment, which comprised 21% of sales in fiscal Q3. But Analog Devices' planned merger with Linear Technology should cut that exposure significantly.IBD'S TAKE: Analysts expect Analog Devices to cut its Apple exposure to 5%, or by a third, based on varying estimates. That would appease traders who bet bigger on less-volatile non-consumer sales.Plus, B. Riley analyst Craig Ellis noted, gross margins hit 66%, 20 basis points better than expected despite the consumer mix. Consumer sales grew 131% sequentially in fiscal Q3, but declined 10% vs. the year-earlier quarter. In fiscal Q4, they are expected to fall 20% year over year, Credit Suisse's Pitzer said.""It shows Force Touch revenue quality is better than many perceive,"" Ellis wrote in a research report. ""And it's another sign there's no big change in Apple iPhone component pricing."" Ellis kept his buy rating on Analog Devices stock and boosted his price target to 74 from 73.In morning trading on the stock market today, Analog Devices stock fell 0.1% to 64.13. Apple also dipped 0.1%, to 109.08.

The Galaxy Note 7 touts an Apple iPhone 6S-quashing battery. But its power falls short of the Galaxy S7 Edge.Among Qualcomm's offerings -- a processor, an audio codec, two radio-frequency chips and two power management chips. Fellow RF Qorvo chipmaker brings three chips to the mix: a high-band RF fusion module, a front-end module and a receiver.IBD'S TAKE: Dot-com boom darling Qualcomm sports a fast-growing dividend. Check out IBD's Dividend Leaders.Broadcom has at least one confirmed chip, but its Wi-Fi system-on-a-chip is also likely contained within Samsung's Wi-Fi module, iFixit found. Samsung itself supplies two other chips for flash memory and dynamic random-access memory (DRAM).Integrated Device Technology supplied a wireless power receiver, an iteration of the component it supplies for the Apple Watch.The chipset is nearly identical to those of the S7 and S7 Edge, iFixit found. The Note 7 scored a four out of a best-possible 10 in repairability. Many of the components can be replaced independently, but the chassis is vulnerable to cracking.Noted iFixit, ""Because of the curved screen, replacing the front glass without destroying the display is probably impossible.""In afternoon tradingIntegrated Device Technology stock closed up 3.25% on the stock market today, and Qorvo rose 1.2%.

225,QRVO,"Apple (AAPL) chip suppliers Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), Cirrus Logic (CRUS) and Qorvo (QRVO) stocks lifted Monday on a bullish RBC Capital report that sees fellow chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO) reaching $16 earnings per share on merger synergies and iPhone 7 content gains.But Broadcom's Q2 wireless sales will likely dip $40 million to $50 million on slowing current-generation iPhone sales, RBC Capital analyst Amit Daryanani wrote in the research report. He rates Broadcom stock his top semiconductor pick, with a 180 price target.Over the next two years, Broadcom stock could reach 200, Daryanani says.In afternoon trading on the stock market today, Broadcom stock was up nearly 1% to 148.10. But it trailed shares of InvenSense (INVN) and Qorvo, which jumped 2.8% to 5.98 and 2% to 50.40, respectively. Cirrus Logic, Skyworks and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) stocks were up 2.8%, 1.9% and 1.5%, respectively.NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) stock was up 0.6%, while Integrated Device Technology (IDTI) was up a fraction.Broadcom is slated to report its Q2 earnings after the close June 2. Daryanani expects Broadcom to miss consensus expectations for $3.55 billion in sales on petering Apple iPhone sales, despite stronger-than-expected Samsung Galaxy S7 sales.Apple comprises 15% of Broadcom's sales, Daryanani estimates, with Samsung in the high single digits. Apple's June-quarter guidance implies 40 million iPhones shipped vs. consensus views for 44 million. Near term, Apple will pose a headwind until the iPhone 7, expected to be released in September, ramps up.""To that end, Broadcom's FBAR (film bulk acoustic resonator) business could see double-digit year-over-year growth driven by content gains,"" Daryanani wrote. Wi-Fi combo chips could also see modest average sales prices tailwinds.Earlier, Broadcom saw wireless account for 23% of sales. Daryanani expects that segment to grow 37% quarter over quarter as the company's recent merger is factored. The former Avago Technologies bought Broadcom for $37 million in February, but kept the Broadcom name.Storage sales will likely become ""incrementally worse,"" Daryanani wrote. Western Digital (WDC) and Seagate Technologies' (STX) recent earnings suggest a $100 million hard-disk drive total addressable market in March and a $95 million TAM in June, down 20% and 15% vs. last year.Enterprise storage is expected to account for 17% of Broadcom's Q2 sales.

226,QRVO,"Apple (AAPL) stock rose Monday as investors digested a positive iPhone 7 production report, along with a cautionary article that suggested Apple was at risk of becoming the next BlackBerry (BBRY).Apple stock rose 1.3% Monday, to 96.43, on the stock market today.Taiwan’s Economic Daily News reported Monday that Apple has ordered contract manufacturers to produce 72 million to 78 million iPhone 7 handsets this year, a record figure for a new iPhone and above analyst estimates of 65 million units.The iPhone 7 is expected to be released in September, with a slimmer design, faster processor and improved camera as compared to earlier iPhones. This 10th-generation iPhone might even sport a waterproof design for the first time.Meanwhile, influential tech blogger and Web developer Marco Arment on Saturday posted an article that argued Apple is falling behind Amazon.com (AMZN), Facebook (FB) and Alphabet (GOOGL)-owned Google in artificial intelligence (AI), digital assistants and voice interfaces. He said Apple could miss the next big shift in computing, just as onetime cellphone giant BlackBerry missed the move to smartphones from email-centric feature phones.""Amazon, Facebook, and Google -- especially Google -- have all invested heavily in Big Data Web services and AI for many years, prioritizing them highly, iterating and advancing them constantly, accumulating relevant data, developing effective algorithms and attracting, developing and retaining tons of specialized talent,"" Arment wrote.Arment says Apple is not putting the same emphasis on Big Data and AI as its rivals.“Becoming a major Big Data AI services company doesn’t happen completely in secret and suddenly get released to the world, completed, in a keynote,” Arment said. “It’s a massive undertaking, spanning many years, many people and a lot of noticeable interaction with the world. It’s easier to conceal the development of an entire car than a major presence in AI and services.”Investors on Monday were more focused on the Economic Daily News article and a trio of reassuring analyst reports.Pacific Crest Securities analyst Andy Hargreaves on Sunday reiterated his overweight rating on Apple stock with a price target of 123.“We believe concerns about a potential lack of innovation in the iPhone 7 underestimate the extraordinary growth in the user base over the past two years, which is likely to drive increased replacement volume and overall iPhone unit growth in fiscal 2017, almost regardless of the hardware,” Hargreaves said.BMO Capital Markets analyst Tim Long also is positive on Apple because of the potential for iPhone users to upgrade with the iPhone 7 cycle.“What we find most interesting is that we believe we are entering the iPhone 7 cycle with the highest percentage of phones in the installed base at least two years old, at about 26% (compared to 23% for iPhone 6),” Long said. “This translates to about 120 million phones. As a result, we believe the device will drive an improved replacement rate, even if it has lackluster features.”Also, the huge growth in used iPhone sales will increase the installed base of iPhone users and boost services revenue, Long said. He reiterated his outperform rating on Apple stock, with a price target of 117.Nomura analyst Jeffrey Kvaal maintained his buy rating on Apple with a price target of 120. He noted the success of Apple’s recent iPhone SE launch but cautioned that the lower-cost smartphone could cannibalize sales of iPhone 6S handsets.Apple chip suppliers Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Qorvo (QRVO) each rose 2% Monday.

Shares of competitors Broadcom and Qorvo were down a respective 1.5% and 1.75%.NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), Qualcomm (QCOM) and InvenSense (INVN) stocks followed, down 0.7%, 3.1% and 5.65%, respectively.Apple itself lost 1.15%, trading near its lowest levels since mid-2014.For its fiscal Q2, which ended April 1, Skyworks reported $775.1 million in sales and $1.25 earnings per share minus items, in line and topping the consensus of 25 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters for $775.6 million and $1.24.But EPS slipped to single-digit growth for the first time in 13 quarters, rising 9% year over year. Sales rose 2%, in the single-digit range for the first time in 14 quarters. Both metrics have decelerated for five consecutive quarters.Current-quarter guidance for $750 million in sales and $1.21 EPS ex items would be down 7% and 10%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier quarter. On a year-over-year basis, sales have never declined in the past five years. EPS has declined twice, but this quarter's decline would be the biggest.And both metrics lagged the consensus for $800.5 million and $1.32.Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh blamed the ""iPhone drag"" for Skyworks' weak guidance. On Tuesday, Apple reported its first year-over-year decline in iPhone sales and its first quarterly revenue drop in 13 years.Apple CEO Tim Cook said Tuesday that the company planned to cut channel inventories in the June quarter ""in light of the macroeconomic environment."" Late Tuesday, supplier Cirrus Logic (CRUS) offered Q3 guidance that also missed Wall Street views.But Skyworks expects a strong September quarter, with 20% and 40% content gains at Samsung and Huawei. On average, Chinese smartphones are growing content by 20% year over year, Rakesh wrote in a research report.Rakesh cut his price target on Skyworks stock to 99 from 105 but reiterated a buy rating.Cowen analyst Timothy Arcuri estimates that 40 million to 50 million iPhones will be sold in the June quarter, leading to better upside in Skyworks' fiscal Q4. But he adds that Qorvo might be a stronger RF competitor now.Both analysts suggest that Skyworks look to diversify amid the slowing Chinese and iPhone markets. Arcuri reduced his price target on Skyworks stock to 76 from 78 and kept his market perform rating.

229,QRVO,"Cirrus Logic (CRUS) stock dodged Apple’s (AAPL) tornado Wednesday, while shares of Apple suppliers Broadcom (AVGO), Qorvo (QRVO) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) fell on Apple's first ever year-over-year decline in iPhone sales.In midday trading on the stock market today, Cirrus Logic stock bounded 6.5%, near 36, after the chipmaker late Tuesday posted fiscal Q4 metrics that declined vs. the year-earlier quarter but still topped Wall Street expectations. The results were similar to fellow Apple supplier NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), which late Monday reported consensus-topping Q1 earnings that also fell year over year.Cirrus Logic's current-quarter guidance lagged analyst consensus on softening iPhone sales. Late Tuesday, Apple said that it had shipped 51.19 million iPhones in the March quarter, down 16% from the year-earlier quarter.Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill cut estimates on Apple suppliers Skyworks and Qorvo ahead of their earnings reports, slated for after the market close Wednesday. Apple's June-quarter revenue guide for $41 million to $43 million implies 38 million iPhone shipments, Gill wrote in a research report.Analyst consensus currently estimates 44 million iPhone shipments for the June quarter, he wrote.""While we expect iPhone unit shipments to grow seasonally beyond the June quarter, we believe overall shipment levels are likely to be below our prior estimates,"" he wrote. He cut his price targets on Skyworks and Qorvo stocks to 70 and 50 from 77 and 54, respectively, but kept his buy ratings.But Gil retained his buy rating and 50 price target on Cirrus Logic stock.Cirrus Logic reported $232 million in sales for the quarter that ended March 26 and 38 cents earnings per share ex items, down a respective 9% and 42% vs. the year-earlier quarter. The consensus of nine analysts polled by Thomson Reuters called for $226.2 million and 21 cents.Cirrus Logic wrapped up fiscal 2016 with $1.2 billion in sales and $2.40 EPS minus items, topping Wall Street for $1.16 billion and $2.22. Sales climbed 31% but EPS fell 10%.On a year-over-year basis, portable audio product sales -- which would include mobile -- fell 11% in fiscal Q4 but rose 34% in fiscal 2016.For the current quarter, Cirrus Logic expects $220 million to $250 million in sales, which at the midpoint would be down 17% and missing expectations for $258 million.But Cirrus Logic is gaining content at Apple, ""thus insulating it from potential unit shipment declines,"" Gill wrote. Outside Apple, he estimates that Cirrus Logic's total addressable digital solutions market could reach $420 million over the next four years, up from just $21 million.Besides Skyworks and Qorvo, fellow Apple supplier Texas Instruments (TXN) is also slated to post financials late Wednesday. Shares for the three companies were down a respective 1.5%, 2% and fraction midday Wednesday.For fiscal Q2, the consensus of 25 analysts expects Skyworks to report $775.6 million in sales and $1.24 EPS minus items, up a respective 2% and 8% year over year.Wall Street calls for Qorvo to report $600 million in sales and 92 cents EPS minus items for its fiscal Q4, and $2.6 billion and $4.26 for its fiscal 2016. Across the board, every metric would fall vs. the year-earlier period.Texas Instruments is expected to wrap Q1 with $2.98 billion in sales and 62 cents EPS, down 5% and up 2%, respectively.

230,QRVO,"Apple's (AAPL) iPhone 7 expectations might have dug into guidance provided Wednesday by Analog Devices (ADI), as the 3D Touch supplier topped Q2 expectations but guided to current-quarter sales that would dip 5% year over year.In early trading on the stock market today, Analog Devices shares were up a fraction, near 55.50. Fellow Apple suppliers Broadcom (AVGO), NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Qorvo (QRVO) were up all by close to 2% or more.For its fiscal Q2 ended April 30, Analog Devices reported $779 million in sales and 64 cents earnings per share ex items, down a respective 5% and 12% vs. the year-earlier quarter. It was the first quarter in nine that Analog Devices' sales have fallen and the second period of declining EPS.But both metrics beat the consensus of 29 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters for $777.6 million and 62 cents, as well as Analog Devices' own guidance issued three months ago.Consumer sales toppled 27% year over year, leading a 3% fall in communications sales, Analog Devices said. Industrial and automotive sales -- Analog Devices' bread-and-butter segments -- fell 1% apiece.For fiscal Q3, Analog Devices CEO Vincent Roche sees a return to consumer market growth and mid- to high-single-digit growth in the company's business-to-business segments. But the high point of ADI's Q3 sales and EPS guidance lagged Wall Street consensus.Analog Devices guided to $800 million to $840 million in sales and 66-74 cents, down a respective 5% and 9% vs. the year-earlier quarter, missing analysts' model for $846.6 million and 75 cents.On average, Analog Devices' Q3 sales have grown 13.5% year over year, trailing 20% growth in Q4. But recent reports indicate Apple might have cut its component orders for the iPhone 7, expected to be released in September.

231,QRVO,"Apple's (AAPL) iPhone 7 news is seen as positive for Broadcom (AVGO), Cirrus Logic (CRUS) and Intel (INTC), but negative for Qualcomm (QCOM), according to Wall Street analysts.The iPhone 7 supports 25 radio-frequency bands vs. 23 bands in the iPhone 6S series.""Overall the increased RF content should remain a tailwind for RF suppliers as other handset (manufacturers) emulate the iPhone road map,"" Mizuho Securities analyst Vijay Rakesh said in a research report. The increased bands in the iPhone 7 will be especially positive for Broadcom, he said.The increased bands should benefit all RF suppliers, but Broadcom and Qorvo (QRVO) will benefit more than Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), Cowen analyst Timothy Arcuri said.IBD'S TAKE: Among Apple chip suppliers seen benefiting from the iPhone 7 launch, only Broadcom is on the IBD 50 list of top-performing stocks.Audio chipmaker Cirrus Logic will profit from Apple's decision to remove the analog audio jack from the iPhone 7 and include digital earbuds and an adapter with the new handset, Pacific Crest Securities analyst John Vinh said in a report.Cirrus Logic also will benefit from Apple adding a second speaker to the iPhone 7 to give it stereo sound, he said.""We anticipate an incremental $2.50 in content associated with the Lightning earpods, Lightning adapter and second stereo speaker,"" Vinh said. ""Despite the significant content increase, we believe much of this has already been built into guidance and stock expectations.""For that reason, he is sector weight, or neutral, on Cirrus Logic stock.It is unclear whether Cirrus Logic has content in Apple's new wireless earbuds called AirPods, Vinh noted. AirPods will go on sale in late October for $159 a pair.His ""favorite Apple-exposed suppliers"" are Analog Devices (ADI), Broadcom, InvenSense (INVN) and Skyworks.Suppliers getting content boosts from the iPhone 7 likely include ADI and Broadcom, RBC Capital Markets said in a report.ADI could get about 30% more content in the iPhone 7 vs. the iPhone 6S series after winning a processor for the camera module, RBC said. Analog Devices gets about 13% of its revenue from Apple.Broadcom also could see a 30% boost in content in the iPhone 7, RBC said. Broadcom gets about 15% to 18% of its revenue from Apple.The iPhone 7 is a negative for Qualcomm, because it could lose 20% to 25% of its baseband chip share in the new smartphone to Intel, BMO Capital Markets analyst Tim Long said in a report.Qualcomm is supplying CDMA versions of the iPhone 7 and Intel is supplying non-CDMA versions, which is based on the wireless technologies carriers use.Apple's iPhone 7 is seen as positive for memory suppliers Micron Technology (MU) and Western Digital (WDC) because the new handsets feature twice as much Nand flash data storage as last year's models.The iPhone 7 series has data storage from 32 gigabytes to 256 GB vs. the prior 16 GB to 128 GB.""Doubling Nand storage could further tighten Nand supply and set a trend toward 256-GB handset densities,"" Mizuho's Rakesh said. ""The increased Nand storage should drive further pricing and margin stability in an already tight Nand supply chain, which is a clear positive for MU and WDC.""Apple shares finished 2.6% lower on stock market today at 105.52, as its announcement carried few surprises. Broadcom dipped 0.3%, Qualcomm rose 0.4%, Intel was essentially flat, Cirrus Logic eased 0.15%, while Micron gained 1.7%.RELATED:Apple iPhone 7 Launch Not 'Insanely Great,' But 'Good Enough'

232,QRVO,"Apple (AAPL) iPhone supplier Qorvo (QRVO) topped Wall Street's fiscal Q1 expectations and beat fiscal Q2 guidance expectations by more than $100 million late Tuesday, but shares toppled late as gross profit margins missed expectations.In after-hours trading Tuesday, Qorvo stock was down more than 4% after falling 3.2%, to 61.45, in Tuesday's regular session. Shares are up 21% for the year, though, and are now 18% extended from a 52.05 entry point out of a cup-with-handle formation achieved June 1.For fiscal Q1 ended July 2, Qorvo reported $698.5 million in sales and $1.08 earnings per share ex items, up 4% and flat, respectively, vs. the year-earlier quarter. The consensus of 22 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters modeled $650.6 million and $1.05.But 48.2% gross margin ex items missed analysts' 50.1% view. Operating expenses nearly doubled sequentially, hitting $270.7 million, which, MKM analyst Ian Ing says, likely reflects new product ramps for several flagship smartphones that use Qorvo chips.Apple's iPhone 7 is slated to launch Sept. 16. Qorvo is a longtime supplier for Apple.""It was a good top-line and bottom-line beat, but the gross margin trends were unfavorable, as well as op-ex,"" Ing told IBD. He expected 50% gross margin ex items for Qorvo's fiscal Q1.Current-quarter guidance for $820 million to $850 million in sales and $1.35 to $1.45 EPS minus items easily topped the consensus. On a year-over-year basis, sales and EPS would be up a respective 18% and 15%.Tuesday's fiscal Q1 results reverse a two-quarter trend of declining EPS. Sales also declined vs. last year in fiscal Q4.IBD'S TAKE: Qorvo stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 91, meaning it performs in the top 9% of all stocks in terms of key metrics. The industry group is ranked No. 45 out of 197 groups tracked, and has climbed from No. 177 over the past 13 weeks. 
"
233,QRVO,"Qorvo (QRVO) reacted faster than most to slow sales of the Apple (AAPL) iPhone 6S and took market share from rival Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) in the upcoming iPhone 7, analysts said, but gross profit margins last quarter and this quarter speak of challenges ahead, and Qorvo stock fell sharply Wednesday despite its earnings beat last Tuesday.Qorvo stock tumbled 10.3% to 55.12 in the stock market today, tumbling below its 50-day average. The stock briefly fell back in a buy zone from a cup-with-handle breakout on June 1 at a 52.05 buy point. Since then, however, shares rose as high as 64.80 on July 27, a 52-week high, up 24.5% from the buy point and well past the 20% gains at which investors are advised to lock in at least some profits.Late Tuesday, Qorvo reported better-than-expected revenue and earnings per share minus items for its fiscal Q1 ended July 2, and its guidance for the current quarter also beat Wall Street views, according to analysts polled by Thomson Reuters.IBD'S TAKE: Qorvo ranks No. 4 in its big industry group, with a Composite Rating of 91 that puts it among the top 9% of all stocks in key metrics like sales growth. Earnings growth, however, is its one red flag, as you can learn at IBD Stock Checkup.But the company's Q1 gross margin minus items of 48.2% missed views for 50.1%, and its margin guidance for the current quarter also fell short.Qorvo sales did better than expected in China, analysts said, but the weak profit margin was ""due to poor yields on quadplexers being shipped into Chinese smartphones,"" Pacific Crest Securities analyst John Vinh said in a research note late Tuesday. ""Qorvo cited lower SAW filter yields as the primary culprit,"" but is taking remedies to fix the problem.Quadplexers and SAW (surface acoustic wave) filters are used to eliminate radio frequency interference in mobile communications. Qorvo is a leading provider of RF chips for smartphones and other devices.Vinh also wrote that ""Qorvo reaffirmed expectations for content growth in the iPhone 7,"" and that it had ""faced the iPhone 6S inventory correction earlier than its peers,"" but he maintained a sector weight rating on Qorvo stock.Qorvo's solid guidance ""confirms our belief that Qorvo has taken market share from Skyworks in the iPhone 7,"" wrote Rosenblatt Securities analyst Jun Zhang in a research note Wednesday.""We believe it is a positive sign that Qorvo has taken market share in the iPhone 7, but on the other hand, Qorvo might face more volatility over the next two quarters due to our cautiousness on overall iPhone sales,"" Zhang said. ""We are mid-term positive on Qorvo as we expect their BAW (bulk acoustic wave) and SAW filter products to ramp, but in the near run, the increasing smartphone supply chain headwinds from China's inventory correction bring equal risk to all smartphone components.""Apple stock rose 1.25% to 105.79.
"
234,QRVO,"Apple (AAPL) iPhone 6S demand improved in July, but a shift to the lower-end iPhone SE could pressure Apple's component suppliers such as Cirrus Logic (CRUS), Qorvo (QRVO) and Synaptics (SYNA), Pacific Crest analysts said Friday.Meanwhile, Analog Devices (ADI), Broadcom (AVGO) and InvenSense (INVN) will withstand a looming 15%-20% cut on iPhone 7 component orders, but not because of any changes in Apple trends.In July, carriers had six days of iPhone 6S inventory on hand, dropping from a year-high of nine days in April, the investment bank said in a research note. Meanwhile, iPhone SE demand normalized, rising from north of one day in May and June to six days in July.Pacific Crest targets six to 10 days of on-hand inventory for carriers. Inventory rocketed early in the year, as Apple experienced its first dip in iPhone sales.""Carrier store inventory declined month over month to the low end of our target,"" Pacific Crest analysts wrote in a research report. ""We view this as encouraging ahead of the iPhone 7 launch in September.""But that launch, expected next month, comes with a muted forecast. Pacific Crest sees component orders declining 15%-20% for the iPhone 7 vs. its predecessor iPhone 6S in 2015.Many chipmakers, including Apple suppliers Analog Devices, InvenSense, Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Texas Instruments (TXN), during their most recent earnings calls, predicted slower year-over-year demand for their consumer/mobile units.""We're not expecting ... any outlandish unit growth in the mobile market,"" Cirrus Logic CEO Jason Rhode said on the company's fiscal Q1 earnings conference call on July 27. ""We've got something of a content story this year.""IBD'S TAKE: Broadcom ranks No. 1 in IBD's 41-company Electronic-Semiconductor Fabless industry group. The group has climbed to No. 10 out of 197 groups tracked, up from No. 65 only 13 weeks ago. Get IBD's Stock Checkup to examine individual chipmakers.Pacific Crest maintained sector weight ratings on Cirrus Logic, Qorvo, Skyworks Solutions and Synaptics. The likely transition to digital headsets is already baked into Cirrus Logic stock, and the more conservative iPhone 7 cycle will offset content gains for Qorvo, analysts wrote.Synaptics, on the other hand, is poised for share loss at Apple, Pacific Crest predicted. Synaptics supplies a touch-chip for Apple iPhones, but that could be at risk as Apple reportedly makes the move to OLED (organic light-emitting diode) screens in 2017.OLED technology allow for thinner and more flexible screens, but they are also double the cost of LCD (liquid crystal diode) screens, which Apple uses now. The switch will likely add $30 to $35 to the total bill of materials for the iPhone 8, analysts say.""We believe there could be risk that Apple looks to squeeze its other component suppliers on price in order to recoup the incremental BOM associated with the OLED display,"" the Pacific Crest analysts wrote.In the meantime, Apple suppliers such as Analog Devices, Broadcom and InvenSense stand to outperform, Pacific Crest said. It has overweight ratings on all three stocks.Broadcom is positioned to benefit from the carrier aggregation trend as more infrastructure is built to support 4G and LTE, says Pacific Crest. Analog Devices recently announced its $14.8 billion plan to acquire Linear Technology (LLTC), a move that cuts its Apple exposure. InvenSense is gaining on augmented reality trends such as with the mobile game ""Pokemon Go,"" they said.On the stock market today, Analog Devices rose 0.4% and Synaptics 0.2%. Shares of Cirrus Logic fell 0.2% while Broadcom climbed 0.6% and Skyworks 0.7%. InvenSense stock was down 1.6%, and Qorvo stock was weaker by 0.55%.RELATED:Broadcom Likely Gained 20% Apple iPhone 7 Content Despite 'Muted' RampApple's Smartphone Profit Share Slipping Vs.

235,QRVO,"Stocks worked to fortify their slim early gains, as earnings action powered the bulk of Tuesday morning's trade.The S&P 500 climbed 0.3%, aided by rising oil prices. The Dow and the Nasdaq tacked on 0.2% each. Volume rose 4% on the NYSE and 20% on the Nasdaq compared with the same time Monday.Earnings reports were the primary driver in early action for the stock  market today. Before the open, the Commerce Department reported a rise in March durable goods order -- an improvement over February's decline, but well short of the increase expected by economists.The S&P/Case-Shiller 20 City Composite Home Price Index edged up 0.7% for February, in line with expectations. The index gained 0.8% in January.Oil futures steepened their early gains. West Texas Intermediate gained almost 2%. Gold ebbed a fraction to below $1,237 an ounce.Gains edged out declines among Dow stocks.

Management said the demand environment ""continues to be subdued,"" but that headwinds experienced during 2015 should begin to subside in the coming quarters. NXP is tacking toward its ninth gain in 10 weeks, up 44% from a February low and back above its converged 10- and 40-week moving averages.On the IBD 50, Broadcom (AVGO) snapped out to an early lead.

236,QRVO,"Apple (AAPL) stock tumbled to its lowest level in nearly two years on Thursday, following a report that Asian component suppliers are seeing weak orders related to the upcoming iPhone 7.Japanese business publication Nikkei Asian Review reported Thursday that Taiwan-based tech suppliers expect to get significantly fewer orders from Apple in the second half of this year compared with the year-earlier period. They cited the ""ongoing slump in demand for premium smartphones and a lack of groundbreaking features for the upcoming iPhone 7.""Nikkei Asian Review this week also reported that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) expects its iPhone chip shipments for the June-to-December period will be about 70% to 80% of the level reached in the second half of 2015.Credit Suisse analyst Kulbinder Garcha said the market overreacted to the Nikkei report.The prediction that iPhone builds would be down 20% to 30% in the second half of the year vs. the same period in 2015 was expected and already should have been baked into the stock’s price.“While the news is clearly disappointing, it was already largely included in our iPhone unit estimates,” he said in a report Thursday.Elsewhere, Taiwan-based contract manufacturer Foxconn Technology Group said its first-quarter net profit fell 9.2% from a year earlier, as it was hit by a slowdown in iPhone sales, the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday. Foxconn is Apple’s main iPhone assembler.Apple stock fell 2.4%, to 90.32, on the stock market today, and fell as low as 89.47. TSM stock fell 1%, to 22.99.IBD's Take: How healthy is Apple's stock and how does it stand up vs. rivals? Find out at IBD Stock Checkup.Other Apple chip suppliers also fell Thursday, including InvenSense (INVN), NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), Cirrus Logic (CRUS), Broadcom (AVGO), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), Qorvo (QRVO) and Texas Instruments (TXN).Apple stock has risen in only four of the last 20 trading sessions. Since hitting its 2016 high of 112.39 on April 14, Apple stock has fallen about 20%.Most of the decline happened after the Cupertino, Calif.-based company reported March-quarter results and gave June-quarter guidance on April 26. For its fiscal Q2, Apple posted its first year-over-year sales decline since 2003 and its first-ever drop in iPhone unit sales. For the current Q3, Apple is targeting sales of $42 billion, down 15% from the same period last year.Demand for Apple's latest handsets, the iPhone 6S series, has been relatively weak, and hopes for a return to unit sales growth have shifted to the iPhone 7, expected to be released in September.The iPhone 7 is predicted to feature a slimmer design, a speedier processor and a better camera. It also might be waterproof for the first time, according to tech news reports. But it is expected to look pretty much like the current models, with tweaks like the lack of an audio headset jack.RELATED:Apple Stock Gets Price-Target Cut On Longer iPhone Upgrade Cycle.

237,QRVO,"Petering Apple (AAPL) and Samsung demand prodded a Raymond James analyst to downgrade suppliers NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), Qorvo (QRVO), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and others, even with the iPhone 7 launch expected in September.Apple suppliers broadly fell in morning trading on the stock market today. Radio-frequency chip companies Qorvo and Skyworks were down 2.6% and 2.2%, respectively, on the downgrade, tugging rival Broadcom (AVGO) down 1.3%.Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM) stock was down more than 1%, while Apple suppliers Analog Devices (ADI), NXP and Texas Instruments (TXN) stocks were all down roughly 1%.In all, Raymond James analyst Steven Smigie downgraded six semiconductor stocks to outperform from strong buy, citing likely in-line earnings and minimal upside to June guidance.Following a January drop in the stocks, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index has rebounded 20% since mid-February, Smigie wrote in a research report. Some stocks have run up 40%, he noted.But ""with only modest signs that there is the potential for near-term upside to (earnings per share), and some signs of modest downside, we worry that shares have a limited upside, with reasonable downside risk,"" he wrote.Confidence could improve in the seasonally stronger second half of 2016, when Apple typically launches its newest iPhone flagship. But ""Apple is seeing modestly lower demand,"" said Smigie, who questioned the likelihood of a positive June guide by Apple. He also noted some pain points for radio-frequency suppliers that have more than 45% exposure to Apple.""Even if the Apple guide is healthy, we think skepticism will remain until the summer when we start to get evidence of the iPhone 7 ramp and questions about iPhone SE cannibalizing other iPhone models get resolved,"" he wrote.Samsung sales zoomed on its Galaxy S7 flagship, but pre-orders were likely influenced by free Gear VR (virtual reality) giveaways, Smigie wrote. Huawei, on the other hand, is a ""bright spot"" and recently guided to 120 million to 140 million units in 2016. The lion's share of those units will be high-end smartphones, Huawei said.Outside mobile, PC and industrial results have been weak, offsetting some strength in the growing automotive and infotainment arenas -- the latter being NXP's bailiwick following its acquisition of Freescale Semiconductor.But even in the automotive segment, ""we have heard concerns from a number of investors on subprime lending,"" Smigie wrote. Until those fears level out, automotive-exposed semiconductors could face some headwinds.Respective estimates from industry trackers Gartner and IDC show the PC segment saw 9.6% and 11.5% year-over-year declines in Q1 shipments. And March industrial production fell 0.6% vs. expectations for a 0.1% decline, says Smigie.Smigie notes positively, ""we still like many of the stories, however, so all else being equal, on a pullback we could look to get more aggressive again.""

238,QRVO,"Apple's (AAPL) iPhone shortfall could draw InvenSense (INVN) into the tornado late Monday when the sensor-chipmaker is expected to report its first-ever sales decline and its biggest earnings fall to date.InvenSense stock toppled 5.5% to 7, falling the most of IBD's 41-company Electronic Semiconductor-Fabless industry group which was up a fraction on the stock market today.Fellow Apple suppliers Broadcom (AVGO) and Qualcomm (QCOM) stocks rose 1.2% and 0.1%, respectively, vs. flat shares of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) and Cirrus Logic (CRUS). InvenSense follows radio-frequency supplier Qorvo (QRVO), which reported earnings last Wednesday.The consensus of 13 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters models $79.9 million in sales and 2 cents earnings per share ex items for InvenSense's fiscal Q4. On a year-over-year basis, sales and EPS would be down 20% and 83%, respectively.It would be InvenSense's fifth straight quarter of decelerating sales growth, and the first time the Apple supplier has seen sales fall vs. the year-earlier quarter. Earnings fell 14% last quarter.Three months ago, InvenSense guided to $77 million to $83 million in sales and 0-2 cents EPS ex items.During the January conference call, CFO Mark Dentinger noted a step-down at ""the North American customer"" -- widely assumed to be Apple -- and lighter sales in Korea. He expected Internet of Things sales to help fill those holes.On April 26, Apple reported its first-ever year-over-year iPhone sales decline and its first revenue drop since 2003. Teardowns show InvenSense supplies a gyroscope/accelerometer combination chip for the iPhone 6S.But InvenSense is forecast for 13% sales and 2% EPS growth in fiscal 2016 to $420.9 million and 47 cents, respectively, on healthier metrics earlier in the year.Apple shares rose 1% intraday after hitting a 2-year low on Friday.

Economists had projected a milder rise to 262,000 claims.Oil prices bounded more than 4% higher, sending Brent crude above $46 per barrel and lifting West Texas Intermediate to past $45. Wildfires in Canada’s northern Alberta province were apparently a factor.

The stock has been on a run since Jan. 15, climbing 25% after a two-week fall.NXP and Cirrus Logic stocks split the difference in Thursday trading, up 0.2% and down 2.1%, respectively. Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Qorvo (QRVO) were up 1.6% and 0.3%, respectively, after Apple reported its first ever year-over-year iPhone shipment decline late Tuesday.For the first quarter, Texas Instruments reported $3.01 billion in sales and 65 cents earnings per share, down 5% and up 7%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier quarter. Both measures topped the consensus of 36 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters for $2.98 billion and 62 cents.Analog sales -- which includes power management chips used in the iPhone 6S -- declined 8% year over year to $1.88 billion. The drop was expected MKM analyst Ian Ing wrote in a research report. Apple comprised 15% of Texas Instruments' 2015 sales.""While the year-over-year shortfall in smartphones was $150 million, the inclusion of (a) weak PC (segment) results in an even greater shortfall,” he wrote in a research report. ""The year-over-year revenue gap is expected to decline somewhat in June, but still be significant.""Embedded-processing revenue grew 8% vs. the year-earlier quarter to $729 million in sales. Sales of custom integrated circuits drove a 10% year-over-year decline in Texas Instruments' other sales.Texas Instruments' current-quarter guidance for $3.07 billion to $3.33 billion in sales and 67 cents to 77 cents EPS would be flat and down 1%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis. But that outlook topped analyst views for $3.18 billion and 71 cents at the midpoints.Credit Suisse analyst John Pitzer noted that Texas Instruments is ""consistently executing on consistent execution."" He boosted his price target on Texas Instruments stock to 65 from 60, but reiterated his neutral rating.During Q1, Texas Instruments hit a record 60.6% gross margin. Pitzer and RBC analyst Amit Daryanani expect that to continue, driven by better manufacturing gains, improved mix and impressive execution.Daryanani upped his price target on Texas Instruments stock to 68 from 65, but kept his outperform rating.

244,QRVO,"Late Tuesday, Apple (AAPL) iPhone chip supplier Qorvo (QRVO) is expected to report fiscal Q1 sales and earnings that toppled into the red vs. last year, but shares dawdled Monday for a fourth straight day, extended at least 20% from a buy point, a zone at which investors might want to lock in at least some profits.Qorvo stock is 21% extended from a 52.05 buy point out of a cup-with-handle formation achieved June 1. Shares rose 24% in 2016 year to date through Friday, and they closed up 0.4% at 63.47 on the stock market today.The company created from the January 2015 merger of TriQuint Semiconductor and RF Micro Devices is slated to report fiscal Q1 earnings after the close Tuesday. Analysts expect Qorvo to report $650.6 million in sales and $1.05 earnings per share ex items, each metric down 4% from the year-earlier period.Qorvo has guided to $650 million in sales and $1.05 EPS ex items.Sales declined for the first time in eight quarters in fiscal Q4, ended in March.

246,QRVO,"Apple’s (AAPL) new iPhone SE probably has a gross profit margin of about 35% for the entry-level model, which is well below the mid-40% margins enjoyed by the rest of the iPhone family, RBC Capital Markets said in a research report Thursday.But the new phone, which starts at $399, will still give a lift to revenue and profit, RBC analyst Amit Daryanani said in the report.The iPhone SE could provide $6.8 billion in revenue and 23 cents in earnings per share this calendar year, assuming Apple sells an incremental 15 million units, Daryanani said.He reiterated his outperform rating on Apple stock, with a price target of 130. Apple was down a fraction, below 109, in morning trading on the stock market today.Based on teardown reports, the 16-gigabyte model iPhone SE has a bill of materials cost of about $260, Daryanani said. The 4-inch iPhone uses many of the same components found in the larger-screen, higher-priced iPhone 6 and 6S series phones.The iPhone SE likely benefited from cheaper components that were the result of Apple suppliers left with excess inventory after the iPhone 6S underperformed, he said.Chipmakers Qualcomm (QCOM) and Qorvo (QRVO) topped content in the iPhone SE, but Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Texas Instruments (TXN) gained new chips in the refreshed 4-inch smartphone, a Chipworks teardown found.The iPhone SE went on sale Thursday. It was a low-key product launch for Apple, with few stores seeing lines forming outside, Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster said in a report Thursday.Also, a check of 100 Apple stores in the U.S. found 90% availability for the iPhone SE, he said.“We view both the lack of lines and the high level of product availability as in line with expectations, reinforcing our view that the SE will be largely incremental to the model in replacing the low-end iPhone 5S,” Munster said.RELATED:Middle-Aged Apple Might Get A Sports Car, New Girlfriend.

247,QRVO,"Chipmakers Qualcomm (QCOM) and Qorvo (QRVO) topped content in Apple’s (AAPL) newly launched iPhone SE, but Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Texas Instruments (TXN) gained new chips in the 4-inch smartphone, a Chipworks teardown found Thursday.Apple's iPhone SE is ""the most powerful 4-inch phone ever,"" the smartphone giant says. It was unveiled March 21 and began shipping today, the same day Tesla Motors (TSLA) began taking orders for its less expensive Model 3.Researchers with Chipworks and iFixit classified the iPhone SE, the first to not have a number in its name, as the iPhone 6S squeezed into the iPhone 5S body.""There are very few new parts, but that hardly means there is no innovation,"" Chipworks wrote. But Apple engaged in ""serious economical re-use"" of many radio-frequency (RF) chips, excepting the Skyworks and Texas Instruments additions.New to the iPhone SE, Skyworks gained a power amplifier module and Texas Instruments earned a power management chip. Privately-held Toshiba and Epcos made new appearances with a flash-memory chip and an antenna switch module.A new power management chip could also be an Apple-Dialog Semiconductor mash-up, Chipworks wrote.Qualcomm and Qorvo each have four chips in the phone, leading Skyworks, which contributed three iPhone SE chips. Broadcom (AVGO) and Cirrus Logic (CRUS) each supplied two chips. Texas Instruments, NXP Semiconductor (NXPI) and InvenSense (INVN) all brought one apiece to the table.The A9 processor was supplied by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM), in this particular phone. But Apple dual-sourced the A9 in the iPhone 6S, splitting share between Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung.Samsung reportedly has since said that it would yield the A10 processor to Taiwan Semiconductor. The A10 processor is scheduled to make its debut in the iPhone 7, likely to be launched in September.

248,QRVO,"Apple (AAPL) supplier Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) ought to acquire Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM) to diversify from the slowing smartphone and radio-frequency market, Pacific Crest analyst Michael McConnell suggested Thursday.Maxim has long been takeover bait with sharks Analog Devices (ADI) and Texas Instruments (TXN) reportedly eyeing the $10.5 billion-market-cap chipmaker in October. But sources told Bloomberg that Maxim might not sell without a high premium.Skyworks could provide that premium, McConnell wrote in a research report. Maxim stock rose a fraction Thursday, to 36.78. Skyworks was flat. An offer of $44 per share would be a 20% premium to Maxim stock, McConnell points out.Acquiring Maxim would help Skyworks diversify beyond its 80% exposure to the struggling mobile market, McConnell wrote. Maxim has ties to the data center and automotive markets.Though Maxim makes the most sense -- McConnell rates both a buy -- Skyworks could also diversify by acquiring Macom Technology Solutions (MTSI) or Silicon Laboratories (SLAB), McConnell wrote.RF, Skyworks' bread and butter, is slated for a compound annual growth rate of 11% over the next several years vs. historical 18% growth, McConnell wrote. Skyworks competes in the RF ring with Broadcom (AVGO) and Qorvo (QRVO), both Apple suppliers.The number of bands -- a spectrum of RF -- rocketed between 2005 and 2015, Brent Dietz, Qorvo director of corporate communications, told IBD. In 2005, there were two bands. By 2015, there were 43.McConnell sees little opportunity for continued band acceleration. And Dietz offered a similar growth view for the RF market -- a $10 billion market opportunity with a 10%-15% growth rate.But Dietz notes that the RF content in smartphones has gapped up this century. Less complex 2G phones had about 80 cents worth of RF content. Today, most smartphones have about $16 worth of RF.To that point, Broadcom's mobile RF content grows in excess of 20% every year, CEO Hock Tan said during the company's Q1 earnings conference call. He expects 2016 to be no different.This year, Qorvo and Skyworks offered similar views of growing dollar content in marquee smartphones. Recent teardowns show that Samsung completely replaced three Skyworks chips in its Galaxy S7 and that Qorvo twice replaced Broadcom.

251,QRVO,"Apple (AAPL) is looking to bolster its iPhone profits by pressuring component suppliers for price discounts, says RBC Capital Markets.""We think Apple has been pushing for price discounts from multiple suppliers as a way to dampen foreign-exchange headwinds Apple is facing on their own P&L heading into the iPhone 7 ramps,"" RBC analyst Amit Daryanani said in a research report Tuesday.As a result, Apple could see upside to its gross profit margin, which it guided as flat for the September quarter, he said.Some Apple suppliers could see downside to their earnings, especially where multiple vendors supply the same component, he said.Single-source suppliers to Apple should be more resilient, Daryanani said. They include Broadcom (AVGO) and Analog Devices (ADI), he said.IBD'S TAKE: Broadcom stock has a best-possible IBD Composite Rating of 99. It is the top-ranked stock in IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Fabless industry group. Broadcom is also on the IBD 50 list of top-performing stocks.A consistent trend from the June-quarter earnings season was Apple component suppliers guiding gross margins lower, Daryanani said.""Ten out of 11 suppliers that we tracked saw gross margins head lower for second-half 2016 vs. prior expectations (the only exception was TTM Technologies (TTMI)),"" he said.Daryanani rates Apple stock as outperform with a price target of 115. Apple stock rose 0.4% to 108.81 on the stock market today. Apple has risen for eight of the last 10 trading sessions, since reporting better-than-expected June quarter results and guiding Wall Street higher for the September quarter.Some chip companies get a majority of their revenue from Apple. And quite a few firms get 10% or more of their sales from supplying Apple. In his report, Daryanani spelled out which companies get the most business from Apple.Companies with the greatest exposure to Apple business include Dialog Semiconductor (75% of revenue), Cirrus Logic (CRUS) (66%), Foxconn (over 50%), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) (44%), Qorvo (QRVO) (32%), Advanced Semiconductor Engineering (ASX) (31%) and InvenSense (INVN) (30%).Companies with less exposure to Apple, but which still get a significant share of sales from the Cupertino, Calif.-based company, include: Knowles (KN) (25%), Jabil Circuit (JBL) (24%), TTM (20%), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) (16%), Pegatron (15%-25%), Broadcom (15%-20%), Analog Devices (13%), Qualcomm (QCOM) (13%), Texas Instruments (TXN) (11%) and Amphenol (APH) (10%).Companies with small exposure to Apple business include Intel (INTC) (3%-5%), Flextronics (FLEX) (3%-4%) and Nvidia (NVDA) (3%-4%), Daryanani said.

252,QRVO,"It seems Broadcom (AVGO) just can't resist making merger deals -- whether joining forces with another company or shedding some of its own operations.The supplier to Apple (AAPL) iPhones seemed set after making its mammoth $37 billion deal to merge with Avago earlier this year. In March, a mere month after the transaction closed, Broadcom Chief Executive Hock Tan spurned any talk of future transactions. Tan told analysts a merger or acquisition was the ""furthest thing"" from his mind.That was then. Tan's tune changed a couple months later when he told analysts on the June 2 second-quarter conference call that Broadcom will pull excess cash for mergers, as gross debt is close to double its adjusted earnings. Broadcom, the No. 2 fabless chipmaker, is still trying to buffer itself from volatile smartphone sales and angle for the more stable wired segment.Analysts say the merger strategy is working. Morgan Stanley's Craig Hettenbach notes the company now has greater diversification, with a hand in wireless, wired, enterprise storage and industrial segments.""The ebb and flow between Broadcom's end markets has allowed the company to meet revenue expectations in recent quarters despite the overriding demand weakness that has had a negative impact on most peers,"" Hettenbach wrote in a June 3 research report.Broadcom is far from new to the merger block. In fact, the company has changed hands several times itself since it was founded in 1961 as a semiconductor division under Hewlett-Packard. It left when Agilent Technologies (A) split from the company in 1999.Six years later, KKR and Silver Lake paid $2.6 billion to acquire the division of Agilent that later became Avago. Before going public in 2009, Avago sold one of its divisions to PMC-Sierra. PMC, in turn, was acquired early this year by Microsemi (MSCC).Eight years of rampant merger deals followed. In 2013, Avago acquired optical chip supplier CyOptics for $400 million and storage/networking firm LSI for $6.6 billion. Meanwhile, Avago peeled off several layers of its own by selling divisions to Intel (INTC) and Seagate Technology (STX). Then it turned the tables and bought Emulex in 2015 for $606 million.Earlier this year, Broadcom divested its Internet of Things and wireless infrastructure units to Cypress Semiconductor (CY) and MaxLinear (MXL) in deals worth a combined $630 million. Broadcom is likely to use those proceeds to pay down debt before seeking another deal.But the Big Kahuna was Avago's merger with the former Broadcom. That acquisition wrapped in February and was one of a number of chip-sector deals worth a cumulative $115 billion. (Intel bought Altera for $17 billion, and NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) took on Freescale Semiconductors for $12 billion.)Combined, the new company kept Broadcom's name but used Avago's ticker, AVGO. The move helped it to diversify, and analysts thus changed their tune on the stock. In 2017, RBC analyst Amit Daryanani expects Broadcom to make a play for larger assets like Maxim Integrated (MXIM), NXP or Xilinx (XLNX).At least 16 analysts rated Broadcom stock a buy in the week following its Q2 earnings release, the first quarter in which the two companies were consolidated. Meanwhile, shareholders busted Broadcom stock out of a cup formation on June 3. Shares rocketed 7.7% before dipping almost immediately into a second cup. Broadcom stock topped a 166 entry point on July 27, but it has since pulled back.Broadcom shares ended Friday trading at a new all-time high of 170.12, up 1.9%, but lost some ground Monday. Shares finished Monday's trades down 1% to 168.35.Wireless sales accounted for a mere 22% of total revenue -- dipping below 30% for the first time in seven quarters. Broadcom's smartphone-facing unit accounted for 37% of sales in 2015. In 2014 and 2013, wireless revenue was 42% and 49% of total sales.Despite slowing importance to Broadcom's overall scheme, Tan hinted that radio-frequency content for smartphones has increased and would likely continue to rise by 20% annually for the next two to three years. That means even as smartphone units slow, Broadcom could see its take per phone grow.IBD'S TAKE: Broadcom tops IBD's 41-company Electronic Semiconductor-Fabless industry group. The group has climbed to No. 20 out of 197 groups tracked from No. 74 two months ago. Get Broadcom's IBD Stock Checkup here.UBS analyst Stephen Chin estimates that Broadcom could see its dollar content per unit boost to $8-$10 in the long term. Growth will come from additional content at existing tier-one smartphone makers like Apple and Samsung and as more infrastructure comes online to support 4G and LTE devices worldwide.""This could drive the need for additional FBAR (film bulk acoustic resonator) filters,"" Chin wrote in a July 15 research report. FBAR filters are a common component used in advanced smartphones. The filters account for about 12% of Broadcom's sales, Chin estimated.Broadcom's three-year agreement with Apple for chips ""suggests it will remain the FBAR market leader,"" Chin said. In a July 8 note to clients, RBC's Daryanani estimated that Broadcom's Apple-tied sales could grow more than 15% over the next three years.Diversification is key for RF suppliers like Broadcom, Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Qorvo (QRVO), which are jockeying for position as mobile sales stagnate. Vendors shipped 343.3 million smartphones in the second quarter, flat vs. last year, industry tracker IDC wrote in a July 28 note. Sequentially, smartphone shipments were up 3.1% from the first quarter.Still, mobile giants like Apple are changing their game to focus on services, IDC analyst Ryan Reith says. As smartphone makers shift strategies, so too do chipmakers.For Broadcom that means greater emphasis on its wired segment, which made up 58% of sales in the second quarter, accelerating from 22% of sales in the first quarter. Its previous three-year quarterly average in that unit was 22% of sales. Broadcom has beat Wall Street's total sales expectations for the past seven quarters.Broadcom's wired unit is largely enterprise-facing. The segment includes Broadcom's Tomahawk chips for cloud-scale networking and its Jericho platform for routing. Jericho will drive additional upside to top-line expectations for the third quarter, UBS' Chin said.""We estimate Jericho has started ramping recently and there is virtually no alternative chip supplier in the market,"" he wrote. ""The main competition is from networking OEM internal ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) designs.""

253,QRVO,"Apple (AAPL) supplier Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) is expected late Thursday to report a sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year declines in earnings. In its fiscal third-quarter report, Skyworks also is forecast to post sales that recovered minimally from the company's slowest-ever growth period.For fiscal Q3, the consensus of 24 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters models $750.2 million in sales, down 7% on a year-over-year basis vs. 2% growth in the prior quarter. But $1.21 earnings per share ex items would fall 10%.Skyworks' sales and EPS have both decelerated for five consecutive quarters. Like Apple's other chip suppliers, Skyworks was tugged down in April on Apple's first quarterly sales drop since 2003 and first-ever iPhone sales dip.Unlike fellow Apple supplier Qualcomm (QCOM) -- set to report its fiscal Q3 on Wednesday — analysts don't expect a Q4 recovery for Skyworks. Wall Street's model calls for a 6% decline in sales and a 7% decline in EPS in fiscal Q4.Skyworks rivals Broadcom (AVGO) and Qorvo (QRVO) in supplying radio-frequency chips for Apple's iPhones. But Broadcom recently gapped up with the $37 billion merger with the former Avago, and Qorvo is leading Skyworks in the carrier-aggregation battle, Citigroup recently said.IBD's TAKE: Skyworks stock has a middling IBD Composite Rating of 54, meaning it underperforms nearly half of its rivals. But rival Broadcom boasts a top-ranking CR of 99 and its Electronics Semiconductor-Fabless industry group is No. 23 out of 197 groups tracked. Take a look at Broadcom's stock checkup.Both are more diversified than Skyworks, Citigroup says.

256,QRVO,"The iPhone SE helped Apple (AAPL) edge Wall Street's June-quarter smartphone unit sales projections, but shares of iPhone chip suppliers Broadcom (AVGO), Qualcomm (QCOM) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) lazed Wednesday.Analysts continue to have modest expectations for the iPhone 7, set to launch Sept. 16.Late Tuesday, Apple said it sold 40.4 million iPhones in its fiscal Q3, topping analyst models for 40 million but still declining 15% vs. the year-earlier period. Apple's revenue fell 23% to $24.05 billion. The company saw broad demand for the less-costly and smaller SE model.IBD'S TAKE: IBD's 41-company Electronic Semiconductor-Fabless industry group, which includes leaders like ARM Holdings, Nvidia and Monolithic Power Systems, ranks No. 21 out of 197 groups tracked. But the other chip group, the 39-company Electronic Semiconductor-Manufacturing industry group, is moving up. It ranks No. 70 and has climbed from No. 163 over the past eight weeks.FBN analyst Shebly Seyrafi models 46 million iPhones shipments in fiscal Q4, which would be roughly flat year over year. Revenue, though, would decline 16% on demand for the iPhone SE, he predicts.Canaccord analyst Matt Ramsay expects iPhone sales to be down year over year for the next couple quarters. For the September quarter, he models 44.4 million iPhones sold, but with improving average sales prices.Apple's fiscal Q4 guidance implies 44 million units, which tops the consensus for 43 million, Ramsay wrote in a research report. Fewer units sold would be bad news for Apple's slew of chip suppliers. Some, however, have said increasing content in the iPhone 7 could offset slower sales. Apple shares jumped 6.5% to 102.95 Wednesday.Qorvo (QRVO) stock rocketed as much as 7% in early trading before settling back to a 4.4% gain at the close to 63.01 on the stock market today.

257,QRVO,"Analysts downgraded Apple (AAPL) iPhone suppliers Skyworks (SWKS) and Qorvo (QRVO), while also weighing in on the outlook for Netflix (NFLX) and SolarCity's (SCTY) proposed merger with Tesla (TSLA).Mizuho downgraded Skyworks to a neutral from buy, slashing its price target on the wireless chipmaker to 68 from 99. The research firm stressed the need for Skyworks to diversify its revenue stream as its core smartphone market, which accounts for 75% of sales, slows.Mizuho also downgraded Qorvo to neutral from buy, putting a 55 target on the wireless and broadband chipmaker, in line with its closing price on Thursday.Skyworks shares fell 1.1% to 62.60 in the stock market today. Qorvo lost 1.4% to 54.50. Apple shares rose 0.3% to 95.89, but found resistance at the 50-day line.Canaccord started coverage on Netflix with a buy rating and 120 target. Earlier this week, Nielsen disclosed viewership data for streaming shows on Netflix, Hulu and other platforms.The premier episode of ""Orange is the New Black,"" which is produced by Netflix and streams on the site, was seen by 6.7 million in the U.S., comparable to HBO's hit ""Game of Thrones.""Netflix shares were up 5.7% Friday.Credit Suisse said that it thinks Tesla's proposed merger substantially undervalues SolarCity. Still, the research firm sees 60% to 70% odds that the deal closes with little or no change in the terms. It cut its rating on SolarCity to neutral from outperform, lowering the target to 27 from 38.Shares were down 0.7%.Evercore ISI downgraded Qualcomm (QCOM) to hold from buy. That followed Qualcomm's downgrade by Bernstein on Thursday, which sees Wall Street expectations for licensing revenue as too aggressive.Qualcomm was off 1.1% to 53.Meanwhile, RBC Capital Markets pared its price target on Texas Instruments (TXN) to 66 from 68 while keeping an outperform rating. Texas Instruments fell 0.9% to 62.11.Barclays downgraded temporary staffing firm Manpower's (MAN) to equal weight from overweight, slicing the price target to 65 from 85.

258,QRVO,"No. 1 chipmaker Intel (INTC) reportedly swiped a third of Apple's (AAPL) iPhone 7 modems from Qualcomm (QCOM), benefiting Qorvo (QRVO) to the potential detriment of Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), but the U.K.'s decision to exit the European Union will slug all of them, Mizuho says.On Friday, Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh downgraded Skyworks and Qorvo stocks to neutral, matching his neutral rating on Qualcomm stock. He estimates that all three are 75% tied to the smartphone market, unlike radio-frequency chip competitor Broadcom (AVGO), which is 22% exposed.Also, RBC Capital analyst Amit Daryanani cut his price targets and estimates for chipmakers Analog Devices (ADI) and Texas Instruments (TXN), noting the likelihood of stalled IT spending, and industrial and automotive demand in the wake of Brexit.On the stock market today, Qorvo stock fell 1.4% and Qualcomm 1.1%. Broadcom, Skyworks and Texas Instruments were down 0.8%, 1.1% and 0.9%, respectively, while Analog Devices dipped 1 cent to 56.63 and Intel 0.15% to 32.75. Apple rose 0.3%.""While the iPhone 7 is ramping and our checks indicate (China smartphone maker) Huawei is comfortable with its 2016 outlook, the demand uncertainty combined with a seasonally weaker Samsung/China handset market makes for a challenging second half of the year,"" Rakesh wrote.That will impact Qorvo, Qualcomm and Skyworks to a greater degree than Broadcom, he wrote. Since merging with the former Avago, Broadcom has reduced its smartphone exposure, which had accounted for half of its revenue. That lower exposure will be key amid slowing smartphone sales.Rakesh suggested Skyworks tackle M&A again after its failed attempt to buy PMC-Sierra. He cut his price target on Skyworks stock to 68 from 99, but he said the company, a key Huawei supplier, could see strength as that company ramps its newest flagship.Meanwhile, he says, Intel's likelihood of taking 30% of the iPhone 7 mix will boost Qorvo ""given its legacy relationship"" in making chips compatible with Intel chips. And Qorvo will enjoy gains on better-than-expected strength in the Samsung Galaxy S7. Rakesh kept his 55 price target on Qorvo stock.RBC's Daryanani, in his separate report, said Apple likely accounts for 10% of revenue for Texas Instruments and Analog Devices. He cut his price target on Texas Instruments to 66 from 68, and cut his PT on Analog Devices to 63 from 65, to reflect Brexit's impact. But he kept an outperform rating on both stocks.""This could offset some softness in other markets,"" he wrote. ""While it is early to access any sizable impact from Brexit, we think it is prudent to adjust expectations for Europe.""Gartner estimates that global enterprise IT spending will rise 1.2% in 2016 vs. its earlier views for 1.6% growth, Daryanani pointed out, but in the U.K., IT spending will decline 1.5% vs. prior expectations for 1.7% growth. Europe's spending is expected to dive ""modestly.""In automotive chips, RBC sees North American production as flat and European production declining 1.4% in 2017 vs. earlier projections for 2% and 2.9% growth, Daryanani wrote.Texas Instruments' automotive sales have grown at an 11% four-year compound annual growth rate, while Analog Devices has had a 14% five-year CAGR. For both, investors should now expect single-digit growth, Daryanani wrote.

259,QRVO,"Facebook (FB) was downgraded Friday ahead of its earnings next week, an Apple (AAPL) chip maker's price target was raised while another's was lowered, and Starbucks' (SBUX) price target was cut on weak Q3 same-store sales.BTIG Research downgraded Facebook  to neutral, saying that while the social networking site is one of the few ways to invest in the shift from legacy ad dollars to mobile ad revenue, investors have set expectations for Facebook ""simply too high.""Facebook is scheduled to report Q2 earnings Wednesday, and the consensus estimate is for revenue to jump 50% to $6 billion and adjusted EPS to surge 62% to 81 cents.Facebook shares initially fell but rose 0.3% to 121 in the stock market today. Facebook fell 1.1% to 120.61 on Thursday, undercutting a 121.18 buy point. Facebook cleared that entry area to a new high on Wednesday, though on light volume.Goldman Sachs lowered Starbucks' price target to 69 from 73, but said the coffee giant still has ""comp levers to pull"" and that changes in the loyalty program likely caused the drop in digital business.Late Thursday, Starbucks said the 4% growth in U.S. same-store sales in Q3 was an ""anomaly"" citing weaker consumer confidence, geopolitical uncertainty and civil unrest.In Q3, adjusted earnings grew 17% to 49 cents a share, matching views, while sales fell short of estimates with 7% growth to $5.24 billion. Analysts had expected $5.33 billion.Starbucks now sees full-year consolidated revenue growth of 10%, down from prior guidance for ""10%+"" growth.Shares fell sharply in the premarket but closed up 0.5%.Cowen raised Qorvo's (QRVO) price target to 65 from 55 but lowered Skyworks' (SWKS) price target to 72 from 76.Late Thursday, Skyworks, a supplier for Apple, reported fiscal Q3 sales and earnings that fell year-over-year but still beat analyst expectations.Fellow Apple iPhone chipmaker Qorvo rose 0.8% to 60.56. Skyworks shares plunged 8.6% to 64.81. Apple, which reports its earnings next week, fell 0.8%.Southwest Airlines' (LUV) price target was cut to 47 from 49 at Cowen. On Thursday, the budget airline missed Q2 analyst expectations and said it sees Q3 unit revenue falling 3%-4%, worse than the 1.3% drop Cowen analysts expected.The airline is working to normalize travel on Friday after a computer issue caused hundreds of canceled flights and thousands of delays earlier in the week.Southwest shares rose 1.4% to 37.83 after diving 11.2% on Thursday.Chipotle's (CMG) price target was cut to 400 from 420 at Telsey Advisory Group.

260,QRVO,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) crushed analysts' Q2 expectations and Q3 outlook early Thursday, guiding to more than $1 billion year-over-year growth amid Apple's (AAPL) iPhone 7 ramp, with the smartphone expected to be released in September.CFO Lora Ho credited Taiwan Semiconductor's Q2 performance to increases in mid- and low-end smartphone segments, and hinted at Apple's upcoming iPhone 7 release. TSM is widely rumored to be the sole producer of Apple's upcoming A10 processor.""We expect our business in the third quarter will benefit from new product launches by major mobile device customers, as well as continued inventory restocking by our customers,"" Ho said in a statement.TSM's U.S. stock rose 0.8% to 27.11 on the stock market today, in a buy zone from a 26.68 entry point out of a cup-with-handle base. Shares are up 19% this year, and the stock has a good-but-not-great IBD Relative Price Strength Rating of 80, putting it among the top 20% of all stocks in performance over the past 12 months.Shares of fellow Apple suppliers Qorvo (QRVO), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Broadcom (AVGO) lifted Thursday, up nearly 4%, more than 3% and about 2%, respectively. Qualcomm (QCOM), another Apple chip supplier, is set to report earnings next Wednesday, and Skyworks' result are due next Thursday, July 21. No. 1 chipmaker Intel (INTC) also is slated to report its Q2 earnings on Wednesday.IBD'S TAKE: Taiwan Semiconductor isn't the only chipmaker to rebound on its supposed tie to Apple's iPhone. Intel and Cirrus Logic have become the subjects of recent speculation. Intel is now 6% extended from a flat-base entry point at 37.85. Cirrus Logic is 3% extended from a cup-with-handle base and 38.24 entry point.For Q2, TSM reported $6.84 billion in sales and 43 cents earnings per American Depositary Receipt ex items, topping the consensus of analysts polled by FactSet for $6.79 billion and 41 cents. Three months ago, TSM guided revenue to about $6.65 billion to $6.75 billion.On a year-over-year basis, sales rose 3% and EPS dipped 9%. Excluding non-recurring gains in the year-earlier period, Taiwan Semiconductor's EPS would have grown by 17%, the company said.Current-quarter sales guidance for 254 billion to 257 billion Taiwan dollars (about $7.86 billion to $7.95 billion) would be up 18% from $6.67 billion in the year-earlier quarter at the midpoint. That would be TSM's biggest gain in six quarters. Analysts had modeled $7.75 billion.TSM doesn't provide EPS guidance, but analysts polled by FactSet see 55 cents, up 20% from Q3 2015.

263,QRVO,"Sector equity ETFs exemplify the value of the middle path.These vehicles allow you to actively tilt your portfolio toward this broad sector or that industry niche for successful investing. At the same time, the exchange traded fund wrapper prevents you from loading up on single-stock risk.Technology ETFs are revving up as electric carmaker Tesla (TSLA) totes up 325,000 Model 3 reservations in the first week of preorders.In fact, the three largest diversified tech ETFs are nearing buy points. The tech sector's momentum comes in large part from the chipmakers who supply parts to companies such as Tesla and Apple (AAPL).They certainly stand to benefit from the Model 3 prebookings, which reflect $14 billion of potential sales.So do the tech hardware and software companies, and communication and electronic equipment suppliers, that make everything from Tesla cars' breakthrough electric motors to the processors that power their in-dash touchscreens.A Tesla is a computer on wheels, after all.You could, of course, invest in Tesla stock, which soared to a seven-month high after the Model 3 unveiling. But perhaps you're wary after its two failed breakouts within the past year.With these three broad-based ETFs, you can tap into the technology investment theme as well as the love that consumers are lavishing on Tesla:Nvidia is a highly rated IBD 50 stock. Many of the largest stock holdings in XLK have strong balance sheets and a durable competitive edge.

264,QRVO,"A new U.S. export ban against Chinese mobile gear maker ZTE related to its under-the-table sales to Iran could hurt Apple (AAPL) chip suppliers Qualcomm (QCOM), Qorvo (QRVO) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), a Pacific Crest analyst wrote Wednesday.Regulators imposed the sanctions Tuesday, alleging that ZTE used four shell companies in China and Iran to ""illicitly re-export controlled items to Iran in violation of U.S. export control laws."" The ban prohibits U.S. companies from selling to ZTE.Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi opposed the sanctions, saying that ZTE's tech purchases support thousands of U.S. jobs, according to the AP. Chipmakers Cavium (CAVM), Integrated Device Technology (IDTI), Silicon Laboratories (SLAB) and Xilinx (XLNX) also sell to ZTE.""This approach will only hurt others without necessarily benefiting oneself,"" Yi said at a new conference Tuesday.ZTE isn't banned from selling products in the U.S. but cannot procure components from U.S. companies. U.S. firms can apply for an export license, but Pacific Crest analyst John Vinh sees the government unlikely to grant them.The development could shuffle the smartphone market. ZTE owns about 4% of the global smartphone market, Vinh wrote. Industry tracker IDC says that ZTE competes alongside Xiaomi and Huawei in the low-end to midrange smartphone market, vs. No. 1 smartphone vendor Samsung.Vinh expects short-term effects on chipmakers to be ""negligible."" Longer term, he says that ZTE could lose share to Huawei, Ericsson (ERIC), Alcatel-Lucent (ALU), Nokia (NOK), Siemens (SIEGY), Xiaomi, Oppo and Lenovo.""Alternatively, ZTE could conform to the U.S. embargo list, which could result in sanctions being lifted,"" he wrote.Xilinx is most at risk, with 3%-3.5% of total revenue stemming from sales to ZTE, Vinh estimates. Silicon Labs follows with 2%-2.5% of total revenue wrapped in ZTE sales.IDT, Qualcomm and Qorvo are each 2% tied to ZTE, Cavium 1%-2%, and about 1.5% of Skyworks' sales stem from the Chinese smartphone maker.Wall Street largely yawned Wednesday, however. Midday on the stock market today, only Qualcomm stock was down, dipping a fraction. Cavium stock was up a fraction. Shares of Qorvo, Silicon Labs, Skyworks and Xilinx were all up more than 1%. Integrated Device Technology stock was up more than 2.5%.

Trade was up about 15% on the Nasdaq and 20% on the NYSE vs. the previous session's pace.The Nasdaq pegged a 0.4% gain, as did the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average. The small-cap S&P 600 rose 0.9%, but the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index led the major averages with a 1.5% surge in the stock market today.Blue chips were almost evenly split between winners and losers on the Dow industrials. For the eighth day in a row, Caterpillar (CAT) stepped higher -- near midday, the stock was up 2% in volume 75% above average.Caterpillar is bumping up against resistance at its 200-day line. The stock retook its 50-day line in February. The company's revenue has declined vs. the year-earlier level for five consecutive quarters.Among stocks in the surging Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, Broadcom (AVGO) jumped 7% as it cleared a 138.79 buy point in a double-bottom base. Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) advanced 5%, though it remains 34% below its June high. Qorvo (QRVO) added 3% as it headed toward an eighth straight gain.Crude oil and gold were each up more than 1%.

266,QRVO,"Apple (AAPL) supplier Qualcomm (QCOM) quintupled its content in the Samsung Galaxy S7 smartphone as radio frequency-chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO) repeatedly lost share to rival Qorvo (QRVO), a ChipWorks teardown shows.The ChipWorks teardown was last week, but it was highlighted in a research report Monday by Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill.InvenSense (INVN), another Apple supplier, apparently lost the GS7 gyroscope to STMicroelectronics (STM). InvenSense stock was down 1.5% in midday trading on the stock market today. STMicro stock was up a fraction.Three Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) chips were completely replaced in the GS7.Key winners in getting their chips inside the new phone, besides Qualcomm and Qorvo, included NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) and Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM).Although Broadcom retained a power amplifier, rival Qorvo swiped two Broadcom components from the GS7. But Broadcom replaced a Skyworks multiband module (a power amplifier).Last week, Broadcom CEO Hock Tan bragged that the chipmaker has increased its content by 20% every year for its ""North American customer,"" which analysts said is the Apple iPhone, and that another bump is expected with the release of the next iPhone, the iPhone 7, due out in September. Meanwhile, though, Broadcom is de-emphasizing its mobile unit, which will comprise 23% of Q2 sales, down from 32% in Q1, as smartphone shipments slow amid a saturated market.Samsung lowered its own chip content in the GS7 vs. the GS6. Qualcomm took four chips (including the application processor) from Samsung and replaced Cirrus Logic (CRUS)/Wolfson on an audio chip. SK Hynix, NXP and Maxim each replaced a Samsung component.But Samsung swapped STMicroelectronics' touch controller in the GS6 for its own controller in the GS7.And Texas Instruments (TXN) lost the wireless power receiver to Integrated Device Technology (IDTI).

267,QRVO,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing's (TSM) Q2 sales are expected to inch up as Apple (AAPL) prepares to introduce its iPhone 7 -- expected in September and likely to lead to a blowout Q3 for TSM, according to analysts polled by FactSet.For Q2, analysts model TSM pulling in $6.79 billion in sales, up 2% vs. last year, and 41 cents earnings per American Depositary Receipt ex items, down 18% on a year-over-year basis. The company is slated to post Q2 earnings early Thursday, the kickoff to tech's Q2 earnings season that gets into gear next week.Wall Street's model is in line with TSM's earlier guidance for 215 billion to 218 billion Taiwan dollars, about $6.7 billion to $6.8 billion at today's exchange rate.But Q3 will be key. Samsung and TSM have been locked in a long battle to win the contract to manufacture Apple's processors. But according to several reports, Samsung stepped out of the A10 processor race, which analysts say could lead to record sales for TSM.Q3 sales expectations for $7.75 billion would be up 16% year over year. Analysts also project TSM to report 55 cents earnings per ADR minus items, which would be up 20% vs. last year and reverse four quarters of declines.TSM's U.S. stock ended down 0.3% at 26.89 on the stock market today. But shares have been in a buy zone for four days with an entry point at 26.68 reached on July 8. TSM stock hit an all-time high at 27.37 on Monday.TSM has an IBD Composite Rating of 74, meaning it outperforms nearly three-quarters of its rivals in terms of sales growth and earnings power. Texas Instruments (TXN) stock leads the Electronic Semiconductor-Manufacturing industry group with a CR of 88, where 99 is the highest possible.Fellow Apple suppliers Intel (INTC) and Qorvo (QRVO) have CRs of 80 and 79, respectively, leading Analog Devices (ADI) stock at 46.

268,QRVO,"Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Cirrus Logic (CRUS) shares nosedived Tuesday after Pacific Crest analyst Michael McConnell downgraded the stocks and predicted a 15%-20% decline in Apple (AAPL) iPhone 7 shipments later this year compared with shipments of the iPhone 6S after that product was released last September.Cirrus Logic stock closed down 6% at 35.76 on the stock market today, and Skyworks Solutions also fell 6%, closing at 58.82. Broadcom (AVGO), Analog Devices (ADI) and Qualcomm (QCOM) stocks followed, down a respective 2.2%, 2.3% and 2%.McConnell downgraded Cirrus Logic and Skyworks stocks to sector weight. He cut his price target on Broadcom to 180 from 185, on Analog Devices to 60 from 62, and on Qualcomm to 59 from 61.Cirrus Logic will benefit from Apple's transition to digital headsets, and Skyworks is likely to gain 10%-15% radio frequency content in the iPhone 7, but ""we ultimately don't believe this will be enough to offset a 15%-20% decline in iPhone 7 shipments,"" McConnell wrote in a research note, comparing it with the iPhone 6S.He has a 40 price target on Cirrus Logic stock and a 90 price target on Skyworks stock.Slowing iPhone sales will similarly slug InvenSense (INVN), Qorvo (QRVO), Synaptics (SYNA) and Texas Instruments (TXN), McConnell wrote, also cutting his estimates on these companies. Qualcomm will continue to struggle to re-sign Chinese licensees under new agreements, he said.But No. 1 chipmaker Intel (INTC), which will reportedly supply a third of the Apple iPhone 7 modems, got a price target boost to 37 from 35 on better-than-seasonal notebook forecasts for Q3, up 7%-10% sequentially vs. typical 6% growth, he said.Graphics chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) garnered higher estimates on its July GeForce 1060 launch date to compete with rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). Coupled with strong demand and higher average sales prices, Nvidia is likely to exceed its Q2 guidance, McConnell wrote.
"
269,QRVO,"Apple (AAPL) iPhone supplier Qorvo (QRVO) is better-positioned to grow than low-band radio-frequency (RF) rival Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) as infrastructure upgrades spur data usage and demand for increasingly advanced chips, Citigroup analyst Atif Malik said Thursday.Malik upgraded Qorvo stock to neutral from a sell rating on the likelihood of continued content gains in Apple's iPhone 7 following increased dollar content in Samsung's Galaxy S7 and Apple's iPhone SE. And Qorvo's high-end BAW (bulk acoustic wave) filters will be key to breaking into the carrier aggregation market.But Skyworks was downgraded, as it lacks premium filters necessary to hit the carrier aggregation market, and has seen increased competition amid dual sourcing in the low-band market.""We could become constructive on the stock is Skyworks can accelerate its diversification strategy,"" Malik wrote in a research report. ""Mobile (is) still 80% of the overall sales.""Malik cut his fiscal 2017 earnings per share view on Skyworks to 3% below broad expectations which would be $6. The consensus model of 24 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters is for $6.18. His fiscal 2017 Qorvo model is roughly in line with Wall Street for $4.90.Skyworks stock dipped 0.6% on the stock market today, trailing shares of top rivals Qorvo and Broadcom (AVGO), up less than 0.1% and 0.3%, respectively. Apple added 0.7%.On average, RF chipmaker stocks are up 20% since early May on Apple's iPhone 7 ramp-up and better-than-expected Q2 mobile demand in China, Malik wrote. He expects continued iPhone 6S inventory burn ahead of the iPhone 7 launch, expected in September.But Skyworks stock is underperforming Malik's estimate as well as IBD's 41-company Electronic-Semiconductor Fabless industry group and key competitors Broadcom and Qorvo. Since early May, Skyworks stock is up 2% vs. 24.5% and 12% increases in Qorvo and Broadcom stocks. Broadly, fabless chipmakers are up 12%.

270,QRVO,"Apple (AAPL), Samsung and other smartphone makers will need more advanced chips and antenna components as wireless service providers combine multiple radio-frequency bands to improve network capacity and data speeds, says a Citigroup report.AT&T (T), Verizon Communications (VZ)and Sprint (S) are among the wireless firms turning to “carrier aggregation,” a term for combining two or more frequency bands to provide a single communications channel with more bandwidth.This juggling act requires more complex radio frequency chips, says Citigroup. It forecasts a growing market opportunity for chipmakers Qualcomm (QCOM), Broadcom (AVGO), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS),  Qorvo (QRVO), Murata and others.Wireless firms are using carrier aggregation as mobile video traffic surges.  “Carrier aggregation is like adding more lanes to widen the highway and creating more space for more cars to travel on the highway at the same time,” says the report.While Apple designs its own antennas, there’s still a market opportunity for Amphenol and AAC Technologies to supply China-based smartphone brands, says Citigroup.Apple’s iPhone 6S series supports 23 frequency bands and the number is expected to keep growing in future devices, says Citigroup. Xiaomi’s new Mi 5 supports carrier aggregation to double its data download speeds, says the report.In the U.S., AT&T was the first to move to carrier aggregation for 4G LTE-A network upgrades, followed by Sprint and Verizon, analysts say.“According to Cisco (CSCO) (Systems), mobile data traffic is expected to grow more than 50% in the next five years,” said Citigroup. It expects more “world” phones to be built, with the ability to roam on 4G LTE networks as subscribers travel.

271,QRVO,"Intel's (INTC) dogged mobile pursuit -- to the tune of ""billions of dollars"" lost -- will pay off with an Apple (AAPL) iPhone 7 modem chip, a Barclays analyst wrote Monday as he downgraded modem rival Qualcomm (QCOM).Radio-frequency systems supplier Qorvo (QRVO) wins in the Intel model, scooping rival Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), Barclays analyst Blayne Curtis wrote in a research report. But Intel's Apple iPhone share will likely be a minority, with 10%-20%, as a second source.The No. 1 chipmaker Intel hasn't been used in an iPhone since the 2008 3G iteration. Apple last dual-sourced a key component -- the processor -- in the iPhone 6S, pitting Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) against Samsung.Samsung has since backed off the A10 processor, yielding to Taiwan Semiconductor, analysts say.Midday on the stock market today, Qualcomm stock was down more than 1.5%, while shares of Intel and Apple were little changed. Skyworks stock was up 0.8%, while Qorvo stock was down 0.4%.Figuring on 20% share of the iPhone 7, Intel would add 3 cents earnings per share ex items per quarter vs. a 13-cent Qualcomm decline, Curtis wrote. Curtis downgraded Qualcomm stock to equal weight from sector weight and cut his price target to 50 from 55.""We clearly underestimated Intel's ability to lose billions of dollars in this pursuit of mobile, but we also thought Qualcomm would make a larger effort to monetize the modem business it still has,"" Curtis wrote.Qualcomm likely won't be able to innovate back to 100% share of the iPhone modem business, Curtis wrote. Its faster modem, the Snapdragon 820, comes with a lower average sales price and higher costs.""If Qualcomm can't fix that problem, then this would be bad business for both companies unfortunately,"" Curtis wrote.On the radio-frequency side, Qorvo wins in the Intel model, gaining 3% share vs. its iPhone 6S offerings, he wrote. In an 80%/20% Qualcomm-Intel split, Qorvo gets a pair of power amplifiers and the envelope tracking chip, undercutting Skyworks.Curtis forecasts Qorvo's iPhone 7 share to rise 3% to $4.92 vs. $4.80 in the iPhone 6S. He boosted his price target on Qorvo stock to 50 from 46.But even at 50% penetration for Intel, which he calls unlikely, Skyworks still gains share, Curtis wrote. At the 80%/20% split, he expects Skyworks' iPhone 7 chip content to rise as much as 20% to $6.82 per phone, up from $5.69 in the 6s.Curtis sees Broadcom's (AVGO) contribution growing 27% in the iPhone 7 to $8.05 worth of content, vs. $6.35 in iPhone 6S. A three-year supply agreement between Broadcom and Apple will likely leave Qorvo, Skyworks and Japan's Murata Manufacturing scrambling for share, he wrote.
"
272,QRVO,"Broadcom (AVGO) stock gapped up to a 2016 high at the open Friday, after the Apple (AAPL) chip supplier late Thursday topped Wall Street's fiscal Q1 earnings-per-share expectations by 11 cents and issued Q2 guidance that edged analyst forecasts.Broadcom CEO Hock Tan hinted that Broadcom is already ramping for the likely September release of Apple's iPhone 7. He acknowledged that wireless demand declined 15% sequentially in Q1 on typical seasonality haunting ""our North American customer"" (i.e. Apple).Tan isn't alone. Last month, fellow Apple supplier Qorvo (QRVO) guided to weak Q4 sales, tugging Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) and Cirrus Logic (CRUS) into a hole. But Tan expects Q2 to be the year's ""trough.""Broadcom stock was up 7% in early trading on the stock market today, above 146, on the fiscal Q1 beat, which followed the finalized acquisition of Broadcom by the former Avago Technologies on Feb. 1. The Q1 results relate solely to the former Avago, according to the company release, as the quarter ended Jan. 31, just before the deal was finalized.For fiscal Q1, Broadcom reported non-GAAP figures of $2.41 earnings per share on $1.78 billion in sales, up 15% and 8%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier quarter. Both measures topped the consensus of 30 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters for $2.30 and $1.75 billion.During Q1, wired and enterprise storage sales grew 2% and 6%, respectively, on a sequential basis. Industrial sales fell 10% sequentially, trailing the 15% decline in wireless sales, Tan told analysts on the conference call.""Last year, we had unusually high demand in Q1 from a North American customer which offset normal seasonality,"" he said. ""This year, however -- as we all know -- seasonality returned and there was a product life cycle demand decline from that specific customer.""This week IDC issued a smartphone forecast that sees iPhone shipments declining 0.1% this year as smartphones running Alphabet's (GOOGL) Android operating system rise 7.6%.Tan said on Broadcom's conference call that he expects weak smartphone demand to reverse in the second half of 2016.Enterprise storage comprises 38% of the former Avago's total Q1 revenue -- the largest segment and leading wireless sales which contributed 32% to the total pot. But, the wired segment is growing and during the April quarter will bring in 55% of sales, Tan said.The midpoint of current-quarter guidance for $3.55 billion in sales on a non-GAAP basis, plus or minus $75 million, nearly touched the consensus model for $3.57 billion. Current-quarter sales views reflect the combined Avago-Broadcom company.During Q2, wireless and enterprise storage sales will shrink as chunks of total sales to 23% and 17%, respectively, Tan said. Still, all eyes are on Broadcom's ""North American customer"" which increased the chipmaker's RF content in its upcoming flagship smartphone, he said.""We are already pre-building significant quantities of our RF chips"" for the second-half of 2016 ramp, he said. ""We increase our RF content by 20% year after year in this high-end smartphone market.""But Tan expects greater strength in the wired segment where Broadcom expects to add new products. The segment will also benefit from increased enterprise demand.In May 2015, the former Avago announced a $37 billion bid for fellow Apple supplier Broadcom, kicking off a record-busting year of consolidation in the semiconductor industry amid macro weakness, slowing growth and ramping costs.Post-merger, the company retained Broadcom's name and Avago's ticker symbol ""AVGO."" Broadcom is one of two chipmakers on the IBD 50 list of top-rated growth stocks. The other is Tesla Motors (TSLA) partner Nvidia (NVDA).

273,QRVO,"It's looking like Christmas for chipmaker stock ETFs. Figuratively speaking, of course.With some stocks such as Nvidia (NVDA) and MaxLinear (MXL) showing stock market leadership and others near buy points, semiconductor ETFs are in the spotlight for investors.And Santa may be bringing goodies in the way of new iPhones, iPads and even -- Hallelujah! -- a mass-market Model 3 electric vehicle. Apple (AAPL) and Tesla Motors (TSLA) are expected to debut these hotly awaited products on March 21 and March 31, respectively.Tesla stock has rallied 54% off its February low, though it's squatting 25% below its 52-week high. It's the same trend for Apple stock, albeit its rally has been less decisive.Besides Nvidia, highly rated IBD chip stocks that derive some of their business from Apple include Broadcom (AVGO), IBD Leaderboard stock Macom Technology Solutions (MTSI), Cirrus Logic (CRUS) and Mellanox (MLNX).Nvidia and Broadcom are also key Tesla partners. Other chipmakers revving up their ""connected cars"" game include Mobileye (MBLY), Qorvo (QRVO), NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS).Even better, chipmakers continue to be innovative and disruptive. New markets are fueling growth. Nvidia said in its February Q4 report that it’s at the ""center of four exciting growth opportunities — PC gaming, VR (virtual reality), deep learning and self-driving cars.""""It’s a great time to operate in the semiconductor industry,"" Broadcom CEO Hock Tan said last week at an analysts' confab. “You have a substantial profit pool . . . compared to similar industries of the same size.”If you're up for a high-risk, high-reward ETF investing bet, here are four options that bypass investing in diversified technology stocks for a targeted play on the chip industry:SOXX, like the broad stock market, posted four straight weeks of gains Friday. It sank roughly 20% following a failed breakout from a cup-with-handle base in January but has advanced the same amount from its February low of 74.80.The oldest semiconductor ETF, SOXX tracks a modified cap-weighted index of global semiconductor companies listed in the U.S. Its fifth largest holding is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) and Dutch business NXP is sixth. It holds 30 stocks in total, capping portfolio weight at 8%.Dominant industry player Intel (INTC) has an 8% weighting.The ETF's 0.47% expense ratio is middle-of-the-road, while it has outperformed its peers over the past five years with an annual average 10.4% gain. Year to date through March 11, it's down 0.5%.SOXX is trading 12% off its 52-week high.SMH tracks a market-cap-weighted index of 25 of the largest U.S.-listed semiconductors companies. The average market cap of its holdings is $41.26 billion vs. $23.19 million for SOXX.Top holding Intel accounts for a 17% portfolio weighting and Taiwan Semi for 15%. The ETF is highly concentrated -- with 76% of assets in its top 10 holdings, more than any of its peers.The ETF rates well for cost metrics such as a 0.35% expense ratio, price to net asset value (NAV) and bid-ask spread.SMH does not have a five-year history but is the best-performing semiconductor ETF year to date. It's up 0.6%, unlike its peers, which have suffered mild losses.It is sitting 11% below its June high.This $202.4 million ETF is ideal for investors who wish to tilt toward smaller growth stocks and can stomach volatility. Still, it's a well-diversified fund. No single stock accounts for more than 4% of portfolio assets and it has a mere 32% of assets in the top 10 holdings -- lowest among its peers.Small-cap Monolithic Power (MPWR) accounts for a 3% portfolio weighting, as does Intel.Its holdings include stocks such as First Solar (FSLR) and SunPower (SPWR). Still, industry watcher ETF.com describes it as having the highest percentage of pure-play semiconductors in its segment.XSD shares a 0.35% expense ratio with SMH. It has produced a 9.7% annual average gain over the past five years and is down 0.3% so far in 2016.The ETF is trading 6% below its June high.PSI tracks a modified equal-weighted index designed to identify stocks within the semiconductor industry that have the potential for capital appreciation, using proprietary stock selection methods, according to S&P Global. It screens holdings based on risk factors, style classification and stock valuation.Those criteria come with a corresponding high cost -- its expense ratio is 0.63%. Portfolio turnover is at the top end too, at 50%.That might all be well if PSI delivered on beating the market. However, it trails with an 8.8% average annual gain over the past five years. Year to date, it's down 2.7%.Like XSD, it shows a small growth skew. The average market cap of its 30 holdings is $6.22 million.PSI is the only ETF in its segment to trade less than 50,000 shares a day on average. It's mired 15% below its June high.

274,QRVO,"FAA and NOAA demand for weather applications will drive approximately $500 million in additional annual revenue over the upcoming five years for IBD Leaderboard stock Macom Technology Solutions (MTSI), a Needham analyst said Friday following the chipmaker's ""upbeat"" analyst day.Macom stock rose 5.8% on the stock market today, to 43.79 -- nearing its all-time high of 44.15, achieved Monday -- and extended 5.7% from a 41.42 buy point.IBD's 41-company Electronics-Semiconductor Manufacturing industry group jumped 2.3% Friday, spurred by Macom. Shares of chip rivals Analog Devices (ADI), Qorvo (QRVO) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) -- all Apple (AAPL) suppliers -- rose 1.2%, 2.2% and 3.5%, respectively.Needham analyst N. Quinn Bolton reiterated his buy rating and 46 price target on Macom stock. Barclays boosted its price target on Macom stock to 44 from 41 and maintained an overweight rating.Optical, gallium nitride (GaN) and active antenna radar could each double Macom's approximately $500 million revenue over the next three to five years, ""potentially driving up to $2 billion of annual revenue by 2020,"" Bolton wrote in a research report.""While management was clear the team may not bat 1,000 and that timing of specific product ramps was difficult to accurately forecast, management has clearly set an objective to become a much larger company,"" he wrote.Macom’s $2.3 billion market cap puts it distantly behind industry leader Intel (INTC) and Intel’s $150 billion market cap. Unlike its Apple-supplying rivals, Macom’s chips aren't focused on consumer products but instead are used in commercial and industrial applications like cellphone base stations, military radar and lasers.Macom also is developing GaN-on-silicon chips, squaring off with privately held Transform, Infineon Technologies and Efficient Power Conversion (EPC). GaN transistors can turn on and off faster than silicon, can withstand a higher voltage and are markedly smaller.Last year, EPC figured out how to make them cheaper, too, EPC CEO Alex Lidow told IBD in February. Lidow used to head up International Rectifier, which Infineon acquired in 2014. Companies like EPC aim to use GaN in electronic components such as transistors.EPC grows a thin layer of gallium nitride on silicon wafers and, like Macom, it uses the chips in cellphone base stations.""GaN is being used in base stations, going up in Google balloons and Facebook (FB) drones,"" Lidow said. Other applications include a swallowable colonoscopy pill, autonomous cars (Alphabet (GOOGL) and Tesla Motors (TSLA) are among the competitors) and wireless charging.Lidow estimates a $370 billion total addressable market -- $30 billion in power, $40 billion in analog and $300 billion in digital.Macom is trying to grab some of it. The company has been in talks with smartphone makers Huawei, Nokia (NOK) and Ericsson (ERIC) for over a year and just recently completed customer validation, Bolton wrote.""If the commercial contract negotiations go well, management believes the company could generate first production revenue for GaN-on-Si (GaN-on-silicon power amplifiers) by year-end 2016,"" he wrote.Macom estimates that it can scoop 40%-60% of the base station power amplifier market over the next three to five years.RELATED: 5 Chip Stocks To Watch, Moving Up, With Apple's Big Event March 21

275,QRVO,"Beleaguered Marvell Technology Group (MRVL) stock pocketed a major upgrade Monday on activist investor Starboard Value's nearly 7% stake in the Bermuda-based chipmaker.Marvell stock flew almost 7% on Feb. 3, the day Starboard's investment was announced. Starboard has built its investment since December, B. Riley analyst Craig Ellis wrote in a research report.Ellis upgraded Marvell stock to buy from a sell rating. Yet, in the stock market today, shares were down 1.5%, trading near 8.80.Starboard's 6.7% stake in Marvell ""casts significant doubt on our 'sell' rating which was predicated on financial inquiry completion risks and post-review financial execution concerns,"" Ellis wrote.In October, Marvell revealed an accounting error may have shifted 7%-8% of sales to Q2, rather than Q3. Marvell's PricewaterhouseCoopers auditor resigned amid the probe. The resulting internal investigation questioned senior management's operating style.The SEC and U.S. Attorney's Office joined the investigation in December. Marvell noted it's ""common for governmental agencies to open investigations in these circumstances.""Starboard's investment isn't a panacea, but could come with several Marvell board seats, ""a tier-1 auditor and marque CFO,"" Ellis wrote. Starboard also was an investor in TriQuint before it became Apple (AAPL) supplier Qorvo (QRVO) and Integrated Device Technology (IDTI).""We believe (Starboard) knows semiconductors well, with a record of agitating for increased shareholder interest,"" he wrote.Starboard consultants include Tessera Technologies (TSRA) Chairman Rick Hill, Viavi Solutions (VIAV) CEO Oleg Khaykin and former Integrated Devices interim CEO Jeff McCreary.It's also possible Starboard could help Marvell wrangle R&D capabilities, Ellis wrote.""Past checks show undisciplined and at times ineffectual field sales and engineering,"" he wrote.At least two analysts rate Marvell stock a sell, and 21 others rate the stock as a hold. Ellis is among at least five analysts to rate Marvell stock a buy.Ellis boosted his price target on Marvell stock to 12 from 7.

276,QRVO,"Broadcom (AVGO) CEO Hock Tan satisfied querying minds Thursday, claiming that further M&A following the $37 billion merger with fellow Apple (AAPL) supplier Avago Technologies is ""furthest from our minds at this point.""Top-line growth will slow to 5% in the long term as Broadcom digests Avago, MKM analyst Ian Ing wrote today in a research report. But the merged company's diversification -- which puts wired sales on top -- will help offset a wireless trough in Q2, he said.Ing retained his buy rating and boosted his price target to 162 from 160 on Broadcom stock, which was up 7%, around 147, in afternoon trading on the stock market today, touching a 2016 high.For its fiscal Q1 ended Jan. 1 -- before the completed Feb. 1 merger -- Broadcom late Thursday reported non-GAAP figures of $2.41 earnings per share on $1.78 billion in sales, up 15% and 8%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier quarter.The consensus estimates of 30 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters were $2.30 and $1.75 billion.Current-quarter sales ex items guidance for $3.55 billion at the midpoint was slightly off the consensus model for $3.75 billion. Unlike Q1 figures, Q2 sales reflect the combined Avago-Broadcom company, Tan said on the company's earnings conference call.Pacific Crest analyst John Vinh credited Broadcom's 11-cent Q1 EPS beat to $30 million to $40 million in acquisition-related synergies. In total, Broadcom expects $750 million in synergies over 18 months. FBR analyst Christopher Rolland sees Broadcom exceeding that $750 million target.As Broadcom looks to shed smaller business units, the chipmaker expects to reduce quarterly operating expenses by $80 million. For the April quarter, Broadcom guided to $832 million in op-ex, below the consensus for $944 million, Ing wrote.Wired sales are expected to comprise 55% of Q2 revenue, leading wireless, enterprise storage and industrial sales at 23%, 17% and 5% of sales, respectively. The expectations flip Q1 results, where enterprise storage sales led with 38% of total revenue. Wireless, wired and industrial contributed 32%, 22% and 8%, respectively.During Q1, strong enterprise storage sales helped offset a 15% sequential decline in the wireless segment, Tan said. Wireless sales fell on wavering Apple iPhone demand, despite Samsung's Galaxy 7S ramp-up, but Tan expects to increase Broadcom's iPhone 7 content by 20%-plus after Q2.""Despite weaker-than-expected Q1 iPhone builds that have weighed on the entire Apple supply chain, Broadcom not only maintained its full-year RF (radio frequency) growth forecast, but raised it,"" Rolland wrote.Rolland maintained his outperform rating and 185 price target on Broadcom stock. Vinh rates Broadcom stock as overweight and has a 170 price target.Shares of fellow Apple suppliers Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), Qorvo (QRVO) and Cirrus Logic (CRUS) were up a respective 6%, 5%, 3% and 2% in afternoon trading Friday, after Broadcom's Q1 earnings.

277,QRVO," With the rising Internet of Things, connected cars and cloud computing all fostering chipmaker growth, Nvidia (NVDA) and Broadcom (AVGO) make the IBD 50 list of top-ranked growth stocks. Broadcom is set to report quarterly earnings Thursday after the market close, and it could serve as a bellwether for several other chip stocks that have moved up to or past their 50-day lines in the past couple weeks as the stock market has improved.Broadcom and Nvidia are top-ranked, with IBD Composite Ratings of 98 and a best-possible 99, respectively.Broadcom, which merged with Avago Technologies in February and kept the latter's stock symbol ""AVGO,"" moved up for five straight days before pulling back 1% in the stock market today. After the market rout last month, Nvidia has risen 30% since Feb. 11, and Avago has added 18%, compared to the S&P 500 index's 9% gain. Broadcom is still down 6% for the year, and Nvidia is flat, while the S&P has declined 3%.Analysts are looking for earnings per share of $2.30 for Broadcom's fiscal 2016 first quarter, on revenue up 6% to $1.75 billion. Nvidia's latest quarter, reported in February, brought 12% revenue growth with gains across all market platforms that the company serves: gaming, professional visualization, data center and automotive.Both Broadcom and Nvidia serve a variety of industries, and they're both Apple (AAPL) suppliers. One growing field for both is connected cars, as automakers add more entertainment and information technology, and as vehicles move closer to self-driving.At the Geneva International Motor Show underway this week, Daimler (DDAIF) showed off a self-braking and self-parking Mercedes E-Class. Tesla Motors (TSLA) is also there, and its Autopilot technology recently made an MIT Technology Review list of the top 10 technology developments for 2016.Several other chipmakers playing in car tech, among other fields, have recovered to or above their key 50-day lines in the past couple weeks. Though not as highly rated by IBD as are Nvidia and Broadcom, they include Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) with an 81 Composite Rating, Ambarella (AMBA) with a 74, Qorvo (QRVO) with a 63, and NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) with a 67.In all, Broadcom supplies analog and digital chips for uses such as data center networking, home connectivity, broadband access, telecom equipment, smartphones and base stations, data center servers and storage, factory automation, power generation and alternative energy systems, and displays.Apple's varying iPhone sales will be a factor for Broadcom.""Given an uncertain demand environment within storage and the recent iPhone inventory correction,"" Pacific Crest Securities analyst John Vinh wrote in a research note, ""we see limited revenue upside opportunities. However, we expect investors to look through to the ramp of the iPhone 7, where we anticipate over 20% content gains.""Sterne Agee analyst Doug Freedman said in a research note that Broadcom is his 2016 top-pick idea, ""as we believe the smartphone weakness is well reflected in estimates and will likely be more than offset by the consolidated business outlook going forward.""

279,QRVO,"Stocks rolled out a fast start Tuesday, boosted by a surprise jump in January construction spending.The Nasdaq popped 1%, the S&P 500 jumped 0.8%, and the Dow industrials climbed 0.7%.Early trading volume on the stock market today swept higher, up 20% on the Nasdaq and up 33% on the NYSE vs. trade at the same time Monday.Early economic news was fair to middling, with researcher Markit reporting its final February manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index at 51.3.  That was down from January's 52.4 tally but even with economists' consensus. The report said production volumes rose at their slowest pace in 28 months, and job growth moderated to a five-month low.Construction spending jumped 1.5% in January, the Commerce Department said, well above expectations for a 0.5% improvement. The department also revised December spending upward to a 0.6% gain.The Institute for Supply Management's February manufacturing index edged up to 49.5 for February. The below-50 number still denoted contraction in the sector but was above January's 48.2 reading.Of the Dow stocks, 29 of 30 rose at the start of trade. Stocks with gains of more than 1% included DuPont (DD), IBM (IBM), Goldman Sachs (GS) and Apple (AAPL).  United Technologies (UTX) reversed its premarket gain and dropped 3% as Honeywell International (HON) announced it had dropped its merger efforts after being straight-armed by UTX.Garmin (GRMN), Qorvo (QRVO), Wynn Resorts (WYNN) and Ford (F) duked it out at the head of the S&P 500, all up around 3% apiece.

Qorvo stock closed down 0.2% and is scheduled to report fiscal Q3 earnings late Thursday. Apple for its part, rose 2% on Wednesday.For its December quarter, NXP is expected to report $1.29 billion in sales and $1.07 earnings per share ex items, down 16% and 21%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier quarter.The consensus view of 25 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters was relatively in line with NXP's three-months-ago guidance for a sales decline of ""low to mid-teens,"" sequentially.For the year, analysts model $5.78 billion in sales and $5.43 EPS minus items, up 2% and 14%, respectively, vs. 2014.Hari rates NXP stock a neutral as it continues realizing synergies from its recently completed acquisition of Freescale Semiconductor.The merger reduced NXP's Apple exposure by essentially half, Hari noted. He expects NXP to mount up on its automotive content, expected to grow by 9% CAGR over the next three years. Advanced driver assistance systems, infotainment and autonomous vehicles will drive that growth.Late Thursday, Qorvo is expected to report $620.3 million in sales and 94 cents EPS ex items for its fiscal Q3. On a year-over-year basis, sales would dip 16% and EPS would be down 37%.Qorvo, Cirrus Logic (CRUS) and Dialog Semiconductor drove smartphone pressure with their negative pre-announcements late last year. Qorvo reduced its fiscal Q3 sales guide to $620 million from earlier views for $720 million to $730 million.The company didn't reduce its EPS ex items guide for $1.25 to $1.30.Hari downgraded Qorvo stock to neutral from a buy rating on its ""disadvantage to Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) ... given (Qorvo's) ongoing integration and Skyworks' ability to leverage its portfolio of adjacent analog products to provide more complete solutions to handset (smartphone-makers).""Qorvo was created in January 2015 with the merger of RFMD and TriQuint, and competes against radio-frequency (RF) chip suppliers Skyworks and Avago Technologies (AVGO).RF content in smartphones is expected to grow 9% and 14% in 2016 and 2017, Hari estimated. That's against an 0.4% decline in smartphone unit growth in 2016 vs. 1.4% growth in 2015, he wrote.Although Qorvo's portfolio is more complete post-merger, Hari questioned the timeline on synergies. The company guided to $150 million in synergies in 2017 with $75 million realized in 2015.

298,QRVO,"Two weeks before Apple's (AAPL) next quarterly earnings report, Wall Street analysts are still busy lowering their estimates for iPhone sales for upcoming quarters.Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster on Monday lowered his estimates for iPhone sales for the March and June quarters based on negative data points from Apple's Asian suppliers.Munster cut his iPhone sales estimates to 55 million units from 62.5 million in the March quarter and to 45 million units from 48.5 million in the June quarter. That would translate to year-over-year declines of 10% and 5% in the March and June quarters, respectively. He is still counting on 2% growth in the December quarter.Apple shares could rebound once uncertainty about March iPhone sales is removed, Munster said.""Given sentiment, even a March (quarter) guide implying 45 million to 50 million iPhones would likely be a relief for shares,"" he said.Apple is expected to give guidance for the March quarter when it reports December-quarter earnings after the market close on Jan. 26.""While Apple has repeatedly stated in the past that the changes in orders from any given supplier are not indicative of the health of the iPhone business overall, we believe that the combination of three supplier guidedowns (Dialog Semiconductor, Qorvo (QRVO)and Cirrus Logic (CRUS)as well as the Nikkei story suggesting production cuts from last week are too much collective evidence to not adjust iPhone expectations,"" Munster said.Munster remains bullish on Apple's prospects. He rates the company's stock as overweight with a price target of 179. Apple stock was up nearly 1%, near 99, in afternoon trading on the stock market today. Apple stock peaked last April above 134 and is down 26% since then.""Despite the potential March and June year-over-year declines in iPhone units, we believe that the back half of the year continues to set up nicely for Apple with the launch of the iPhone 7,"" Munster said.RELATED:Apple iPhone Upgrade Cycle May Wait For OLED DisplaysApple stock rises on rare positive analyst report.

303,QRVO,"Avago Technologies (AVGO) stock steamrolled the IBD Electronics-Semiconductor Fabless industry group in 2015, rocketing 45% since January on its chipmaking link to the golden smartphone goose. But other Apple (AAPL) suppliers weren't as lucky.Qualcomm (QCOM) and Qorvo (QRVO) stocks have plunged 32% and 22%, respectively, since January. Both trail their IBD performance groups in spades and face ongoing Asian headwinds that include a challenge from China's Tsinghua Unigroup to unseat Qualcomm from its No. 3 chip slot.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM), too, underperformed its IBD Electronics-Semiconductor Manufacturing industry group, by rising 2% in 2015 vs. the group's collective 3% rise.And every supplier, according to analysts, will likely feel hunger pangs as Apple appears likely to cut its orders in the typically tough March quarter while facing an iPhone sales drought.Intraday on the stock market today, nearly every Apple chip supplier dipped and Cirrus Logic (CRUS) stock led the way as shares fell about 3% ahead of the new year. Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) stock followed and was down 1.5% midday Thursday.Broadcom (BRCM) and Taiwan Semiconductor stocks, alone, managed to stay in the green and were up fractionally in midday trading.Avago's Blowout 2015Without a doubt, Avago had a blowout 2015 and consistently topped quarterly Wall Street views. The chipmaker ended its fiscal year 2015 (in November) with $8.98 earnings per share ex items on $6.9 billion in sales, up 83% and 60% vs. 2014.In December, eight analysts rated Avago stock a buy.But the company's growth is slowing. During the first half of 2015, Avago posted triple-digit earnings and sales growth. In Q3 and Q4, those numbers braked to double-digit growth. Now the consensus of 26 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters largely expects single-digit growth in 2016.The $37 billion plan to acquire Broadcom could buoy those figures. Avago announced its plan to acquire Apple rival Broadcom in May, shortly after it promised to buy data connector Emulex for $606 million in February. The deal is expected to close in Q1.Avago's Broadcom deal was one of more than $100 billion in chip sector deals in 2015. Analysts say semiconductor M&A activity will continue in 2016 as, such is Avago's plight, growth slows, competition mounts and the economy lags.Qualcomm Snagged In ChinaChinese licensing negotiations pummeled Qualcomm in 2015 and led to an internal review spurred by activist investor JANA Partners that would have seen the chipmaker split.But Qualcomm recently decided against jettisoning its licensing business. CEO Steve Mollenkopf told investors earlier this month, ""The strategic benefits of our model are not replicable through alternative structures.""That model has caused particular ire in China. Qualcomm settled an anti-monopoly suit with China's National Development and Reform Commission in February but has since struggled to collect royalties from Chinese smartphone makers.""We believe in connection with the negotiations, (some licensees) have stopped reporting certain of their sales and royalties or did not report their sales and royalties in a manner that allows us to record revenue,"" Qualcomm President Derek Aberle told investors in November.Authorities in Taiwan have since launched an antitrust investigation into Qualcomm's licensing business, following in the footsteps of similar probes in China and South Korea. The European Commission also recently alleged that Qualcomm paid a major customer to use its chips exclusively and engaged in ""predatory pricing"" to force competitors out of the market.For its fiscal Q4, Qualcomm reported an 18% dip in sales to $5.5 billion and 91 cents EPS minus items, down 28% vs. the year-earlier quarter. Both measures, however, beat the consensus model.Qualcomm ended fiscal 2015 with $25.3 billion in sales and $4.66 EPS minus items, down 5% and 12%, respectively, vs. fiscal 2014. The consensus of 36 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters currently sees Qualcomm's fiscal 2016 sales and EPS ex items dropping 8% and 11%, respectively.Connect with Allison Gatlin on Twitter @IBD_AGatlin and on Facebook.

Shares of CyberArk Software (CYBR), FireEye (FEYE) and Proofpoint (PFPT) were down about 9%, 9.5% and 10%, respectively.Shares of NXP and Ambarella were down 9.5% and 6.4%, respectively.  Apple suppliers Avago Technologies (AVGO) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) both fell more than 5% while Cirrus Logic (CRUS) and Qorvo (QRVO) were each down about 2%.Only a handful of stocks escaped the high-tech sell-off -- a continuation of a Friday deluge that saw LinkedIn stock lose nearly half its value on Wall Street after the professional networker announced a low 2016 forecast.Compounding the pressure, analysts see Big Data analytics software maker Tableau losing market share to Amazon.com (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT). Tableau, too, guided to current-quarter sales and earnings that missed the consensus expectation.Security vendors lost 7.4% and fabless chip makers closed down 4% on Friday.NXP's plunge looks incongruous after the Apple chip supplier's Q4 beat last week, but comes on a day when techs are broadly down, and amid an acquisition. In the long run, picking up Freescale is making NXP an automotive powerhouse -- sales in that segment bounded 45% year over year to $422 million.The Freescale deal also halves NXP's Apple iPhone exposure as the smartphone giant deals with floundering demand. Apple chip suppliers Cirrus Logic, Qorvo, Qualcomm (QCOM) and InvenSense (INVN) recently issued March-quarter views that lagged the consensus.At least six analysts this month have rated NXP stock a buy, including two on Monday. A Jefferies analyst boosted his price target on NXP stock to 112 from 107.Ambarella stock sank as GoPro stock rocketed 10% as of Monday afternoon on its partnership with Microsoft. GoPro and Microsoft will partner on a patent-licensing agreement for file storage and other system technologies.""This agreement with GoPro shows the incredible breadth of technology sharing enabled through patent transactions,"" Microsoft's technology licensing president, Nick Psyhogeos, said in a press release.Last week, GoPro stock wiped out after missing Wall Street's Q4 earnings views and guiding well below consensus Q1 expectations. Shares closed down nearly 9% on Feb. 4. But chip maker Ambarella missed the scrum and pulled ahead 5.1% that day.At least seven analysts cut their price targets on GoPro stock following the Q4 report. But at least three reiterated a buy rating, and another boosted his price target.Ambarella tried distancing itself from GoPro during its December quarter, instead highlighting the company's expansion into drones and home security.

307,QRVO,"Qualcomm's (QCOM) union with Japanese TDK is ""much ado about nothing,"" a Craig-Hallum analyst wrote Thursday as he reiterated a buy rating on fellow Apple (AAPL) supplier Skyworks Solutions (SWKS).The Qualcomm-TDK joint venture, announced Wednesday and expected to be completed in 2017, won't pose much threat to radio-frequency chip leaders Skyworks and Qorvo (QRVO), nor touch Avago Technologies' (AVGO) filter offerings, Craig-Hallum analyst Anthony Stoss wrote in a research report Thursday.""Despite Qualcomm's efforts, Qualcomm 360 products have been unable to match the performance, customization and integration required by handset makers,"" Stoss wrote. The products have ""gained very small traction to date.""But Qualcomm and Skyworks stocks each suffered price-target cuts Thursday on ""growing concerns over weak iPhone 6S sales,"" Stoss wrote.Apple Supplier Cuts GuidanceIn the stock market today, Skyworks closed up 3.8% at 64.54, but Qorvo stock fell 2.4% to 39.42. Qualcomm stock closed up 3.5% at 47.73.Stoss cut his price target on Skyworks stock to 100 from 125 after shares fell to a 14-month low Wednesday on Apple supplier Multi-Fineline Electronix's (MFLX) soft Q4 sales guidance.Multi-Fineline stock crashed 22% on Wednesday, hitting an 11-month low, after the company guided to $169 million in Q4 sales vs. its previous views for $170 million to $200 million. The company blamed soft smartphone sales for the floundering view. Shares rebounded 15.6% Thursday.Poor Apple iPhone sales will undoubtedly smudge Skyworks' top line, says Stoss, but he sees the company benefiting from a 15%-20% boost in RF content per unit over the next year and two-year visibility on all flagship phones.""Moreover, we believe the new features rumored to come in the iPhone 7 this fall could re-accelerate iPhone unit growth quickly, turning Apple headwinds into Apple tailwinds,"" he wrote.Meanwhile, Samsung is preparing to ramp its Galaxy S7, which should benefit Qualcomm, Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh wrote in a report Thursday. Rakesh maintained his neutral rating but dropped his price target on Qualcomm stock to 51 from 64.Qualcomm Licensing Makes U-TurnQualcomm's licensing business is also making a U-turn in China where Xiaomi, Haier, Huizhou TCL Mobile and Tianyu have signed new royalty agreements, Argus analyst Jim Kelleher wrote in a report.Re-signing outdated contracts has been an uphill battle in the wake of a settlement with Chinese authorities over an antimonopoly dispute. In September, Qualcomm reported an 18% year-over-year sales dip as a result of companies' reluctance to enter new government-approved contracts.The new contracts ""should enable Qualcomm to receive currently due and retroactive royalty and licensing payments,"" Kelleher wrote.Still, Qualcomm stock has pulled back 5% since New Year's Day after falling 33% in 2015, lagging the 8% gain of its 43-company IBD Electronic-Semiconductor Fabless industry group.But Kelleher is more positive on Qualcomm stock than is Craig-Hallum's Stoss. The market tends to overlook Qualcomm's positives and on Wednesday largely shrugged at the TDK alliance, Kelleher wrote.""In December, we wrote that, given all the M&A in semiconductors, we would not be surprised to see Qualcomm make a major acquisition,"" he wrote. ""Formation of the RF360 Holdings JV spares Qualcomm the expense of a major asset buy while positioning the company to meaningfully increase its content per device.""Kelleher maintained his buy rating on Qualcomm stock but cut his price target to 70 from 80.Connect with Allison Gatlin on Twitter @IBD_AGatlin and on Facebook.

312,QRVO,"More analysts are projecting subdued Apple (AAPL) iPhone sales over the next few quarters, causing them to reduce price targets but also maintaining a buy rating on the [PAGE[technology]] giant.Apple stock has been on a downward slide for five weeks, due largely to concerns of softer demand for its iconic smartphones.Evidence of softer demand comes from Asia-based suppliers of Apple components reporting weaker-than-average revenue growth. That's also true of Apple chip suppliers Cirrus Logic ()and Qorvo (QRVO). After the market close Thursday, Qorvo and Cirrus lowered their revenue estimates for the December quarter. Qorvo provides radio frequency chips for the iPhone, while Cirrus Logic provides audio integrated circuits and microphones.""Both these data points, along with our recent checks, suggest there is risk to Apple estimates for the March quarter, as it's our understanding that Apple curtailed orders late in December across the supply chain,"" wrote analyst Amit Daryanani of RBC Capital Markets. He maintained an outperform rating on Apple and a price target of 130.Canaccord Genuity analyst Michael Walkley on Friday cut his stock price estimate on Apple to 146 from 160 but maintained a buy rating. He lowered estimates of iPhone sales for 2016 by 12 million units to 219 million due to expectations of a slowdown in people upgrading to the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus, in addition to softer global demand for smartphones.""We anticipate a slower upgrade cycle in the first half of 2016, given macro weakness and potential for consumers to delay purchases in anticipation of the iPhone 7,"" wrote Canaccord's Walkley.Brian White, an analyst at Drexel Hamilton, fortified the view of a slowdown.""As of this morning, all of the companies in our Apple Monitor,"" which includes a basket of Apple suppliers in Taiwan, ""have reported December sales, and the performance was much weaker than typical seasonality,"" he wrote.On the other hand, White said in a [PAGE[research]] note on Friday, ""No matter how challenging trends are in the near term, we believe Apple's valuation has reached the point of absurdity,"" suggesting the stock is undervalued. White maintained a buy rating on Apple and a price target of 200.But for all the Apple bulls maintaining buy ratings, there are some bears.Analyst Jun Zhang at Rosenblatt Securities on Wednesday downgraded Apple to neutral from buy and lowered his price target to 102 from 140.""The next headwind for iPhone sales will most likely be China's slowing smartphone market,"" Zhang wrote. ""In addition, we believe the rise of Huawei in China will be the main threat to iPhone's market share, especially to their old models such as the iPhone 6 and iPhone 5S.""Apple stock rose 0.5% Friday, closing at 96.96.Follow Brian Deagon on Twitter @IBD_BDeagon.RELATED: Apple hit by another report saying it may slash production.

322,QRVO,"Apple (AAPL) supplier Avago Technologies (AVGO) might jettison its unprofitable industrial segment in lieu of a renewed focus on smartphone chips, MKM analyst Ian Ing suggests.This comes as Avago and fellow Apple chip suppliers like Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), Qorvo (QRVO), NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), Qualcomm (QCOM) and Cirrus Logic (CRUS) face continued constraints from slowing growth in the iPhone market, Ing wrote.""Avago is increasingly exposed to the challenges of cyclicality at both Apple and broader semiconductors,"" Ing wrote in a recent research report.The industry is expecting a 10%-15% decline in March-quarter iPhone sales, and a Credit Suisse analyst suggested earlier this month that Apple had cut its November orders by 10%. Shares of Apple and its suppliers tumbled on that report.Ing sees Avago as having a slim chance of guiding Q1 above the consensus when it reports its fiscal Q4 earnings after the close Dec. 2. If its guidance falls short, that would reflect hampered iPhone sales and Avago's sale of its optical module manufacturing business to China-based tech manufacturer Foxconn Interconnect Technologies, Ing wrote.He maintained his buy rating on Avago stock but dropped his price target to 158 from 159.Record-Smashing Sales, EPSFor its Q4 ended Oct. 31, Avago is expected to report a record $1.85 billion in sales, up 15% vs. the year-earlier quarter, and $2.38 earnings per share ex items, up 20%.Three months ago, Avago guided to $1.84 billion in sales, plus or minus $25 million.For the year, the consensus of 24 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters sees Avago pulling in $6.9 billion in sales and $8.84 EPS minus items, up 60% and 80%, respectively, vs. 2014 figures.Ing looks for Avago to return to aggressive M&A after it completes the Broadcom deal. In May, Avago agreed to buy Broadcom for $37 billion — the largest pure-tech merger ever until Dell and EMC (EMC) last month announced their $67 billion combination.""Much of Avago's story continues to revolve around how fast it returns to large acquisitions as it de-levers post-Broadcom,"" Ing wrote.Rampant chip sector M&A action broke records in 2015 as expenses skyrocket and growth slows. Possibly to counteract rising costs and add new vertical markets, Avago, a fabless company, submitted a winning bid earlier this month for an idle Eugene, Ore., fabrication (chip manufacturing) plant, Ing wrote.""We see this as a sign that Avago plans to have the benefits of scale and low-cost, in-sourced manufacturing as the semiconductor industry matures,"" he wrote.Avago is in IBD's Electronic-Semiconductor Fabless Group, where it has the fifth-highest Composite Rating of 92, out of a possible 99. The higher CR performers in the group are Integrated Device Technology (IDTI), ARM Holdings (ARMH), Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR) and Inphi (IPHI).Connect with Allison Gatlin on Twitter @IBD_AGatlin and on Facebook.

359,QRVO,"Cirrus Logic (CRUS) led a partial Apple (AAPL) chips recovery midday Friday after the chipmaker and rival Qorvo (QRVO) late Thursday lowered their Q3 views on slackening iPhone 6S demand, forcing the sector to plunge on Wall Street.Late Thursday, shares of Apple chip suppliers plummeted with Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Avago Technologies (AVGO) stocks leading the way. That trend reversed Friday.In early trading in the stock market today, Cirrus Logic stock was up more than 5% and trailed by Avago stock, which was up nearly 2%. Shares of Skyworks and Broadcom (BRCM) were up fractionally. Apple stock, which joined its chips in falling Thursday, was trading up about 2.5% intraday Friday.But NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) and InvenSense (INVN) felt the brunt of Qorvo's fall. InvenSense stock was down nearly 5%. Shares of Qorvo and NXP followed, down 1.5% and less than 1%, respectively.For its December quarter (fiscal Q3), Qorvo reduced its sales guide to $620 million from earlier projections for $720 million to $730 million. Revenue would be down 16% year over year, and the view missed the model of $723.7 million from 21 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters.Qorvo also expects March quarter sales to come in flat, quarter-over-quarter.Similarly, Cirrus Logic dropped its fiscal Q3 sales view to $347 million from early forecasts for between $370 million and $400 million. The estimate would be up 16% vs. the year-earlier quarter but misses analyst expectations for $385.95 million.Earbuds To Bolster Cirrus LogicCirrus Logic CEO Jason Rhode still sees meaningful growth in fiscal 2016, according to a statement. The company didn't give March-quarter guidance.Wall Street was decidedly more brutal on Qorvo. At least six analysts on Thursday and Friday cut their price targets on Qorvo stock. Cirrus Logic stock suffered at least one price target cut but also received an upgrade.At least four analysts cut their price targets on Apple stock. Rumors that Apple lowered its iPhone component orders have hounded the smartphone maker for months. On Friday, at least three analysts slashed their iPhone-shipments estimates for the January and March quarters.Pacific Crest analyst Andy Hargreaves dropped his Q1 iPhone shipments estimate to 73 million to 76 million units. Needham analyst N. Quinn Bolton lowered his Q1 and Q2 estimates to 70 million and 45 million iPhones shipped, respectively. Canaccord analyst T. Michael Walkley now expects 46 million shipments in Q1 and 45 million in Q2.Cirrus Logic is more Apple-exposed with 60%-65% of sales stemming from iPhone content, Credit Suisse analyst John Pitzer wrote in a research report. But Cirrus Logic is apt to benefit from Apple's likely iPhone 7 headphone jack revamp and noise-canceling headphones, Pacific Crest analyst John Vinh wrote in a report.""Apple needs a compelling feature upgrade, which noise-canceling earbuds would provide,"" Vinh wrote. Other reports suggest that Apple will swap its headphone jack for a Lightning cord-compatible set of earbuds in an effort to create the thinnest smartphone to date.Vinh called the gouge on Cirrus Logic stock a ""buying opportunity"" and upgraded shares to an overweight rating with a 40 price target. Vinh rates Qorvo stock as sector weight.Qorvo: 'In The Penalty Box'Qorvo, on the other hand, is 35%-40% sales-dependent on Apple, Pitzer wrote. But Thursday was Qorvo's second top-line miss in six months as ""peers Avago and Skyworks have continued to beat and raise estimates,"" Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh wrote in a report.Some of Qorvo's miss could be due to an oversized September-quarter ramp-up, which likely built inventory into the already shaky supply chain, Rakesh wrote. Still, he prefers Avago stock, which he lists with a buy rating and a 175 price target.""We believe Qorvo could be in the penalty box with investors near-term,"" he wrote. ""We continue to favor Avago with strong executive, visibility, free cash flow and diversification.""But even Avago expects its Q1 sales to be down 4.5% sequentially at the midpoint of guidance.Analog Devices, too, cut its January-quarter forecast to indicate a 15% quarter-over-quarter revenue slump. German Apple-supplier Dialog Semiconductor, too, trimmed $50 million from its fiscal Q4 sales view in December.But Avago is, uniquely, not at risk, Vinh wrote. He rates Avago stock as overweight and has a price target of 170 on shares.""Avago took its iPhone 6S medicine early,"" he wrote. ""With a clear line of sight to 20% content growth in the iPhone 7 . . . and the closure of the Broadcom merger around the end of the quarter, we would be buyers of Avago.""Connect with Allison Gatlin on Twitter @IBD_AGatlin and on Facebook.

424,QRVO,"Apple's (AAPL) iPhone ""elephant in the room"" clouded Qorvo's (QRVO) otherwise upbeat analyst day, an MKM analyst wrote late Tuesday as he suggested that the chipmaker might be considering a hefty M&A play.Qorvo stock closed up 5.6% in the stock market today at 54.74.March-quarter expectations for a 10%-15% depression in iPhone sales remained unchanged, MKM analyst Ian Ing noted in a research report. Ing retired his 71 price target and buy rating on Qorvo stock.""With the iPhone 'elephant in the room,' we felt investor concerns regarding a smartphone unit slowdown remained only partially addressed and not in Qorvo's control,"" Ing wrote.Slower growth rates are still likely out of China, he added.But Qorvo's overall outlook was positive, Ing wrote. The company revised its long-term target model to 32%-35% vs. an earlier 30% target and outlined plans to recapture Samsung and MediaTek smartphone share in China.A recent $1 billion debt issuance could signal that Qorvo's Industrial and Defense Products segment is becoming acquisitive, Ing wrote. Strategic M&A could help Qorvo's IDP business grow at twice the industry's 7% growth rate.Qorvo would merely be the latest in a series of recently acquisitive chip companies. Last month, Lam Research (LRCX) agreed to acquire KLA-Tencor (KLAC), a combination that might overtake Applied Materials' (AMAT) market share, and Western Digital (WDC) made a bid for SanDisk (SNDK).Earlier this year, Intel (INTC) agreed to buy Altera (ALTR), and Avago Technologies (AVGO) announced its plan to acquire Broadcom (BRCM).Connect with Allison Gatlin on Twitter @IBD_AGatlin and on Facebook.

428,QRVO,"If individual investors hope to succeed in the stock market, they must adjust their tactics to market conditions. A volatile market requires close attention. Profit-taking strategies must be acted upon quickly, before the gains disappear.France-based Criteo (CRTO) began sketching a base-on-base pattern in February. The digital ad service provider's stock cleared the 46.60 buy point May 14 (1), which happened to be a follow-through day.A follow-through confirms that a new uptrend has started in the stock market.Investors should buy something on a follow-through day, even if it's only to test the uptrend.Criteo was a good choice. Earnings had jumped by triple-digit percentages in five of the previous six quarters. Revenue leapt 75% to 35% in the same quarters. The relative strength line was at a new high, indicating that the stock was outperforming the S&P 500.The market had been in a choppy pattern all year. This meant a smooth ascent was unlikely, even for a top stock.Criteo gained about 8% in strong volume in the first three sessions after breaking out. Then it fell to 2% under the ideal buy point, but volume was soft. Next, the stock surged 10% above the buy point in above-average volume. And then it dived almost 6% under the ideal entry to test the 50-day line.A bounce off the line and close in the upper half (2) pointed to institutional support.Criteo found traction in mid-June and advanced even as the market continued its choppy action.Criteo rose July 22 to almost 22% above the 46.60 buy point (3), reaching a profit-taking zone.Given the choppy market, this was a good time to sell. Most stocks begin to consolidate after a 20% to 25% gain.If an investor didn't sell at a 22% gain, another reason to sell developed later. Criteo was scheduled to report quarterly results Aug. 4. However, the market had reacted viciously to other companies' reports in late July.Tableau Software (DATA) beat on earnings and revenue but dropped 11% on July 29. Qorvo (QRVO) reported July 30, beating on earnings and revenue but plunging 14%. Outerwall (OUTR) reported July 31, beating on earnings but missing on revenue and skidding 13%.An investor who witnessed this punishing climate could've sold Criteo for an 11% to 14% gain.On Aug. 4, Criteo beat on revenue but missed earnings.

European chipmakers posted the smallest Q2 billings at $500 million, a 7% decline vs. the year-ago quarter.Chinese chipmakers, who've faced a series of recent headwinds including the devalued yuan, posted a small 1% increase vs. Q2 2014, to $1.04 billion in billings.Overall, worldwide billings reached $9.4 billion, down from $9.6 billion in Q2 2014.

773,QRVO,"Qorvo CEO Bob Bruggeworth is leading a new management team working to integrate two chipmakers' products and cultures, leverage their combined strengths and define long-term technology and product road maps.He'll draw on 31 years of experience to accomplish the challenge.The name Qorvo (QRVO) might not ring a bell. RF Micro Devices, also called RFMD, agreed in February 2014 to acquire TriQuint Semiconductor for about $1.6 billion.The deal, billed as a merger of equals, culminated a five-year courtship. The pair officially merged as of Jan. 1 under the new name.Qorvo battles Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Avago Technologies (AVGO) among the top radio-frequency chip suppliers.Bruggeworth first delved into semiconductors while building transistors in college.""Most of my classes were taught by professors who worked at an RCA fab,"" Bruggeworth said.He started his career in 1983 at Santa Ana, Calif.-based Accelerated Memory Production, or AMP, where he began working on sockets for integrated circuits.""Before I left AMP to join RF Micro Devices in 1999, I was responsible for AMP's global computer and consumer electronics business based in Hong Kong,"" he said. He moved to RF Micro for ""the opportunity to move from wired to wireless technologies.""In June 2002, Bruggeworth was named president of RF Micro Devices. Seven months later, he added the CEO title.Bruggeworth recently spoke with IBD about Qorvo, which is set to release Q4 earnings after the close Wednesday.IBD: What's the merger's goal?Bruggeworth: We see the merger creating a new leader in RF (radio-frequency chip) solutions. Qorvo is highly diversified, with greater than $2 billion in annualized revenue and expertise in mobile devices, complex infrastructure and global defense applications. These are robust markets with strong long-term prospects, and we have a goal of outpacing our markets' underlying growth rates of approximately 10% to 15%. We've assembled a world-class team with a legacy of innovation and a sharp focus on superior financial results, and we believe we can achieve our target operating model of 50% gross margin and 30% operating margin within two years while posting above-market growth.IBD: Why the name Qorvo?Bruggeworth: Since this was a merger of equals, we wanted to create a new name for the company. Qorvo (pronounced ""kor-vo"") isn't a name that existed before, so we have an opportunity to create a new brand from a clean sheet of paper.The name combines the words ""core"" and ""voyage."" Qorvo delivers the core technologies so that our customers can launch their next-generation designs faster. The second part of the name, ""vo"" for ""voyage,"" evokes moving through air or space.IBD: How do the two companies' technologies and products complement one another?Bruggeworth: RFMD and TriQuint served many of the same markets and had developed some very complementary technologies. We have core strengths in system design, semiconductor processing, advanced packaging, high-volume manufacturing and strategic foundry services, and we are capable of serving both high-volume commercial and defense customers.That said, there was surprisingly little overlap in our product portfolios. So as Qorvo, we can combine our many strengths — in areas like premium filters, switches, antenna tuners, power amplifiers and power management — to offer our customers RF solutions that are much more highly integrated and much more valuable.IBD: Will the companies have one headquarters at RF Micro's home base in Greensboro, N.C.?Bruggeworth: Qorvo will have dual headquarters in Greensboro and (TriQuint's home base) Hillsboro, Ore. We're a global company with dozens of locations and thousands of customers around the world. Our leadership team is distributed across Greensboro and Hillsboro, as well as in other locations globally, and we use technologies like TelePresence videoconferencing to help bridge time and distance, and create a sense of being in one location.IBD: What is your goal in cost savings?Bruggeworth: We are committed to $150 million in cost synergies within two years of the merger; $75 million in annualized synergies exiting the first year after closing; and an additional $75 million exiting the second year.IBD: What are market trends and your revenue drivers looking like?Bruggeworth: The underlying trends in the markets we serve — mobile, infrastructure and defense — are positive, particularly in the applications we make possible. The demand for mobile data is growing, and Qorvo is very well positioned with the core technologies necessary to help our customers accelerate their products to market.Whether you're talking about mobile devices, radar/avionics systems or communication infrastructure like base stations, point-to-point radio links or optical and cable networks, Qorvo is helping to connect people, networks and things, both wirelessly and over wired networks.IBD: As smartphones become more complex, is more RF content needed? Premium filters, switches and modules?Bruggeworth: Yes. Half of the world's handsets shipping today are 2G and average significantly less than $1 of RF content. With the increasing global demand for mobile data and the migration to 4G, that's increasing to significant dollars of RF content per device over a multiyear period.Consumers in all geographies want their mobile devices to deliver longer battery life, broader coverage, increased throughput, greater functionality and overall improved performance.To achieve this, smartphone manufacturers are adding new LTE bands to their devices, and the cellular industry is supporting new technologies, like envelope tracking, carrier aggregation and, later, transmit MIMO (multiple input multiple output, an antenna technology for wireless communications in which multiple antennas are used at both the source \ and the destination \) to enrich the user experience.For Qorvo, that's driving incremental demand for our RF content, primarily premium filters, switches and tuners, as well as our power amplifiers.

776,QRVO,"With the market in a confirmed uptrend, most stocks should advance. But investors should look for the true market leaders, such as Skyworks Solutions (SWKS).IBD's Screen of the Day, Bolting RS Lines, separates the wheat from the chaff. It focuses on top-rated companies whose relative strength lines are rising to new highs. A rising RS line means the stock is outpacing the benchmark S&P; 500 index.Skyworks has advanced for the past six sessions, rising 2% Monday to a new closing high of 82.48 on the stock market today. Even more impressive, Skyworks has reported nine straight quarters of accelerating earnings per share growth, including last week's Q1 2015 gain of 88%. Sales growth has picked up for four straight quarters.Skyworks shares have been on a tear since finding support just above its 200-day moving average on Oct. 10. Its RS line has been hitting new highs since early November.Skyworks makes radio frequency chips used in the Apple (AAPL) iPhone 6, Samsung Galaxy GS5 as well as many other wireless devices and in other industries. Apple reports earnings Tuesday night, with analysts raising iPhone 6 sales targets.Centene (CNC) is a leading health insurer, focusing on Medicaid programs. It's benefited from the ObamaCare Medicaid expansion as well as winning more state Medicaid contracts.Centene said Monday it will buy Oregon-based Agate Resources , which provides some Medicaid, Medicare Advantage and ObamaCare exchange coverage in the state.Q4 earnings likely doubled (101%) in Centene's next report due in early February, accelerating from the prior quarter's 37% advance. Centene shares cleared a short consolidation base last week, hitting a record intraday high on Friday. Its RS line hit a new high ahead of the stock, a bullish sign.Shares rose 1.2% to 111.80 on Monday, a new closing high.Several other health insurers are on the Bolting RS Lines screen — though not in the top 5 — including UnitedHealth Group (UNH) and Cigna (CI). UnitedHealth earnings beat estimates last week as medical costs remained tame.Next on the Bolting RS Lines' top 5 is Qorvo (QRVO), another RF chipmaker. The name may not be familiar, but it's forged from the recent merger of RF Micro Devices and Triquint Semiconductor. The Apple iPhone 6 also boasts Qorvo chips. Qorvo rose to a new high Friday after clearing a 3-week consolidation following a rapid ascent. Qorvo stock fell a fraction Monday.Rounding out the top five are Electronic Arts (EA) and Alaska Air Group (ALK). Alaska is one of three airline stocks on the Bolting RS Lines screen, along with Southwest Airlines (LUV) and Delta Air Lines (DAL).Follow Ed Carson on Twitter: @IBD_ECarson.

""It will take several years for China to disrupt new semiconductor markets, but disruptions — notably margin risk — could end up being significant for established players and for the global chip market overall.""Morgan Stanley analysts said China is not spreading its investments broadly, but instead pushing for ""national champions"" in semiconductor segments.""These include one national manufacturing champion Semiconductor Manufacturing International, one assembly subcontractor (Jiangsu Changjiang Electronics Technology), likely local DRAM (dynamic random-access memory) and Nand flash-memory production and one semi equipment company and a few fabless companies such as Spreadtrum Communications and HiSilicon,"" according to Morgan Stanley's report.Opportunities for non-Chinese firms include partnerships such as the one that Intel (INTC) has with Spreadtrum Communications and Rockchip Electronics, and Qualcomm 's (QCOM) joint venture with Semiconductor Manufacturing International.Morgan Stanley analysts also expect opportunities for chip technology licensing companies such as ARM Holdings (ARMH) to find new customers and for chip equipment makers to find new customers.

That's a fitting reflection of what you find in the Big Cap 20. Most of the 20 stocks can be categorized in one of those areas.In technology, a couple of chipmakers rank among the leading big caps, along with some business-service tech companies.Analog Devices (ADI) is one of the more interesting charts. The stock broke out of a cup-shaped base on Feb. 17 and has risen 3% from that entry.The chipmaker earned 63 cents a share excluding items for the January-ended quarter, beating expectations. Sales rose 23%, as the top line continued an accelerating trend of growth.Analysts noted strength in its industrial and automotive markets.Apple (AAPL), a tech leader that could be viewed as a consumer stock too, is another high-tech stock that's found a home in the Big Cap 20. The stock is near new highs, extended from its breakout past 119.85 last month.In the medical sector, drugmakers Biogen Idec (BIIB), Pharmacyclics (PCYC) and Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) have rallied in recent weeks and account for some of the best percentage gains in the Big Cap 20 over the past couple of weeks.UnitedHealth Group (UNH) and Cigna (CI) are part of a broad rally in HMO stocks.While those medical leaders are extended, Mylan (MYL) is setting up in a base with a 59.70 buy point.However, its shares fell moderately after the close Monday, when the company reported Q4 earnings of $1.05 a share, an increase of 35%. Sales rose 18% to $2.08 billion.Mylan forecast 2015 revenues of $9.6 billion to $10.1 billion.In consumer stocks, the big cap leaders run the gamut of auto-parts chain O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY), Starbucks (SBUX) and discount retailer Ross Stores (ROST).Ross Stores shined Friday as its earnings report sent shares gapping up to a 7% gain and a record high.For the first two months of 2015, the Big Cap 20 has acquitted itself quite satisfactorily. It rose 6.9%, far better than the 2.2% gain for the S&P 500, which is a broad gauge of big-capitalization stocks.Qorvo (QRVO) may be an unfamiliar name on a list filled with familiar brands.

943,QRVO,"With a huge growth opportunity in China and strong stock gains this year, the biggest challenge facing Qorvo right now might be educating people on how to spell and pronounce the company name.

976,QRVO,"Qorvo, Inc. (QRVO  -  Free Report) recently announced the pricing of $500 million of convertible unsecured senior notes to enhance liquidity. The notes are slated to mature in 2026. The notes will be privately offered to institutional buyers qualifying under Rule 144A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.Notably, the size of the offering was increased from the previous offering of $300 million. Subject to customary closing conditions, the sale of these notes to initial buyers is expected to be completed on Jul 16, 2018. These notes, once placed, will be an unsecured senior liability of Qorvo, interest for which will be paid in arrears semi-annually at a rate of 5.5% per year.The company will use the proceeds to fund a tender offer for any or all its 6.75% notes due 2023 and redeem 7% senior notes worth up to $300 million due 2025.

977,QRVO,"The United States formally imposed the first set of tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese imports on Jul 6. The trade war has finally been triggered, with China firing counter tariffs on an equal amount on imports from the United States.And if President Donald Trump does what he said he will do, the war will only intensify, with his additional tariffs that could reach an estimated worth of $500 billion Chinese goods. It now needs to be seen, who gains and who loses from the trade war, given that both countries have drawn up a long list of goods and services that will be impacted by higher import duties.Relief for Domestic Steel, Aluminum ManufacturersIn March, Trump announced tariffs of 25% and 10% on imported steel and aluminum, respectively, from China. The announcement came with the objective of protecting domestic steel and aluminum industry by increasing production, which will eventually help create more jobs.Trump’s decision was cheered by domestic steelmakers, as they stand to benefit from the newly imposed tariffs. On Thursday, shares of United States Steel Corporation X and Nucor Corporation NUE jumped 3.1% and 2.1%, respectively, while Steel Dynamics, Inc. STLD surged 3.3%. United States Steel Corporation has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Similarly, shares of Alcoa Corporation (AA  -  Free Report), Kaiser Aluminum Corporation (KALU  -  Free Report) and Century Aluminum Company (CENX  -  Free Report) jumped 2.4%, 1% and 0.2%, respectively, on Thursday.Manufacturing Sector to Suffer                                         American companies that earn huge revenues from China or sell products to that country will be hit by tariffs of 15% to 25%. Heavy equipment manufacturers and airplane makers are at the highest risk. Last year, The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) earned 13% of its revenues from China. Moreover, the company also entered into a deal with a state-run Chinese company to sell 300 planes for $37 billion.Excavator and earth-moving manufacturing company Caterpillar, Inc. (CAT  -  Free Report) has more than 20 facilities in China. Other heavy-equipment manufacturers like Deere & Company (DE  -  Free Report) too will be hit hard as it will find it hard to manufacture equipment with higher-priced steel.Tough Time for Automakers Not only the automakers but the overall auto sector, comprising carmakers, auto parts and transportation companies will bear the brunt of tariffs. For them, the tariffs are more like a double-edged sword. While producing vehicles in the United States will attract higher tariffs in China, producing vehicles in China and importing them back to the United States means paying higher import duty.Almost 30% of General Motors Company’s (GM  -  Free Report) U.S. unit sales are imported from Mexico and China, Ford Motor Company (F  -  Free Report) imports 20% of its vehicles from these two countries. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V. (FCAU  -  Free Report) manufactures almost 50% of its vehicles in the United States, while the rest is imported from its Mexico and Canada plants. Tech Companies to Take a HitMany tech companies earn a significant portion of their revenues from China. Thus, a trade war will definitely affect tech companies, particularly chipmakers with significant exposure to China.The United States is the largest semiconductor manufacturing country, with China being its biggest market. Higher tariffs will take a toll on the revenues of these semiconductor manufacturers. Qualcomm has tie-ups with a large number of Chinese companies, including Huawei. Qorvo, Inc. (QRVO  -  Free Report) too generates almost 60% of its revenues from China.Similarly, other semiconductor giants like Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (SWKS  -  Free Report) and Qualcomm depend heavily on the Chinese market. In fact, Apple and Intel Corporation INTC are among the top 16 U.S. companies that generated a total of $105.5 billion from China in 2017. Qualcomm, Broadcom Inc. (AVGO  -  Free Report) and NVIDIA Corporation NVDA generated respectively 16.6%, 9.5% and 1.9% of their revenues from China.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge. With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research. It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

978,QRVO,"Qorvo, Inc. (QRVO  -  Free Report) has declared the early results of its previously announced offer to purchase for cash (the ""Tender Offer""), any or all of its outstanding 6.75% Senior and 7.00% Senior Notes worth up to $150 million. The notes are due in 2023 and 2025, respectively, subject to specific terms and conditions. Notably, these are popularly known as “the Notes.”The company also declared results in connection with the previously announced Tender Offer for the 2023 Notes. In this regard, the company stated solicitation of consents to amend certain provisions, related to the indenture, as of Nov 19, 2018, among “the Company, the guarantors party thereto and MUFG Union Bank, N.A., as trustee.”The company also extended its early tender date for the 2025 Notes. The Tender Offer will now expire at midnight, NY time, on Jul 13, 2018, unless extended or earlier terminated by the company.Per the announcement, Qorvo will pay to each holder of record of Notes, who delivered a valid consent, a cash fee for each $1,000 principal amount of 2023 Notes, subject to terms and conditions of theTender Offers and the Consent Solicitation.Wells Fargo Securities, Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and BofA Merrill Lynch were appointed as joint lead deal managers for the tender offer solicitation agents by Qorvo.Shares of Qorvo have returned 27.3% year to date outperforming the industry’s rally of 3.6%.Balance Sheet & Cash FlowAs of Mar 31, the company’s cash and cash equivalents were $926 million compared with $841.3 million as of Dec 30. Long-term debt was $983.3 million as compared with $1.09 billion at the end of the previous quarter.Net cash provided by operating activities was $259 million down from $270.1 million in the previous quarter. Capital expenditures declined sequentially to $32 million.To ConcludeThe company is benefiting from increasing demand in the performance-tier for RF Flex and RF Fusion based solutions as well as for antenna tuning, discrete components and BAW-based multiplexers. Improved demand environment in China is a positive. Expanding portfolio also bodes well for Qorvo. The company’s 5G and GaN solutions hold promise. It is well poised to seize growth opportunities that the corresponding markets offer.However, Qorvo depends on a handful of customers including Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) and Huawei to sustain revenues. To add to the woes, Apple’s self-reliance strategy is a looming threat. Moreover, the company operates in a competitive landscape which is intensifying further due to with low barriers to entry. The increased competition is exerting pricing pressure which remains a matter of concern for the company.Qorvo’s top-line growth is significantly dependent on iPhone’s growth trajectory. We also note that Qorvo’s share price movement depends heavily on Apple’s results, which doesn’t bode well for the investors.In order to sustain its market position, Qorvo has to constantly come up with new products. Consequently, higher spending on product development is likely to keep margins under pressure at least in the near term.Zacks Rank & Key PicksQorvo has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).A couple of better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) and Micron Technology, Inc. (MU  -  Free Report), both sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

979,QRVO,"The U.S-China trade spat has started taking its toll on tech companies, particularly chipmaker stocks. On Jun 19, President Donald Trump asked the United States Trade Representative to identify Chinese goods worth $200 billion for additional tariffs. Consequently, China too said that it would have to take comprehensive measures to counter U.S. trade moves.This has resulted in stocks tumbling once again. Given that China accounts for a large portion of revenues for a number of U.S. tech companies, which include chipmakers, mobile phones and technology-based service providers, there are high chances of these players suffering significantly.Trade War Fears EscalateOn Jun 15, Trump announced tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese goods including semiconductors. China wasted no time in retaliating with tariffs on $34 billion U.S. goods. Markets were further rattled on Jun 19, after Trump asked the United States Trade Representative to identify Chinese goods worth $200 billion for additional tariffs of 10%.This further escalated trade war fears, resulting in huge sell offs. Tech stocks have been suffering particularly as China accounts for a large portion of revenues for a number of U.S. companies.Apple Fears the Worst Bite Trump’s announcement of 25% tariffs on up to $50 billion of Chinese goods including semiconductors could make Apple, Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) one of the biggest victims of a U.S.-China trade war. Apple is the most successful U.S. tech company in China. In 2017, the iPhone maker generated approximately 20% of its revenues from China, shipping more than 41 million iPhone to China in 2017. Moreover, Apple operates its services like Apple Music and App Store in China.  A trade war could result in China banning Apple’s services, which it did in 2016 by shutting down iTunes Movies and iBooks Store. Services are becoming an integral part of Apple’s business in a slowing smartphone market. Another increasing concern is: what if China bans Apple citing concerns of national security just like the United Stated cautioned customers not to buy Chinese mobile phone maker Huawei on fears of being spied by the Chinese? This would hurt Apple’s business severely. Shares of Apple declined 1.6% on Jun 19.Chipmakers to Bear the BruntChipmakers with significant exposure to China were hit on Tuesday, following Trump’s announcement of 25% tariffs on semiconductors. Telecommunication equipment maker Lumentum Holdings Inc.’s (LITE  -  Free Report) shares tumbled 3%, while Qualcomm Incorporated (QCOM  -  Free Report) plummeted 0.8%.The United States is the largest semiconductor manufacturing country, with China being its biggest market. Naturally, higher tariffs will take a toll on the revenues of these semiconductor manufacturers. Qualcomm has tie-ups with a large number of Chinese companies, including Huawei. Qorvo, Inc. (QRVO  -  Free Report) too generates its almost 60% of its revenues from China. The company’s shares tumbled 2.7% on Tuesday.Similarly, other semiconductor giants like Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (SWKS  -  Free Report) and Qualcomm too depend heavily on the Chinese market. In fact, Apple and Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report) are among the top 16 U.S companies that generated a total of $105.5 billion from China in 2017. Qualcomm, Broadcom Inc. (AVGO  -  Free Report) and NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) generated respectively 16.6%, 9.5% and 1.9% of their revenues from China. Shares of Skyworks, Intel, Broadcom and NVIDIA declined 1.6%, 0.5%, 0.7% and 1.9%, respectively, on Tuesday. NVIDIA sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Bottom LineTech stocks have been driving markets for a while now. However, the U.S.-China trade spat has been rattling markets, with tech stocks, particularly semiconductors, at the helm of the carnage. Tech companies depend heavily on China, which accounts for a large portion of their revenues, and retaliatory tariffs would make things worse that they already are.  Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%. And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

980,QRVO,"Qorvo Inc. (QRVO  -  Free Report) is set to release first-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings on Aug 2.The company has a mixed record of earnings surprises. Despite missing two of the trailing four quarters, Qorvo has delivered an average positive surprise of 1.38%.In the last quarter, the company’s earnings (including stock-based compensation) were 74 cents per share, which was in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, adjusted revenues of $643 million lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $645 million.Qorvo expects non-GAAP revenues in first-quarter fiscal 2018 to be approximately $610–$650 million. Earnings are expected to be in the range of 70–90 cents per share. The company also provided optimistic view for fiscal 2018. Qorvo, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Qorvo, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Qorvo, Inc. QuoteNevertheless, Qorvo underperformed the industry on a year-to-date basis. While the stock has returned 30.9%, the industry gained 33.6%.The underperformance can be attributed to sluggish results that were negatively impacted by high inventory levels with handset manufacturers due to lower demand in China. Moreover, a reported delay in the launch of Apple’s (AAPL  -  Free Report) iPhone 8 also affected the stock price.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderNotably, China accounts for almost 35% of Qorvo’s revenues. Per market research firm GFK, the overall growth of China’s smartphone will slow down in 2017, primarily due to depreciation of the yuan, rising cost of components and increasing competition.According to its latest report, smartphone demand in China remained flat on a year-over-year basis at 110.1 million units in the second-quarter 2017. We believe that sluggish demand level in China will continue to impact Qorvo’s results in the going-to-be reported quarter.However, improving market share at Samsung and Huawei – both  accounting for more than 10% customers in the last quarter – is positive. Management expects opportunities at Samsung to grow sequentially in the second quarter. Moreover, strong adoption of the latest Bulk Acoustic Wave (BAW) 5 product is expected to drive growth in the quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Qorvo is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Qorvo’s Earnings ESP is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 61 cents per share. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Qorvo has a Zacks Rank #3 which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Kemet Corporation (KEM  -  Free Report) with an Earnings ESP of +11.11% and sports a Zacks Rank #1.

981,QRVO,"Qorvo, Inc. (QRVO  -  Free Report) recently launched five new 5G products. The enhanced 5G infrastructure solutions portfolio now comprises two new integrated front end modules (FEMs) — QPB9329 & QPB9319 — and a wideband driver amplifier — QPA9120. The other two new 2-stage power amplifiers are QPA4501 & QPA3506.The small-sized, highly integrated and efficient new FEMs support frequency bands ranging from 3GHz (gigahertz) to 39GHz. The FEMs can function on both pre-5G and 5G architecture. Qorvo’s gallium nitride (GaN) technology has enabled it to support the emerging 5G infrastructure.The company is demonstrating its advanced RF portfolio at IMS from Jun 12-15.Per an EJL research report, shipments for massive MIMO driving radio transceivers are envisioned to reach 500 million units by 2022. Per Qorvo estimates, the market for massive MIMO base station is projected to yield $1 billion by 2022 in RF solutions. The company’s expanding RF product portfolio pertaining to 5G and massive MIMO base stations bodes well in the long haul.Prior to this launch, Qorvo had announced two other amplifiers, namely QPF4005 and QPF4006, which it claims to be industry’s first GaN FEMs for 39GHz. In the previous quarter, the company had launched the industry's first 28 GHz GaN on silicon carbide (SiC) FEM for base stations. Notably, the 28GHz product supported the demonstration of Samsung 5G MIMO at the 2018 Winter Olympics.The company has participated in dozens of 5G field trials and demonstrations. We believe an expanding portfolio enabling 5G deployment augurs well for the company.Shares of Qorvo have returned 21.3% year to date outperforming the industry’s rally of 6.4%.New GaN FEMs for Defense ApplicationsIn a separate press release, Qorvo announced that it has launched two new X-band FEMs that find ample application in active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar. The two GaN FEMs, namely QPM2637 and QPM1002 are very compact and EAR99 export-compliant.

The products are under sampling to eligible customers.Per Strategy Analytics data, as revealed in the press release, the demand for RF front end components pertaining to radar applications is projected to surpass $1 billion by 2022, implying a CAGR of 9% over the next five years. The RF GaN devices market for defense applications is expected to grow at a CAGR of 24% over the next five years due to the impressive adoption rate of GaN which is likely to outpace other technology variants.Moreover, according to a MarketsandMarkets report, the GaN power device market is projected to grow at CAGR of 29.1% to reach $1.89 billion by 2023. The base year 2017 valuation was $0.408 billion and the time period under consideration is 2017-2023.Introduction of the new products strengthens Qorvo’s GaN portfolio and provides it a competitive edge, in the relevant market. The company is capitalizing on the lucrative prospects in defense by rendering effective GaN solutions.To ConcludeExpanding portfolio bodes well for Qorvo. The company’s 5G and GaN solutions hold promise. The company is well poised to seize growth opportunities that the corresponding markets offer.However, customer concentration, particularly from Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) and Huawei remains a significant headwind for Qorvo.Zacks Rank & Key PicksQorvo has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A couple of better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Western Digital Corporation (WDC  -  Free Report) and Micron Technology, Inc. (MU  -  Free Report), both sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Western Digital and Micron have a long-term expected EPS growth rate of 19% and 10%, respectively.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

The company delivered a positive surprise of 5.63% in last reported quarter.Revenues on a non-GAAP basis increased 2.4% year over year to $844.8 million, reflecting an improved demand environment in China.

The investment firm, in its Mar 27 note, announced trimming iPhone sales expectations by a whopping 1.7 million units to 53 million, for the March quarter.The production cut is likely to hurt Qorvo’s top-line in the quarter.Moreover, China accounts for almost 30% of Qorvo’s MP segment revenues. Per market research firm GFK, smartphone demand in China decreased 6% in first-quarter 2018, while average selling price (ASP) increased year over year.Although the improving price environment bodes well for Qorvo’s top-line growth, lower shipments due to sluggish demand are a concern. GFK forecasts smartphone demand in China to decline by 4% in 2018 as the market becomes more saturated.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for MP segment is currently pegged at $453 million.Infrastructure and Defense (IDP): Key CatalystQorvo’s IDP segment is benefiting from strong demand for its solutions that are used in the Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G end-markets. Notably, Smart Home revenues in the last-reported quarter surged 30% year over year.Qorvo is the only company to support Thread, ZigBee 3.0, ZigBee RF4CE and ZigBee Green Power in a single radio. The company’s top-line is likely to gain from the launch of its multi-stack, multi-protocol chip with the HUMAX Chorus Voice Assistant. This will help it advance in the IoT and enable integration of voice assistants in a smart home system.Moreover, IDP is anticipated to benefit from increasing adoption of its solutions in electronic warfare and missile defense. The company’s GaN products and the Spatium high-power amplifier family continues to gain good traction, which bodes well for top-line growth.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for IDP is currently pegged at $203 million.What Our Model SaysAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.

985,QRVO,"The technology sector has lately been spooked by a spate of negative news from some of its key companies. Among the worst hit were FANG stocks as Facebook’s (FB  -  Free Report) data scandal raised concerns over stringent regulations for the social media space, and a series of allegations from Donald Trump via Twitter on its business practices spurred Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) sell-off.The attack from industry players like chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM  -  Free Report) and semiconductor-equipment supplier Lam Research (LRCX  -  Free Report) added to the latest chaos. Taiwan Semiconductor warned of waning mobile demand for the second quarter and thus reduced its sales growth target for this year to 5% from its prior outlook of 5-7% growth while Lam Research offered a disappointing outlook for chip-gear shipments for the rest of the year.Notably, TSM is Apple's (AAPL  -  Free Report) biggest supplier and the negative news has taken a toll on shares of the technology giant. Apple shed $60 billion in two days following the news. Several global chipmakers also lost market value, including Analog Devices (ADI  -  Free Report), Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report) and Qorvo (QRVO  -  Free Report).While a number of these headwinds have spread negative sentiments in the space, the rapid adoption of cutting-edge technology and solid corporate earnings are expected to fuel growth. In particular, Q1 earnings from 29.9% of the sector’s total market capitalization reported so far are up 36.3% on 13.7% higher revenues, with 100% of the companies beating on earnings and 85.7% exceeding top-line estimates. Overall, earnings and revenues for Q1 are expected to grow 22.6% and 11.9%, respectively.Given the optimism, a number of stocks in the sector have seen their Rank surging to the top-most rung in a couple of days. These are also backed by strong fundamentals compared to many others. Any of these could be a compelling choice to beat the ongoing tech turmoil and make for great picks this earnings season.

986,QRVO,"Relying on a handful of customers poses a great risk to the sustainability of one’s business. Currently, the perfect example of this is companies including, Cirrus Logic, Inc. (CRUS  -  Free Report), Qorvo, Inc. (QRVO  -  Free Report) and Infineon Technologies AG (IFNNY  -  Free Report), all of which have been affected by a high customer concentration.It should be noted that Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) is the largest customer of the aforementioned companies, and the firm’s sales of iPhones have been below expectations, particularly the latest one — iPhone X. Owing to the troubles, this January Apple slashed its production target by half from almost 40 million projected during the iPhone X release, per Nikkei.Moreover, Apple reported a dismal iPhone unit sales performance in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 thanks to the lower-than-expected holiday season sales of its premium device iPhone X.  For the quarter ending Dec 31, 2017, iPhone unit sales edged down 1% year over year.Goldman Sachs’ latest prediction on iPhone sales has put further shadow on the growth prospects of Apple’s component suppliers. The investment firm, in its Mar 27 note, announced trimming iPhone sales expectations by a whopping 1.7 million units to 53 million, for the March quarter. Also, for the quarter ending June, the firm forecasts sales of 40.3 million units, a decline of 3.2 million from the previous projection.Lesser production implies lesser component requirement, which, in turn, will have a substantial impact on suppliers.Let’s see how the lackluster iPhone sales performance has hit the above-mentioned three major iPhone component suppliers.Cirrus Logic is the worst affected company. The company generates more than 75% of its revenues by selling audio chips which are used in iPhone devices. During the last reported quarter, the company witnessed a 7.7% decline in revenues mainly due to the sudden fall in demand for smartphones in the later part of December 2017. Cirrus Logic provided a tepid outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 too. This Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock has depreciated 25.7% in the year so far.Qorvo — a provider of radio frequency chips to Apple — also falls in the same category. Apple accounted for 34% of the company’s total revenues in fiscal 2017. Although the company’s last-quarter revenues were slightly affected, a disappointing revenue outlook for fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 indicates that it will be hit significantly by the iPhone X production cut. In the last month, shares of this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company have slipped 19.3%. The third major component supplier likely to be affected by sluggish iPhone sales is Infineon Technologies. The company furnishes cellular basebands for Apple which forms the core chipsets used in iPhones. During the last-quarter earnings conference call, the company lowered its fiscal 2018 revenue outlook and provided a disappointing sales guidance for the fiscal second quarter. The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has lost 10.9% in a month’s time.

987,QRVO,"Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) is no doubt a valued customer to have but its recent actions are increasingly speaking otherwise.The recent revelation per a Bloomberg report that Apple will utilize its own chips phasing out Intel’s chips in Mac by 2020 has sent ripples across its supplier base.We believe Apple’s focus on building a closed ecosystem of semiconductor solutions for its own usage will hurt suppliers like Infineon Technologies (IFNNY  -  Free Report), Cirrus Logic (CRUS  -  Free Report) and Qorvo Inc (QRVO  -  Free Report).Apple to Gain From Vertical IntegrationApple’s decision to use its own processors in Mac is expected to improve margins. Becoming self reliant will also reduce the company’s dependence on its suppliers, consequently improving time to market.Apple Inc. Price and Consensus Apple Inc. Price and Consensus | Apple Inc. QuoteApple already develops co-processors for Mac that manage hardware's camera, OLED Touch Bar, boot process and fingerprint sensor.Moreover, the company uses its in-house developed display timing controller chips, fingerprint sensors, Bluetooth audio processors, flash memory controllers and mobile SoCs.Apple Policy to Hurt SuppliersHowever, Apple’s aggressive vertical integration policy is a significant headwind for its suppliers.Last year the company had announced that it will do away with graphics chip of Imagination Technologies, a British company by 2019 for its own.Moreover, the U.K.-based chip company, Dialog Semiconductor which supplied Apple its power management chip for iPhone shared the same fate, last year. The company used to generate almost 74% of its revenues from Apple.Few weeks back, a Bloomberg report revealed that Apple is developing MicroLED screens in its own facilities in California and Taiwan. The move had hurt its display and related component suppliers namely Samsung, Sharp, LG Display, Corning and Japan Display.Currently, Apple carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.3 Suppliers At RiskInvestors remain more sceptical of the suppliers which depend on the iPhone maker for a significant portion of their total revenues. So, if Apple further strengthens its in-house model, tides might turn against these three suppliers.Infineon furnishes cellular basebands to Apple which forms the core chipsets that are used in iPhones. Requirement of large capital investments in order to maintain a competitive cost position remains a woe for this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock.Infineon Technologies AG Price and Consensus Infineon Technologies AG Price and Consensus | Infineon Technologies AG QuoteCirrus is another such stock. The company generates majority its revenues through selling audio amplifier chips used in iPhone devices. Dismal sales of iPhone X and Apple’s recent decision to cut down productions of the device is likely to impede this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock’s near-term results.Cirrus Logic, Inc. Price and Consensus Cirrus Logic, Inc. Price and Consensus | Cirrus Logic, Inc. QuoteQorvo, a provider of radio frequency chips to Apple, also falls in the same category. Apple accounted for 34% of company’s total revenues in fiscal 2017. Moreover, intensifying competition creating low barriers to entry have plagued this Zacks Rank #4 stock.Qorvo, Inc.

988,QRVO,"Qorvo, Inc. (QRVO  -  Free Report) recently announced its intent to initiate a workforce downsizing with a view to improve its cost structure. Triad Business Journal quoted Qorvo representative, Brent Dietz, who stated that the company’s Greensboro operations will be impacted by this decision. However, the extent of the impact has not yet been specified.Additionally, Qorvo also mentioned that as a step toward expanding its presence in the defense market, the company has partnered with Veterans Trading Company (VTC), an end-to-end supply chain service provider that serves the government contract community.Management expects this channel partnership to optimize efficiency of operations related to Qorvo’s government customers.Notably, the almost concurrent announcements of downsizing and expanding via partnership reflect the company’s strategic initiatives toward improving overall growth. We believe these steps will definitely provide the company’s shares a considerable momentum in the near term.Shares of Qorvo have gained 41% on a year-to-date basis, outperforming the industry’s rally of 38.3%.Infrastructure and Defense - A Key CatalystInfrastructure and Defense (IDP) is a key catalyst for Qorvo. Segment revenues grew 22% year over year to $184 million in the last quarter, driven by improving demand from high-growth markets. The company noted that customer demand for high-powered Bulk Acoustic Wave (BAW) for the 3.5 gigahertz band for 5G massive Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) antennas remained strong in the reported quarter.The defense business was strong in the quarter as reflected in the 25% surge in GaN and BAW revenues. Multiyear defense contracts supporting programs like F-15, 16 and F-35 also aided growth. Revenues from the largest defense customer more than doubled on a year-over-year basis. In such a scenario, the partnership with VTC seems to be perfectly timed and is anticipated to boost revenue generation from the defense segment going ahead.Qorvo, Inc. Revenue (TTM) Qorvo, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Qorvo, Inc. QuoteTo ConcludeWe believe that, Qorvo’s downsizing strategy after two years of declaring that its hiring expectations as part of a $25 million expansion in Greensboro were exceeded, is a prudent initiative that will boost shareholder value.Moreover, the company is expected to benefit from modest improvements in China, with continued strength in IDP.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderQorvo has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Stocks that can be considered in the broader technology space are Applied Materials, Inc.

994,QRVO,"Qorvo ((QRVO  -  Free Report)) is a specialty maker of RF (radio frequency) semiconductors for mobile smartphones and the ubiquitous ""Internet of Things"" (IOT), which comprises devices from key fobs to jewelry for Internet-connected security and payments across millions of companies and billions of transactions annually and rising.  But the company stock has seen a steep slide in earnings estimates this year that does not appear to stopping any time soon. Part of the malaise for Qorvo is its revenue leverage to key customer Apple (AAPL) who has been seeking lately to become more self-reliant in the design and manufacture of its semiconductors components. Downward Estimate Revisions Analysts have become increasingly bearish on the stock in the past couple of months with all estimates moving south and no movement in the opposite direction for the ongoing quarter. Moreover, the company’s first quarter of fiscal 2019 earnings estimates (the current June quarter) moved down from 80 cents to 76 cents in the past 30 days. Further, in the same time period, the company’s fiscal 2019 earnings estimates moved down from $5.97 to $5.92. And estimates had already been on a downward trajectory in previous months as the current fiscal year started out at an EPS consensus of $6.31. Low Returns Across the Matrix Given the other unattractive attributes like low return on equity (ROE), low return on capital (ROC) and low return on assets (ROA), makes the stock look very unappealing. Qorvo currently trades at a ROE of 13.8%, much lower than the industry’s average of 22.8%. Notably, the company has an ROC and ROA of 10.3% and 10.4% compared with the industry’s average of 20.8% and 18.5%, respectively. The good news for Qorvo is that next fiscal year EPS estimates have actually risen from $6.87 to $6.95, granting the forward valuation an attractive sub-12X multiple. Dependence on iPhone Sales Qorvo depends on a handful of customers including Apple and Huawei to keep its revenues churning. To add to the woes, Apple’s self reliance strategy is a looming threat. Moreover, the company operates in a competitive landscape that is becoming more complex with low barriers to entry for RF chip technology. The increased competition is exerting pricing pressure, which remains a matter of concern for the company. In order to sustain its market position, Qorvo has to constantly come up with new products. Consequently, higher spending on product development is likely to keep margins under pressure at least in the near term. Hence, we recommend investors to be wary of Qorvo shares until its Zacks Rank and estimates improve. Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside? Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana. Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

995,QRVO,"In case you are still holding on to shares of Qorvo, Inc. (QRVO  -  Free Report) in your portfolio, it’s high time to get rid of the stock. The odds in favor of an upside in the near term are slim. The company has been witnessing downward revisions and has weak fundamentals.

Notably, the company has an ROC and ROA of 10.3% and 10.4% compared with the industry’s average of 20.8% and 18.5%, respectively.ValuationWe note that the Qorvo currently has a trailing 12-month P/E ratio of 18.53. This level compares unfavorably with what the industry has witnessed over the last year. The ratio is higher than the average level of 17.86 and is toward its higher end of the valuation range over this period. Consequently, valuation looks slightly stretched from a P/E perspective.Dependence on iPhone SalesQorvo depends on a handful of customers including Apple and Huawei to keep its revenues churning. To add to the woes, Apple’s self reliance strategy is a looming threat. Moreover, the company operates in a competitive landscape that is becoming more complex with low barriers to entry. The increased competition is exerting pricing pressure, which remains a matter of concern for the company.Qorvo’s top-line growth is significantly dependent on iPhone’s growth trajectory.

997,QRVO,"Apple’s (AAPL  -  Free Report) strategy of becoming self-reliant has had a detrimental effect on suppliers like Dialog Semiconductor (DLGNF  -  Free Report). The iPhone-maker recently lowered its order for power-management chips (PMICs), of which Dialog is the primary supplier, by almost 30%.Apple’s decision to multi-source PMIC chips for one of its three new iPhone models, set to release in 2018, is expected to hurt Dialog’s top-line by 5%. However, Dialog still expects to report year-over-year growth in 2018.Notably, Apple contributed 77% of Dialog’s total revenues in 2017.Apple’s In-house Strategy Hurts Most SuppliersApple’s focus on building a closed ecosystem of semiconductor solutions is likely to affect suppliers like Dialog, Cirrus Logic (CRUS  -  Free Report) and Qorvo (QRVO  -  Free Report). Apple Inc.

This futuristic — gallium nitride on silicon carbide (GaN-on-SiC) RF transistor — is likely to find significant application in defense and avionics.QPD1025 features remarkable 15% drain efficiency improvement over LDMOS. It enhances duty cycle performance and pulsed power of silicon bipolar and silicon LDMOS devices. The high power density product renders the practice of combining amplifiers redundant. The innovative transistor excludes diamond integration for thermal management, making it economical as well.The aforementioned features combined with reduced size, extended gain and reach, and exceptional signal integrity makes the solution an ideal choice for ‘‘L-band avionics and Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) applications.”Upbeat Q3, IDP Outlook PositiveThe company’s shares have returned 20.5% year over year, outperforming the 10.6% rally of the industry. The growth can be attributed to strong top-line growth driven by a robust portfolio.In third-quarter fiscal 2018 revenues on a non-GAAP basis increased 2.4% year over year to $844.8 million. The company’s Infrastructure and Defense (“IDP”) segment reported revenues of $203 million which grew 20% year over year. Growth can be attributed to strong demand for the company’s solutions in defense (advanced radars and other electronic warfare products), surge in GaN revenues and connectivity (Wi-Fi and emerging IoT applications).For fiscal year 2019, the company projects robust IDP growth, driven by higher trends in defense IoT and GaN.What Investors Need To Know?Specifically catering to RF GaN market for 2016-2021 time frame, The Strategy Analytics Strategic Component Applications (SCA) group estimates the revenue to reach $733 million in 2021 implying a CAAGR (compound annual average growth rate) of 14.1%.Per a MarketsandMarkets report, the GaN power device market is projected to grow at CAGR of 29.1% to reach $1.89 billion by 2023.

1000,QRVO,"The year 2018 has started off with the rumor mills churning out news about major mergers and acquisitions. Intel Corp. (INTC  -  Free Report) is now rumored to show interest in Broadcom (AVGO  -  Free Report). Post President Donald Trump’s intervention into Broadcom-Qualcomm deal, chances of a possible merger has brightened up between the two big chip-makers.Intel Corporation Price Intel Corporation Price | Intel Corporation QuoteIntel carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Rationale Behind the Rumored DealBroadcom has been hogging the headlines of late with its hostile bid for Qualcomm. However, the deal has finally come to a conclusion, with President Trump prohibiting the proposed takeover on grounds of national security concerns. The rejection stems from Trump’s concern of conceding China the upper hand in 5G communications technology.Intel was skeptical that a Broadcom-Qualcomm combination could have posed serious competitive threats to its growing data centric business. Reportedly, the second-largest chipmaker had been planning to launch a bid for Broadcom since last year, which, however it postponed due to the ongoing Brocade integration.Further, Intel took a wait & watch policy after Broadcom announced the hostile bid for Qualcomm. We believe that Broadcom’s failed attempt to buy Qualcomm can now encourage Intel to make a bid as the acquisition willprovide its significant competitive advantage in the chip market.Further, a significant portion of Broadcom’s revenues come from Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), which contributed more than 10% of revenues in fiscal 2017. Hence, grabbing Broadcom will improve Intel’s foothold into Apple’s supplier chain.We believe that this can be a major incentive for Intel to bid for Broadcom’s assets, which will improve its position in the mobile communications market.3 Technology Stocks at Risk The possibility of Intel acquiring Broadcomhas raised concerns among the chipmakers namely Skyworks Solutions (SWKS  -  Free Report), Qorvo (QRVO  -  Free Report) and Micron Technology (MU  -  Free Report).Let’s dig into the details on how these semiconductor companies will be hurt by Intel-Broadcom deal:Firstly, Skyworks Solutions, a designer as well as a manufacturer of high performance analog and mixed signal semiconductors,stands to get hurt from Intel-Broadcom deal. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock is significantly dependent on Apple, which accounts for about 40% of Skyworks’ revenues.Skyworks Solutions, Inc. Price Skyworks Solutions, Inc. Price | Skyworks Solutions, Inc. QuoteSkyworks has won contracts in recent times from multiple Tier 1 original equipment manufacturers (OEM) including Apple. The company’s growing presence into Internet of Things (IoT), connected cars, and 5G are significant growth drivers.However, Intel-Broadcom deal can put this ambition into jeopardy. The sheer size of the combined entity will put significant pricing pressure on Skyworks leading to declining margin profile.Secondly, let’s gauge the impact of this possible deal on Qorvo. This Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) companyis a leading provider of core technologies and radio frequency (RF) solutions for mobile, infrastructure and aerospace/defense applications. A significant portion of Qorvo’s revenues come from a handful of customers including Apple and Huawei, which contributed 34% and 11% of its revenues, respectively, in fiscal 2017.Qorvo, Inc. Price Qorvo, Inc. Price | Qorvo, Inc. QuoteQorvo’s BAW filters, antenna tuners, RF front end modules and envelope tracking power management solution were used in Huawei’s flagship Mate 10 device. Moreover, the company tested the industry’s first RF front end module addressing 5G standalone and 5G non-standalone requirements.During the quarter,  Qorvo was selected as a provider of front-end power amplifiers (PA) to Qualcomm for its Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) Reference Design. This will help the company penetrate deeper into the automotive industry.However, Broadcom’s Wireless Communications segment serves the smartphone market with similar products that include a broad variety of RF semiconductor devices, connectivity solutions and custom touch controllers is the closest competitor to Qorvo.Hence, it’s obvious that if Intel acquires Broadcom, it will intensify the competition for Qorvo.Lastly, Micron remains one of the outstanding performers in the semiconductor space. Notably, this Zacks Rank #2 is witnessing improved pricing as well as elevated demand for DRAM and NAND chips. Mobile Business Unit (“MBU”) which includes Micron’s DRAM, NAND Flash, and NOR Flash products that are sold to smartphone, feature phone, and tablet mobile-device manufacturers accounted for 22% of fiscal 2017 revenues. Moreover, Micron recently added Apple to its customer roster.Micron Technology, Inc. Price Micron Technology, Inc. Price | Micron Technology, Inc. QuoteIf Intel buys Broadcom the combined strength will pose significant threat to Micron's position in the Flash-based products market. Further, the combination can help Intel grab share from the company in Apple’s supply chain base.Bottom LineWhile Apple stands to gain from the deal, Skyworks, Qorvoand Micron could lose out if it goes through. This explains their opposing stands on the issue even as the fate of this rumored deal hangs in the balance.Breaking News: Cryptocurrencies Now Bigger than VisaThe total market cap of all cryptos recently surpassed $700 billion – more than a 3,800% increase in the previous 12 months.

1003,QRVO,"Qorvo Inc (QRVO  -  Free Report) is set to release third-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings on Jan 31.Notably, the company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters with an average positive surprise of 6.16%. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive surprise of 5.56%.For the third quarter of fiscal 2018, gross margin is anticipated to be almost 47.5%, almost flat sequentially, primarily due to unfavorable product mix. Operating expenses are forecast to remain flat at approximately $158 million for the third quarter. The guidance reflects strength at customers' flagship models and continued strength in IDP.Management expects non-GAAP revenues to be approximately $830-$850 million. Earnings are anticipated to be $1.60 at the midpoint of the guidance.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is currently pegged at $1.60 on revenues of $841 million.Notably, the stock has returned 5.7% in the past year, substantially outperforming the 1.2% gain of the industry. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Improving Demand in China to Boost Top LineNotably, China accounts for almost 30% of Qorvo’s Mobile Product revenues. Per market research firm GFK, smartphone demand in China decreased 3% in fourth-quarter 2017, while average selling price (ASP) jumped 17% year over year. The improving price environment bodes well for Qorvo’s top line. However, the product mix will continue to be a drag as consumers are favoring lower content phones, as witnessed so far in the cycle.Qorvo’s results significantly depend on the performance of Apple Inc’s (AAPL  -  Free Report) iPhone. We believe that higher dollar content iPhone X will drive top line growth. Additionally, improving market share at Samsung and Huawei is a positive.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Mobile Products is currently pegged at $642 million.Key FactorsWe believe IDP will be the key growth driver for Qorvo in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. The company is benefiting from strong demand for its high-powered Bulk Acoustic Wave (BAW) for the 3.5 gigahertz band for 5G massive Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) antennas.The defense business was strong in the last quarter as reflected in the 25% surge in GaN and BAW revenues. Multiyear defense contracts supporting programs like F-15, 16 and F-35 also aided growth.Management expects double-digit year-over-year growth in IDP, given its broad customer base in smart home IoT, base station, Wi-Fi and optical.We expect the company’s top line to benefit from the launch of its multi-stack, multi-protocol chip in the HUMAX voice assistant. This will help the company advance in the Internet of Things (IoT) and enable integration of voice assistants in a smart home system. Per market research firm Gartner, global spending on Voice assistants is forecast to reach a level of $3.52 billion by 2021.During the quarter, Qorvo was selected as a provider of front-end power amplifiers (PA) to Qualcomm for its Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) Reference Design. This will help the company to penetrate deeper into the automotive industry, driving top-line growth.Moreover, the company is working toward a connected ecosystem of devices as evident through its expansion of distributed Wi-fi mesh solutions for homes. The company is witnessing increased demand for these Wi-fi mesh solutions owing to wider frequency coverage and reduced power consumption.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for IDP is currently pegged at $197 million.Unfavorable Rank, Negative ESPWe believe that Qorvo is unlikely to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the third quarter due to an unfavorable combination of Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) and an Earnings ESP of -0.19%.

1005,QRVO,"On Dec 13, Qorvo Inc. (QRVO  -  Free Report) was downgraded to a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Why the Downgrade?The downgrade can primarily be attributed to Qorvo’s unimpressive revenue guidance for the next two quarters.Management cited delayed product cycle at its largest customer to be one of the major reasons that will hurt Mobile Products (MP) revenues in the current quarter. Moreover, fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 revenues are projected to decline sequentially.Additionally, Qorvo anticipates gross margin to be flat sequentially in the current quarter, primarily due to unfavorable product mix.  Qorvo’s stock has gained 28.4% year to date, slightly outperforming the 23.7% rally of its industry. Mix Improvement Not ImminentWe note that consumer preference for mid-tier phones, which have lower dollar content, in India and China are affecting Qorvo’s growth trajectory. Management doesn’t expect 50% gross margin, while exiting fiscal 2018, primarily due to the aforementioned reason.However, Qorvo anticipates gross margin expansion to restart in fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 and continue throughout the next fiscal driven by improving mix, ongoing productivity efforts and increasing fab utilization.Qorvo expects revenues to decline less than seasonally over the December-March time frame. In the second half, management expects double-digit year-over-year growth, with gains on new mobile platforms and continued strong IDP growth.Operating expenses in dollar terms are also expected to decline from fiscal 2017 level.Estimates Remain SteadyThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019 has been steady at $5.47 and $6.43, respectively.Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is currently pegged at $3.10 billion for fiscal 2018 and $3.37 billion for fiscal 2019.Other Stocks to Consider Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report), NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) and Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report) are stocks worth considering in the broader technology sector.
