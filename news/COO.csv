0,COO,"Cooper Companies (COO) saw its IBD SmartSelect Composite Rating rise to 97 Monday, up from 90 the day before. X The upgrade means the stock is now outpacing 97% of all other stocks in terms of key performance metrics and technical strength. History shows the top market performers tend to have a 95 or higher score as they launch their major climbs. Cooper Companies broke out earlier, but has fallen back below the prior 254.58 entry from a flat base. In the case where a stock breaks out then falls 7% or more below the entry price, it's considered a failed breakout. If that happens, it's best to wait for a new base to form. See How IBD Helps You Make More Money In StocksThe stock has a 93 EPS Rating, meaning its recent quarterly and annual earnings growth tops 93% of all stocks. Its Accumulation/Distribution Rating of B shows moderate buying by institutional investors over the last 13 weeks. In Q1, the company posted 45% EPS growth. It has now posted accelerating EPS gains for two consecutive quarters. Sales growth increased 18%, up from 8% in the prior report. That marks one quarter of rising revenue increases.

1,COO,"Stock market futures rose modestly early Friday, with Dow Jones futures, S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures all higher.Applied Materials (AMAT) was a big loser on disappointing sales guidance late Thursday. Fellow chip-equipment makers such as Lam Research (LRCX) and KLA-Tencor (KLAC) also retreated. So did memory chip giant Micron Technology (MU).Meanwhile, China search engine giant Baidu (BIDU) fell sharply after announcing a key executive shakeup involving its artificial intelligence efforts.As for stock market futures today, Dow Jones futures rose 0.25% vs. fair value. S&P 500 futures climbed 0.1%. Nasdaq 100 futures advanced nearly 0.2%.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseIn Thursday's stock market trading, the Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite closed with slim losses. Small caps continued to lead, with the S&P 600 rising for the ninth time in 10 sessions.Baidu says that COO Lu Qi will leave the role and no longer oversee the search engine giant's artificial intelligence efforts. Qi had joined the company in late 2016 to head up AI efforts. Baidu has made huge spending bets on AI to drive future growth.The stock fell 6.2% to 262.50 in premarket trading. That would push Baidu back below a conventional entry of 275.07 from a long consolidation.Applied Materials earnings rose 54% to $1.22 a share in its fiscal Q2, with revenue rising 29% to $4.57 billion. Both comfortably beat analyst views. But the chip-equipment maker sees Q3 revenue of $4.43 billion. That's roughly in line with the Zacks estimate of $4.45 billion, but clearly below other consensus targets for $4.53 billion.Applied Materials fell 5.1% in the premarket, suggesting a move below its 200-day moving average at Friday's open. On Thursday, the stock fell 2.2% to 53.96, once again hitting resistance at its 50-day moving average.The Applied Materials stock chart, which previously had been forming a double-bottom base, is starting to look like a bearish head-and-shoulders pattern.Meanwhile, Lam Research lost about 1.5% early Friday. KLA-Tencor was not yet active Friday but had fallen late Thursday by about 1.5%. Lam has been fighting to hold above its 50-day, while KLA-Tencor is just above that level.Applied Materials is heavily exposed to the memory market, with over half its sales going to the DRAM and flash markets. Memory giant Micron Technology lost 0.6% early Friday. Micron fell 3.2% to 54.70 on Thursday. The IBD 50 chip stock has been building the right side of a consolidation, retaking its 50-day line on Monday.The broader chip sector has been so-so in recent months. Chipmakers and fabless chipmakers have done reasonably well, helped by Intel (INTC) and Nvidia (NVDA) moving into buy range. A few others are consolidating in decent form, but breakouts are scarce. But chip-equipment makers have struggled in recent months, with the Electronics-Semiconductor Equipment group falling to 133 out of the 197 industries tracked by IBD. The group's relative strength line has been lagging for nearly six months, reflecting its underperformance vs. the S&P 500 index.Typically, the broader stock market struggles to rally without chips. The major averages have largely done so in recent weeks in part due to the surge in oil stocks. But it's also due to Apple (AAPL), which is a huge buyer of chips. But Apple's big recent breakout reflects optimism about a $100 billion buyback, strong growth in services and Warren Buffett buying more shares. None of that benefits chipmakers. Indeed, iPhone shipments were slightly below estimates in the latest quarter.But with Apple now pausing after its 17% surge over nine sessions, watch to see if the relationship between chips and the broader market reasserts itself.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:The Big Picture: Small Caps Sail As Rest Of Market HesitatesBest Oil Stocks: Callon Petroleum Grows Like Gangbusters In Permian BasinThe Stock Market Myth That Too Many BelieveTop IPO Stock Triggers Sell Signal, But Rebounds; Is It Safe To Buy?Deere Reports, These 2 IBD 50 Stocks Form Bases: Investing Action Plan

3,COO,"WASHINGTON — SpaceX expects to launch its biggest rocket yet, the Big Falcon Rocket, into orbit in 2020, ahead of a planned mission to Mars a few years later.X The BFR will be ""orbital in 2020 or so"" but ""we'll see short hops next year,"" SpaceX Chief Operating Officer Gwynne Shotwell said during a panel late Monday at the Satellite 2018 convention.Her comments on initial BFR flights next year were notable as they reiterated SpaceX and Tesla (TSLA) founder Elon Musk's bold claim at SXSW Sunday that the BFR will conduct ""short up and down flights, during the first half of next year.""While Musk is notorious for being overly optimistic about timelines, and even acknowledged that on Sunday, Shotwell backed him up a day later.Musk said the launch of SpaceX's Falcon Heavy last month gave him ""confidence BFR is really quite workable."" And by 2022, he said SpaceX plans to send a cargo mission to Mars with crewed missions eventually following.SpaceX is in full throttle development mode for the BFR, with all engineering resources focused on the BFR, and no major design updates are planned for the Falcon 9 or Falcon Heavy.Shotwell also said Monday that customers have warmed to the idea of reusable boosters quicker than she expected and that half of the SpaceX's 31 launches this year will be on previously used boosters.Reusability has been a driving force in keeping launch costs down and increasing the number of launches per year, allowing SpaceX to step up planned launches this year by about 50% from last year.Shotwell added that after demonstrating reusable boosters, it's ""soul-crushing"" to throw away payload fairings, the nose cone of rockets. SpaceX would eventually like the to reuse the fairing. After the Falcon Heavy's maiden flight in February, Musk tweeted that the rocket's fairing missed the ship by a few hundred meters but landed intact on the water.Sign Up For Free IBD Newsletters: Market Prep | Tech ReportWhile SpaceX has been reusing lower-stage boosters, Tory Bruno, CEO of United Launch Alliance, a Boeing (BA)- Lockheed Martin (LMT) joint venture, said he was looking at upper stage reusability with the company's Advanced Cryogenic Evolved Stage (ACES).The ACES upper stage would use liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen for ULA's upcoming Vulcan launch vehicle.ACES ""is in our mind is going to be a revolution that will allow the creation of whole new missions in Earth orbit and a transportation system in space,"" Bruno said Monday. ""I believe it will revolutionize what we do in space in a way that economic advantages in lift from earth's surface can never do.""ACES is scheduled to debut in 2023.ULA also expects to decide ""soon"" on a supplier for the first-stage engine for the Vulcan, and options include one from Amazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin and Aerojet Rocketdyne (AJRD).Lockheed shares were up 0.1% on the stock market today.

4,COO,"Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts once wrote that the ""way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race."" He wrote those words in a 2007 opinion that turned back Seattle's race-based efforts to implement affirmative action-type policies to its local school district. While that case garnered a race-neutral result, his broader message seems to have fallen on deaf ears.In America, race-based policies are expanding not contracting.Rather than reaching down to lower-level schools, affirmative action policies are now exponentially expanding into corporate America.In recent weeks, Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Facebook (FB) have announced updated diversity policies for selecting new directors. Rather than simply selecting the best candidate, each company will interview a female and an under-represented minority for each open board spot. These policies resemble the National Football League's so-called Rooney Rule which requires that each team interview a minority candidate for open coaching slots.Amazon, Facebook, and Alphabet were founded by, and still run by, white men. They have created tremendous wealth and many millions of jobs for women and men of all races and ethnicities. But in light of its new procedure, it's fair to ask: would Amazon reject Jeff Bezos from its board because he's a white male? That would be a disaster for Amazon's investors.It's also fair to ask if the race-hustlers and far-left unions that are pushing these racial and gender diversity initiatives care about corporate profits or return on investment. Liberal policies that their ilk promote, such as high taxation and regulation, diminish corporate profits.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAlphabet announced its new procedure at its annual shareholder meeting a week after Facebook and Amazon did the same. Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg proudly publicized its new policy after a question from Jesse Jackson in which he attacked the company because its ""top 15 employees are white."" Jackson lauded Sandberg's proclamation in which she also revealed that Facebook formulated the new board principles in conjunction with the Service Employees International Union (SEIU).Likewise, Amazon's announcement came in response to an SEIU shareholder proposal pushing board diversity. Jackson was also in attendance to laud that racial initiative. Amazon has since claimed that it's not a new policy but just an affirmation of its practices already in place.There is reason to doubt Amazon's veracity.Companies may ask the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for permission to exclude any shareholder proposal from their proxy statement. One of the easiest ways to do so is to show that the company already has practices in place that align with the proposal's request. If Amazon is telling the truth now, why didn't it make this basic appeal to the SEC?Amazon certainly avails itself of this option. In 2018, it petitioned the SEC for the right to remove nine proposals from its proxy statement — far more than most corporations do in a given year. Many of these requests involved more complex SEC provisions and legal reasoning than would have been needed to dispatch the SEIU's proposal, that is, if Amazon is telling the truth.What is true is that once the SEIU's proposal was on Amazon's proxy statement, it received support from Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS).ISS is one of only two major proxy advisory services. Operating with almost zero scrutiny, these firms increasingly exert outsized influence on environmental, governmental, and social issues. That's because, according to research from the American Council for Capital Formation, ""when proxy advisors recommend voting in favor of a proposal, large institutional holders support the resolution 80% of the time. And some funds automatically vote with the proxy advisors nearly 100% of the time.""ISS has become little more than a rubber stamp for liberal activist investors. From climate change to gender pay issues, to board racial and gender composition, ISS supports a full slate of far-left shareholder proposals.It's entirely possible that Amazon caved to the SEIU's proposal under pressure from ISS. If ISS can exert that much power over Bezos and Amazon — the richest person in the world and one of the world's largest publicly-traded companies — what choice do other companies have but to bend to ISS's liberal will?The outsized role of proxy advisors has received congressional attention. A bipartisan bill working its way through the House, co-sponsored by Congressmen Sean Duffy, R-Wisc., and Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y., seeks to curb these firms' unchecked power.There are also non-governmental remedies.First, companies need to steel their collective spines and speak up. If ISS supports a shareholder proposal, the vote is essentially rigged. ISS clients often ""rubber stamp"" votes for its recommendations without any deliberative process. Since shareholder resolutions are non-binding, and these votes are all-but rigged, companies should give them little deference.Second, fund managers must take a more active role in evaluating ISS recommendations.Finally, the conservative investment community should work toward creating a proxy advisory service that reflects pro-growth and long-term return on investment metrics.Otherwise, conservatives may as well cede this entire space to liberal firms and watch corporate America drift further to the left. This year, with ISS backing, it's the Rooney Rule run amok. Next year, it may be something even more insidious.Is Trump's Protectionism The Death Knell For Global Free Trade?Turns Out, Those Forced Union Dues Did Go To Liberal Advocacy GroupsThanks To Tax Cuts, Companies' Overseas Profits Now Flooding Back To U.S.

6,COO,"Another chief executive fell victim to the slump in the U.S. packaged-food industry.Campbell Soup (CPB) CEO Denise Morrison, 64, abruptly stepped down Friday after a lackluster seven-year tenure at the helm of the company. She tried — and never managed — to move beyond canned soup to ignite sales growth as Americans change how they eat and shop. The shares plunged the most in almost two decades.""They've had a rough go of it,"" said Michael Halen, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. ""The move into the fresh business has been problematic — they've had a lot of things that didn't work.""Morrison will be replaced on an interim basis by Keith McLoughlin, a 61-year-old former CEO at Electrolux who has been a board member since 2016, Campbell said. The Camden, New Jersey-based company didn't say who will permanently succeed her, but last month promoted industry veteran Luca Mignini to chief operations officer.Whoever replaces Morrison will face the same challenges that have claimed the leaders of other Big Food companies like Kellogg (K) and Mondelez International (MDLZ). The stock, down 38% in the past two years, plunged an additional 11% to 34.94 on Friday as Campbell also gave a bleak full-year forecast. Campbell is suffering its biggest intraday loss since January 1999.Morrison, who has been with Campbell for 15 years, took over in 2011 and less than a year later Campbell agreed to buy Bolthouse Farms, a maker of fresh juice and salad dressing that also operated a carrot-farming business. The deal was seen as a way to push the canned soup company into fresher and more natural products, which are on trend with modern consumers. But the merger has been hampered by operational issues and a recall that battered results. Campbell has since been mired in a three-year sales slump.The stock said it will start a strategic review of its businesses, which will ""take several months to complete."" It plans to update investors on the outcome when it reports fourth-quarter results in late August.Campbell has been seeking other sources of growth as it grapples with the soup slowdown. In December, the company agreed to buy Snyder's-Lance in a bid to push deeper into salty snacks — a bright spot in the struggling packaged-food industry. That deal gives Campbell, which makes Goldfish crackers, brands such as Cape Cod potato chips and Snyder's pretzels.The recently promoted COO, Mignini, 55, joined Campbell in 2013. He had been running the snacks unit, and is now overseeing Campbell's soup business in addition to managing the expanded portfolio of snacks.

Penney (JCP) face-planted, sorely disappointing on same-store sales growth and slashing full-year EPS guidance. Nordstrom delivered surprise earnings growth and lifted the bottom end of EPS guidance, but quarterly sales matched views and comps fell short.The home-improvement retailer beat first-quarter earnings estimates, but revenue and same-store sales came up short, as a cold spring season kept people from buying gardening and other outdoor supplies. Home Depot first held to its full-year financial outlook, citing ""a favorable housing and macroeconomic backdrop."" Online sales jumped, and rising prices of lumber, copper and other materials bumped up sales. Credit Suisse analysts also expected a rebound for Home Depot in the second quarter, but said ""we expect that the near-term direction of the stock to be dictated by weather in the coming weeks.""Retail sales data for April showed that the consumer soft patch to start the year has given way to strength, likely helped by delayed tax refunds. April data only matched expectations, rising 0.3% on the month, with the matching rise in sales excluding autos coming in below expectations. Yet the year-over-year retail sales gain accelerated to 4.7%, helped by an upward revision to March data. Some Wall Street economists responded by boosting second-quarter GDP estimates north of 3%.Meanwhile, the Philly Fed manufacturing index rose in May to just below cycle highs, with hiring strong. New orders and prices-received gauges hit multidecade highs.Shares in optical-component makers popped Monday after President Trump signaled in a tweet that he would reverse stiff sanctions on their key customer, Chinese telecom gear firm ZTE, as part of China trade talks. Acacia Communications (ACIA), NeoPhotonics (NPTN) and Lumentum Holdings (LITE) gave back some gains amid uncertainty over Trump's intent as well as whether talks with China are progressing. The ZTE sanctions, which barred U.S. companies from doing business with the Chinese giant, followed a probe into illegally shipped equipment to Iran and North Korea.The odds that Qualcomm (QCOM) will win China's approval for its planned takeover of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) improved significantly after Trump's conciliatory tweet on ZTE.Pressure on Tesla (TSLA) continued to mount as the maker of electric cars said it was temporarily halting work on its production line. Tesla reportedly will pause production at its California factory for six days to work on fixes to its assembly line for its troubled Model 3 automobile. Model 3 production is more than 2,000 cars a week, and Tesla intends to eventually ramp that up to 5,000. Goldman Sachs said cash-poor Tesla will need more than $10 billion in capital by 2020.Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) delivered a mixed March-quarter report, but Wall Street remained optimistic about the video game publisher's prospects, thanks to its upcoming Wild West action game ""Red Dead Redemption 2.""Children's Place (PLCE) stock gapped down after the kids apparel chain came in well short of earnings views Thursday. EPS fell 4% to $1.87 while revenue stayed almost even at $436 million.Western-work apparel retailer Boot Barn (BOOT) surged after coming in at par on earnings Wednesday. EPS jumped 42% to 17 cents per share. Revenue of $171 million was a beat.

11,COO,"""Everyone wants to change the world, but no one wants to change themselves,"" wrote Leo Tolstoy in ""War and Peace.""That's a favorite quote of John Knights, who along with Danielle Grant and Greg Young wrote ""Leading Beyond the Ego: How to Become a Transpersonal Leader.""Knights, also the co-founder and chairman of consulting firm LeaderShape, cites a study that suggests one in five CEOs have sociopathic tendencies, meaning someone who has no empathy and is interested only in themselves. While these leaders are often very persuasive, charismatic and good at getting to the top, ego run amok is often their Achilles heel.""Ego is that part of our self that is based on our self-image and only interested in our own personal benefit,"" Knights said. ""There is nothing immoral about having an ego, but we must learn to manage it.""Tips:Resist hardwiring. The human brain today is virtually the same one our Stone Age ancestors had, and is designed for survival and crisis, Knights says. This influences leadership in that ""the human default is to know everything and tell people what to do.""The reality, though, is that this kind of ""command and control leadership style is not effective in our modern, complex world where knowledge is no longer power,"" he said, ""because everyone can get it."" The problem lies in the fact that individuals ""are not very good at being told what to do. Our brain default to that is to switch off.""The solution lies in transpersonal leaders who ""operate beyond their ego, continuing personal development and learning,"" he said. ""They are radical, ethical and authentic while emotionally intelligent and caring.""Inventory core values. List your personal ones, and make sure being caring and ethical are on the list.Considering values to be ""your personal touchstone against which you check before making important decisions is a very valuable tool toward making your life more fulfilled and successful,"" Knights said.Corral hubris. Landing on the C-suite short list — meaning CEO, COO, CFO, etc. positions — requires the bold moves and uber-displays of competence that typify executive temperament, says Cassandra Frangos, author of ""Crack the C-Suite Code: How Successful Leaders Make It To The Top.""But avoid excessive pride and conceit. Once you're under imminent consideration for a C-suite position, it's important to demonstrate that your feet are planted firmly on the ground.""With emotional intelligence, persuasion and relatability becoming ever more important as leadership competencies, arrogance and the inability to admit when you are wrong is an immediate red flag during your climb to the top team,"" she says.Master adaptability. The idea of ""not knowing"" is a major theme across all paths to the C-suite, Frangos, a member of consulting firm Spencer Stuart's leadership advisory services team, has found.She says success in the C-suite means making decisions with limited information, adapting fast and coping with risk. ""When you can handle that trio of tough tasks, your mind will be primed for the ambiguity you will encounter as a part of the top team.""Test your beliefs. Legendary basketball coach John Wooden once said, ""It's what you learn after you know it all that counts.""People need to show that they have reinvented themselves numerous times over the course of their career and demonstrate ""the ability to unlearn the things that no longer apply,"" Frangos said. Further, the shape of the top team is morphing dramatically, she notes. New roles such as chief digital officer are trending, and the size of the top team is changing.Loners seldom reach the top. People who integrate multiple perspectives, ""as opposed to acting solely on their own beliefs,"" achieve more success, she says.""There are new core competencies for top executives,"" Frangos said. ""Sacrosanct concepts such as experience and tenure mean far less, and things such as followership, mindset and culture fit make all the difference in career success.""YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Adjust Your Perspective To Achieve GoalsAdvisors Help Clients Shift To New Goals

16,COO,"A struggle for power for the No. 2 spot of a potentially combined company is muddying up merger talks between CBS (CBS) and Viacom (VIAB), according to CNBC, citing sources.CBS COO Joe Ianniello and Viacom CEO Bob Bakish both want the job, says the outlet, which also reported sources saying that current CBS chief Les Moonves would be at the merged media company for at least two years.A special committee of five CBS board members formally submitted a below market-value bid for Viacom and called for CBS management, which would include Iannello, to lead the merged company, sources told Bloomberg.A final decision on the merger could be made as soon as this month, said the Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the matter.The outlet also said that 94-year-old Sumner Redstone, whose National Amusements controls about 80% of both CBS and Viacom, has only one vote on the board of the controlling company as his mental capacity comes under increasing scrutiny.National Amusements, which would have to sign off on any merger, reportedly has seven directors in total, including Sumner's daughter, Shari Redstone. She is said to be a driver behind current CBS-Viacom merger discussions.The elder Redstone is said to communicate via an iPad preloaded with recordings of his voice that are linked to ""yes,"" ""no"" and ""f*** you"" verbal commands, according to the Journal, citing people who have spoken with him.CBS shares finished 4.2% higher in the stock market today, while Viacom lost 3.7%.Fox News owner 21st Century Fox (FOXA) has floated a possible sale of Sky News to Walt Disney (DIS) as part of a set of remedies to U.K. regulators who seek to limit Rupert Murdoch's control of media in that market.Addressing concerns surrounding the editorial independence of Sky News, Fox offered new ring-fencing policies that would establish Sky News as a distinct company within parent Sky Group, equipping it with a Sky News-managed independent board and 15 years of guaranteed funding from Fox.The U.K. Competition and Markets Authority had provisionally found in January that the Fox-Sky deal was ""not in the public interest due to media plurality concerns,"" as it would give the Murdoch family ""too much control over news providers in the U.K. across all media platforms ... and therefore too much influence over public opinion and the political agenda.""As another option, Disney ""has expressed an interest in acquiring Sky News, with a view to adding it to Disney's existing portfolio of television channels, whether or not Disney's proposed acquisition of (21st Century Fox) proceeds,"" said Fox in a release.

Celgene, still reeling from the sudden departure of its chief operating officer, is typically weak in the first period.But clinical studies and business development are more important in biotech, he said.""We believe clinical trial successes and increased mergers-and-acquisitions activity will be more important to help improve sentiment given renewed drug pricing, competitive and life-cycle concerns across the sector,"" he said in a note to clients.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

COO Scott Smith left late last week.Up 2.8% for the day, the biotech group was ranked first just 26 weeks ago and fifth as recently as eight weeks ago. It's now slipped to No. 11 out of 197 groups tracked by Investor's Business Daily. Shares hit a 30-month high in March but have since toppled about 12% from that point.Abrahams calls for a strong quarter for Gilead. HIV drugs are becoming more important to the firm's top line and the hepatitis C market is stabilizing.More HIV patients are using regimens that contain a drug known as tenofovir alafenamide, or TAF. Among those, Abrahams sees Genvoya, Descovy and Odefsey beating expectations and taking share from its own Atripla and Stribild.Biktarvy, a three-drug treatment for HIV, is still early into its launch. It's expected to bring in $47 million in the first quarter, and ""sales look to be tracking ahead of the consensus projecting out longer term, in 2019,"" he said.Hepatitis C drugs Harvoni and Epclusa are seen beating views for $923 million. Abrahams models $1.02 billion for the two drugs. That's despite competition from AbbVie's (ABBV) new drug Mavyret, which treats a wide group of hepatitis C patients.""If the franchises perform as we expect, we could see an 8-cent bottom-line beat in the first quarter and earnings per share tracking to exceed the consensus for the year — which we believe would help drive upside as the pipeline matures and visibility increases into earnings growth in the out years,"" he said.Abrahams has an outperform rating on Gilead shares.Biogen looks ""generally solid"" for the first quarter. Abrahams expects $3.13 billion in sales to be slightly below the consensus for $3.15 billion based on prescription trends. He expects earnings per share to come in 8 cents below the consensus.Multiple sclerosis drug Tecfidera is experiencing steady erosion. But Celgene's experimental drug ozanimod has been delayed in multiple sclerosis. Meanwhile, revenue from spinal muscular atrophy drug Spinraza is likely to be in line.""With multiple sclerosis contracts for 2018 secured, key competitor ozanimod delayed and a temporary lull in competitive spinal muscular atrophy news flow, we expect the focus of the call to be on potential out-year growth drivers,"" he said.The biotech is expected to outline plans for aducanumab, which is being tested in Alzheimer's disease. Recently, Biogen made some changes to its studies for the drug. Investors also are likely to key in on potential acquisition talk.""We expect shares to trade in-line pending more clarity on the long-term picture,"" he said. Abrahams boosted his price target to 330 from 316. He has a sector perform rating on the stock.The first quarter tends to be seasonally weak for Celgene, ""though we believe it should be solid enough to allay any concerns emerging following the departure of their president/chief operating officer,"" Abrahams said.Abrahams boosted his expectations for inflammation drug Otezla to $346 million in the first quarter and $1.63 billion for the year — in line with consensus views. Otezla sales have been a source of pain in the past, widely missing in the third period before rebounding in the fourth.But Abrahams lowered views for Pomalyst, an anti-cancer drug, ""to reflect weaker-than-expected use patterns"" and the likelihood of indirect erosion from Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) Darzalex.Investor focus will be on the next steps for ozanimod after U.S. regulators rejected the drug in multiple sclerosis. Celgene could also offer up further details for Acceleron Pharma (XLRN)-partnered luspatercept in blood diseases.Abrahams cut his price target to 120 from 131. But he has Celgene as a top pick stock.RELATED:How Much Volume Should You Look For In A Stock?Long-Term Retirement Investing Strategies With ETFsStill The No. 1 Rule For Stock Investors: Always Cut Your Losses Short

18,COO,"LendingTree CEO Doug Lebda knows the key to business success lies in finding solutions to common problems.Lebda was trying to get a $55,000 mortgage to finance a condo in 1994, and faced the same issues many Americans deal with daily when they're shopping for a loan.""I got the runaround from the banks,"" said Lebda, who is also founder and chairman of LendingTree. ""They'd tell you one price and advertise another in the newspaper. I couldn't understand why I couldn't comparison-shop and there was no easy way to find the best deal on a mortgage. That was a problem that made me very angry.""Lebda's idea for what today is LendingTree (TREE) was born out of that frustration.Rather than give up, Lebda looked for ways to circumvent the hassle of searching for a mortgage. In the process, he pioneered the concept of an online loan marketplace and revolutionized the way Americans shop for loans and credit.Lebda started LendingTree in 1996, launched it nationally in 1998 and took it public in 2000.  Following his vision, today LendingTree is an online marketplace where consumers can comparison-shop across a full suite of loan- and credit-based offers from multiple lenders that compete for their business.Lebda honed his leadership and management skills from multiple sources. Experience led to valuable entrepreneurial insights. He also gleaned lessons from business consultant and author Jim Collins and former General Electric (GE) CEO Jack Welch. As a result, Lebda has led LendingTree through many cycles and challenges — from the dot.com bubble and subsequent meltdown to the housing crisis — and transformed it into an industry dynamo.Today, LendingTree is the leading online loan marketplace in terms of market share and size of its lender network, according to the company. It's No. 1 in market share for marketplaces/comparison-shopping sites on mortgages and personal loans. It has a network of over 500 lenders.As of the fourth quarter 2017, LendingTree has delivered EBITDA growth north of 50% in every quarter since 2014. EBITDA is defined as net income from continuing operations excluding interest, income taxes, amortization of intangibles and depreciation.LendingTree's share price has soared from 4.07 on Feb. 20, 2009, to 354.65 at Friday's close, a gain of 8,614%.What has propelled LendingTree's impressive stock performance?""They've diversified the business a great deal to have a larger addressable market,"" Needham & Co. analyst Kerry Rice told IBD. ""Their customers can use more than one product, and they continue to innovate and bring new products to market. Above all, under Doug's direction, they've executed very well. Doug has done a great job of laying out a strategic plan and executing on that plan. That's why the stock has performed so well.""Lebda's idea for LendingTree took shape in 1995, when he was doing some consulting with natural gas and oil companies for accounting firm PwC, where he worked as an accountant after graduating from Bucknell University in 1992.""I watched inefficient markets get very efficient through open marketplaces and transparency,"" said Lebda. ""I said to myself: 'Why can't you have an exchange or marketplace for loans like you have for natural gas and oil companies to help volatility? You should be able to create an efficient exchange to help consumers trying to find loans and lenders trying to find borrowers.'""Then my entrepreneurial thinking came in: If I could go to banks and sell them on the notion I could introduce them to customers over the internet and have them give prices to the consumer so the consumer could make a choice; we'll make the lenders compete online for their customers' business. LendingTree would be a marketplace that can serve the buyers and the sellers.""Lebda further developed his loan marketplace idea through a business plan in a competition at the Darden School of Business at the University of Virginia, where he started attending in 1995. He won second place. But he didn't give up.In 1996, Lebda went to a guest lecture by consultant Collins at Darden. Lebda was inspired by a story Collins told about the fact that the founder of L.L. Bean started the company around boot making because it solved the problem of people having wet feet.After that lecture, Lebda was determined to create a solution to a problem with his loan marketplace. He dropped out of business school to pursue his goal.But Lebda says he almost didn't start the company. Lebda decided to give himself one year, his ""affordable loss,"" to see if he could come up with an idea that gained the support of the industry. If he couldn't make something happen, he figured he'd go back to business school.As it turns out, the industry was open to his idea. Lebda says since he started LendingTree, he never thought about giving up.(Lebda waited until 2012 to go back to Darden. He received his MBA from there in 2014.)Lebda, 48, says his philosophy of leadership is through ""empowerment.""""I try to be very disciplined about what I can uniquely do and what others can do,"" he said. ""If they can do it better sometimes, I have them do it.""Lebda is a proponent of Collins. He aims to follow Collins' concept of ""Level 5 leadership,"" meaning Lebda gives credit to others and takes the blame himself.  That means, in part, that he ensures he has the right people in the right roles, and the right processes in place to endure the test of time.In addition, Lebda urges employees to challenge the status quo — and their bosses. He welcomes a debate if there are objections.  Lebda encourages and invites others to share their knowledge, explain their opinions and back up their positions.When Lebda started the company, he laid the foundation with a set of guiding principles of a company he would like to work for.Some of Lebda's core principles:Build truly outstanding products. Find breakthrough ways to surprise and delight customers with insight and clarity.Be open and candid. Mistakes are fine, as long as they're small, quick, not repeated, and we learn from them.Act with urgency and creativity. Search for ideas everywhere. Test, debate and develop ideas until you quickly find the best answer. Then, execute with urgency and a sense of purpose.Take charge. Ask for the ball. Make a decision and stand by it.Commit to excellence. Keep learning, and don't be afraid to take on more responsibility and tackle larger challenges. Encourage, help and teach others so they can reach their full potential, too.Lebda says LendingTree overcame the impact of the dot.com meltdown and housing crisis by adhering to these principles and common practices.""We kept our heads down and remained focused on our internal metrics,"" Lebda said. ""We had our eye on what we could become five, 10 years down the road — and made sure we had the right people in the right roles and the right strategy to help us get there.""Lebda also led LendingTree through a major metamorphosis by drawing on such principles: In 2003, LendingTree was acquired by IAC/InterActive (IAC), which is controlled by media mogul Barry Diller. A few years later, in 2008, IAC spun off LendingTree as its own public company, and Lebda resumed his position as LendingTree's CEO.Lebda was IAC's president and chief operating officer from 2005 to 2008. During this time, Lebda oversaw websites such as Match.com, HomeAdvisor.com and Expedia.com and learned a lot from the experience.Lebda says marketplaces like Expedia run on the same ""physics"" as LendingTree.While at IAC, Lebda learned a lot about leadership as well as managing and transforming a business under the tutelage of Jack Welch, who was a consultant for IAC while Lebda was there.Lebda says Welch reinforced everything he learned from Collins.""(Welch) really showed me that leadership has to be through other people, and as you grow you can't do it yourself,"" Lebda said.Welch also taught him how to transition from one role to another.""When you start a company, you're a player. Then you have to get off the playing field and be a coach,"" Lebda said. ""Then at the next level of growth you go from being a coach to being a general manager making trade-offs and thinking mostly about creating the best team.""Welch strongly influenced Lebda's future path when IAC spun off LendingTree. At the time, LendingTree was struggling amid the housing and mortgage crisis.""(Welch) convinced me to leave that job (as president and COO of IAC) and try to turn LendingTree around,"" Lebda said. ""Jack said: 'You'll regret it if you don't return to LendingTree.' He said I'd be an idiot not to.""So Lebda analyzed ways to turn LendingTree around. In examining LendingTree's assets, he found the company had a ""great brand name, a huge customer file and a lot of opportunities for growth.""Lebda's plan: Expand into new categories such as personal loans.""We had a great position in mortgages and added more capacity in our mortgage business,"" he said. ""We were able to create My LendingTree — a new platform for consumers to better understand their credit profile, and offer ways to save money on their current loans and credit cards.""My LendingTree has over 6 million consumers enrolled.How does Lebda see the future?""Our vision for the future is we want to be ubiquitous in helping every customer regardless of your credit situation,"" he said.Another goal: ""Every lender will work with LendingTree and LendingTree will be an integral part of the way they find new customers,"" he added.In addition, Lebda aims to make LendingTree ""as good as Amazon.com (AMZN) as a highly personalized experience, giving you what you want, when you want it. """"That's what My LendingTree is about,"" he said. ""It's a highly personalized experience of your having a relationship with us. We can save you money on credit cards, mortgages, student loans, auto loans and more by using real-time data and machine learning.""Pioneered the concept of an online loan marketplace.Overcame: the dot.com meltdown and the housing crisis.Lesson: ""My management philosophy is one where a CEO articulates a key set of principles for his company and makes sure they're commonly held.""

23,COO,"HOUSTON — Boeing (BA) envisions commercial developments in the biotech and fiber-optic industries helping fund the International Space Station after government funding runs out for the orbiting laboratory.XOperating costs for the ISS have been estimated at $3 billion-$4 billion a year, with the bulk coming from the U.S. government. Boeing has a contract with NASA to operate and maintain the ISS, which is also used by more than a dozen other countries.But under President Trump's 2019 budget request announced last month, federal ISS outlays will end in 2025 as the administration pushes NASA to shift resources toward a moon base and deep-space exploration missions to Mars and beyond.John Vollmer, Boeing's ISS chief engineer, has been on the program since its inception and told IBD recently that a public-private partnership might be the answer for the future of the space station, which has been in service for 20 years.""Ultimately, the government is trying to reduce the cost so they can spend more money on deep space,"" he said in an interview at Boeing's facility near NASA's Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center. ""We understand that and support that. What we need to do ... is  look at those technologies that are mature enough to become commercialized"" to fund the station.There are already commercial technology advances on earth thanks to the ISS.Biotech Amgen (AMGN) claimed it developed its Prolia and Xgeva osteoporosis drugs quicker on the ISS than on the ground, said Scott Copeland, Boeing's senior manager for research integration, specialty and systems engineering on the ISS.Printing organs for people on the transplant list could be a viable ISS business too. Sometime this year, Techshot will send up its 3D space biofabrication lab to the ISS to test organ printing in microgravity.Currently, stomachs and other pliable organs can be printed on earth with the help of a supporting structure. However, a more complex organ like a heart can't be printed because it would be damaged by gravity when the support scaffolding is removed.Copeland also said that stem cells have been developed faster in microgravity vs. on earth.Fiber optics are another possible commercial growth area for the ISS. Gravity causes fibers grown on earth to have impurities and misshapen crystals. But an experiment by Made In Space last year found that fibers grown in microgravity didn't have the same impurities.Revenue from commercial applications on the ISS isn't currently enough to cover the $3 billion in NASA funding for the ISS, Boeing spokesman Steven Siceloff noted, adding that the decision to privatize the ISS will be made by the president, Congress and NASA.Sign Up For Free IBD Newsletters: Market Prep | Tech ReportBoeing's Starliner crewed capsule, which is expected to be test launched with humans later this year, will help push the development of commercial applications, Vollmer said, as the so-called space taxi brings up potential experiments and payload developers.The ISS also has a long potential service life to capitalize on its commercial potential. The space station could last until at least 2040 with routine maintenance, he said.""I think we need to look carefully at how we utilize the station and how we make the most effective use of this national asset we have,"" Vollmer said.

31,COO,"Restaurant chains Wendy's (WEN), Jack in the Box (JACK) and Cheesecake Factory (CAKE) turned out mixed results late Wednesday.X Estimates: Fourth-quarter earnings per share of 12 cents, a 50% jump, on revenue of $315 million, up 2%, according to Zacks Investment Research. System-wide same-store sales in North America were expected to increase 1.8%, according to Consensus Metrix.Results: Preliminary Q4 North America same-store sales rose 1.3%;  EPS of 11 cents; revenue was $309.2 million.Wendy's said it expected 2018 same-store sales growth in North America of around 2%-2.5%.Stock: Shares slid 2.9% after hours in the stock market today, trying to retake support at their 50-day line.As with the other chains reporting Wednesday, Wendy's faces tough competition from the likes of McDonald's (MCD) and others. RBC analysts said they believe that sales trends have slowed for the company despite its 4 for $4 discount deal, which RBC said has helped draw customers since it debuted in 2015.RBC analysts said they would be interested to see how the company might move forward, as rivals turn to cheap-food deals that appear to be picking up market share.""Wendy's has recently emphasized its fresh beef — directly contrasting that to McDonald's,"" RBC analyst David Palmer wrote in a research note last week. ""Our guess is that Wendy's is attempting to position itself as the 'original' fresh beef player, and McDonald's as a copycat when it introduces fresh beef quarter-pounder later this year.""He also wondered whether Wendy's might use any benefits from President Trump's tax cuts toward a makeover of its stores. Wendy's has already installed self-ordering kiosks at its restaurants, while McDonald's plans to spend big on a digital overhaul. Estimates: Fiscal first-quarter earnings per share of $1.06, down 10%, as revenue slides 41% to $286 million.

That deal is expected to close in April.Jack in the Box's results also follow January's announcement that Frances Allen would resign as brand president on Feb. 9, and Marcus Tom would come aboard on Feb. 12 as the company's new COO. Earlier in January, the company said that Lance Tucker would become Jack in the Box's new CFO in March, replacing Jerry Rebel, who last year announced plans to retire from the company when it hired a successor.Cowen analyst Andrew Charles, in a research note last week, said it could take time for the new management to shape and carry out new plans.""We note in the latter part of fiscal 1Q18, the industry softened, MCD launched the $1, $2, $3 Dollar Menu on Jan 4th and Jack's brand president resigned shortly after 1Q ended,"" he wrote. ""We previously expressed our belief Jack is the most susceptible publicly-traded (quick-service restaurant) sandwich company to donating share to MCD.""Estimates: Q4 EPS of 53 cents, a 21% drop, as revenue falls 6% to $567 million.

34,COO,"Futures for the S&P 500 index and Nasdaq 100 were mixed vs. fair value early Thursday. Alibaba (BABA) fell 3% as the Chinese e-commerce giant fell shy of earnings estimates. Apple (AAPL) reports later tonight, along with Amazon (AMZN) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL)X Overnight, iPhone chipmaker Qorvo (QRVO) shot up on its earnings after Broadcom (AVGO) released positive sales figures early Wednesday, offering some hope for Apple's stock.Meanwhile, Facebook (FB) sold off initially on earnings late Wednesday but then rebounded. PayPal (PYPL) fell modestly in early after-hours action, but then plunged late in the session,S&P 500 index futures were fractionally higher vs. fair value. Nasdaq 100 and Dow futures fell 0.1%.Keep in mind that extended trading does not always translate into how a stock will open or close in the followingvvv regular session. Volume will be much heavier, while analysts and investors will have more time to sift through the figures and comments.Facebook topped adjusted earnings and sales growth estimates, but shares sold off more than 4% in early after-hours trading after CEO Mark Zuckerberg said changes to its News Feed reduced users' time on the site by 50 million hours every day. Daily active users in the U.S. and Canada fell for the first time ever, falling to 184 million users from 185 million in Q3.But late in the post-earnings call with analysts, Facebook said ad rates have soared. COO Sheryl Sandberg said News Feed changes may reduce how much time people spend on Facebook but shouldn't affect profitability. Facebook turned higher and was up about 1% in premarket trading.Facebook closed down 0.1% at 186.89 in Wednesday's stock market trading.The online payments processor reported a 30% earnings-per-share gain for the fourth quarter. PayPal also gave largely in-line guidance for 2018. Shares initially fell modestly in late trade after rising to a record high during Wednesday's regular session. But then former parent eBay (EBAY), which also reported earnings after hours, said it would drop PayPal as its online payment provider for Dutch firm Adyen. The eBay deal with PayPal doesn't fully end until 2020 and eBay said it'll accept PayPal as an option until at least July 2023. But PayPal fell much further, trading down more than 8% in premarket action.Qorvo reported better-than-expected fiscal Q3 results late Wednesday, but guided low for the current Q4, citing weaker handset sales. That offered further, implicit confirmation that Apple will cut guidance when it reports holiday-quarter results Thursday night.But Qorvo shot up 11.5% to 80 in late trade. That's after rising nearly 6% so far this week, retaking its 50-day and 200-day moving average. Admittedly, Qorvo's late-night gains likely reflect the company's hints that it will get a bigger share of chips in the iPhone.But Qorvo's recent action also suggests the bad news may be priced in, at least for iPhone chipmakers.Before Wednesday's open, Broadcom, another Apple chipmaker, reported preliminary sales that were above estimates, while also guiding high for current-quarter revenue. Shares rose 2.9% during the regular session, though they closed below their 200-day moving average.As for Apple itself, the tech titan's shares closed up 0.3% to 167.43.Apple is still down for 2018, trading well below its 50-day moving average and a 176.35 flat-base buy point. Worse, the relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, is holding at its worst levels since mid-June. Investors should be focusing on stocks that are truly leading the market.Qorvo and other suppliers and other measures suggest that Apple is seeing weaker iPhone X demand.

36,COO,"SpaceX said Tuesday that its Falcon 9 rocket ""did everything correctly"" on Sunday, when a spy satellite made by Northrop Grumman (NOC) was reportedly lost after launch.X SpaceX and Tesla (TSLA) founder Elon Musk tweeted photos of the Falcon 9's first stage successfully returning to Earth.But Ars Technica reported Monday that the mission wasn't ever officially declared a success, and the Wall Street Journal later reported that lawmakers and congressional staffers from the Senate and the House were informed that the Zuma payload likely didn't separate from the rocket and fell back to earth.Sources told Bloomberg that the Falcon 9's second stage failed, with both the satellite and the second-stage booster falling into the ocean.But SpaceX said everything on its end looks OK so far and isn't changing the schedule of another Falcon 9 launch and the Falcon Heavy's maiden flight later this month.""For clarity: after review of all data to date, Falcon 9 did everything correctly on Sunday night,"" President and COO Gwynne Shotwell said in a statement. ""If we or others find otherwise based on further review, we will report it immediately. Information published that is contrary to this statement is categorically false. Due to the classified nature of the payload, no further comment is possible.""The launch had been delayed from November so SpaceX could analyze data from the protective nose cone from another launch.In October, Wired reported that Northrop custom built an adapter to marry up its satellite with the Falcon 9, rather than use SpaceX's standard interface. Northrop declined to comment, citing the classified nature of the Zuma mission.Northrop shares closed up 0.7% at 310.39 on the stock market today. Boeing (BA) rose 2.7%, and Lockheed Martin (LMT), whose United Launch Alliance joint venture with Boeing provides launch services for the Pentagon, added 0.7%.IBD'S TAKE: A new Space Age is dawning as billionaires like Elon Musk and Amazon's Jeff Bezos look to explore deeper into the final frontier and make space exploration and commercial development more affordable.  Little is known about the Zuma satellite.  Northrop made it for a government customer and was supposed to be launched into low Earth orbit, where the International Space Station, reconnaissance, weather and communications satellites reside.And whether the Zuma had a military or civilian applications or which agency would operate it was also kept under tight wraps, though it reportedly was a spy satellite.The lack of basic details surrounding the launch was highly unusual even compared to SpaceX's national-security launches — a Boeing X-37B for the Air Force in September and a spy satellite for the National Reconnaissance Office in May — where the customers and some details of the payloads were disclosed.A botched Zuma mission could raise some doubts as upstart SpaceX looks to launch more government payloads and test its human capsule later this year.It may also delay its first Falcon Heavy launch scheduled for later this month, potentially affecting other planned contracts for the new rocket.Sometime early this year, the Falcon Heavy is set to launch a Arabsat satellite built by Lockheed. And as soon as April, SpaceX's Falcon Heavy will be used in the U.S. Air Force's Space Test Program-2 mission, which is comprised of military and scientific research satellites.YOU MAY BE INTERESTED IN: SpaceX, Boeing To Take This Giant Leap For Space Industry In 2018Boeing, Apple Could Build A Parallel Internet In SpaceDefense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsSpace Industry News And Top Aerospace Stocks

38,COO,"In 2013, when Pam Nicholson took the steering wheel of Enterprise Holdings Inc., the world's largest car rental firm, she was ready.Starting as a manager trainee right out of college in 1981, Nicholson did everything from washing cars to marketing as she moved up the ranks of the company until she was named COO in 2003. Four years later, she oversaw the company's game-changing acquisition of the National Car Rental and Alamo Rent A Car brands. Andy Taylor, who at the time was CEO and is the son of Jack Taylor, who founded the firm in 1957, was so impressed he recommended her as his successor, the first outside the family to helm the private company.""Just like 99% of our senior management team, I learned the business from the ground up, so I had hands-on experience in nearly every facet of our business,"" Nicholson told IBD from her office in St. Louis, Mo. ""I truly understand the challenges people are facing because I've been there before. We're a meritocracy, promoting from within and paying for performance, so my job as a leader is to empower others to harness their strengths and reach their full potential, which helps the entire organization deliver outstanding results.""Nicholson's own results are fully recognized, with Fortune magazine ranking her No. 17 on its recent list of most powerful women in U.S. business.Nicholson, 58, grew up in St. Louis and graduated from the University of Missouri-Columbia. Within nine months, she was made assistant manager in a local office and a few months later was sent to the Southern California market. It only had a fleet of 1,000 cars, but the company could see the enormous potential.Her competitive instincts were honed as she entered horse-jumping contests in her 20s and 30s. Within 12 years, she was made regional vice president of the Southern California group, whose fleet had reached 27,000.""I learned about how to hire the right people and then continually train and mentor them to provide the consistent customer service we're known for,"" said Nicholson. ""No matter where they work in the world, they get promoted based on the same measurements of performance that reveal both ability and talent. If you don't meet your goals, you don't get promoted, and everyone embraces that.""With such attention to developing good leaders at every level and retaining the best employees, it's no wonder that Enterprise has continued to win awards from magazines Workforce, Chief Learning Officer, and Training. Nicholson is the highest-ranking woman to receive the 2017 Glassdoor Employees' Choice Award, with a 95% approval rating.Today, some 10,000 new employees, as well as 2,000 interns, are hired each year through the renowned Enterprise Rent-A-Car Management Training Program. CollegeGrad.com ranks it No. 1 for entry level jobs, and the company prioritizes military veterans and reservists for recruitment.Enterprise Holdings and its network of regional subsidiaries — including nearly 10,000 neighborhood and airport locations — currently employ more than 100,000 people. And every year, they rent and lease about 1.9 million vehicles, made up of 450 makes and models.In 1994, Nicholson was brought back to headquarters as a corporate vice president. Three years later, she moved back into the rental business as general manager of the New York regional subsidiary, whose profitability she doubled in two years. She returned to St. Louis in 1999 as senior VP of North American operations. In 2003, Nicholson was appointed chief operating officer and became responsible for all day-to-day operations. Chrissy Taylor, the daughter of now Executive Chairman Andy Taylor, is the current COO and Nicholson is responsible for mentoring her, just as mentors helped her master the skills she needed as she advanced.""The late Jack Taylor used to ask me, 'Are you having fun?' "" said Nicholson. ""There's no reason we can't both work hard and have a good time doing it, which helps us deliver better customer service, since it's far easier to make other people happy when you're happy.""Enterprise had long specialized in offering free pickup of customers from their neighborhood offices, including providing cars for customers of insurance companies, whose own autos were being repaired. As a result, it had only 8% of the airport market. Then in 2007, Nicholson supervised the integration of two new brands: National Car Rental, which primarily served business travelers, and Alamo Rent A Car, which catered to value-oriented domestic travelers and foreign visitors to North America. After the acquisition, the three brands together had 28% of the airport market and that has now grown to 38%.""On the day the acquisition was completed, we delivered a small book titled 'GR8 DAY' to every Enterprise, National and Alamo employee,"" said Nicholson. ""It stated that we had all become part of a company dedicated to three things: 1) Listening to and satisfying our customers; 2) Creating opportunities for our employees; and 3) Achieving long-term sustainable growth. Just as importantly, the book stressed that we were going to take our time to carefully review all organizational, customer, and cultural issues. Above all else, we wanted to make sure that we got the integration process right, because, just like a first impression, you only get one chance to do a merger well. Ten years later, I think our deliberative approach has paid off enormously.""But she says that while the airport presence was the primary driver for the deal, there were other important benefits.""We also learned a lot about ourselves and changed our company in ways that have equipped us for faster growth on a global scale,"" said Nicholson, who added the title of president in 2008. ""Our biggest lesson from the integration is that our company can execute a major acquisition without risk to our fundamental values and culture.""Enterprise set up its first European franchise at the end of 2012. As CEO starting the next year, Nicholson continued the company's focus on franchising overseas. It now has offices covering 95% of the car rental market in more than 90 countries and territories.""Our robust growth is a tribute to the strong international reputation of our brands,"" she said. ""We have a very clear vision of how Enterprise, National and Alamo customers should be treated. As a result, we have developed a strong international network of exceptional franchise partners who share our passion for excellence across the board. Good customer service translates well in any language or culture. Yet that core competency is always balanced with an intuitive understanding of local cultures and characteristics, which means we are learning as much from our partners as they are from us. It's definitely a two-way street.""Nicholson says that the expansion needs to rest on a foundation of entrepreneurialism, where decisions are made as locally as possible. She also oversees the Enterprise Fleet Management affiliate, which has 50 offices and manages a fleet of 470,000 vehicles in the U.S. and Canada, with full-service management for companies, government agencies and organizations having midsize fleets of 20 or more. That business recently invested $100 million in its information-technology infrastructure.""I think many people have been surprised by how quickly technology is changing the automotive industry,"" said Nicholson. ""We believe we should let innovation and responsiveness to consumer needs determine which business models and technologies thrive in the market, allowing a pragmatic and market-driven solution to evolve, supported by infrastructure and appropriate public policies. We think the car rental industry may be one of the early adopters of autonomous vehicles, since many drivers first experience new automotive technologies in rental vehicles. While potential liability issues need to be evaluated, our industry can efficiently introduce new autonomous vehicles to millions of consumers.""During Nicholson's tenure as COO, revenue for the company and its Fleet Management affiliate more than doubled. Since becoming CEO, revenue has increased from $16.4 billion in fiscal 2013 to more than $22.3 billion in fiscal 2017 ending July 31, exceeding the combined size of its chief competitors, Hertz Global Holdings (HTZ), with $9.4 billion, and Avis Budget Group (CAR), with $8.5 billion.In 2017, National and Enterprise took the top two spots respectively in Travel & Leisure's World's Best Awards for car rental agencies, and it also earned the same rankings by Business Travel News. Money magazine gave its top award to Alamo and second place to Enterprise.Executive Chairman Taylor believes that the ongoing success reflects ""Pam's leadership, passion and dedication to grow the business, with the help of every employee, and she continues to have an impact as a leader across all industries.""CEO of Enterprise Holdings Inc., the world's largest car rental company.Overcame: Challenges of integrating National Car Rental and Alamo Rent A Car.Lesson: Make sure all the core values of the company are clearly understood and implemented consistently everywhere. ""Don't sell yourself short. Set your goals high.""

39,COO,"Airbus (EADSY) said Friday that CEO Tom Enders will step down when his term ends in February 2019 and COO Fabrice Bregier, who had been seen as his successor, will leave in February.X The shake-up comes as the aerospace giant faces investigations in several European countries and pushes for a settlement with French and U.K. anti-corruption authorities.Guillaume Faury, currently CEO of Airbus Helicopters, will become head of the commercial aircraft unit, potentially putting him next in line to be CEO though the company said it will conduct a search for a new chief.But Airbus held off on giving Faury the title of COO and will decide after Bregier leaves, sources told Bloomberg.The company will examine CEO candidate inside and outside Airbus with the goal of announcing a pick at the annual shareholder meeting in 2019.Airbus' U.S.-listed shares closed down 0.5% at 24.92 on the stock market today after slumping 4% Thursday on reports of the shake-up. Rival Boeing (BA) ended flat at 293.94. Boeing lost out to Airbus in a massive $12.7 billion order from Delta Air Lines (DAL) Thursday.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now?

The Federal Reserve offered few surprises. Media stocks were in focus with Disney buying most of 21st Century Fox and the GOP-led FCC rolling back net neutrality.Bitcoin futures on the Cboe (CBOE) got off to a strong start, trading at their best levels on Friday amid typically volatile moves for the cryptocurrency. Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen said that Bitcoin played a very small role in the payments landscape, but that it was ""not a stable store of value"" and ""highly speculative."" Her remarks add to the chorus of banking officials weighing in on the much-hyped cryptocurrency. They echo those of Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein and others who believe Bitcoin, which can gain or lose thousands of dollars in a day, can't be depended on to retain consistent value.CME Group (CME) will launch its Bitcoin futures on Dec. 18.The megadeal is a reality: Disney is buying Fox's entertainment assets for an enterprise value of $66.1 billion. It includes 20th Century Fox's movie and TV studios, National Geographic, FX, 22 Fox regional sports networks, and certain international assets. Disney CEO Bob Iger, who is extending his contract past 2019 to 2021 because of the merger, expressed enthusiasm about the deal's ability to boost the media giant's direct-to-consumer strategy and spread the ESPN brand internationally. It's not clear how regulators feel about the transaction, and Disney has promised a $2.5 billion breakup fee. Fox will keep its broadcast, news as well sports networks FS1, FS2 and Big Ten Network. Disney and Fox shares soared.Separately, Disney should expect a windfall from its latest entrant to the ""Star Wars"" franchise, ""The Last Jedi,"" which has already garnered largely positive reviews from critics and early viewers.

State regulators, Comcast and others said Congress should step in and pass internet legislation. One analyst put the chances of that at less than 30%.The Federal Reserve raised rates at its final meeting of the year, as expected. Policymakers also still expect to raise interest rates three times next year and didn't seem concerned about Trump tax cuts overheating the economy. Economic data backed a Goldilocks scenario.

41,COO,"As a once-shocking idea edges toward a finish and Walt Disney (DIS) appears poised to acquire certain 21st Century Fox (FOXA) assets, CNBC is reporting Wednesday that Disney CEO Bob Iger is likely to push back his retirement yet again, and stay for two to three years after the finalization of a possible deal.X If that happens, that would mark the fourth time that Iger has extended his tenure at the House of Mouse. Most recently, in March, Disney announced that Iger had extended his contract in the top spot to July 2019, up from June 2018. He had told analysts and investors then that he would be ""open to"" prolonging his tenure if it was in the best interest of the company.One day prior, Financial Times sources said Fox CEO James Murdoch, son of Rupert Murdoch, has been ""suggested"" during talks as a possible successor to Iger when he eventually retires.Since then-COO Tom Staggs left Disney in May of last year, the hunt has been on for someone to eventually step into Iger's high-profile role; 24-year Disney veteran and theme parks head Bob Chapek was the latest name to be bandied about as a top contender for the spot.If a Disney-Fox deal goes through, Murdoch would likely become a senior executive at Disney, said FT on Tuesday, although ""no promises have been made.""Reports of a possible transaction include the sale of Twentieth Century Fox, cable networks FX and National Geographic, plus Fox's stake in UK-based Sky and India's Star TV, to Disney. Fox would hold onto its sports, news and broadcast networks. CNBC sources put the enterprise value of those Fox assets at $60 billion.Official confirmation of a deal could be announced as soon as next week, said CNBC early Tuesday, citing sources.Indications came earlier in the week, via Bloomberg, that Fox was leaning toward Disney as a preferred buyer, given its position as a strategic fit and the possibility of less regulatory red tape.But NBCUniversal parent Comcast (CMCSA) and Verizon Communications (VZ) have also been said to be suitors of Fox's assets. Comcast is interested in full control of pay-TV giant Sky as part of any deal for Fox's assets, according to Bloomberg.Shares of Disney fell 1.6% to 105.46 in the stock market today. Fox, meanwhile, gained 0.7% to 33.21 Wednesday after hitting a two-year intraday high Tuesday.Earlier in the week, Piper Jaffray analyst Stan Meyers called the move ""a clear positive"" for Disney, particularly as it readies its stand-alone streaming platform that threatens to rival Netflix (NFLX).""Fox's extensive library would significantly improve the breadth of content available on Disney's direct to consumer platform, further transforming it into a must-have subscription,"" he wrote.The transaction would add to Disney's already-massive library of content, and bring ""X-Men"" back into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Plus, it might nix some of the focus on Disney's plodding media networks segment, which includes ESPN.""Importantly, a deal would further diversify revenue streams away from the pay-TV ecosystem, a continued overhang on the stock,"" said Meyers.But Meyers conceded that regulatory risks might arise, as a Disney-Fox transaction ""would likely raise numerous antitrust and regulatory concerns, in our view, especially in the aftermath of the Time Warner-AT&T deal drawing greater scrutiny to Media consolidation.""The Justice Department last month objected to the planned AT&T (T) takeover of Time Warner (TWX) as anticompetitive.RELATED:The Fox Likes The Mouse Better Than Comcast: ReportDisney's Parks Chief Emerges As Contender To Succeed IgerComcast, Verizon Reportedly Eyeing 21st Century Fox Assets'We Can't Believe This Is Serious': Does A Disney-Fox Deal Make Sense?8 Key Facts: What Disney's Rogue Move Means For Netflix SubscribersStreaming Content May Become King, But Who Will Wear The Crown?

43,COO,"At the ceremony to break ground last year on a new Toy Story Land in Shanghai, Walt Disney's (DIS) Bob Iger was beaming. To his right, and dressed similarly in a black sweater, was the man who could very well take his place as chief executive officer: Bob Chapek.X Shanghai Disneyland went on to exceed 11 million visitors in its first year. That was a big boost for Chapek, who has delivered steady returns as head of the parks and resorts division. In Disney's fiscal year-end results announced Nov. 9, Chapek's business was the only one of four major units to post an increase in sales and profit.Chapek, whose 24-year career at Disney has included roles in the film studio and consumer products, is now viewed as a likely successor to Iger, according to people familiar with the company. While no formal decision has been made, Disney is under pressure to find a replacement because Iger is scheduled to retire in July 2019, leaving 19 months to complete a transition. If history is any guide, Disney may soon name a chief operating officer or president, currently unoccupied roles that Iger held for five years before becoming CEO in 2005.Chapek's well-rounded experience is appealing for a company whose business ranges from selling toys in malls to churning out ""Star Wars"" films. He stands out at a time when other parts of the business are sputtering. Disney's once-vaunted TV division, home to ESPN, ABC and other channels, reported its second straight year of declining profit this month, as consumers shift to online viewing. The company's film studio, while still the envy of the industry, was dealt a blow last week when Pixar's chief creative officer, John Lasseter, took a six-month sabbatical following allegations of inappropriate behavior.Since taking over the theme-park division in February 2015, Chapek ensured the Shanghai resort, Disney's largest foreign investment, turned a profit in its first year of operation. He also guided the openings of an ""Avatar""-themed attraction in Orlando, Florida, and a ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" ride in Anaheim, California, that have led to attendance gains this year at the company's domestic theme parks.In July Chapek unveiled a flurry of new projects at the parks, including a ""Star Wars""-themed hotel in Orlando and Marvel superhero rides in Anaheim. Disney told investors on Nov. 9 that its budget for investments in the parks will expand this fiscal year by about $1 billion.Fortunes rise and fall within Disney all the time, and a leading contender can quickly lose favor. Iger, 66, has thrice postponed retirement with contract extensions, but said last month that ""this time I mean it."" While Disney has conducted a multiyear succession process in the past, a number of senior managers who would have been candidates to replace Iger have left the company, among them former Chief Financial Officer Jay Rasulo and Thomas Staggs, another former parks chief.Disney was little changed at $102.67 at 9:41 a.m. in New York. The stock has declined about 1.4% so far this year.Staggs was seen as the likely heir given his promotion to COO in February 2015, more than two years in advance of Iger's then-scheduled retirement. But last year he stepped down after being told the board had lost confidence in him.Chapek joined Disney after working in marketing at H.J. Heinz Co., the food-processing company, and at agency J. Walter Thompson. At Disney, Chapek reorganized the consumer-products division, cutting jobs and focusing the business on brands rather than lines of merchandise.At the parks division, Chapek has focused on pricing, introducing a tiered system of tickets that cost more during peak times and eliminating some annual passes. He's searched for ways to get patrons to pay extra for perks such as nighttime events and passes to get to the head of the line in the company's California parks.An Indiana native, Chapek cultivates palm trees at his homes in California and Florida. He said in an interview earlier this year that when he was growing up, his family went to Walt Disney World as an annual holiday outing.""I was sort of umbilically tied to it from the time I was really young,"" Chapek said. ""So, coming to Disney was a dream for me.""Investors are likely to find out in the coming months whether he's exceeded even his wildest dreams.

59,COO,"Eighty-four years ago, I was born in the United States. I was educated here, served in our military, joined a small company when it started up, and ultimately became its chief operating officer. After retirement, I started and developed other businesses and foundations. Some have said I am a ""doer.""But I can't figure out our tax code. It is now so impossible to understand that I cannot prepare my own return, or even determine if my professional preparers have done it correctly, notwithstanding that I have a law degree and have studied the tax code extensively.In my lifetime, our tax code has gone from about 500 pages to nearly 75,000 pages. The top marginal tax rate on ordinary income has ranged from 28% to 94%, and on capital gains from 15% to 40%. On estates, the rate has ranged from 0% to 55%. Deductions and credits have been altered, denied, capped, taken away and reinstated. Stealth taxes like the alternative minimum tax and ObamaCare taxes have been slipped into the code. I could probably better predict the weather every day for the next year than I could predict how much of my income will be taxed away in any given year.Why is this complexity, craziness and lack of predictability a severe demotivator for doers? For the same reason those conditions demotivate people in every endeavor.Who among us wants to devote time, talent and treasure to activities where compliance with the rules makes simple things extremely complex? Would you take a trip to New York if you had to first get a visa from every county in every state you pass through to get there?Who wants to compete in contests where the game is so crazy that you don't know what you have to do in order to win? Would you compete in a golf tournament if you didn't know what constituted a stroke, whether the fewest or the most strokes wins, and what sort of situations would disqualify you?Who wants to pursue anything where the regulations that govern our activity are subject to the day-to-day whims of the regulators. Would you play baseball if the umpire behind home plate could retroactively redefine the strike zone after every pitch?None of us would. We all want simplicity, understandability and predictability in the rules that govern what we do.Our current federal tax system is complex and unpredictable. It is widely despised and distrusted. As a result, it demotivates the doers in our society, while wasting billions of our dollars and hours trying to figure out how to comply — time and money that could be much better spent starting new businesses and creating jobs.Why do we allow our federal tax system to be such a demotivator? There are probably many reasons, but they certainly include the desire of politicians to make the system ever more complex so they can carve out special favors for potential campaign contributors and voters; the desire of IRS employees for job security and staff expansion; the desire of legions of accountants and lawyers, who must be hired by taxpayers, to do tax planning, prepare returns and lobby Washington for favors; and the fact that nearly half of our citizens pay no income tax at all and so don't much care how complex, mysterious and unpredictable the tax system is.We must reform our federal tax system to make it simple, easy to understand and predictable. If we don't, we will continue to smother our economy and make the American dream unobtainable for most Americans. Doers do, so let's get busy. Continuing to kick the can down the road will only shorten the limited time we have to save our country from continuing economic decline.

The additional $5 billion at the top line should add $2.5 billion to pretax earnings.The breadth of the expected gains suggests Goldman may be looking beyond its vaunted trading desk to spark more growth, as persistent low market volatility continues to weigh on transactions.Earlier Tuesday, JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon warned that Q3 trading revenue would be down 20%.Dimon also dismissed Bitcoin as a fraud and vowed to immediately fire any trader who trades the cryptocurrency, which has soared in value in recent months.""It's worse than tulip bulbs. It won't end well. Someone is going to get killed,"" Dimon said, according to CNBC.Goldman shares closed up 2.2% on the stock market today, retaking their 50-day average. JPMorgan rose 1.2%, Citigroup (C) climbed 1.6%, Morgan Stanley (MS) gained 1.31%, and Bank of America (BAC) added 2.5%, helped by another boost to bond yields.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.On Monday, Citigroup's CFO said markets revenue is on pace to come in roughly 15% lower than a year ago.JPMorgan and Citi had previously hinted at weak Q3 performance, and last month, Goldman CFO Martin Chavez said the low volatility seen in Q2 has spilled over into Q3, after reporting a 40% drop in Q2 FICC revenue.On its Q2 earnings call in July, Goldman said it ""didn't navigate the market as well as we aspire to or as well as we have in the past,"" echoing similar language on its Q1 call, when trading also suffered.The underperformance helped rival Morgan Stanley briefly surpass Goldman in market value, as its Q2 fixed-income trading revenue fell only 4%.RELATED:Bitcoin Dips Amid China's Currency Crackdown; Kin ICO ComingBig Banks Aren't Ignoring Bitcoin Anymore, Still WaryBofA, Goldman Beat But See Trading, Net Interest Income WeaknessFrustrated JPMorgan CEO Unleashes This Tirade On U.S. 'Stupidity'

64,COO,"As former General Electric (GE) CEO Jeff Immelt has emerged in the lead to become the new chief of Uber, his role in transforming a century-old manufacturing company into a digital-industrial powerhouse is seen as making him an ideal fit for the ride-sharing service in deep need of a cultural makeover.XBesides infusing each of GE's core businesses with technology, Immelt served as a diplomat and statesman for GE, while slimming down the conglomerate, driving GE's push into China 15 years ago, and fostering a noted compliance culture, said Deane Dray, a managing director at RBC Capital Markets.""It's an opportunity for Jeff Immelt to provide that 'celebrity CEO' (cachet) but from the standpoint of a known, high-caliber executive,"" Dray told IBD. ""GE has made such a big investment in its digital capability, the Predix platform. I can't help thinking that is a factor in why he is being considered"" for the role at Uber.The search for a new head at Uber follows the forced resignation of CEO and co-founder Travis Kalanick in June, following months of upheaval at the tech startup. Among other troubles, a former Uber engineer accused the company of widespread sexism, an Uber board member resigned after a sexist remark, and Benchmark, one of Uber's biggest investors, is suing Kalanick for fraud and breach of fiduciary duty.With a ""bro"" culture seen as a key issue, top Silicon Valley women like Facebook (FB) COO Sheryl Sandberg and former Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) CEO Meg Whitman were seen as possible Uber CEOs.But instead, a majority of the Uber board is coalescing around Immelt, sources told Recode, and the two other executives in the running are also men.Meanwhile, one of Uber's earliest investors has proposed another top pick for CEO: Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk. A pact between Tesla and Uber would give Uber the autonomous driving technology it badly needs and expand Tesla's presence in many more markets, angel investor Jason Calacanis said according to CNBC.Uber told IBD on Monday that it was not commenting on the CEO search. GE did not respond to a request for comment.Shares of GE dipped 0.4% on the stock market today, posting a fresh 52-week low of 24.32 intraday, and Tesla dropped 3.6% to 335.00, negating its cup-with-handle base and 370.10 buy point.While Immelt has stepped down as CEO at GE, he remains chairman until the end of the year. John Flannery, a 30-year GE veteran, on Aug. 1 took over as the industrial giant's first new CEO in 16 years.During his tenure, Immelt deepened ties with Silicon Valley, divesting core businesses such as financial services while sharpening the tech focus across the industrial conglomerate's business lines.However, investors grew disenchanted with the overall strategy and slumbering stock, leading to the exit of the man widely credited with transforming the company.RELATED:Your Parents' Car Culture Is Nearly Dead: Here's Why

66,COO,"Talk about hot! Brian Demain is lead manager of $14.2 billion Janus Henderson Enterprise (JANEX), which is an IBD 2017 Best Mutual Fund Awards winner. So is the fund's twin, $1 billion Aspen Enterprise (JAAGX), of which he also is skipper.XThe portfolios won Best Funds honors by outperforming the S&P 500 in four time periods ended Dec. 31 — the trailing one, three, five and 10 years.And they did so in not just one category but in three — diversified equity mutual funds, growth mutual funds and midcap mutual funds.That put them into a small group of gems. A mere 44 U.S. diversified stock mutual funds, out of 1,104 with assets of at least $100 million, prevailed as winners across those four time spans.Demain and Cody Wheaton run the funds with little turnover, just 20% now, according to Morningstar Inc. Among both portfolios' holdings are Crown Castle (CCI), Microchip Technology (MCHP), Global Payments (GPN), Sensata Technologies (ST) and TD Ameritrade (AMTD). All are either forming basing patterns or in buy ranges.Enterprise is open to investors who already own shares. It's also open to old or new shareholders in 401(k) plans that already offer the fund, as well as to old or new investor clients of a wirehouse brokerage that offers the identical strategy through a separately managed account. Twin sister Aspen Enterprise can be bought by old or new investors through some insurance companies.A midcap fund at Janus Henderson that is still open to new investors is $4 billion Mid Cap Value (JMIVX).Demain, who is 40 years old, talked about his investment approach and several key stock holdings in a recent interview with IBD:IBD: Brian, summarize your investment approach.Demain: First, we look for what we call sustainable growth. We want companies that are growth companies today and will be three, five, seven years from now. They may not be the fastest growers, but they can grow for the long term.Second, we're looking for companies with sustainably high returns on invested capital. It's great if a company can grow. But if it's not earning high returns on invested capital, it's not increasing shareholder value. So we try to understand a company's competitive advantage, because that's what will drive its long-term return on invested capital.Third, we care about the quality of a company's management team. We like management teams that focus on the right areas, and that are good leaders.If we find companies that meet those three criteria and we can buy them at attractive valuations and hold them for the long term, we can outperform our peers.IBD: The fund's performance is consistent, as shown by its being an IBD Best Mutual Funds Awards winner. Is the key its outperformance during up markets or during down markets?Demain: We've generally been able to keep up in up markets and outperform in down markets. We try to have a predicted beta (a measurement of volatility relative to the market or benchmark) against our Russell MidCap Growth Index benchmark of between 0.85 and 1, so we have less absolute risk than the benchmark. But it's higher than 0.85, because we don't want to only outperform in a down market. That's where we want to shine, but we do OK in up markets as well.IBD: Why do you like midcaps?Demain: They're not as mature as large caps, so they have real growth opportunities ahead of them. But their business models are more established than small caps'.Many have withstood competitive challenges, which small caps may not have. But they tend to be less volatile than small caps.IBD: You've got about 70% of your assets in the technology, industrials and health care sectors. Why do you expect to find so many opportunities in those spaces?Demain: With tech and health care, it is the power of innovation. In tech, we've been overweight in hardware and semiconductors. The mobile internet is driving semiconductor growth. And we're seeing a lot of innovation in software pushing itself into our lives.In health, we own biotechs, pharmaceuticals, life-science tools and diagnostic companies. Aging baby boomers and an emerging middle class globally are driving innovations in drug development and diagnostics.IBD: You've noted that corporate tax cuts, infrastructure spending and deregulation may not occur as fast as many investors have hoped. How have you hedged your bets on those areas?Demain: Take tax cuts. Sensata is a Netherlands domiciled company (which makes sensors for aircraft, cars and other products) but it does business in the U.S. It pays a low tax rate because of where it is domiciled, so it will not benefit from lower U.S. rates.We also own TD Ameritrade (which is a brokerage). It pays a full tax rate, so if there's reform it will benefit. But policy changes can cut both ways. Ameritrade also benefits from rising interest rates. It sweeps clients' cash balances into TD Bank and earns more money on that spread as rates rise. And we own Crown Castle (a REIT that owns wireless cell towers). It has high levels of borrowing, so it will be hurt by high interest rates.IBD: Lam Research (LRCX) must be one of your semiconductor plays. Describe it, please.Demain: They are a semiconductor capital equipment manufacturer. In the last few years, we've gone from everything being etched on one plane of each microchip to effectively stacked layers on chips. So a lot of growth has gone to etching deposition players like Lam.In addition, demand in the memory market is robust. That's driven by uptake in solid-state drives. We're going from the old disk drives to solid-state flash-driven drives. That demands lots of chips, which is good for Lam.And we like their valuation. The stock trades at 13.5 times forward earnings. If you back out their cash, it is close to 12 times. The market's multiple is north of 18 times. And several high quality semiconductor companies are trading at 20 times.IBD: Celgene (CELG) is best known for Revlimid, its blood-cancer treatment. Do you like its other products?Demain: You're right, Revlimid is its workhorse and continues to grow due to longer treatment duration and finding new patients. But what do they do after Revlimid goes off-patent in 2026?The outlook for three other Celgene products — Pomalyst, Otezla and Abraxane — is constructive. And we're excited about its pipeline of new (treatments). Also, they've done business development deals with cash from Revlimid to build emerging franchises in gastroenterology and immunology, and inflammation and immunology. Those things should make the 2026 patent cliff for Revlimid a manageable event.IBD'S TAKE: Celgene is the No. 1 ranked stock in IBD's Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group, which is ranked a very strong No. 4 among 197 groups. Celgene earns its top-dog status thanks to such traits as a best-possible 99 Composite Rating from IBD and an annual pretax margin of 50.4, which is the highest it's been in at least nine years. Compare its other technical and fundamental strengths to its rivals' at IBD's easy-to-use Stock Checkup tool.IBD: Microchip Technology's earnings per share growth has accelerated for six quarters in a row. Does your thesis revolve around the fact that their chips are used in a variety of products?Demain: The majority of their revenue is from microcontrollers, which are very simple computers that can go into all sorts of devices from airplanes to microwave ovens to kids' toys. That has great growth dynamics, which is a function of the growth of the Internet of Things. That's the company's sustainable growth.That business has a very fragmented customer base. You're not just selling a ton of chips to one customer like Apple (AAPL). You're selling to thousands of end markets. That's their competitive advantage.As for a good management team, the company is led by Steve Sanghi. We have high regard for his value creation. The company recently acquired Atmel, which was a large microcontroller competitor. It had good assets, but was poorly managed. Sanghi has improved operating margins and driven strong earnings growth. And valuation is not that demanding at about 15 times forward earnings.IBD: How does SS&C Technologies (SSNC) illustrate your investment approach?Demain: This is another example of sustainable growth plus competitive advantage plus strong management. SS&C provides back-office services for financial companies. As asset management matures, more companies want to focus on their core competencies. Rather than run back offices in-house, they look to outsource. And once they are embedded with a customer, other departments at the customer may outsource to them as well.SS&C is run by Bill Stone, who has a proven record of value creation. And their valuation is reasonable.IBD: Global Payments' earnings per share growth has sped up. Why?Demain: Think of Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA) as electronic payment highways. Global Payments is the on- and offramp. They have relationships with merchants who accept credit card terminals. If you run a restaurant, for example, Global gives you software that not only accepts credit cards but also helps you run your restaurant. And Global has benefited from consolidation.IBD: What makes Heico (HEIA), which designs and repairs parts for aircraft and engines, attractive to you?Demain: Only certain approved suppliers can sell parts to airlines. Planes are in service for 25, 30 years, and need servicing. But only a relatively small number of companies have parts-manufacturing approval (PMA) from the Federal Aviation Administration and the European (regulatory) body. The FAA has (limited resources) and can only approve so many parts per year. Heico has the best position in the PMA market. They earn healthy margins.Also, the Mendelson family owns a large percentage of the company. It's most of their liquid net worth, so they care a lot about creating shareholder value, so we like to partner with them.IBD: What's driven the share-price uptrend by contact-lens developer Cooper (COO)?Demain: We like their sustainable growth. Contact lens are a growing category as contacts get more comfortable. They also benefit from international growth.There are only four players: Bausch & Lomb, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Alcon and Cooper. Once a consumer picks one, they usually stick with it and won't change because of a small price difference.IBD: Why is index operator MSCI attractive?Demain: The way to think about them is that they benefit from the growth of ETFs. An active manager like Janus Henderson pays a fixed fee for access to a benchmark operator. For MSCI, when a fee dollar moves from an active to a passive fund, that dollar becomes more profitable.And once you are a standard index, it is hard (for users) to change.IBD: By the way, any plans to reopen Enterprise Fund to all investors?Demain: No, we are managing $18 billion (including money in Aspen Enterprise and in separately managed accounts using Enterprise's strategy). It makes us one of the larger midcap strategies. Our first priority is working on behalf of existing clients. They think being closed is in their best interests and that's why we've done this.RELATED:Winning Mutual Fund Focuses On Leading Stocks Like Autohome, MarketAxess7 Steps For Millennials Who Want To Become Rich Retirees

67,COO,"Setting ambitious but realistic goals for your team always requires care. But managing millennials — born in the 1980s and 1990s — might require a fresh approach.To devise goals that might hold particular appeal to younger employees:Establish a two-way process. Traditional bosses declare a goal and then expect staffers to work hard to attain it. That approach might not be as effective with millennials.""You want to be a transformational leader, not a transactional one,"" said Jesse Calloway, a leadership consultant in Chesterfield, Va. That means turning young employees into participants who help shape their own performance goals, as opposed to setting a high bar and threatening to punish them if they fail to meet your standard.Stay involved. It may not be enough to explain a goal and then walk away. Millennials are perceived by some as craving coaching and interaction.Author of ""All the Way to the Top,"" Calloway suggests that you set up checkpoints to meet with millennials to gauge their progress as they march toward a goal.""It's important to follow up so they know you want to coach them along the way,"" he said. ""So say, 'We'll get together next week to check in.' And when you do check in, celebrate the small, successful steps"" that the individual has achieved.Think sooner, not later. Regardless of the age of your team members, set goals that motivate them to excel. But be aware that millennials might be more inclined to push themselves harder if they face a tight time frame.""They grew up in an instant-gratification culture,"" said Rachel Ernst, director of employee success at Reflektive, a San Francisco-based firm that makes performance-management software. ""They tend to have less patience and want goals that they can attain over the short term, say eight to 12 weeks instead of one year.""Emphasize professional development. Goals might resonate more forcefully with millennials if they are tied to advancement opportunities. Young staffers may want reassurance that if they meet or exceed the objectives you've set, they will reap career rewards.""After six to nine months in a role, they want to know what's new,"" said Ernst, who manages many millennials. ""So I'll say to them, 'Here's how these goals will help you enter a new role or function.' ""Focus on outcome, not process. Even if you encourage millennials to craft their own goals, you might still need to refine how they think about their contribution to the organization's success. Left on their own, they might confuse process with outcome.Say a young go-getter proposes making 100 sales calls a week. Rather than just nod approvingly, translate those calls into broader, more impactful goals.""When I let millennials take a first shot at drafting their goals, they often start with process goals,"" Ernst said. ""Their mindset is more task-oriented: I have to make these calls, do these things, etc. Then I ask questions so they think more deeply about outcome goals"" that strengthen the company.For example, Ernst might redirect a millennial from narrowly concentrating on certain tasks by asking, ""If you think about your role more broadly, what can you do to build community and impact our organization as a whole?""Embrace transparency. Because they likely were raised in a sea of social media, millennials are probably accustomed to open, unfiltered online sharing. They may respond well to collaborative leaders who combine goal-setting with personal disclosure and information-sharing.For instance, in her book ""Option B,"" co-written with Adam Grant, Facebook (FB) COO Sheryl Sandberg notes that Facebook executive Carolyn Everson shares her own performance reviews with 2,400 employees — many of whom are millennials.Why?Writes Sandberg: ""She wants her entire team to see how she's working to improve.""MORE SECRETS TO SUCCESS:8 Rules For Leading From Your Moral Center — And Boosting Morale6 Ways To Inspire Employees' Loyalty5 Lessons That Disrupters Like Facebook Teach About Succeeding Now9 Ways To Stay On Track And Reach Your Goals

But anacetrapid built up in fat tissue and, unlike similar studies, Merck didn't test the effect of anacetrapid on reducing the risk of strokes. Esperion Therapeutics (ESPR) stock, though, broke out Wednesday after it announced a trial combining its bempedoic acid with anacetrapid to lower ""bad' cholesterol.KB Home (KBH) Q2 results beat analysts expectations with earnings up 94% to 33 cents and revenue up 24% to $1 billion. Deliveries rose 11% to 2,580 homes and the average selling price increased 11% to $385,900. Backlog value rose 19% to $2.18 billion, on an 8% increase in volume to 5,612 homes. Adjusted homebuilding operating margin widened 90 basis points to 5.6%. KB Home soared 7% to a 4-year high. MDC Holdings (MDC) broke out following KB Home's results, but the builder pulled back amid the broad market sell-off and higher interest rates.Facebook (FB) has topped 2 billion monthly active users, doubling its base in a little more than 4-1/2 years.General Motors (GM) now sees U.S. industrywide sales in the low 17-million range this year, down from its prior estimate that demand would be about equal to last year's record 17.55 million. Meanwhile, other signs point to softening demand for high-margin SUVs.Store Capital (STOR) announced a $377 million investment from a Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) unit Monday, equal to a 9.8% stake.

71,COO,"Like a pro athlete, Nike (NKE) knows that it needs to tweak its strategy from time to time to stay competitive.XOn its fourth-quarter earnings call on Thursday, Wall Street will likely be looking for more commentary on the athletic footwear and apparel maker's new consumer-focused initiatives intended to keep it in sync with a digitally driven retail environment and ahead of rivals Adidas (ADDYY) and Under Armour (UAA). Nike's recent sales arrangement with Amazon (AMZN)? Expect questions about that too.For the quarter, Wall Street expects flat year-over-year per-share earnings of 49 cents on 4.5% revenue growth to $8.61 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research. That would mark a second flat Q4 for EPS and a slight slowdown in sales growth.The results will come roughly two weeks after Nike announced a new ""consumer direct offense"" alignment. That effort reorganizes Nike's leadership and geographic structure and tightens its focus on a dozen key cities across the world that are expected to account for 80% of its projected growth through 2020.Part of Nike's new game plan also involves what it calls a ""triple double"" goal to double innovation, speed to market and direct engagement with customers. The plan also includes laying off 2% of its global workforce. Nike shares fell more than 3% on June 15, the day of the news.Nike and other major athletic apparel and footwear brands are all developing manufacturing and supply-chain technologies to get on-trend products on shelves faster. Under Armour this week also announced a leadership shuffle of its own, reviving its COO position.The sluggish retail environment has raised questions about how and where individual brands will sell their products, as brick-and-mortar stores like Macy's (M) and J.C. Penney (JCP) struggle to shore up store traffic amid competition from Amazon and off-price chains.Nike will reportedly sell footwear directly on Amazon in an attempt to combat the sale of knockoff goods at the e-commerce giant. That could spell trouble for J.C. Penney and Kohl's (KSS), Gordon Haskett analyst Charles Grom said last week.Shares of Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) and Foot Locker (FL) immediately took a hit on news of a possible Nike-Amazon team-up — perhaps not without reason. Nike, Adidas, Hanesbrands (HBI)-owned Hanes and Under Armour are the most frequently bought brands on Amazon, Morgan Stanley said in April.As Nike dials down the emphasis on its self-created ""futures orders"" — a metric designed to reflect retailer demand — it is dialing up its own in-house manufacturing and selling capabilities, with aims to halve its product-creation cycle and streamline its brick-and-mortar and online retail experiences.Still, Cowen this month trimmed its price target on Nike to 53 from 54 on increased promotional activity amid its rivalry with Adidas and Under Armour, and JPMorgan downgraded the stock to neutral from overweight.Morgan Stanley analyst Jay Sole said earlier this month that the market is expecting Nike to guide fiscal 2018 profit below consensus for $2.52 per share — Zacks currently puts consensus at $2.44 — but that those expectations have already been priced into the stock. He has an equal-weight rating on the stock.Given ""poor"" sentiment and high short interest in Nike, Sole sees bulls snapping up shares of the athletic brand after the market digests the company's full-year guidance on Thursday.Nike shares closed up 0.8% at 53.36 on the stock market today, hitting resistance on the underside of their converging 50-day and 200-day lines. The stock is up less than 5% so far in calendar 2017, underperforming the S&P 500. Under Armour reversed lower to finish down 0.6%, and Amazon added 1.4%.RELATED:Under Armour Names New COO, Announces ReorganizationHere's The Latest Group Having An Amazon-Induced Anxiety AttackNike To Shrink Workforce As Stores Seen 'Canceling' Under ArmourNike, Adidas Have This 'Major Roadblock' Against Amazon

72,COO,"Travis Kalanick has resigned from his job leading privately held Uber Technologies, giving up on his effort to hold onto power as a torrent of self-inflicted scandals enveloped him and the global ride-hailing leviathan he co-founded.Pressure from investors, who've poured more than $15 billion into a company that has burned through billions, ultimately did what the board could, or would, not: It convinced the 40-year-old chief executive to step aside. Five of Uber's major investors, including Fidelity and Benchmark, asked Kalanick to step aside in a letter to him entitled ""Moving Uber Forward,"" according to people familiar with the matter.Kalanick, who grew Uber's bookings to $20 billion last year, has played a starring role in most of its controversies.He called the company ""Boob-er."" He argued with a driver about pay in a video published by Bloomberg. He's said to have questioned whether a female passenger had been raped by a driver who was convicted of the crime in India.Kalanick co-authored corporate values that included ""Let Builders Build,"" ""Always Be Hustlin',"" ""Meritocracy and Toe-Stepping,"" and ""Principled Confrontation."" Uber now plans to scrap many of those tenets on the advice of former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, who just concluded an investigation into the cultural failings of a company built in Kalanick's image.""I love Uber more than anything in the world and at this difficult moment in my personal life I have accepted the investors' request to step aside so that Uber can go back to building rather than be distracted with another fight,"" Kalanick said in a statement. He will remain on the board of directors, Uber said separately.The campaign to convince Kalanick to step aside couldn't have come at a more painful time in his life. His mother died in a freak boating accident in May that severely injured his father. Benchmark partner Bill Gurley tweeted: ""There will be many pages in the history books devoted to @travisk — very few entrepreneurs have had such a lasting impact on the world."" Representatives for Fidelity and Benchmark didn't immediately respond to emailed requests for comment.Kalanick began an indefinite leave of absence on June 13 and left the day-to-day management of the company to a committee of 14 top executives. Regional operations heads continue to oversee much of the company's business.Uber has been searching for a chief operating officer. With Kalanick's departure, the company is now also looking for a chief executive officer — a far more desirable position for a business leader. Whoever takes the helm will have to plug a leadership vacuum. Uber needs to hire a COO, an independent board chair, a chief marketing officer, and a general counsel. Many of the company's top executives were promoted internally after their bosses left, including heads of business, policy and communications, and product.Kalanick's closest confidant, Emil Michael, was ousted by Uber's board following Holder's recommendations. Like Kalanick, he was tied to the mishandling of an Indian rape case and attended an outing to a karaoke bar in South Korea that triggered a human resources complaint.This month, the company shared the recommendations of Holder's law firm. More than 20 people were fired as part of a separate probe by another firm into sexual harassment, discrimination, retaliation, and other personnel complaints.Despite recent turmoil, Uber's business is growing. Revenue increased to $3.4 billion in the first quarter, while losses narrowed — though they remain substantial at $708 million.Kalanick remains a paper billionaire given his approximately 12% stake in the company, with a net worth of $6.7 billion, according to calculations by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Uber itself has been valued at $69 billion.It's unclear if Kalanick is eligible for severance or other post-employment benefits. Since Uber is privately held, the terms of his employment aren't known. But public company executives who depart of their own free will typically walk away with nothing. And many tech businesses, including Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN), employ executives at will and don't offer special payouts in case of a termination or if the company is bought.Uber has sought to head off a defection of drivers by adding a function to its app that lets customers provide tips, a feature offered by U.S. rival Lyft Inc. Kalanick was against letting riders tip, calling his opposition ""principled"" since he believed restaurants and taxi companies use tips to underpay their workers. Now, in Kalanick's absence, the company is trying to take a new tack.In a statement about Kalanick's resignation, Uber's board of directors said: ""This is a bold decision and a sign of his devotion and love for Uber. By stepping away, he's taking the time to heal from his personal tragedy while giving the company room to fully embrace this new chapter in Uber's history.""

73,COO,"Boeing's (BA) European rival Airbus (EADSY) expects plane deliveries to outstrip new bookings in 2017 for the first time in years and reported sharply slumping orders so far this year, with demand for the widebody aircraft that are key profit drivers cut almost in half.Airbus has booked only 73 net orders in the first five months of 2017, down 55% from the year-ago period, COO Fabrice Bregie told reporters in Toulouse, France. Widebody A330 and A350 jetliners saw 30 net bookings, down 46% from the year-ago period.While the vast majority of passenger jets sold are single-aisle planes, widebody or twin-aisle aircraft carry bigger margins for Airbus and Boeing as they typically fly lucrative long-haul international routes. Demand for these jets has slumped since early 2015, forcing some analysts to warn that production cuts may be needed.American Airlines (AAL), Delta Air Lines (DAL) and other airlines have either put off big plane orders to slow spending or are reviewing orders.U.S.-listed shares of Airbus rallied 1.3% to 20.96 on the stock market today. Shares of Dow component Boeing rose 10 cents to 190.03, still within buying range.Boeing got a lift Friday after the U.S. International Trade Commission ruled in favor of the U.S. aerospace giant, which accused Bombardier of selling its C Series jets at less than fair value in the U.S. The ITC said there is a reasonable indication Boeing has been hurt but must issue a final ruling before any duties can be imposed.Airbus forecasts world’s passenger aircraft fleet to double in the next 20 years with 35,000 new aircraft needed https://t.co/QtKJtHoMvw pic.twitter.com/d3xrRmKTCQ— Airbus (@Airbus) June 9, 2017Airbus also modestly lowered its outlook for air traffic growth: 4.4% in the 20 years through 2036 instead of the 4.5% in the two decades through 2035 it offered a year ago.Still, the company remained upbeat, noting ""increasing numbers of first-time flyers, rising disposable income spent on air travel, expanding tourism, industry liberalization, new routes and evolving airline business models"" as factors driving growth.Airbus hiked its forecast for industrywide sales over the next 20 years, predicting nearly 35,000 passenger and freight aircraft valued at $5.3 trillion through 2036. That is 1,829 more planes than a previous forecast.Emerging markets will be a key driver of that growth, said John Leahy, chief operating officer at Airbus.""Asia-Pacific continues to be an engine for growth, with domestic China to become the world's largest market,"" he said in a press note.

76,COO,"Watching a movie in 10-second snippets over the course of five days might sound maddening.But the 110 million cumulative views on Snapchat for teen thriller ""Sickhouse"" say otherwise. The numbers reinforce views that an audience exists for narrative content on nontraditional sites. And they suggest entertainment industry competition will continue to ratchet higher, with social media competing directly with television and streaming platforms for viewers.XWriters are poised to go on strike as they duke it out with studios over the sweeping changes to the industry wrought by Netflix (NFLX), Hulu and Amazon (AMZN) Video. But the next frontier already is at the door, thanks to moves by Snap's (SNAP) Snapchat and perhaps, soon enough, Facebook (FB).For now, traditional Hollywood studios are eager to team up with streaming video newcomers in a bid for coveted Gen Z and millennial viewers.""The team at Snap is thinking about mobile TV differently than anyone else in this space,"" said Barry Poznick, president of Unscripted Television MGM, in a March announcement on a partnership between MGM Television and Snap.The shared goal is to develop and produce ""TV-like mobile video content"" for Snapchat's Discover feature. ""We are excited to create content for their vast and hard-to-reach audience that consumes entertainment in a very specific fashion,"" Poznick added.The uniquely formatted ""Sickhouse"" — essentially ""Blair Witch Project"" for the internet age — was shot on just two Apple (AAPL) iPhones and rolled out in nearly 500 successive Snaps last year through the account of popular Snapchatter Andrea Russett. It wasn't a production backed by Snap, but has been billed broadly as the messaging app's first full-length movie.Indigenous Media produced the project and has since repackaged it in a standard format. COO Jake Avnet is more than pleased with the release of the full version of ""Sickhouse,"" which has been fleshed out to 68 minutes. A sequel is in the works.He won't say how much the first film has made so far, but it has ""performed well on virtually every platform (on which) it's been made available."" The film is available on AT&T (T)-backed Fullscreen and can be purchased for $5.99 on iTunes, Vimeo and Amazon Video.""We've been happy to see there's been a very healthy, sort of, second life to the film beyond that first Snapchat window,"" he said.The indie flick was no doubt unconventional in production, format and distribution. But as Twitter bloomed with discussion over whether Andrea Russett's increasingly creepy Snapchat activity was real or staged, the five-day social media debate perhaps indicates that young people's attention spans aren't gnatlike after at all, if the content is juicy enough to follow.""Sickhouse"" director Hannah Macpherson should know. She also writes and directs ""[email protected],"" an AwesomenessTV-produced series available through Verizon Communications' (VZ) Go90 app. A ""modern-day thriller that explores the terrifying risks of social media in a world of anonymity,"" the show's second season is about to begin.""That's a show that streams on teenagers' phones,"" she told Investor's Business Daily. ""So I'm very familiar that that's how teenagers are watching a lot of content. They're not watching just two-minute YouTube clips. They're watching 10 hours of 'House of Cards' on their cellphones.""Not surprisingly, traditional entertainment giants like Disney (DIS) and Viacom (VIAB) see an opportunity. Comcast (CMCSA) unit NBCUniversal even invested $500 million in Snap's initial public offering.As they scramble to be where younger eyeballs are, they've put their content on Snapchat, which features videos from ESPN, Comedy Central and the Wall Street Journal. Offerings also include ABC's ""Watch Party: The Bachelor,"" BBC's ""Planet Earth II"" and original shorts from NBC's ""Saturday Night Live.""Snap's fresh slate of programming has a decidedly ""Real World""-era MTV feel to it. There's A&E's ""Second Chance"" (exes meet to dissect their broken relationships) and the soon-to-debut Vice Media's ""Hungry Hearts with Action Bronson"" (the rapper/chef plays matchmaker).Then there's Snap's in-house production, ""Good Luck America,"" which is in its second season and attempts to make politics accessible for its viewers, Rock the Vote-style.Other social media heavyweights have their own plans in motion. Twitter (TWTR), for its part, has so far kept its video focus on sports and news. On top of partnerships with CBS (CBS) News, Bloomberg, Major League Baseball, the National Basketball Association and others, the company intends to stream 1,500 hours of e-sports on the platform this year.Facebook's TV guide is fuzzier, as the social networking giant builds out a video hub for all kinds of viewable content.It has begun funding ""seed video content"" that includes ""original and licensed scripted, unscripted and sports content that takes advantage of mobile and the social interaction unique to Facebook,"" the company's head of global creative strategy, Ricky Van Veen, told Recode in December.No specific show announcements have been made, but the Silicon Valley giant sounds like it's headed to Hollywood.In February, reports surfaced that Facebook had poached MTV's head of scripted development to become its head of development for original programming. Not long after that, Wall Street Journal sources said the company was looking for up-to-30-minute ""TV-like"" originals that focus on science, pop culture, sports and more — a far cry from the site's typical user-generated Facebook Live videos or short viral clips. Recent Facebook job listings also point to its desire to develop media and entertainment liaisons in Los Angeles.Long term, whether studios and networks benefit from partnering with social media outlets ""remains to be seen,"" said Morningstar tech analyst Ali Mogharabi.In Snapchat's case, content created for its nonstandard portrait-mode style renders it unusable on TV or even other online counterparts.""I think in the short to medium term, some of those (companies) will realize that this may not have been a worthy investment,"" he said.But it might also be a necessary evil, given the sway Snapchat, Facebook and Twitter have, and the chance that they could lure more talent away from the entertainment industry. Sony Entertainment CEO Michael Lynton, an early Snap investor, announced in January that he would step down from the media conglomerate to focus on being Snap's chairman full-time.""Facebook's got a lot of money and a lot of pulse on the core millennial class,"" Magid Advisors President Mike Vorhaus told Investor's Business Daily. ""Snapchat's cool and edgy and all video all the time, and it's got a special kind of brand that you could've compared to brands like MTV 30, 40 years ago. So people are going to take a call from Snapchat, right? Joss Whedon gets a phone call (from) Snapchat — he's gonna take that.""For social media networks, whose users generate a seemingly endless stream of free video content every day, there's the inevitable question of risk. Why take on the unwieldy task of funding and creating original programming? Everyone knows entertainment is a hit-or-miss industry, so why not beef up those video libraries by licensing other people's shows?""We think (Facebook is) basically trying to expand its ecosystem, which they're hoping (will) keep users in the net ecosystem for a longer time,"" Morningstar's Mogharabi said. ""If they're successful at doing that, then they could attract some more ad dollars.""Snap, on the other hand, is ""pretty much doing the same thing for different reasons,"" he said. ""These guys actually need to build user base to begin with.""At this early stage, Mogharabi doesn't see Netflix-style ambitions in Snap's and Facebook's futures. But assuming that user growth and engagement follow, he says, Snap will be looking to rake in advertisers' money.A recent episode of E!'s ""The Rundown,"" which totaled fewer than 20 Snaps, included three ads for ""Fast and the Furious"" sequel ""The Fate of the Furious,"" which was slated to come out in theaters later that week.That could present a worry to entertainment executives courting advertising sales.Twitter recently announced plans to present for the first time at the Digital Content Newfronts in May. (The ""newfronts"" are an online-media counterpart to traditional upfronts, where media buyers make their ad-space purchases.) Without divulging much else, the company said it ""will showcase new original content offerings and live programming to brands and agencies entering the 2017 upfront season.""And last fall, eMarketer estimated that digital ad spending for 2016 would overtake TV ad spending for the first time. Its projections show a widening gap between digital and TV ad spending as the years go on.It's worth keeping in mind, however, that digital advertising growth ""hasn't necessarily come at a cost to TV ad budget,"" said Morningstar's Mogharabi.""TV ad dollars are still growing, of course at a much slower rate, but that's been the case for a while,"" he said. ""It's not necessarily that every percentage growth that you see in digital ad dollars is actually coming from television.  ...  It's not a so-called binary case.""That may give Hollywood — with its legacy entourage of agents, producers, directors and development execs — some comfort.And yet, while the big media companies aren't likely to quake in the face of Mark Zuckerberg's video tab or a few Venice Beach young guns with an app, they know better than to brush off competition from peculiar places.After all, with Amazon Studios' lauded ""Manchester by the Sea,"" the same e-commerce company that sells Echos, diapers and books online now carries the sheen of the Academy Awards. (The film, which was nominated for Best Picture, landed a statuette for Original Screenplay; star Casey Affleck notched a win in the lead-actor category.)""I think (network execs) kind of get it in a way that they might not have gotten it four years ago or six years ago, depending on who you were talking about,"" Vorhaus said.""So it's not, like, all of a sudden they're going to go, 'Oh my God, Snap and Facebook, they're surprising us just like — you know, some of us would admit — Netflix surprised us.' So I don't think the surprise is big. I think they get the frenemy concept.""

77,COO,"The search for a new top Mouseketeer is still fruitless, apparently, given Walt Disney's (DIS) announcement Thursday that it is extending the contract of Chairman and CEO Bob Iger to July 2, 2019.He had been scheduled to leave on June 30, 2018, but this isn't the first time that Iger has pushed back his retirement date, having already extended his contract twice before. If and when he steps down in 2019, it will be four years past his original planned date to leave the House of Mouse.Thursday's decision comes despite earlier statements that he would not stay on, but Iger then relented, telling those on Disney's February earnings call that he would be ""open to"" prolonging his tenure if it was in the best interest of the company. Inside sources had also told the Wall Street Journal last month that they expected Iger to stay on to train his replacement.""(I)t is obvious that the company and its shareholders will be best served by his continued leadership as the board conducts the robust process of identifying a successor and ensuring a smooth transition,"" said Orin Smith, the independent lead director of the Disney board, in a statement.The succession plan had once looked less murky. Then-COO Tom Staggs was next in line to be CEO, but he left last April amid reports that Iger and the board were throwing open the doors to other potential successors.Walt Disney shares closed up 0.1% at 112.24 on the stock market today, back above a 112.09 buy point after bobbing around that threshold since an initial breakout last week. Disney hit a session high of 112.98.Iger's annual salary will remain unchanged, according to the 8-K Disney filed on Wednesday, and he is set to receive a $5 million cash bonus should he stay until his new 2019 end-date. After that, he will stay on as a consultant to the company for three years, said the filing.RELATED:Bob Iger 'Open To' Remaining Disney CEO, Sees Online Sports Service In 2017

78,COO,"Analysts continued to post dim views of Twitter (TWTR) following the microblog disappointing Q4 earnings and guidance issued early Thursday, and Twitter shares continued to tumble.Twitter is struggling to expand beyond its power user base — its profile has been boosted by power-user President Trump — and faces increased competition for eyeballs and ad dollars from Facebook (FB), Google-owner Alphabet (GOOGL), Snapchat and others. Snapchat parent Snap, a messaging and multimedia mobile application, last week filed for an initial public offering that is expected to be the largest IPO since the debut of Facebook in 2012.Twitter reported mixed Q4 results and gave weak current-quarter guidance. Though it beat on the bottom line revenue rose just 1% to $717.2 million, far below analyst estimates of $740 million. It marked the 10th quarter in a row of revenue deceleration, year over year. Ad revenue of $638 million actually fell from $641 million in Q4 2015.Twitter stock was down nearly 5% near 15.50 in late-afternoon trading in the stock market today, after falling 12% Thursday and falling below its 50-day and 200-day lines. Shares now trade at an eight-month low.IBD'S TAKE: Investors should focus on leading stocks, not laggards, even if the latter are ""cheap."" For a look at some top-performing stocks, check out IBD 50.FBN Securities analyst Shebly Seyrafi lowered his price target on Twitter to 18 from 19, but he maintained an outperform rating, saying in a research note that Twitter has $3 a share in net cash, is controlling costs and might become an acquisition target.Twitter, though not officially up for sale, has reportedly been looked over by several tech companies, including Salesforce.com (CRM) Walt Disney (DIS) and Alphabet. All reportedly decided against pursuing a Twitter deal, in part because of the social network's problems with abusive posts and comments.Seyrafi said the reason Twitter's outlook is so challenging includes competition coming from Facebook and Snapchat. He said the Facebook Live product ""really hurt Twitter's Periscope and previous Vine products."" Also causing Twitter headaches is Facebook Instagram, the photo and video sharing site.Another challenge facing the company, Seyrafi wrote, is that Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey is managing two different companies. Dorsey is also CEO of online payments company Square (SQ).""As much respect as we have for Jack Dorsey as a technology visionary, having one person managing two different companies is a nearly impossible task,"" he wrote.A third reason is management turnover.

79,COO,"Yum Brands (YUM), the parent of KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut, reported fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday.Estimates: EPS was expected to rise 9% to 74 cents. Revenue was seen to sinking 47% to $2.09 billion, reflecting the absence of recently spun-off Yum China (YUMC).Results: EPS excluding various items rose to 79 cents. Revenue was $2.02 billion, a 2% gain based on continuing operations. Same-store sales rose just 1% vs. forecasts for about 2%. Taco Bell and KFC comps grew 3%, but Pizza Hut comps slid 2%.Yum CEO Greg Creed said that Pizza Hut's results were ""disappointing and not acceptable,"" adding that Yum is bringing in outside experts to study the brand.Stock: Shares rose 1.2% to 67.39 on the stock market today, after inching into buy range on Tuesday in weaker-than-average volume. The entry point is 66.36.Now that Yum Brands has offloaded its China business, Taco Bell could draw more of Wall Street's attention, Cowen & Co. noted recently.Cowen recently called the taco chain ""the crown jewel of Yum's portfolio"" that balanced ""tactical value with menu innovation to navigate a challenging quick-service backdrop.""Throughout last year, restaurants' financial results got hit by competitive discounting, bad weather, election-related anxieties and lower prices at grocery stores. Some chains also saw sales slow at the end of December, possibly because fewer people went out shopping during the holidays, Cowen said.Pizza Hut, meanwhile, has struggled to compete with the likes of Domino's Pizza (DPZ).IBD'S TAKE: The fast-food and tech worlds are colliding.

81,COO,"Will Bob Iger stay on as chief executive of Walt Disney (DIS)? Maybe, if he has to.When pressed about his succession plans on the Walt Disney's earnings call late Tuesday, Iger said that if prolonging his stay at the House of Mouse was in the best interest of the company, then he was ""open to"" that, but he also made clear that there was nothing to announce. His current contract expires in June 2018.The comments came on the heels of a Wall Street Journal report Monday in which Disney insiders said they expected Iger to stay on amid an ongoing search for his replacement. Then-COO Thomas Staggs stepped down in 2016; the board reportedly was not certain that he was the right fit for the top spot.For the quarter, Disney logged a surprise year-over-year decline in revenue, with a 3% drop to $14.78 billion, short of estimates for an uptick to $15.26 billion. But adjusted EPS fell a less-than-expected 5% to $1.55, beating views by a nickel.Shares are down fractionally after closing down 0.5% to 109 in the stock market today, ending the session still in buy range after breaking out of a saucer-with-handle base with 106.36 entry at the start of the year.Media networks, the segment that houses ESPN, saw revenue slip 2% to $6.2 billion. Iger reaffirmed bullishness about the premium sports cable network, highlighting deals with new streaming platforms that have produced some ""nice gains"" in subscriptions. He added that those subscriptions aren't fully counted by Nielsen.He also called out streaming media service BAMTech, of which Disney owns a one-third stake, and said that he expects to launch a direct-to-consumer sports streaming service in calendar year 2017.""The quality of that technology has just blown us away,"" said Iger.Iger announced last August plans to introduce an ESPN-branded over-the-top service, though it would be one that provides ""complementary"" programming that ESPN has licensed but isn't airing.In Q1, ESPN's subscriptions declined, and the network logged a decrease overall ""due to higher programming costs and lower advertising revenue, partially offset by affiliate revenue growth.""Despite the success of ""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,"" the studio arm faced understandably tough comparisons to the prior-year quarter's ""The Force Awakens,"" although ""Doctor Strange"" and ""Moana"" box office sales helped to offset a decrease in theatrical distribution revenue.Overall, studio revenue fell 7% to $2.5 billion.Meanwhile., consumer products revenue tumbled 23% from last year's Q1, during which ""Star Wars"" and ""Frozen"" merchandise sales provided tough year-over-year comparisons.Disney's theme parks and resorts unit was the only segment to log a year-over-year increase during the quarter, with 6% growth to $4.6 billion.RELATED:What To Expect From Disney Earnings; Will Iger Stay On As CEO?

83,COO,"Walt Disney (DIS) discloses first-quarter results after the close Tuesday, and while all the usual components are in play — the studio arm will likely be lauded, ESPN subscriptions will face analyst scrutiny — a new report indicates that CEO Bob Iger may not be able to retire next year, as he originally planned.Disney insiders believe that Iger, whose contract ends in June 2018, will have to stay on to train his successor, according to a Wall Street Journal story, as the media conglomerate remains silent on who might head one of the most well-known entertainment brands in the world.The ascension pipeline has been looking murky since Thomas Staggs stepped down as COO last spring. He reportedly did so amid doubts from the board that he was the right man for the job.During Disney's last earnings call, Iger was mum on the details, except to say that ""the process is ongoing, it's robust, and we're all confident that it's going to result in the board choosing not only the right candidate, but the right candidate on a timely basis.""Expect a similar question Tuesday.For fiscal Q1, Disney is projected to notch an 8% per-share earnings decline to $1.50 on a 0.1% revenue uptick to $15.26 billion.While ""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story"" was a blockbuster for the studio arm, it faces tough comparisons to 2015's ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens."" A ""Star Wars"" movie every year for the next several years means that the Force will likely be strong with Disney's movie segment.But BMO Capital Markets analyst Daniel Salmon a few weeks ago downgraded the stock's rating to underperform, noting that he sees ""more negative data points than positive for ESPN"" and believes that ""consensus Studio estimates embed better performance per film, which is a key risk, in our opinion.""Investors appear to have largely recovered from their hand-wringing over ESPN subscriber numbers, first triggered in August 2015, when Iger noted modest losses. The frown lines in the stock have largely been smoothed over, with shares still in buy range after breaking out of a saucer-with-handle base with 106.36 entry at the start of the year.Shares were down 0.75% at 109.47 in afternoon trading on the stock market today.Salmon believes Disney's stock is more likely to test the 90-ish end of its trading range than the 120s, as bullishness about the studio's film slate might already be ""overdone."" He noted in October that he sees ESPN subscriber losses accelerating, with streaming skinny-bundle subscriptions only partially offsetting those declines.But Piper Jaffray's Stan Meyers raised his price target to 130 from 115 late last month, with an overweight rating, citing the strength of Disney's studio, consumer products and theme parks segments.He said that he expects consumer products to ""become the company's most profitable segment"" in fiscal 2017, helped by the film slate at Disney, which owns Lucasfilm, Marvel and Pixar.Notably, Hasbro's (HAS) strong earnings, which sent shares up 14% Monday, come on the back of Disney princess and ""Frozen"" toy sales.

Lu stepped down late last year, citing medical issues from a bicycle accident months earlier.

85,COO,"Cloud platform vendor VMware (VMW) saw its shares climb to a 17-month high Friday, after the company late Thursday posted Q4 earnings that comfortably beat on the top and bottom lines — boosted by a product that won't come out until at least the summer.VMware, majority owned by Dell, in October announced a partnership with Amazon.com's (AMZN) Amazon Web Services, the No. 1 provider of cloud services infrastructure. VMware On AWS is slated for release later this year, but the anticipation of its release is already helping, says VMware executives and analysts alike.The AWS partnership ""assures customers we will remain leaders"" in the shift to the public cloud, VMware COO Sanjay Poonen told IBD in a phone interview Friday.In the public cloud, companies and enterprises are putting most of their operations into data centers not on-site but in the data centers of cloud services providers led by, in order, AWS, Microsoft's (MSFT) Azure, Alphabet's (GOOGL) and IBM (IBM).IBD'S TAKE: VMware was trading in above average volume Friday following its earnings, but it didn't make IBD's Stocks on the Move, the place to go to find top stocks being bought, or sold, in especially heavy volume.As the No. 1 maker of virtualization software, which lets servers run multiple operating systems and thus increases flexibility and lowers costs, VMware is a longtime leader in private cloud computing. But its focus has quickly shifted to helping companies with their hybrid — public and private — cloud computing environments.VMware also has a hybrid cloud partnership with IBM. ""We had nothing and now we have major partnerships with Nos. 1 and 4 (in public cloud services), and likely will be doing more with Nos. 2 and 3 in due course,"" Poonen said.VMware does have smaller partnerships with Microsoft and Google, companies that at times can also be rivals. But in the era of ""co-opetition"" it's seldom a ""case of black-and-white"" in looking at rivals and potential rivals, says the COO, who joined VMware in 2013. ""Almost all the (big tech companies) are potential partners,"" he said.Microsoft is a good example of a frenemy relationship, he says. VMware has security products and more for Microsoft's Office 365 software as a service. ""We have a very good partnership,"" Poonen saidThe world is moving to the public cloud, he said, and points out VMware has been building its portfolio of public cloud-focused products. But he says bigger companies, VMware's main customers, might not complete the transition for another decade, assuming they do move all operations to the public cloud.Analysts are bullish on the AWS partnership.""Consistent with our recent VAR(value added reseller) survey, the AWS partnership has prompted customers to view VMware in a more strategic light when it comes to public/hybrid cloud capabilities, which according to management has already been an accelerant to VMware's business even though the VMware Cloud on AWS service does not go live until the summer,"" Jason Ader, an analyst for William Blair, said in his research report, maintaining an outperform rating on the stock.""The strategic alliance with AWS has been a major catalyst in terms of customer perception, and ... it is already paying dividends in the form of a strengthening near-term business,"" Ader wrote.At least five investment banks hiked their price targets on VMware stock following the earnings report, which included a slight beat in Q1 sales guidance and slight miss on EPS guidance. And the company announced a $1.2 billion share buyback program, added to its ongoing $500 million buyback program.Pacific Crest Securities analyst Ben McFadden maintained a sector weight, or neutral, rating on VMware stock, but he said the share buybacks were a big plus. He also wrote, in a research note, that ""improved results have brought optimism back into the story."" But he also said ""we look for a sign of inflection in results or successful data points around the AWS partnership before becoming more positive on shares.""VMware stock ended Friday trading up 3.5% to 87.16 on the stock market today, and shares have doubled in the past 52 weeks. It sports a solid IBD Relative Strength Rating, meaning the stock has been among the top 15% in performance over the past year, with an emphasis on the most recent six months.VMware also is changing its fiscal year, which in 2016 coincided with the calendar year. Its new year's, fiscal 2018, ends Feb. 2, 2018. Its guidance is for the year that ends on that date. In May, besides reporting its fiscal Q1 results, it will separately report results for what it calls the current ""stub"" period of Jan. 1-Feb. 4.RELATED:Roundup Of Late-Thursday EarningsCould Microsoft Join Cisco In Hunt For Security Firms

86,COO,"Starbucks (SBUX) shares haven't been anything to write home about over the last year or so but have still managed to carve out a base, and fiscal first-quarter earnings late Thursday could provide enough of a jolt to send the stock into buy range.Wall Street analysts are expecting 13% profit growth — the slowest in five years — to 52 cents a share on 9% sales growth to $5.85 billion. The relatively weak profit gain comes as traffic at brick-and-mortar retailers, which are often adjacent to Starbucks locations, is losing more ground to e-commerce, pushing the company to expand its upscale offerings.""Our question is whether the company can overcome the natural erosion of traffic across retail (discussed in length at the Dec. 7 analyst day) or whether pricing efforts around premiumization are possibly too aggressive,"" wrote Buckingham Research Group analyst John Zolidis on Tuesday.While same-store sales managed to match forecasts last quarter, that metric in the U.S. has in recent quarters gotten a lukewarm reception on the Street.Wedbush's Nick Setyan said he expects ""sustained comp momentum"" in the Americas segment, while RBC Capital Markets' David Palmer said comps have been improving through the quarter. Zolidis, Setyan and Palmer are all estimating 4% in same-store sales for Q1. In Q4, Starbucks had global comp growth of 4%, and 5% in the Americas.At an investor day last month, COO Kevin Johnson said cold drinks, lunch offerings and continued digital and mobile efforts are three core comp drivers going forward.Shares ended trading up 0.4% at 58.70 on the stock market today, closing in on a 59.64 entry in a saucer-with-handle base. Investors should note a few technical points on this technical analysis. If you look at Starbucks' chart as a base going back to Oct. 30, then the midpoint of the handle is fractionally lower than the midpoint of the consolidation. But, using the 52-week high set in April, the handle — and 59.64 buy point  — are valid.McDonald's (MCD), which has tried to regain some coffee drinkers from Starbucks, was up 0.6% to 121.79, staying above its 50-day and 200-day lines. McDonald's dipped Monday after reporting Q4 results that topped views but indicated momentum from its menu revamp was fading.Dunkin' Brands (DNKN) finished up 0.5% to 52.01.IBD'S TAKE: Buying and selling stocks ahead of a company's earnings announcement can be dicey, but options plays on Swing Trader offer a way to at least cap the risk while still participating in the potential upside.Howard Schultz, who is handing over the CEO reins to Johnson in April, will be focusing on the rollout of the more premium Starbucks Roastery and Starbucks Reserve locations amid what he calls as ""over-retailed"" American consumer environment. Schultz envisions 20 to 30 ""really grand"" Roastery hot spots and a big fleet of smaller premium Reserve locations.The company's current five-year plan includes 10% revenue growth, 15%-20% profit growth, mid-single-digit annual same-store sales gains and 12,000 more locations globally.Aggressive growth plans in China mean that we can expect to see twice as many Starbucks in the country — around 5,000 — by 2021, which the company expects will nearly triple the segment's revenue and operating income.But some initiatives have proved short-lived. The Seattle Times reported earlier in the month that Starbucks planned to close its ""Evenings"" offerings on Jan. 10 amid the buildout of the new premium locations. The program attempted to turn nearly 440 U.S. coffee shops into more after-work-friendly destinations with wine, beer and small plates. (The new premium locations will offer spirits.)RELATED:Starbucks CEO Says U.S. 'Over-Retailed,' Plans To Add 12,000 StoresWhat To Expect From Starbucks' CEO Shuffle — Shaky Or Seamless?Starbucks' Schultz To Step Down As CEO; No Other Leadership Change Seen

87,COO,"Shares of rail giant CSX (CSX) soared Thursday after a report said Canadian Pacific (CP) CEO E. Hunter Harrison will step down and team with an activist investor to try to put the industry veteran in a top management position at CSX.Harrison, who helped lead Canadian Pacific's failed Norfolk Southern (NSC) takeover attempt last year, will leave five months earlier than planned, with the Wall Street Journal reporting that he will partner with Paul Hilal, who left William Ackman's Pershing Square Capital Management to launch his own fund, Mantle Ridge, last year.Harrison is also cutting ties to Canadian Pacific, which agreed to a limited waiver of non-compete obligations, according to a company statement late Wednesday. COO Keith Creel will take on the CEO role.CSX, which reported mixed Q4 results Tuesday, jumped 23.4% to 45.51 on the stock market today.CSX's board is open to talks with Mantle Ridge, but is happy with its current growth strategy, the Wall Street Journal reported.Norfolk Southern shares climbed 4%. Union Pacific (UNP), which beat earnings forecasts Thursday, added 2.4%, while Kansas City Southern (KSU), which reports Friday, reversed to end down 0.5%. Canadian Pacific climbed 3.5%.Creel will become Canadian Pacific's president and CEO effective Jan. 31, following Harrison's decision to retire.The company said Wednesday that ""Harrison had approached the board to discuss his retirement from CP and potential related modifications to his employment arrangements that would allow him to pursue opportunities involving other Class 1 Railroads.""In return for the limited non-compete waiver, Harrison agreed to end all roles with Canadian Pacific, forfeit benefits and stock awards totaling 118 million Canadian dollars, and no longer carry out a previously agreed-upon consulting role.Last summer, the company said Creel would take over July 1, 2017. He had already had stints serving as interim CEO during periods when Harrison had health issues.In April, the company abandoned its effort to buy Norfolk Southern for $30 billion amid broad opposition from industry and lawmakers. At the time, Harrison doubted that Canadian Pacific would pursue other rail rivals.The accelerated CEO handoff comes days before President-elect Donald Trump, who has vowed to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, is sworn in.

97,COO,"As Goldman Sachs Group's (GS) Gary Cohn prepares to decamp for a Trump administration job in Washington, there's no shortage of bankers lined up to replace him.Cohn, the firm's president and chief operating officer, has accepted the job as President-elect Donald Trump's chief economic policy advisor, CNBC reported Monday. Jake Siewert, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, declined to comment, while Cohn, 56, didn't immediately respond to a phone message.Jason Miller, a spokesman for the Trump transition team, said ""the president-elect has not yet made an announcement on that front, but stay tuned.""Among potential replacements for Cohn, who has been in line to succeed Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein, are seven executives on the bank's management committee: Harvey Schwartz, David Solomon, Stephen Scherr, Marty Chavez, Eric Lane, John Waldron and Pablo Salame, people familiar with the process have said.While Schwartz and Solomon are considered front-runners, it's not clear how the roles may be divided. Blankfein, 62, could choose two executives to split Cohn's duties, naming each as co-president and co-COO, as he did in 2006 in assigning the titles to Cohn and Jon Winkelried. He also may choose a different configuration, designating one as president and the other as COO, or name someone else to what's considered the steppingstone to the CEO's chair.For those bypassed for the clear No. 2 job, Blankfein has a number of options to appease them. The CEO could name one or more of them as vice chairman, an honorific and a nod to those executives deemed instrumental to the firm's success. Vice Chairmen Michael Sherwood and Mark Schwartz, considered close associates of Blankfein's, have announced their plans to retire this year. Blankfein could also sweeten the deal for an executive getting a smaller role by awarding that person a larger pay package.Here's the background of the executives thought to be in the running for Cohn's job, listed in order of likelihood, the people familiar with the company's politics have said:Schwartz, 52, was named chief financial officer in January 2013 after 15 years at the company. In one of the most visible roles at the Wall Street firm, Schwartz has slashed almost $1.5 billion in expenses as the bank copes with a revenue slump brought on by increased regulation and stubbornly low interest rates.Schwartz, whose pay package for 2016 totaled $27.7 million, joined Goldman Sachs in 1997 as a vice president in the currency and commodities-trading unit, which was then managed by Blankfein and Cohn. Schwartz, a 6-foot-4 graduate of Rutgers University, later joined the investment-banking division as co-head of a new financing group in 2004.In February 2008, two weeks before Bear Stearns collapsed, Schwartz became one of four co-heads of global sales and trading. After being named a member of the risk committee two months later, Schwartz was forced to wrestle with decisions about how to protect Goldman Sachs and allocate capital as the crisis led the firm to sell assets and hold more cash and other liquid securities.Blankfein, Cohn and Schwartz have resisted investors' calls in recent years to pull back on fixed-income trading as revenue from the unit slumped, instead urging patience even as competitors including Morgan Stanley scale back.Solomon, 54, succeeded Winkelried as co-head of investment banking in July 2006 as one of Blankfein's first appointments. Solomon joined Goldman Sachs in 1999 from Bear Stearns as co-head of the high-yield debt and leveraged-finance division before becoming co-head of equity capital markets in 2002.While the investment-banking co-heads share responsibilities, Solomon is the primary leader of the day-to-day business, with a focus on efficiency and profit. His name has long been on a short list of potential successors to Blankfein or Cohn, and was part of the group known as Goldman Sachs's ""brain trust"" during the financial crisis, according to Andrew Ross Sorkin's 2009 book ""Too Big To Fail.""Solomon was on the phone with Blankfein, Cohn, Winkelried and then-CFO David Viniar as the group engineered a deal to sell Warren Buffett $5 billion worth of stock in the form of preferred shares with a 10% dividend as well as warrants that allowed him to buy additional shares, according to Sorkin's book. The deal came the day after Goldman Sachs was named a bank holding company in September 2008 as investors worried whether it would need additional capital to stay afloat.Chavez, 52, was named chief information officer in December 2013 after being appointed to the management committee earlier that year. The Albuquerque, New Mexico, native holds a doctorate in medicine from Stanford University and bachelor's and master's degrees from Harvard University, where he took a course on Literature of the Weimar Republic.Chavez joined Goldman Sachs in 1993, working in the currency and commodities division that also produced Cohn, Blankfein and Schwartz. He left the firm in 2000 and founded Kiodex Inc., which offers risk-management services to energy companies. Chavez rejoined the bank in 2005, was named a partner the next year and has overseen Goldman Sachs's principal strategic investments group.A former director of the International Swaps & Derivatives Association, Chavez has said he's nostalgic for the boisterousness of the trading floors of the past as traders are now quiet because ""everyone's instant messaging."" Still, he said he's excited about the opportunities technology brings to banking.""The possibility of software eating the world — you can be nervous about it or you can be excited about it,"" Chavez said at a philanthropic event in May. ""It's a choice. I'm choosing to be excited about that transformation.""Scherr, 52, has been chief strategy officer since June 2014 and took over as CEO of Goldman Sachs's bank in May. The firm has been building out its banking operations under his leadership, completing the purchase of General Electric Co.'s online bank and debuting Marcus by Goldman Sachs, an online-loan service that targets consumers with credit-card debt.Scherr joined Goldman Sachs in 1993, working in the fixed-income trading division from 1996 to 1999 before moving to investment banking. A partner since 2002, he was appointed to the management committee in January 2012.He took over Goldman Sachs's underwriting business in 2008, leading it to the top spot in debt underwriting for the first time in its history. The group produced a record $4.03 billion in 2013, his last year at the helm, and also ranked first in global equity offerings. Before running the financing group, Scherr spent two years as COO of the investment-banking division.Salame, 50, was named co-head of the securities unit in 2008 after joining in 1996 as part of the emerging-markets currency-trading group. He was named partner in 2000 and assigned to help lead the global emerging-markets debt group. Two years later, he moved to London where he later became co-manager of global credit, mortgages, emerging markets trading and equity derivatives before taking on his current role. He returned to New York in 2011.He leads the partnership committee, a panel that helps define the experience of being a partner.A native of Ecuador, Salame won his doubles tennis event in the inaugural Finance Cup in 2015, helping the U.S. team top the European squad. He's also a member of the board of trustees at Brown University.Lane, 42, was named co-head of the investment-management division in December 2011 after working in the unit for 10 years. The business oversees private equity and hedge funds and handles money for wealthy individuals, and Blankfein has made expanding the unit a priority.Lane, who former Goldman Sachs executives have said is close to Cohn, joined the firm in 1996 and was named partner in 2002. He was appointed to the management committee in 2012 and, like Solomon, donated to Republican Jeb Bush's presidential campaign last year.The investment-management division, with Tim O'Neill as its other co-head, has seen total assets managed climb more than $500 billion to $1.35 trillion since Lane took the post, according to company filings. Lane and O'Neill, who've made nine acquisitions in their time running the business, have said they want to increase the unit's revenue by more than 10% a year.Waldron, 47, was named co-head of the investment-banking division in December 2014, joining Richard Gnodde and Solomon. He was named to the management committee with the promotion.During Waldron's first year co-heading the unit, Goldman Sachs topped the league tables, advising on more than $1.41 trillion of deals — a record for the firm. He joined Goldman Sachs in 2000 after following Solomon from Bear Stearns, was appointed partner in 2002 and became co-head of leveraged finance in 2005.He briefly moved to London in 2007 to become co-head of the European financial sponsors group, building a team that advises European private equity firms.

Ollie's Bargain Outlet (OLLI) will report earnings as fellow discounters Dollar Tree (DLTR) and Big Lots (BIG) approach…
"
100,COO,"Starbucks (SBUX) head Howard Schultz will step down as chief executive officer next April, the coffee shop giant said Thursday.Schultz will ""focus on retail innovation and accelerating growth of Starbucks ultrapremium retail formats,"" according to the statement on Starbucks' press site.Current COO Kevin Johnson will be the new chief executive officer. He took the new COO post two years ago, with some observers at the time speculating he was the heir apparent.On a conference call later, Johnson said no other leadership changes are planned.Schultz, currently chairman, will be executive chairman after stepping down as CEO.Shares fell 3.7% in late trading. Starbucks closed up 0.9% to 58.51 on the stock market today.Presumably more details of the succession will be provided at Starbucks' investor day next Wednesday.Schultz  joined the coffee company in 1982, then bought the retail unit in 1986, renaming its Starbucks. Schultz was a long-time CEO of Starbucks, but stepped down from 2000-2008. His return coincided with a revival in Starbucks' growth.

101,COO,"The quartet of internet stocks called FANG were showing signs of struggle Wednesday, a key reason why the Nasdaq lost just over 1%.The FANG stocks — Facebook (FB), Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google-owner Alphabet (GOOGL), were all down Wednesday afternoon, as was Apple (AAPL).Facebook fell back below its 200-day trading average, retreating nearly 2% to 118.51 in the stock market today.Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, along with Chief Technology Officer Michael Todd Schroepfer and COO Cheryl Sandberg, recently sold large blocks of Facebook stock. Insider sales are sometimes viewed as a negative.IBD'S TAKE: Apple and the FANG internet giants have not joined in the postelection stock rally, while bank, drug, defense and basic-material stocks have gained. A first step for CAN SLIM investors is to understand the difference between technical and fundamental analysis, both of which are critical to successful stock-picking.Alphabet lost 1.7% to 775.76, heading back toward its 200-day trading average after turning back from its 50-day average. Google recently announced the Pixel-branded phones, along with Google Home, a voice-activated smart speaker that challenges Amazon's Echo virtual digital assistant.Amazon, which is trading below its 50-day moving average, was down 1.5% to 750.86.Analysts say Amazon is entering a new investment cycle, evident by its third-quarter earnings report that missed estimates due to its larger-than-expected investments in various Amazon businesses. Amazon is reportedly in talks to broadcast live sporting events, which could pose a threat to Netflix and others in the streaming-video field.Netflix stock fell 0.4% to 117.04. Netflix announced it would let users download much of its content for viewing later offline, a feature that Amazon already offers and that users had requested for a long time.

102,COO,"As Walt Disney (DIS) Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger's scheduled retirement date looms closer, the entertainment giant's search for his replacement remains low-profile, a departure from the open process it previously employed.It's been seven months since heir apparent Tom Staggs' abrupt departure left Iger without a clear-cut successor. The top executive recruiting firms say they haven't been hired by Disney, and Iger hasn't moved members of his executive team into newer or more prominent roles to audition them for the top spot. The company has said only that there is a process in place that the board is following, which will include evaluating internal and external candidates.While there's still time to conduct a search before Iger's contract ends in June 2018, the quiet nature of the current succession planning stands in sharp contrast to the widely watched, five-year bake-off from which Staggs emerged as the leading contender for the job. That's fueling speculation that the board could request that Iger, 65, stay on longer than his scheduled retirement date, something it has already asked of him twice before.""I don't think anyone — employee, investor or director — would be hesitant in granting him a new contract,"" said Anthony DiClemente, an analyst at Nomura Securities in New York. ""That could happen quickly and easily. Why hasn't it happened already? That's a fair question.""Iger said on a May conference call with investors that he didn't have any plans to stick around past the current date.""The board is very actively engaged in a succession process, as it has been actually for some time,"" he said. ""It believes that it has ample time to identify a successor under timing circumstances that will be just fine for the company.""A spokeswoman for Disney declined to comment further. Disney board members on the governance and nominating committee, including former Starbucks (SBUX) CEO Orin Smith, Twitter (TWTR) CEO Jack Dorsey, Facebook (FB) Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg and former Clorox (CLX) Chairman Robert Matschullat, didn't respond or declined to comment.Typically it takes a big public company six to seven months to complete a search once the board begins to contact and interview prospective candidates, though additional time is required before that, said Peter Crist, chairman of Crist Kolder Associates, a boutique search firm outside Chicago. ""We do lots of mapping projects with the company that take months"" about the qualities it wants and needs in a new CEO, Crist said.At Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) executive recruiter Spencer Stuart began consulting with directors about what the company needed in a new leader and who they should consider about a year before Doug McMillon was named the retailer's CEO in November 2013, according to people familiar with the situation who asked not to be identified because they aren't authorized to talk publicly. The board narrowed its search to two internal candidates, McMillon and former head of U.S. operations Bill Simon, about six months before making its final decision.At Procter & Gamble (PG), directors first started talking about replacing then-CEO Bob MacDonald in July 2012 and then asked A.G. Lafley to return as CEO and chairman in May 2013. Lafley, who'd already served as CEO at P&G from 2000 until 2009, immediately reorganized the company into four businesses, each headed by a president who was considered a contender for the CEO post. One of the four, David Taylor, was named global president of home care and subsequently also took charge of P&G's beauty business.In July 2015, Lafley and P&G's other directors named Taylor the consumer giant's new CEO, concluding the two-year process.Iger himself was promoted in 2005 after a six-month search by the board. The executive, who had led Disney's TV operations and international business and had served as president for five years, was evaluated against external candidates with help from Heidrick & Struggles, directors said at the time. He got the top job only after a high-profile campaign by some shareholders to oust then-CEO Michael Eisner. Former directors in a long-running feud with the company still criticized Iger's selection as hasty, but the board said it had been thorough and careful.Until this year, it looked as if Disney's choice for Iger's successor would be more orderly, with a seasoned executive waiting in the wings in the COO position. Staggs had risen to the No. 2 spot at the company after a five-year period in which he and another senior manager, Jay Rasulo, competed with each other to become Iger's successor. The two even switched jobs to give Staggs more experience operating a business and Rasulo exposure to the executive suite. Rasulo, then serving as chief financial officer, left the company last year after Staggs' promotion to COO.Staggs' exit, after failing to gain the full backing of Iger and the board, left no other internal candidate with both operational experience and a corporate role.Of the six CEOs since Disney's founding in 1923, only Eisner came from the outside. Eisner, who served from 1984 to 2005, joined the company from Paramount Pictures, where he was president.While the board contemplates who will lead the company after June 2018, Iger remains active in planning how to shape Disney's future. In recent weeks, he considered buying Twitter, but decided to pass, partly because of price and partly because of concern about bullying on the social-media site, people familiar with the matter said last month.At an October event in Boston, Iger said it wasn't enough for the company to own key brands like ABC, ESPN and Pixar. Disney needs to have a direct connection to consumers through mobile devices, he said.""What we're thinking about a lot is what role does technology have in distributing from us to the consumer?"" he said. ""How must we invest in that?""In its search for Iger's replacement, Disney's board should be casting a wide net, looking for candidates inside and outside the company, particularly ones with high-tech chops, said Paul Winum, a senior partner at the management consulting firm RHR International and co-author of ""Inside CEO Succession.""""The landscape is changing so rapidly, technology is opening up new distribution platforms, overseas markets will be  huge opportunities,"" he said. ""The leadership skills have changed dramatically just in the last two years.""When a CEO succession plan unravels, as it did at Disney, the company usually starts thinking about the next, younger generation of executives inside, giving them bigger and different kinds of experience to prepare them for the top job, said Joseph L. Bower, a Harvard Business School professor who has studied succession planning. Disney hasn't made any major changes recently to suggest it's grooming anyone internally, however.""Disney isn't in trouble and currently has a strong CEO in place,"" Bower said. ""But you don't want someone to come in at the last minute to take over.""

Icon (ICLR) announced its earnings before the open and jumped 8% to close at 84.73. That put the stock well above a 79.71 buy point and cleared its all-time high of 84.14 from…
"
104,COO,"Banks retreated Thursday, testing buy points as Treasury yields fell ahead of earnings from Citigroup (C), Wells Fargo (WFC) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) out Friday.Treasury yields were down Thursday after a weaker-than-expected trade report out of China sent investors toward government bonds and other safe assets. Investors have bid financials in recent weeks on the prospect of Federal Reserve rate hikes and the recent rise of long-term yields around the world. JPMorgan fell 0.6% to 67.74 on the stock market today after dropping as low as 66.82, just above the 50-day line. The stock is still in range from a buy point of 65.08, cleared in early August.JPMorgan is expected to report a 17% drop in third-quarter earnings but revenue is seen rising 2% to $23.988 billion when it announces quarterly results Friday.Citigroup shares dipped 0.5% to 48.47 after sinking intraday to 47.54, below a recent 48.24 buy point. Analysts see Citi's Q3 EPS falling 15% on Friday to $1.15, with revenue down 6% to $17.344 billion. Wells Fargo shares slid 1.3% to 44.75 well below its 50-day and 200-day lines.

Independent Director Elizabeth Duke will serve as vice chair. Sloan was also named to the board.The news comes after Stumpf, who reportedly will not receive a severance payment, faced intense criticism from lawmakers and others following the bank's cross-selling scandal, in which authorities said Wells' sales staff created up to 2 million unauthorized consumer accounts in an attempt to hit sales goals.""While I have been deeply committed and focused on managing the company through this period, I have decided it is best for the company that I step aside,"" Stumpf said in a statement.""John Stumpf has dedicated his professional life to banking, successfully leading Wells Fargo through the financial crisis and the largest merger in banking history, and helping to create one of the strongest and most well-known financial services companies in the world,"" Sanger said in that statement. ""However, he believes new leadership at this time is appropriate to guide Wells Fargo through its current challenges and take the company forward.""Shares rallied 2% in late trading in the stock market today, after closing down 0.3% in the regular session.The company reports third-quarter earnings on Friday.

107,COO,"With JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC) set to report third-quarter earnings on Friday, the landscape for the big banks has enough in common with what we saw in Q2.In other words, the Fed still opted not to raise interest rates, hurting the banks' net interest margins. The state of the U.S. consumer remained generally solid. And the global ""economic uncertainty?"" That was still there too.""During the third quarter, banks faced another challenging operating environment, with uncertainty and volatility arising after the Brexit vote and lackluster global economic growth continued,"" Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst Brian Kleinhanzl said in a research note.The only good news some analysts see is no bad news.""Unfortunately, the positive might come in just not having any negatives,"" Edward Jones analyst Shannon Stemm said.But Citigroup last month cited better trading in Q3 but weaker-than-anticipated investment banking, while JPMorgan remained upbeat on the economy and the state of the consumer.Other factors will be likely to dominate the financial world's attention. Many observers will likely be cued into any commentary surrounding Wells Fargo's cross-selling scandal — in which authorities said the bank's employees created as many as 2 million unauthorized consumer accounts to hit sales targets.The scandal has cost John Stumpf his job as CEO and chairman. The bank said late Wednesday COO Tim Sloan is taking over as CEO and Stephen Sanger is taking over as chair.The Wall Street Journal reported that the bank outlined plans to rebound from the scandal during a conference call on Monday. Details from those plans could be presented on Friday.The scandal over the bank's cross-selling, a point of pride for management only a few years ago, led to some intense questioning from Congress about the bank's culture and executives' knowledge of the sales practices. The financial impact during Q3, however, was limited.Wall Street expects Wells Fargo's earnings per share to fall 4% to $1.01. Revenue is seen rising 1.5% to $22.2 billion.""The investment community's going to be looking for some specifics from the management team on what they're going to do to adjust sales practices, and what's that going to look like from a cost standpoint?"" Stemm said.""And then I think there will be follow-ons to some of the other banks, too – 'What do your sales practices look like? What are you doing to monitor both risky behavior?' What does that look like for future compliance costs?""Beyond cross-selling, KBW expects Wells' net interest margins to be constrained, even after the bank grew loans considerably in quarters past.JPMorgan, another bank KBW said was dependent on loan growth after activity rose rapidly in recent quarters, is expected to report EPS down 17% to $1.39.The bank's equity markets could be a bright spot, KBW said. Revenue is expected to climb 2% to $23.988 billion.Citigroup's EPS, meanwhile, is expected to fall 15% to $1.15, with revenue down 6% to $17.344.Citigroup in June also acquired Costco's (COST) U.S. co-brand credit-card portfolio from American Express (AXP). Citi and Costco announced their co-branded credit-card deal last March.""(Q3) will be the first full quarter with Costco in the numbers and management has already indicated that the performance within the Costco portfolio is exceeding management's expectations,"" Kleinhanzl wrote. ""If Citi can show material growth in receivables from the Costco portfolio then we would expect shares of Citigroup to do well at earnings.""KBW also said Citigroup may have gotten more of a bump from fixed income, currencies and commodities trading. But the bank has said that investment banking during the quarter was ""lighter than estimated.""JPMorgan dipped 0.3% in the stock market today, while Citigroup lost 0.6% and Wells Fargo eased 0.3%. Bank of America (BAC) fell 0.5%. Morgan Stanley (MS) fell 0.8%, while Goldman Sachs (GS) added 0.15%.IBD'S TAKE: While U.S. banking giants face tighter restrictions from regulators, their stronger capital positions have helped them take market share from European rivals, who have yet to fully recover from the financial crisis.

108,COO,"Bank stocks have rallied in recent weeks as the Fed has shown more openness to raising interest rates. Other factors could extend their gains, Morgan Stanley notes.That uptrend for the banks ""could continue if oil prices edge higher, inflation picks up, Yellen raises rates, corporates re-engage,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Betsy Graseck wrote in a research note. ""Risks include a divided government post-election, weak C&I growth, and political backlash.""Other risks for the banks include commercial lending, which KBW expects to weaken after the U.K.'s vote in June to leave the European Union caused businesses to put plans on hold, which in turn meant less borrowing.Bank of America reports Monday, Goldman reports next Tuesday, and Morgan Stanley reports on Wednesday.IBD's money center banking industry group, where most of the major banks are, was ranked 131st out of 197 groups on Tuesday.

111,COO,"When T-Mobile US (TMUS) ends its ""free"" iPhone 7 trade-in promotion this Sunday, Apple (AAPL) investors might get a better idea of real demand for the device, says Verizon Communications' (VZ) outgoing CFO.T-Mobile on Sunday plans to pull the plug on its iPhone 7 offer, which has boosted Q3 subscriber growth, said its COO Mike Sievert at a Goldman Sachs conference Thursday. Sprint (S) plans to continue with a similar ""free"" iPhone promotion, a spokesperson said. Sprint, though, could end its promotion by month's end, analysts say.T-Mobile has pre-announced that its Q3 subscriber additions will be higher than the same quarter last year. Statements by wireless firms on iPhone 7 orders have pumped up Apple stock on views that demand will surpass expectations. Apple stock is up 7% since the iPhone 7's launch on Sept. 7.T-Mobile stock rose 2.5% to 47.03 on the stock market today, retaking its 50-day line as it consolidates. Sprint climbed 4.1% to 6.62.Under the T-Mobile and Sprint deals, customers that trade-in an iPhone 6 or 6 Plus and sign up for unlimited data plans, get monthly credits spread over two years that cover the iPhone 7's cost. The promotions offer a 32 GB version of the iPhone 7.""I know some of our competitors have made a big, big announcement around the iPhone 7 and how great it is. Of course, it's great — it's free,"" Shammo said at the Goldman Sachs conference on Thursday.""The question is, when those promos end … does that (demand) continue,"" he added. ""I don't know the answer to that yet, and I still believe that (sales) volume will be similar to 2015. I don't think is going to be a 2014 event (when the iPhone 6 was launched)."" Shammo, who is leaving Verizon in November, spoke before T-Mobile presented at the conference.IBD's TAKE: AT&T and Verizon stocks were among top large-cap performers in the first half of 2016, owing to high dividend payments. But, AT&T and Verizon stocks have dropped in Q3 amid views that interest rates could rise. Sprint stock, meanwhile, has bounced up. Learn more at IBD Stock Checkup.He added that because iPhone 6's have a trade-in value of $320 or more, T-Mobile and Sprint are not really providing a $650 device subsidy in the promotions.The Verizon CFO said he expects no impact on Verizon's Q3 wireless profit from the iPhone 7's launch. Shammo says Verizon has no plans to offer unlimited data plans, like T-Mobile and Sprint.At the same Goldman Sachs conference, T-Mobile's Sievert said it expects to lower customer care and billing costs with the unlimited data offers.RELATED:IPhone 7 Bottom Line: 'Apple's Gain, Carriers' Pain'

115,COO,"After an outage in Atlanta early Monday forced Delta Air Lines (DAL) to cancel at least 450 flights and delay hundreds more, the carrier said systems were now ""fully operational and flights resumed hours ago but delays and cancellations remain as recovery efforts continue.""The company also said it would offer $200 in travel vouchers to any passenger whose flight was canceled or delayed more than three hours.""We want our customers to know we are thoroughly investigating the matter and that we are truly sorry,"" COO Gil West said in a statement.Delta's outage, which disrupted its computer systems, comes after Southwest (LUV) last month suffered a computer outage that forced the carrier to cancel more than 1,000 flights. Delta offers more than 15,000 daily flights.Delta shares fell 0.6% in the stock market today. Southwest ticked down 1.1%. United Airlines (UAL) rose 0.2%, while American Airlines (AAL), which on Friday announced an interim agreement to raise pay for 30,000 employees, was down 0.3%.IBD'S TAKE: The airline sector last week was also hit by fears of terror attacks and a CDC warning advising pregnant women not to travel to parts of Miami due to concerns about the Zika virus. See how the sector is doing at IBD's Stock Checkup.How Delta's and Southwest's outages will hurt monthly or quarterly results is unclear. Delta shares sank last week after the carrier reported disappointing July traffic figures. Other airlines are set to report monthly traffic results in the coming days.

Bezos also shed 1 million shares the week after Amazon's first-quarter report.The e-commerce giant has been on a big run, gaining 27% since breaking out of a cup-with-handle base shortly before its first-quarter earnings report in April. Amazon shares finished Friday up 0.7% to 765.98, just below their all-time high of 770.50 set on Monday.IBD'S TAKE: Amazon earns a high IBD Composite Rating of 97 out of 99 based on top-notch fundamental and technical factors including earnings and sales growth, profit margins, return on equity and relative price performance. For all the details, take a look at IBD Stock Checkup.The defense contractor's CEO, Wesley Bush, disclosed on Friday the sale of 35,000 shares for a transaction valued at $7.65 million.Northrop reported estimate-beating quarterly results last week, but a drop in technology service sales impacted its profit margin and weighed on shares.Still, the stock has been able to find support at its 50-day line. It ended Friday trading at 218.95, a penny ahead of its buy point.

117,COO,"Housed in Las Vegas' former City Hall, Zappos headquarters is part college campus, part Vegas production. The main lobby boasts a wall of severed neckties -- volunteered by job interviewees and tour attendees who feel at one with Zappos' counter-corporate culture -- plus a popcorn machine and a playable ""ShoeZaphone,"" the latter courtesy of the Blue Man Group. When employees leave for the day, they are funneled through the front entrance by design, so that they may increase their ""collisionable hours,"" i.e., chances of bumping into and organically connecting with fellow ""Zapponians.""On a visit to the Amazon (AMZN)-owned e-commerce company by IBD last year, stacks of hay were strewn across the central quad, leftovers from the previous night's charity event that hosted both Britney Spears and a petting zoo. All rather peculiar for an internet business that sells shoes and clothes, perhaps. But the vision stems from CEO Tony Hsieh, the 42-year-old entrepreneur who has made clear that he puts passion and company culture above profits.""A lot of people or companies talk about work-life separation or work-life balance, and we're really much more about work-life integration,"" Hsieh told IBD last year. ""And so a lot of people, when they go into the office, at their companies, probably most companies, they're a different person at home on weekends hanging out with their friends, vs. when they're in the office with co-workers. And they end up leaving a little part of themselves, or in a lot of cases, a big part of themselves, at home.""A curiously soft-spoken rave enthusiast who loves llamas, Hsieh reportedly lives modestly, in a trailer park in downtown Vegas. Encouraging workers to be themselves and get involved with the community leads to greater productivity, he posits.It is those quirky ideals -- culture, self-expression, ""a little weirdness,"" per Zappos' core values -- that have guided Hsieh through Silicon Valley's dot-com boom and bust and to what he hopes will become a thriving new community in the middle of the desert.The son of Taiwanese immigrants, Hsieh was born in Illinois and raised in Northern California, about a 20-minute drive from George Lucas' Skywalker Ranch. By Hsieh's own account in his memoir-slash-business-history, ""Delivering Happiness,"" his parents wanted him to get a PhD. But a tireless entrepreneurial spirit emerged early. As a 9-year-old, he tried his hand at breeding earthworms in an attempt to become ""the No. 1 worm seller in the world."" (Spoiler alert: He did not. The worms escaped.) In middle school, he flirted with the publishing business with a newsletter, ""The Gobbler."" (Discontinued after the second issue.) But a button-making business wound up raking in about $200 a month, planting the idea in Hsieh's mind as early as middle school that ""it was possible to run a successful business by mail order, without any face-to-face interaction."" Fast-forward to college -- Harvard, to please his ambitious parents -- and Hsieh's self-starter tendencies continued to wriggle free of the grasp of traditional academia. He crowdsourced a study guide, collecting research from classmates and then selling the collaboration back to contributors for $20 a pop. Later, he turned a profit on buying and then reselling McDonald's burgers at his fast-food-free campus.Not long after that, he started a pizza business on the first floor of his dorm, calculating that the low-cost pies would provide high margins. Unbeknownst to Hsieh at the time, fellow Harvard student and ""No. 1 customer"" Alfred Lin was actually reselling individual slices of those pizzas to his dorm mates, Hsieh recounted in his book. Perhaps fittingly, Lin would later become Zappos' CFO and COO.Working for someone else was never Hsieh's style -- taking a job at Oracle (ORCL) right out of college, he quit after just five months to start his own business.Hsieh was perhaps best known in the mid-to-late 1990s for co-creating with Sanjay Madan the web advertising network LinkExchange, which offered companies free ad space on other web pages if they, in exchange, hosted banner ads on their own sites. Some of the remaining ad space would then go to paying customers.The pair sold the startup to Microsoft (MSFT) for $265 million less than three years after its 1996 inception, following a period of hypergrowth that brought in too many new hires that, in Hsieh's estimation, were driven by the prospect of financial gain instead of passion for the company. ""The reason we ended up selling the company was that the company culture ended up going completely downhill, and it just wasn't a fun place to work at anymore,"" Hsieh told IBD. ""So for me, I didn't want to repeat the same mistake again at Zappos, and from the beginning, culture was always important.""After first investing in and then joining Zappos in 1999, Hsieh's happiness-focused ideals have been integral to shaping the company's goals, both existentially and financially. Internally, there are events like Bald and Blue, in which employees shave their heads for charity, while externally, Hsieh's team tries to cultivate working relationships with vendors that aren't simply about squeezing suppliers to benefit the bottom line, and has a perhaps unusual devotion to customer service.Part of Hsieh's emphasis on culture prompted him to move the company from San Francisco to Nevada, because ""Bay Area people didn't want to work in a call center,"" and he did not take to the idea of outsourcing calls, as many other companies do.His dedicated Zappos customer-service call center will field just about any question, and staff members aren't pushed to upsell customers or rush them off the phone. Zappos call center rep Steven Weinstein reportedly broke the record on June 11 for the longest customer call, chatting to the caller for a whopping 10 hours and 43 minutes.""It was excellent, the connection was amazing, and even though I never spoke to this customer before in my life, I felt like I knew her for 15 or 20 years,"" he told Business Insider in July.Zappos' customer-first attitude has paid off: In its first 10 years, it went from being a company with precious few sales to a billion dollars in annual gross merchandise sales, said Hsieh in his book. And its acquisition by Amazon in 2009, valued at $1.2 billion, has left the culture untouched. ""We're very different from their other subsidiaries or acquisitions, where prior to the acquisition, the only way we would consider doing it is if they left us independent and we could continue to have our own culture and brand (and) different way of doing business,"" Hsieh told IBD. He thinks of the ""marriage"" to Amazon as simply swapping out Zappos' previous board of directors for a new one.As a leader, Hsieh is described as being fairly hands-off. ""He likes to give space and opportunities to people. (He's) definitely not a micromanager by any means,"" Jeanne Markel, Hsieh's technical advisor, told IBD in early 2015. She says he is always ""very open"" to listening to employees' suggestions and ideas. ""As crazy as his schedule is, he's very accessible and willing to listen. I think he gives people a lot of rope,"" she said. Hsieh says Zappos employees ""work together, we hang out together. . . . I don't really manage their time.""The Zappos office reveals a little slice of Silicon Valley quirkiness that Hsieh has brought to Vegas. There's a resident ""life coach."" The gym walls feature prison bars from the old City Hall jail cell. Leading a tour group through the HR department, a Zappos guide flips on a switch, and employees jump up and begin dancing with Shake Weights in hand.Eccentricities aside, some of Hsieh's tactics are controversial. His implementation of ""holacracy"" -- a manager-less management style that nixes a conventional top-down hierarchy in favor of self-organized ""circles"" -- is meant to help the company run more like a city than a business.""It's designed to be constant change, and so I think, for some people, that's definitely uncomfortable,"" he said, later adding that ""there are so many companies that were big companies, great (companies) from 30 years go, even 10 years ago, that now are irrelevant or out of business because they couldn't adapt to the changing environment. And so holacracy allows the organization to be a lot more flexible and adaptable."" In his March 2015 announcement of the self-management plan, Hsieh offered voluntary buyouts to employees unwilling to follow it. And according to a blog post by current Zappos COO Arun Rajan, 18% of the company, or 260 employees, opted to leave.""If they're in this for the money, then they're not in it for the right reasons,"" Markel told IBD after ""The Offer,"" as it was called in-house, was made.Beyond the company, Hsieh's perhaps-even-loftier vision involves revitalizing all of Downtown Las Vegas. He has notably invested $350 million into the downtrodden area north of the shimmering, tourist-heavy Strip. The Downtown Project co-owns and invests in over 300 businesses, by its count, including the members-only dog park Hydrant Club; the whiskey cocktail bar Oak & Ivy; and the Downtown Container Park, a collection of shipping containers that house small businesses. (Hsieh's Burning Man sensibilities have extended to the decor. A 55-foot-tall, fire-breathing,  metal praying mantis sits at the entrance of the shopping center.)At the Airstream trailer park, where Hsieh lives, there are ""campfires almost every night, except in the summer (when) it's really hot,"" said Daniel Park, a musician and fellow trailer resident who sees Hsieh around the park ""almost every day.""There is just one entrance. The neighbors share community laundry, kitchen and pantry facilities, including a ""big fridge usually filled with beer"" and a nearby ""giant piggy bank"" that funds refills with resident donations, he said. They hang out often, playing board games or video games or just drinking around the fire.""A big living room is what we have,"" said Park, who added that the space also houses two resident alpacas. Rent is around $1,000 a month, he said.Downtown Project said last year that it generates $118.9 million in annual economic impact, citing an Applied Analysis report, and has created over 1,000 jobs in the area. But media reports have cast doubt on the development effort's success, after about 30 project staffers were laid off in 2014 with a source telling Recode then that local businesses were ""bleeding money."" Hsieh has waved off critiques of the Downtown Project, arguing that it takes 10 to 20 years for most revitalization projects to cement. And Park described it as ""still changing, but always for the better. The vibes are great down here."" He highlighted the local art, music and mom-and-pop restaurants, but feels ""we just need more housing downtown.""Checking in with Hsieh a year after IBD's initial visit, the entrepreneur remains bullish about both holacracy and the Downtown Project. This year he is looking forward to ""getting everyone (at Zappos) up to speed and fluent in holacracy,"" and building out residential developments in Downtown Las Vegas, he said via email in February. He only wishes he had done both sooner.That optimism harks back to something he had said in early 2015.""I think there's a segment of the population that wants to know what the plan is. 'What are steps 1 through 10?' "" Hsieh then told IBD. ""And there's others that really -- me, for example -- that really enjoy the creativity and improvisation that comes with not knowing how things will turn out, but at the same time having the confidence and faith that you'll figure it out.""Built Zappos into a billion-dollar brand.Overcame: The rigidity of traditional corporate structures.Lesson: Get comfortable with change.""There is a quote that is often attributed to Darwin (whether Darwin actually said it is up for debate, but I believe the general principle to be true): 'It is not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent that survives. It is the one that is most adaptable to change.' I believe the same is true for companies, and especially for entrepreneurs.""Related:Phil Knight Cleared Hurdles To Make Nike A Merchandising ChampionBeach Books For Businesspeople

123,COO,"Contact-lens maker The Cooper Companies (COO) reversed lower on the stock market Friday despite its Q2 earnings and full-year guidance surpassing expectations late Thursday.Jefferies analyst Anthony Petrone raised his price target on the stock to 190 from 175 and affirmed a buy rating, saying that his survey suggested the redesign of Cooper's Clariti disposable contacts drove results.For the quarter ended April 30, Cooper's earnings rose 19% over the year-earlier quarter to $2.05 a share, excluding one-time items, beating analysts' consensus by 14 cents. Sales increased 11% to $483.8 million, about $20 million above consensus.Cooper added 20 cents to its full-year EPS guidance range, now $8.20 to $8.50 vs. $7.44 last year. Its sales guidance of $1.93 billion to $1.96 billion is $60 million higher than previously and up from $1.8 billion last year.Cooper stock jumped as much as 3.6% but closed down 1.2% on the stock market today. The stock, which has been forming a long cup base since April of last year, holds a strong IBD Composite Rating of 91.The coming launch of Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) new silicon hydrogel monthly lens in July came up several times during Cooper's earnings conference call with analysts, though J&J's contact-lens division performed fairly weakly in Q1.""In the guidance, there's a modest deceleration compared to what we had previously forecasted to anticipate, if you will, some impact of the J&J rollout,"" Cooper CEO Bob Weiss said on the call.Wall Street has questioned whether J&J's decision in April to abandon its unilateral pricing policy on its contacts will put pricing pressure on the whole field, but Weiss downplayed its importance.""I know that some vendors may have -- or retailers may have -- altered J&J prices,"" Weiss said. ""But by and large, the market continues to drive itself the way it has in the past. Pricing is not really a factor. It's all about trading up and shelf space.""

124,COO,"Cooking-equipment maker Middleby (MIDD) spent a good part of last year trying to address a troubling situation: 75 reports that gas ranges made by Viking, the high-end oven maker it bought some three years ago, were turning on by themselves. Viking recalled around 60,000 ovens due to those reports, and Middleby -- which makes cooking appliances for homes and restaurants -- stresses those ovens were made prior to the acquisition. But the recall heightened problems within Viking that weighed on Middleby's finances. Among them: Delays in refrigeration products Middleby had been trying to make more energy-efficient, concerns about Viking's residential products and questions over whether the $380 million Middleby paid was too much for a company seen as lacking new ideas or sufficient margins.For Middleby officials, quality concerns of this magnitude are not what they're used to encountering.""Papa John's (PZZA) runs our oven almost 18 to 20 hours a day -- especially on weekends,"" Chief Executive Selim Bassoul told IBD. ""And it cannot break down. It is not allowed to break down.""Yet shares of Middleby are up around 32% since February as the company turns out sales growth that outpaces competitors and works aggressively -- and to a large extent effectively, some analysts say -- to turn Viking around. The company has a 98 Composite Rating out of a best-possible 99. That sales growth has been led by an array of kitchen items that cater to more selective home chefs and a competitive restaurant industry, which has been set on international expansion and on serving food in a way that's quicker, fresher and more cost-effective.Roth Capital analyst Tony Brenner wrote in a research note last month that new product introductions addressing increased speed, energy and labor saving ""should continue to play a key role in increasing sales and margins."" Those gains would also come as the bar rises for service, even within fast food.  An array of big restaurant chains are customers of Middleby -- Starbucks (SBUX), McDonald's (MCD), Wendy's (WEN), Domino's Pizza (DPZ) and Yum Brands' (YUM) KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell -- along with higher-end chains. Want an oven that can cook a pizza in 90 seconds or a steamer that saves water by utilizing the food's moisture? Middleby has those. Need an oven that can make a steak look and taste like it was fussed over by a chef, or an oven system that can do the work of a line cook or two? Middleby has some of those too.Middleby has a lot of those things in no small part because of acquisitions. It has made more than 40 since 2000, according to the Great Lakes Review stock-picking service, with most of those deals coming during Bassoul's tenure. ""He never sits on his laurels,"" Elliott Schlang, Great Lakes' founder, said of Bassoul. ""He's always doing something new and innovative, to broaden his product line and to give the restauranteur what he needs.""Restaurants, Bassoul said, face greater demand for breakfast, potentially requiring adjustments to space in the kitchen and on the grill. Greater demand for delivery and analytics, he said, will necessitate more connected, automated cooking equipment. And higher employee wages -- as have been demanded industrywide -- are inevitable.""It's going to happen,"" he said. After reaching an intraday high of 127 on June 8, shares slipped below their 50-day moving average Friday in light of the U.K. Brexit selloff. Shares ended Monday trading around 110. That means restaurants will likely seek technology in place of people. The company's Kitchen of the Future, a conveyor-oven system with an infrared broiler and warming cabinet, helps restaurants get more usage out of each square foot. The system also uses technology that cuts usage of oven burners when not in use.    ""This array replaces convection ovens, fryers, microwaves, grills, charbroilers and salamanders (broiler units), prepares food faster and with greater consistency and can eliminate two or three line cooks from the kitchen,"" Brenner wrote. Profit margins on such projects, he said, ""reportedly exceed 50%.""Middleby's ventless cooking equipment saves energy -- and a lot of money -- because it doesn't require a large, bolted-down ventilation system. Since much of a kitchen's layout hinges on where ventilation is located, ventless technology helps kitchens become more flexible with floor space and menus. The company's holding trays can also control for moisture and heat, enabling restaurants to keep items fresher for longer and served quickly.""People have a tendency to think this stuff tastes like airplane food,"" BB&T analyst Schon Williams said of machine-prepared items. ""I've done a lot of taste tests -- and it's improved the taste concept among customers.""The company's food and beverage equipment has also helped some restaurants with an international presence to step up their breakfast game, although Middleby wouldn't say who.""We have a number of key executives throughout our organization that literally know how to build a store, build a restaurant, build a small-box retail operation, that know how to lay out a kitchen, that actually have done that,"" COO David Brewer told IBD.And as more people aspire toward the artisanal in their homes, the sophistication in Middleby's commercial operations has made its way into its residential products. Viking plans to launch an oven that, it says, can cook a rack of lamb in four minutes and a 12-pound turkey in 42 minutes.The company could also use design elements from AGA Rangemaster, a U.K. company it acquired that's known for its rustic-chic ovens and cast iron cookers, to make fancy home products even fancier.Management's experience in cooking equipment has also helped during the company's rare moments of difficulty, as with the Viking acquisition.After that acquisition, the company deployed scores of engineers to Viking to assess potential problems. In quality tests, they hung weights off of refrigerator doors, which could sometimes fall off, Williams said, and in one instance Bassoul slammed an oven door over and over until it broke.The company strengthened Viking's packaging materials. Following the recall, Middleby has sued former senior staff at Viking, and Middleby's salesforce has worked to reclaim goodwill among dealers and made the wiring of Viking ovens less complicated.""That's a hallmark of Middleby, just in terms of reducing the number of parts, reducing complexity whenever possible,"" Williams said. He later added: ""Time and time again they've proven they can restructure all these businesses.""Almost all Viking dealers have resumed buying the company's products, Middleby says. As restaurants expand internationally, so will Middleby, and Bassoul hopes to make its Viking residential platform a more global entity.Steel prices, Schlang noted, risk hurting the bottom line if they rise, and the company's food-processing business still lives project to project, analysts say. Brenner also said that Middleby's main competitors are bigger and have deep pockets. Manitowoc (MTW) is among its biggest rivals, but its focus isn't exclusive to food service.Restaurant same-store sales were also sluggish in the second quarter and could lag through the year. But as they try to keep costs down and investors happy, equipment could play just as much of a role as the food in improving what they offer to customers.""You can do that in a simple way,"" Brewer said. ""You can put the ketchup on top of the meat patty, you can put ketchup underneath the meat patty, add a pickle -- that maybe gets you a quarter. But eventually you have to bring in a new bread and toast it a different way.""

126,COO,"Time Warner (TWX) is gearing up for an epic battle this Sunday on HBO's ""Game of Thrones,"" but it's Viacom (VIAB), Walt Disney (DIS) and 21st Century Fox (FOXA) that are engaged in shuffles at the top.Sumner Redstone's National Amusements, which holds about 80% of Viacom's voting stock, said late Thursday that it would ax five members of the board, including current Viacom CEO Philippe Dauman.One of the affected directors, Frederic Salerno, has filed suit to seek ""an expedited determination that Shari Redstone's attempted removal and replacement of Viacom directors is invalid and that the directors elected at the 2016 Annual Meeting continue to serve.""Redstone has reportedly lost confidence in Dauman and the current board, but critics question the 93-year-old's mental soundness and whether his daughter and current board member, Shari, is pulling strings behind the scenes.""If the changes to the composition of the board are upheld in court, it seems clear that Sumner Redstone will at some point seek to replace Philippe Dauman as CEO of the company,"" wrote Credit Suisse analyst Omar Sheikh.The five new directors include Buzzfeed Chairman Kenneth Lerer, former Sony (SNE) Entertainment President Nicole Seligman and former DreamWorks SKG co-COO and current Avis Budget Group (CAR) Executive Chairman Ronald Nelson.RBC upgraded Viacom to sector perform from underperform on the leadership shuffle.Viacom also issued guidance early Friday, with expectations of $1-$1.05 in per-share adjusted diluted earnings for the third quarter and 4% domestic ad sales declines. The outlook falls well short of current analyst views for $1.38 EPS.Viacom, which soared late Thursday on the board shake-up on hopes for a change in direction for the struggling cable and movie empire, closed down 1.4%.Meanwhile, Fox on Thursday named current Twentieth Century Fox Co-Chairman Stacey Snider as the new chairman and CEO of the movie studio, with current head Jim Gianopulos to step down on June 30, 2017, and transition to a ""strategic role,"" said the company in a statement.The move comes amid $250 million in anticipated cost cuts, announced in February, that reportedly includes staff reductions in Fox's TV and film units.James Murdoch, rose to succeed his father Rupert as CEO of 21st Century Fox last year. His brother Lachlan Murdoch serves alongside Rupert Murdoch as executive co-chairman.Shares fell 1.1% to 28.81 on Friday.Separately, Walt Disney's CEO succession plan is still murky after Tom Staggs stepped down in April as COO of the media conglomerate.

127,COO,"Fears of a broad cybersecurity freeze could amplify after vendors Palo Alto Networks (PANW) and FireEye (FEYE) missed April-quarter expectations and Check Point Software Technology (CHKP), Fortinet (FTNT) and Imperva (IMPV) guided toward slower growth.Then again, rather than a broad slowdown, the pure-play security leaders might in fact be losing some business to tech giants Cisco Systems (CSCO) and IBM (IBM), which are expanding deeper into security, and to specialized security vendors such as CyberArk Software (CYBR), Proofpoint (PFPT) and Mimecast (MIME).""Investors tend to look at security as a single sector, and the reality is you have a lot of different plays here,"" Pacific Crest analyst Rob Owens told IBD. ""In aggregate, we're seeing relatively consistent spending. There is some shifting that is happening, but that makes sense.""Security spending overall rose 13% year over year in Q1, barely down from 14% growth in Q4, Owens says. He says those growth rates are consistent with the past two years.Palo Alto, Fortinet and Check Point all had been hot stocks in 2014 and much of 2015 on the strength of their broad security platforms, but not this year. The focus has shifted to specific security areas such as privileged account management, email and cloud security, and endpoint protection, analysts say. So, while some vendors might be slowing, others are rising, Owens says.Fears of a broad security slowdown go back to last year, Owens told IBD.""We've been having this end-of-the-world discussion for a year now,"" he said. ""Certain vendors that may have been growing at rapid rates (have) decelerated.""Palo Alto Networks -- the No. 2 security software company by market cap, behind Check Point -- is an industry bellwether.Last month, Palo Alto disappointed Wall Street. It guided to 37% year-over-year sales growth for the current quarter, which would be great for most companies but would represents the highflier's slowest-ever growth. Last quarter was the first in eight where its sales rose less than 50%.But the slowdown is relative, Pacific Crest's Owens says.""Palo Alto will continue to perform well, but it can't continue to grow at four times the industry,"" he said. ""Fifty percent to 60% growth is unsustainable.""Piper Jaffray analyst Andrew Nowinski anticipated slow April demand for Palo Alto products, citing checks with resellers.But Dougherty analyst Catharine Trebnick characterized the April slowdown as a ""blip"" in a typically seasonally weak quarter. She blamed FireEye CEO David DeWalt for the panic. During FireEye's fiscal Q3 earnings call in November 2015, DeWalt said ""emergency spending"" in the wake of the notable Target (TGT) and Home Depot (HD) breaches had normalized.""The CEO of FireEye last year said, 'You're just not having all these big breaches and we're not getting attacked from China as much, so spending is slow,'"" she said. ""So, everyone has been chanting the mantra.""(DeWalt is set to step down June 15, leaving COO and Mandiant founder Kevin Mandia to take the reins. FireEye acquired Mandiant in 2014.)Palo Alto Networks wasn't the only pure player to spot braking growth. On May 5, FireEye guided to its slowest quarter ever, and Imperva's outlook for this quarter would mark a fourth straight quarter of sales deceleration. In April, Check Point guided to 6% growth for Q2, down from six straight periods of 9% growth.Fortinet expects sales growth to slow to 27% in Q2 from 34% growth in the prior quarter. And even email specialist Proofpoint -- among those analysts peg as on the rise -- guided to its slowest quarterly growth in 11 quarters, to 32% growth from 37% the prior quarter.IBD's 26-company Computer Software-Security industry group reflects fears of a general tech slowdown. The group was down as much as 34% for the year in early February, hitting a two-year low, as many tech stocks tanked on dour views from LinkedIn (LNKD) and Tableau Software (DATA). The group has since recovered in part, but is still down nearly 16% for the year.Cybersecurity Ventures Managing Editor Steve Morgan says pure players like Palo Alto, Check Point and Fortinet are no longer good barometers for the health of the industry. Instead, thousands of venture-capital-backed startups -- as well as tech giants increasingly expanding their security presence -- are gouging share.In Q1, IBM pulled in $400 million in security sales -- topping Palo Alto, Fortinet and FireEye, and closing in on Symantec (SYMC) -- up 18% vs. the year-earlier quarter and accelerating from 12% growth in all of 2015. Its overall sales fell 5%. For its fiscal Q3 ended April 30, Cisco said its security sales jumped 17% year over year, accelerating from 11% growth in fiscal Q2.Still, the accelerating growth for the IBM and Cisco security businesses falls short of the decelerating growth for most of the pure players. The big companies, though, aren't going away.Microsoft (MSFT) swept three cybersecurity players off the public map in 2015 via acquisitions, but the company doesn't break out its cybersecurity revenue, Morgan points out. And Dell subsidiary SonicWall, acquired in 2012, is potentially pulling in billions, but since Dell is now privately held those figures aren't reported publicly.""That revenue just goes away from what's reported in the public market,"" Morgan told IBD. ""Unless you cover the market really carefully, you won't hear about it.""But the cybersecurity VC market is still booming, he says. In 2015, Dow Jones estimated that $1.9 billion in VC funding was spent backing cybersecurity startups, Morgan says. At one time, it was unheard of for cybersecurity startups to raise more than high single digits in funding, and ""now we're routinely seeing (funding hit) $50 million, $75 million, $100 million.""Those VC-backed companies are ""competing aggressively in the market,"" Morgan said. ""But if they're not public, their revenue figures aren't necessarily being reported.""As private businesses like MalwareBytes, the Herjavec Group (tied to Robert Herjavec of the ""Shark Tank"" TV show) and Black Duck Software begin to achieve scale, they'll further steal share from the publicly traded security firms, Morgan says.Pacific Crest's Owens sees pent-up demand. He says companies still aren't spending enough on security. He ballparks annual IT spending overall near $1 trillion, and cybersecurity spending at $25 billion to $30 billion.""I think security has been an under-spend area for decades,"" he said. ""You're spending about 3% of your capex (capital expenditures) that's focused on IT on security. That's relatively low. Some regulated industries like health care might be two or three times that, but there's still a long way to go.""Building up security spending takes time, Owens says.""There's that perception that you're able to spend an unlimited amount of dollars overnight within security, but that's just not the case in reality,"" he said. ""It's not an overnight type of thing.""Network security still has headroom, Owens says, and he sees products focused on authentication, detection, remediation and endpoint solutions as leaders. Summit Research analyst Srini Nandury pegs privileged account management -- CyberArk's bread and butter -- as the industry's next growth vector. Dougherty's Trebnick expects email security providers like Proofpoint and Mimecast to pick up share. Morgan's bet is on cloud security.Meanwhile, Symantec, Juniper Networks (JNPR), Barracuda Networks (CUDA) and FireEye will continue to struggle, Owens says. Symantec may ""throw out billions in cash flow"" to survive attempts to transition from legacy antivirus to next-generation endpoint protection. FireEye is shifting to a subscription model. Juniper and Barracuda deal with broader macro issues outside cybersecurity, he says.So, back to the original question: Is security spending slowing?Not for many, Morgan says.""What I think you're seeing is a squeeze on the pure-play company,"" he said. But overall, instead of any slowdown, ""I think we're entering an uptick. Spending is up, undoubtedly.""

130,COO,"Walt Disney (DIS) shares plummeted late Tuesday on a second-quarter miss, as the House of Mouse noted a decline in both ESPN subscribers and the sports network's advertising revenue.But CEO Bob Iger sees a ""very robust marketplace and a very strong upfront"" season ahead for both ABC and ESPN, he said during the post-earnings call.Shares sank 5% late, after closing the regular session up 1.2%.ESPN didn't consume the Q2 call as it did during the previous quarter, but Iger did say that the channel's inclusion in over-the-top bundles correlated with some ""very encouraging sign-ups.""Instead, focus drifted to Hulu, which has become an ""important investment for us not just as a distributor but as a buyer of original product,"" according to Iger, and he put Hulu's recently announced live-TV package as a ""best of cable approach"" that lies somewhere between a big, expanded bundle and lighter packages, such as those from Dish Network’s (DISH) Sling TV.Disney is ""fully aligned"" with joint Hulu co-owner 21st Century Fox (FOXA) on a strategy for the over-the-top platform, he said, and doesn't foresee Disney having issues related to being both a content distributor and a content creator.The lookout for a successor to Iger's chief exec spot also came up, as Wall Street tries to anticipate who will take the helm of the media titan.Iger was mum on the circumstances of Tom Staggs' recent exit from the COO post, but confirmed that he has no plans to extend his contract beyond June 2018, when he is currently scheduled to step down as CEO.The board is ""actively engaged in a succession process as it has been for some time,"" he said, and the board believes it has ""ample time"" to identify a successor.The media conglomerate's Q2 earnings per share grew 11% to $1.36, excluding items, and revenue rose 4% to $12.97 billion, falling short of expected adjusted EPS of $1.40 on $13.19 billion in revenue.Media networks revenue, which includes the cable networks and broadcasting units, was ""relatively flat"" at $5.8 billion. Cable networks revenue fell 2%, while broadcasting revenue rose 3%.ESPN revenue rose, but advertising revenue notably decreased, and the company said affiliate revenue growth was ""partially offset by a decline in subscribers."" Iger had said in a February call that ESPN had experienced a slight uptick in subscribers in recent months.Studio revenue shot up 22% to $2.1 billion, bolstered by the theatrical success of ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" and the recently released ""Zootopia.""Parks and resorts revenue rose 4% to $3.9 billion. The anticipated Shanghai Disney Resort opens on June 16.Consumer products and interactive media revenues fell 2% to $1.2 billion.Notably, Disney shuttered its Infinity console games business, taking a $147 million charge during the quarter. While the company ""did quite well"" with the first iteration and ""OK"" with the second iteration, console gaming is a changing business that ""we didn't have the confidence"" to stay in, said Iger during the call, asserting that Disney was better off staying in licensing than publishing.RELATED:Verizon, Disney Bury The Hatchet Over ESPN, Skinny TV BundleWhat ‘Captain America: Civil War’ Means For Disney Ahead Of Earnings

132,COO,"Media titan Walt Disney (DIS) appears to be in pretty good shape heading into Tuesday's second-quarter results, as a super-team of theatrical releases continues to crush it at the box office.But as indicated by the previous quarter, investors may let their thoughts again drift to the Dark Side, as months-long hand-wringing over the state of the broader pay-TV environment just will not abate.Walt Disney investors were divided like the Avengers in Marvel's ""Captain America: Civil War."" Shares rose as high as 106.68 early on the stock market today, moving past a buy point at 105.70. But shares reversed to closed down 0.2%.As of late Monday, Wall Street expects Disney to log 14% profit growth to $1.40 a share on a 6% revenue gain to $13.2 billion.""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" should again prove to be a revenue-booster, with moviegoers choosing the seventh installment of the hallowed Lucasfilm franchise over newer releases in recent months.According to Box Office Mojo, the movie remained high in the box office rankings -- coming in at No. 14 over the April 1-3 weekend -- around the end of Disney's Q2 and close to four whole months after its big-screen premiere. The movie has so far raked in almost $2.1 billion worldwide.Disney's reign over movie theaters also includes the success of ""Zootopia"" and box-office leader ""The Jungle Book,"" though the latter counts toward the current quarter.Captain America has already pulled an estimated $181.8 million from its U.S. opening weekend, giving it a global box-office total of over $678 million since it debuted abroad in late April, said Variety. The film’s debut displaced “Iron Man 3” as the fifth-best all-time best domestic opening weekend.But the recent departure of Disney COO Tom Staggs - Iger's heir apparent - will likely prompt questions during call late Tuesday. And the question of ESPN’s subscriber data looms large.Despite a solid Q1 earnings and revenue beat on Feb. 9, lofty expectations and a hyper-focus on ESPN subscriber numbers dogged Disney shares the next day, with the stock sinking 3.8% on Feb. 10.Disney acknowledged previous subscriber losses but noted a more recent uptick amid the popularity of skinny cable bundles that include ESPN.Even if Q2 results top views, CEO Bob Iger may again get grilled about cable subscription figures, as he was during the previous quarter's earnings call.Why the persnickety attention to one sports cable channel amid a sea of products from the House of Mouse? For one thing, Disney's cable networks segment alone made up almost 30% of Q1 revenue (the greater media networks segment accounted for 41.5% of revenue for the quarter).By contrast, the studio entertainment unit only comprised 12.5% of Disney's overall Q1 revenue.""If (ESPN) looks more stable in the March quarter -- and management did say on last quarter’s call in February that Sling TV subs had helped overall subs tick up again -- then the DIS relief rally could continue,"" wrote Macquarie analyst Tim Nollen on April 26.""If there is any indication of weakness or further uncertainty at ESPN, or the cable networks in general, then DIS shares could struggle again.""More pressingly for the industry, the performance of Disney's cable networks might be taken as an indicator of the health of the greater media and pay-TV environment. It was, after all, comments about ""modest declines"" in ESPN subscriptions that helped fuel a media-stock meltdown last August.But Time Warner (TWX), CBS (CBS) and 21st Century Fox (FOXA) all reported solid earnings results over the past week, and Iger hinted in February that ESPN could come in more streaming forms.The sports channel is currently a member channel of Dish Network's (DISH) Sling TV, Verizon Communications' (VZ) Custom TV and Sony's (SNE) PlayStation Vue bundles.""While we expect a messy quarter due to the timing of the college football games (Q1 vs. Q2 last year), we expect the cable affiliate revenue to grow 2.9%,"" wrote Piper Jaffray analyst Stan Meyers. ""We do expect to see some upside from recent inclusion of ESPN into Verizon's Custom TV and Sony's Vue packages.""Lastly: Hulu, of which Disney is part-owner, might prove to be an interesting discussion point come Tuesday. The over-the-top service said this week that it is developing a live-TV package, which is reportedly expected to include ESPN.RELATED:Hulu’s New Service Could Give Netflix, Cable A Run For Their MoneyDisney CEO: ESPN, Star Wars, Marvel ‘Tailor-Made’ For StreamingDisney Lost More Subscribers In Q1 But Seeks New ESPN Platforms.

134,COO,"FireEye (FEYE) CEO David DeWalt is stepping down, replaced by Mandiant founder Kevin Mandia, the cybersecurity firm announced late Thursday as it reported Q1 sales that missed Wall Street views and gave consensus-lagging Q2 guidance.Mandiant President Travis Reese will take up that mantle at FireEye, and FireEye CFO Mike Berry was named chief operating officer in addition to his current role. DeWalt will become executive chairman of the FireEye board.""With these leadership announcements, FireEye has moved to solidify our position in the market today and more importantly, prepare us for growth opportunities going forward,"" DeWalt said in a statement.FireEye acquired incident-response company Mandiant in 2014, and its founder was groomed inside FireEye. Mandia has served as FireEye senior vice president and COO, and was named to the board in 2015.In after-hours trading, after FireEye posted earnings and announced the CEO change, FireEye stock was down 8%. Shares fell 1.3% in the regular session. Shares are down 23% this year, following the recent acquisitions of iSight Partners and Invotas.For Q1, FireEye reported $168 million in sales, up 34% year over year, and a 47-cent per-share loss minus items, shrinking by a penny vs. last year's losses. Analysts had modeled a 50-cent per-share loss, so the bottom line beat, but they expected sales of $171.8 million.Billings ex items of $186 million topped the high end of FireEye's three-months-ago guidance for $163 million to $183 million.Current-quarter guidance for $178 million to $185 million in sales and a 38-cent to 40-cent per-share loss ex items missed the consensus of 35 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters for $192.8 million and 36 cents losses.

137,COO,"Priceline (PCLN) CEO Darren Huston resigned Thursday after an internal investigation into an inappropriate relationship with an employee, but shares were down just a fraction in morning trading.The sudden resignation is effective immediately. Huston resigned without severance and forfeited his unvested stock options, Cowen analyst Kevin Kopelman noted in a research report. Kopelman still rates Priceline stock outperform.Chairman Jeffery Boyd was tapped to lead Priceline as the board searches for Huston's successor. Boyd served as Priceline CEO from 2002 to 2013 and was succeeded by Huston in January 2014 after a lengthy, planned transition.Booking.com President and COO Gillian Tans was named CEO of that key Amsterdam-based Priceline subsidiary. Boyd initially joined Priceline in September 2011, leaving Microsoft (MSFT) to take the Booking.com CEO position.Huston's resignation stemmed from an independent board investigation into a personal relationship with an employee not under his direct supervision, Priceline said in a statement.""The investigation determined that Mr. Huston had acted contrary to the company's code of conduct and had engaged in activities inconsistent with the board's expectations for executive conduct,"" Priceline said.Huston acknowledged the conduct and expressed regret, the company said.Priceline stock has risen 14% since January 2014, when Huston took the helm.

""However, Priceline has commented to media outlets that the misconduct did not involve the company's financial reporting or controls.""Indeed, Priceline spokeswoman Leslie Cafferty told IBD via email: “This did not involve issues about the company's financial statements, accounting or internal controls over financial reporting. This resignation was not related in any way to the company’s operational performance or financial condition.”RBC analyst Mark Mahaney reiterated his outperform rating on Priceline stock. Boyd's return will provide ""continuity, experience and leadership,"" he wrote in a report. Tans' role as Booking.com CEO is also a key positive, he said.Priceline's fundamentals remain strong, Mahaney said.""These trends constitute one of the most robust growth and profitability profiles across the Internet sector,"" he wrote.

145,COO,"The two hedge funds that criticized United Airlines’ (UAL)  board appointments last week decided to air their complaints publicly after the air carrier resisted making former Continental Airlines CEO Gordon Bethune its chairman, derailing months-long negotiations between the parties, according to a Reuters report Monday.Those funds, Altimeter Capital Management and PAR Capital Management, also object to United's plans to make CEO Oscar Munoz chairman by next year and felt that the board’s move to give Munoz a $12 million signing bonus ""should have been tied to performance goals,"" Reuters said.The talks between United and the funds broke off this month, Reuters said. The fight over United's board, if it continues, could complicate Munoz's full-time return to his duties as CEO, which was set for Monday.After only weeks on the job, Munoz suffered a heart attack last year and was put on medical leave. Munoz became CEO after Jeff Smisek stepped down from the post in September amid a U.S. investigation into possible corruption involving United's relationship with the former chairman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.The report comes after United last Monday added three new independent directors to its board -- including a former COO of Delta Air Lines (DAL) and a former CEO of Air Canada -- with plans to add a fourth soon. The appointments expanded the board to 15 members, from 12.A day later, the two hedge funds, which combined have a roughly 7.1% stake in United, wrote the board a letter that called the appointments ""desperate ... a transparent and cynical attempt to maintain your official privileges and power."" The funds said that they would nominate six board candidates, headed by Bethune, at United's 2016 annual shareholder meeting.The funds said that they intended their decision to ""give United stockholders the opportunity to elect the board they deserve.""The funds also said, “Meaningful change to United’s existing board of directors is urgently required in order to reverse long-standing poor board governance and the resulting many years of substantial and inexcusable company underperformance relative to United’s competitors.”United has called the funds' planned nominations ""hostile,"" said that it had “repeatedly” expressed willingness to change its board, and added that the funds “refused to cooperate in making their nominees available to be interviewed.”Despite their conflicts, the funds and United would consider a settlement to head off a vote on the funds' board nominees, Reuters reported Monday.Bethune was Continental's CEO from 1994 to 2004. United agreed to merge with Continental in 2010. Low fuel costs have padded the company's profits, and United has touted improvements in its on-time performance. But the company had struggled to keep pace with rivals Delta and American Airlines (AAL).United shares are down 13% over the past 12 months but have risen since February, finding support at their 50-day and 200-day lines. Shares rose 1.1% to 58.98 in the stock market today.Delta rose 0.4% to 47.89. American ticked up 0.3% to 42.59.

148,COO,"Six stocks in Friday's edition of IBD Stock Spotlight boast a Composite Rating of 99.Among these six -- which include gun maker Smith & Wesson (SWHC), China's TAL Education (XRS) and nutritionals firm Omega Protein (OME) -- Facebook (FB) likely possesses the largest impact on the stock market itself and the most exciting growth prospects for investors.As seen at the top of the Nasdaq composite's chart on IBD's ""What's The Market Trend?"" page (B9 in Monday's paper), Facebook is the fourth largest company by market value on the Nasdaq. Its $306 billion market cap is equivalent to nearly 4% of the entire exchange.Equally important, Facebook is the sort of once-in-a-generation company that has revolutionized business and the way people communicate. Truly great stock market winners are special that way. So, will Facebook at some point enter the pantheon of great stock market winners, a list that includes Wal-Mart (WMT), Home Depot (HD), Microsoft (MSFT), Dell and Cisco Systems (CSCO)?What are Facebook's advantages? One is strong management. COO Sheryl Sandberg was a key player in developing the advertising business at Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) before joining Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg's team. (For the sake of disclosure, this writer went to college with Sandberg.) Two, Facebook has succeeded in keeping its website the most attractive way for users to connect and share with others online.Three, acquisitions are producing value, such as its 2012 buy of Instagram for $1 billion in cash and stock. Four, institutional investors are showing confidence in the company. As of the end of 2015, 3,054 mutual funds and hedge funds held shares in Facebook, up from 2,679 at the end of Q1 that year.Creative destruction runs at a fast tempo in the Internet field. That is, new competitors can come in and take away market share quickly. That's why the media has paid attention to new social media firms such as Snapchat of Venice Beach, Calif.

149,COO,"Continental Resources (CLR), a top producer in the Bakken shale formation, said Wednesday it has ceased fracking operations there amid the continued slump in oil prices.The bellwether shale company had already planned to defer most Bakken completions in 2016. It has four operated drilling rigs in the North Dakota Bakken with plans to maintain that level through the year.But Continental said it currently has ""no stimulation crews deployed in the Bakken.""Shares were up 2% in after-hours trading in the stock market today.Continental posted an adjusted net loss of 23 cents per share in Q4, down from a profit of $1.14 per share a year ago. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters were expecting a loss of 21 cents per share. Revenue sank 55.6% to $575.5 million, above views for $568.2 million.But Continental was bullish on acreage in its STACK play in Oklahoma, and expects an average estimated ultimate recovery of 1.7 million barrels of oil equivalent per well.""Our overpressured Meramec wells in STACK are delivering some of the highest returns in the Company,"" said COO Jack Stark in a statement. ""We clearly have another high impact, long-term platform for growth underlying our 155,000 net acres of leasehold in STACK.""The company plans to average four-to-five operated drilling rigs in the STACK play in 2016.Last month, Continental guided 2016 capital spending to $920 million, down 66% from 2015. It also sees production falling during the year on lower drilling and well completion activity.Other shale companies reported Q4 results below estimates late Wednesday and further reduced capital spending plans.Concho Resources (CXO) swung to a Q4 adjusted loss of 7 cents per share from a profit of 88 cents per share a year ago, missing views for a profit of 4 cents a share. Revenue sank 34.5% to $389.2 million, well below views of $525.4 million.Concho sees 2016 capital spending of $1.1 billion-$1.3 billion vs. $1.8 billion in 2015, which was already a 20% drop from 2014. The company expects full-year 2016 production will be flat-to-down approximately 5% vs. 2015.Shares were unchanged late.Oasis Petroleum's (OAS) earnings tumbled 85.7% to 5 cents a share, missing analyst estimates by a penny. Revenue fell 39.2% to $182.1 million, under views for $238 million.Oasis set its total capex budget at $400 million, down from $610 million in 2015, when it dropped 61%.For the year, Oasis said that 70% of its projected oil volumes are hedged to more than $51 per barrel for U.S. crude. On Wednesday, West Texas Intermediate futures settled at $32.15 a barrel, up 0.9%.Oasis shares jumped 4% after hours.Unlike Exxon Mobil (XOM)  and other integrated oil majors, shale producers don’t have downstream operations that benefit from cheap oil to help cushion profit during price slumps.Earlier this month, Cabot Oil & Gas' (COG) quarterly results swung to a loss and Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) posted a better-than-expected loss but cut its spending outlook just a month after offering more bullish guidance.EOG Resources (EOG) reports Thursday. EOG is expected to swing to a 31 cent per-share loss down from a per-share profit of 79 cents. Revenue is expected to fall 53.2% to $525.4 million.Earlier Wednesday, Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) said it is closing its unconventional resources unit, with its shale assets becoming part of its upstream business, and projects in Canada becoming part of its downstream unit.Chesapeake Energy's (CHK) Q4 results swung to a loss and revenue fell 47.5%. The oil and gas producers said it has signed deals to divest $700 million in gas fields and other assets, well above its $200 million-$300 million target, and plans to sell $500 million-$1 billion in additional assets this year. Chesapeake will also cut 2016 capital spending by 57% to $1.3 billion-$1.8 billion and sees production falling by as much as 5% excluding asset sales.Meanwhile, the Energy Information Administration said that U.S. inventories rose by 3.5 million barrels vs. the 7.1 million barrel build the American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, reported late Tuesday. Analysts expected a rise of 3.4 million barrels.

153,COO,"Be careful about whom you listen to on Wall Street. Not one of the 30 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters came close to predicting the non-GAAP earnings of $1.66 per share Citrix Systems (CTXS) reported late Wednesday for the fourth quarter. The consensus stood at $1.19, and the highest estimate was $1.22.""What I hear is a little different than what I see,"" Executive Chairman Bob Calderoni told analysts on the company's earnings conference call late Wednesday. ""The things I see are pretty good. ... The things I hear, I don’t believe.""What Calderoni sees is a reorganized, more profitable software developer, Citrix, extending the versatility of Microsoft (MSFT) operating systems in the cloud with desktop virtualization, server and networking software known as XenApp, XenDesktop, XenMobile, ShareFile and NetScaler.Investors had driven Citrix stock down 3.4% Wednesday to 65.90, near recent lows and 21% off its three-year-plus Oct. 28 high at 84.17. But Citrix gapped up early Thursday on the report, and shares rose more than 8% in early trading in the stock market today, near 71.50.EPS minus items rose 51% from Q4 2014. Revenue rose 6% to $905 million vs. the $877 million analysts expected.What Calderoni sees are ""the competitive wins turning in our favor,"" he said. ""We see that in the win-loss data, we see that in the results,"" including a growing backlog.What he sees in the current Q1 is $785 million to $790 million in revenue, with the $787.5 million midpoint 3.5% better than Q1 2015. He sees Q1 EPS minus items of 91-93, the midpoint up 41.5%. What he hears may be the 90-cent EPS on $786 million estimated by analysts for Q1.For 2016, Citrix guided adjusted EPS to $4.65 to $4.75, the midpoint up 8.3% from 2015's $4.34,  on sales of $3.315 billion at the midpoint of a tight range, up only 1%.Cash flow from operations  in 2015 reached $1.03 billion from $846 million in 2014, and the company now has about $2 billion in cash and liquidity, COO and CFO David Henshall told analysts. The company spent about $802 million repurchasing 11.4 million shares in 2015, at an average price of $70.38 per share, strengthening the stock's market price. The board added $400 million to Citrix's authorization to buy back more stock, in addition to $33 million remaining from earlier authority, the company said.""This was another step in the right direction for Citrix as the company delivered solid results, and importantly, healthy guidance with a bigger buyback for the bulls to hang their hat on,"" FBR Capital Markets analyst Daniel Ives told IBD. ""The company clearly has growth challenges ahead, but ramping margins, free cash flow and expanding its product tentacles are key to the Street with a new CEO now at the helm.""He maintained his outperform rating and 83 price target for Citrix stock.Not everyone was as upbeat as Ives.""CTXS closed 86 transactions worth over $1 million (each, up from 58 in Q3 and 90 in Q4 2014), 20% of which included the company’s full Workspace Suite offering (which also accounted for 20% of Workspace Services license revenue vs. 9% in Q4 2014),"" Evercore ISI analyst Kirk Materne wrote in a research note Thursday.

He begged off when an analyst asked for his vision of what Citrix will look like in two or three years.He spoke of ""mobilitiy and secure delivery of apps and data. ... Cloud is another driver. It’s now unstoppable as people build out more data centers serving clouds. (That's) what propels this company to the future and its next phase of greatness.""But he asked for ""two more days"" before he volunteers what Citrix will look like in 2018.

(HES) on Tuesday announced a 2016 E&P capital and exploratory budget of $2.4 billion, down 40% from 2015 and 20%below  its earlier 2016 guidance issued in October. Full year oil and gas production is expected to be at 330,000-350,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day vs. 2015 production of 368,000 barrels of oil equivalent.""In response to the current low oil price environment, we have significantly decreased our 2016 capital and exploratory expenditures and we plan to reduce activity at all of our producing assets. Moreover, we will continue to pursue further cost reductions and efficiency gains across our portfolio,"" said COO Greg Hill in a release.On Wednesday Hess reported a loss of $1.40 per share, 7 cents above analyst estimates, its first quarterly loss since 2002.

They also said CEO Dorsey plans to add board members, his first since naming Omid Kordestani, a former executive at Alphabet (GOOGL) unit Google.It's the first major shakeup since co-founder Dorsey returned to take over last year.  But Twitter has seen a slew of high-level turnover in recent years. Weil was the fifth product chief in six years. Stanton joined Twitter in 2014 after previous positions at (Alphabet) Google and Yahoo (YHOO).Dorsey has tried to revive Twitter's fortunes by making it more attractive to non-core users, such as adding Moments to highlight breaking news events. He's reportedly been interesting in breaking Twitter's 140 character limit, perhaps allowing people to write up to 10,000 characters.The C-level departures will put more pressure on Dorsey, who is also CEO of payments firm Square (SQ). Square, like Twitter, fell to a record low last Wednesday.

So much exciting potential there.— Jason Toff (@jasontoff) January 25, 2016Twitter stock fell 4.6% in the stock market today, closing at 17.02. Twitter stock is trading 57% below where it was this time last year and is down 77% from its all-time high of 74.73, brushed in late December 2013.The company’s stock price has remained below its offering price of 26 since mid-November, prompting takeover speculation.“We don’t see how the departure of the heads of three major business divisions can be viewed as a positive in the middle of an attempted business turnaround,” said Stifel analyst Scott Devitt, who downgraded Twitter to hold from buy in an industry note on Monday.Weil, Stanton, Schipper and Roetter are among the highest-level departures in recent months, but several executives have left Twitter since co-founder Dorsey stepped in as interim CEO in July. He was named permanently to the Twitter CEO post in October.""It's difficult to see anything positive in this headline on the surface as the brain drain continues.  And unfortunately, we don't think this is the end of it either, but it could very well be the most significant shakeup yet,"" wrote Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co. analyst James Cakmak in an industry report on Monday.With a CMO search in the works, Cakmak offered up American Express (AXP) CMO Leslie Berland as a possible replacement.  ""We like this potential appointment as American Express, despite its recent shortcomings, is a global and well-respected brand.  We think she would be a good fit,"" said Cakmak, who maintains a buy rating on Twitter stock.Dorsey, who is also CEO of financial services technology company Square (SQ), hasn't detailed plans of how Twitter will recalibrate its business. Dorsey plans a retreat with Twitter executives this week, according to Reuters.Besides facing competition from rivals including Facebook, Twitter is struggling to expand its user base. It has launched programs to reel in ""logged out"" users who visit Twitter's site, but don't have accounts of their own, making them less coveted by advertisers.Twitter said Q3 average monthly active users rose 11%, year over year, to 320 million. That’s up from 316 million users in Q2, but Twitter reported year-over-year user growth of 15% in Q2 and 18% in Q1. Twitter had its slowest user growth in 2015 and was eclipsed by photo-sharing app Instagram, owned by Facebook (FB), which surpassed 400 million users last year.Twitter posted Q3 earnings and revenue that beat Wall Street views, but its user growth slowed and its Q4 sales guidance missed analyst estimates. For Q4, Twitter guided revenue of $695 million to $710 million, up 46% at the midpoint, but analysts had modeled $739.7 million. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters now expect Q4 EPS ex items of 12 cents, flat with a year ago, on $710.3 million in revenue.Twitter is set to report Q4 earnings after the close Feb. 10.Facebook stock fell 1% to 97.01.

161,COO,"In 2006, when now-retired Chip Burke spotted the first hints of the financial crisis that would slap America deep into recession, he shifted his portfolio to Fidelity's online brokerage.Burke never worked at Fidelity, but he knew the financial firm from his decades in the asset management industry, which included stints as a bond trader, floor trader and COO of a market maker-specialist firm. ""Fidelity was always old school — well-run, well-funded, conservative,"" said 61-year-old Burke, who still invests for himself and his family.""I didn't know what the trouble would look like,"" he told IBD recently. ""But I knew which people I wanted in my corner."" Those people were Fidelity.Over the years, Burke found additional reasons to like Fidelity. And his loyalty illustrates some of the reasons that Fidelity landed high among the top five online brokerages in IBD's annual survey of investors.View Full 2016 Best Online Brokers ReportFidelity On Top AgainIn fact, this is Fidelity's second straight year grabbing first place overall.Fidelity earned the highest ratings from survey respondents in their assessments of online stock brokerages' research tools, portfolio analysis & reports, investment research, educational resources and trade reliability.It repeated as top dog in the first four of those. It's the newly crowned champ in the fifth area.It made the top five in another five categories, including ETF choices, equity trading tools, customer service, mobile platform/mobile trading opportunities and site performance, a new category.Fidelity's rating did not decline in a single category. And its rating rose in three categories: trade reliability, customer service and mobile platform/mobile trading opportunities.Ram Subramaniam, president of Fidelity's retail brokerage business, says the firm makes a point of helping investors as they mature and their financial needs grow more complex.""Many of our customers start as self-directed investors,"" he said. ""But they get to a point in life where their needs grow. They're not just picking individual investments. They want to create a financial plan, make provisions for their family members. We take pride in helping customers make that transition.""And most if not all of the assistance has been formatted for online customers. Fidelity still has 190 physical investment stores in 173 U.S. cities where clients can go in and take care of business ranging from deposits and withdrawals to financial planning. That's up from 150 storefronts five years ago. But more and more clients have switched to making the bulk of their contact online.Subramaniam is also proud of Fidelity innovations in the past year, aimed at making customers' financial lives easier.App For Apple WatchThe online brokerage, part of the behemoth Boston money management complex which overall administers $5.2 trillion, introduced apps for Apple TV and the Apple Watch. ""Those give you a convenient way to keep tabs on the markets and to explore investment ideas,"" Subramaniam said. The watch app gives investors access to real-time quotes, market data, instant notifications for all Fidelity orders, and price triggers. Fidelity has no public timetable for allowing trades via the watch.The firm also launched Investor Notebook, a sort of digital briefcase for use on a desktop computer, tablet or mobile device. ""It's a tool where customers can organize their thoughts on investing,"" Subramaniam said. Customers can even insert photos of financial documents. ""You can take a picture of a check, and deposit it electronically, so you don't have to walk to a bank to make a deposit,"" he said.And Fidelity recently became a key financial-firm partner on Amazon Echo, Subramaniam added. Through Echo, a voice-interface system, users can get stock quotes as well as information about weather and traffic, or just play music.Fidelity has also upgraded features on Active Trader Pro, a platform for people who trade more than three times a month.And in January Fidelity debuted a new 2%-back Visa credit card. ""You can deposit the money you get back in your retirement account, college savings account, brokerage account or wherever,"" Subramaniam said. The card has no annual fee, and there's no cap on the amount of spending on which Fidelity will rebate your 2%.Lower commission & fees is a survey category in which Fidelity finished out of the top five for the fourth straight year.Fidelity isn't overly concerned, satisfied that its growing throng of customers recognize the value that the company delivers. ""Value goes beyond the headline commission rate,"" Subramaniam said. ""It's important that retail customers understand the total value.""Part of that total package, he says, is Fidelity's price improvement — the difference between the actual trade execution price vs. the national best bid for sellers and national best offer for buyers — on the average market. For Fidelity, the average price improvement on an order for 1,000 shares is $10.49 vs. the $1.26 industry average. That improvement essentially offsets the entire commission, Fidelity says.On bonds, Fidelity charges $1 per bond. Fidelity customers save on average close to $14 per bond vs. retail customer costs at brokerages that charge a markup.Asked how Fidelity will try to improve this year — with its eyes on a three-peat atop IBD's annual best online brokerage survey — Subramaniam cites several areas. ""We'll continue to expand our overall experience for investors,"" he said. More research tools and resources will be a second area. He added, ""And we are definitely going to offer innovations in mobile devices and for Active Trader Pro, the two cornerstones where we can push the envelope of innovation.""

193,COO,"For 2016, Celgene guided EPS of $5.50 to $5.70, up 19% from the expected final 2015 number but on the low side of analysts' $5.68 projection. Product sales were guided at $10.5 billion to $11 billion, while analysts forecast revenue of $11.1 billion.
"
194,COO,"Nonetheless, Celgene added 5 cents to its 2020 EPS guidance, which it had already raised last summer, to $13 from $12.50.

"
196,COO,"Scott Smith, who heads the inflammation and immunology business, will add the role of chair of the Global Management Committee.
"
197,COO,"Regarding Q4, Celgene said it included a 7-cent charge due to a $70 million milestone payment to OncoMed (OMED) stemming from positive data of demcizumab, a cancer drug that Celgene has licensed. Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum wrote in a research note that it was ""unclear"" whether the consensus forecast had factored that in, but he wrote that both the other numbers were basically in-line.
"
198,COO,"Speaking at the conference, Hugin said that in Q4, Celgene had to absorb a 17-cent hit from closing its $7.2 billion acquisition of Receptos, which brought potential blockbuster immunology drug ozanimod. He was highly optimistic about Celgene's budding immunology franchise in general; psoriasis drug Otezla launched in 2014 and brought $472 million in 2015, which Hugin called ""the most successful launch of any therapeutic in the history of this therapeutic area in terms of its progress in this first full year of launch.""

205,COO,"Also Monday, Illumina unveiled a new partnership with Bio-Rad (BIO) to develop a next-generation sequencing solution to analyze a single cell. Single-cell analyses are useful in understanding cell variations in cancer and other diseases, Flatley said, but normally they are analyzed only from a small batch. Illumina and Bio-Rad aim for a high-throughput solution combining their technologies, which they expect to launch late this year or early next year.

But its proud parents are willing to foot the bill to create a video streaming powerhouse.While Hulu has been on a hot streak — signing content deals that make it a stronger rival to Netflix and Amazon.com's (AMZN) video streaming service — costs are rising.Co-owner Walt Disney (DIS) referred to Hulu's ""higher content and marketing costs"" in its fiscal Q4 earnings release.How much Hulu is in the red isn't clear.""It's true that Hulu has and is going to continue to step up their investment in both acquiring and producing original programming and programming from others, and that will continue to increase their losses in the near term,"" Disney COO Thomas Staggs said on the company's earnings call late Thursday.""We believe it's going to create value over time, and we think there's value in them strengthening their offering. And furthermore, the market is big enough for them and others to thrive. So we feel good about where they're going strategically.""Disney, 21st Century Fox (FOXA) and cable TV firm Comcast (CMCSA), which controls NBCUniversal, are co-owners of Hulu. The three media companies backed away from selling Hulu in 2013 and then pumped $750 million into the joint venture.Comcast is barred from taking part in Hulu's management until 2018 under conditions regulators set on its 2011 acquisition of NBCU.Hulu's ad-free streaming subscription service is off to a good start, Fox said on Wednesday. Fox, though, declined to disclose subscriber uptake.Hulu launched an ad-free version of its video streaming service on Sept. 2. While Netflix's Q3 U.S. subscriptions were about 25% shy of estimates, the impact of Hulu's ad-free model hasn't been clear.Netflix blamed online payment problems for its subscriber shortfall.Follow Reinhardt Krause on Twitter @IBD_RKrause.

"
267,COO,"""While Twitter's management led by CEO Jack Dorsey has presented to investors a structured set of corporate and monetization strategies, it is difficult for investors to look past the empirical results at hand: Q3 monthly active user results and Q4 revenue and EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) guidance were both below Street estimates owing to tepid user growth and a decelerating monetization,"" Nomura analyst Anthony DiClemente wrote in a research note Wednesday.
"
268,COO,"The company is rolling out new products, launching its first TV ad campaign and adding services to broaden its appeal to casual users, moves some analysts praise, but for now user growth remains an issue.
"
269,COO,"""While investors are hopeful that restructured leadership can engineer a revival via new products like Moments, as long as Twitter user growth remains stalled, it will be difficult for revenue to reaccelerate, muting the three- to five-year growth outlook,"" DiClemente said.

285,COO,"In order for Twitter to begin growing again, Windsor said, the microblog ""must break out of its mold and begin addressing the other activities that users enjoy on smartphones and tablets.

292,COO,"A trimmed-down Twitter (TWTR) is heading into Q3 earnings on Tuesday after the close with a new management team at the helm and new products for the microblog as it struggles to attract users and attain profitability.
"
293,COO,"User growth and engagement — keeping those users coming back and spending more time on the microblog — is a key item to focus on, said RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney in an earnings preview note on Friday.
"
294,COO,"""Twitter grew monthly active users 15% year over year in Q2 to 316 million, decelerating 4 points from Q1's growth rates,"" Mahaney said.
"
295,COO,"A 2-point deceleration is expected for Q3, said Mahaney, who is estimating that Twitter's global user base grew 13% year over year to 323 million users. That implies an addition of 7 million users quarter-over-quarter in Q3 2015 vs. an addition of 13 million in Q3 2014, Mahaney said.
"
296,COO,"""We note that Twitter made no mention of user metrics in its pre-announcement, which may be seen as a negative,"" Stifel analyst Scott Devitt said in an Oct. 14 research note.
"
297,COO,"Twitter's monetization gap will be another area of intense scrutiny.
"
298,COO,"Twitter values each member of its logged-out audience at the rate of $2.50 per year, former Twitter CEO Dick Costolo told a Goldman Sachs (GS) technology-conference audience in February. By comparison, Costolo said, logged-in Twitter users worldwide were each worth an average of $4.35 to the company.
"
299,COO,"""Twitter monetizes its users at a much lower rate than Facebook (FB) but is steadily closing this gap,"" said Mahaney in his report.
"
300,COO,"Twitter generated $1.43 for every monthly active user in Q2 2015, compared to $2.61 for Facebook, while Twitter grew its monetization 41% year over year compared to Facebook's 26% year-over-year growth, he said.

"
304,COO,"Kordestani assumes the post that Jack Dorsey vacated when he was officially named Twitter's CEO. Kordestani had been Google's chief business officer until the August corporate restructuring that made Google the largest division of Alphabet.
"
305,COO,"The series of moves at the top keep known brands in control of the company.

"
307,COO,"The company estimates that it will incur between $10 million to $20 million in severance costs from the layoff of a group of workers largely comprised of engineering and product staff. The cuts represent about 8% of Twitter's workforce of 4,100 and restructuring expenses are estimated at $5 million to $15 million.

The cuts represent about 8% of Twitter's workforce of 4,100 and restructuring expenses are estimated at $5 million to $15 million.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Twitter to report revenue of $559.4 million, up 55% year over year.Twitter is now guiding Q3 revenue to be at or above the high end of the $545 million to $560 million guidance range it gave in its last quarterly report, up 51% to 55%.Analysts expect Twitter to post EPS ex items of 5 cents, up from 1 cent in Q3 2014.Twitter carries a relatively weak IBD Composite Rating of 66 out of a possible 99.

"
449,COO,"Gilead Sciences has been on a winning streak in recent years. But competition and price pressure may push the biotech pace-setter to go for acquisitions to continue the momentum.Gilead's (GILD) Q1 revenue climbed 52 percent from the year-earlier period, while the company's per-share earnings more than doubled. The Foster City, Calif.-based Gilead's annual sales total more than $27 billion, and through the past three years, market value has risen more than fivefold to reach an impressive $177 billion. The stock earns the best possible IBD Composite Rating, 99, which means that the stock has outperformed 99% of all other stocks in a combination of factors including Earnings Per Share and Relative Strength Ratings.Gilead has flourished by focusing on treating HIV and hepatitis patients. Hepatitis C drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni have chalked up more than half of the company's product sales.But a backlash has been building about Sovaldi, because Gilead has priced the drug at $1,000 per pill or $84,000 for the 12-week life of the treatment.""Any time you get a major move like that one, it's very hard for people to completely forget about it,"" said Michael Holland, head of New York money management firm Holland & Co. ""Management has the task of showing people that the biotech boom isn't ready to end yet — and that Gilead will continue to be a major player in the industry. They have to show the world that they have a strong and long-lasting growth strategy, just in case this kind of bad news surfaces again.""""Consumerism is growing in health care, and Gilead will surely feel pressure because of the prices it charges,"" said Paul Carroll, a partner with Devil's Advocate Group, a consulting firm for CEOs. ""This pressure will take some time to build, because any attempt to deny the use of medicine based on the cost brings people out of the woodwork shouting, 'Death panels!' Gilead needs to be preparing a 'doomsday scenario' to imagine what life will be like in a world when it can no longer charge $1,000 per pill.""Not everyone agrees. ""Despite the rhetoric surrounding Sovaldi, Gilead is in a very strong position strategically,"" says Dan Mendelson, CEO of health business advisor Avalere Health. ""It's in a strong position globally because Hep C is one of the big public health issues of our time.""As Dr. Barnett Mennen, a physician of long experience with the pharmaceutical industry, has said, Sovaldi ""has changed the game for many patients. They've offered a cure. How much is that worth to someone who is suffering?""Where Gilead Is VulnerableFactors other than price may put pressure on Gilead. The company's shares plunged about 15 percent last Dec. 22, reaching a four-month low, after the FDA approved rival AbbVie's (ABBV) hepatitis-C product.Around the same time, AbbVie forged an agreement with Express Scripts (ESRX) to offer its drug at a lower price. It became the only hepatitis-C product that the big pharmacy-benefit entity sanctioned.Industry observers say that Gilead can handle the pressure. ""It may be looking at a few acquisition targets"" as a way to lock in its continued solid growth, Brian Skorney, an analyst with Baird in Milwaukee, told IBD.Jacob Plieth, senior editorial analyst at EPVantage, also expects Gilead to pursue acquisitions. ""It's hard to know how else they can proceed. ... when you have a competitor coming in.""In a recent earnings conference call, Gilead COO and President John Milligan said, ""We typically like (acquiring companies) where we can have impact on phase three (drug trials) and where we can accelerate those products either into the approval process or integrator indications after the approval process. And I tend to think still we're looking for things where we feel we can catalyze the development of those products and have a greater utility over them overall.""Acquisition TargetsIn early May, Gilead acquired Danish drugmaker EpiTherapeutics. But which other companies would Gilead buy?Skorney is eyeing such potential takeover targets as South Boston, Mass.-based Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), a global biotech entity that has drawn praise for its work in cystic fibrosis.Vertex could ""fit in nicely with Gilead,"" Skorney said, pointing out that Vertex has put its stamp on treating cystic fibrosis, much as Gilead has focused on hepatitis C. Also, Vertex has more than a dozen continuing programs targeted at other life-threatening diseases.Acquisitions are nothing new to Gilead. In 2011, the company announced an $11 billion acquisition of Pharmasset, giving it further range in treating hepatitis sufferers. The acquisition turned out to be a huge success.But not all acquisitions succeed. ""M&A remains dicey, and there is a long history of bad acquisitions in the pharmaceutical world,"" noted Carroll of Devil's Advocate.Nevertheless, EPVantage's Plieth said, ""Gilead is in a very strong position right now. It has been one of the most amazing biotech stocks, looking back over the past 10-12 years.""

452,COO,"Airbus (EADSY) edged out Boeing (BA) Thursday in the commercial orders race at the Paris Air Show, which saw stronger-than-expected demand for new passenger jets.The European aerospace giant received orders for a total of 421 aircraft, worth $57 billion at list prices. Boeing received orders and commitments for 331 planes valued at $50.2 billion. Buyers typically get undisclosed discounts for large orders.The combined tally of 752 eclipsed forecasts for a weak year as record backlogs and saturated growth markets were expected to weigh on demand. Before the show, Cowen analyst Cai von Rumohr predicted that Boeing and Airbus would have less than the average of 387 orders combined.Boeing shares closed up 1.4% on the stock market today. Airbus dipped 0.7%. Aerospace supplier United Technologies (UTX), which owns engine maker Pratt & Whitney, rose 0.7%. Honeywell (HON) gained 1.3%, and General Electric (GE) edged up 0.4%.This year's tally also topped last year's total of 687 at the Farnborough Airshow, which alternates with the Paris show each year. But Airbus' total was down from last year, when it received orders and commitments for 486 aircraft. Boeing's orders were up this year, as it had deals for just 201 planes at Farnborough.The 2015 number was also down from the 2013 Paris Air Show, which saw orders for 908 aircraft between the two aerospace giants. Blockbuster deals two years ago were led by new planes, including Airbus' A320neo and Boeing's 737 Max and 787 Dreamliner. Those planes have more fuel-efficient engines that were in demand at a time of high oil prices.But while the orders from the past week came in higher than expected, the Paris Air Show failed to impress some analysts.""There weren't any huge surprises there,"" said Robert Mann, president of aviation consultancy R.W. Mann & Co. ""I don't think anyone took home a trophy — unless in the Little League sense where everyone gets a trophy.""The Paris show's orders point to capacity increases in Asia, with China and Indonesia leading the way, he added. Garuda Indonesia, the country's flagship carrier, was among the big buyers at Paris, making deals to buy 30 Dreamliners and 30 737 Max jets from Boeing and 30 A350s from Airbus.Capacity should grow slightly in Eastern Europe, but Mann said most of the orders from the region will be for replacement planes.Major deals in prior shows came from Middle Eastern carriers, which kept a low profile this year as tensions with European and U.S. carriers heat up over capacity increases and competitive practices.Qatar Airway's A380 was featured at the show, but the airline didn't announce any big deals, like the 50-plane order it announced with Boeing at the 2014 Farnborough Airshow.No new planes from the two aircraft giants debuted at the show this year, though there was plenty of buzz over Boeing's acknowledgment that it's looking at a new mid-size plane and is already talking to potential customers about its requirements.Boeing was on track to finish the Paris show with the most orders, helped by a deal from aircraft lessor AerCap (AER) for 100 737 Max jets.But Wizz Air, a low-cost European carrier, made a provisional agreement at the last minute for 110 A321neos, worth $12.5 billion, putting Airbus in the lead. Airbus had forecast only 200 total orders and commitments at Paris.Both Boeing and Airbus must now manage bulging backlogs and plans to ramp up production rates. The companies have a combined backlog of 12,000 planes. Airbus is boosting output of its popular A320 airliner by nearly 20% to 50 per month in 2017. Boeing is lifting production of its 737 to 52 planes per month in 2018 vs. 42 currently.Supply chain issues may curb production growth. Last year, Air Lease (AL) COO John Plueger called the increase in Boeing and Airbus production a ""major concern"" and that suppliers are operating at ""absolute capacity."" GE has opened seven new engine parts plants in seven years to help keep up.Orders are expected to keep rolling in over the long term. Boeing sees demand for over 38,000 airplanes in the next two decades, with single-aisle planes the most sought after. Airbus sees demand for 32,600 new planes in the next 20 years.Follow Gillian Rich on Twitter: @IBD_GRich.

455,COO,"Investors have had an insatiable appetite for fast-casual restaurant stocks, evident by a surge in initial public offerings in the past year and big first-day gains.
"
456,COO,"Another serving is coming. Chicken-wing king Wingstop (WING) is set for an IPO that begins trading Friday.
"
457,COO,"The Dallas-based company raised the estimated price of its offering Tuesday, suggesting investors are hungry for shares.
"
458,COO,"Wingstop fits into the popular fast-casual restaurant segment, a type of restaurant that does not offer full-table service but provides a higher quality of food with fewer frozen or processed ingredients.
"
459,COO,"According to research firm Technomic, annual sales in the fast-casual segment in 2014 increased at more than three times the rate of the total restaurant industry.
"
460,COO,"Technomic says the fast-casual field boosted annual sales approximately 13% last year to $39 billion.
"
461,COO,"While that is a small share of the total restaurant industry's $466 billion in annual sales, it compares with a growth rate of 3.8% for the entire restaurant business.
"
462,COO,"Wingstop follows the May 8 IPO of Bojangles (BOJA), a Southern-style chicken-and-biscuit chain that raised $147 million. Bojangles stock priced at 19 and now trades near 25.
"
463,COO,"Another is New York burger chain Shake Shack (SHAK), which raised $150 million in its Jan. 30 IPO. Shake Shack priced at 21, above its estimated range, and bolted 119% from there on its first day. It now trades near 74.
"
464,COO,"California-inspired burger joint Habit Restaurants (HABT) priced at 18, above the estimated range, and popped 120%, raising $90 million. It now trades near 34.

"
467,COO,"Potbelly (PBPB), the Chicago-based sandwich chain, surged 120% in its October 2013 IPO, ending the day at 30.77. It now trades near 14.
"
468,COO,"Other early winners in this category that have turned cold include Noodles & Co. (NDLS), which popped 104% in its June 2013 IPO but now trades below the offering price.
"
469,COO,"Wingstop looks to raise $99 million in its IPO, pricing 5.8 million shares with an estimated range of 16-18.
"
470,COO,"Restaurant valuations are high, which has attracted investors to the IPO field, hoping they can catch a ride on a fast-growing company, says Larry Miller, founder and CEO of restaurant industry research firm MillerPulse.
"
471,COO,"Those valuations are high because overall industry performance has been on an upward trend since 2013, thanks to a steadily improving economy.
"
472,COO,"""Same-store sales and traffic have continued to improve,"" said Miller. ""The restaurant IPO market is benefiting from improving fundamentals and good valuations.""
"
473,COO,"That's been broad-based, with the exception of McDonald's (MCD), he adds.
"
474,COO,"THE COMPANY
"
475,COO,"Founded in 1994, Wingstop says it pioneered the concept of wings as a center-of-the-plate feature. It claims to be the largest fast-casual chicken-wing focused restaurant chain, having sold approximately 4 billion wings in the past 20 years.
"
476,COO,"Wingstop has 745 restaurants in 37 states and six countries. Of those, 726, or 97%, are franchised, with just 19 company-owned stores. Its largest market presence is in Texas and California. It has 27 restaurants in Mexico. International locations also include Indonesia, the Philippines and Russia.
"
477,COO,"Wingstop offers three versions of chicken wings: boneless, bone-in and chicken strips, with 11 ""bold, distinctive and craveable flavors,"" including mango habanero, Cajun, Hawaiian, hickory-smoked BBQ and mild.
"
478,COO,"It also offers hand-cut, seasoned fries and sides made fresh daily.
"
479,COO,"Family packs are on the menu, the largest being a 100-piece package. Carry-out orders constitute approximately 75% of sales.
"
480,COO,"On top of all that is an online ordering service.
"
481,COO,"Restaurant industry magazine QSR listed Wingstop among its ""Best Franchise Deals"" of 2014.
"
482,COO,"Food & Wine magazine put Wingstop on its list of ""Best Chicken Wings"" in 2014.
"
483,COO,"""While other concepts include wings as add-on menu items or focus on wings in a bar or sports-centric setting, we are singularly focused on wings, fries and sides, which generate approximately 90% of our sales,"" the company said in its IPO prospectus filing.
"
484,COO,"The small menu that Wingstop offers sets it apart from Buffalo Wild Wings (BWLD), a giant in the field with sales last year of $1.6 billion. Sales at the sports bar and grill have climbed by double-digit percentages for 19 straight quarters. In addition to chicken wings, Buffalo Wild Wings has burgers, sandwiches, salads and beer — and much larger restaurants.
"
485,COO,"""Wingstop should not be considered to be another Buffalo Wild Wings,"" said John Gordon, principal at Pacific Management Consulting Group.
"
486,COO,"Wingstop says its customers are anchored by the sought-after demographic of 18-34-year-olds, which Wingstop says is a loyal group that dines at fast-casual restaurants more frequently.
"
487,COO,"RISK/CHALLENGES
"
488,COO,"The fast-casual restaurant arena is highly competitive.
"
489,COO,"The all-star in the group is Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), which came public in January 2006. Chipotle annual sales have grown by double-digit percentages 14 years in a row, which partly explains the enthusiasm for stocks in the sector.
"
490,COO,"""There's a tremendous amount of interest among investors to find another Chipotle,"" said Gordon.
"
491,COO,"It won't be easy to replicate Chipotle's success, he notes.
"
492,COO,"The challenge all restaurants face is that the market is saturated. Gordon estimates 1 million restaurants are in America. The plate is overflowing.
"
493,COO,"""Restaurants have grown faster than the population has grown,"" said Gordon. ""There's a supply and demand imbalance.""
"
494,COO,"But chicken's popularity works in Wingstop's favor.
"
495,COO,"""Chicken consumption has been tearing the heck out of beef consumption,"" Gordon said, with chicken getting hot in 1999.
"
496,COO,"THE RESULTS
"
497,COO,"Wingstop's same-store sales growth, an important measure of company performance, has been positive for 11 quarters. Domestic same-stores sales rose 10.7% year over year in the first quarter and 12.5% in the fourth quarter.
"
498,COO,"Revenue of $19 million in the first quarter was up 14% from the year-ago period, with net income of $2.55 million.
"
499,COO,"Revenue of $67.5 million in 2014 was up 14%, with net income of $9 million. Royalty revenue and franchise fees accounted for 56% of revenue.
"
500,COO,"Wingstop estimates there is opportunity to grow to 2,500 restaurants across the U.S., with ""significant international growth opportunity,"" saying it has 310 international restaurant commitments.
"
501,COO,"PROCEEDS
"
502,COO,"Of the 5.8 million shares being offered, 3.65 million are from current stockholders. Wingstop will not receive any proceeds from that sale. Of the remaining 2.15 million shares, based on an assumed price of 17 per share, Wingstop expects to receive proceeds of $30.9 million after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and other fees. It plans to use that to repay debt and for other general corporate purposes.

570,COO,"GoPro's (GPRO) first-quarter guidance was a no-no to investors, who sold off shares in the action camera maker on Friday.GoPro late Thursday reported fourth-quarter results that easily beat Wall Street's targets. But its earnings forecast was a little light, prompting the sell-off.For the quarter, GoPro earned 99 cents a share excluding items, up 200% from the year-earlier quarter, on sales of $634 million, up 75%. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected the maker of Hero-brand wearable cameras to earn 70 cents a share ex items on sales of $580 million.For Q1, GoPro expects earnings per share of 16 cents on sales of $335 million, based on the midpoint of its guidance. Wall Street was modeling 17 cents a share ex items, up 42%, on $325 million in sales, up 38%.Besides the EPS guidance miss, GoPro investors were shocked by the resignation of Chief Operating Officer Nina Richardson, who has been COO for two years. She is leaving effective Feb. 27 to pursue board roles and other opportunities, the company said.GoPro stock was down 10% to near 49 in midday trading on the stock market today.Since GoPro didn't guide Wall Street higher for Q1 earnings, investor attention has shifted to the lockup expiration on IPO shares coming on Feb. 17, Pacific Crest Securities analyst Brad Erickson said in a research report Thursday. He rates GoPro stock sector perform.FBN Securities analyst Shebly Seyrafi said investors were overreacting to the company's guidance and COO departure. He reiterated his outperform rating on the stock, but lowered his price target to 75 from 100.The company's Q1 EPS is expected to be at or slightly below consensus because of a forecast decline in GoPro's gross profit margin to 44.5% from 48% in Q4, he said in a report Friday. Profitability will slip this quarter because of lower sales volume and an expected increase in sales through international distributors, where margins are lower, he said.Seyrafi says GoPro is being conservative with its guidance.Last quarter, GoPro expanded in Brazil and took its first steps into China by hooking up with Web retailers Tmall.com, a unit of Alibaba (BABA), and JD.com (JD).Dougherty analyst Charles Anderson said he was impressed with GoPro's sales, but the company's valuation keeps him on the sidelines. He rates GoPro stock neutral.""We continue to believe GoPro has established itself as one of the most valuable brands in consumer technology and has significant headroom to grow as it expands overseas and extends the brand to new device categories,"" he said in a note Friday.Consumer drones for aerial photography would be a ""logical extension"" for the company, Anderson said.In an interview with Fortune on Thursday, GoPro CEO Nick Woodman declined to comment on whether GoPro would make its own drones.""What I can tell you (is) drones are great for GoPro, and GoPro is great for drones,"" Woodman said.

571,COO,"Amid concerns about user growth and engagement, microblog platform Twitter (TWTR) reached a deal to get its content in front of more non-registered users.Google (GOOGL) search results could be included in Twitter tweets in real time, starting later this year.In return, Twitter will receive an unspecified amount of data-licensing revenue, according to various media reports.Google and Twitter did not respond to emails seeking comment.But JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth said in a Thursday research note that the apparent ""renewed partnership ... does not come as a complete surprise given that Twitter indicated at its November 2014 analyst day that it had already begun letting search engines crawl its top 50,000 hashtags earlier in 2014.""Anmuth called the deal a ""positive for both companies"" that could help Twitter boost its registered user base while Google would gain a broader amount of content along with access to rapidly growing amounts of social and user-generated content.Yahoo, Bing And GoogleTwitter also provides data to No. 3 search firm Yahoo (YHOO) as well as Microsoft's (MSFT) Bing search service.According to Bloomberg, Twitter will provide its data directly to Google so that results appear more quickly and prominently on the world's No. 1 search engine. Currently, Google must get the information by going to Twitter's site.The two companies had a similar deal from 2009 to 2011, but the arrangement lapsed, Bloomberg said, because former Twitter COO Ali Rowghani wanted to keep more control over Twitter's content.Now engineers from Twitter and Google are working on the new version of the arrangement, Bloomberg said.Twitter stock was up 2.3% to 41.67 in afternoon trading on the stock market today.

Among those ""logged-off"" users, 75 million view search results and 125 million look at tweets, he said.""To drive more engagement for these users, Twitter plans to begin showcasing more content"" for them to see, Josey said. ""Improving the user experience . . . is Twitter's opportunity (for) significant monetization"" once it begins presenting those non-member ""logged-out"" users with ads, Josey says.Twitter faces competition for advertisers and users from Internet leaders including friendly foe Google as well as Facebook (FB) and up-and-comers like Snapchat, a service enabling people to send text and video messages that promptly disappear after being viewed.

""We believe ... that this level of sales force not only meets our needs currently, but also allows us the capability for continued growth,"" Howell said.When Angie's List CEO Bill Oesterle spoke to analysts during the company's Q2 earnings call on July 23, he said ""lackluster"" performance by the company's Big Deal segment had dragged down the company's overall revenue.Deeply discounted deals are not the ""strategic core of e-commerce business"" for Angie's List, Oesterle said at that time, adding that the company's ""emphasis has been and continues to be on Storefront, our web and mobile-based shopping experience.""Launched in 2010, the Big Deals product offers discounted products and services.

710,COO,"For most pharmaceutical companies, keeping a pipeline of new drugs filled is critical to success.
"
711,COO,"Steven Klosk, president and CEO of East Rutherford, N.J.-based Cambrex (CBM), specializes in developing a pipeline of new medications as an outsourcer for other pharmaceutical firms.
"
712,COO,"Creating a steady flow of new products to keep revenues spiking is one of a CEO's major tasks. Some say Klosk is a case study for this type of achievement.
"
713,COO,"Daniel Rizzo, a New York City-based industry analyst at Sidoti & Co., said Klosk ""consistently works with customers to determine their needs. The pipelines at Cambrex have been robust and look as if they will be robust for the next couple of years.""
"
714,COO,"Klosk says his most important role is ""setting the broad overall growth strategy of the business."" But he's keenly aware of the need for follow-through. ""History is littered with companies that have come up with great strategies and not executed,"" Klosk said.
"
715,COO,"To get strategic traction, Klosk says, it's paramount to communicate senior management's overall approach to staffers. He makes it a point to hold regular town meetings at Cambrex's six global locations in the U.S., Europe and India. He tells them: ""'Here's our strategy and why, here's how you fit in and why, here are our goals and objectives.' Then you repeat it so everyone gets to know it.""
"
716,COO,"Up From The Ranks
"
717,COO,"Klosk was named CEO of Cambrex in 2008, working his way up the corporate ladder. Previously, he served as vice president of administration and chief operating officer.
"
718,COO,"Two mentors at Cambrex guided his career: Jim Mack, the previous CEO, and Gary Mossman, the ex-COO. ""They allowed me to travel with them and help them manage the business,"" said Klosk, a native of New Hyde Park, N.Y., and graduate of Cornell University.
"
719,COO,"Klosk says Mack taught him how to make the most of commercial opportunities and prepare for customer meetings. He also learned how to understand business from a financial point of view, including income statements, balance sheets and cash flow.
"
720,COO,"Before starting at Cambrex, Klosk graduated from Manhattan's New York Law School. His legal training provided many of the requisite skills to serve as CEO.
"
721,COO,"Most CEOs are awash in data. But Klosk says his legal training allows him to deftly analyze the various business prospects and strategies that come across his desk. ""It gives you the ability to get to the core of the issue,"" he said.
"
722,COO,"Klosk admits it can be lonely at the top. He also sees one big difference when you move up to head a company. At lower managerial levels, he notes, ""people tell you things that for some reason they're less likely to when you're the CEO.""
"
723,COO,"As CEO, Klosk notices that ""people don't come to you until they've done 100% of their homework."" At lower levels, staffers tend to exchange fresher and more spontaneous information about how to win business and solve problems. Hence, Klosk relies on his senior management team to bubble up new ideas from the ranks and stresses the importance of listening to staff.
"
724,COO,"One of Cambrex's key roles is to serve as a ""custom developer"" for various pharmaceutical companies. It helps customers at a mostly late stage of pharmaceutical development gain patents and Food and Drug Administration approval.
"
725,COO,"""They hire us to make the molecules. We specialize in active pharmaceutical ingredients, which gives the molecules its efficacy,"" Klosk said.
"
726,COO,"""We're not placing a bet on our developing a new chemical process. We're attempting to win as an outsourcer, a manufacturing supplier for many late stage medications,"" he said.

727,COO,"To keep Cambrex's business pumped, Klosk said, ""The single most important factor to grow our business is new products.""
"
728,COO,"Fat Pipeline
"
729,COO,"Cambrex teams with pharmaceutical firms to develop new or innovative drugs and on researching generic drugs. Currently its pipeline is developing 15 to 20 generic medications, 12 new products, and 30 to 40 drugs are in the second phase of development.

"
731,COO,"""We're attempting to win as an outsourcer or manufacturing supplier for many late-stage customers,"" he said.
"
732,COO,"Cambrex often focuses on niche generic products. But with new innovative drugs, it searches for medications that affect wider audiences and produce more revenue.
"
733,COO,"For example, Cambrex partnered with Gilead Sciences (GILD) to develop a new hepatitis C drug called Solvadi. Analyst Rizzo says Solvadi has the potential to reach $3 billion in sales, far beyond the sales of most of Cambrex's generic drugs, which average about $3 million a year, he said.

741,COO,"Similar to wise buying decisions, exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns. Selling off losers can be difficult, but if both the share price and estimates are falling, it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio.One such stock that you may want to consider dropping is Cardinal Health, Inc. (CAH  -  Free Report), which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks, and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year. A Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) further confirms weakness in CAH.A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions. For the full year, we have seen seven estimates moving down in the past 30 days, compared with no upward revisions. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower, going from $5.41 a share a month ago to its current level of $5.09.Also, for the current quarter, Cardinal Health has seen six downward estimate revisions versus no revisions in the opposite direction, dragging the consensus estimate down to $1.03 a share from $1.31 over the past 30 days.  The stock also has seen some pretty dismal trading lately, as the share price has dropped 11.2% in the past month.Cardinal Health, Inc.

742,COO,"On May 2, we issued an updated research report on GNC Holdings, Inc. (GNC  -  Free Report). We are upbeat about the company’s strategies to strengthen international presence. However, cut-throat competition continues to pose a challenge. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).This leading global specialty retailer of products for health and wellness, including vitamins, minerals, herbal supplement, sports nutrition and diets, has been underperforming its industry over the past year. The company has lost 50.9% compared with the 21.4% decline of the industry.GNC Holdings exited the first quarter of 2018 on a dismal note with year-over-year decline in adjusted earnings and revenues. Additionally, in the United States, GNC Holdings competes with heavily advertised national brands of large pharmaceutical and food companies as well as other retailers. This leads to increased price competition for the company as more participants are entering the market. On a positive note, GNC Holdings’ international business has been a key driver of growth in recent years. Management expects to continue capitalizing on international revenue growth opportunities through the addition of franchise stores in existing markets, expansion into new high-growth markets and the growth of product distribution in both existing and new markets.In this regard, GNC Holdings recently announced the receipt of Hayao shareholders’ vote for the strategic partnership and China joint venture agreement with Harbin Pharmaceutical Group Holding (Hayao). Further, the company recently entered into a master franchise agreement with Rapid Nutrition to foray into Australia.At the same time, GNC Holdings has announced plans to expand presence in India where it operates in collaboration with the master franchise partner — Guardian Healthcare Services Pvt. Ltd. All these developments help boost investors’ faith in the stock.Also, the company has progressed significantly through its e-commerce business.

743,COO,"On Mar 13, we issued an updated research report on The Cooper Companies (COO  -  Free Report). The company carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Cooper Companies maintained its leading position in the specialty lens market, supported by exclusive products like Biofinity and Clariti. However, intense competition in the contact lens space will continue to build pressure on pricing.The company’s flagship silicone hydrogel lenses are expected to see strong sales in the coming quarters. In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, revenues increased on the back of silicone hydrogel lenses, led by the Clariti and MyDay in the dailies space and Biofinity in the monthly space.The company is also focusing on expanding geographically. The launch of MyDay Toric daily disposable contact lenses in the United States is in line with this. Management believes that the Toric market will grow faster than the overall market and the company can cash in on the opportunity with its strong portfolio and the recent addition of MyDay Toric. Moreover, Cooper Companies’ CooperVision segment is one of the key drivers. The segment gains from silicone hydrogel lenses, led by solid prospects in MyDay, Clariti and Biofinity platforms. The outlook for the contact lens industry is favorable. We are encouraged to note that the Cooper Companies is progressing well with respect to inorganic expansion. In a bid to boost inorganic growth, Cooper Companies announced that CooperVision has completed the buyout of Paragon Vision Sciences in the fourth quarter of 2017.Shares of Cooper Companies have gained 21.7% in the past year, outperforming the industry’s gain of 13.3%.On the flip side, Cooper Companies operates in a highly competitive market.

746,COO,"Cooper Companies Inc. (COO  -  Free Report) reported adjusted earnings of $2.65 in fourth-quarter fiscal 2017, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny and improved 16% year over year. We believe that the upside was driven by robust revenue growth. The stock flaunts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Revenues increased 8% on a year-over-year basis to $561.5 million. The figure also outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $558 million. The stellar top-line performance was driven by innovative products like Biofinity and daily silicone hydrogel lenses.Segmental AnalysisThe company has two business segments — CooperVision (CVI) and CooperSurgical (CSI).Revenues at CooperVision Segment increased 7% at constant currency (cc) to $439 million on a year-over-year basis. The segment continues to gain from the company’s silicone hydrogel lenses led by solid prospects in the MyDay, Clariti and Biofinity platforms. Coming to the major catalysts within the CVI segment, robust performance by Toric (31% of CVI revenues), Multifocal (10.3%), single-use sphere lenses (27%) and non single-use sphere lenses (31.7%) propelled solid growth.Multifocal revenues rose 4% at cc to $45.1 million, while Toric revenues increased 7% at cc to $136 million year over year. Single-use sphere lenses sales climbed 8% at cc to $118.9 million, while sales of non single-use sphere lenses were flat at $139 million year over year.Geographically, CVI revenues inched up 2% in the Americas, while revenues from the Asia Pacific and EMEA rose 10% and 5% respectively, at cc.Revenues at CooperSurgical Segment jumped 7% at cc to $122.5 million on a year-over-year basis. The fertility category (55% of CSI revenues) witnessed a 12% rise at cc in sales in the reported quarter, totaling $66.8 million. However, the office and surgical products category inched up 2% at cc to $55.7 million.Cooper Companies, Inc. (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Cooper Companies, Inc. (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Cooper Companies, Inc. (The) QuoteMargin DetailsAs a percentage of revenues, adjusted gross margin at the CSI segment was 59.6% in the reported quarter, down 290 basis points (bps) year over year. The margins were offset by lower pricing from genetic testing within the Fertility segment and inventory adjustments on legacy products.As a percentage of revenues, adjusted gross margin at the CVI segment was 67.7% in the reported quarter, higher than 64.8% of revenues in the year-ago quarter. Favorable currency and product mix boosted margins at the segment.Hence, adjusted gross margin as a whole for Cooper Companies in the reported quarter was 65.9% of revenues, up 160 bps year over year.Adjusted operating margin, as a percentage of revenues, was 27.2% of net revenues in the fiscal fourth quarter, up 210 bps on a year-over-year basis. Both CVI and CSI registered strong operating margin improvement in the quarter.FY17 Results at a GlanceCooper Companies reported revenues of $2,139 million in fiscal 2017, up 7% at cc on a year-over-year basis. CVI revenues were $1,674.1 million, up 7% at cc, and CSI revenues were $464.9 million, up 4% at cc.Adjusted earnings for fiscal 2017 were $9.70, up 15% year over year.GuidanceFor fiscal 2018, total revenues are expected in the band of $2,480-$2,530 million.Revenues at the CVI segment are estimated in the range of $1,830-$1,865 million, while CSI revenues are projected in the range of $650-$665 million. Meanwhile, adjusted earnings are anticipated in the band of $11.35-$11.65 per share. Cooper Companies expects fiscal 2018 gross margins to improve around 68%. Operating margins are expected to improve around 28% of net revenues.Our TakeCooper Companies ended fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 on a solid note, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both lines. The company has always witnessed impressive results at CooperVision business segment. The CooperSurgical segment also delivered strong sales in the fourth quarter, buoyed by robust Toric performance. The company provided strong guidance for fiscal 2018. However, intense competition in the contact lens space will continue to increase pricing pressure for the company.Notably, Cooper Companies has completed the acquisition of Paragon Vision Sciences earlier this month. This added a leading ortho-k technology to the company’s lens portfolio. According to the company, this buyout is likely to prove neutral to earnings per share in fiscal 2018, excluding one-time charges and deal-related amortization. Considering the outstanding performance of the stock, we expect Cooper Companies to scale higher in the coming quarters. In this regard, positive long-term growth of 10.8% holds promise.Key PicksSome other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are PetMed Express, Inc.

747,COO,"H&R Block Inc. (HRB  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results before the market opens on Dec 6. The company has a positive earnings surprise history, beating estimates thrice in the trailing four quarters with an average surprise of 11.4%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Key Factors to ConsiderH&R Block is continuing with its aggressive client expansion policy with compelling promotions and product offers. At the same time, the company is actively investing in innovative solutions that leverage its ability to better serve customers through customized products. These include a redesigned website to file taxes anywhere on the go, high security standards to prevent tax identity theft and enhanced security features to safeguard taxpayer information. With such core business focus, the company anticipates providing improved services to its existing clientele while attracting newer ones to augment revenues.As part of the nationwide program for health care exchange enrollment, H&R Block partnered GoHealth Insurance whereby its clients can purchase health care insurance online or over the phone through licensed GoHealth agents. GoHealth thus helped H&R Block foray into the health insurance brokerage business. This, in turn, will open up additional revenue-generating opportunities for the company.Furthermore, H&R Block has collaborated with BofI Federal Bank, wherein the latter would become the exclusive refund advance provider for its customers. The Refund Advance program continues to be a valuable product for the early season clients, who are looking to access their refund faster. Also, it supplements its Tax Plus product suite, which is the most robust in the industry.However, the performance of the company is tied to the overall health of the economy. With stressed economic environment, the overall tax filing market is expected to be under pressure. As a result, we expect the impending quarterly earnings to remain stressed.In addition, H&R Block faces huge litigations in connection with its various operating activities. It is exposed to employment related lawsuits in various parts of the country and compliance fee litigation in Missouri state and federal courts. Such litigations weigh on investor sentiments and hamper the company’s goodwill. Moreover, its debt-to-equity ratio compares unfavorably with the sector’s average. Additionally, the cash position of the company is fluctuating in nature. This raises skepticism about its ability to engage in de-leveraging activities.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that H&R Block is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and Zacks Consensus Estimate, is 0.00%.

QuoteZacks Rank: H&R Block has a Zacks Rank #3. While this increases the predictive power of ESP, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Dollar General Corporation (DG  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.89% and Zacks Rank #2.

748,COO,"The Cooper Companies Inc.’s (COO  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results, scheduled for release on Dec 7, are expected to show steady growth in CooperVision Segment or CVI — one of the major revenue components. While this could majorly drive fourth-quarter earnings, an expected improvement in revenues at other segments should help the company generate solid results.It is important to note that Cooper’s last quarter earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.3%. Similar to the prior quarter, strong growth in non single-use sphere lenses and single-use sphere lenses are expected to be the main factors driving CVI revenues.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CVI stands at $441 million for the fourth quarter. This reflects an increase of almost 7% from the year-ago quarter. Year-over-year growth across CooperSurgical or CSI and Fertility segments also hold promise for Cooper.Delving deeper into the fundamentals of the stock, let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this release.Key Factors to Influence Q4View Upbeat: For the fourth quarter, Cooper expects revenues in the range of $552 million to $565 million. CVI revenues are expected between $435 million and $445 million, while CSI revenues are anticipated between $117 million and $120 million. The company expects adjusted earnings per share between $2.60 and $2.70.Furthermore, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings stands at $2.66 per share, up 16.6% year over year. The estimate for revenues is pegged at $559.1 million, up 7.8% year over year. Cooper Companies, Inc. (The) Price and EPS Surprise  Cooper Companies, Inc. (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Cooper Companies, Inc. (The) Quote Robust CSI Product Portfolio: Cooper is well positioned to benefit from the expanding CSI product portfolio. The company's presence in the markets of Spain, the U.K., Japan, Peru, South America, the UAE, South Africa, Jordan and Taiwan is worth a mention. In an initiative to bolster its CSI portfolio, the company recently announced an asset-purchase agreement to acquire the flagship contraception platform of Israel-based Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA) — PARAGARD Intrauterine Device. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CSI revenues stands at $118 million, up 10.3% year over year.Fertility Segment to Drive Growth: We believe that strong performance in the fertility segment would drive Cooper’s top line. The company’s focus on genetic testing is also expected to continue to drive growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s revenues stands at $64 million, up 23% year over year.However, volatile foreign exchange is likely to hurt results in the quarter to be reported.Our quantitative model projects an earnings beat for Cooper this quarter.

749,COO,"A lot has been said about the President’s latest and most-controversial $1.5 trillion tax move and its impact on the economy once it’s passed. So far, the reaction of the hoi polloi has been mixed with people in favor of the Republicans treating the latest move as a big stimulant for economic growth that could offset any financial deficit. According to them, this new system will replace the existing “complicated, antiquated, and unfair” tax code that has not been updated for more than 30 years.Opponents, however, slammed the new plan as a 'job killer'. Per a report by The New York Times, “critics say a deficit-financed tax cut is at odds with longstanding Republican calls for fiscal discipline, including that tax cuts not add to the ballooning federal deficit. The federal debt topped $20 trillion earlier this month and is projected to grow by another $10 trillion over the next decade.”No Talk on MedTech Tax RepealThere is still lack of clarity in the MedTech space, which is unable to gauge the impending impact of the latest tax bill. In this regard, we note that the community was extremely hopeful about Trump’s regulatory agenda as it promised the abolition of the infamous 2.3% medical device tax.The dreaded tax, commonly addressed as 'fund of the ACA', dealt a heavy blow to the medical device industry since its enactment in 2013. This tax, imposed on the selling price instead of net profit and amounting to a stupendous sum, wiped out almost a quarter of the profit of medical technology companies. Realizing this, the U.S. House and Senate temporarily suspended it for two years at the beginning of 2015.Going by the available data,  it is quite evident that this partial two-year repeal of the medical device tax has benefited the sector’s overall development. Per data provided by the medical device trade group (in a Ken Blackwell article published by The Daily Caller), within this period, there was roughly an 83% rise in research and development (R&D) investments by MedTech players.The Republicans’ current stance of being tightlipped about this tax increases the probability of its return in 2018. Undoubtedly, its comeback will be an additional burden for the MedTech fraternity, largely discouraging R&D activities.Dental Bears the Brunt TooThe condition of the U.S. dental industry (a significant part of the Medical device space) is equally bad. Notably, this sector posted a stellar performance on the bourse over the last five years, gaining 103.6% and outperforming the S&P 500’s gain of just 87%.Unfortunately, given the political challenges, the performance of the industry has deteriorated and over the last two years, it has gained just 11.8%, much lower than the S&P 500’s gain of almost 25%. Furthermore, a discouraging broader industry rank (among Bottom 31% of more than 250 industries) indicates persisting concerns for the dental space. We also note that this industry’s projected earnings per share growth rate is 8.7%, lower than the S&P 500’s 9.8%.4 Dental Stocks to Bet OnOwing to the adversities, market watchers have adopted a bearish stance toward the dental space. At present, only four dental stocks are expected to beat the ongoing MedTech blues. Apart from a strong Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), these stocks are witnessing favorable estimate revisions. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks hereAlign Technology, Inc.

Align’s recent slew of product development, continued growth observed across all channels and the company’s consistent focus on international markets to drive growth boost our confidence in the stock.Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimate revisions have been promising. For the current year, eight estimates have gone up in the past 60 days with no movement in the opposite direction. This had positive impact on the Zacks Consensus Estimate, which increased by 3 cents in the past two months.Align Technology, Inc. Price and Consensus Align Technology, Inc.

This $1.1-billion cash transaction will bolster the company’s CooperSurgical business segment in the contraceptive device market. Furthermore, the outlook for the contact lens industry is favorable, which is likely to boost the stock over the long haul.Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimate revisions have been favorable.

750,COO,"The latest $1.5-trillion tax reform plan has been a landmark achievement for President Trump. As usual, in its initial stage, the nation gave mixed reactions on the controversial bill. While a few Americans slammed the new plan as a ‘job killer,' others found it to be ‘an excellent opportunity to fix a broken tax code.'While the bill claims to primarily focus on the easing of tax woes for middle-class Americans, the massive cut in corporate taxes tells a different story altogether. In fact, a research report by CNBC reveals that Frank Clemente, executive director of Americans for Tax Fairness, slammed the new tax code as a ""a big giveaway to millionaires and corporations,"" neglecting the ones who are in real need of it.Now, it is to be seen whether the bill is fated to meet an overall failure or it gets to fulfill its promises of ‘inclusive economic growth’.What’s in it for MedTech?“They are cutting taxes on the wealthy and taking health care away from millions,” — Senate Democratic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.Customer Base to ShrinkWhile the reduction in corporate taxes will encourage the development of expensive cutting-edge MedTech products, the question over its profitability looms large. This is because with a higher number of uninsured and lesser deductions on healthcare costs, the industry is likely to witness a shrinking customer base, indicating a decline in demand for expensive medical procedures and devices.Tax Decision on MedTech Devices ImpendingThe MedTech community has been hopeful since Trump proposed policies that entailed the abolition of the infamous 2.3% medical device sales tax. Such high taxes forced companies to lay off employees, limit research and development activities, and reduce capital investment.Furthermore, AdvaMed, a leading American medical device trade association, had referred to the medical device tax as a ‘significant drag on medical innovation’. Notably, small device companies suffered the most. Amid such worries, a repeal of the tax paradigm is expected to resume an aggressive pace of hiring and investment among the 9,000 America-based medical device manufacturers, instilling investor confidence in the stocks.Per data provided by the medical device trade group (in a Ken Blackwell article published by The Daily Caller), the partial two-year repeal of the MedTech tax had resulted in a roughly 83% rise in research and development (R&D) investments by MedTech players. The comeback of the tax in 2018 will lead to a $15 billion rise in taxes, largely discouraging R&D activities. Undoubtedly, the future of the U.S. MedTech industry depends on the Republicans’ decision on the 2.3% medical device tax.Key PicksPer Trump, the democrats have established a “lousy healthcare” model. However, with a complete medical device tax renovation, it is being widely believed that a new set of streamlined rules will benefit the medical device space.Meanwhile, stocks with strong fundamentals will give you assured returns amid this tax conundrum. We have zeroed in on five stocks that sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and boast strong fundamentals. Notably, all these stocks promise long-term expected earnings growth rate of 10% or more.IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. (IDXX  -  Free Report)Headquartered in Delaware, NJ, IDEXX is a developer, manufacturer and distributer of products and services, primarily for the companion animal veterinary, livestock and poultry, water testing and dairy markets.

The company also witnessed favorable tidings at the regulatory front in the third quarter. In this regard, the recent CE-IVD mark for the ARIES Norovirus Assay, the FDA approval of ARIES C. difficile Assay and the reimbursement approval of VERIGENE assay in Japan are noteworthy. Luminex is on the verge of completing its clinical study for Group A Strep and is close to submitting the same for FDA review.The stock has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 16.3%.

The company’s flagship product — Signal Extraction (SET) Pulse Oximetry — is used to monitor blood oxygen saturation levels and protect against hypoxemia and hyperoxemia.We believe the company's expanding product portfolio will be a key catalyst. Wider adoption of its non-invasive patient monitoring technology will help the company gain traction.

A strong summer season performance drove Invisalign growth in the global teen market. We are also upbeat about the company’s signing of a distribution agreement with Patterson Dental. The company’s receipt of two U.S. patents for SmartTrack InvisAlign Aligner material buoys optimism as well.Align has a Zacks Rank #1, and promises long-term expected earnings growth of 28.9%.

Notably, the segment banks on the MyDay, Clariti and Biofinity silicone hydrogel lenses platforms. The CooperSurgical segment also delivered strong sales in the quarter. A strong guidance for fiscal 2017 instills our confidence in the stock. Cooper recently completed the acquisition of Procornea. This added a leading ortho-k technology to Cooper’s lens portfolio and marked its foray into the emerging myopia controlled markets.The stock has a Zacks Rank #2 and an expected earnings growth rate of 10.8%.

Price and Consensus | The Cooper Companies, Inc. QuoteThe company delivered an average earnings surprise of 6.1% in the trailing four quarters. Also, the expected long-term earnings growth of 10.8% looks promising. Let’s find out whether the company can maintain the recent positive trend.Cooper Companies’ CooperVision segment is the key growth driver. The segment gains from the silicone hydrogel lenses, led by solid prospects in MyDay, Clariti and Biofinity platforms. In fact, the company’s flagship silicone hydrogel lenses are expected to deliver strong sales in the upcoming quarters.The company has initiated the process of introducing MyDay lenses in the domestic market. It is already available in Europe and has gained significant traction within a short span. Clariti lenses also hold significant growth prospects for the company.The outlook for the contact lens industry is favorable.

752,COO,"ResMed Inc. (RMD  -  Free Report) recently demonstrated a favorable outcome from two clinical analyses in the field of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). These studies were conducted for the United Kingdom and the United States, highlighting the cost effectiveness of combining home oxygen therapy with home non-invasive ventilation (NIV) therapy for persistent hypercapnia patients, who suffer exacerbation of COPD.The combo regimen of Home Oxygen Therapy-Home Mechanical Ventilation (a home NIV), together known as HOT-HMV, has been presented at the American Thoracic Society 2018 International Conference. These are company-sponsored health economic studies.Going by the U.K. study, HOT-HMV treatment reduced exacerbation frequency and 28-day hospital readmission. Data from the analysis was used to develop an economic model from the U.K. National Health Service perspective. While the U.S. study demonstrated a 58.3% reduction in 30-day readmissions for HOT-HMV patients compared with those on home oxygen alone. Evidently, this indicated the treatment to be hugely cost effective. Per ResMed, the U.S. analysis was based on the U.K. study. The study finds were utilized to build an economic model from the U.S. payer perspective.  We are optimistic about this entire development by ResMed, taking into consideration the widely growing market for COPD treatment. Per data provided by GBI Research, the global COPD market is currently worth $11.3 billion and is projected to reach a value of $15.6 billion by 2019. According to the research report, this gaping demand will be met through numerous new, efficient and convenient products making inroads into the market.  Undoubtedly, ResMed’s HOT-HMV studies and the related favorable outcomes are a step forward for the company to intensify its footprint in the niche market.Notably, ResMed achieved strong global revenue growth over the past few quarters, led by sales of sleep devices, respiratory care devices, mask systems as well as software solutions. We believe, ResMed’s product launches and strategies will gain traction in the SDB market and are expected to drive growth for the company in the near term.Among recent developments, the company informed about its first self-branded portable oxygen concentrator Mobi, subject to a fiscal third-quarter launch. It has also introduced AirMini, the world's smallest PAP (positive airway pressure) device.In the past three months, ResMed has outperformed its industry. The stock has gained 9% compared with the 5.1% rise of the industry.Zacks Rank & Key PicksResMed currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

753,COO,"On May 16, we issued an updated research report on QIAGEN N.V. (QGEN  -  Free Report). We are upbeat about the company progressing with the testing menu expansion strategy. However, a tough competitive landscape is a concern. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).This Netherlands-based molecular diagnostics provider offers innovative technologies and products for pre-analytical sample preparation and molecular diagnostics solutions. The stock has been outperforming its industry over the past six months. Per the latest stock movement, it has gained 12.2% against 8.1% decline of the broader industry.QIAGEN ended the first quarter on a solid note. We are impressed with the year-over-year growth in majority of the segments. The company has been proceeding with its test menu expansion strategy. In this regard, in April, the company announced the receipt of pre-market approval by the FDA for PartoSure. In the same month, the company launched QIAstat-Dx in Europe following the closure of the recently-announced Stat-Dx acquisition and completion of defined development activities by Stat-Dx. We are also upbeat about QIAGEN’s Molecular Diagnostics sales that have been growing significantly. During the first quarter, the company witnessed double-digit CER growth in revenues from the QuantiFERON latent TB test along with strength in Personalized Healthcare following rising sales of infectious disease testing products.We also look forward to the implementation of the recently-drawn strategies to boost top-line contributions from the NGS portfolio.Meanwhile, QIAGEN faces stiff competition from firms that provide competitive pre-analytical solutions and other products. The markets for some of the company’s products are very competitive and price sensitive, which add to the concerns.Also, strong reliance on collaborations and declining HPV sales in the United States are other negatives.A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Intuitive Surgical (ISRG  -  Free Report), Illumina, Inc (ILMN  -  Free Report) and The Cooper Companies, Inc.

The company’s CAD/CAM imaging platform is expected to boost results in the quarter to be reported and improvement in other units are tailwinds as well.In the last reported quarter, DENTSPLY posted adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 82 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. However, the metric declined 22.4% year over year. Net sales increased to $1,091 million from $996.5 million in the year-ago quarter. Also, the figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1056.0 million and rose 5.3% at constant-currency (cc) exchange rate.Currently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in the quarter to be reported is pegged at 42 cents per share, reflecting a decline of 14.3% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for net sales is projected at $944.7 million, showing an improvement of 4.9% year over year.Let’s delve into major factors that will influence DENTSPLY performance in the quarter to be reported.What to Expect From DENTSPLY in Q1?The company’s CAD/CAM unit is likely to drive the top line in the first quarter.

At present, there are 30-plus sales force and close to 5,800 people employed globally in sales and sales-support.In the quarter to be reported, R&D prospects and innovations will be other growth drivers. Recently, the company announced its plan to redirect industry-leading R&D budget toward high-impact projects that provide a better competitive position.DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc.

755,COO,"DaVita Inc.’s (DVA  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 results are scheduled to release on May 3, after the market closes. DaVita’s Dialysis and related lab services business segment has been a consistent driver of revenues for the company. Surging acquisition of dialysis centers also adds to the positives.Notably, in the fourth quarter of 2017, the company reported adjusted operating earnings of 92 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 91 cents. However, earnings declined 6.1% on a year-over-year basis.Meanwhile, revenues in the last reported quarter increased 3% year over year to $2.78 billion but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.89 billion.For the quarter under review, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $2.96 billion, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 20%. The same for earnings per share is projected at 92 cents, indicating year-over-year growth of 16.5%. The company delivered an average negative earnings surprise of 3.5% in the trailing four quarters.DaVita Inc. Price and EPS Surprise DaVita Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | DaVita Inc. QuoteLet’s delve into other factors that are likely to impact DaVita’s first-quarter 2018 results.Kidney Care Business & Dialysis Centers to Drive Q1DaVita Medical Group & Kidney Care, also known as DMG, provides integrated care management as an operating division of the company and focuses on delivering healthcare through a broad range of services.In 2017, Kidney Care business witnessed several prospects. Adjusted operating income in the segment was $1.616 billion, up from the adjusted guidance of $1.57-$1.6 billion in 2017. Lately, the company, in collaboration with Texas-based Methodist Specialty and Transplant Hospital, announced the launch of the Transplant Waitlist Support Program. The aim is to help keep waitlisted patients transplant-ready by deploying a technology-enabled solution.Developments like these are likely to help DaVita in registering solid quarterly results.In fourth-quarter 2017, DaVita acquired nine dialysis centers, opened 36 new centers and closed four in the United States. DaVita also acquired six dialysis centers, opened two centers and closed one center outside the United States. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the number of dialysis centers in the current quarter is pegged at 2.686, down 2.2% sequentially.Other Factors at PlayGuidanceFor 2018, the company projects Kidney Care consolidated operating income in the range of $1.5-$1.6 billion. Operating cash flow from continuing operations is estimated in the band of $1.4-$1.6 billion.The effective tax rate is expected in the range of 26.5-27.5%.A solid guidance such as this raises optimism in the company’s upcoming quarterly results.ReimbursementsCalcimimetics, a drug used to treat mineral bone disease, just moved into dialysis reimbursement with introduction of an injectable drug called Presibib.Though it is early to understand the full picture, the management is optimistic about its probable contributions to the quarterly results.Acquisition PerilsWith surging labor cost inflation, DaVita is likely to witness solid margin pressure in the traditional Medicare fee-for-service business.The series of acquisitions of dialysis centers by DaVita may affect operations, debt-to-capital ratio, capital expenditures or other aspects of the business.Further, joint ventures and minority investments inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations, thereby potentially increasing the financial, legal, operational and compliance risks associated with the joint venture or minority investment.Our ModelOur quantitative model predicts an earnings beat for DaVIta in the upcoming quarterly results.This is because a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates.

756,COO,"Inogen Inc.’s (INGN  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 results are scheduled for release on Apr 30, after the market closes. A broadening Long-term Oxygen Therapy (“LTOT”) market, inherent benefits of Portable Oxygen Concentrators (“POC”) over traditional delivery model, direct-to-customer business model, underpenetrated international markets and expanding product portfolio are key growth catalysts.Notably, in the last  quarter, Inogen reported adjusted earnings of 31 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 47.6%. Earnings increased 24% on a year-over-year basis. Total revenues in the reported quarter rose 25.4% to $63.8 million on a year-over-year basis. The figure beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.9%.For the current quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $62.6 million, reflecting a rise of 19.2% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 27 cents.Let’s delve into other factors which are likely to impact Inogen’s first-quarter 2018 results.European Sales to Boost Q1 Top LineInogen has been one of the leading providers of POCs in Europe. In the last-reported quarter, sales in Europe represented 84.3% of international sales, up from 83.3% in the year-ago quarter.We expect the trend to continue in the upcoming quarterly results. In fact, management expects long-term opportunity ahead as the market transitions from tank and liquid oxygen systems to non-delivery solutions.Further, in support of its European customers, Inogen began the production of its Inogen One G3 concentrators in the fourth quarter of 2017 using a contract manufacturer, Foxconn, located in the Czech Republic.In 2018, the company expects Foxconn to produce a huge number of Inogen One G3 concentrators required to support the massive European demand, with the first quarter being no exception.Although Inogen is just in the first leg of its collaboration with Foxconn, the company has been already delivering improved service levels and lower costs.We expect the company to deliver a solid first-quarter 2018 performance on the back of Inogen One concentrators and Inogen At Home concentrators. Inogen, Inc Price and EPS Surprise  Inogen, Inc Price and EPS Surprise | Inogen, Inc Quote Other Factors at PlayGuidanceFor 2018, Inogen expect revenues in the range of $298 million to $308 million, up from the previously-issued range of $295 million to $305 million. Notably, this represents growth of 19.5% to 23.5% year over year. An upbeat trend is expected to continue in the quarter to be reported as well.Direct-to-Consumer ModelInogen expects its direct-to-consumer sales to be the fastest growing channel, domestic business-to-business sales to have a significant growth rate and international business-to-business sales to have a modest growth rate where the strategy will still focus on the European market.Inogen’s direct-to-customer business model has lent it a leading position in the oxygen therapy market. The direct-to-consumer model gives companies an opportunity to build a unique brand relationship directly with customers. Recently, the company signed a lease for its expansion site in Ohio to accelerate growth in domestic direct-to-consumer sales channel. The growing direct-to-customer sales and marketing efforts help in increasing awareness among patients. Growth in physician referrals in this segment is expected to boost the top line over the long term.In the fourth quarter of 2017, direct-to-consumer sales (domestic and international) increased 23.9% to $29.5 million on a year-over-year basis. The company’s sales team consisted of 263 inside sales representatives as of Dec, 2017 which represented an increase of 86 reps over the 2016 year-end’s total of 177. The company announced plans to execute a direct-to-consumer pricing trial in 2018 to ensure that its products are optimally priced.A unique direct-to-consumer business model is likely to boost the company’s first-quarter bottom line.Dull Rental RevenuesInogen derives a significant portion of its revenues from Medicare’s service reimbursement programs. The company expects rental revenues per patient to decline in the upcoming quarters, due to lower reimbursement rates in connection with the nationalization of competitive bidding and continued reimbursement declines.Rental revenues represented 8.5% of total revenues in the fourth quarter of 2017, lower than 16.2% of net revenues in the year-ago quarter. Rental revenues in the fourth quarter of 2017 were $5.4 million compared with $8.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, down 34.1% year over year. Per management, the decline was caused by a $2-million rental benefit in the year-ago quarter.What Our Model PredictsOur quantitative model does not predict an earnings beat for Inogen in the upcoming quarterly results.This is because a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates.

757,COO,"AmerisourceBergen Corporation’s (ABC  -  Free Report) second-quarter fiscal 2018 results, scheduled for release on May 2, are expected to show steady growth in the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment, a significant contributor to revenues.In the last reported quarter, the company posted adjusted earnings of $1.55 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.35 and improving 14% year over year. The upside was attributed to strong growth in the company’s Pharmaceutical Distribution Segment and World Courier business. Revenues improved almost 6% to $40.47 billion in the previous quarter and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $40.37 billion.For the quarter to be reported, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $40.49 billion, reflecting a rise of 9% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $1.83, indicating an increase of 3.4% year over year.Let’s dig deeper to analyze how things are shaping up before the earnings announcements.Pharmaceutical Distribution to Boost Q2 ResultsPharmaceutical Distribution accounted for 96.2% of total revenues in the last quarter. Revenues in the segment were $38.94 billion, up 5.8% on a year-over-year basis. Operating income was $388.2 million, up 2.4% year over year.For the upcoming quarterly results, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Pharmaceutical Distribution segment is pegged at $38.88 billion. The figure reflects an increase of 9.5% from the year-ago figure.Strong organic growth rates in the U.S. pharmaceutical market, improving patient access to medical care, improved economic conditions and population demographics, introduction of new innovative drugs like hepatitis C drugs along with a consistent good brand-pricing environment should drive growth for AmerisourceBergen in the quarter to be reported.AmerisourceBergen Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  AmerisourceBergen Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | AmerisourceBergen Corporation QuoteMoreover, the company’s focus on specialty drugs bodes well. Per the IMS, pharmaceutical sales are estimated to grow approximately 7.1% annually over a five-year period through 2020, courtesy of strong demand, favorable pricing and new product introductions.The deals signed by AmerisourceBergen look encouraging, which are likely to boost the top line. The company entered into a strategic agreement with Walgreen Boots Alliance. The deal includes a 10-year pharmaceutical distribution contract, under which the company will distribute branded and generic pharmaceutical products to Walgreens.However, the segment is likely to be affected by lower-than-expected production at PharMEDium's Memphis 503B outsourcing facility. Notably, operations in the facility were voluntarily suspended by the company in the last quarter following a few inspections by the FDA.Other Factors to ConsiderGenerics & Product Launches to Drive Growth: We believe that AmerisourceBergen will benefit from generics growth in the long run. In the last quarter, AmerisourceBergen marked its 16th consecutive quarter with 10% or greater revenue growth in the business. Management confirmed that its strategic and focused effort is driving generic product volume growth to offset historic deflation rates.However, it's important to highlight that AmerisourceBergen will have about a 25% increase in quarterly interest expense beginning from the second quarter.Operational Efficiencies: The recent U.S. tax legislation has enhanced AmerisourceBergen’s ability to invest in business, innovate and deliver value to its shareholders. Over the long term, this enables AmerisourceBergen to boost its U.S. business.Recently, the company made strategic investments in IT systems to realize greater operational efficiency and increase operating leverage. This is likely to boost the company's results in the second quarter.In fact, AmerisourceBergen also announced its plans to roll out eight new IT systems and a new e-commerce platform at MWI. These should enhance the company’s results in the quarter to be reported.Guidance: Based upon the expectations from the recently legislated U.S. tax reform, AmerisourceBergen raised guidance for fiscal 2018. Notably, AmerisourceBergen’s strong guidance for fiscal 2018 indicates that the company expects to deliver solid results from the second quarter itself.The company expects adjusted earnings per share in the range of $6.45-$6.65, up from the previously range of $5.90-$6.15. Revenue growth for fiscal 2018 is expected in the range of 8-11%, up from the previous band of 7-9%.PharMEDium Slows Down: Recently, AmerisourceBergen received a grand jury subpoena from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Tennessee for documents about its lab testing of a certain type of syringe made at its PharMEDium lab in Memphis, which is the company’s largest highly automated production facility. As a result of the subpoena, AmerisorceBergen suspended operations and recalled all of the products that had yet to expire. In fact, the FDA also visited this facility for the same reason. Sluggishness in this unit is likely to hamper the company’s specialty distribution segment in the quarter to be reported.In the last reported quarter, the segment's results were negatively impacted by PharMEDium, wherein the company had lower-than-expected revenues and profit contribution.Per management, because of the time and certain ongoing incremental expenses required to perform remedial measures, PharMEDium's contribution to adjusted EBIT and EPS in the second quarter will be lower than anticipated.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not show an earnings beat for AmerisourceBergen in the second quarter. This is because a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: AmerisourceBergen has an Earnings ESP of -1.55%.

Solid performance by the Pharmacy Benefit Management segment (“PBM”) is likely to drive the company’s top line. However, the company is getting acquired by Cigna Corporation by the end of 2018.In the last reported quarter, Express Scripts delivered adjusted earnings of $2.16 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.08.

The company has been consistently trying to expand its core PBM business.

Express Scripts also distributes a full range of biopharmaceutical products and provides extensive cost-management and patient-care services.The company inked an agreement to acquire privately-held eviCore healthcare at $3.6 billion in October 2017.

The acquisition is expected to prove accretive to Express Scripts’ adjusted diluted earnings per share within the first full year of operation, the first quarter being no exception.Express Scripts Holding Company Price and EPS Surprise  Express Scripts Holding Company Price and EPS Surprise | Express Scripts Holding Company QuoteExpress Scripts' PBM services coupled with eviCore's complementary medical benefits management is likely to build a solution.Strong demand for the company’s solutions continued into the quarter under review. The company expects solid demand for SafeGuardRx, 90-day supply for chronic medications, exclusive Accredo Specialty Pharmacy and advanced opioid solutions. Through each of these programs as well as many others, Express Scripts delivers superior care to patients at an affordable cost.The company’s latest offering of Multiple Sclerosis Care Value Program has been launched on Jan 1. This program extends the company’s differentiated payment model by shielding payers from costs associated with discontinued therapy. Express Scripts already enrolled over 22 million lives as of yet. Management claims this as the most successful launch till date.Other Factors to ConsiderGuidance: Adjusted claims for the first quarter of 2018 are expected in the range of 335-345 million. Adjusted earnings per share for the first quarter of 2018 are estimated in the range of $1.73-$1.78. This represents growth of 30-34% on a year-over-year basis.For the full year, adjusted earnings are estimated in the band of $9.27-$9.47, reflecting growth of 31-33% year over year. Revenues are expected in the band of $99,000-$102,000 million. Adjusted EBITDA is expected between $7,600 million and $7,800 million.Coming to guidance for Express Scripts’ core business, total adjusted claims are expected in the range of 280-290 million for the first quarter of 2018.Client-Retention Rate Positive: Express Scripts entered 2018 with strong market momentum and continued to witness success in retaining key clients. By the end of the previous quarter, the company created trusted client relationships by delivering exceptional care to patients while controlling costs. Its favorable drug-trend results are clearly indicative of the above fact. Buoyed by strong prospects, Express Scripts expects to provide retention rate guidance for 2019 of 96-98%.Express Scripts Getting Acquired: After declaring that Express Scripts is losing its biggest customer — the leading health insurer Anthem Inc., the company recently announced that it is getting acquired by Cigna, a global health insurance company.The acquisition is expected to be completed by Dec 31, 2018. Per the definitive agreement, Cigna will take over Express Scripts in a cash and stock transaction worth $67 billion. Notably, this includes Cigna's assumption of approximately $15 billion debt of Express Scripts.In fact, Moody's Investors Service, the rating services arm of Moody’s Corporation, is worried about Express Scripts’ high customer concentration and pricing pressure. Per Moody’s, Express Scripts is likely to experience declining script volume and higher-than-typical customer losses in the days to come. Other challenges include fewer generic drug introductions, softening mail order growth trends, client focus on cost savings and transparency.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not show an earnings beat for Express Scripts in the quarter.

760,COO,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for The Cooper Companies, Inc. (COO  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 10.1% in that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is COO due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Recent EarningsCooper Companies reported adjusted earnings of $2.79 in first-quarter fiscal 2018, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 10.7% and increasing 44.6% year over year. We believe the upside was driven by robust revenue growth. The stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Revenues increased 4% at constant currency exchange rate (CER) on a year-over-year basis to $590 million. The figure also outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $582.1 million. The stellar top-line performance was driven by silicone hydrogel lenses, led by the Clariti and MyDay in the dailies space and Biofinity in the monthly space.Segmental AnalysisThe company has two business segments — CooperVision (CVI) and CooperSurgical (CSI).CVIRevenues at CooperVision Segment increased 8% at constant currency (cc) to $444.8 million on a year-over-year basis. The segment continues to gain from the company’s silicone hydrogel lenses led by solid prospects in the MyDay, Clariti and Biofinity platforms. Coming to the major catalysts within the CVI segment, robust performance by Toric (31% of CVI revenues), Multifocal (11%), single-use sphere lenses (26%) and non single-use sphere lenses (32%) propelled solid growth.Multifocal revenues rose 5% year over year at cc to $46.9 million, while Toric revenues increased 9% to $137.8 million. Single-use sphere lenses sales climbed 11% at cc to $116.3 million, while sales of non single-use sphere lenses rose 4% to $143.8 million.Geographically, CVI revenues inched up 3% in the Americas and a respective 15% and 9% in the Asia Pacific and EMEA, at cc.CSIRevenues at CooperSurgical Segment declined 6% at cc to $145.2 million on a year-over-year basis. However, the company witnessed 32% increase in this segment on a reported basis on the back of the PARAGARD acquisition. The fertility category (39% of CSI revenues) saw a 5% drop in sales at cc to $57 million. Also, the office and surgical products category declined 6% at cc to $88.2 million.Margin DetailsAs a percentage of revenues, adjusted gross margin at the CSI segment was 69% in the reported quarter, up 700 basis points (bps) year over year. The margin was negatively impacted by the inventory step-up associated with the PARAGARD buyout.As a percentage of revenues, adjusted gross margin at the CVI segment was 67% in the reported quarter, higher than 63% of revenues in the year-ago quarter. This reflects an increase of 400 bps on f avorable currency and product mix.Hence, adjusted gross margin as a whole for Cooper Companies was 68% of revenues, up 500 bps year over year.Adjusted operating margin, as a percentage of revenues, was 28% of net revenues in the fiscal first quarter, up 500 bps on a year-over-year basis.GuidanceFor fiscal 2018, total revenues are now expected in the band of $2,510-$2,560 million compared with the previous $2,480-$2,530 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 revenues is pegged at $2.52 billion, within the guided range.Revenues at the CVI segment are now estimated in the band of $1,865-$1,900 million, higher than $1,830-$1,865 million. Meanwhile, CSI revenue range has been slashed to $645-$660 million from the prior $650-$665 million.Adjusted earnings per share are now anticipated in the band of $11.70-$11.90 versus $11.35-$11.65 earlier. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings stands at $11.57, below the guided range.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. There have been two revisions higher for the current quarter compared to eight lower.The Cooper Companies, Inc. Price and Consensus  The Cooper Companies, Inc.

762,COO,"CVS Health Corporation (CVS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 8, before the opening bell. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 1.5%. Its trailing four-quarter average positive earnings surprise is 3.7%.Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Key CatalystsCVS Health is optimistic about sustaining a solid year-over-year earnings trend in 2017 on the back of gains to be realized from the Pharmacy Services segment. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter Pharmacy Services segment revenues of $33.1 billion reflects an increase of 8.9% from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.However, there are several timing factors that have already affected the cadence of profit delivery last quarter. One such aspect was the timing of profitability in Medicare Part D business. Per the company, the same is expected to continue through the rest of 2017.CVS Health Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  CVS Health Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | CVS Health Corporation QuotePer CVS Health, the timing of Medicare Part D profits in the third quarter remains difficult to forecast, since this is the period when the risk-sharing corridor is usually least effective at providing risk-sharing protection. Hence, any change in any current estimates like utilization, significantly impacts the timing of profits between the third and fourth quarters.The timing of Medicare Part D profitability factor apart, the company expects benefits from enterprise streamlining initiatives to be much more in the back half of the year than the year to date figure. Keeping that in mind, at the last earnings call, the company had projected third-quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.47-$1.50, reflecting a decline of 2.5% to an increase of 1% year over year.Here are some other factors that might also influence CVS Health’s third-quarter results:The company is worried about its Retail/Long Term Care business, wherein revenues are expected to be down 3.25-5% in the third quarter from the year-ago period due to the restricted network changes. Notably, the decision to restrict CVS Health from participating in the TRICARE network and many fully insured prime networks have continued to negatively impact Pharmacy sales and script comps. Additionally, the company’s adjusted script comps are expected to be in the range of down 0.75% to up 0.25% and the total same-store sales to be down in the 4-5.75% band in the yet-to-be-reported quarter.However, it expects PBM revenues to grow 8.5%-9.75%, driven by continued strong growth in volumes and specialty pharmacy. Overall, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter Retail Pharmacy segment net revenues of $19.3 billion reflects a decline of 3.9% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Consolidated net revenues have projected a 2.75-4.25% rise during the third quarter. Overall, the company estimates to deliver healthy PBM growth on a successful PBM selling season. Specialty business is expected to record strong growth and SilverScript’s business also hopes to retain its good performance.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Our proven model does not conclusively show that CVS Health is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a solid Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

763,COO,"Myriad Genetics, Inc. (MYGN  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Nov 7, after the closing bell.Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 15.4%. Moreover, Myriad Genetics beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, the average being 6.2%.Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Key CatalystsSimilar to last quarter, Myriad Genetics is expected to gain from strong Molecular Diagnostics performance led by solid contributions from the GeneSight and EndoPredict tests. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Molecular Diagnostics revenues of $170 million reflects an increase of 3% from the year-ago quarter.We are also upbeat about management’s expectations of double-digit volume growth in fiscal 2018 for GeneSight, Vectra DA, Prolaris and EndoPredict revenues, all of which make up most of the Molecular Diagnostics portfolio. Myriad Genetics, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise   Myriad Genetics, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Myriad Genetics, Inc. QuotePer the company, the GeneSight test represents significant opportunities. As GeneSight is in the initial stages of adoption and is placed in a highly under-penetrated preventive care market, the product has huge growth potential. Management expects consistent growth in GeneSight test revenues in the quarters ahead. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for GeneSight test of $26.1 million reflects an increase of 263.9% from the year-ago quarter and 2.4% sequentially.In March, the company  launched  the EndoPredict test in the United States for patients with early-stage breast cancer and since then has received encouraging response for it. In August, Myriad Genetics received positive coverage decision for the test from Palmetto GBA, a Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC) and Anthem, Inc., one of the largest private insurers in the United States. Notably, full implementation of this decision will lend Myriad Genetics coverage for approximately 90% of breast cancer patients.The company recently announced positive results from a clinical study evaluating EndoPredict which highlights its superiority over the first-generation Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score in predicting breast cancer recurrence in women determined to be at intermediate clinical risk by the Nottingham Prognostic Index. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for GeneSight test of $2.3 million reflects an increase of 35.3% from the year-ago quarter.Here are the other factors that might influence Myriad Genetics’ first-quarter results:Management seemed upbeat about the prospects of the Prolaris test. In May, the company announced the receipt of a positive final Local Coverage Determination (LCD) to expand Medicare coverage of the Prolaris test by Palmetto GBA, a MAC.Again, in May, the company announced plans of showcasing data demonstrating the utility of the Prolaristest in efficiently predicting the 10-year risk of metastases in men treated for prostate cancer at the American Urological Association (AUA) 2017 Annual Meeting. These positive flow of news are expected to to boost the top line in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Prolaris test revenues of $3.3 million reflects an increase of 13.8% from the year-ago quarter.Management estimates adjusted earnings per share of 19-21 cents on total revenue of $181-$183 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 . The Zacks Consensus Estimate for adjusted earnings of 21 cents and revenues of $182 million is within the company’s guided range.On the flip side, unfavorable foreign currency translation continues to pose a threat. With a considerable portion of its revenues coming from outside the United States, the company faces the risk of exchange rate fluctuations. Additionally, macroeconomic uncertainty and higher expenses owing to extensive pipeline of some testsmay impact the company’s margins.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Our proven model shows that Myriad Genetics is likely to beat earnings because it has the perfect combination of two key ingredients.Zacks ESP:  Myriad Genetics has an Earnings ESP of +1.04%. A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Myriad Genetics currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 or 3 (Hold) have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.The combination of Myriad Genetics’ Zacks Rank #2 and +1.04% ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Other Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few other medical stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.The Cooper Companies, Inc.

764,COO,"Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. (ZBH  -  Free Report) is expected to beat earnings when it reports third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 1, before the opening bell.Last quarter, the company’s earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.95%. However, it reported an average beat of 0.36% for two of the trailing four quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Key CatalystsSimilar to the prior quarter, the company is expected to gain from strength in the S.E.T. (Surgical, Sports Medicine, Foot and Ankle, Extremities and Trauma) arm. Revenues at S.E.T. were driven by surgical business and sports medicine offerings such as Gel-One, Subchondroplasty and Quattro Link in the last reported quarter. Moreover, solid uptake of the A.L.P.S. Plating System within the foot and ankle portfolio boosted the segment’s performance.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for S.E.T. revenues of $411 million reflects an increase of 2.2% from the year-ago quarter. Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise   Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. Quote We are also upbeat about the Spine, Craniomaxillofacial and Thoracic (Spine & CMF) segment, which is expected to deliver another quarter of promising performance. Under the spine category, Zimmer Biomet should continue to gain from strong uptake of Mobi-C Cervical Disc. Moreover, though at the initial phase of integration, the LDR Holdings acquisition is expected to contribute approximately 30 basis points to the company’s top line in the to-be-reported quarter. Also, management is hopeful of gaining from significant cross-selling opportunities that the LDR acquisition provides on the back of integrated spine sales force in the United States.Also, continued solid uptake of SternaLock Blu and SternaLock 360 primary closure systems as well as the RibFix Blu Thoracic Fixation System within craniomaxillofacial and thoracic arm buoys optimism.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Spine & CMF revenues of $188 million indicates a rise of 2.2% from the year-ago quarter.Here are the other factors that might influence Zimmer Biomet’s third-quarter results:Looking at the focused execution of Zimmer Biomet’s sales teams, we expect the global adoption rate of the company’s flagship personalized knee system — Persona — to be impressive. In this regard, in September, the company announced the launch of the Persona Partial Knee System. This is the latest addition to its portfolio of personalized and anatomically designed knee implant systems. Also, in June, Zimmer Biomet announced the release of its X-ray-based Patient Specific Instrument, X-PSI Knee System. This is the world's first CE-Marked surgical planning system that allows for patient-specific implant positioning, solely utilizing X-ray technology. These developments are expected to boost the top line in the third quarter.Emerging markets have always been a significant revenue generating source for Zimmer Biomet. Despite the recent economic downturn which affected Zimmer Biomet’s business in Latin America, the company managed to drive growth through its operations in other parts of the emerging market, especially the Asia-Pacific and EMEA (Europe, the Middle East and Africa). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues from EMEA of $379 million indicates an improvement of 2.7% from the year-ago quarter.Overall, Zimmer Biomet expects third-quarter revenues in the range of $1.815-$1.845 billion, reflecting a negative impact from foreign exchange of 0.5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter total revenues is pegged at $1.83 billion.However, factors like macroeconomic uncertainties and unfavorable currency fluctuations have been adversely denting Zimmer Biomet’s sales over the past few quarters. Moreover, the company has also been dealing with pricing pressure issue. In this regard, Zimmer Biomet faced a negative pricing pressure of approximately 2.6% in the second-quarter. Thus, in absence of any favorable changes in this line, the company may continue to face these headwinds in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Meanwhile, for the second half of 2017, management continues to expect the adverse impact from reduced sales expectations, continued spending in critical programs and rising manufacturing costs from Warsaw North Campus facility to persist.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Zimmer Biomet does not have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — needed for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Zimmer Biomet is -0.38%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Zimmer Biomet carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of a positive earnings surprise.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $1.75 reflects a 2.2% decline on a year-over-year basis.Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few medical stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.The Cooper Companies, Inc.

765,COO,"Henry Schein, Inc. (HSIC  -  Free Report) is expected to report third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 1.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 1.2%. Encouragingly, Henry Schein’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the past four quarters, at an average of 2.8%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Henry Schein is likely to beat earnings because it has the perfect combination of two key ingredients.Zacks ESP:  Henry Schein has an Earnings ESP of +1.23% as the Most Accurate estimate is 91 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is lower at 90 cents. A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Henry Schein currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.The combination of Henry Schein’s Zacks Rank #3 and +1.23% ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Henry Schein, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Henry Schein, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Henry Schein, Inc. QuoteFactors at PlayHenry Schein’s second-quarter 2017 results were quite impressive, recording growth across all four segments – Dental, Animal Health, Medical and Technology and Value-Added Services. Geographically, the company gained traction in both North America and overseas. We expect a similar trend in the third quarter as well.The company’s strategy to expand digital dentistry globally is also encouraging. We are also upbeat about management’s expectations to witness at least low single-digit growth in North America’s dental consumable merchandise market in the second half of 2017. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter total revenues of $3.049 billion reflects an increase of 6.4% from the year-ago quarter.The company is currently banking on digital dentistry, which is part of its strategic plan. Henry Schein is busy promoting digital workflows for general dentistry as well as dental specialties. Beginning Sep 1, 2017, the company started selling the full range of Dentsply Sirona dental equipment across North America, including the leading CEREC CAD/CAM restoration system. This is expected to boost the top line to some extent.Notably, during the second quarter, Henry Schein Animal Health opened a new National Distribution Service Center (NDSC) in Columbus’s Brookhollow neighborhood. This has helped the company operate as a complete solution provider for veterinary practices across the country. We expect this to boost the top line in the yet-to-be-reported quarter.On the flip side, Henry Schein’s disappointing gross and operating margins over the past few quarters due to higher cost of sales and expenses is a matter of concern.This apart, currency fluctuations and a tough competitive landscape add to the woes. Also, the entry of group purchasing organizations (GPOs) in the United States has intensified competition.Overall, Henry Schein expects 2017 EPS in the range of $7.17-$7.30, reflecting 8-10% growth from the 2016 EPS figure of $6.61.Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few medical stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.The Cooper Companies, Inc.

766,COO,"Penumbra, Inc. (PEN  -  Free Report) is expected to report third-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Nov 11. The company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 7.6% for three of the trailing four quarters. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.CatalystsOver the past few quarters, Penumbra showcased strong top-line performance on consistent growth in its neuro and peripheral vascular arms. The company is presently focusing on driving innovation, product development and geographic expansion. This is expected to help Penumbra maintain the bullish growth trend in the to-be-reported quarter.It is to be noted that neuro growth was mainly driven by sales of the Penumbra system for ischemic stroke. The company witnessed increased sequential growth on higher procedural volumes. However, the company expects to see seasonality in the neuro business in the third quarter.Also, peripheral vascular growth was driven by the Indigo family and peripheral thrombectomy along with the Coil portfolio in peripheral embolization.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for neuro revenues of $54 million reflects an increase of 13.6% from the year-ago-quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for peripheral vascular revenues of $24.6 million shows a rise of 25.2% from the year-earlier quarter.Penumbra, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Penumbra, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Penumbra, Inc. Quote Overall, fiscal third-quarter total revenues are projected at $79 million, up 17.9% from the prior-year quarter.Here are the other factors that might influence Penumbra’s third-quarter results:Penumbra has been delivering strong performance in both domestic and international markets on the back of solid contributions from its neuro business. We expect the trend to continue in the yet-to-be-reported quarter.In second-quarter 2017, gross margin deteriorated and operating expenses increased. According to the company, increased compensation expenses related to growth in headcount and higher clinical trial expenses resulted in operating loss in the quarter. We expect escalating costs and expenses to continue to keep margins under pressure in the third quarter.Meanwhile, research and development expenses increased 29.2% in the second quarter. With the company remaining focused on product launches, we expect expenses to remain high in the third quarter.Further, foreign exchange fluctuations and stiff competition from major commercial laboratories and hospitals continue to raise caution.Overall, the company expects revenues to decline sequentially in the third quarter owing to seasonality in summer. The company expects to report revenues in the band of $312-$317 million.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Penumbra has the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP  and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.

767,COO,"We expect IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. (IDXX  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 31, before the opening bell. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 11.8%. It is worth noting that IDEXX has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the preceding four quarters, at an average of 9.3%. Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Key CatalystSimilar to the prior quarter, IDEXX is expected to gain from strong global growth in Companion Animal Group (CAG) Diagnostics recurring revenues. The growth in CAG Diagnostics was led by double-digit organic revenue gains across consumable, reference lab and rapid assay revenues, as well as continued expansion of IDEXX's premium instrument installed base.We are upbeat about the 300% year-over-year rise in the uptake of SNAP Pro units in North America last quarter. Management expects the solid performance to continue in the to-be-reported quarter as well.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CAG Diagnostics revenues of $426 million reflects an increase of 10.6% from the year-ago quarter.Here are the other factors that might influence IDEXX’s third-quarter results:IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise   IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. QuoteIDEXX expects its Livestock, Poultry and Dairy (LPD) business to witness flat-to-modest growth in the second half of 2017. The segment has been seeing continued strength in China. Also, expansion of the recurring pregnancy testing franchise buoys optimism. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the LPD business of $30.3 million for the third quarter reflects an increase of 1.7% from the year-ago quarter.The company continues to expand globally. It has been significantly benefitting from the bountiful opportunities in the companion animal market of emerging nations. Further, management’s consistent share buybacks reflect its strong free cash flow reserve. We believe the outcome of these endeavors will be reflected in the company’s third-quarter performance.Encouraged by these factors, IDEXX expects 2017 revenue in the range of $1,945-$1,965 million, reflecting organic revenue growth expectations between 10% and 11%. The Zacks Consensus Estimates for third-quarter total revenues are projected at $494 million, up 10.3% from the prior-year quarterManagement also estimates its 2017 EPS guidance to the band of $3.12-$3.22 per share, supported by continued operating margin expansion aligned with its long-term goals. The outlook represents EPS growth of 28-32% on a reported basis. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $3.17 reflects an increase of 29.9% from the year-ago quarter.Moreover, management is upbeat about the 12% rise in the sales force in the U.S. market and some other areas in the third quarter.On the flip side, foreign currency fluctuation is a major headwind. Another concern for the company is its high reliance on third-party distributors. The purchasing dynamics of distributors have a significant impact on the company’s sales of instrument consumables and rapid assay products. Also, the company is exposed to higher operating expenses pertaining to increased head count along with higher investments targeted toward portfolio development and geographic expansion in the United States and internationally.Also, the competitive landscape in the domestic and overseas markets weighs on IDEXX’s performance. The struggle to gain market traction might prove to be a drag on third-quarter 2017 results.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:IDEXX does not have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — needed for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for IDEXX is 0.00%.

768,COO,"Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (LH  -  Free Report), also known as LabCorp, is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results, before market opens on Oct 25. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3.8%. It has an average earnings beat of 1.1% for three of the trailing four quarters. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayLabCorp’s top-line performance continues to be affected by softness in its Covance Drug Development business, as was the case in the last reported quarter as well. The weak performance was led by sluggish early development and central lab businesses, which were affected by a slower revenue conversion from backlog and cancellation by sponsors of two large clinical studies in 2016. Also, adverse foreign exchange rates affected the numbers to the tune of 140 basis points (bps) at this segment.Meanwhile, we are upbeat about the company’s expectations of an improvement in the Covance Drug Development arm starting the second half of 2017. This should get reflected in the third-quarter performance.Over the last two years, LabCorp has faced several reimbursement issues that have dented its revenues. The company is concerned about the CMS (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services) proposal related to Protecting Access to Medicare Act (PAMA). We believe reimbursement pressure will affect the company’s performance in the soon-to-be-reported quarter as well.Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings Price and EPS Surprise   Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings Price and EPS Surprise | Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings QuoteNotably, the company are not positive about the latest Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) publication of proposed 2018 Medicare reimbursement rates for clinical laboratory tests under the Clinical Lab Fee Schedule (CLFS). However, this will most likely have no impact on its third-quarter results.Unfavorable foreign exchange continues to be a pressing concern for the company. Previously, LabCorp had anticipated an approximate 40-bps negative currency impact on 2017 revenues. The company currently expects a 20-bps impact from adverse foreign exchange on net revenue at Covance Drug Development in 2017.LabCorp has been continuously grappling with the issue of rising operating expenses which has affected its margins in the last reported quarter. Also, the chances of a turnaround in the scenario any time soon are slim.Meanwhile, on a positive note, LabCorp is focusing on research and development in collaboration with academic institutions in order to gain traction in the growing lab testing market. In July 2017, LabCorp launched ADAMTS13 test to distinguish diseases characterized by life-threatening, acute thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). Also, in May, company expanded its VistaSeq Hereditary Cancer portfolio through the addition of 10 new test panels with focus on the risk of specific hereditary cancer syndromes.LabCorp recently teamed up with Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report) to set up specimen collection service stations at various Walgreens stores across the United States. The company also expanded its reach by closing the acquisition of Mount Sinai Health System Clinical Outreach Laboratories in May 2017. LabCorp’s highly differentiated portfolio will be used by the existing customers of Mount Sinai. These developments are expected to boost the top line in the third quarter.LabCorp’s companion diagnostics portfolio, which grew a robust 35% in the last couple of years, should maintain its momentum in 2017.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that LabCorp is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP:  LabCorp has an Earnings ESP of -1.84%.

Price and EPS Surprise   Align Technology, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Align Technology, Inc. QuoteWhat’s Driving the Better-Than-Expected Earnings?We are upbeat about Align Technology’s strategic initiatives like international expansion, ensuring Invisalign treatment for a growing base of patients. Also, we are upbeat about the international teen case growing 40.5% year over year in the last reported quarter, reflecting growing demand. In the quarter, the company reached a new benchmark of 1 million teen patients who had adopted the Invisalign treatment.Management anticipates consistent growth in the Asia-Pacific region. In a bid to grow in this region, the company opened new Invisalign Treatment Planning Facility in China.We are upbeat about management’s expectations of continued strong performance in international markets in the to-be-reported quarter. Invisalign volumes are likely to grow sequentially, reflecting continued strong growth in APAC. However, summer holidays in EMEA may partially mar the performance.Notably, to expand its Invisalign brand, Align Technology introduced a patient-friendly solution – Invisalign Teen with mandibular advancement – for teens in certain markets of Canada, EMEA and APAC in March. According to the company, this advancement will help it offer more options for teen treatment which might boost its top line in the yet-to-be reported quarter. In May, the company announced the receipt of two U.S. patents for Align Technology’s SmartTrack aligner material that is exclusively used for Invisalign aligner treatment.Recently, the company expanded work flow options of its leading iTero scanners.  In this context, Align Technology recently signed a distribution agreement with Patterson Dental, a business unit of Patterson Companies, Inc. (PDCO  -  Free Report). Per the non-exclusive agreement, effective September 2017, Align Technology’s iTero Element intraoral scanning system will be available as part of Patterson Dental’s CAD/CAM portfolio in the United States and Canada. This latest development should boost the iTero scanner customer base starting from the third quarter itself.Moreover, the company saw increased adoption of iTero scanners for Invisalign case submissions instead of PVS impressions especially in North America, thereby driving Invisalign utilization. Management expects this bullish trend to continue in the yet-to-be reported quarter.Notably, for the third quarter of 2017, the company projects EPS of 78-81 cents on revenues of $355-$360 million. The company also expects Invisalign case shipments in the band of 231,000 to 234,000, up 27-29% over the same period a year ago.On the flip side, unfavorable foreign currency might affect the company’s revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. Also, the company is exposed to seasonal demand fluctuations, higher operating expenses pertaining to increased head count along with higher investments targeted toward growth acceleration through geographical expansion and portfolio expansion.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few other medical stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.The Cooper Companies, Inc.

However, GNC Holdings’ trailing four-quarter earnings average miss stands at 19.9%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayGNC Holdings' last reported second-quarter 2017 revenues dropped 4.8% year over year. Apart from lower sales at the U.S. & Canada international and manufacturing/wholesale segments, the decline in revenues can be attributed to an overall drop in sales of protein, vitamins, weight management and food and drink categories. In absence of any catalyst to drive growth, we expect a similar trend in the third quarter of 2017 as well.Moreover, GNC Holdings has a number of competitors in the market that include large international pharmacy chains, supermarket firms and big U.S.-based companies with global operations. Thus, we expect the company to slash product prices in the face of stiff competition, which in turn, might hurt margins. GNC Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  GNC Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | GNC Holdings, Inc.

Also, in the last reported quarter, PRO Access members doubled their visits, purchased double the products and spent significantly more in the second quarter.

771,COO,"Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (WBA  -  Free Report) is slated to release fourth-quarter and full-year fiscal 2017 results before the market opens on Oct 25.Last quarter, the company had posted a positive earnings surprise of 1.53%. It is worth noting that Walgreens has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the preceding four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 2.63%. Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayWalgreens Boots' Retail Pharmacy USA division continued to witness comparable prescription growth as well as strength in retail prescription market in the last reported quarter. Notably, in the fiscal second quarter, the Retail Pharmacy USA division saw the highest comparable prescription growth in more than seven years.Several planned developments, early benefits of new pharmacy contracts and volume increase from previously announced strategic pharmacy partnerships have been driving growth in this space over the past few quarters. We expect this growth momentum to continue in the fiscal fourth quarter as well.Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. QuoteBased on a promising performance in the preceding quarter, Walgreens Boots raised the low end of its guidance for fiscal 2017 by 8 cents and currently expects full-year adjusted earnings in the range of $4.98 to $5.08. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal fourth-quarter earnings of $1.22 reflects a 14% improvement on a year-over-year basis. Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal fourth-quarter revenues of $30.09 billion reflects a 5.1% improvement on a year-over-year basis.However, the sales performance of the Retail Pharmacy international division continued to disappoint. The reduction in government pharmacy funding in the U.K. has been affecting performance. In absence of any near-term catalyst, we expect the scenario to persist in the upcoming quarter as well.We also note that slowdown in generic introduction has been affecting Walgreens Boots' margins. Of late, increased reimbursement pressures as well as generic drug cost inflation have been denting margins. In the third quarter of 2017, Walgreens Boots' gross margin contracted on account of reimbursement pressure and price inflation of branded drugs.Management continues to witness lower profitability in Boots UK comparable pharmacy's gross profit due to lower margin products. Although the company is working to boost efficiency and provide high-quality, cost-effective pharmacy services, the near-term outlook remains bleak.Meanwhile, market growth is expected to be strong in certain emerging markets backed by the timing of price increase. Also, in order to expand its footprint in Asia, the company launched its first Boots franchise store in South Korea in April 2017. This development is expected to boost the top line in the fiscal fourth quarter.In September 2017, Walgreens Boots announced the receipt of U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) approval for the purchase of 1,932 stores, three distribution centers and related inventory from Rite Aid for a total value of $4.375 billion.

772,COO,"Quest Diagnostics Inc. (DGX  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 earnings results before the opening bell on Oct 19.Last quarter, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 14 cents delivering a positive earnings surprise of 9.9%. Also, Quest Diagnostics outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all trailing four quarters with an average beat of 7.1%.Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayAfter several quarters of sustained drag in the company’s revenue per requisition performance,last quarter saw a slight rebound. However, it still remains to be seen if this improvement is here to stay or not. The company’s two Professional Lab Services (PLS) engagements — WJ Barnabas Health and HealthONE System of HCA Holdings, Inc. (HCA) — carry lower revenue per requisition due to the nature of work.Overall, we believe that a low level of employment and slow growth of commercially-insured lives will continuously impact the company’s volume (measured by the number of requisitions) environment till the economy turns around for better.Quest Diagnostics Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise Quest Diagnostics Incorporated price-eps-surprise | Quest Diagnostics Incorporated QuoteThis apart, unit price headwinds were less than 100 bps in the previously reported second quarter. While unit price headwinds hovered in moderate ranges (at approximately 1%) over the last few years, the company continues to expect the same for the rest of 2017 too.Also, over the last two years, Quest Diagnostics has faced several reimbursement issues that affected its revenues. The company is concerned about the CMS (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services) proposal related to Protecting Access to Medicare Act (PAMA). We believe, reimbursement pressure will be reflected as an overhang in the company’s performance this soon-to-be-reported quarter too.Notably, the company has not positively taken the latest Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) publication of proposed 2018 Medicare reimbursement rates for clinical laboratory tests under the Clinical Lab Fee Schedule (CLFS). However, this leaves no impact on its yet-to-be-reported quarter’s revenue numbers.On a positive note, Quest Diagnostics seems to be determined to repeat its well-meaning efforts from second-quarter 2017 by stimulating the company’s performance via a two-point growth strategy to accelerate growth and drive operational excellence.We are also optimistic about the company’s successful execution of its strategy to grow esoteric testing business and drive profitable growth.Additionally, Quest Diagnostics has recently witnessed significant growth through infectious disease testing, prescription drug monitoring and industry-leading wellness business. We expect these growth drivers to remain active through the third quarter as well, driving the same metrics as in the preceding quarter.We strongly believe all these recent developments to significantly contribute to the company’s top line in the third quarter.The company currently expects full-year 2017 revenues in the range of $7.69-$7.74 billion (annualized growth of 2.6-3.4%). The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $7.7 billion, just above the lower-end of the guided range.In addition, the company’s 2017 adjusted EPS range remains at $5.62-$5.72. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.65 is within this range.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Quest Diagnostics is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Quest Diagnostics has an Earnings ESP of -2.52%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of $1.33 is pegged lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.37. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Quest Diagnostics has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which decreases the predictive power of ESP. Combined with a negative ESP, Quest Diagnostics’ chances of an earnings beat can not be conclusively predicted.We caution against the stocks with Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few stocks worth considering from the same space as our proven model shows them to comprise the right combination of elements to beat estimates this quarter:  The Cooper Companies, Inc. (COO  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.62% and a Zacks Rank #2.

773,COO,"More than a month has gone by since the last earnings report for The Cooper Companies, Inc. (COO  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 7.7% in that time frame, underperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Cooper Companies Beats Earnings Estimates in Q3Cooper Companies reported adjusted earnings of $2.64 in third-quarter fiscal 2017, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6 cents and improving from $2.30 in the year-ago quarter. We believe that the upside was driven by robust revenue growth.Revenues increased to $556 million from $515 million recorded in the prior-year quarter. The figure also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $552 million. Solid top-line performance was driven by innovative products like Biofinity and daily silicone hydrogel lenses.Revenue SegmentsThe Cooper Companies has two business segments – CooperVision (CVI) and CooperSurgical (CSI).CooperVision Segment: CVI revenues increased 8% at constant currency (cc) to $437.3 million on a year-over-year basis. Revenues continue to gain from the company’s silicone hydrogel lenses led by solid prospects in the MyDay, Clariti and Biofinity platforms. Coming to the major catalysts within the CVI segment, robust performance by Toric (31.6% of CVI revenues), Multifocal (10.7% of CVI revenues), Single-use sphere lenses (26.5% of CVI revenues) and Non single-use sphere lenses (31.2%) propelled solid growth.Multifocal revenues rose 7% at cc to $46.8 million, while Toric revenues increased 11% at cc to $138.3 million on a year-over-year basis. Single-use sphere lenses sales climbed 14% at cc to $115.8 million, while sales of non single-use sphere lenses inched up 2% at cc to $136.4 million year over year.Geographically, CVI revenues increased 2% in the Americas, while revenues from the Asia Pacific and EMEA rose 13% year over year at cc.CooperSurgical Segment: CSI revenues jumped 4% at cc to $118.7 million on a year-over-year basis.Coming to the CSI segment, the fertility category witnessed a 6% rise (at cc) in sales in the reported quarter on a year-over-year basis, totaling $65.5 million. However, the office and surgical products category at the CSI segment inched up 1% at cc to $53.2 million.Margin DetailsAdjusted gross margin in the reported quarter was 65% of revenues as compared with 64% registered in the year-ago quarter. The gross margin improvement was fueled by favorable product mix within the CooperVision segment, improved margins at CooperSurgical segment, and favorable foreign exchange.Adjusted operating margin, as a percentage of revenues, was 26% in the fiscal third quarter flat on a year-over-year basis.GuidanceFiscal 2017: For fiscal 2017, total revenue is expected in the band of $2,129–$2,142 million, up from the previously issued range of 2,110–$2,135 million.Revenues at the CVI segment are estimated between $1,670 and $1,680 million, up from the previously guided range of $1,645 million and $1,665 million, while CSI revenues are projected in the range of $459 - $462 million, a little lower from the previously guided range of $465–$470 million.Meanwhile, adjusted earnings are anticipated in the band of $9.66–$9.76, up from the previously provided range of $9.50–$9.65 per share.Fourth Quarter: The Cooper Companies expects revenues in the range of $552 million to $565 million. CVI revenues are expected between $435 million and $445 million, while CSI revenues are anticipated between $117 million and $120 million. The company expects adjusted earnings per share between $2.60 and $2.70.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?Following the release, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates. There have been two revisions higher for the current quarter. While looking back an additional 30 days, we can see even more upward momentum. There have been three upward revisions in the last two months.The Cooper Companies, Inc. Price and Consensus   The Cooper Companies, Inc. Price and Consensus | The Cooper Companies, Inc.

776,COO,"After Hurricane Irma exited following a lesser-than-estimated impact and North Korea stayed away from any further nuclear missile test, the Wall Street got back its shine.Furthermore, Apple’s (AAPL  -  Free Report) annual consumer-products event held on Sep 12 is expected to revive investor appetite in the technology space. In fact, the record-high closings of the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq indices on Sep 11 are indicative of the fact that the U.S. equity markets have been performing really well for quite some time now.Republican Brunt on MedTech SpaceWhile the overall investment world has been gaining prominence, investors in the MedTech industry are unfortunately seeing a reverse trend. This is largely because of the healthcare policy related debacle that had started since the change of President.After a series of regulatory debacles, the Republicans’ agenda to exterminate the Obamacare failed miserably. Stocks tumbled and things got riskier when the “skinny"" repeal bill to partially retract Obamacare fell flat as well.In this regard, let’s not forget the tax-reform pledges that President Trump had taken to abolish the infamous 2.3% medical device sales tax. Although investor confidence trends up with the hope of ‘enactment of new tax reforms’, we believe the market has not got a whiff of it due to the lack of favorable developments in the regulatory front.Dental Grapples With Political IssuesAmid such a political conundrum in the MedTech space, the condition of the U.S. dental industry has been getting worse as well. However, this sector has had a stellar performance on the bourse over the last five years, gaining 94.7%, outperforming the S&P 500’s return of just 73%.Apart from the major political issues that have affected consumer spending in the dental space, there are issues like ease of entrance of dental suppliers, abundance of substitutes, monopoly of suppliers, strict consumer sovereignty and intra-industry rivalry which have been impeding the industry’s growth for quite some time now.Also, aggressive reimbursement policy adopted by the government and insurers has made it difficult for medical companies to market their products due to increased scrutiny. A notable exception to this trend has been stocks concerning dentistry, since consumers pay a higher percentage of costs in this particular industry. Undoubtedly, dental stocks have been facing the regulatory brunt.Accordingly, the scenario of the industry is gradually deteriorating and over the last three years, it has just gained 20.6%, much lower than the S&P 500’s return of almost 25%. Furthermore, a discouraging broader industry rank (among Bottom 31% of more than 250 industries) indicates looming concerns for the dental space. We also note that this industry’s projected earnings per share growth rate is 8.7%, lower than the S&P 500’s 9.8%. 5 Dental Stocks to Bet OnOwing to the adversities, market watchers have adopted a bearish stance toward the dental space. However, these are the only five dental stocks that are expected to beat the ongoing MedTech gloom. Apart from a strong Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), these stocks have a favorable estimate revision trend.VWR Corporation : This Zacks Rank #2 company is an independent worldwide provider of products, services and solutions to laboratory and production facilities. VWR is currently looking forward to long-term synergy benefits from the proposed merger with Avantor. Based on a series of initiatives taken of late, VWR has showed balanced growth in the Americas and EMEA-APAC organically.Avantor's buyout of VWR is expected to create a major consumables-focused solutions and services provider for the high-growth life sciences and advanced technologies industries. The acquisition will build on the company's strengths, including Avantor's cGMP manufacturing processes, significant exposure to emerging markets and VWR's strong position in the Americas and Europe.Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been promising. The current year has seen two estimates go higher in the past 60 days, while one next-year estimate moved up in the same time period. This had a nominal impact on the consensus estimate though as both the current and next year consensus estimates have risen 0.5% in the past two months.VWR Corporation Price and Consensus  VWR Corporation Price and Consensus | VWR Corporation QuoteThe Cooper Companies Inc. (COO  -  Free Report)): This Zacks Rank #2 company is a specialty medical device manufacturer operating on a global basis.

778,COO,"Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corporation (IART  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 27, before the market opens.In the third quarter, Integra LifeSciences derived 41% of its total revenues from the Orthopedics and Tissue Technologies business. Let us take a sneak peek at what the fourth-quarter earnings season is expected to bring forth for this business segment.How Is Orthopedics and Tissue Technologies Placed?Notably, Regenerative Technologies is the largest franchise under Orthopedics and Tissue Technologies. In third-quarter 2017, the company registered mid-single digit growth in this franchise, primarily banking on the addition of Derma Sciences and strong growth in inpatient skin portfolio. Organic sales, excluding effects of storm-related disruption, increased 6%.Management is hopeful about gaining from continued strength in this business in fourth-quarter 2017 as well. Accordingly, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Orthopedics and Tissue Technologies revenues of $123 million reflects an increase of 33.8% from the year-ago quarter.We encouragingly note that, in the fourth-quarter 2017, Integra LifeSciences introduced several products that have broadened its portfolio of solutions in the U.S. hernia repair market and in the European breast reconstruction market. In this regard, the company launched collagen matrices — Revize/Revize-X — for plastic and reconstructive surgery.Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corporation Quote Available in solid and 2:1 meshed configuration, Revize/Revize-X Collagen Matrix are derived from fetal bovine dermis which contains high levels of Type III collagen. Per the company, Revize/Revize-X will aid in implanting and strengthening weak soft tissue along with surgical repairing of damaged or ruptured soft tissue membranes.Solidifying its footprint in plastic and reconstructive surgery, this global medical technology company recently announced the launch of a collagen matrix SurgiMend PRS Meshed — featuring a 2: 1 meshing pattern. In a parallel release, Integra LifeSciences announced the launch of SurgiMend PRS Meshed for pre- and sub-pectoral breast reconstruction in Europe. These developments should boost the company’s revenue in the fourth quarter itself.Integra LifeSciences’ efforts to grow in the plastic and reconstructive surgery market seem to be strategic, per Technavio data published in Business Wire. Per the report, the global plastic surgery products market is expected to reach a value of around $15 billion, at a CAGR of 9% between 2016 and 2020. Thus, the latest launches will help Integra LifeSciences cash in on the opportunities in this niche market and boost the top line in the to-be-reported quarter.We note that the company has been seeing considerable progress in its extremity product line. Last March, Integra LifeSciences announced full commercial expansion of its Cadence Total Ankle System. The company developed the ankle prosthesis in collaboration with renowned foot and ankle surgeons. The Cadence Total Ankle System was made fully available in the United States, Canada and select European countries. In the same month, the company launched Titan Press-Fit Reverse Shoulder for Fracture. The latest introductions are expected to help the company gain traction.Preliminary ResultsNotably, Integra LifeSciences reported preliminary, unaudited revenues of approximately $365 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, up 40% year over year. The preliminary revenue figure is nominally higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $364.9 million.Per management, the stellar quarterly performance was strongly backed by strong organic growth at the Orthopedics and Tissue Technologies business.Integra LifeSciences expects fourth-quarter adjusted earnings per share to cross the high end of the guidance.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Integra LifeSciences has the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP  and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Integra LifeSciences is +2.66%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Integra LifeSciences’ Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP.Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 57 cents reflects a 9.6% rise on a year-over-year basis.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few other medical stocks worth considering as these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Universal Health Services (UHS  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.96% and a Zacks Rank #2.

779,COO,"Patterson Companies, Inc. (PDCO  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Mar 1. The company anticipates a decline in the Dental Supply segment — one of its major revenue components. While this can majorly dampen earnings, an expected improvement in Animal Segment operating income should drive results.Notably, Patterson Companies reported adjusted earnings of 51 cents per share in second-quarter fiscal 2018, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 54 cents. Net sales fell 2.3% from the year-ago quarter to $1.39 billion and lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.42 billion.Let us take a look at how things are shaping up before the release.Dental-Supply Segment to Decline in Q3The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Dental Supply segment is $592 million for third-quarter fiscal 2018. This reflects a decline of almost 5.4% year over year.The loss of exclusive distribution rights with Dentsply Sirona (XRAY  -  Free Report) forced the company to shift to a new enterprise resource planning system to efficiently manage inventory. However, the system is creating short-term challenges. Undoubtedly, the termination of the contract presents new opportunities for Patterson Companies to expand distribution platform to a wider range of product offerings. However, the company continues to witness heavy initial impact from the loss of this deal.Patterson Companies, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Patterson Companies, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Patterson Companies, Inc. Quote The company’s decision to end exclusive distribution will affect results through fiscal 2018. In fact, dental segment sales have been sluggish over the last couple of quarters. Management has provided a dull guidance for the coming quarters as well.In the last quarter, dental sales (40% of total sales) fell 8.4% at constant currency (cc)  year over year to approximately $553.6 million. The downside was caused by lower sales of CEREC and digital technology products. Management expects headwinds in the technology-based equipment business to persist through fiscal 2018, adding to the company’s woes.Other Factors at PlayEstimates & GuidanceFor the third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for adjusted earnings is pegged at 51 cents, reflecting a decline of 12.1% year over year. Management anticipates headwinds in its technology equipment business to persist through fiscal 2018. This is primarily because of Patterson Companies’ initiatives to transit its sales model to an expanded technology product portfolio.Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $1.38 billion, showing a decline of 1.1% year over year.In the last quarter, the company estimated adjusted earnings per share for fiscal 2018 in the range of $2.00-$2.10, way below the previous band of $2.25-$2.40. Patterson Companies expects deal amortization expenses of $25.3 million or 27 cents per share. The company projects integration and business restructuring expenses at $5.3 million or 6 cents per share.Animal Health SegmentAnimal Health is the second important contributor to revenues for Patterson Companies after the dental unit.Steady growth in this unit is expected to be a long-term growth driver. Management expects solid margin improvement in the segment on the back of enhanced partnerships with product manufacturers and strong sales execution. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for operating income from the Animal Health unit is pegged at $30.9 million, reflecting an improvement of 33.1% from the last quarter.However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for net sales is $786 million, reflecting a decline of 4.6% year over year.Our quantitative model does not show an earnings beat for Patterson Companies this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates. This is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Patterson Companies is -0.65%.

780,COO,"Ecolab Inc. (ECL  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 20, before the market opens.Solid performance in the Global Industrial segment is likely to drive the top line in the fourth quarter. Further, an expected improvement in revenues in other segments also is likely to help the company generate solid results.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Global Industrial segment is $1.28 billion. This reflects an increase of 2.6% from the third-quarter figure. Ecolab’s Global Industrial segment primarily provides water treatment and process applications. In third-quarter 2017, revenues in this segment grew 3.8% on a year-over-year basis, to almost $1.25 billion. Recently, Ecolab acquired New York-based Cascade Water Services, which is to be integrated in its Water Business. Ecolab Inc. Price and Consensus  Ecolab Inc. Price and Consensus | Ecolab Inc. Quote In the last quarter, the company registered adjusted earnings of $1.37 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny.

The stock has gained 5.5% versus the industry’s decline of 3.9%.Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to the fourth-quarter earnings announcement.Factors at PlayGlobal Energy to Boost Q4 Top LineThe segment operates under the Nalco Champion name.

781,COO,"Henry Schein, Inc. (HSIC  -  Free Report) is expected to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 20.Last quarter, the company missed earnings estimates by 3.3%. However, Henry Schein’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the past four quarters, at an average of 1.5%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayHenry Schein’s third-quarter 2017 results were quite impressive, recording growth across all four segments — Dental, Animal Health, Medical and Technology and Value-Added Services. Geographically, the company gained traction in North America and overseas. We expect a similar trend in the fourth quarter.Favorable Dental Business Trends: The company’s strategy to expand digital dentistry globally is encouraging. We are also upbeat about management’s expectations of at least low single-digit growth in North America’s dental consumable merchandise market in the second half of 2017. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter total revenues of $3.31 billion reflects an increase of 6.1% from the year-ago quarter.The company banks on digital dentistry, which is part of its strategic plan. Henry Schein is busy promoting digital workflows for general dentistry as well as dental specialties. Starting Sep 1, 2017, the company started selling the full range of Dentsply Sirona dental equipment across North America, including the leading CEREC CAD/CAM restoration system. This is expected to boost the top line to a considerable extent. Henry Schien will also continue to represent products from Planmeca, A-dec, Midmark, 3Shape and 3M as well as the dental equipment and consumer product lines of its longstanding partner Danaher under the KaVo Kerr brands.Henry Schein, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Henry Schein, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Henry Schein, Inc. Quote Solid Animal Health Portfolio: We are optimistic about the well-diversified Animal Health product portfolio featuring software, diagnostic equipment, and surgical instruments. The solid product offerings have been driving growth domestically as well as globally.Notably, during the fourth quarter, Henry Schein acquired Merritt Veterinary Supplies and integrated it into its Animal Health business. Merritt has 4,500 veterinary clinics in Eastern United States, with a strong presence in the Southeastern part of the nation. The company offers a comprehensive line of products, including pharmaceuticals, diagnostics and equipment. However, according to Henry Schein, this acquisition will drive earnings post 2017.Growing Medical Business: Henry Schein is consistently working on boosting its Medical segment. Notably, worldwide Medical revenues rose 8% year over year in the last reported third quarter. In October, the company inked an agreement with Cerebral Assessment Systems to distribute Cognivue. This is the first computerized cognitive assessment screening device cleared by the FDA for the detection of early signs of dementia. We believe this development will bolster growth for the company in the field of mental cognitive diseases.In the same month, the company announced an exclusive distribution agreement with Terason to distribute the latter’s uSmart 3200T NexGen. This development remains part of Henry Schein Medical’s Emergency Medical Services business.Broad Distribution Network: We are also upbeat about the company’s widespread distribution network. Apart from North America and Europe, the company has presence in Australia and New Zealand as well as in emerging nations like China, Brazil, Israel, Czech Republic and Poland.On the flip side, Henry Schein’s disappointing gross and operating margin performance over the past few quarters due to higher cost of sales and expenses is a matter of concern.This apart, currency fluctuations and a tough competitive landscape add to the woes. Also, the entry of group purchasing organizations (GPOs) in the United States has intensified competition.Overall, Henry Schein expects 2017 EPS in the range of $3.59-$3.61, reflecting 8-9% growth from the 2016 adjusted EPS figure of $3.31.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Henry Schein is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Henry Schein has an Earnings ESP of -0.94%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 96 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at 97 cents.Zacks Rank: Henry Schein carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, an ESP of -0.94% makes surprise prediction difficult.Nonetheless, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of 97 cents, reflects a rise of 3.2% year over year.Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few medical stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Amphastar Pharmaceuticals (AMPH  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +264.7% and a Zacks Rank #1.

782,COO,"DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc. (DVA  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 13, after the market closes.In the third quarter, the company reported adjusted earnings of 81 cents per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 94 cents. Earnings deteriorated 14.7% on a year-over-year basis. Further, revenues in the last quarter improved 5.1% year over year to $3.92 billion, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.89 billion. However, the company reported an average negative earnings surprise of 1.9% in the trailing four quarters.Over the last year, shares of DaVita have outperformed the broader industry. The stock has returned 13.3% against the industry’s decline of 5.5%. DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc. Price and Consensus  DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc. Price and Consensus | DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc. Quote Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to the announcement.Factors to ConsiderAcquisition-driven Growth: Acquiring dialysis centers and businesses that own and operate similar centers as well as other ancillary services is DaVita’s preferred business strategy. These strategies have bolstered the company’s top line.In 2017, DaVita announced that HealthCare Partners, a unit within its medical group, has entered into a strategic partnership with Cigna, a global health insurance service company that offers health, dental, supplemental insurance and Medicare plans to individuals, families and businesses.While the acquisitions are expected to widen the company’s client base in the fourth quarter, the merger augmented its primary care and specialty physician services as well as hospital and other healthcare services.Overseas Growth: DaVita is steadily expanding in the international markets. In the past few years, the company has strengthened its position in the emerging and developing markets of Brazil, China, Colombia, Germany, India, Malaysia, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal and Saudi Arabia through strategic alliances as well as acquisitions of dialysis centers. These are expected to help DaVita deliver efficient patient care.View for Q4 and 2017: The company expects adjusted operating income in the Kidney Care segment in the range of $1.57-$1.6 billion compared with the previous range of $1.565-$1.625 billion. The range has been tightened as hurricanes are likely to have negative impact on earnings in the fourth quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter is pinned at $3.9 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of 4.9%. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 91 cents for adjusted earnings per share, shows year-over-year decline of 7.1% in growth.Consequently, management is not upbeat about earnings in the upcoming quarter.Labor Union Woes: In California, labor unions proposed a ballot initiative that is likely to alter DaVita’s footprint in the state. If they proceed with the initiative, the company might have to incur significant onetime costs in 2018 to support their advocacy efforts. This is likely to dampen the company’s top-line growth in the fourth quarter.Debt Dependence: Debt refinancing continues to keep DaVita’s financial leverage at high levels. The company depends upon future borrowings to pay debt and fund other liquidity requirements. Additional debts in connection with the HealthCare Partners’ transaction have elevated the outstanding debt levels and are expected to increase borrowing costs.Plagued by the above headwinds, DaVita is unlikely to deliver an earnings beat in fourth-quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not indicate earnings beat for DaVita HealthCare in this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

783,COO,"DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc. (XRAY  -  Free Report) is expected to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 16, before the market opens.The company is expected to see sluggishness in the Ex Precious Metal Segment — one of the major revenue components. This is expected to dampen fourth-quarter results, which might be compensated by improving revenues in other segments.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for U.S. revenues at the Ex Precious Metal Segment is $348 million, down 3.9% from the last quarter. Not just in the United States, the segment is likely to put up an unimpressive show in Europe and Rest of the World. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from the segment in Europe is pegged at $404 million, showing a 6.3% drop from the figure reported in the previous quarter. Further, the consensus estimate for revenues in the segment from the Rest of the World is pegged at $274 million, showing a 6.2% decline from the reported figure in the last quarter.DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc. Price and Consensus  DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc. Price and Consensus | DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc. Quote Moreover, DENTSPLY has been performing unfavorably compared with the broader industry over the last year. The stock has gained 2.4% compared with the industry’s rally of 21.5%.However, DENTSPLY delivered a positive average earnings surprise of 0.93% in the trailing four quarters. In the previous quarter, the company reported earnings of 70 cents per share, topping the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4 cents. Earnings also rose 6.1% on a year-over-year basis.Why Dull Estimates for Ex Precious Metal Segment?Sales of the company’s precious-metal dental alloy products, which are used by third parties to construct crown and bridge materials, are subject to risks from fluctuations of precious metal prices.In the last quarter, revenues in Europe and Rest of the World at the Ex Precious Metal segment deteriorated on a sequential basis. In Europe, revenues declined 3.8% to $380 billion, while revenues in Rest of the World fell 0.4% to $258 million. The lackluster trend is likely to persist in the to-be-reported quarter as well.To avoid the impact of fluctuating prices, DENTSPLY reports net sales with and without precious metal content to show actual performance, independent of precious metal price volatility.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayConsistent Efforts to Achieve Operational Excellence: DENTSPLY is poised to become one of the best operators in the dental industry in terms of cost, quality and overall efficiency. Management consistently focuses on operational expenses and is contemplating to cut an additional $100 million of costs in 2018 and 2019. Apart from plans of expense control, the company intends to drive revenue synergies well beyond this target. We believe that the company’s cost-control efficiencies will be accretive to fourth-quarter results.View for Q4 and 2017: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pinned at $1.06 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 6.05%.While reporting its third quarter, DENTSPLY narrowed its adjusted earnings per share guidance for 2017 to the range of $2.65 to $2.70 from the earlier $2.65 to $2.75. Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 earnings is pegged at $2.65, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 4.68%. However, for the fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for adjusted earnings per share is 81 cents, showing year-over-year growth of 20.9%.Debt Dependence: DENTSPLY exited the third quarter with long-term debt of $1.6 billion. Large amounts of debt are likely to hamper the company’s prospects, in terms of product innovation.Plagued by the above headwinds, DENTSPLY is unlikely to deliver an earnings beat in fourth-quarter 2017.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively indicate earnings beat for DENTSPLY in this quarter.

In the trailing four quarters, McKesson's earnings beat the same with the average being 4.9%.Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for the third quarter is pegged at $52 billion, which improved 3.7% year over year. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that McKesson is likely to beat estimates because it has the perfect combination of two key ingredients.Zacks ESP: The company has an Earnings ESP of +0.16%.

Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 or 3 (Hold) have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.McKesson Corporation Price and Consensus  McKesson Corporation Price and Consensus | McKesson Corporation Quote What’s Driving the Better-Than-Expected Earnings?McKesson Specialty Health unit is likely to drive the company’s top line in the third quarter. The unit is likely to benefit from the closing of the intraFUSION acquisition and the recent BDI Pharma buyout.The company expects to witness solid performance in its Canadian business in the third quarter. Last quarter, McKesson Canada closed the Uniprix banner acquisition and strengthened independent pharmacies. Per management, Uniprix integration activities are progressing well.Further, McKesson Prescription Technology Solutions business continues to make progress on the CoverMyMeds integration.Coming to the Technology Solutions segment, the company divested its Enterprise Information Solutions or EIS business, recently.

785,COO,"Becton, Dickinson and Company’s (BDX  -  Free Report) first-quarter fiscal 2017 results, scheduled for release on Feb 6, are expected to show sluggishness in BD Medical — one of the major revenue components. While this can majorly dampen earnings in the first quarter, an expected improvement in revenues in other segments will help the company generate solid results.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for BD Medical revenues is pegged at $2.03 billion for the first quarter. This indicates a decline of 3.9% from the year-ago quarter.Notably, Becton, Dickinson, also known as BD, delivered positive earnings surprises in the past four quarters, the average being 3.8%. Like the previous quarter, management expects strong numbers in the Biosciences, Diagnostic Systems and Preanalytical Systems units.Major Factors at PlayDull Prospects in BD Life Sciences: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues in the BD Life Sciences segment is pegged at $1.01 billion, down 3.5% year-over-year. In fact, the Biosciences and Diagnostics segments are expected to decline 8.3% and 1.7% respectively on a year-over-year basis. Lower reimbursements for medical products and services have been imposing a downward pressure on the prices of products. Further, longer sales cycles and slower adoption of new technologies are also expected to affect BD’s top line.Foreign Exchange Woes: BD generates more than half of its revenues from international operations (more than 50% in fiscal 2017), which is affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Notably, domestic manufacturers such as BD are being hurt by strong U.S. dollar, which has benefited from more upbeat economic prospects compared with the rest of the world. Currency volatility will continue to be a headwind in first-quarter of fiscal 2018.Emerging Markets Hold Promise: Emerging markets continue to be a key growth driver for BD. The company’s momentum in China and the emerging markets have been already reflected in the previously-reported quarters. We expect the trend to continue in the to-be-reported quarter. In this regard, BD’s strategic transformation of the U.S. dispensing business model has been successfully implemented. Further, the company’s strategy for end-to-end medication management is gaining prominence.Northward Estimate Revisions: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues in the first quarter is $3.04 billion, which grew 4.2% year over year. Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in the first quarter is pegged at $10.87, which improved 14.7% year over year.Becton, Dickinson and Company Price and Consensus  Becton, Dickinson and Company Price and Consensus | Becton, Dickinson and Company QuoteHowever, BD does not have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat. Here is what our quantitative model predicts.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for BD is -0.50%, as the Most Accurate estimate is $2.37 and the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $2.38. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: BD carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). However, we also need a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat this season.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few medical stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Bio-Rad Laboratories (BIO  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +4.45% and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

789,COO,"Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report) recently announced the initiation of a clinical study — The Bifurcation Cohort — to evaluate the efficiency and safety standards of drug-eluting stents (DES) for treating bifurcation lesions.Study in DetailsThe Bifurcation Cohort, part of the RESOLUTE ONYX Post-Approval Study, will cover 250 patients with bifurcation lesions from 30 sites in the United States and Europe. It will be enrolling patients suffering with coronary artery disease (CAD) and receiving Resolute Onyx DES in diameter sizes varying from 2.0-5.0 mm. Notably, the Resolute Onyx DES is not approved for treating bifurcation lesions in the United States. Further, the primary endpoint for the study will be target vessel failure at 12 months.Per Medtronic, data from the study will be submitted to the FDA for expanded indication approval including bifurcation lesions for the Resolute Onyx DES. Further, the company stated that bifurcation lesions are responsible for 20% of all percutaneous coronary interventions. Thus, we believe the positive data will provide impetus to the company’s efforts to achieve expanded FDA approval for the Resolute Onyx DES and accelerate business growth.CSH PerformanceMedtronic is consistently trying to enhance its Coronary & Structural Heart (CSH) segment, which is part of the Cardiac & Vascular Group (CVG) segment.CSH revenues in third-quarter fiscal 2018 were up 14% at CER (18% as reported) on low-30s constant currency growth in transcatheter aortic valves as a result of strong customer uptake of the CoreValve Evolut PRO platform and expanded FDA approval to include patients at intermediate risk.Moreover, continued uptake of the Resolute Onyx drug-eluting stent in the United States and Japan revived the business.We encouragingly note that Medtronic recently received FDA nod for the U.S. launch of the Resolute Onyx 2.0 mm drug-eluting stent. The stent is the smallest in size in the market presently. The Resolute Onyx DES is available for use in all sizes in the United States, Europe and in countries that recognize the CE Mark.Market PotentialMedtronic’s strategy to gain traction in the CSH segment seems to be aligned with data provided by Transparency Market Research. Per the report, the global coronary stent market is expected to see a CAGR of 6.6% from 2013 to 2019.More specifically, the DES market within the Coronary stents market is expanding fast. It is estimated to witness a CAGR of 9.54% in the 2013-2019 period. The market is likely to expand 9% in the United States, 10% in the Asia Pacific, and 3.1% in Europe as well as the Rest of the World.Stock Performance Over the past three months, Medtronic has outperformed the industry, gaining 2.7% as compared with the industry’s 1.8%.  Zacks Rank & Key PicksMedtronic currently carries a Zacks Rank # 3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Intuitive Surgical (ISRG  -  Free Report), Illumina, Inc (ILMN  -  Free Report) and The Cooper Companies, Inc.

Management believes that long-term growth at CSI will be driven by the fertility segment where the company has gained a strong foothold, courtesy of the Reprogenetics, Genesis and Recombine buyouts. Moreover, these purchases expand the company's international presence by opening up opportunities in the markets of Spain, the U.K., Japan, Peru, South America, the UAE, South Africa, Jordan and Taiwan.In the last reported quarter, CSI revenues jumped 4% at constant currency (cc) to $118.7 million on a year-over-year basis.

791,COO,"On Sep 6, we issued an updated research report on Pleasanton, CA-based The Cooper Companies (COO  -  Free Report).Shares of Cooper have outperformed the industry year to date. The shares of the company have increased 37.9% compared with the industry’s gain of 15.3%.Additionally, the company’s earnings estimates have moved north in the current year, reflecting analyst optimism. Over the past month, current and next quarter earnings estimates have increased 1.1% and 1.8%, respectively. Moreover, Cooper reported earnings which have surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters with an average surprise of 4.8%.The company’s leading position in the market of specialty lenses was also supported by highly exclusive products of Biofinity and Clariti. In fact, its flagship silicone hydrogel lenses are expected to deliver strong sales in the coming quarters. The company has also initiated the process of introducing MyDay lenses in the domestic market. It is already available in Europe and has gained significant traction within a short span of time. Clariti lenses hold significant growth prospects for the company.The outlook for the contact lens industry is favorable. A fall in dropout rate of contact lens users and further market penetration, especially in developing nations, is expected with continuous improvisation in the technology. Growth in international markets is something that contact lens manufacturers are banking on. Furthermore, user preferences are shifting from low-feature commodity lenses to expensive single-use and specialty lenses such as lenses with aspherical optical properties or higher oxygen permeable lenses (silicone hydrogels).We believe that Cooper is well positioned to address this shift in customer preferences based on its expansive product portfolio. The company recently introduced Biofinity Energys’ contact lenses, which is targeted at group of users who frequently complain about the discomfort arising from prolonged usage of smartphones, tablets, laptops, in-car displays and other devices. The company is a leader in the high-margin toric lens market. It offers multiple designs of toric lenses across a wide range of parameters, unlike some of its competitors, who offer the same lenses in limited designs. This is expected to further boost the company’s top-line growth going forward.On the flip side, macroeconomic concerns in several international markets might spell trouble for the company. Additionally, the slowdown in the Chinese economy might continue to dent discretionary spending. Also given its significant international presence, Cooper remains highly vulnerable to fluctuations in exchange rates.Zacks Rank & Key PicksCooper carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked medical stocks are Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report), Lantheus Holdings, Inc. (LNTH  -  Free Report) and IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. (IDXX  -  Free Report).

792,COO,"After Trump’s failed efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare, Trump introduced the “skinny” repeal that calls for doing away with parts of Affordable Care Act (ACA) or Obamacare like “individual mandate,” “employer mandate” and “Cadillac taxes”.Last month, the Republicans lost the debate over skinny repeal. The United States witnessed a political dilemma after three Republicans voted in favor of the existing Healthcare Act. They probably decided to support the existing Healthcare Act based on data provided by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT). As per the report, with the abolition of Obamacare, another 17 million people will be uninsured in 2018, 27 million more in 2020 and the count is expected to increase to 32 million in 2026.The cancellation or withdrawal of the individual and employer mandate might have made health insurance and contracted health insurance coverage expensive. This will significantly dent demand for healthcare services, impacting the medical device industry as a whole.However, the MedTech industry is looking forward to the abolishment of the major healthcare taxes, including Cadillac tax and the 2.3% MedTech tax. Although the Republicans failed to pass the skinny repeal, it has been able to delay the Cadillac tax until 2026.Thanks to the postponement of the Cadillac tax, the medical device industry is hopeful that the 2.3% medical device tax would be eradicated soon.In such a mixed scenario, we feel investors should place their bets on large cap stocks that delivered positive average earnings surprises in the last reported four quarters and are witnessing upward revisions in earnings estimates.Stocks to PickWe have selected four medical device stocks with the help of the Zacks Stock Screener (hyperlink) to shortlist Medical Device stocks which are poised for impressive returns over the next five years.

Coming to the major catalysts within the CVI segment, robust performance by Toric (31.6% of CVI revenues), Multifocal (10.7% of CVI revenues), Single-use sphere lenses (26.5% of CVI revenues) and Non single-use sphere lenses (31.2%) propelled solid growth.Multifocal revenues rose 7% at cc to $46.8 million, while Toric revenues increased 11% at cc to $138.3 million on a year-over-year basis. Single-use sphere lenses sales climbed 14% at cc to $115.8 million, while sales of non single-use sphere lenses inched up 2% at cc to $136.4 million year over year.Geographically, CVI revenues increased 2% in the Americas, while revenues from the Asia Pacific and EMEA rose 13% year over year at cc.CooperSurgical Segment: CSI revenues jumped 4% at cc to $118.7 million on a year-over-year basis.Coming to the CSI segment, the fertility category witnessed a 6% rise (at cc) in sales in the reported quarter on a year-over-year basis, totaling $65.5 million. However, the office and surgical products category at the CSI segment inched up 1% at cc to $53.2 million.Cooper Companies, Inc. (The) Price and Consensus  Cooper Companies, Inc. (The) Price and Consensus | Cooper Companies, Inc. (The) QuoteMargin DetailsAdjusted gross margin in the reported quarter was 65% of revenues as compared with 64% registered in the year-ago quarter. The gross margin improvement was fueled by favorable product mix within the CooperVision segment, improved margins at CooperSurgical segment, and favorable foreign exchange.Adjusted operating margin, as a percentage of revenues, was 26% in the fiscal third quarter flat on a year-over-year basis.GuidanceFiscal 2017: For fiscal 2017, total revenue is expected in the band of $2,129–$2,142 million, up from the previously issued range of 2,110–$2,135 million.Revenues at the CVI segment are estimated between $1,670 and $1,680 million, up from the previously guided range of $1,645 million and $1,665 million, while CSI revenues are projected in the range of $459 - $462 million, a little lower from the previously guided range of $465–$470 million.Meanwhile, adjusted earnings are anticipated in the band of $9.66–$9.76, up from the previously provided range of $9.50–$9.65 per share.Fourth Quarter: The Cooper Companies expects revenues in the range of $552 million to $565 million. CVI revenues are expected between $435 million and $445 million, while CSI revenues are anticipated between $117 million and $120 million. The company expects adjusted earnings per share between $2.60 and $2.70.Our TakeThe Cooper Companies ended third-quarter fiscal 2017 on a solid note, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both lines. The company has always seen impressive results at its CooperVision business segment. The CooperSurgical segment also delivered strong sales in the third quarter, buoyed by robust Toric performance. The company provided strong guidance for fiscal 2017. However, the dampening outlook for the CooperSurgical segment indicates looming concerns. Furthermore, intensifying competition in the contact lens space will continue to increase pricing pressure for the company.We also note that The Cooper Companies has completed the acquisition of a small specialty contact lens company named Procornea earlier this month. This added a leading ortho-k technology to the company’s lens portfolio. The acquisition marked the company’s foray in the emerging myopia controlled markets.Considering the outstanding performance of the stock, we expect The Cooper Companies to scale higher in the coming quarters. In this regard, positive long-term growth of 10.8% holds promise.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Edwards Lifesciences Corp. (EW  -  Free Report), IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. (IDXX  -  Free Report) and Cogentix Medical, Inc. .

794,COO,"On Aug 29, we issued an updated research report on Pleasanton, CA-based The Cooper Companies (COO  -  Free Report). The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Shares of Cooper have outperformed the industry year to date. The shares of the company have increased 40.7%  compared with the industry’s gain of 14.0%.Additionally, the company’s earnings estimates have moved north in the current year, reflecting analyst optimism. Over the past month, current and next earnings estimates have increased 10.2% and 6%, respectively. Moreover, Cooper reported earnings have beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters with an average surprise of 4.4%.The company’s leading position in the markets of specialty lenses was also supported by highly exclusive products of Biofinity and Clariti. In fact, its flagship silicone hydrogel lenses are expected to deliver strong sales in the coming quarters. The company has also initiated the process of introducing MyDay lenses in the domestic market. It is already available in Europe and has gained significant traction within a short span of time. Clariti lenses also hold significant growth prospects for the company.The outlook for the contact lens industry is favorable. A fall in dropout rate of contact lens wearers and further market penetration, especially in developing nations, is expected with continuous improvisation in the technology. Growth in international markets is something that contact lens manufacturers are banking on. Furthermore, user preferences are shifting from low-feature commodity lenses to more expensive single-use and specialty lenses, such as lenses with aspherical optical properties or higher oxygen permeable lenses (silicone hydrogels).We believe that Cooper is well positioned to address this shift in customer preferences based on its expansive product portfolio. The company recently introduced Biofinity Energys’ contact lenses, which is targeted at group of users who frequently complain of discomfort arising from prolonged usage of smartphones, tablets, laptops, in-car displays and other devices. The company is a leader in the high-margin toric lens market. It offers multiple designs of toric lenses across a wide range of parameters, unlike some of its competitors, who offer the same lenses in limited designs. This is expected to further boost its top-line growth going forward.On the flip side, macroeconomic concerns in several international markets might spell trouble for the company. Additionally, the slowdown in the Chinese economy might continue to dent discretionary spending. Also given its significant international presence, Cooper remains highly vulnerable to fluctuations in exchange rates.Other Key PicksOther top-ranked medical stocks include IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. (IDXX  -  Free Report), Lantheus Holdings, Inc. (LNTH  -  Free Report) and Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (EW  -  Free Report).

795,COO,"Penumbra Inc. (PEN  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 8, after market close.The four-quarter average earnings beat is 35.7%. However, the company posted a negative earnings surprise of 66.7% in the last quarter. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayPenumbra’s revenues rose 26.4% on a year-over-year basis in the first quarter on the company’s stellar performance in both neuro and peripheral vascular. With the company remaining focused on product launches and geographic expansion, we expect the strong top-line uptrend to continue in the yet-to-be-reported quarter as well.We are also upbeat about the company’s promising guidance for 2017. Penumbra forecasts full-year total revenue in the range of $312 million to $317 million, which represents growth of almost 20% over full-year 2016.Penumbra, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Penumbra, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Penumbra, Inc. QuoteWe are also encouraged by the company’s focus on product development and innovation which should get reflected in the second quarter itself. Notably, research and development expenses increased 40.1% in the first quarter. In line with this, the company introduced a product under the Indigo family, CAT-D. Also, the company received FDA clearance for 3D revascularization device recently within its neuro franchise segment. Further, the company’s latest addition to its SMART COIL family is a wave extra soft finishing coil. Notably, Penumbra’s SMART COIL system is a platinum embolization device comprising complex Standard and Soft coils that change softness profile within a single coil.Coming to first-quarter 2017 results, Penumbra reported loss per share of 10 cents, comparing unfavorably with earnings of 7 cents in the year-ago quarter. Also, both gross and operating margin deteriorated in the first quarter. We expect escalating costs and expenses to continue to keep margins under pressure in the yet-to-be-reported quarter. Moreover, in the first quarter, SG&A expenses had risen 29.2% year over year on increased headcount and personnel-related expenses. If this continues, the company’s operating income and earnings are likely to get affected in the yet-to-be-reported quarter.Further, foreign exchange fluctuations and stiff competition from major commercial laboratories and hospitals continue to raise caution.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show a beat for Penumbra this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Penumbra has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. That is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at a loss of 5 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Penumbra’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Meanwhile, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies you may consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in the upcoming quarter:The Cooper Companies, Inc. (COO  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.95% and a Zacks Rank #2.INSYS Therapeutics, Inc. (INSY  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +33.3% and a Zacks Rank #1.

796,COO,"Earnings growth enthralls almost everyone, right from the top brass to research analysts. But the question here is why? This is simply because earnings are a measure of the money a company is making. Take a company’s revenues over a given period of time, subtract the cost of production and you will have its earnings!This metric is also considered the most significant variable in influencing the share price. Better-than-expected earnings performances normally lead to a rally in the share price. However, in addition to actual earnings, expectations of earnings play a vital role in determining share price movement.Earnings Estimates Shape Stock PricesWe have often seen a decline in the stock price despite earnings growth and a rally in the price following an earnings decline. This is largely a result of a company’s earnings failing to meet market expectations.So, what does earnings estimates symbolize? Earnings estimates embody analysts’ opinions of factors such as sales growth, product demand, competitive industry environment, profit margins and cost controls. Thus, earnings estimates are a valuable tool for investors. Analysts can also examine the cash flow based on these periodic earnings estimates to determine the fair value of the company.Hence, it is important for investors to buy stocks that have historical earnings growth and are also seeing a rise in quarterly and annual earnings estimates.The Winning StrategyIn order to shortlist stocks that have striking earnings growth and positive estimate revisions, we added the following parameters:Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2 (Only Zacks' 'Buys' and 'Strong Buys' are allowed. With the Zacks Rank proving itself to be one of the best rating systems out there, this is a great way to start things off.)
