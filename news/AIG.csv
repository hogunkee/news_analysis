0,AIG,"Top hedge fund managers have bet against Warren Buffett and taken large positions in UnitedHealth (UNH), Anthem (ANTM) and other health insurers.XMeanwhile Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) has more than doubled its stake in generic drugmaker Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA). It also confirmed it has become the second-largest shareholder in Apple (AAPL).In an SEC filing detailing its U.S.-listed stock holdings as of March 31, the company said it owned about 40.5 million Teva American depositary receipts worth about $693 million. This is up from 18.9 million ADRs worth $358 million the previous quarter.Health insurers shares slumped after Buffett, Amazon (AMZN) chief Jeff Bezos, and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon announced January a joint venture whose aim is to cut U.S. health care costs.""We want our employees to get better medical services at lower cost,"" Buffett said at Berkshire's annual shareholder's meeting earlier this month. ""The resistance will be unbelievable, and if we fail, at least we tried.""However rivals are betting against the plan, with power player Jana Partners revealing Tuesday new positions in Anthem and Cigna (CI), while Omega Advisors and billionaire investor Julian Robertson's Tiger Management have taken new positions in UnitedHealth, according to their regulatory filings.Teva had been under pressure since Mylan's (MYL) generic version of its multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone was approved in October and amid challenges facing the U.S. generic medicines industry.To contend, Teva announced a restructuring plan to trim $3 billion in spending by closing plants and cutting drug programs. In February, Teva said it was well on its way to realizing half those savings by year's end.One Buffett decision that hedge fund managers seem to agree with is his increased Apple holding. Barry Rosenstein's Jana Partners has a new position in the tech giant, though it has sold all its shares in Facebook (FB). Highlighting the rough recent performance of homebuilders, Jana also revealed it had cut its stake in D.R. Horton by 96% to 47,000 shares. Other new positions include Adobe Systems (ADBE), ADT (ADT), Boston Scientific (BSX) and Dr Pepper Snapple (DPS).In contrast, Tiger Management upped its positions in Facebook, while also taking more stock in Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL).David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital added InterActiveCorp (IAC) and exited Chemours (CC)Activist investor Carl Icahn sold off his stake of American International Group (AIG) and increased his position in Herbalife Nutrition (HLF). Hedge fund superstar Bill Ackman famously lost his $1 billion bet against Herbalife back in March, which he took out after claiming the company was a pyramid scheme.Third Point raised its stake in Facebook by 18%, took 1.5 million shares in Wynn Resorts (WYNN) and 550,000 shares in Microsoft (MSFT).YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:CVS: 'We're Going To Deliver' What Amazon, JPMorgan, Berkshire Seek To DoAmazon, Berkshire Hathaway, JPMorgan Chase Team On Health Care; CVS, UnitedHealth DiveCould Facebook, Esports, Media Boom From Legalized Sports Betting?

8,AIG,"Axa Chief Executive Officer Thomas Buberl is betting the worst is over for insurance.X His $15.3 billion purchase of XL Group (XL), the company's biggest ever, will make Axa the top provider of commercial casualty coverage just as premiums rise after last year's hurricanes and California wildfires. The deal will also allow the insurer to focus on parts of the industry that are less sensitive to financial markets, a key target for insurers after investment income was hurt by a decade of low interest rates.Shareholders were less than enthusiastic about the deal. The Paris-based firm fell the most since June 2016 after the announcement, with analyst Daniel Bischof of Baader Helvea saying that the deal has a sound logic, but the price is at the upper end of expectations. Axa is paying 57.60 a share, a premium of about one-third compared with the stock's closing price on Friday. XL's shares had gained 23% this year before Monday's announcement.The price ""means a substantial part of the expected synergies were passed on to existing shareholders,"" Bischof wrote. It should result in a lower cost of equity for Axa and reinforces the firm's growth potential, he said.Use IBD's MarketSmith For Free Until March 11

9,AIG,"See stocks near a buy point, get chart pattern recognition and run custom screens. Start NowXL Group rose nearly 31% to 56.55 before New York's open on the stock market today.Axa fell as much as 10% to 22.55 euros, the lowest in a year. The shares were trading at 22.97 euros at 1:54 p.m. in Paris.Insurance premiums had been falling for most of the past decade, driven by a lack of natural disasters and competition from hedge funds. The $306 billion of losses last year from weather-related disasters including Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria is finally leading to increases in pricing, prompting an uptick in deals.Buberl, the 44-year-old CEO, agreed the biggest-ever purchase of a U.S. insurer by a European buyer less than two years after taking the position. Bloomberg reported Saturday that Axa was in advanced talks on the deal, citing people with knowledge of the matter. XL had also attracted interest from competitors including Germany's Allianz SE, Bloomberg reported earlier.""This is not an obvious fit for Axa,"" UBS Group analyst Colm Kelly wrote in a note to clients. In recent years, ""Axa has grown via bolt-on acquisitions to achieve scale, not large-scale M&A.""The deal does chime with Buberl's plan to focus on products that require technical expertise and regular customer contact, which may allow the firm sell additional policies to the clients. It will lead to annual pretax synergies of $400 million and will be cash-accretive, according to Axa's statement on Monday.""From a P&C perspective, Axa needed in my view a stronger presence in the U.S."" Davide Serra, CEO of money manager Algebris Investments, said in an interview on Bloomberg Television. Focusing on that segment ""over the medium term, it's a safer bet.""The insurer plans to finance the acquisition using cash in hand, subordinated debt and proceeds from an IPO of its existing U.S. operations. It's also arranged 9 billion euros ($11 billion) of backup bridge financing.The IPO, which Axa announced last year, will see the insurer list its U.S. Life & Savings unit and its 64% stake in AllianceBernstein (AB) in the second quarter. Axa plans to accelerate its sell-off of the combined businesses following the XL deal.Companies like XL Group have become takeover targets after the heavy toll of natural disasters last year pushed prices for coverage higher. Last month, the firm's CEO Michael McGavick said he was optimistic about XL's progress on the back of a solid capital position and growth in premiums.The biggest insurance takeover this year had been January's American International Group (AIG) agreement to buy Validus Holdings Ltd. for more than $5 billion in cash. SoftBank Group wants to buy a stake in reinsurer Swiss Re AG and Phoenix Group Holdings is buying Standard Life Aberdeen's insurance business.Formerly a regional insurer in Normandy, Axa built itself into Europe's second-largest insurer through major takeovers in the 1990s. Recent deals have been smaller-scale, acquiring assets or setting up partnerships in emerging markets including China, Nigeria and Colombia.

10,AIG,"Many negative consequences flow reliably from a financial crisis, including unemployment, political turmoil, and piles of sovereign debt. Since the 2008 financial meltdown, however, we've seen none of the good consequences — and there are supposed to be good ones.XCrashes and severe recessions often are followed by bursts of innovation that lay the groundwork for several decades of future growth and productivity increases. Severe economic downturns can perform a vital cleansing for the economy, toppling unchallengeable market positions and clearing a path for newcomers with disruptive ideas. The economic transformations that followed major worldwide crashes prior to 2008 — in 1873, 1929, and 1973—were breathtaking.Yet here we are, nearly a decade after the worst financial crisis in modern memory, and we've seen few of these kinds of benefits. Don't let heady stock prices, record corporate profits, and low unemployment fool you. America is only now emerging from a lost decade. Instead of renewal, the last ten years were blighted by slow growth, stagnant productivity, limited social mobility, long-term unemployment and underemployment, and despair.No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth PerspectiveThe economic legacy of the last decade is excessive corporate consolidation, a massive transfer of wealth to the top 1% from the middle class, the creation of even more asset bubbles, and rising social tensions. America is incredibly resilient. We are not Japan. We are recovering.But the Federal Reserve Board, the government body charged with establishing the monetary conditions for economic recovery, has hampered it at every stage. The Fed is not solely responsible for America's lost decade — the impact of its misguided policies was compounded by other factors, including regulatory and congressional capture and crony capitalism.Yet the central bank did play a central role. There is little evidence to suggest that it recognizes this fact, or that recent appointments will challenge the status quo.Economic historians will debate the causes of the 2007-08 financial crisis for years, but it's clear that a flood of cheap money and a breakdown of oversight had inflated a gigantic asset bubble, the bursting of which triggered the crisis. During the boom years, no one noticed the growing problem.But things began going bad in 2007; and 2008, of course, brought catastrophe. Insisting initially that the economy had entered a normal postwar recession, the Fed acted with uncertainty, helping some big banks but allowing Lehman Brothers to fail — which brought the financial system to the brink of collapse. Ben Bernanke's Federal Reserve, along with Hank Paulson's Treasury, then acted fast to prop up the system, hoping to avoid a total meltdown.Averting a crisis was necessary. But the Fed and the Treasury did not stop there. They wound up bailing out huge Wall Street banks that contribute little to the productive ""real"" economy, along with insurers (AIG) and huge and inefficient industrial companies.Embarking on a new policy of ""quantitative easing"" to bolster the lending market, the Fed blew up its balance sheet by purchasing debt to keep interest rates down, certain that productive borrowing would ensue. Before the crash, at the end of July 2008, the Fed's assets were $0.9 trillion. By July 2017, they had ballooned to $4.5 trillion.These measures yielded little. Near-zero rates did not spur an expansion of jobs or of productivity-enhancing research. Instead, the easy money went to other uses, including the funding of mergers and acquisitions among giant companies and private-equity-sponsored, highly leveraged buyouts.It is community and regional banks, along with private credit companies and lenders, that drive growth by lending money to smaller enterprises to build out productive capacity.But the Fed and the Treasury concentrated on helping the institutions that they knew best — the mega-banks that, by 2008, had largely exited the business of lending to smaller companies and were focused on securities trading, proprietary investing, and serving large enterprises, governments, and financial institutions. The mega-banks' market share has relentlessly increased.After eight years of Fed support, plus increased concentration and wide regulatory moats, the profitability of the huge banks has more than recovered — but with what results? The overall economy saw no obvious benefit. Meantime, the community and regional banking system atrophied.In the past, the resulting loss in lending would have been filled by new, locally focused banks. This time, ultralow interest rates and expensive new regulations made starting new banks almost impossible. The number of new banks plummeted from an average of 200 each year prior to 2008 to fewer than one a year since the crash. Lending to small businesses shrank.At the same time, cheap credit helped large companies create monopolies and oligopolies across many industry segments, resulting in a level of concentration and monopoly profits in the American economy not seen in over 100 years.This, again, was not just the Federal Reserve's fault. The decline of American antitrust enforcement, going back to the 1990s — permitting levels of consolidation and anti-competitive practices that wouldn't have been tolerated 30 years ago — added to the problem, as did the smothering tangle of laws and regulations that descended on American business from every level of government, which disproportionately affected smaller, innovative firms while benefiting incumbents.In retrospect, everything that the Fed did in response to the crisis entrenched the status quo. Though the mega-banks were insolvent, the government chose not to restructure them directly and instead provided them with a ""too big to fail"" guarantee, letting them borrow at almost no cost and rebuild their capital without imposing obligations.For their part, the regional and community banks and credit companies that actually financed job creation faced substantially increased regulatory burdens and pressure to reduce their loan exposures.Further, the central bank failed to grasp the critical role of credit pipelines, which enable smaller institutions to resell loans, thereby freeing up balance-sheet capacity to make more loans. These collapsed. As well, lending between banks ground to a halt, drying up a market that provided these smaller institutions with access to liquidity, without which they had to keep more short-term assets on hand, thus further reducing their loan portfolios.Given the severity of the Great Recession, we might have expected far better. The historical pattern has been that the most severe downturns heralded the most robust recoveries. And those robust rebounds normally happened fast.  In a 2017 paper, ""Deep Recessions, Fast Recoveries, and Financial Crises: Evidence from the American Record,"" economists Michael Bordo and Joseph Haubrich write that ""recessions associated with financial crises are generally followed by rapid recoveries.""Not this time. In 2014, economist John B. Taylor, an influential scholar of monetary policy who was considered to succeed Janet Yellen as Fed chief, said that the U.S. recovery ""remains an outlier, as one of the few cases where output did not return to the level of the previous peak after the duration of the recession."" In fact, the post-2008 recovery may be the weakest that America has ever had — even compared with the post-1929 recovery.A main culprit was all that cheap money. Economist Sébastien E. J. Walker and I studied the impact of ultralow interest rates on economic growth, publishing our findings in 2012. Despite an almost religious faith among economists and central bankers in the benefits of near-zero rates, an extensive search of the literature failed to turn up any previous empirical studies showing that ultralow rates were beneficial.The conventional and unchallenged economic wisdom — the lower the rate, the greater the subsequent growth — was wrong, at least at recent rate levels. It's true that, when adjusted for other variables, lower real interest rates were associated with faster economic growth in subsequent periods — but only up to a point.Contrary to expectations, rates below the normal rate actually retarded subsequent growth. The relationship between real interest rates and subsequent economic growth is defined by a curve, not an upward sloping line.Ultralow rates ease the pressure on enterprises to adopt productivity-enhancing innovations, restructure inefficient operations, and dispose of unproductive assets. That's a major reason that productivity growth has been so poor.Ultralow rates also distort capital allocation. Governments overborrow, and large corporations favor debt over equity in their capital mix. Speculation abounds. Yet because of the bifurcation of the credit markets caused by the withdrawal of smaller lending institutions, interest rates are far from zero for small and medium-size businesses, which, through this entire period, have paid relatively high rates.Job growth historically has come from innovative new enterprises. The number of new firms has fallen substantially since the crash. The percentage of employment in start-ups has dropped dramatically.Limited access to credit by smaller enterprises is a factor in this decline, as are the intertwined constraints of low growth prospects, high costs of regulation and health care, and difficulties penetrating markets against entrenched players and limited incentives for many customers to change.Yet positive change seems to be arriving at last. In Washington, the Trump administration is pushing to dismantle costly regulations that affect business. The ideological tide regarding antitrust interventions is shifting, even at the University of Chicago. Corporate taxes have been slashed, perhaps leading to repatriation of offshore funds. The state and local tax (SALT) deduction, which largely benefits the rich (and public employees) in places like New York, is being reduced or eliminated.Despite the effects of counterproductive policies, the U.S. economy looks poised once again to embark on an innovation surge of historic proportions, one that will disrupt established players, generate substantial returns for investors, and improve the lives of working Americans.The technological foundation for historic change is already in place. The adaptability of on-demand Internet services, for example, which has already reshaped the taxi industry, will soon have similar effects on many other industries.The Internet has penetrated almost every sector of society, and rapid advances in miniaturization have driven staggering increases in the computing power, bandwidth, and cloud storage that a dollar will buy.Global bandwidth, storage, and processing capabilities increase a thousandfold each decade. That is a millionfold increase in capability since the last great wave of innovation, in the late 1990s.  Data storage is now virtually free, enabling a vast range of cloud and hybrid applications. Artificial intelligence is evolving rapidly.Perhaps the most far-reaching innovations will occur in medicine, with the cheap digitization of genetics, and in business services, where enterprise-scale information technology, still operating in large part on legacy systems, will soon be replaced by advanced frameworks that can help corporations put their data to productive use, reduce expenses, and improve overall efficiency. These systems are likely to be more secure and far cheaper and easier to operate.There was hope that President Trump would nominate a new Fed leader (to replace outgoing chair Yellen) who would depart from the policies of the past decade. Unfortunately, Trump's choice of current Fed governor Jerome Powell as the central bank's new chairman is not likely to result in fundamental policy change.As the Washington Post reports, ""Powell is widely expected to keep Yellen's tactics largely in place, albeit with a bit more of a Wall Street touch."" More of a ""Wall Street touch"" is precisely what we don't need. The next chair would best serve the American people by bringing a missing Main Street touch to the Fed and working with other agencies to rebuild the lending infrastructure for growing smaller businesses.One way or another, though, the Fed's protracted experiment with ultralow rates is going to end. Fed or no Fed, the next big boom seems about to burst forth. Americans remain the world's best creative destructionists.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

11,AIG,"Here's Your Investing Action Plan: what you need to know for Wednesday and beyond.Earnings season gets underway in earnest with reports from Delta Air Lines (DAL) on Wednesday and banking giants such as Citigroup (C) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) later this week.XFor the third quarter as whole, S&P 500 earnings are expected to grow 2% from the same period last year on a 5% revenue gain, according to Zacks Investment Research. That follows double-digit profit growth in the first two quarters of 2017.The technology sector should earnings up nearly 10% as revenue grows 7%. While flagship names Apple (AAPL) and Facebook (FB) will step up to the dock as November dawns, smaller names like Barracuda Networks (CUDA), out Tuesday night, are on tap this week.Estimates for the financial sector have notably worsened over the last two months, as last quarter's back-to-back hurricanes weigh on corporate profits, especially on insurers and reinsurers such as Travelers (TRV), American International Group (AIG), Chubb (CB) and Everest Re (RE).Insurers, who account for a quarter of the finance sector's total earnings, are expected to see earnings decline 25% vs. a year ago, contributing to a dip in Q3 earnings for the broad financial sector, according to Zacks.But both Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase are estimated to grow adjusted profits and sales in the September quarter when they report Thursday.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter.The impact of the storms on insurers may already be priced in, with AIG moving back toward a buy point of 67.57 after bottoming in early September and Progressive (PGR) crossing a 49.11 buy point off a flat base.Transporters and air carriers are also likely to see a hurricane-related knock on profit growth, but Delta Air Lines added 1.9% on the stock market today as the stock moves toward a 55.85 buy point ahead of the carrier's report on Wednesday.Analysts call for Delta earnings to shrink 9% to $1.54 as revenue rises 5% to $11.04 billion, Zacks said. Delta already has reported strong preliminary Q3 unit revenue figures, with United Airlines (UAL) and American Airlines (AAL) following suit on Tuesday.Finally, small-cap companies, which are not part of the S&P 500, should see earnings growth return in Q3. For the S&P 600 index as a whole, earnings are expected to be up 11% vs. a year ago on 5% higher revenue, snapping a run of earnings declines in three of the last four quarters.Small-cap stocks also have been leading in recent months.The finance, technology and energy sectors are likely to drive small-cap growth. Without the finance sector's contribution, small caps' Q3 earnings would drop 0.3%.RELATED:American, United Airlines Jump On Strong Q3 Unit Revenue; Delta On TapWal-Mart Sees 40% Online Sales Jump, Sets $20 Billion BuybackMove Over Techs, There's A New Sector Leader On Wall StreetNvidia Shares Jump As It Debuts Computer For Self-Driving Cars

12,AIG,"Property and casualty insurance stocks such as Progressive (PGR), Allstate (ALL), Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) and AIG (AIG) are on the decline Monday in the wake of Hurricane Harvey's landfall in Texas on Friday.XHarvey has since been downgraded to a tropical storm from Category 4, but acting Homeland Security Secretary Elaine Duke told the Washington Post on Monday that ""we are not out of the woods yet,"" and said Harvey ""is still a dangerous and historic storm.""Officials estimate that about 30,000 people will be forced from their homes, said the outlet. The hurricane has so far reportedly resulted in at least five deaths and more than a dozen injuries.Analysts and insurance executives said the industry has enough capital to withstand losses incurred from claims resulting from the storm, according to the Wall Street Journal.On Monday, Hannover Re told Reuters that the damage Harvey has wrought is projected to be well below the impact of 2005's Katrina ($80 billion) and 2012's Sandy ($36 billion).IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.But the Insurance Information Institute said the flood damage caused by Harvey in Texas could match Katrina's impact, according to a separate Reuters story Sunday.Progressive shares were down 2.6% on the stock market today, but remains well above buy range, Allstate fell 1.2% to 90.89, threatening to drop below its buy zone and 50-day average, and Travelers (TRV) dropped 2.7%.AIG lost 0.8%, Berkshire Hathaway dipped 0.5%, and Chubb Limited (CB) fell 1.3%.RELATED:Stock Futures Climb As Houston Flooding WorsensProgressive Joins Rank Of Stocks With 95-Plus Composite RatingBerkshire Hathaway Outbid By Sempra For Oncor Electric Delivery

13,AIG,"Are there any mutual funds that hold Dow Jones Industrial stocks like Boeing (BA), McDonald's (MCD) and Caterpillar (CAT) and also beat the broad stock market in both total return and yield?For many investors — especially people interested in retirement income — finding a mutual fund whose total return and yield top the stock market is the holy grail of investing.You can find such stock mutual funds. One place to look is among top-performing dividend-oriented stock funds. Several hold leading stocks that are approaching buy points or are within buy ranges.But be wary of dividend stock mutual funds that have only outperformed over relatively short recent periods.For example, the broad market measured by the S&P 500 scored a total return — share-price gain plus income — of 11.56% this year through July 24. The $93.1 billion American Capital World Growth & Income Fund (CWGIX), just to name one, did much better, galloping ahead 16.26%, according to Morningstar Inc. It holds Boeing along with many other stocks with attractive yield.But how risky would it be to bet on that fund going forward? World Growth & Income's longer-term performance is not as impressive as its year-to-date performance. Its five-year and 10-year average annual gains of 12.35% and 4.62% both lag the S&P 500's 15.47% and 7.33%.So, rather than looking for a fund that outperformed over a short recent period, look for long-term, consistent outperformers.Check out dividend-oriented stock mutual funds that have existed for at least 10 years. And consider confining your search to funds that have at least $100 million in shareholder assets. Those funds have survived long enough and satisfied enough shareholders to show that they are not unproven flash-in-the-pan portfolios.There are 544 such funds. And 61 of them average an annual total return higher than the S&P 500's in the past 10 years.That group's average 12-month yield is 1.59%. That lags the bogey's 1.91%, measured by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY).Still, some individual stock mutual funds among those 61 outperformers do have 12-month yield that tops the S&P 500's.The three with the best 10-year average annual returns, whose yields also top the S&P 500's, are $1.1 billion Pimco StocksPlus Small (PSCSX), up an average of 12.07% a year; $1.4 billion Hennessy Gas Utility (GASFX), up 9.09% on average; and $13.9 billion AIG Focused Dividend Strategy (FDSAX), with a 9.07% average yearly gain. Their yields range from 2.36% by Hennessy to 4.33% for Pimco.The AIG fund, whose yield is 2.93%, holds stocks such as Boeing (BA), which is up 53% this year through Aug. 2. The aerospace manufacturer and defense contractor sports a 93 Composite Rating from IBD. Composite Ratings range from 1-99. Stocks poised to move higher often have a Comp Rating of 95 or higher.And Boeing is a member of the IBD 50 list of stocks with strong relative price strength and fundamentals.In addition, the stock has a dividend yield of 2.4%. It has boosted dividends five years in a row, according to dividend.com.AIG Focused Dividend also owns McDonald's, which is up 30% this year and yielding 2.4% and Caterpillar, up 24% and yielding 2.8%.Caterpiller is looking for a rebound in earnings, with analysts expecting growth of 51% and 24% this year and next following an average decline of 21% the past three years.The $522 million Nicholas Equity Income (NSEIX) is yet another one of the 61 funds whose 10-year average annual return and its current 12-month yield are better than the S&P 500's. The fund's yearly return over the decade is 8.54%. Its 12-month yield is 3.32%.One of the stocks helping Equity Income is PNC Financial Services (PNC). The bank holding company stock has a 2.3% dividend yield. Up 11% this year, shares are trading around 130 and are approaching a 131.93 entry point.Microchip Technology (MCHP) is another holding. Brian Demain, manager of $14.2 billion Janus Henderson Enterprise Fund (JANEX) — which also holds Microchip Technology but is not a dividend-focused fund — recently told IBD that the company gets most of its revenue from microcontrollers, which are very simple computers that are used in a wide variety of products. That diversification gives the company sustainable growth.Evidence of that is the company's earnings per share growth, which has accelerated for six quarters in a row.The stock has a dividend yield of 1.8%. Shares are up 24% this year. The stock, which has a 98 Comp Rating and an excellent A SMR Rating from IBD, is up 24% this year. That means it is in the top 20% of stocks in terms of sales growth, profit margins and return on equity ratios, based on IBD's proprietary formula.Trading around 80, the stock is below an 87.59 entry.The $32.2 billion Vanguard Dividend Growth (VDIGX) has gained at a yearly average of 8.07% over the past decade. Its current 12-month yield is 2%.Microsoft (MSFT) is one holding. The software giant, which has a 95 Comp Rating, is up 16% this year. Its dividend yield is 2.2%. After pulling back for the past week, the stock is slightly below its 72.99 buy point in a flat base.  RELATED:You Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And IncomeHot Stocks Owned By Top-Performing Stock Mutual Funds

14,AIG,"When the next financial crisis hits — an event that may be years or decades away — we will learn whether this Congress and the president drew the right lessons from the 2008-09 financial crisis. Congress is arguing over whether government can avoid ""bailouts"" of large financial institutions and still prevent a full-blown crisis. With all of President Trump's trials and tribulations, hardly anyone is paying attention.The debate goes to the heart of the government's role in the financial system. During the 2008-09 crisis, the Federal Reserve, Treasury and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) rescued a variety of large financial institutions, including the insurance company AIG, Citigroup, and many banks and lenders. But the rescue provoked a public backlash; many Americans felt that Wall Street was protected while Main Street wasn't.To address this complaint, the Dodd-Frank law — the Obama administration's response to the financial crisis — created a complicated system under which troubled financial institutions could borrow temporarily from the Treasury (via the FDIC). This would, arguably, prevent a panic, as these institutions would otherwise lack the money to repay their lenders. But ultimately, these shaky institutions would be broken up, with their viable segments preserved or sold to other firms and the rest shuttered.Among banking experts, the process is referred to as Orderly Liquidation Authority, or OLA. It seems a complex solution to a complex problem. Yet, it did not convince skeptics, who argued that for all its twists and turns, OLA would simply be another mechanism to bail out mismanaged banks and financial institutions. A better solution and a sure-fire defense against bailouts, retorted the skeptics, would be to put collapsing financial institutions into legal bankruptcy, where they would be closed or reorganized.So that's what the Republican majority of the House Financial Services Committee did in May. There would be no borrowing from the Treasury. Troubled firms would go straight into bankruptcy. End of story? No. A letter from 122 law professors and economists, led by Jeffrey N. Gordon of the Columbia Law School and Mark J. Roe of the Harvard Law School, argued that the House proposal is unworkable and could trigger the panic that the legislation aimed to avoid.The bankruptcy of one major firm isn't the main threat. The larger danger is ""a financial crisis that threatens the economy (and involves) multiple institutions failing or tottering simultaneously,"" said the letter. The ""American economy will need a coordinated response, particularly if the entire financial system suffers a panic or lack of liquidity."" Bankruptcy judges cannot provide this response. It is best left to the Treasury, Federal Reserve and FDIC.Earlier, Ben Bernanke — chairman of the Federal Reserve Board during the financial crisis — made similar points on his blog. He also denied that OLA represented a bank bailout, because ""all losses are borne by the private sector."" Shareholders would almost certainly be wiped out; top managers would lose their jobs. If government loans could not be repaid, there would be a financial assessment on healthier financial institutions to fill the gap.This is an enormously important debate. We shouldn't gut Dodd-Frank unless the critics can make the case that what they propose is demonstrably better. They haven't yet.

17,AIG,"When it comes to long-term performance, less than 60 basis points separates the top five performing international stock mutual funds in the IBD Best Mutual Funds 2017 Awards list in IBD's 2017 survey of the best and brightest active fund managers.But one thing is common: All five mauled the scrawny return of the MSCI EAFE (Europe, Australasia and Far East) equity benchmark.Each award winner beat the benchmark in the last year, the past three, five and 10 years. Award winners were ranked by 10-year average annual returns with the top five earning recognition as the best of the best.The $2 billion Thornburg Global Opportunities I(THOIX) ranked 1st among 438 funds having a 10-year track record, showing an annual average return of 7.95%. That's more than 10 times the 0.75% gain for MSCI EAFE over the same time frame.Matthews Asia Dividend Fund(MAPIX) was 2nd with a 7.60% return, followed by Morgan Stanley Institutional Global Franchise (IMSFAX) at 7.46%, Oppenheimer Global Opportunities Class A(OPGIX) 7.40% and Oakmark Global Select(OAKWX) 7.39%.Four of the top five performers searched the entire globe for good stocks. Just one, Matthews Asia Dividend Investor, focuses on the Asia and Pacific region; in fact, the $5 billion fund must invest at least 80% of total assets in dividend-paying equity securities of companies located in Asia.Why has Thornburg done well?Contrary to its name, the fund actually takes a larger stake in U.S. companies than you might think. Historically, American companies have made up 30% to 50% of the entire portfolio. Emerging markets have taken up just 5% to 20%.As of Jan. 31, indeed, the U.S. comprised 45.1% of the entire fund. Netherlands was 2nd at 14%, followed by the U.K. at 9.1%, China 8.1%, Spain 7.6% and Ireland 5.5%. All other countries make up less than 3% of the portfolio.The fund prefers to concentrate its holdings in 30 to 40 positions. The typical global fund has more than three times as many. ""We know what we own, and why own it"" is one of the fund's mantras.So is finding value.Look at the top 10 holdings and the active equity investor will recognize plenty of names. At the top is integrated Level 3 Communications (LVLT), followed by wireless telecom play T-Mobile USA (TMUS). Candy, chocolate and cheese maker Mondelez (MDLZ), Chinese internet search giant Baidu (BIDU) and global banking franchise Citigroup (C) also make up part of the top 10.""We are global value investors,"" says Vinson Walden, according to Thornburg.com. ""We use a value-based research process to identify quality businesses at attractive prices around the world.""Broomfield, Colo.-based Level 3 sells network access to telecom providers. At about 57, shares trade a hefty 28 times fiscal year 2016 earnings. However, Level 3's peak P-E ratio over the past five years is 70.Baidu, one of the hottest Chinese ADRs in the U.S. following the market bottom in 2009, also does not seem cheap. At 173, the stock trades 30 times its FY 2016 earnings of $5.66 a share. However, Wall Street sees earnings rising to $7.54 a share by 2018 after a slight dip in 2017.Like Thornburg Global Opportunities, the $4.1 billion Oppenheimer Global Opportunities carries a heavy weighting on the U.S., which makes up 47.6% of the entire fund as of Jan. 31. Next is the U.K. at 12.6%. But Oppenheimer differs from Thornburg in its next three largest weightings: Denmark at 8.5%, Germany 8.5% and Japan 6.0%.One major Oppenheimer holding that hails from Denmark is the biotech Genmab, the fourth-largest holding in the fund with a 2.9% weighting as of Jan. 31. Genmab develops therapies for cancer and other diseases including multiple sclerosis.According to the global equities database of William O'Neil + Co., Genmab turned profitable in 2012, earning 2.20 Danish krone per share. Earnings have risen every year since then and are up nearly 10-fold to 19.83 krone a share in 2016.The stock broke out of a long cup with handle base at 257.10 krone in the final week of October in 2014. Genmab rose 15 weeks in a row before cooling off and forming a new cup-with-handle pattern from July to October 2015. Genmab eventually broke out again and is now near 1,443.Other top holdings in the Oppenheimer fund include U.S.-based Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) at a 5.2% weighting, laser and precision optical device maker Coherent (COHR) at 3.6% and semiconductor manufacturing equipment titan Applied Materials (AMAT) at 1.7%.Meanwhile, the $2.2 billion Oakmark Global Select fund has juiced its returns partly due to some timely and big bets on the banks and other financial institutions. Bank of America (BAC) is the biggest investment, taking up 6.8% of the fund's assets as of Dec. 31, 2016.Credit Suisse (CS) is also a hefty holding at 5.8%, followed by the insurance giant American International Group (AIG) at 5.5% and Citigroup (C) at 5.1%. Together, those four stocks make up nearly a quarter of the fund.Switzerland-based Credit Suisse and New York-based Citi clearly have operations around the world and are known as a banker to corporations and large institutions as well as high net worth individuals. But Citi is also a play on the rising middle class across many emerging market economies. According to its Q4 2016 report, Citigroup posted $3.36 billion in adjusted revenue from Asia, $2.65 billion from the EMEA region (Europe, Middle East, Africa) and $2.23 billion from Latin America. Together, they equaled $8.24 billion, or 50% of total adjusted revenue of $16.36 billion.RELATED:Top Global Mutual Funds: Why India Mattered In The 2016 Big WinnersHow To Invest: Top Global Stocks Trading In The U.S. TodayHow To Trade Index ETFs: Making Money With IBD's Results-Proven Stock Market Timing Mechanism

22,AIG,"Half of the 18 components of IBD's ETF Sector Rotation index are financials, which gives you an idea just how strong the sector has been performing.One of the new faces in that batch is iShares U.S. Financial Services (IYG), a fund with a more-diversified profile than the various banking ETFs in the index, but one that still draws most of its strength from banks.Nearly 60% of the fund is in big banks such as Wells Fargo (WFC), Citigroup (C) and Bank of America (BAC) plus many small regional players. But the fund expands its scope with more than 30% of holdings in financial services firms such as NYSE operator Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) and BlackRock (BLK), which happens to be the parent of the iShares family of ETFs.About 10% of the portfolio is categorized as software, where credit card companies Visa (V) and MasterCard (MA) are found.The fund differs from its larger cousin, the Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF), in a couple of significant ways. Financial Select Sector has about two-thirds as many holdings and they're generally bigger stocks. The average market cap for Financial Select Sector is $89.6 billion, compared with $69.5 billion for iShares U.S. Financial, according to Morningstar.A great many of the 110 stocks in the iShares fund are near the 10-week moving average, including most of the largest holdings. Similarly, iShares U.S. Financial Services is testing support as it pulls back to the 10-week moving average. A rebound from its current level would create a buy area for the ETF.The outlook for the financial sector is improving, as the first round of earnings has been mostly favorable. But uncertainly over tax proposals rattled bank stocks the past week.Financial are reporting the second-highest earnings growth of all 11 S&P sectors, 16.2% as of a week ago, according to a report from FactSet Research. Insurance companies are expected to have the highest earnings growth at 45%, followed by Capital Markets at 29%.""At the company level, AIG (AIG), Goldman Sachs (GS), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America are the largest contributors to earnings growth for this sector,"" FactSet noted.But financial stocks have been following a couple of other important trends. First, bond yields have been climbing as the Federal Reserve weans the U.S. economy off an easy monetary policy. Second, Republicans in Congress have a chance to unwind or eliminate regulations that have dampened bank profits.

24,AIG,"In June, Investor's Corner covered the basics of a bottoming base pattern.In that story, IBD presented Under Armour (UA) as a stock that hit bottom in March 2009, rallied, took another brief spill, then formed a sound flat base more than a year and a half after the March 2009 lows.A savvy investor needed patience for the Baltimore-based sports apparel innovator to find its footing and then hit its stride by breaking out and rushing to 52-week highs. Yet in other cases, the bottoming base may take less time. So be nimble. You might not need to wait many months, let alone years, to find a golden apple.William O'Neil, who founded IBD in 1984, presented Apple (AAPL) during a two-day CAN SLIM Masters Certification seminar in Santa Monica in June 2010. Apple broke out more quickly from its bottoming base. It also revealed a subtle clue of how a future leader acts when the market is in free-fall.The S&P 500 slid nearly nine weeks in a row from early January to March 2009. The bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in the fall of 2008 and the near collapse of insurer American International Group (AIG) symbolized the mortgage debt crisis. New business orders, lending and jobs came to a halt.Over that nine-week maelstrom of selling, the S&P 500 fell more than 28%. It also undercut a 52-week low of 741 marked in November 2008 (1). During the week ended Nov. 21, Apple also reached new lows; at 79.14, the iPhone maker dropped 61% below its then all-time peak of 202.96. Nine weeks later, Apple tested that low.But in the week ended March 6, 2009, even as the S&P 500 careened lower, undercutting the 741 low (2), Apple held above its recent lows (3) and reversed higher. That was a truly subtle clue of strength.On March 12, 2009, the S&P followed through, rising 4.1% in heavier volume on Day 5 of a fledgling new advance. A follow-through signals that the market may be ready to turn.Turn it did. Just four months later, Apple roared out of a five-week flat base buy point at 146.50 on July 15 in light trade. Turnover accelerated over the next few weeks. By October 2011, Apple hit a high of 426, up 191%.RELATED:Know This Chart Pattern: Under Armour's Bottoming Base In 2010Using Stock Charts Correctly: How To Use Daily And Weekly Charts TogetherThe 2-Minute Tip: IBD Videos On Smart Growth Investing

26,AIG,"When Paul Volcker said the last financial innovation that improved society was the automated teller machine, Robert C. Merton took offense.Now the Nobel Prize-winning professor is hitting back, pointing to markets for options and interest-rate swaps that are humming along as fast as ever. He says Warren Buffett's remark that derivatives are ""financial weapons of mass destruction"" was taken out of context by those who want to banish them, when a better solution is to make them safer without sacrificing their advantages.For Merton, it's personal. A year after he won the Nobel in 1997 for his work on pricing options, Long-Term Capital Management, a hedge fund where he was a director, had to be bailed out after leveraged bets on derivatives went sour. Then came the 2008 crisis, where collateralized debt obligations and credit-default swaps took some of the blame. Still, the 72-year-old says, that's no reason to abandon the tools.There are ""enormous gains from financial innovation and finance science,"" Merton, who teaches at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Mass., said in an interview during a visit to Kyoto, Japan. ""We need to find a way to realize those gains.""Eight years after the financial crisis, there's little evidence of a falloff in trader appetite for the instruments that Merton pioneered. More than 3 billion equity options have changed hands on U.S. exchanges in 2016, and a record 4.5 billion were sold in 2011. Total notional volume for interest-rate derivatives rose to $2.7 trillion per day from $2.3 trillion in 2013, including swaps, forwards and options, the Bank for International Settlements said last month.In the interview, Merton looked back on the 1970s, when market turbulence was spurred by oil shocks and the collapse of the Bretton Woods system of fixed currencies. He said the crises of that era led to inventions that still have benefits today.He lists the creation of the options market for hedging investments as one example. Another was swaps, which he says eliminated interest-rate risk for lenders practically overnight, stopping many of them from going insolvent every time rates moved.""Do you know when the ATM was invented? 1969,"" he said. ""So if that statement held, it means that everything that happened in the 1970s and beyond was not useful to society. I think my list kind of suggests that that's not very accurate,"" referring to comments by former Federal Reserve Chairman Volcker in 2009.Useful or not, some instruments on Merton's list had at least a passive role in speculation that nearly collapsed the world economy in 2008. Put options priced according to his formulas are the forefather of credit default swaps, a market that had swollen to $62 trillion at the end of 2007, according to the International Swaps & Derivatives Association.""I hear about these wonderful innovations in the financial markets, and they sure as hell need a lot of innovation,"" Volcker said at a Wall Street Journal event in 2009. ""I can tell you of two — credit-default swaps and collateralized debt obligations — which took us right to the brink of disaster.""Merton defended credit-default swaps, saying they're even an important tool for big manufacturers who need to provide financing to risky companies to sell their products. The problem, he says, wasn't with the contracts but with the providers, such as American International Group (AIG), who took on too much risk in selling them.After the failure of Lehman Brothers and the government rescue of AIG, policymakers pushed to reduce counterparty risk in the privately negotiated derivatives markets by requiring trades to be moved into central clearinghouses, which are collateralized by dealers. For trades not cleared, rules are also being created to require trading partners to exchange collateral that stands behind the trades.For Merton, financial institutions and regulators lost trust during the financial crisis, both by being incompetent and acting in bad faith. He says regulators have to be able to understand the complex markets they oversee, and they should be paid more if necessary to attract the best people. But while ""fools and knaves"" exist in all industries, he disagrees with the theory that most of Wall Street is motivated only by greed.""Most of the people I know in the profession or in academia take their jobs seriously, are not interested in ripping off the public, are not crooks, are not unethical,"" said Merton, who's also resident scientist at Dimensional Holdings. ""That's not the majority of people.""In Berkshire Hathaway's (BRKA) annual report for 2002, Buffett wrote that he saw derivatives as ""financial weapons of mass destruction,"" with the potential to have a domino effect on the economic system when one weak institution fails. Central banks have found no way to control or monitor the risks associated with them, he wrote.""He uses derivatives all the time,"" said Merton. ""I don't believe it's because Warren Buffett's a hypocrite. I believe they've conveniently misinterpreted his quote out of the context in which he made it. You can ask him. And it's very interesting, nobody wants to ask him. It's too good a thing to be able to keep coming back to.""Buffett didn't respond to a request for comment sent to an assistant. Berkshire Hathaway paid $195 million in July to wind down its last credit derivatives contract, according to a regulatory filing. Berkshire still has some derivatives tied to the performance of stock indexes.Merton says MIT is seeking to train more people who can understand the complexities of derivatives today. He says he's been working for much of the past 12 years on ways to help pension savers better fund their retirements, which is another important use of financial innovation, especially in the current low-rate environment. And while mistakes have been made, that's no reason to go back to a world with just stock and bond markets.""If there were no benefits, it's easy, just don't do it,"" he said. But ""there's a huge amount of value to be created for society using these technologies.""

27,AIG,"Will corporate spending on cybersecurity insurance siphon away budget dollars from security technology?Insurance companies led by American International Group (AIG), Chubb (CB), Beazley and Axis Capital are eyeing the cybersecurity market. Security providers such as Cisco Systems (CSCO), IBM (IBM), Palo Alto Networks (PANW) and Check Point Software (CHKP) are paying attention.Many companies are interested in coverage for ""business interruption"" losses, if computer systems or data are unavailable due to an attack. They are finding that coverage, while other cybersecurity insurance plans cover destruction of data and property and ""reputational harm."" Theft of intellectual property, however, often is not included in such coverage, with too many unknowns for insurers.Inadequate coverage and expensive premiums keep many companies from buying cybersecurity insurance, analysts say, but they also say such coverage is improving and gaining more customers.IBD'S TAKE: At No. 56, IBD's Computer Software-Security industry group doesn't have a high enough ranking among the 197 groups that IBD tracks to warrant too much attention. But there are always areas worth attention, and one way to hone your skills is to take some lessons from IBD University on how to buy stocks.Consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers sees big growth. It estimates that total cybersecurity premiums will skyrocket to $7.5 billion in 2020 from $2.5 billion in 2015. That estimate might be low. Aon Benfield, a reinsurance broker, says cybersecurity insurance premiums will reach at least $10 billion by 2020. Insurance broker March & McLennan estimates that the cyberinsurance market — which includes coverage for business interruption, reputational harm and much more — could multiply by ""three to five times"" by 2020 from about $2 billion in 2014.The growth projections have put security technology providers on alert, but worries that cybersecurity insurance will lower spending on security technology might be overblown, says Rob Ayoub, an analyst at research firm IDC.""There's been wild theories that companies are going to chuck security out the window,"" Ayoub told IBD. ""Companies may spend less, depending on what's covered (in their cyberinsurance). But when you think of fire insurance: Just because you have fire insurance doesn't mean that you don't spend on smoke alarms or fire extinguishers, right?""Cyberinsurance may be part of the equation, but it's not a replacement for security.""Cybersecurity insurance is still evolving and most companies are evaluating how much to spend on network security vs. insurance, and what types or levels of coverage to have.If companies buy insurance, they still have reasons to keep investing in security technology. One big reason would be to get lower insurance rates. Companies might be able to buy cybersecurity insurance at lower rates by demonstrating that they've upgraded to the newest software or that they comply with industry ""state-of-the-art"" practices to deter cyberattacks.IBD's 26-company Computer Software-Security industry group ranks No. 56 out of 197 groups, with Palo Alto, Barracuda Networks (CUDA) and Proofpoint (PFPT) among the stocks with the highest IBD Composite Ratings.Corporate spending on security has been growing at about a 6% annual rate, but it usually remains at just 4% to 10% of overall IT budgets, analysts say.Spending on security technologies topped $78 billion last year, says research firm Gartner. After a slew of high-profile data breaches in 2013-14 targeting such companies as Sony (SNE) Pictures and retailer Target (TGT), many companies rushed to buy security technology. That uptick in ""crisis spending"" drove security software stocks to fresh highs in mid-2015. But spending growth on security software has slowed in the past 18 months as companies reassess priorities and fewer big breaches have surfaced.Rand Corp. in September released a study claiming that the average cost of corporate data breaches is less than $200,000, not the millions of dollars that might justify higher spending on technology.But for big companies that fear the really big losses, cybersecurity insurance has limits. A Morgan Stanley study said coverage limits top out near $35 million, though other sources have said $50 million or more.Chief financial officers and boards of directors are getting more involved in setting security budgets, which generally remain under the purview of chief information officers. CFOs might prefer insurance to a bigger security budget.""At some point, enterprises will allocate incremental budget to insurance to protect against catastrophic events rather than keep on building stronger cyber technology,"" said Keith Weiss, a Morgan Stanley analyst, in a recent research report. ""However, this market is still emerging, with insurance companies tackling the challenge in quantifying and pricing for potential cyber-risk.""One problem for insurance firms, says a PwC report, is a lack of actuarial data when it comes to data breaches. In the automobile insurance market, statistics are used to calculate the risk of various car models being stolen, for example. In cybersecurity, new companies aim to provide threat-trend analytics to insurance firms, not easy when many corporate victims prefer to keep smaller breaches out of the public eye.""There isn't enough historical data to gauge losses resulting from brand impairment or compensation to customers or suppliers,"" said PwC.The PwC report says that because data breaches can remain undetected for several months or even years, potential losses are hard to estimate.Some industries, such as retail and health care, face higher premiums due to potential exposure of customer data. Ultimately, though, more companies may get coverage as cyber-risk models are developed.The devil will be in the details of cybercoverage. Insurance may cover cyberattacks by organized crime rings or ""super-hackers,"" but probably not state-sponsored ones from China or Russia because of the issues involved. And liability coverage in the cybersecurity insurance realm remains limited and varies according to company and industry, observers say.In Congress, Rep. Ed Perlmutter, D.-Colo., in September introduced a bill offering a tax deduction of 15% on the costs of cyberinsurance, but the measure hasn't progressed.Jonathan Ho, an analyst at William Blair & Co. who follows Palo Alto Networks, Fortinet (FTNT), CyberArk Software (CYBR) and other cybersecurity vendors, says cybersecurity insurance will become an normal piece of a company's risk management.""Cyberinsurance is something companies will consider separately as part of risk management,"" he said. ""It doesn't remove the responsibility of trying to defend an organization to the best of your ability.""Making cybersecurity investments still makes sense. Some data losses have been in the hundreds of millions of dollars.""RELATED:Proofpoint 'Continues To Separate From Security Pack'Palo Alto Networks, Proofpoint, CyberArk In FavorIs Cybersecurity Supercycle Over?

28,AIG,"When the mortgage crisis of 2008 hit financial markets, providers of mortgage insurance were heavily damaged. With balance sheets poisoned by defaults, IBD's property, casualty and title insurance industry group (which includes mortgage insurers) lost more than half its value from a peak in July 2007 to the low in March 2009. But Essent Group (ESNT) escaped the crisis because…

29,AIG,"Two heads can be better than one. Or, if not better, at least less volatile. For proof, look no further than $25.6 billion Fidelity Advisor New Insights Fund (FNIAX).The $25.6 billion portfolio, which is sold through financial advisors, is up 4.75% this year going into Monday. Its stablemate is $108.5 billion Contrafund (FCNTX). Both funds have marquee manager Will Danoff at the helm. New Insights — once a clone of Contrafund — has behaved differently since John Roth became co-manager three years ago.Contrafund's 9.27% average annual gain ranks in the top 1% of large-cap growth funds tracked by Morningstar Inc. over the past 15 years. New Insight's 7.95% ranks in the top 38% over the past 10 years. But so far this year New Insights 4.75% gain is in the top 14% of the same peer group vs. top 38% for Contrafund's 2.62% gain.Roth's portfolio picks go a long way to explaining why two top-notch funds, sharing a lead manager, have performed differently in the short term. Roth and Danoff talk together a lot and powwow formally once a week. But they run separate sleeves of Insights' securities.Differences in their picks add diversification. ""That gives us more ability to weather volatility,"" Roth said.On Friday, New Insights had a trio of 2%-plus gainers, as Netflix (NFLX), Tesla Motors (TSLA) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH) each tacked on more than two percentage points.Netflix announced a deal last week with Liberty Global (LBTYA) to expand its global footprint. That's a key goal as the company nears saturation in the U.S. Customers of the jumbo global cable operator will be able to access Netflix content via Liberty set top boxes, but Netflix will retain a billing relationship with viewers. Netflix has recently announced other deals with other cable operators, including Comcast (CMCSA). And this month it is slated to become the exclusive viewing platform for certain films made by Walt Disney (DIS).Tesla rose amid an intensifying friction with former BFF (best friends forever, as the kids say) Mobileye (MBLY). Tesla accused Mobileye of trying to throw a monkey wrench into its efforts to develop vision chips on its own. Mobileye said it ended its relationship with Tesla in July because the electric car maker was ""pushing the envelope in terms of safety.""Tesla said Mobileye bailed because Tesla was planning to rely more on radar systems and less on camera-based driver-assistance systems such as those developed by Mobileye.IBD'S TAKE: Our Ed Carson digs into details of the spiraling cat fight between Tesla and Mobileye in this report.Tesla's 6% share price surge Friday -- lifting it 6% for the entire week -- and Mobileye's pullback show which side investors favor in this feud.New Insights owns both stocks.As for UnitedHealth, its Friday rise was on good volume. The stock is shaping a flat base with a 144.58 buy point.IBD'S TAKE: To learn more about UnitedHealth's prognosis, see how it stacks up against other stocks in its industry at IBD's Stock Checkup.Roth says some stocks he likes today reflect his past experiences at the helms of Fidelity's sector funds focused on multimedia, chemicals and utilities. ""I'm opportunistic, with a growth bias and a valuation sensibility,"" he said.Roth, who also runs $3 billion New Millennium (FMILX), says he prefers fewer stocks in his sleeve of New Insights than Danoff. He also tilts more to midcaps. His eye on valuation recently has led Roth to beaten-down names in energy and financials.Among the names in New Insights that are not in Contrafund, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence: American International Group (AIG), Anadarko Petroleum (APC), Antero Resources (AR), Cabot Oil & Gas (COG), Chevron (CVX), Energy Transfer Equity (ETE), Exelon (EXC) and Morgan Stanley (MS).""I'm more of the energy guy,"" Roth said. ""I do think there are points in time when you want different cyclical groups.""Share prices of most of the energy names, for example, have yet to perk up a lot. But Roth says the conditions for a rebound are falling into place. U.S. production is sliding, he says, adding, ""Share prices are down, demand (for energy) is relatively good and we've seen a massive amount of capital come out of the space over the past 12 to 18 months. Rig count is down 40% to 60%. Hundreds of billions of dollars in exploration-and-production cap ex has come out.""Roth describes his thesis as of his latest disclosure for Diamondback Energy (FANG): ""We have bigger diversified companies, some service companies and smaller U.S.-focused E&Ps,"" he said. ""Diamondback is a classic one of those. It is an independent E&P with a good spot in the Permian Basin. It has great acreage that it will exploit at attractive costs.""Energy accounted for about 8% of New Insights' assets, its fifth-largest sector by weight, as of July 31. Contra has about 2% in the sector and New Millennium 16%.Technology, with a 26% weighting, is tops. The fund's top-three holdings are Facebook (FB), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN).The fund has been trimming Facebook, but only to take profits and prevent the stake from getting too big. It was about 5% as of July 31. ""It's still our largest relative bet. It is our most important stock,"" said Roth.One leg of Facebook's appeal has been its success in shifting from a web focus to a mobile one. Another has been its success at remaining relevant to users through platforms like WhatsApp and Instagram. A third has been its ability to show advertisers the link between an ad and a sale. ""That's the ability to optimize ad campaigns and (let advertisers) see the return on investment,"" he said.Google is a similar story, Roth adds.Amazon's retail and music businesses do well, Roth says. But Amazon's key improvement is its AWS web services business. It wasn't until mid-2015 that Amazon broke out AWS' financial results. ""Investors were surprised by how profitable the business is,"" Roth said. ""It is a complete game-changer.""AWS has proved more attractive than rival services from Google, IBM (IBM) and Microsoft (MSFT), he adds.The cloud-services platform lets customers rent all the capacity they need at peak times, even if most of the time they need far less. Thus they avoid hefty capital expenditures.In summarizing their teamwork, Roth says that Danoff uses more small starting positions in individual stocks. Roth makes bigger initial buys. ""Our process keeps evolving,"" Roth said. ""I'm excited about it.""RELATED:Diamondback Dominates Shale-Rich Permian Basin With Conservative DealsHow Fidelity Contrafund Manager Will Danoff Played The DownturnP-s-s-st!

30,AIG,"At this summer's DR1 Invitational race at Los Angeles' Sepulveda Dam, a vast, sun-baked plane of concrete, drones the size of overgrown insects carved wide cursive loops through the dam's broad archways. They threaded through slalom posts and shipping containers, punctuated by saw-toothed bursts from their rotors, and sailed to the finish line past a handful of quiet spectators and a few white tents containing tables scattered with toolboxes, extra drones and extra parts.The drones themselves can hit speeds of 80 miles per hour. And they crash a lot -- propellers snap off, frames get bent, the GoPro (GPRO) cameras often mounted to drones to capture video get smashed. That also means the pilots can gauge more quickly what propellers, batteries, frames and controllers work and which don't.""You'll find the technology in the drones that we're racing is newer than most of what is used in commercial applications, or in even military applications, because our development time is so rapid,"" said Chris Thomas, founder of the racing league MultiGP, which helped organize the race. ""We're creating this massive furnace for innovation.""The sport has grown big enough that Disney's (DIS) ESPN will air races and started with an introductory program Thursday. Meanwhile, Amazon's (AMZN) drone delivery plans and Facebook's (FB) intentions to use drones to strengthen internet access are helping to push the aircraft into the mainstream. But flying under the radar is a loosely-knit community of tinkerers creating a groundswell of activity that some have compared with the early years of the PC revolution embodied by Apple (AAPL) a generation ago.And as these drone wildcatters stumble upon ways to improve the aerial devices -- and forge a regulatory framework -- an array of companies is also circling to tap into the entrepreneurial energy.""The drone industry is probably one of the first open-source hardware industries,"" said James Peverill, CEO of GreenSight Agronomics, a Boston-based startup that uses drones for agricultural imaging and analytics and which has done work with golf courses and agrochemical giant Syngenta (SYT).""It almost harkens back to the beginnings of the personal computer industry,"" he added. ""In the late 70s, people were experimenting with computers in the basement, and when Apple Computer was founded, they basically used a lot of the ideas and technology from that DIY community that had hatched.""While few public companies are pure-play drone stocks, the financial industry has been offering broader exposure to the market. PureFunds describes its Drone Economy Strategy ETF (IFLY), which debuted in March, as the first exchange traded fund devoted to tracking the commercial drone market.The fund's holdings include Boeing (BA), Lockheed Martin (LMT) and other defense contractors, drone-maker AeroVironment (AVAV), GoPro and its chipmaker Ambarella (AMBA).""We've seen drones start to transcend the initial aerospace and defense uses into many different industries and sectors around the world,"" PureFunds CEO Andrew Chanin told IBD. ""Trying to play the drone industry -- or any early-stage industry -- by picking one or two companies can be a pretty difficult and volatile proposition.""Amazon has been approved to test delivery drones in the U.K, and Alphabet (GOOGL) this summer got the OK for limited delivery-drone testing in the U.S. But despite the entrance of several tech Goliaths, the drone space is still so wide open that upstarts can aim high.Back when Amazon's drone plans were in a younger stage, Skycart, a drone delivery startup in San Jose, Calif., that started roughly four years ago, was trying to sell companies on the idea of using drones to send things.""Those companies thought we were joking,"" said Lukas Wrede, the company's CEO.Then, Amazon published a video demonstrating Prime Air, its future drone delivery service, and Wrede initially thought Skycart was done for. But he rethought.""If such a big company gets a lot of attention and they also have a powerful lobby, then they could probably influence the market in our interest,"" he said. ""And that's what they did.""Skycart also continued to improve its drone technology, enhancing its autonomous-flight and drop-off capabilities and its abilities to carry packages weighing 10 pounds, up from an earlier target of 5. Today, Skycart has started several delivery projects with their customers, which Wrede characterized as Amazon rivals who have become more aware of the possibilities of drone delivery. Among them is one of the biggest shipping express companies in the U.S., but he declined to identify it.Meanwhile, at the University of Southern California, assistant professor John Carlsson has been developing a delivery model in which drones carrying packages bounce between a moving delivery truck and their destination -- potentially cutting time, traffic and fuel costs.His means of testing this particular model? A drone and a skateboard. Still, he said, he has been approached by a handful of companies, including a multibillion-dollar retailer that sells a variety of products, but which he said is ""not Amazon.""He said he will be ""working on a project with them that will involve drones"" in the next several months that will either incorporate the delivery model or his other drone-related research, which has been backed by U.S. defense funding.""The kind of thing that we work on specifically is really applicable to any situation where you have one large vehicle, and a collection of smaller vehicles that are somehow tied to that,"" he said.As more drones swarm the skies and raise the risk of midair collisions, regulations have struggled to catch up, forcing the community of drone racers and other enthusiasts to cobble together solutions -- similar to the way they improvise technologies for their drones.The Sepulveda Dam race was two years in the making, said Brad Foxhoven, CEO Blockade Entertainment, one of the DR1 race's organizers. Thomas, of MultiGP, said that conversations had to happen between the site's owner and with the FAA, and a film permit had to be obtained.""Nothing like that has ever been permitted before,"" he said. ""We essentially had to look toward the jungle, take out our machetes and cut a path. We're building a sport from scratch.""Permitting, in general, though, is ""like they're trying to put a round peg into a square hole,"" Thomas said.The FAA and Transportation Department in June finalized regulations for small drone use, and the rules took hold last month. Still, some state and local officials are seeing a drone up close for the first time and regulators face information gaps. For example, the 2012 FAA Modernization and Reform Act requires drone operators within five miles of an airport to notify that airport of their presence, but the lines of communication weren't always clear. So companies saw an opening.""People were knocking on the door of the airport manager or calling on the phone and saying 'Hey I'm going to fly my drone at the 7-Eleven,' "" said Ben Marcus, CEO and co-founder of Santa-Monica-based tech company AirMap. ""Airport managers were like: 'What am I supposed to do with that?' ""AirMap's technology offers up a smartphone-accessible map of what's happening in the low-altitude airspace. Their technology lets airports know what drones are in the skies nearby, and provides a communications platform between pilots, airports and others. If you're flying a drone and, say, a jet approaches, AirMap will send an alert. The technology can also provide information on temporary flight restrictions -- wildfires, a sporting event, presidential visits, Marcus said.More than 100 airports use AirMap's technology, including Los Angeles International Airport, Houston's George Bush Intercontinental and other U.S. hubs, said co-founder Gregory McNeal.""Ultimately, when Amazon and Google and other companies are looking to make deliveries, they're going to need to know about all of these types of pieces of low-altitude airspace information, some of which is dynamic,"" McNeal said. ""So the county fair comes to town, and the Ferris wheel goes up. The Amazon drone should know about that before it ever gets to the county fair.""Back at the DR1 race, the Sepulveda Dam was decorated with logos for Pepsico's (PEP) Mountain Dew and Doritos as well as Buffalo Wild Wings (BWLD). The event was broadcast on Twitch, the gaming-centric streaming service Amazon bought in 2014. And in August, the 2016 National Drone Racing Championships took place in New York, an event broadcast via ESPN.And in separate announcements Wednesday, ESPN and U.K. media giant Sky struck deals with the Drone Racing League, another racing group, to broadcast five races over 10 episodes. An introductory broadcast is set to air Thursday on ESPN2, with the others to be broadcast there, ESPN and Sky Sports Mix in October. Sky, which is 39% owned by 21st Century Fox (FOXA), also invested $1 million in the league.Blockade Entertainment's Foxhoven, meanwhile, said his company has had ""multiple conversations"" with people in the e-sports industry, some of whom attended the DR1 Invitational.As the racing community gains more mass appeal, the innovations it has made are starting to trickle out. The Drone Racing League has had ""quite a few outside parties"" approach them about potentially licensing its radio-system technology for non-drone-racing uses, founder and CEO Nicholas Horbaczewski said.""It's been fun to discover that in the process of developing this for a particular purpose, in this case sports, we've developed technology that has a broader application that can be used in other capacities in a positive and productive way,"" he said in an interview.Peverill, of GreenSight Agronomics, said his company uses a flight controller sometimes used in racing. And some companies are also scoping out racing events to see how drones can help their own products.Staff from GoPro, the event's title sponsor, attended the National Drone Racing Championships partly to get more of a sense of how drones could be used to provide more immersive, closer-to-actually-being-there camera work, said Scot Refsland, chairman of the Drone Sports Association, which organized the event.Enterprise data-storage giant EMC (EMC), which also backed the event, ran live demos of virtual reality technology there. AIG (AIG), a partner in the event and an issuer of drone insurance, has been working with the DSA to generate ideas on how to improve insurance for aerial devices as low-altitude airspace grows more crowded and complicated, Refsland said.Elsewhere, Justin Haggerty, founder of the competing International Drone Racing Association, said his organization has attracted interest from telecommunications companies looking to learn more about their technology. Among them was Korean telecom giant KT Corp. (KT), which Haggerty said is looking at ways to use drones for broadcasting.Meanwhile, the educational nonprofit Drones Pilot Federation sees drone racing as a crossover into education. Henry Minden, a vice president in the group, said the aerial devices have the potential to teach younger people, ages 12 to 30, about computer programming, virtual reality, artificial intelligence and assembly, and create new jobs in those areas.""You want to know how to go faster than the rest,"" he said. ""So you find yourself immersed in this world of physics, aerodynamics, electrical engineering and computer science.""In the process, many people involved in the informal community of drone enthusiasts have become advocates for wider application of the devices, which are still best known for their years of use in the military.""If I could just share this with more people, and especially take away the negative connotations,"" said Tommy Tibajia, one of the pilots at the DR1 race. ""Because, whenever I'm flying, (people) are like, 'Stop spying on me!' I'm like, 'Lady, trust me. I'm not spying on you.'

Real Estate Select Sector SPDR (XLRE) was down the most, by 2.8%.Comments from Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren, traditionally seen as a dovish policymaker, fueled negative sentiment. He didn't really say anything earth-shattering, other than to say he backs gradual interest-rate hikes. The Fed has three meetings left this year: Sept. 20-21, Nov. 1-2 and Dec. 13-14.

32,AIG,"Mortgage insurance, an industry that drove several companies to collapse or the brink of failure in the housing crisis, is again considered a safe bet as Arch Capital Group (ACGL) CEO Dinos Iordanou reshapes his company by purchasing a loan guarantor from American International Group (AIG).""Hopefully the last war was fought and lost, and the new war is going to be fought and won,"" Iordanou said Aug. 16 on a conference call, a day after agreeing to pay $3.4 billion to buy AIG's United Guaranty. ""People are going to pay attention to properly price their business.""Mortgage guarantors cover losses for lenders when homeowners default and foreclosure fails to recoup costs. When housing prices are climbing, it can be one of the highest-margin businesses in all of insurance. The thirst for quick profits, however, drove companies to compete too aggressively for business in years such as 2006 and 2007, taking on risks they couldn't handle.""Too many people put their hands on the stove, and they got burned,"" Iordanou said, acknowledging that the past was not always ""stellar"" for the industry. ""I will assure you we're not going to make those tragic mistakes of the past.""Iordanou, along with hedge-fund billionaires and Wall Street giants, were among the first to bet on mortgage-insurance recovery after the credit crisis. The newcomers determined that profits would be sustainable if companies charged more for coverage.Essent Group (ESST), which was built with backing by Goldman Sachs Group (GS) and George Soros' Valorina, acquired assets from money-losing mortgage guarantor Triad Guaranty as markets recovered and had an initial public offering in 2013. That same year, Arch pushed into mortgage insurance with a deal to add assets from PMI Group, which was also hobbled by higher-than-expected claims costs.John Paulson has gained from the recovery of Radian Group (RDN), which is still trading for a fraction of its 2006 closing price. And, more recently, reinsurers tied to hedge fund managers Daniel Loeb and David Einhorn have taken on mortgage-related risks after being stung by losses on property-and-casualty coverage, including policies tied to Florida homes or commercial vehicles.""At this time in the cycle, we like the mortgage sector because we believe that the mortgage insurance earnings are more stable and predictable than P&C earnings,"" said Iordanou, whose Bermuda-based company will become the industry leader with the AIG deal. He expects mortgage insurance to contribute half the company's profits, while consuming only a third of its capital.Even as he sold United Guaranty, AIG CEO Peter Hancock stressed in a memo that his company ""will continue to be a participant in the residential real estate market"" through direct ownership of mortgage loans, a portfolio of structured securities, the holding of Arch stock and continued ties to United Guaranty. In his note to employees he also called the deal a ""milestone.""""This transaction maximizes UGC's value while further streamlining our organization,"" Hancock said in the statement. ""The deal also maintains our affiliation with the mortgage-insurance market and its leading company.""And New York-based AIG, which is divesting assets to free up cash for share buybacks, will also retain a portion of the profits from some United Guaranty policies sold in prior years. Plus, Arch is paying for the deal partly in stock.Holding Arch Capital shares has been a winning bet for two decades. This past week, the stock advanced its gain since Dec. 31 to 15%. The company has climbed in nine of the past 11 years, and never posted an annual decline of worse than 1% in that span.United Guaranty was founded in 1963 and sold to AIG in 1981. The unit has rebounded from the housing crash, when AIG was required to tap a Treasury Department line within its rescue package to help restructure the operation.Related:States Where Making The Mortgage Takes The Least And The Most Work2 Mortgage REITs With Double-Digit Dividend YieldsFor Mortgage Loans, Only Those With The Best Credit Need Apply

33,AIG,"A mild rebound in oil prices did little to stir stocks Wednesday, as indexes opened narrowly lower.The Dow industrials, S&P 500 and Nasdaq dipped 0.1% at the open.U.S. private employers added 179,000 new workers in July, according to ADP's National Employment Report. That was up from 172,000 new hires in June, easily outpacing consensus projections for a dip to 165,000 hirings. The net gain included 185,000 service-sector positions added, while goods-producing firms reduced payrolls by 6,000 jobs.Researcher Markit delivers its July services Purchasing Managers' Index at 9:45 a.m. ET, while at 10 a.m. ET, the Institute for Supply Management reports its July services index. The Energy Information Administration reports weekly oil inventories at 10:30 a.m.Quarterly reports were the key driver ahead of of Wednesday's open, although the real earnings fireworks were set to start in after-hours trade, with Tesla Motors (TSLA), Continental Resources (CLR) and Ebix (EBIX) among companies planning to report.Drug maker Zoetis (ZTS) jumped 2% at the open following a strong second-quarter report. Zoetis ended Tuesday above a 48.78 buy point following a double-bottom base.Time Warner (TWX) shares tuned in a nearly 3% gain after reporting mixed second-quarter results. The company also said it agreed to buy a 10% stake in streaming TV show provider Hulu, although terms were not disclosed. Time Warner shares have climbed since February, working their way out of a year-long consolidation.Fitbit (FIT) pulled up 7% after reporting late Tuesday that its second-quarter sales and earnings easily topped analyst targets, although gross margins came in just below forecasts.Insurance industry flagship American International Group (AIG) muscled up 3.5% at the open. The New York-based company reported stronger-than-forecast second quarter results, and raised its share buyback program by $3 billion.Chipmaker Qorvo (QRVO) tumbled 8% at the open. The Greensboro, N.C.-based company reported fiscal first-quarter revenue and earnings that beat expectations, as it raised its second-quarter revenue guidance above consensus views.Some foreign automakers were in motion, with Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) up nearly 6%, and India's Tata Motors (TTM) down 3% at the starting bell.Oil futures inched higher, with West Texas Intermediate crude up almost 1%, but still below $40 a barrel. WTI is down about 5% so far this week, as the U.S. benchmark tracks toward its sixth loss in the past eight weeks. Brent crude edged up to just above $42. Gold slipped fractionally to trade below $1,369 an ounce. The dollar staged a broad rebound, and bonds also bounced, sending the 10-year Treasury yield down 2 basis points to 1.54%.Overseas, China's markets were mixed: the Shanghai composite rose 0.2%, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index fell 1.8% as it reopened after a one-day storm shutdown. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 stumbled 1.5%, pressured by the rising yen.Europe's markets came under moderate selling pressure in early afternoon trade.

34,AIG,"As crowdfunding becomes accessible to a wider range of investors and companies seeking capital, insurance giant American International Group (AIG) on Tuesday said it will begin offering insurance to protect equity crowdfunding investors from fraud.Unlike crowdfunding through donation sites, equity crowdfunding allows an investor to actually own a company's shares.AIG's decision follows the opening up of startups to mom-and-pop investors. Under new rules from the Securities and Exchange Commission that went into effect earlier this month, anyone can buy a stake in a privately held company through crowdfunding. Previously, only wealthy investors could.The company said its fraud insurance, called Crowdfunding Fidelity, is available to U.K. and Canada equity crowdfunding platforms, and it ""protects individual investors against the theft of issuer assets by issuer directors, officers or general employees which cause a direct loss to the individual investor.""AIG said the insurance plan could be adapted to equity crowdfunding platforms elsewhere, as other nations ""finalize regulations for companies to raise capital.""“As a sector still in its infancy, equity crowdfunding platforms are only as strong as the confidence they instill in their investors,” Lex Baugh, AIG’s president of liability and financial lines, said in a statement.While the insurance company said that crowdfunding-related fraud has been rare, Crowdfunding Fidelity would ""build investor trust in this emerging sector.""Eureeca, a Dubai-based equity crowdfunding platform registered in the U.K., was the first to buy the AIG insurance and offer it to investors, AIG said.“The new power of the crowd and the desire to democratize investing throughout the world can unleash great partnerships,"" Eureeca Co-CEO Chris Thomas said in the statement.AIG shares closed up 1.4% in the stock market today.

As he points out in his newly published posthumous memoir, “Good for the Money: My Fight to Pay Back America,” he said:“I think they would all agree that I’m going to (tick) a lot of people off, and most people don’t have the stomach for that. But if you can deal with a lot of noses out of joint, I’m going to get he job done.”Benmosche (1944-2015) got that job, went on to lead Metropolitan Life Insurance (MET) and, after taking early retirement, was brought back to oversee the effort to save AIG (AIG) and repay the government the more than $182 billion in bailout money -- with a profit.It was a long way from the late Benmosche’s humble beginnings. His family ran a restaurant and rented cabins to summer vacationers in upstate New York. His father died unexpectedly when Bob was just 10 in the midst of a planned expansion/upgrade, leaving the family in debt. His mother had to take on the business and, in the process, taught him valuable lessons that stayed with him throughout his career.Bob was working the front desk when a couple pulled up to check room availability. He responded positively and left it at that. The next day his mother told him that was the wrong answer.  He should have handed them the pen and registration card and asked if they wanted a room with one bed or two. Never mention the rate until asked. At that point, if customers think it’s too high, what are they going to do? They already have the pen in their hand.It was an epiphany for Benmosche, who wrote: “It was like a light bulb were being switched on. I had to help them help me make the sale.”Mom imparted another piece of wisdom when he complained about a boring job stocking shelves in a local supermarket.“You got a better job?” she asked. “No? Then do it.”Benmosche graduated from Alfred University in Alfred, N.Y., with a degree in mathematics, something of a surprise since early on there he had earned an ""F-"" in calculus. “I didn’t know grades ran that low,” he wrote.After graduating in 1966 and serving in the military in Korea, Benmosche took a series of increasingly responsible jobs with Information Systems, a computer company; management consulting firm Arthur D. Little; and the technology group at Chase Manhattan Bank.Along the way, he established the no-nonsense, take-no-prisoners attitude that ultimately would stand him in good stead at AIG. For example, he refused to take meal-meetings -- he wanted to eat quickly and get back to his desk. Besides, he claimed, his office door was always open.He also refused to succumb to office pressure to stay late just because his boss did. He was determined to go home and have dinner with his wife Denise and two children. “If that’s how you’re going to measure my performance (by how late I stay), I’m going to fail big time.”In 1981, a former colleague, Tom Bianco, suggested he meet with Don Nickelson, president of the consumer markets division of what was then Paine, Webber, Jackson & Curtis. Benmosche replied that he didn’t know anything about the financial services company or its business.In turn, Bianco reminded him of advice that Bob had given him years earlier: “Before you make a judgement on an opportunity, you should understand it first.”Recognizing the wisdom of his own words, Benmosche met with Nickelson, who was intrigued by “the noses out of joint” reply to his question and hired him. It was the start of a 14-year career there, ending as executive vice president and director of operations, successfully overseeing the company’s merger with Kidder, Peabody & Co. in 1994.The following year he joined Metropolitan Life, a troubled company operating 50 or more years in the past. Employees were offered unlimited sick days, free lunches and nap time. Through attrition, its sales force had fallen from 12,500 to 7,500 in just four years. But these problems were part of the attraction for Benmosche.“When there’s a trouble spot in an organization, people often avoid it, hoping someone else will step up,” he wrote. “I have always seen my biggest opportunities in these moments.”He began to address the problem by empowering his people. He created a leadership seminar that he personally delivered, spreading “the message that within any organization, leadership is indeed a shared responsibility"" -- something he would repeat later at AIG.Ari Benmosche, Bob’s son and a close confidant, told IBD how it worked: “If you give people the freedom to act, you’ll be amazed at what they can achieve. Now that they have a leader who believes in them, sales started going up, and morale came back.”Benmosche was named CEO in 1998. At the time, MetLife was a mutual company -- that is, one owned by its policy holders -- and in 2000 Benmosche led the transition to making it a public corporation.In January 2005, he announced the acquisition of Travelers Life and Annuity from Citigroup (C) for $11.4 billion, making MetLife the biggest provider of life insurance in North America. It was the capstone of his time as CEO, a period during which the company grew from $11.5 billion to $40 billion.Shortly thereafter, he announced his retirement, effective in the spring of 2006. And why not? He had a great retirement package, he’d bought property in Croatia where he was building a vineyard, and he was looking forward to a carefree retirement. But the best laid plans...In 2009, he was approached about becoming the fifth AIG CEO in four years. Content with his life, he didn’t want to take the job. Ultimately, however, the challenge proved irresistible. If he could turn the company around, he felt, it would prove American resilience. But he didn’t know what he was in for.Because of its involvement in the subprime mortgage fiasco, everyone was taking potshots at the company: stockholders who’d seen their investments in the company evaporate; members of Congress and public officials who were prepared to make AIG a scapegoat; and the public at large, which was being asked to rescue the company.Internally, Benmosche found a deeply troubled company. Morale was low, and many valuable executives had left or were about to.According to Peter Marks, the journalist who co-wrote “Good for the Money” with Benmosche and interviewed many of the principals involved as part of his research, to help rebuild morale, the new boss insinuated himself between critics and the company.“An element of rallying employees was blunting the criticism from Congress and other public officials from reaching employees. He became kind of a backstop for them. Then he went public with his anger towards the government and how it was treating AIG,” Marks said.He railed against public officials who he claimed were grandstanding and wouldn’t back off and allow him and others to do their jobs. And he not only told employees he had their backs, he showed them.One of the major points of contention concerned the bonuses owed executives. Benmosche felt that these payments were part of the employees’ compensation packages and needed to be paid. After much negotiation, Benmosche worked out a deal that secured a large percentage of payment (some of it in company stock) and clawbacks -- that is, the execs returned about 20% of the money to the federal government.But improving morale, dealing with angry politicians and winning back payments for executives were the least of his problems. As Benmosche became more firmly involved in the company, he discovered a vipers' nest, occupied by elements within the company who wanted to undermine the course he had charted for the firm.When he took over, there was a liquidation plan called Project Destiny in place. But he had no intention of following it. “I am not a liquidator,” he wrote. “I don’t liquidate things. I build them.”Throughout his career, he said, a guiding principle was: “If it ain’t broke, break it and make it better.” AIG was a big company with a lot of good elements. He felt that he could help the company repay its debt, and he was determined not to sell assets at fire-sale prices.It was a process that had already begun. AIG's headquarters building in New York’s financial district was sold for $150 million -- only to be resold two years later for $205 million.Bob “wanted to hold off until the markets were more favorable,” co-author Marks said. “He had a genius for understanding value which would bring the assets closer to their true worth.”There was resistance within the company, where some held the belief that getting rid of assets as quickly as possible was the only way out of the mess the company found itself in.Eventually, Benmosche was forced to go to the board. Confident that he was right, he essentially said: my way or the highway. By now a majority of the board came to believe Benmosche was correct and voted to support him.In the end, not only was the federal government repaid in full, but it made a $22.7 billion profit. Brought AIG back to life from the brink of bankruptcy.Overcame: Resistance from elements within the company who wanted to sell everything quickly.Lesson: If you believe you’re right, stick to your guns.“My experience at MetLife had given me a lot of confidence in my abilities as a maximizer of corporate value.” Related:Billionaire Eli Broad Brings 'Why Not?'

37,AIG,"Eli Broad wasn’t eager to talk about his business success in a recent interview. The billionaire entrepreneur is the only person to have built two Fortune 500 companies in different industries, homebuilder KB Home (KBH) and financial services giant SunAmerica (now part of American International Group (AIG)). Been there, done that.What excites him now, he told IBD from the Los Angeles headquarters of The Broad Foundations, is philanthropy that can transform society. He and his wife, Edye, have been funding the arts, improving public schools and investing in the frontiers of biomedicine. With a net worth of $7.4 billion, according to Forbes, they have signed the Giving Pledge to donate most of it.But at the end of the conversation, he decided to share some career lessons.“To be really successful you need to do a lot of reading,” Broad, 82, said, having slowly overcome childhood dyslexia by studying hard. “I read four newspapers every day to understand what is happening in the world and to find new ideas. Second, you have to have a strong work ethic, not the attitude that everything can be done 9-to-5. Finally, don’t just makes goals 10 or 20 years out, but one, two and three years, and when you achieve them, then set higher goals for the next few years.”Broad (rhymes with “road”) grew up in the Bronx, N.Y. His father was a house painter and his mother was a dressmaker. They moved to Detroit when he was 7, where his dad became a community organizer and eventually owned a five-and-dime store.“My parents were Lithuanian Jewish immigrants who needed extra money and had never run a store, but they decided to open, of all things, a Christmas store, renting an empty storefront for two months,” Broad wrote in “The Art of Being Unreasonable.” “Asking ‘why not?’ worked for my parents and I see it as the first step to success.”Tutored by an uncle from age 5 in collecting stamps, he read collector magazines, bought sheets of new sets on the first day and haggled with sidewalk stamp dealers.“I decided I wanted to experience the rush as a seller, so at 13 I bought a box of stamps that had been clipped off envelopes from around the world, which Chrysler was selling,” he wrote. “That was the moment when I had to ask myself, ‘why not?’ I paid $2 for a box and sold the stamps for $12, the first taste of the excitement I came to love in the business world.”He threw himself into after-school jobs in high school, so his grades fell. In 1951, he decided to major in pre-law at what is now Michigan State University. An economics professor got him interested in accounting and he switched majors. Among his jobs in college were selling garbage disposals door-to-door and working as a drill press operator. He graduated with honors in 1954 and married Edythe “Edye” Lawson the same year.Broad, 21, became the youngest person in Michigan history to become a CPA, a record held until 2010. He worked as an accountant for two years, but lost the $67.40-a-week job in 1956 during a recession. He had a few private clients and was teaching accounting at night when Donald Kaufman, the husband of his wife’s cousin, offered to give him office space in return for doing the books of Kaufman’s real estate firm.Broad’s “why not?” led to a homebuilding partnership, Kaufman and Broad Home Corp. in 1957, with Broad putting up his half of the capital by borrowing $12,500 from Edye’s parents.“The first bit of conventional wisdom we encountered was the firm belief that no one in Detroit would buy a house without a basement,” Broad wrote. “From reading industry magazines, I knew that homebuilders in other states were building homes without basements and families were buying them. New gas heating eliminated the need to stockpile coal in basements and if we skipped building them, we could put up homes faster and sell them for less than our competitors.”Their first ones sold for $13,740, $2,000 less than others, and they sold 120 in their first year, generating $1.7 million in revenue. They violated conventional wisdom by only buying land when they needed it, concentrating on building no-frills houses and financing them with mortgage payments that came to less than monthly rent.In 1960, fearing that Detroit was too dependent on the auto industry, they moved the company to Phoenix. KBHC became the first homebuilder to go public. In 1963, Kaufman retired and Broad moved the firm to Los Angeles. There, he popularized town houses -- less expensive because of shared walls. In his last year at the helm in 1989, the firm had $3.8 billion in revenues.To diversify KBHC, in 1971 it had acquired family-owned Sun Life Insurance Co. of America for $52 million.“I began reading industry annual reports and trade publications to learn all about the market and realized that corporations were offering fewer pension plans and baby boomers were aging and living longer,” he said. “There was a rising demand for retirement savings, so we decided to move out of insurance and into annuities, mutual funds and financial planning.”In 1989, SunAmerica was spun off and in 1999, it earned net income of $516 million, with assets of $39 billion. That’s when Broad merged it with AIG for $18 billion, pocketing $3 billion. He stayed on until 2001 as CEO before he left to focus on philanthropy full-time.The Broads have so far invested $4 billion focused on where they feel they can make the most long-term difference. “We can take risks that other institutions and governments don’t typically take and can work with other leaders to achieve ambitious goals,” he said.The Broads have supported numerous art and architecture projects around the U.S. He was the founding chairman of the Museum of Contemporary Art in downtown Los Angeles in 1979. In 2008, the Broad Foundations gave a $30 million challenge grant to keep it from bankruptcy. The Broads gave the Los Angeles County Museum of Art $60 million as part of a renovation campaign.Last September, the Broads opened The Broad (that’s the full name of the museum) downtown to display works from their personal and foundation collections (which is available for loans to other museums worldwide). Next door is the Walt Disney Concert Hall, which was constructed after Broad raised $225 million.“The arts and architecture are important to society because they stimulate creativity,” he said. “Thinking that gets outside the normal day-to-day life allows a broader view of what is happening in the world.”The Eli and Edythe Broad Foundation is the organization which funds investments in education and scientific research. It has given $144 million to support charter schools across the U.S., “creating innovative governance models that give families high-quality public school options and empower teachers and school leaders to do what’s best for their students,” according to the foundation 2015-16 annual report.  It has also funded programs that have trained hundreds of education professionals and found ways to keep high-risk students from dropping out.“It has been 32 years since the report ‘A Nation at Risk’ documented the failure of our schools, and little has changed since then,” said Broad. “We’re now behind 20 other industrialized countries by most measurements. Entrenched bureaucracies, policies and practices are no longer helping teachers and students to make progress.”The foundation has also provided more than $800 million for scientific and medical research, most notably to advance biomedical science and genomic medicine by creating and endowing the Broad Institute in Cambridge, Mass.“We’ve helped scientists at UCLA, UC San Francisco and USC collaborate in stem cell research,” said Broad. “They’ve made great strides and we expect the next 10 years will be a golden era for researchers. The Broad Institute in partnership with M.I.T. and Harvard are working together in the world’s most advanced genomics project, involving over 2,000 people with an annual budget of $380 million.”The same traits and habits that helped Broad succeed in business have enabled him to push beyond conventional wisdom in philanthropy.“Demand the unreasonable of yourself and you will exceed everyone’s expectations, not least your own,” he said.Billionaire built two Fortune 500 companies.Overcame: Resistance to his “unreasonable” goals.Lesson: Set short-term targets to reach big goals.“A crisis is an opportunity to rethink everything.”Related:Stephen Girard Built Massive Wealth Via Bold TradingJames Cox, From Presidential Loss To Media Empire

39,AIG,"The Treasury Department is challenging a district court ruling that MetLife (MET) was no longer ""too big to fail"" and could make it more difficult for General Electric (GE) and AIG (AIG) to get their labels removed.Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew said in a statement that he strongly disagrees with the ruling that would give MetLife ""even less oversight than before the financial crisis,"" and the Treasury released a statement saying that ""the government will appeal the district court’s decision.”In her ruling, District of Columbia federal judge Rosemary Collyer said that the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) ""ignored"" or ""abandoned"" its responsibilities when it designated the insurer as a systemically important financial institution.Collyer's ruling was issued last week, but her reasoning was sealed until late Tuesday.MetLife shares closed down less than 0.1% in the stock market today.The government's appeal could put the breaks on GE and other companies' potential requests to have the designation removed.Last week, GE asked the FSOC  to end GE Capital’s “too big to fail”  designation after the MetLife ruling, saying it has cut risks by reducing assets and exiting U.S. consumer and leveraged lending.AIG's CEO Peter Hancock told CNBC last week that the MetLife ruling is an opportunity for AIG to also apply to get its label removed. Prudential Financial (PRU) has similarly said it might try to get its label removed.GE shares rose 0.5%.

40,AIG,"You don’t have to be a full-time entrepreneur to be entrepreneurial. Instead, you can invest, advise and dive into ventures without leaving your day job.That’s from Patrick McGinnis, author of “The 10% Entrepreneur: Live Your Startup Dream Without Quitting Your Day Job.”McGinnis says the advantage is that you protect yourself from a career blowup. He found himself in exactly that spot after the 2008 financial crisis, as he worked at a private equity firm within AIG (AIG).Also, you can learn to think like an entrepreneur while having the benefit of regular income.McGinnis went on to found Dirigo Advisors, which provides strategic business advice.Tips on utilizing all your resources in business:Stick to the numbers. McGinnis says a 10% entrepreneur invests 10% of his time and 10% of his money into new ventures. He found those numbers were a “meaningful yet achievable long-term commitment.""McGinnis points to the Angel Capital Association as backing that up: “The average angel investor allocates approximately 10% of his or her portfolio toward those types of opportunities.”Think like a boss. You can work for years collecting paycheck after paycheck, but if you’re not an owner, the opportunity to build real wealth is usually limited.“When you engage with new ventures on a part-time basis, you will be the owner of everything you create,"" McGinnis said. ""You may change your career at multiple points in a lifetime, changing functions, changing roles and changing companies, but you’ll always be creating value for the most important employer of all: you.”Play to your strengths. ""Your most successful projects will be the ones that leverage all of the knowledge and relationships you’ve built,” and make you “far more efficient,” McGinnis said.Respect you day job. Being a 10% entrepreneur is neither anti-job nor anti-corporate, McGinnis said. Since your day job is the part of your life that will permit you to work on your own ventures in the first place, “you need to make it a priority.” Never use corporate resources for your own projects. And remember, “the people you work with every day may end up being loyal customers, future partners or early investors.""Reign in wastefulness.

Reduce all scheduled meetings from a default 60 minutes to 30 minutes, Carreau advised. “You will be amazed how much more productive your meetings become,” and those extra 30 minutes will add up to better use.Combine everything. Integrate your life into one calendar, rather than separate professional and personal things. It all has to get done, and in the same day. “DVR your favorite show and watch them on the elliptical at the gym, or plan family time around a favorite sporting event you can watch together,” Carreau suggested.Plan with purpose. Integrate as many tasks as you can into your day instead of going back and forth unnecessarily, Carreau says. Find a gym on the route to the office or to a grocery store on your way home. Along the same lines, set up errands to maximize time and efficiency.Account for yourself.

41,AIG,"General Electric (GE) asked regulators to end GE Capital's ""too big to fail""  designation Thursday, a day after MetLife (MET) won a court battle over its designation.The industrial conglomerate said it believes GE Capital no longer meets the criteria to be designated as a nonbank Systemically Important Financial Institution (SIFI) and asked the Financial Stability Oversight Council FSOC to remove the label.“We have completed over 80% of our projected asset reductions; exited leveraged lending and U.S. consumer lending; exited nearly all middle market lending; reduced real estate debt by more than 75% and real estate equity by 100%; and reduced outstanding commercial paper almost 90%,"" said GE Capital CEO Keith Sherin, in a release.GE shares closed down 0.1% in the stock market today.The announcement comes after a federal judge sided with MetLife to have its ""too big to fail"" designation removed. Metlife shares fell 1.8% after jumping 5% Wednesday.The SIFI label was put on GE Capital in 2013  and requires companies to hold more capital to try and prevent another financial crisis as part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act.GE Capital once generated 42% of General Electric's profit, but the company has shifted focus back to its industrial core.Also Thursday, AIG (AIG) CEO Peter Hancock told CNBC that the MetLife ruling is an opportunity for AIG to also apply to get its label removed. But Hancock said the bailed-out insurer hasn’t decided yet if it will apply.AIG shares fell 0.9%.

42,AIG,"MetLife (MET) beat back a U.S. attempt to label it too big to fail, which would’ve put America’s biggest life insurer under tougher government scrutiny and could have forced it to put more money in reserves.A federal judge in Washington struck down the designation on Wednesday in a decision that could shake up the financial regulatory reform implemented following the 2008 recession. The ruling might give ammunition to Republican lawmakers who’ve argued that regulators have abused their authority under the Dodd-Frank Act.“One of the centerpieces of the Dodd-Frank Act has been called into question,” Isaac Boltansky, an analyst with Compass Point Research & Trading in Washington, said in a phone interview. “Depending on what the court’s reasoning was, I think it’s fair to believe that there could be a more aggressive push to curtail the FSOC’s authority in the next Congress depending on the election outcome in November.”U.S. District Judge Rosemary Collyer rejected the Financial Stability Oversight Council’s rationale for classifying MetLife as a systemically important financial institution. The reasons for the ruling were sealed by the judge, although she did offer a glimpse of her rationale, siding with MetLife that the designation didn’t take into account the economic effect on the insurer.The ruling undercuts the foundation of the Obama administration’s plan to more heavily regulate four nonbank businesses that were determined to have the potential to destabilize the American financial system. MetLife had called the designation arbitrary and unjustified. Chief Executive Officer Steve Kandarian said earlier this year that his New York-based company will shed much of its domestic retail business because SIFI put it at a “significant competitive disadvantage.”MetLife shares were up more than 5% in afternoon trading in the stock market today. Prudential Financial (PRU), which is the second-largest U.S. life insurer and was also named a non-bank SIFI, rallied near 2%.After a rigorous analysis, the FSOC “determined that material financial distress at MetLife could pose a threat to the financial system,” U.S. Treasury spokesman Adam Hodge said in an emailed statement. “We firmly believe that FSOC acted well within its legal authority to protect the entire global economy.”MetLife's lawyers argued that the council failed to assess MetLife’s vulnerabilities to financial distress and that it failed to consider the economic effects of the designation on the company. The judge ruled in MetLife’s favor on those points.Filed last year, the MetLife suit was the biggest challenge yet to the council that includes Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen and Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew.Other nonbanks bearing its SIFI designation are AIG (AIG) and Prudential, neither of which have brought challenges. General Electric (GE) has agreed to sell more than $160 billion of assets since April under a plan to shed the bulk of its GE Capital finance operations. GE has said it intends to submit an application to regulators this quarter to drop the label.In January, Kandarian announced that MetLife plans to pursue a spinoff, sale or public offering of much of its U.S. retail business, which sells variable annuities and life insurance policies and could be subjected to higher capital rules although they’ve not yet been finalized.While the insurer hasn’t outlined a precise plan, it struck a deal in February to sell a distribution network with 4,000 financial advisors to Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance.

43,AIG,"Box (BOX) reported a narrower-than-expected fiscal Q4 loss as revenue growth of 36% topped expectations. It sent the online data storage and file-sharing service provider’s stock up 14% in after-hours trading, just after the market close.The company forecast current-quarter revenue above expectations and a narrower-than-expected full-year fiscal 2017 loss.Aaron Levie, co-founder and CEO of Box, said the company closed 13 deals valued at more than $500,000 each in fiscal Q4.“Enterprise IT is experiencing a once-in-a-lifetime shift to the cloud,"" he said on the company’s earnings call.Box’s new customers include AIG (AIG), Genentech and Home Depot (HD).Redwood City, Calif-based Box said revenue for the three months ended Jan. 30 rose 36% to $85 million as corporate customer additions rose, beating views. Box said it lost 26 cents per share minus items. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had modeled a loss of 29 cents per share and revenue of $81.77 million. Box said its non-GAAP operating loss in Q4 was $31.1 million (37% of revenue) vs $32.2 million (51% of revenue) a year earlier.For the current quarter, Box forecasts revenue of $88.5 million at the midpoint of its range, vs. analysts' consensus estimate of $86.9 million. For the fiscal year ending in January 2017, the company expects revenue of about $392 million and a loss of 84 cents at the midpoints of its ranges. Analysts had estimated that Box will report a full-year fiscal 2017 loss of 88 cents with revenue of $392 million.Box stock had closed up 3.7% in regular-session trading in the stock market today, prior to fiscal Q4 results.Known mainly as an Internet cloud storage provider, Box has evolved from a provider of basic online data storage into selling file sharing and collaborative tools for team projects. It also sells content management software for large companies.The company added 3,000 business customers in the January quarter. It had 57,000 paying business customers as of Jan. 30, up from 54,000 in the October quarter. Box says that its paying customers include 59% of the Fortune 500.Box said fiscal Q4 billings, a sales growth metric, rose 59% to $130 million.Box competes with Microsoft (MSFT), though it’s now a partner for Office 365 products as well. It also counts as rivals Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Google, privately-held Dropbox, Amazon.com (AMZN) and others.Data storage costs have been falling, owing to the availability of remote data centers packed with computer servers, putting pressure on pricing. One of Box’s challenges, analysts say, is driving average selling prices higher with add-on software modules, such as file-sharing tools, as prices for online data storage continue to fall.Box has been aggressive on pricing to grab market share in the enterprise market, analysts say. It has a strong retention rate among customers. The company's capital spending jumped in fiscal 2016 as it invested in server capacity and built a new headquarters, but capex is expected to drop sharply in the current fiscal year.“With data center investments nearing the end, 2016 is likely to see significant improvement in free cash flow,” said Rob Owens, a Pacific Crest Securities analyst, in a research report.The bearish view is that Box will need to keep buying more servers as it adds customers, making it harder to turn profitable.Box has forecast that it will be free-cash-flow positive starting in fiscal Q4 2017 and FCF positive for the full year in fiscal 2018.Under a ""freemium"" business model, Box also provides consumers with free personal data storage accounts. Box had 41 million free users as of Oct. 31.Aside from Microsoft, Box has alliances with IBM (IBM) and Salesforce.com (CRM) in the enterprise market. Box partnered with IBM in June 2015 to develop new applications and jointly market products and services The IBM relationship has enabled Box to target larger business deals, analysts say.At a Morgan Stanley conference last week, Box said it’s developing a new workflow technology with IBM that will use tools from IBM’s “Watson” artificial intelligence program.While competition has been growing in online data storage, Google and Amazon focus mainly on small and medium-size businesses. Box aims to set itself apart by targeting government agencies as well as industries such as health care, retail, and media and entertainment. It acquired MedXT, a provider of cloud-based medical image viewing, in October 2014.Box currently gets a low IBD Composite Rating of 26 out of a possible 99. The company went public in January 2015, with shares priced at 14. The IPO raised $175 million. Box’s stock spiked on its first day of trading and traded above 20 in June but swooned into the end of 2015, and slid more sharply in January. Its stock touched an all-time low of 8.82 on Jan. 20. Shares began an ascent in early February, though short interest also rose significantly.

44,AIG,"American International Group (AIG) announced Tuesday a series of strategic changes that include over $1 billion in cost cuts, the sale of its broker-dealer unit and the spin-off of the insurer's mortgage business following pressure from billionaire Carl Icahn to split into three companies.As part of an effort to create a ""leaner, more profitable and focused insurer,"" the company plans to execute an initial public offering of up to 19.9% of mortgage business United Guaranty Corporation as a first step toward separation, among other actions.It will also sell AIG Advisor Group to Lightyear Capital LLC and PSP Investments as it streamlines the business via divestitures and exits. The broker-dealer unit sale is expected to close in Q2 2016. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.The company also announced targeted expense cuts of $1.6 billion -- or 14% of 2015 gross general operating expenses -- within two years, and it vowed to return ""at least"" $25 billion of capital to shareholders over the next two years through buybacks and dividends.Last October, Icahn had disclosed a ""large stake"" in AIG and called for the insurance giant to split into three separate companies in order to fend off regulatory pressures. Billionaire John Paulson had also urged a split-up.But on Tuesday the company defended its choice not to pursue a full breakup.""After careful consideration, AIG believes that a full breakup in the near term would detract from, not enhance, shareholder value,"" AIG's Non-Executive Chairman Douglas M. Steenland said in a statement. ""A lack of diversification benefits would reduce capital available for distribution, and there would be a loss of tax benefits. Being a non-bank SIFI (systemically important financial institution) is not currently a binding constraint on return of capital.""AIG shares closed up 1% on the stock market today.RELATED:Amid M&As, Alcoa Split Gets Backing, AIG Split UrgedCarl Icahn Buys Big Stake In ‘Too Big To Succeed’ AIG.

49,AIG,"Let October 2015 go down in the annals of time as one of the best performing Octobers in history -  as the indexes proved resilient.  The S&P surged 8.3%, the DOW was up 9.6% and the Nasdaq Composite rallied 9.4%.  But - despite the strong October, stocks showed a lack of direction last week - churning, waiting, and churning.....and on Friday they eventually came under pressure as we moved into the close and many portfolio managers did some window  'undressing'.
"
50,AIG,"The major indexes accelerated to the downside as we moved into the 4 O'clock hour - closing at their worst levels of the day. The Dow slid 92 points (-0.5%), Nasdaq fell 21 points (-0.4%)and the S&P dropped 10 points (-0.5%). The choppy trading seen last week continues to reflect trader/investor confusion about the near-term outlook for the mkt, the outlook for the FED, the outlook for the broader global economy - following one of the strongest October’s in history.
"
51,AIG,"Does all of this great action suggest the worse is behind us?  That the August 'panic' is over?   In the bigger picture  you must consider that October was NOT a game changer.....I mean look - October was nothing more than a reasonable back test of broken support.
"
52,AIG,"A quick look at the S&P over the last 4 yrs reveals a very clear, well formed ascending, narrowing triangle...otherwise known as a 'bearish wedge'  -  Now in August the support (2020) was broken -  and typically that means that a new correction cycle begins.  We saw prices break down quickly taking the mkt to 1875 ish.....only to rally and back test that broken support level - successfully piercing it as the mkt struggled to hold on.
"
53,AIG,"Now there is clearly some central bank influencing going on  but from a purely technical picture,  my sense is that we have not seen the end of the coming correction just yet. True bear markets take time to play out - investors will test and re-test support and then back test broken support as they re-price this asset class based on either improving or worsening global macro data. Many will tell us that the August 'correction' was enough to clear the decks, but do not allow yourself to be lulled into a state of complacency......perpetual liquidity from nearly every central bank can and will support bull mkts  for an extended time...... - so now we must ask - how do we define that time period?  Has the FED, the ECB, the BoJ and the PBoC just pushed that out another 4 or 5 months?  Or will the FED surprise us and raise rates in December and cause more mkt turmoil in the final weeks of the year?   Are investors tiring of all the FED speak?  Do these clowns cause more angst and anxiety because they are so divided sending all kinds of mixed messages to the mkts - in fact causing the very turmoil that they profess to avoid?

I'm just sayin.... Just for the record - the mkts are expecting the NFP report to show +180k jobs on Friday....This after we got just +142k jobs in September.....

55,AIG,"Mark Zandi - Chief Economist at Moody's Analytics says it clearly..... ""Look, if those employment numbers are reasonably solid, that's a green light to raise rates.    As long as we get the next couple of jobs numbers, over 150,000, that will be enough to get them to move in December. That was a pretty clear message in the statement"".
"
56,AIG,"Remember too - that this month the FED deleted any reference to the weakness in China.....which many analysts suggest is their way of 'tipping us off' that the game has changed....that they are now laser focused on US macro data.......in the last week alone - the odds of a FED increase have moved up from 30%  to 50% and this is exactly why the mkt is now churning.....as the uncertainty once again permeates investor psyche.
"
57,AIG,"The whole song and dance about being data dependent is understandable, but then stop changing the tempo of that 'song and dance' with all the noise from the differing FED speakers.    In the end - the noise just caps the upside and causes the mkts to once again become cautious over the indecision.....and as long as the mkts think the FED is unclear then the path of least resistance will be lower.  What the mkt wants is for the FED to be decisive - and then the mkt will take care of the rest....asset prices will either succumb to selling pressure or they won't but the uncertainty is not helping.

58,AIG,"And this morning US futures have been all over the place...in early morning pre-mkt trading they were down 10+ pts on the back of the weak China factory data...that came in at 48.3 - still in contraction territory - causing Asian mkts to come unglued....Japan - 2.1%, Hong Kong - 1.19%, China - 1.7% and ASX -1.4%....

"
63,AIG,"B016: In an otherwise sensible economic debate last week, all the Republican candidates flunked the stress test on bank bailouts. Instead of pledging to end bailouts forever, they said they might do it all over again.This a big problem for the party, because the 2008 taxpayer rescue of the big banks, AIG and investment houses continues to cast a long shadow. Americans still think of the GOP as the party of corporate bailouts.Here's how John Kasich put it: ""When a bank is ready to go under, and depositors are getting ready to lose their life savings, you just don't say, 'We believe in philosophical concerns.' Philosophy doesn't work when you run something.""Ted Cruz then intervened by attacking Kasich for being in favor of bailouts. ""Why would you bail out rich Wall Street banks and not Mom and Pop?"" he asked. ""What would you do if the bank was failing?""Kasich dug the hole deeper when he sanctimoniously replied: ""I would not let the people who put their money in there all go down."" Instead he would ""separate those people who can afford it, versus those people who are the hardworking folks who put their money in those institutions. ... You've got to deal with it. You can't turn a blind eye there.""The audience roundly booed. Lesson: Voters hate bailouts.Cruz then pledged that he wouldn't ever bail out banks. Right answer. But then he retreated and said that he might let the Federal Reserve intervene in its role of lender of last resort to help the banks. That sounds suspiciously like a bailout.Even Jeb Bush whiffed by saying that he would have regulators require banks to hold more capital. This comment came only a short while after he complained about too many federal rules and pledged to abolish Obama regulation.Here's what should have been said: Bailouts were a terrible mistake and were unfair to banks that loaned out their money responsibly. The bailouts only created a ""too big to fail"" doctrine that is hurting community banks. Bailouts are the ultimate form of cronyism, because Uncle Sam doesn't bail out small businesses.And Kasich's argument that bailouts are necessary to protect the lifetime savings of depositors is spurious, because we already have FDIC deposit insurance for families.The candidates should have also condemned Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Let's not forget that they got $150 billion in bailouts — more than any private bank. These government enterprises should be privatized.Republicans should also condemn the practices of Fannie and Freddie, which are still up to their dangerous practice of insuring 3%-down-payment mortgages.Republicans should talk of how the Fed's policies of cheap money inflated the real-estate bubble and alert voters to the danger of a new Fed-induced, zero-interest-rate financial bubble that could burst.Washington intelligentsia are attempting to rewrite history by praising Ben Bernanke for rescuing the nation's finances — when these were the policies that wrecked the economy in the first place.As for Bush's idea of higher capital requirements on banks, such a rule won't stop a 2008-style meltdown. In the run-up to the 2008 banking crisis, the big banks were heavily invested in what the government eggheads proclaimed were ""safe"" mortgage-backed securities. Those toxic investments, not inadequate capital, are what caused the cascade of losses.Democrats are ready to pounce on the GOP as the party that rescues fat-cat friends while abandoning the working class. To win back the trust of millions of voters who haven't forgotten the trauma of 2008, Republicans must swear off bailouts and reestablish their credentials as the party not of corporate welfare but of free enterprise.If they don't, voters will again snuff them out as economic frauds, and Hillary Clinton will prance into the Oval Office.

68,AIG,"Salesforce.com (CRM) is trying to become a $10 billion company as well as tap into a target-rich environment, and it may well have made huge strides toward both with its announcement Tuesday of plans to offer wealth management services software to the cloud.
"
69,AIG,"The big player in cloud customer relationship management software, Salesforce said it will start offering this financial services package — called the Salesforce Financial Services Cloud — as part of its design to go ""vertical"" in a number of fields instead of just offering what it calls a ""horizontal"" product that can be used in a number of industries.
"
70,AIG,"Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff has made no secret of his plans to grow the company by leaps and bounds over the next few years, with a goal of reaching $10 billion in annual revenue, and this is one key avenue the company is using to achieve that through its ""Dreamforce"" initiatives.
"
71,AIG,"""It expands the number of people who could use their software,"" said Samad Samana, analyst for FBR Capital Markets. ""This is what I call the natural evolution of an enterprise software company.""
"
72,AIG,"Salesforce officials say they plan to bring several product offerings to market that home in on specific industries. Health care and the auto industry are just two of the other industries that will be targeted.
"
73,AIG,"Offering software that helps money advisors speak with clients provided the most immediate opportunity, said Simon Mulcahy, senior vice president and general manager of Salesforce's financial services unit. It also was the industry where Salesforce's normal CRM customers were the loudest.
"
74,AIG,"""The feedback was so strong,"" Mulcahy said. ""This is a paradigm that is not there at the moment.""
"
75,AIG,"Financial advisors and clients traditionally have maintained a formal relationship in which the advisor spends a significant amount of time preparing paperwork for a face-to-face appointment with a client. That's the extent of the relationship in many cases, Mulcahy said.
"
76,AIG,"What Salesforce hopes to do is digitize the ties between advisor and client so there can be constant communication between the two, even in informal settings. Advisors would be able to look at a client's portfolio from the back of a cab or in a coffee line and offer advice instantly online.
"
77,AIG,"Mulcahy says Salesforce picked financial services first because the company's existing financial services customers — who advise everyone from high net-worth clients down to the average retail investor — sought ways to deepen relationships with clients.
"
78,AIG,"""We're not moving in and exploring. We're going in with fantastic relationships,"" he said.
"
79,AIG,"To design its new product, Salesforce worked with wealth management firms, including AIG (AIG) Advisor Group, Northern Trust (NTRS) and United Capital.
"
80,AIG,"Mulcahy adds there are few competitors who have tapped this market, though there are some who are offering customized programs for advisors of high-net-worth clients. The company's main competitor in this realm would be banks and brokerages themselves who use their own tech teams to develop their own software.
"
81,AIG,"Potential rivals down the road could be the likes of Luxoft Holding (LXFT), Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTSH) and SS&C Technologies (SSNC), all highly rated by IBD with a Composite Rating of 97 or better out of a possible 99. But Mulcahy says the field is so vast that the companies could end up partnering at some point. Salesforce partnered with other software firms, including Informatica and Yodlee (YDLE), on the initial stages of this venture.
"
82,AIG,"Yuri Elkin, managing director for Luxoft's financial services division, isn't upset about the move. He says that his company targets high-net-worth clients with customized software for individual brokers, while Salesforce looks to bring software to the masses.
"
83,AIG,"""It confirms the trend is out there,"" he said. ""I'm actually glad they did it.""

Advisors would be able to look at a client's portfolio from the back of a cab or in a coffee line and offer advice instantly online.Mulcahy says Salesforce picked financial services first because the company's existing financial services customers — who advise everyone from high net-worth clients down to the average retail investor — sought ways to deepen relationships with clients.""We're not moving in and exploring. We're going in with fantastic relationships,"" he said.To design its new product, Salesforce worked with wealth management firms, including AIG (AIG) Advisor Group, Northern Trust (NTRS) and United Capital.Mulcahy adds there are few competitors who have tapped this market, though there are some who are offering customized programs for advisors of high-net-worth clients. The company's main competitor in this realm would be banks and brokerages themselves who use their own tech teams to develop their own software.Potential rivals down the road could be the likes of Luxoft Holding (LXFT), Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTSH) and SS&C Technologies (SSNC), all highly rated by IBD with a Composite Rating of 97 or better out of a possible 99. But Mulcahy says the field is so vast that the companies could end up partnering at some point. Salesforce partnered with other software firms, including Informatica and Yodlee (YDLE), on the initial stages of this venture.Yuri Elkin, managing director for Luxoft's financial services division, isn't upset about the move. He says that his company targets high-net-worth clients with customized software for individual brokers, while Salesforce looks to bring software to the masses.""It confirms the trend is out there,"" he said. ""I'm actually glad they did it.""Salesforce, which carries a high Composite Rating of 93 from IBD, ended trading essentially flat in the stock market today.

85,AIG,"As long as execution ""speed,"" not execution ""price,"" is the master of our electronic equity markets, no one should lament the mind-bending volatility.As long as computerized algorithms price intraday downdrafts after the opening, TV talking heads will express their dismay.As long as there are very few orders on a centralized book and Dodd-Frank has killed the traditional risk-taking market makers and big trading desks, there will continue to be no counter side liquidity in our markets, and dramatic flash meltdowns will continue causing the public to lose confidence in our markets.And that is the real problem.Throughout history, there have always been reasons for periodic market crashes. And as painful as many have been, the public mostly understood why they happened ... often in response to pending economic problems.Since the full-on conversion to our new electronic markets a decade ago, and the repeal in 2007 of the uptick rule, which required short sellers to wait for an uptick in price to sell short, we have experienced numerous severe downdrafts and subsequent record volatility.The subprime crisis of 2008-09 and the resulting collapse of Bear Sterns, Lehman and AIG pushed our financial institutions and our economy to the brink. Yet that painful and understandable bear market was punctuated by unprecedented intraday volatility in both individual stocks and the market as a whole.Also during this period, market confidence has been pummeled by other severe and often inexplicable market meltdowns, like the ""flash crash"" on May 6, 2010.After each of these events, public dismay with extreme volatility, plus headlines that spread fear and mistrust, shook confidence in our equity markets.Then came this past Monday's gyrations.It's not that markets went down — it's how they went down. Certainly, fears of a China slowdown, devaluation, etc. are real. Yet, Monday's volatility was such a wild ride that even seasoned traders and financial news commentators were left shaking their heads.As just one vivid example, KKR & Co., the asset management firm, traded from a high of $19.43 to a low of $8.00 and closed at $19.50. Yikes!Fingers are being pointed everywhere. High-frequency traders are a high-frequency target. These electronic markets are so complicated and fragmented that it's hard to draw conclusions. Yet I submit that HFTs are a symptom of structural weakness in our overall market, not the singular cause of high volatility.Electronic markets are here to stay and, in their defense, they work quite well most of the time. Unfortunately, more work needs to be done to enable them to handle occasional short-term market liquidity problems and hyper volatility. And these are the events that make headlines and shake confidence.Jim Cramer, emphasizing the importance of investors entering limit orders in today's Wild West markets, lamented on TV Tuesday morning that some poor investors sold GE at $20 during Monday's opening few minutes. The stock had closed Friday at $24.59 and got as low Monday as $19.37 before closing at $23.87.In the ""old days"" of the NYSE, the floor specialist who handles GE would have been dragged up to market surveillance, punished severely, fined and made to write checks for a botched opening of such magnitude.The procedure when opening stocks with large imbalances of buyers and sellers was to slow things down, delay the opening and publish the imbalance. This usually brought in orders on the other side so a more reasonable opening price was achieved.The integrity of the price discovery, not the delay, was the goal. Back then, when the wheels came off, everyone knew who to blame.We're obviously never going back to a human hands-on marketplace. But there should be a way for electronic markets to deal better with these occasional but very visible and damaging short-term imbalances of supply and demand that cause the volatility. There has to be a way to slow things down when the wheels are about to come off.In defense of our regulators, some rules have been updated in an attempt to control electronic volatility. A new rule can slow down openings, circuit breakers have been tweaked and, thankfully, an uptick rule has been reimposed once a stock declines 10%.While these are positive steps, specific attention needs to be focused on these repeating catastrophic periods of volatility. This is complicated stuff, but the stakes are so high that we need to fix this. It can be done.Regulators have restored confidence before. Our first real taste of runaway computerized trading came in the crash of Oct. 19, 1987. On that day, automated program trading and portfolio insurance turned the decline into the largest percentage drop in market history — 22.6%.I remember fellow floor brokers and specialists after the close that memorable day declaring ""the business as we know it is gone forever.""Yet, in the aftermath, the regulators took many bold steps such as the imposition of ""circuit breakers"" that halted or slowed program trading during steep declines.Similarly, after the crash of 1929, the SEC was founded, a short-selling uptick rule enacted and market oversight began.Today's investors need to be reassured that someone is watching their backs during periods of market stress. A good place to start is by adjusting our equity markets to covet price discovery before ""fast and furious"" speed. There will be severe pain among some professional market participants, but Wall Street has a long history of flexibility and innovation. The hare eventually learned the tortoise was not so dumb after all. Porpora was a member of the New York Stock Exchange for 31 years — five as a specialist, 26 as an institutional floor broker.

"
149,AIG,"After some disappointing economic reports over the past week, the stock market welcomed news of jobless claims tumbling to a 14-year low.Bijan Moazami, an analyst at Guggenheim Securities, says the nation's improving unemployment rate, 5.9% as of September's end, is helping to boost profit and lower workers' compensation losses for AmTrust Financial Services (AFSI). As one of the largest U.S. workers' comp insurance providers, it collected about $1.6 billion in related premiums last year.More people working means fewer staying at home collecting workers' comp benefits, Moazami says. That lowers AmTrust's loss ratio, or the percentage of the premium it collects that goes toward paying workers' comp claims.People tend to get back on the job sooner in a strong labor market that ensures they've got work to return to when able, Moazami says, while a poor jobs market can lead to longer claim periods.""You always make more money keeping your job than getting workers' comp benefits,"" he said. ""People going back to work sooner and faster decreases the loss for the insurance company.""Lots Of LinesBesides workers' compensation insurance, AmTrust provides extended-warranty coverage on everything from electronics to cars, specialty middle-market property and casualty insurance and several related products and services, for which fee income has been growing.Thanks in part to rising investment and fee income, coupled with a lower tax rate, AmTrust sports the highest return on equity ratio in its industry. The measure of company net income divided by the money shareholders have invested averages 10% for its peers, according to JMP Securities analysts Matthew Carletti and Christine Worley.""(AmTrust's) return on equity is well in excess of 20%, which is basically unheard of in the insurance business,"" Moazami said.AmTrust shares have defied the stock market's recent swoon. They have outpaced the S&P 500 by a wide swath this year, rallying 37% vs. 2% for benchmark. The company also outperformed all of its peers in IBD's Insurance-Property/Casualty/Title industry group, which is up 3% year-to-date.AmTrust primarily insures a small-business niche concentrated around low-hazard, low-risk industries in which people work in offices, shops and restaurants. It doesn't compete with bigger names like Travelers Cos. (TRV), Liberty and American International Group (AIG), which target large businesses. Its average-size policy covers nine full-time employees at an average premium cost of $9,000.By not insuring against natural disasters, AmTrust avoids the risk of major losses from one-off catastrophes that hangs over its competitors. Its client businesses have a habit of renewing their policies year after year, providing AmTrust a very stable earnings stream. What's more, workers' comp premiums have grown in California, New York and Florida.""And they're growing gangbusters, faster than any other company I follow,"" Moazami added.The company passed a milestone of $1 billion in total revenue for the first time in the second quarter, AmTrust CFO Ron Pipoly noted on a recent conference call.Looking at the past four quarters, earnings have grown between 30% and 79% year-over-year each period, while revenue has soared between 56% and 89%.In response to better-than-expected second-quarter results, analysts raised their full-year 2014 and 2015 estimates by 10% and 9%, respectively, as of Sept. 30. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters on average anticipate that earnings will climb 44% in 2014 and 9% next year.How The Business GrowsGrowth has come organically and from merger and acquisition activity involving warranty providers, insurance firms, related-service providers and renewal rights.Pipoly counts 33 acquisitions since 2001. That includes the buyout this month of Comp Options Insurance (a Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Florida subsidiary) and acquiring, in mid-September, the renewal rights to Tower Group International's (TWGP) commercial policies. ""We think (Tower) is going to be a $500-million-a-year premium opportunity for us and we integrated that premium onto our book already,"" Pipoly told IBD. ""Comp is expected to be a $40-million to $45 -million-a-year premium acquisition.""AmTrust owns 14 companies but is hungry for more buyout targets. With a market value of $3.3 billion — vs. $35 billion for ACE (ACE), the largest name in its industry group — AmTrust has plenty of potential for growth or to be acquired itself.""We will look at opportunities to hopefully ferret out transactions that are below the radar, in which we have the opportunity to maybe be the only one involved in looking at an acquisition,"" Pipoly said. ""Our ability to find those M&A opportunities, execute on those M&A opportunities, and also integrate successfully those acquisition opportunities, served us very well over the past 14 years.""AmTrust also owns five foreign companies and operates in 13 countries with 95 offices worldwide, deriving about a third of its business overseas. It recently bought a warranty administrator in Malaysia to offer extended warranty products in Southeast Asia, home to a rapidly growing middle class.Interest Rate RiskOne of the biggest risks hanging over the insurance industry is the prospect of rising interest rates.The Federal Reserve is expected to influence rates upward in 2015, and rising rates would erode prices of insurers' fixed-income investments. However, most of AmTrust's $5.08 billion investment portfolio is in short-duration bonds of about five years, which are less sensitive to interest-rate changes than are longer-duration government bonds.Investors must consider that the insurance industry is highly regulated and failure to comply with government codes could lead to massive fines and suspension of business. It's also very prone to adverse court decisions, says Ken Billingsley, an analyst with Compass Point Research & Trading.""Future court decisions could have a material impact on policies written in the past,"" Billingsley wrote of the industry in a client note Aug. 7. ""Even after claims have been settled, adverse court rulings could expose insurers to additional and unintended risk.""

191,AIG,"Hurricane Arthur is roaring up the East Coast. It has forced millions of people to worry about the risk to their homes and businesses.And it's a reminder about the importance of gauging your need for flood insurance. Why? Because standard homeowners insurance policies exclude flood losses.You may need flood insurance no matter where you live in the U.S.In the past five years, flooding has caused damage in all 50 states, the Insurance Information Institute says. U.S. flood losses average $50 billion per year.Generally, flood coverage comes from the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), which is part of FEMA. If your community participates in the NFIP, flood insurance is available to local homeowners, renters and business owners.Prices are fixed, depending on how vulnerable your area and your property are to flooding. NFIP flood-insurance policies are sold by private insurers. You may be able to get this coverage from the same agent who handles your homeowners policy.And there is some relief from rising flood-insurance premiums. The Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act was signed into law in March.The new law rescinds many of the cost hikes that were created by a 2012 federal flood-insurance law. The new version also generally caps future rate increases to 18% a year.In addition, the 2014 act removes a provision requiring home buyers to pay steep prices for flood insurance. Sellers said that the requirement made it harder to close deals.In some cases, premium refunds are available. If you bought a new NFIP policy after July 5, 2012, contact your agent to see if you can get money back.Paying PremiumsYou can choose any one of seven levels of NFIP coverage. For a residential building, the range is $35,000 to $250,000. For a building's contents, it's $10,000 to $100,000.You can insure your building, its contents or both.The standard premium for maximum coverage (building and contents) is $1,958 a year. That's for a single-family, one-story primary residence with no basement and $1,000 deductibles for the building and contents.Premiums are higher for a vacation home.Preferred-risk policies cost less. They're available to homes in certain flood zones if the house has a favorable flood loss history.The same maximum coverage costs only $414 a year for a preferred risk, or $460 for preferred-risk homes with basements.But NFIP premiums in high-risk areas are steeper than standard. The amount can run into five figures, depending on elevation and building construction.What if you want more than the maximum NFIP coverage, which tops out at $250,000 and $100,000, for building and contents?Some insurers offer flood policies that replace or supplement NFIP coverage with higher payout caps. Companies in this market include Chubb (CB), American International Group (AIG) and Fireman's Fund.Other insurers have been eyeing the flood-insurance market, attracted by the higher NFIP rates under the 2012 law. But the 2014 rates' reversal may have dampened interest among private insurers.If you decide to buy flood insurance through the NFIP, keep in mind that there's usually a 30-day waiting period before your policy goes into effect. That's to keep people from buying coverage right after the TV weather report warns that floods are on the way.

205,AIG,"Investors are piling into U.S. hotels, hoping to cash in on stabilized occupancy and rising room rates amid a climate of cheap debt and depressed supply. It's a mix that has generated profits for the last three years and portends more of the same for the near future.
"
206,AIG,"Through the end of May, hotel buyers and sellers had conducted $8.3 billion in transactions in the U.S., a year-over-year increase of $300 million, according to the Hotels & Hospitality Group of Chicago-based property broker Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL).
"
207,AIG,"JLL also projects that lodging sales will reach $25 billion this year, a 13.6% increase over 2013.
"
208,AIG,"The record-high stock market and rebounding home values have made consumers feel more confident and comfortable about taking vacations, said Arthur Adler, Americas CEO and managing director of JLL's hospitality group. On the business side, the modest economic recovery coupled with slow job growth has necessitated more travel for workers, he added.
"
209,AIG,"More recently, group travelers have begun to book rooms with increasing frequency, which should give the industry a further boost, say Adler and Scott Smith, senior vice president in the Atlanta office of PKF Consulting USA, an advisory and real estate firm specializing in the hospitality industry.
"
210,AIG,"Fundamental Rebound
"
211,AIG,"The important group-bookings segment, which includes state organizations, business meeting groups and worker incentive travel programs, pulled back not only because of the slow recovery, but also as result of the negative reactions to the American International Group's (AIG) widely publicized retreat at a swanky resort soon after receiving bailout funds, Smith said.
"
212,AIG,"Only now is the group travel segment beginning to book rooms on par with its activity before the recession, which should give the industry a further boost, he adds.
"
213,AIG,"""I've been doing this for 25 years and have never seen the kind of economics that are driving hotel revenues right now,"" said Smith, referring to the steady rise in fundamentals and lagging construction of new rooms. ""We think we're in a real sweet spot.""
"
214,AIG,"Investors think so, too. The R.W. Baird/STR Hotel Stock Index, which tracks the 15 largest publicly traded hotel companies, is up 11% year-to-date, outpacing the S&P 500 by about five percentage points.
"
215,AIG,"Three of the six largest companies by market cap in IBD's Leisure-Lodging industry group are up by double-digit percentages this year: Marriott International 30%, Intercontinental Hotels Group (IHG) 24% and Hyatt Hotels (H) 23%.
"
216,AIG,"Profits across all hotels rose an average of 10.1% in 2013, the third straight year of double-digit gains, according to PKF Consulting's research affiliate. It predicts that profits will increase more than 10% in 2014 and 2015 as average daily rates, occupancy and revenue per available room (RevPAR) — a gauge of hotel profitability — exceed pre-recession levels.
"
217,AIG,"Hendersonville, Tenn.-based STR, a research firm covering the hotel industry, reported that the average daily rate finished the week of June 14 at $115.61, a year-over-year increase of 4.4%, and that average occupancy increased 2% to 71.6% over the same period in 2013. RevPAR ended the week at $82.82, on average, a 6.5% year-over-year hike.
"
218,AIG,"Occupancy gains supported the bulk of income growth coming out of the recession, but now rising room rates are doing a more lucrative job, said Arthur Adler, Americas CEO and managing director of JLL's hotels and hospitality group.
"
219,AIG,"""Even if you have no occupancy increase, to the extent hotels can increase their room rate, the more of that increase falls to the bottom line,"" he says.
"
220,AIG,"Pipeline Growing
"
221,AIG,"Experts downplay a rising construction pipeline — at least for the near term. More than 114,300 hotel rooms were under construction at the end of the first quarter, a year-over-year jump of 40%, according to Portsmouth, N.H.-based Lodging Econometrics.
"
222,AIG,"Nearly 293,000 more rooms were in the pipeline, with some 161,700 of them slated to begin construction in the next 12 months, Lodging Econometrics said, although not all are likely to get built.
"
223,AIG,"Developers are adding most rooms in the branded upper- and mid-scale select service segments, the firm reported, which include Marriott International's (MAR) Residence Inn, Hilton Worldwide Holdings' (HLT) Hilton Garden Inn and InterContinental Hotels Group's Holiday Inn Express.
"
224,AIG,"Developers all but shut down new construction as occupancy and daily rates plummeted amid the recession. Historically the supply of new rooms typically grew 2% a year, said Lauro Ferroni, vice president, research and strategic advisory with JLL's hospitality group. But construction has fallen well short of that over the last few years — it was less than 1% in 2013, for example, and this year supply is expected to grow by 1%, he said.
"
225,AIG,"For now, Smith thinks new supply will impact the market around 2018, which should translate into continued investment activity for the foreseeable future.
"
226,AIG,"""Who knows what's going to really happen in 2018 — or tomorrow?"" he asks. A drastic change in gas or airfare prices could affect hotel performance, he acknowledged, but the fact that room demand is outstripping supply has reduced investment risk when compared with previous cycles.
"
227,AIG,"Private Equity Leads Way
"
228,AIG,"Through May this year, private equity funds such as RockBridge Capital and KSL Capital Partners completed 33% of the hotel transactions, according to JLL. RLJ Lodging Trust (RLJ), Summit Hotel Properties (INN) and other real estate investment trusts conducted 21% of the deals.
"
229,AIG,"Foreign buyers are also expressing more interest and are expected to plunk down $3 billion for hotels this year, Adler said. High-net-worth individuals and institutional investors such as life insurance companies and pension funds are pursuing lodging properties, too.
"
230,AIG,"In mid-June, however, the Charlottesville, Va.-based financial research firm SNL Financial noted that REITs had shelled out $1.2 billion for hotels in 2014, a year-over-year decrease of 11%.
"
231,AIG,"A slowdown in REIT acquisitions isn't unexpected, Adler said. The companies typically start buying at a downturn's end and then pull back later in the cycle as private equity funds that tap high amounts of debt plow into the market and push up prices.
"
232,AIG,"During the Pebblebrook Hotel Trust's (PEB) first-quarter conference call in late April, for example, company CEO Jon Bortz noted that after pursuing a successful acquisition strategy early in the cycle, the company was happy to ""cede"" the market to highly leveraged buyers. Plus, he added, fewer quality assets were hitting the market.
"
233,AIG,"The Bethesda, Md.-based owner of upscale hotels and resorts shelled out $376.3 million for 1,083 rooms in five properties over the last 18 months, according to SNL Financial data.
"
234,AIG,"""We've gotten to the point where existing owners look out a couple of years and say, 'Wow, it looks pretty good, why should I be in a hurry to sell if I don't need to?'"" Bortz said. ""Even in our target markets, we think values are well above what we're willing to pay based on our three- to five-year outlook.""Investors are piling into U.S. hotels, hoping to cash in on stabilized occupancy and rising room rates amid a climate of cheap debt and depressed supply.

245,AIG,"MetLife, the largest U.S. life insurer, is turning to real estate to bolster profit and support long-term obligations amid low bond yields.

Another, Amsterdam-based AerCap Holdings (AER), has recently climbed onto IBD's list of top 10 world stocks. AerCap leases mostly large jet aircraft to commercial carriers…
"
277,AIG,"It takes a lot of money to operate an airline. You can spend billions of dollars building up a fleet of aircraft, then spend billions more every year just to keep the planes fueled up.Because it takes a lot of money, airlines need ready access to financing. The problem is, banks aren't keen to lend money to airlines with a spotty financial record — especially given the fickle nature of the airline industry, which can quickly turn sour when the economy turns south.Airlines that don't make the cut at the lending table can still build up their fleets through lease agreements, however. According to industry estimates, the leasing industry accounts for around 40% of the $100 billion spent each year on new airliners.Global demand for leasing services is so great that the industry includes scores of players of all stripes and sizes.One of the top players is Air Lease Corp. (AL), which provides leasing services for narrow body, wide body and turboprop aircraft.Air Lease buys its own planes and then leases them to airline customers. At the end of 2013 it had 79 customers in 47 countries. More than 90% of its business comes from outside the U.S. and Canada.Although Air Lease was founded in 2010 and went public the next year, its management team has been in the business for decades.Industry OriginsFounder and CEO Steven Udvar-Hazy is credited with inventing the airline leasing business in 1973 when he co-founded International Lease Finance Corp., or ILFC. Air Lease President and Chief Operating Officer John Plueger is a seasoned industry veteran who also logged time at ILFC.Air Lease's management team is a big reason that the company has seen revenue more than double over the past two years and its stock price rise nearly 40% since its initial public offering in April 2011, analysts say.""It's not just a financing business — they are so much more than that,"" said Jason Arnold, analyst at RBC Capital Markets. ""Steve Hazy and John Plueger know airplanes inside and out. They get the product that the airlines need and are able to construct attractive financing packages. Their experience and expertise are key positive factors in the business' success.""Air Lease is also one of the rare leasing companies that actually buy the planes directly from manufacturers such as Boeing (BA) and Airbus.Many competitors operate a lease-back model where airlines buy the aircraft they need and then sell those aircraft to leasing companies, which then lease the planes back to the airlines.""The biggest advantage for Air Lease is that they buy aircraft for their own book,"" said Helane Becker, analyst at Cowen & Co.By buying its own aircraft, she says, Air Lease has more control over the negotiation process on the purchasing end — as well as the sales end.""Air Lease negotiates with Boeing or Airbus and says, 'We'll take on X number of aircraft over the next few years,'"" Becker said. ""They can then go to Air India or another airline and say, 'We have these planes coming, would you like to take an order for it?' It gives Air Lease greater control and visibility.""Air Lease had a fleet of 193 aircraft at the end of 2013. On a fourth-quarter conference call with analysts, Plueger said the company's average fleet age ""remained very low, at 3.7 years, with a long average of 7.1 years remaining on its leases.""""We concluded the year with one of the largest order books in our industry, having 327 aircraft on order now, delivering through 2023,"" Plueger added. ""Having concluded all new aircraft placements in 2014 and '15, our focus now turns to 2016, where we'll begin transitioning towards strong order book of new generation aircraft.""Passengers AplentyDuring the conference call, Udvar-Hazy also cited data from the International Air Transport Association (IATA) showing that global passenger traffic for 2013 increased 5.2%. That was in line with the average annual growth rates for the past 30 years.""This statistic is overwhelmingly positive for the health of the airline industry, and we have now seen several consecutive years of overall global airline profitability,"" Udvar-Hazy said.In an e-mail to IBD, Ryan McKenna, an Air Lease vice president, said demand for new aircraft to replace aging planes ""remains very robust. We continue to work closely with airlines as they develop fleet plans to modernize their aircraft operations.""Air Lease's own financial returns reflect the industry's strength. In 2013, its quarterly sales growth never dipped below 23%, while its earnings per share growth never fell below 28%.The company earned 55 cents a share during the 2013 fourth quarter, a 45% gain from a year earlier and above consensus estimates. Revenue grew 28% to $242.9 million.Air Lease shares touched a record high of 38.15 on March 21 and traded near 37 on Monday.""Certainly, industry trends are beneficial, including the fact that leasing is gaining market share as a percentage of overall aircraft finance,"" analyst Arnold said. ""There are also a lot of aircraft being delivered by Boeing and Airbus, which has been very supportive of Air Lease's business.""Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect earnings of 51 cents a share for Air Lease's first quarter, up from 38 cents a year earlier. They expect revenue to rise 25% to $240.3 million.In addition to privately held aircraft leasing firms — there are about 100 of those, Becker says — Air Lease also competes against General Electric's (GE) Capital Aviation Services, which ranks No. 1 in the sector. Other publicly traded rivals include Aircastle (AYR) and Fly Leasing (FLY).Air Lease also competes against AerCap Holdings (AER), a Dutch company about to get a whole lot bigger when it closes its buyout of American International Group 's (AIG) ILFC, Udvar-Hazy's former company. That $5.4 billion deal, announced in December, will more than triple the AerCap fleet to nearly 1,400 planes, putting it second behind the GE unit. The deal is expected to close this quarter.Air Lease will likely eye acquisition opportunities of its own, though on a smaller scale, according to Arnold.In a note, JPMorgan analyst Jamie Baker said the company might keep an eye on financial institutions looking to sell their own aircraft portfolios.In addition, Air Lease will look for opportunities to build its fleet by swooping in to get planes that airlines don't want. ""If an airline decides it only needs 20 planes instead of 30, Air Lease sits at the front of the line in terms of getting those extra planes,"" Arnold said.

323,AIG,"If there's one certainty in business, it's that anytime someone comes up with a new way of doing things, someone else will come up with a new way to rip it off.
"
324,AIG,"Cloud computing is no different. While the cloud has changed the way users can access, share and store data over the Internet, it also has opened up new avenues for hackers and other cybercriminals to ply their trade.
"
325,AIG,"Such risks, in turn, have boosted the need for precautions, opening up new opportunities for companies that make security and compliance applications geared to cloud computing environments.
"
326,AIG,"Qualys (QLYS), one such company, has seen demand rise for its solutions as more IT departments seek protection from security breaches that can happen via the cloud.
"
327,AIG,"Broadly, Qualys provides cloud security and compliance solutions designed to help customers identify security risks to their IT infrastructures and protect their systems from cyberattacks.
"
328,AIG,"The firm's QualysGuard Cloud Platform is an integrated suite of solutions that includes vulnerability management, Web application scanning and malware detection as well as policy compliance and payment card industry (PCI) compliance features.
"
329,AIG,"Its product lineup also includes Qualys Secure Seal, which lets businesses scan their websites for malware, find network or Web application vulnerabilities and validate the integrity of SSL certificates, which are a key part of secure browsing.
"
330,AIG,"Qualys' revenue has more than doubled in the past five years as rising use of cloud applications has driven greater demand for security products and solutions.
"
331,AIG,"""With the shift to cloud, enterprises are increasingly in need of solutions that can identity and prioritize threats,"" Rob Owens, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities, noted following Qualys' third-quarter earnings report last week. ""Qualys is well-positioned to capitalize on these secular trends within compliance and application security.""
"
332,AIG,"Insights On Risk
"
333,AIG,"The lion's share of Qualys' business comes from subscriptions to its vulnerability management solution. Organizations use it to manage their security with centralized reports, threat remedies and a remediation workflow. The reports let customers identify the severity of their security issues, find out how long it will take to fix them, and understand how they can impact business.
"
334,AIG,"Qualys has ample room to grow its vulnerability management business, Owens says. He notes that ""only 20% to 25% of existing customers are fully deployed on (vulnerability management) across their entire infrastructure and 75% own just one Qualys solution.""
"
335,AIG,"Meanwhile, Qualys has also taken steps to diversify its revenue stream.
"
336,AIG,"On a third-quarter conference call with analysts, Qualys CEO Philippe Courtot indicated that 84% of the company's revenue through the first three quarters of 2013 came from its vulnerability management solutions. While that's still a pretty big percentage, it is down from 87% the previous year.
"
337,AIG,"""We continue to make meaningful progress diversifying our revenue base ... due to increased sales of our Web application scanning and policy compliance solutions, both of which continue to show strong growth,"" Courtot said.
"
338,AIG,"With Qualys' Web application scanning tool, clients can test their apps without having to install or maintain software. They can test apps anywhere, including via internal networks or in cloud platforms.
"
339,AIG,"Qualys' policy compliance solutions are designed to let IT security and compliance professionals define policies describing how an organization will provide security and integrity. The solutions also provide documented evidence that compliance lapses have been discovered and fixed.
"
340,AIG,"These and other tools serve a wide variety of different companies and industries.
"
341,AIG,"Big Companies Are Clients
"
342,AIG,"During the third quarter alone, Qualys added new accounts from Fortune 500 firms American International Group (AIG), Humana (HUM), Clorox (CLX), Barnes & Noble (BKS) and McGraw-Hill (MHFI), and public entities such as the city of Glendale, Calif., the University of Connecticut Health Center and the University of Cincinnati.
"
343,AIG,"Once clients are on board, they tend to stick around. Analyst Owens says that Qualys has ""very stable"" recurring revenue.
"
344,AIG,"""Security and compliance spending continue to be a priority with CIOs, and the company's products are well suited to address the massive shifts taking place in IT environments,"" Owens said in a research note.
"
345,AIG,"Among the solutions Qualys is working on now is an advanced malware protection service that will be built on its cloud platform. This service is designed to give customers protection against malware in extracted documents from inbound network traffic. Qualys expects the service to be released for beta testing in the second quarter of 2014.
"
346,AIG,"The combination of recurring revenue and new products has helped Qualys deliver quarter after quarter of double-digit top-line growth.
"
347,AIG,"On Nov. 4, it reported third-quarter revenue of $27.8 million. That was up 19% from a year earlier and slightly ahead of estimates. Earnings fell 20% to 8 cents a share, topping views for 5 cents.
"
348,AIG,"The EPS decline needs context: Qualys had its initial public offering in September 2012, so its Q3 results this year were being compared to its final quarter as a private company. The share count was much lower then, which is why the per-share earnings were lower this time even though the company's net income rose 9% .
"
349,AIG,"Qualys stock, up 42% this year through Wednesday, touched a high of 23.21 in September. It currently trades near 21.
"
350,AIG,"Analysts are bullish about Qualys' growth prospects. They expect full-year earnings to rise 45% in 2014 and 31% in 2015.
"
351,AIG,"""We remain upbeat on the company's opportunity as a leading provider of cloud-based security and compliance solutions as additional solutions are increasingly adopted by the installed base,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Robert Breza noted.If there's one certainty in business, it's that anytime someone comes up with a new way of doing things, someone else will come up with a new way to rip it off.Cloud computing is no different.

445,AIG,"Love those protective moats.
"
446,AIG,"Columbia Marsico Focused Equities Fund aims for quality growth companies whose use of technology creates a protective moat around them.
"
447,AIG,"That investment approach is paying off this year for the $1.2 billion fund. Columbia Marsico Focused Equities is having its best year since 2009. The fund, which is the sister portfolio of no-load Marsico Focus , was up 28.04% this year through Oct. 31.
"
448,AIG,"That topped 77% of the fund's large-cap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Inc.
"
449,AIG,"That's also far better than the fund's five-year average annual gain of 14.43%, which topped just 29% of its rivals.
"
450,AIG,"Thomas Marsico, 58, and 42-year-old co-manager Coralie Witter talked with IBD from their offices in Denver. They were joined by analysts Dr. Matt Norkunas, John Machock, Kevin Boone and James Marsico, Tom's son.
"
451,AIG,"IBD: You like technology's impact more than you like tech companies, right?
"
452,AIG,"Marsico: The theme of the portfolio and the theme we look for in growth markets is innovation and technology.
"
453,AIG,"But we usually are not direct investors in technology because they have short product cycles.
"
454,AIG,"And pricing around those products goes down in line with Moore's Law (which says that microchip performance generally doubles about every two years) or sometimes much deeper.
"
455,AIG,"So you have to sell more and more of the product just to stay even. Instead, we like companies that use innovative technology to create moats around their businesses.
"
456,AIG,"IBD: You've also said you look for companies with a catalyst. How does that work?
"
457,AIG,"Marsico: Generally, we are looking for strong companies. Their catalyst might be superior execution of a business plan.
"
458,AIG,"Take the retail concept area. We've owned TJX Cos. (TJX) for a long time. They built a moat by providing quality goods at lower prices. That's a moat because they have 30,000 points of touch with various suppliers, to find the best branded products at low prices. That's a difficult model to build. And they're expanding into Europe.
"
459,AIG,"IBD: How often do you look for turnaround situations sparked by a catalyst?
"
460,AIG,"Marsico: Sometimes, as far as change is concerned, we look for a life-cycle-change company. We have two financial stocks like that: Citigroup (C) and AIG (AIG).
"
461,AIG,"Both came through the financial crisis with a lot of restructuring that needed to be done. Both were trading at large discounts to book value.
"
462,AIG,"But the brands they established over decades were still intact, and the book value of assets held on their balance sheets was greater than what was reflected on their stock prices. With better management teams, they have turned around. The catalysts were positive changes in management, resetting their cost structures, and re-establishment of the financial markets after the turmoil of the crisis in 2008.
"
463,AIG,"But the main focus of the portfolio is imbedded in unit growth companies. Mostly as a result of the application of technology to various markets.
"
464,AIG,"IBD: Why is the fund doing better this year?
"
465,AIG,"Witter: With less volatility around policy risk, we're in an environment where stock picking is now being rewarded again. That had not been true for years. And that lends itself to active management, such as we do.
"
466,AIG,"Combined with low inflation, that favors the quality growth names where we do the bulk of our research.
"
467,AIG,"IBD: Tom, how do you and Coralie divide duties? Do you follow stocks in different sectors? Or do you backstop each other?
"
468,AIG,"Marsico: Our work is collaborative. We communicate multiple times a day. We don't follow different sectors. We come to agreement on names. We have dialogue and debate to increase our overall confidence and conviction in names we buy. That makes for a healthy process.
"
469,AIG,"IBD: You recently opened a stake in Facebook (FB), whose earnings per share growth jumped to 108% in the most recent quarter from 0% two quarters prior. What's its driver?
"
470,AIG,"James Marsico: We try to find companies that are aggressively going after specific trends in the technology space. And consumption of content, which is moving from desktop to mobile devices, is where we seek to target certain opportunities.
"
471,AIG,"One thing that's unique about Facebook is that mobile revenue growth has accelerated meaningfully as people move from desktop to mobile consumption.
"
472,AIG,"When the company went public (May 18, 2012), they had zero realized revenue from those mobile-device users. Now, in the most recent quarter, mobile revenue accounted for 41% of their total revenue base. So the company has solved a problem in 12 to 18 months and started capturing and unlocking value in their user base accessing the platform from a mobile device.
"
473,AIG,"IBD: Which of its acquisitions do you like?
"
474,AIG,"James Marsico: Facebook made a $1 billion investment in Instagram about a year ago. Recently some people saw that as a signal that user engagement was slowing on Facebook. Now it looks as if Instagram is taking disproportionate share away from other online websites and platforms. And the current valuation of about $10 billion on the Instagram platform shows significant return on investment, giving us confidence in the company's ability to understand the marketplace and recognize trends and where viewers are going.
"
475,AIG,"IBD: Facebook and Google's (GOOG) efforts are aimed at boosting advertising revenue.
"
476,AIG,"Witter: To tie those two ideas into themes that we're highlighting today, those two companies are competing in a large global market that is growing. They are taking share through the shift to online advertising, where consumer behavior is shifting. Both companies benefit from a network effect that their business models enjoy. They've created products that increase in value the more that people use it. That is the moat around their businesses. The opportunity set around both companies is tremendous.
"
477,AIG,"Google has less than 10% of the global advertising market and is growing at a 20% compound annual rate. Facebook, which is younger and smaller, is growing around a 50% pace this year. They are share gainers using investments they made to stay ahead of the competition and gain share in growing markets.
"
478,AIG,"IBD: Have you increased your stake in Green Mountain Coffee Roasters (GMCR) because of its new products?
"
479,AIG,"Marsico: They're one of our smallest positions. Their new CEO came from Coke. He has a good understanding of how to manage a global beverage product.
"
480,AIG,"Green Mountain has 90% of the K-Cup market. But the current debate around this company is whether private label competitors that make coffee will gather more share. And there's interest in the short community, highlighted by David Einhorn's position at Greenlight Capital.
"
481,AIG,"But we believe Green Mountain's new management is executing well. They're finding new customers for their K-Cups, they have a relationship with Starbucks (SBUX), and we don't think (Starbucks' Chairman, President and CEO) Howard Schultz would have a relationship if he didn't think they had the best product. Starbucks tried to develop their own K-Cup, but then deferred to Green Mountain, which will have a new product next year (soup in partnership with Campbell's Soup). They've also done a good job of getting into stores similar to but smaller than Starbucks'.
"
482,AIG,"IBD: What about their upcoming new brewing machines for specialty coffees?
"
483,AIG,"Witter: What got us into the stock is the big picture. Single-serve is taking share from ground coffee. And 2014 should see acceleration in that trend when the company comes out with a new brewer and demonstrates the benefits of their manufacturing efficiencies.
"
484,AIG,"IBD: Speaking of Starbucks, what's the thesis there?
"
485,AIG,"Marsico: They have seven or eight drivers. They have a number of initiatives. Their same-store sales growth is accelerating. They are executing better within stores. Their service is getting faster. They keep coming out with new beverage innovations like pumpkin spice latte around the holidays. And they've improved their food, which increases the attachment of food to beverage items. They acquired a company called La Boulange, which takes their food quality up.
"
486,AIG,"On top of that, these guys are the poster boys of using Facebook and other digital media to drive more business into their stores. That's looped in with a Starbucks loyalty card. It started as a physical card, now it's an app.
"
487,AIG,"The third leg of their growth is in the consumer packaged goods area. They're getting close to the point where anything sold in the store belongs to Starbucks. And they can use their thousands of stores as a launch platform for new products.
"
488,AIG,"IBD: You've trimmed your Biogen Idec (BIIB) stake. Is that for risk management, or are you cooling on the stock?
"
489,AIG,"Machock: There's no change in our view. As share price increases, we trim positions.
"
490,AIG,"They've come up with a new (treatment) molecule for multiple sclerosis. Other (treatments) didn't cure the disease. They just slowed its progression. And you had to take a large injection in the leg daily.
"
491,AIG,"Biogen's new (treatment) is an oral drug, so that improves compliance. It also avoids some of the side effects of one of the other approaches. Their new treatment has captured 12.5% of the total MS market. And 60% to 70% of new patients are using this new drug.
"
492,AIG,"IBD: Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) gapped up. It beat Q3 views. What's your thesis?
"
493,AIG,"Witter: It's one of the most unique restaurant concepts created in some time. Even at peak hours, lines of customers move quickly. They assemble your bowl or burrito quickly. They can do it because of labor efficiency.
"
494,AIG,"And they offer high-quality items at reasonable prices, earning record margins. They can quintuple their store base in the U.S., so they have a highly visible length of opportunity. They're also opening stores in Europe. They're applying their labor efficiency to their ShopHouse Southeast Asian concept.Love those protective moats.Columbia Marsico Focused Equities Fund aims for quality growth companies whose use of technology creates a protective moat around them.That investment approach is paying off this year for the $1.2 billion fund.

Its current real estate projects are limited to a few joint ventures with one European partner, the Journal reported.But U.S. apartment construction is hot in many markets now as many potential buyers, stung by the last housing bubble, sit on the sidelines and rent.The U.S. still owns 70% of AIG. Last month the company said it still owes the government about $45 billion.Several analysts have upgraded the insurer in recent weeks on prospects that it can successfully divest — through sales or public offering spinoffs — several noncore businesses, to raise cash and pay back taxpayers before the end of the year.AIG has identified its aircraft-leasing unit, International Lease Finance Corp., as one likely IPO candidate.

504,AIG,"American International Group Inc. (AIG  -  Free Report) reported first-quarter 2018 operating earnings of $1.04 per share that missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 16%. In the year-ago quarter, the company had reported earnings of $1.36 per share.The underperformance stemmed from the impact of huge catastrophe losses and low premium in the General Insurance as well as Life and Retirement segments.Shares of the company were down 2.6% after the dismal results.American International Group, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise American International Group, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | American International Group, Inc. QuoteWeak Segment PerformanceGeneral Insurance Suffers From Catastrophe LossThe segment was saddled with $376 million of losses primarily related to the California mudslides, U.S. winter storms and the Papua New Guinea earthquake, as well as $135 million of severe losses that led to an underwriting loss of $251 million compared with $12 million of underwriting income in the year-ago quarter.Net premium written of $6.2 billion was also down 2% year over year due to the net impact of the company’s reinsurance program and the strategic portfolio actions in U.S. Casualty and Property.Combined ratio of 103.8% deteriorated a massive 400 basis points year over year, primarily due to an increase in loss ratio, which was due to huge catastrophe losses.Disappointing Life and Retirement Unit ResultsPremium and fees of $1.18 billion decreased 23% year over year, led by an 80% decline in contribution from the Institutional Market sub segment.Pre-tax income, was also down 1% from the prior-year quarter to $892 million.Share RepurchaseIn the first quarter, AIG repurchased 5.4 million common shares for $298 million and warrants for $2 million. As of May 2, 2018, approximately $2.0 billion remained under the share repurchase authorization.Financial PositionAt the end of the first quarter, the insurer’s adjusted book value per share (excluding AOCI) was $56.10, up 2.5% from year the Dec 31, 2017 level.Core adjusted return on equity (ROE) was 8.6%, down 160 basis points year over year.Our TakeThe company’s dismal results reflect its continuing pain, which is reflected in declining revenues for the past many years. The company has been suffering from declining premium due to disciplined underwriting, competitive market conditions and reduction in business due to numerous divestitures taken. Challenges in the property and casualty market, and continued business dispositions will continue to keep the top line under pressure in the coming quarters.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderAIG carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).

505,AIG,"The first-quarter earnings season has crossed halfway mark with already 267 members of the elite S&P 500 index having reported financial numbers so far.  Per the latest Earnings Preview, the beat ratio is impressive with 76.8% companies surpassing bottom-line expectations and a 73.8%, outperforming on the top-line front, thereby bearing evidence to a solid start. Combining the reported results with estimates for the yet-to-release companies, total earnings for the S&P 500 index are anticipated to be up 22.6% from the same period last year, driven by 8.4% growth in revenues.The Finance sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors) has delivered a strong performance till now. Per Earnings Preview, earnings are expected to rise 26.4% on 5.7% higher revenues.An important constituent of the Finance sector, the insurance industry is likely to witness better results this yet-to-be-reported quarter on the back of an improving rate environment, tax cuts, a favorable operating environment and a better domestic growth scenario.A progressing interest rate environment is likely to have driven solid net investment income, a chief component of an insurer’s top line. Though the metric is far from achieving a historical high, it nonetheless shows an upward trend. Notably, the Fed has hiked interest rate five times since December 2015 on the back of a flourishing economy and has expressed intention to raise the same twice more this year, followed by three in 2019 and a couple of in 2020.Although insurers have curbed their exposure to interest-sensitive product lines to withstand the low rate environment, they look to take advantage of the increasing rates as investment yield betters.The first quarter is likely to gain an edge from the tax cut.  Per the new tax law effective January 2018, the tax incidence has been decreased to 21% from 35%. This lowering of the rate has added an impetus to insurers’ bottom line.Although the to-be-reported quarter stumbled upon a California mudslide as well as the northeast winter storms, the company’s underwriting profitability might still be left unscathed despite the cat events. Insurers having already suffered the hazards of weather-related loss in 2017, should have managed to make up for the underperformances in the first quarter of 2018. A Morgan Stanley analyst projects global insured cat loss between $5 billion and $10 billion. Underwriting profitability also seems slightly burdened.However, improved pricing, intelligent underwriting practices, portfolio restructuring as well as taking recourse to reinsurance covers might have shielded insurers to overcome the deficits.A varied product portfolio, global growth and tactical M&A activity are expected to have boosted insurers’ operations in the impending quarterly release.About 900 companies (142 S&P 500 members) are set to report quarterly results this week. Let’s see how things shape up for a few good insurers below before their earnings announcement on May 2.American International Group, Inc. (AIG  -  Free Report) is expected to witness flat to a slight decline in revenues due to its ongoing efforts in managing the overall business portfolio via reinsurance and divestitures. Low tax rate and share buyback should boost bottom line. Premiums and deposits at Life Insurance business are expected to increase led by strong growth in both term and universal life insurance sales. However, in General Insurance business, premiums are expected to decline due to the company’s remediation of underperforming lines and divestitures.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.24 per share for the soon-to-be-reported quarter highlights an 8.8% year-over-year fall. AIG carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), which decreases the predictive power of ESP. Although its Earnings ESP of +1.78% makes us confident about an earnings surprise, the stock’s bearish Zacks Rank leaves surprise prediction inconclusive.

We expect an increase in total Life Insurance sales in the first quarter from higher Executive Benefit sales and gains in Variable Universal Life and term products combined with a consistently high demand for MoneyGuard. Tax reform will likely expand Lincoln National’s margin. Its balance sheet strength and a sturdy capital inflow are also part of the estimate.The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.94 for the soon-to-be-reported quarter, inching up 1% year over year. Though Lincoln has a favorable Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), an Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.

As a big investor in the U.S. fixed income market, MetLife should have benefited from economic growth, leading to higher interest rates. However, earnings in Retirement and Income Solutions should be pressured by the flatter yield curve.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.17 per share for the last completed quarter translates into a 19.9% year-over-year decline. MetLife carries a Zacks Rank of 3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. Nonetheless, its Earnings ESP of -0.06% leaves our surprise prediction inconclusive as the company also needs a positive ESP to increase the odds of an earnings surprise.

(PRU  -  Free Report) is expected to have witnessed bottom-line growth in the soon-to-be-reported quarter owing to recurring premium sales, expanded product offerings, broader distribution capabilities and share buybacks. Core performance of its businesses is mainly fueled by higher fees in its Annuities and Investment Management segments as well as sustained business growth in International Insurance. However, increase in expenses, mainly due to higher insurance and annuity benefits plus general and administrative expenses, is likely to have weighed on the desired margin expansion.The consensus mark of $2.99 per share for the last completed quarter represents a 7.2% year-over-year rise. Prudential’s weak Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) combined with an Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction unlikely.

Quote XL Group Ltd.’s (XL  -  Free Report) powerful international exposure, enhanced capabilities and wide-ranging product offerings will likely fuel premium growth. Lower tax should have driven the bottom line as well as margin expansion. The company might have witnessed an increase in operating expenses this yet-to-be-reported quarter, mainly due to higher net loss and loss expenses incurred as well as on claims and policy benefits. This in turn is anticipated to limit the operating margin expansion as well.The consensus estimate of 95 cents per share reflects a 90% year-over-year improvement. A Zacks Rank of 4 combined with an Earnings ESP of -5.80% induces an unlikely surprise prediction. (Read more: Will Higher Premiums Drive XL Group's Q1 Earnings?)XL Group Ltd.

506,AIG,"American International Group Inc.’s (AIG  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 results scheduled on May 2, are expected to witness flat to a slight decline in revenues due to its ongoing efforts in managing the overall business portfolio via reinsurance and divestitures.The company’s Life Insurance business should show progress, driven by a new modern administrative platform, distribution simplification efforts and narrowed product focus in the United States that should support strong top-line growth. Premiums and deposits are expected to increase led by strong growth in both term and universal life insurance sales.In its Institutional markets, results should benefit from its strong market positioning in pension risk transfers. The company’s strong capabilities in the pension risk transfer business as well as its disciplined pricing and strong balance sheet positions it well to selectively participate in this growing market.In the company’s General Insurance business, premiums are expected to decline due to the company’s remediation of underperforming lines and divestitures.The company expects the adjusted effective tax rate to be approximately 21% to 22% as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act which should improve its after-tax ROE.The company’s newly appointed CEO has made a significant shift in its capital utilization strategy in a bid to turn the stock around and achieve greater profitability. Management now expects to utilize capital for possible acquisitions in international markets, boosting the company’s personal and life lines segments plus investing in the domestic middle market as opposed to its hitherto usage of capital resource for share repurchases. Thus a lower amount of share buyback will somewhat be less accretive to the bottom line.Earnings Surprise HistoryThe company boasts an attractive earnings surprise history.

509,AIG,"The Finance sector will kick off its earnings season this week with major banks reporting quarterly results. The sector’s performance will largely be driven by an improving rate environment, tax cuts, favorable operating environment and better domestic growth scenario. Per the Earnings Preview, earnings for the sector are expected to increase 19.2% on 4.5% higher revenues.Insurers, an important component of Finance sector, are due to report results starting next week. Earnings of the Insurance industry are estimated to grow 15% in the first quarter, given a number of tailwinds favoring its operating environment.Progressing Rate EnvironmentLast quarter marked the sixth rate hike by the Federal Reserve testifying economic stability. The rate now stands at 1.75% with intentions of two more raises in 2018 followed by three in 2019 as well as two in 2020.A Benign Cat EnvironmentThe first quarter of 2018 escaped the inclemency of Mother Nature, though there were cat events like California mudslide and northeast winter storms. A Morgan Stanley analyst estimates global insured cat loss in the first quarter between $5 billion and $10 billion.Nonetheless, insurers having already suffered the rigors of cat loss last year, could manage to weather its first-quarter shortfalls too. Underwriting profitability must have been affected, albeit at a lesser magnitude.However, price hikes, prudent underwriting practices, portfolio repositioning and resorting to reinsurance covers will help insurers withstand the deficits.Tax Reforms and Capital DeploymentPer the implementation of the new tax rate effective first quarter, the tax incidence has been lowered to 21% from 35%.

Moreover, other catalysts like pricing pressure and divestment of noncore assets have pushed acquirers to vie for a competitive edge in the buyout arena. Also given a continued capital inflow, the insurance industry’s available resources remain at an all-time high, helping insurers build a strong liquidity profile.A few high-profile deals struck in the first quarter are American International Group, Inc.’s (AIG  -  Free Report) decision to buy reinsurer Validus Holdings, Ltd. for $5.6 billion in cash. AXA Group’s 100% acquisition of XL Group Ltd (XL  -  Free Report) for $15.3 billion and Fidelity National Financial, Inc.’s agreement to purchase Stewart Information Services Corporation for a $1.2-billion cash-stock deal.Price PerformanceThe Insurance industry has underperformed the S&P 500 index since the onset of the first quarter.

511,AIG,"The fourth-quarter earnings season is in full swing, with 251 members of the elite S&P 500 index having already reported financial numbers so far.  Per the latest Earnings Preview, performances indicate a 16% increase in total earnings on 10.5% higher revenues. The beat ratio is impressive with 80.5% companies surpassing bottom-line expectations and 64.9%, outperforming on the top-line front.On an encouraging note, the Finance sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors) has delivered a strong performance till now. Per the Earnings Preview, earnings are expected to grow 5.7% on 2.8% higher revenues.Industry Sneak PeekThe insurance industry, as an integral component of the Finance sector is likely to perform slightly better in the soon-to-be-reported quarter compared with the third quarter. However, the insurers’ underwriting profitability is still likely to bear the brunt of the California wildfires in the fourth quarter. This downside further added to the woes with the catastrophe modeling firm AIR Worldwide, estimating cat loss at approximately $10.5 billion.However, such a massive loss led insures to brave the price hike that remained flat due to a not-so-active catastrophe environment. This in turn has even helped improving the premiums and driving the top line as well.Also, prudent underwriting practices aided insurers to weather the cat event.Net investment income, an important ingredient of an insurer’s top line, is expected to have substantially improved on the back of a rising interest rate environment. Although the interest rates have been increasing at a slower pace, the impact of rate hike is clearly visible in the insurers’ investment portfolios. Notably, the Fed kept its promise of three hikes in 2017, the last one made in December, having raised enough optimism among investors.Diverse product offerings, a wide geographical footprint and strong client retention are anticipated to have enhanced insurers’ performance in the quarter to be reported.Moreover, the tax reform policy — enacted in December 2017, reducing the tax rate to 21% from 35% — is expected to benefit the insurance industry to a considerable extent. A lower tax rate would aid the companies’ bottom line, boosting margins directly. Additionally, the tax cut is estimated to make U.S. insurers more competitive, globally.With 482 companies (92 S&P 500 members) set to announce earnings results this week, let’s find out how the following insurers are placed ahead of their quarterly releases on Feb 8.American International Group Inc.

The segment is reeling under a rise in core losses and adverse development to account for current loss trends. Given that the company has exited some of its casualty lines business, we expect the top line to remain under pressure.The company’s nature of operations exposes it to weather-related losses.

512,AIG,"American International Group Inc. (AIG  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 8, after market close. Results are expected to suffer from weak performance of its Commercial segment, loss from catastrophes and a lower amount of share buyback.The company’s Commercial insurance segment has been underperforming for several quarters. In 2016, the segment reported a pre-tax operating loss of $2.74 billion while the same registered $1.3 billion in the first nine months of 2017. The segment is reeling under a rise in core losses and adverse development to account for current loss trends. Given that the company has exited some of the casualty lines business, we expect the top line to remain under pressure.The company’s nature of operations exposes it to weather-related losses. Catastrophes have historically imparted volatility to the company’s earnings. The company suffered nearly $3 billion of losses from the recent catastrophic events. AIG expects to incur loss of $500 million from the California wildfires that will hurt fourth-quarter margins. Other players in the same industry, Travelers Companies (TRV  -  Free Report), incurred a loss of $499 million from the same calamity, while Chubb Ltd. (CB  -  Free Report) suffered a loss of $477 million.The company’s newly appointed CEO has made a significant shift in its capital utilization strategy in a bid to turn the stock around and achieve greater profitability. Management now expects to utilize capital for possible acquisitions in international markets, boosting the company’s personal and lifeline segments plus investing in the domestic middle market as opposed to its hitherto usage of capital resource for share repurchases. Thus, a lower amount of share buyback will somewhat be less accretive to the bottom line.Margins will however, see an upside from its cost-control efforts. Some of the actions in this regard were a reduction in headcount, freezing of pension plans and divestiture of underperforming units. These steps led to a 13.4% decline in gross operating expense in 2016, which went further down by 14.5% year over year in the first nine months of 2017. We believe that the company’s strict cost controls will provide an extra cushion to its operating margins.Earnings Surprise HistoryThe company does not have an attractove earnings surprise history. It missed earnings estimates in two of the last four quarters with an avearge negatove surprise of 7.3%. This is depicted in the chart below:American International Group, Inc.

513,AIG,"Multi-line insurer American International Group Inc. (AIG  -  Free Report) expects to incur catastrophe (cat) loss of $2.9 billion to $3.1 billion ($1.9 billion to $2.0 billion after-tax), net of reinsurance, in the third quarter.The loss is related to hurricanes Harvey ($1.1 billion to $1.2 billion), Irma ($1 billion to $1.1 billion) and Maria ($600 million to $700 million). The Mexico earthquake is estimated to cause $150 million of loss.The loss will be incurred in the company’s Commercial segment, which benefited in the previous quarter from low catastrophe loss.We expect the segment’s profitability to suffer in the third quarter from high loss claims at a time when the segment’s top line is already weighed down by challenging market conditions.Year to date, the stock has lost 5.4%, underperforming the industry which recorded growth of 7.2%.  Third-quarter 2017 was one of the costliest in history with respect to cat loss. Mass devastation was seen in parts of the United States which continued to be ravaged by a number of hurricanes one after another.While Harvey rocked Houston and Texas Gulf Coast, Irma ran amok in regions across Caribbean to Florida. Both storms are considered the costliest in a decade. No sooner the country had heaved a sigh of relief, with Hurricane Jose not turning not as destructive, another hurricane, Maria, hit Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Maria is already deemed as a Category 5 storm.Economic losses from Irma are estimated at about $58-$83 billion while the same from Harvey could be as high as $108 billion by Moody’s Analytics. Catastrophe modeling firm AIR Worldwide estimates industry insured losses for Hurricane Maria in the Caribbean between $ 40 billion and $85 billion.Other insurers too have come up with their loss estimates. Assurant Inc. (AIZ  -  Free Report) has estimated between $134 million and $140 million pre-tax of reportable catastrophe losses from Harvey and expects gross losses from Irma to exceed its retention of $125 million pretax.The Travelers Companies, Inc. (TRV  -  Free Report) estimates pre-tax catastrophe loss from Hurricane Harvey between $375 million and $750 million or $245 million and $490 million after tax. HCI Group, Inc. (HCI  -  Free Report) projects loss between $100 million and $300 million from Hurricane Irma.On the face of it, catastrophe losses cause a spike in loss ratio and hurt insurers’ underwriting margins. However, these losses act as catalysts in turning the industry's pricing cycle. The industry which has amassed a huge capital buffer and led to soft pricing (thanks to a benign cat loss environment in recent years) will likely see price hardening in certain lines of business that have been affected  the most.AIG carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

This marked its biggest percentage gain since Apr 24. All of the S&P 500’s 11 sectors ended in the green, led by financials. The Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLF) advanced 1.7%.The financial sector gained from bullish sentiments following weaker than expected impact of Hurricane Irma. The hurricane was initially categorized as a Category 5 hurricane but lost strength after hitting the coast of Florida over the weekend. It has since been degraded to a tropical storm as the impact has been significantly lesser than what had originally been expected by the National Hurricane Centre.Biggest contributors to such gains were stocks of leading insurers.. Shares of Travelers Companies Inc. (TRV  -  Free Report), Progressive Corp. (PGR  -  Free Report), American International Group Inc.

Early last week, reports surfaced from South Korea that Pyongyang would test another missile over the weekend to celebrate its foundation day. In the event of North Korea not going ahead with the test, geopolitical tensions between Pyongyang and Washington were eased and markets were back to normal.Meanwhile, the United States urged the Security Council of the United Nations to impose fresh sanctions on North Korea. The Trump administration wants the United Nations to impose an oil embargo on Pyongyang. This gave rise to fresh tensions as North Korea reacted by saying that the U.S. would eventually pay a ‘due price’ for backing the imposition of sanctions on the Asian country.Stocks That Made HeadlinesEquifax (EFX  -  Free Report) Tanks as Massive Data Breach News SurfacesThe brand image and creditability of Equifax Inc. (EFX  -  Free Report) is in question as very sensitive personal data of approximately 143 million consumers has been stolen from the credit information provider’s database.

515,AIG,"Speculations of massive destruction by Hurricane Irma had rattled the insurance industry. The storm's impact on Florida, however, was not as devastating as expected as it has been downgraded to Category 1. Storm surges were also of a lesser magnitude than the National Hurricane Center’s initial projections.As Irma inflicted lesser damage than feared, insurance stocks bounced back and were among the biggest gainers on the bourses. Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report), in the meanwhile, said that the insurance industry “has strong balance sheet to weather the financial impact” of the storm and has historically performed well after such nerve-wrecking events.Needless to say, the insurance industry is already boosting business operations, implementing new technologies and investing in cybersecurity to drive growth. Thus, investing in sound insurance stocks seems prudent at the moment.Insurance Stocks: The Biggest GainersInsurance stocks had been losing ground for weeks as the hurricanes dampened investors’ sentiments. Rating agency Moody’s cautioned that property and casualty insurers, reinsurers as well as alternative capital providers like the buyers of catastrophe bonds, were all likely to undergo “substantial losses” owing to the hurricanes, particularly Irma. And why not? Irma was expected to be the most powerful hurricane and had already wrecked roads and telecommunications systems in the French Caribbean island territories.The lesser damage has been a blessing in disguise for insurance stocks. Major players like Travelers Companies Inc (TRV  -  Free Report) rallied 2.3% on Sep 11 and was one of the biggest drivers for the Dow Jones. Other significant players, including Progressive Corp (PGR  -  Free Report) and American International Group Inc (AIG  -  Free Report), improved a respective 2.2% and 1.7%.Exchange traded fund that tracks the insurance sector also moved north. The SPDR S&P Insurance ETF (KIE) and the iShares Dow Jones US Insurance Index ETF (IAK) increased 2.2% and nearly 2%, respectively. In fact, the PowerShares KBW Property & Casualty Insurance Portfolio advanced 3.1%, its highest one-day climb since July 2015. This gain helped the fund close in the positive territory for the year. The biggest gainers from the PowerShares fund were Aspen Insurance Holdings Limited (AHL  -  Free Report), Validus Holdings, Ltd. (VR  -  Free Report) and Maiden Holdings, Ltd. (MHLD  -  Free Report), which saw a respective rally of 9.4%, 6.9% and 7.1%.Irma Fears DodgedInsurers breathed a sigh of relief after Irma changed its direction in the eleventh-hour and eased worries about widespread destruction in the Sunshine State. Residents of Florida had fled to safety as the hurricane was anticipated to hit with record-breaking winds of 185 miles an hour. The 400-mile-wide hurricane was devastating enough to affect the entire state (read more: Hurricane Irma Set to Hit Florida: Gainers & Losers).Irma, however, gradually lost strength once it made landfall on the Florida Keys on Sep 10. The eye of the storm missed Miami and lost steam once it crossed the mostly uninhabited Everglades. Following this, Irma was downgraded to a tropical storm. Chief investment officer of Atlantic Trust, David Donabedian said that “it was a relief rally”, while AIR Worldwide, a catastrophe modeling software firm added that expected losses stemming from Irma is between $20 billion and $40 billion, way below their initial forecast of $20-$65 billion.New Technologies & Business Models Bode Well for InsurersMajority of U.S. insurance company CEOs that participated in the KPMG U.S. CEO Outlook 2017 are confident about the prospects of their firms in the next three years. They believe that innovative processes and implementation of new technologies in response to various disruptions will bode well for the industry.The insurance industry is optimizing the use of data analytics and predictive technologies, building data collection capabilities and uplifting the skill of the current workforce. At the same time, many insurance companies are investing in cybersecurity to find new revenue streams and innovate. Matt McCorry, Insurance Advisory Leader, KPMG LLP believes that “as insurers embark on a digital journey, cybersecurity is becoming increasingly more important to secure ongoing operations.”4 Must-Buy Insurance Stocks to Boost Your PortfolioGiven such positive trends, investing in fundamentally solid insurance stocks seems judicious.

516,AIG,"Microsoft Corp. (MSFT  -  Free Report) is fast gaining traction in blockchain technology. The company has made impressive progress in recent times through its deal with Accenture Plc (ACN  -  Free Report) and the launch of Coco Framework for making blockchain-based systems faster and secure.Microsoft is now bringing the technology mainstream for the financial industry. The company is reportedly collaborating with an Israeli lender, Bank Hapoalim for blockchain technology based digital bank guarantees.Bank guarantees are a declaration of assurance from a bank that a debtor’s liabilities will be met if an obligation is not fulfilled. Notably, this combination of blockchain with bank guarantee will be the first of its kind in the Israel banking sector. This application, once deployed, will not require clients to visit the bank physically. The documentation process will be less time consuming and secure.Microsoft’s Azure will be used for the service delivery, which is anticipated to bode well for further penetration of the cloud platform. We believe that increased adoption of the company’s new technologies coupled with growth of Azure will help the stock rebound going forward.Shares of Microsoft have gained 21.1% year to date, underperforming the industry’s 27% rally.Blockchain Players: IBM and MicrosoftBlockchain technology has been in the industry since the commencement of cryptocurrency transaction. The technology, which was previously just related to bitcoins, has become popular due to the fact that it cannot be breached. The technology ensures unadulterated data storage and transfer via a shared database or ledger and aims at putting a check on cybercrime related losses.Per MarketsandMarkets, the blockchain market is estimated to reach $2.31 billion by 2021 from $210.2 million in 2016 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 61.5%.Microsoft Corporation Revenue (TTM) Microsoft Corporation Revenue (TTM) | Microsoft Corporation QuoteThe blockchain market is currently dominated by International Business Machines Corp. (IBM  -  Free Report). Like Microsoft, the company has bank guarantee deals with Westpac and ANZ. IBM has also partnered with American International Group (AIG  -  Free Report) and Standard Chartered PLC for a multinational insurance policy using the technology.Notably, Microsoft’s blockchain technology is based on Ethereum, developed by the Ethereum Foundation while IBM supports Hyperledger. The difference from consumer point of view is that Microsoft is not a member of the Ethereum Foundation while IBM is a key member of the committee behind Hyperledger. Thus, IBM will play a role in any change of the respective infrastructure but Microsoft will not be notified of any in advance.However, the advancements that Microsoft has already made in the field are testament to the fact that it has gained the confidence of a large part of blockchain customers, and this recent deal with Bank Hapoalim is anticipated to boost the company’s top line in the near term.Zacks RankMicrosoft currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

517,AIG,"More than a month has gone by since the last earnings report for American International Group, Inc. (AIG  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 11.6% in the past month, underperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.AIG Q2 Earnings BeatAmerican International Group Inc. reported second-quarter 2017 operating income of $1.53 per share that surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a good 27.5%. Earnings were up 33% year over year.    Better-than-expected earnings were driven by strong performance by the company’s consumer business, partially offset by losses incurred by its commercial business. Also, cost-control efforts and shares bought back during the quarter aided the bottom line.The company is getting along well with its expense reduction program (taken up in Jan 2016 to reduce cost base by $1.4 billion by the end of 2017) as evident by a 15.6% decline in general operating and other expenses (GOE) to $2.2 billion.Quarterly Segment HighlightsCommercial InsuranceNet premiums written were down 15% (or 9% on a constant dollar basis) year over year to $3.8 billion due to strategic portfolio actions and an unfavorable market.Combined ratio of 102.7% deteriorated 440 basis points year over year, primarily due to an increase in loss ratio.The segment’s pre-tax operating income of $716 million increased 24% year over year.Consumer InsurancePremium and fees of $3.9 billion remained unchanged year over year. Operating revenues declined 2% year over year to 696 million, due to a decline in revenues from Group Retirement and Individual Retirement sub-segments partly offset by growth in the Life Insurance sub-segment.Pre-tax operating income increased 33% year over year to $1.3 billion, primarily driven by a decline in benefits and expenses.Financial PositionAt the end of the second quarter, the insurer’s adjusted book value per share (excluding AOCI) was $76.12, up 0.9% year over year.Core adjusted return on equity (ROE) was 10.5%, up 90 basis points year over year. The improvement in return came on the back of active capital management and expense efficiencies.In the second quarter, AIG spent $2.4 billion on share repurchase.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then? In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates. There has been one revision higher for the current quarter.American International Group, Inc. Price and Consensus  American International Group, Inc. Price and Consensus | American International Group, Inc. QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, American International's stock has a poor Growth Score of F, however its Momentum is doing a lot better with an B. However, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Our style scores indicate that the stock is more suitable for momentum investors than value investors.OutlookWhile estimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock, the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Interestingly, the stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We are looking for an inline return from the stock in the next few months.

518,AIG,"The stock of American International Group Inc. (AIG  -  Free Report) seems to be in rough waters. The company is struggling with property and casualty market challenges that are dragging down revenues of one of its most important segment — Commercial Insurance.Other macro factors such as low interest rates, currency exchange rates, credit and equity market conditions, catastrophic claims events are also acting as dampeners.Whats dragging down the stockAIG’s top line has suffered over the years from declining premium due to disciplined underwriting, competitive market conditions and reduction in business due to numerous divestitures taken.This is evident from shrinking revenues since 2010 (except in 2012) that continued till the first half of 2017. The company is unlikely to see any respite in the coming quarters as a highly competitive property and casualty market, and continued business dispositions will keep the top line under pressure.AIG is aggressively looking to mend its commercial lines business but has also confessed to a tough market environment, which may require axing of some lines that fail to meet profitability targets. This will lead to forgone business which will further compress top-line growth.The company became a victim of its own mammoth size with numerous unrelated business under its umbrella that created very little or no synergy. Many of its low return-generating business lines along with an ailing industry dragged down results to such an extent that it led activist investor Carl Icahn to call for rapid reforms at the company.Icahn demanded the sale of non-core parts of the company and reduction of its size to a manageable level. Management therefore took a number of steps aimed at rightsizing operations by cutting workforce, divesting units, reducing expense, making leadership changes, and returning funds to shareholders through share buyback and dividend payments.Though these measures helped in cutting costs and returning capital to share holders, the company was unable to address revenue-growth challenges in Commercial Insurance.Share Price Performance Year to date, shares of AIG have lost 7.1%, significantly underperforming the industry’s gain of 10.7%. Even the recent second-quarter results which came in better than expected (beating the estimates by 27.5%) offered no help to the stock, which has lost 7.9% since the earnings release compared with the decline of 5.5% endured by the industry.The company’s shares must have taken a beating due to the discontinuance of guidance and management targets. The absence of forward guidance or targets has cast doubts over the company’s future profitability. Management, however, disclosed a shift in its capital utilization strategy. It will now utilize capital for possible acquisitions in international markets, personal and life lines, and domestic middle market as opposed to significant capital used for share repurchases till now.Though the acquisitions to be made by the company will expand its business, these may not be accretive to earnings immediately. On the other hand, the bottom line will be bereft of support provided by significant buybacks till now. This will likely drain earnings in the coming quarters.Though the company has undertaken massive turnaround initiatives and has changed its leadership in the hope that the new management will bring stability, investors will remain skeptical for some time before these actions are reflected in its financials. Till then, the stock is expected to remain under pressure.AIG carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked players in the space are Atlas Financial Holdings, Inc. (AFH  -  Free Report), Markel Corporation (MKL  -  Free Report) and Mercury General Corporation (MCY  -  Free Report). Each of these stocks carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Earnings were up 33% year over year.Better-than-expected earnings were driven by strong performance by the company’s consumer business, partially offset by losses incurred by its commercial business. Also, cost-control efforts and shares bought back during the quarter aided the bottom line.The company is getting along well with its expense reduction program (taken up in Jan 2016 to reduce cost base by $1.4 billion by the end of 2017) as evident by a 15.6% decline in general operating and other expenses (GOE) to $2.2 billion.Quarterly Segment HighlightsCommercial InsuranceNet premiums written were down 15% (or 9% on a constant dollar basis) year over year to $3.8 billion due to strategic portfolio actions and an unfavorable market.Combined ratio of 102.7% deteriorated 440 basis points year over year, primarily due to an increase in loss ratio.The segment’s pre-tax operating income of $716 million increased 24% year over year.Consumer InsurancePremium and fees of $3.9 billion remained unchanged year over year.

522,AIG,"The second-quarter earnings season is in top gear with 57.2% members of the elite S&P 500 Index having reported solid quarterly numbers so far. Per the latest Earnings Preview, the performance of 286 index members (accounting for 68.8% of the index’s total market capitalization), having already reported their financial numbers this quarter, indicates that total earnings have increased 11.3% on 6.1% higher revenues. The beat ratio is impressive with 74.5% companies surpassing the bottom-line expectations and 69.2%, outperforming on the top-line front.The Finance sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors) has delivered a strong performance till now. About 70.5% companies on the S&P 500 Index that have reported quarterly results, shows 7.6% earnings growth on 5.1% increase in revenues, both on a year-over-year basis. The beat ratio of 79.1% for the bottom line compared favorably with that of the S&P 500. However, the beat ratio of 68.7% for the top line is lower than the same of S&P 500.  The second quarter witnessed several catastrophe losses, which are likely to weigh on underwriting results as well as the bottom line of insurers. Per Aon Benfield, the global reinsurance intermediary and capital advisor of Aon plc (AON  -  Free Report), the estimated amount of catastrophe losses suffered globally is $53 billion in the first half of 2017. A few insurers are anticipated to have incurred losses due to natural calamities in the second quarter, stemming from severe wind and hail catastrophe events, occurred during April and May in the U.S.Nonetheless, prudent underwriting standards should have helped the insurers guard against capital reserve erosion, piled up on a benign catastrophe environment.    Net investment income, a major component of an insurer’s top line, has witnessed improvement; albeit far lower than the historical highs. The Federal Reserve has been increasing the interest rates, reflecting confidence in the developing economic conditions. In fact, the Fed has raised interest rates thrice in three quarters. A better rate environment not only increased net investment income but has also improved investment yields.Higher rates should offer some respite to life insurers which suffered spread compression on products like fixed annuities and universal life due to continuous low rates. Annuity sales should have also benefited from higher rates. However, life insurers have considerably lowered their exposure to interest-sensitive product lines.Notably, an improving economy means more disposable income and a better consumer sentiment. This in turn might have also supported more policy writings, driving the premiums higher to generate a lion’s share in an insurers’ top line. Besides, core business growth, geographic expansion, strategic buyouts and prudent capital deployment via share repurchase have probably boosted the insurers.On the flip side, we do not expect pricings to have been strong. To write new business and retain renewals, insurers have been ironing out the creases of pricing pressure. Commercial property, workers’ compensation and general liability were mostly experiencing soft pricing.Let’s find out where the following insurers stand before their release of quarterly numbers on Aug 2.American International Group Inc. (AIG  -  Free Report) is engaged in a range of global insurance and insurance-related activities through its subsidiaries. Last quarter, AIG substantially beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 22.52%. The company’s Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and an Earnings ESP of -0.83% leave our earnings surprise prediction inconclusive. The Most Accurate estimate is pegged at $1.19 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at $1.20. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Per our proven model, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 for an earnings beat. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.We expect performance at its Commercial Lines segment to remain stressed. Individual Retirement business too has remained low due to uncertainty stemming from the Department Of Labor’s fiduciary rule and lower fixed annuity sales limiting the sales improvement. Sales growth has likely improved in Life Insurance business. Expenses too have possibly moderated.

Last quarter, Cincinnati Financial beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 9.26%. The company’s Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) with an Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult. Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 46 cents per share.We caution against the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into an earnings announcement.Cincinnati Financial is likely to report higher catastrophe losses in the soon-to-be-reported quarter, which in turn will render volatility to the company’s earnings. The company has possibly recorded an increase in total benefits and expenses. However, the company may also display investment income growth in the second quarter, backed by an increase in both interest and dividend income.

The Most Accurate estimate is pegged at $1.72 per share, whereas the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at $1.73 per share.Life insurance business is expected to see top-line growth from a change in sales mix to fight the low interest rate environment. We also expect to see an increase in total annuity sales driven by product enhancements. Margins will get an extra cushion from disciplined expense management.

Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at $1.28 per share.Low interest rates and strong equity markets likely have induced derivate losses. We anticipate the company’s Property and Casualty (P&C) segment to suffer from the underperforming auto insurance business. We also expect to see an increase in variable investment income, driven by a favorable hedge fund performance and strong private equity.

Strong account value growth is expected to have favored the company’s performance in the U.S. Retirement Solutions and Investment Management segment.

523,AIG,"American International Group, Inc. (AIG  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 2, after market close.Helped by a reduction in operating costs, AIG surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate last quarter by 22.5%. Results reflected strong operating performance at both its Consumer and Commercial Insurance segments, favorable alternative investment return and lower-than-expected catastrophe losses.The company, however, does not have an impressive surprise history. Although it beat estimates in two of the last four quarters and missed in two, it witnessed an average negative surprise of 4.85%. This is depicted in the graph below:American International Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise American International Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | American International Group, Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Q2 FlashbackWe expect performance at its Commercial Lines segment to remain stressed. Net premium written in the segment decreased 25% in 2016 and the decline continued in the first quarter. Given that the company has exited some of its casualty lines business, we expect the top line to remain under pressure over the coming quarters. The effect of the same will be seen in the to-be reported quarter.The company’s Individual Retirement business is weighed down by uncertainty stemming from the Department Of Labor’s fiduciary rule and lower fixed annuity sales due to the prevailing low interest rate environment. This resulted in lower sales in the past several quarters. Though the company has undertaken remedial measures such as making changes to product pricing, product features and asset quality, we don’t expect much improvement in sales in the upcoming release.In its Life Insurance business, recently, the company introduced a new administrative platform and digital capabilities, revamped its product suite, and substantially exited its U.S. life career distribution channel, service agent channel, and subscale group benefits business. These steps were undertaken to enhance ROE from this line of business. The efforts paid off as evident by an increase in life insurance sales in the first quarter as we expect to see further sales growth in the second quarter.Management’s efforts toward saving costs will accrue to its bottom line. In 2016, the company was ahead of its expense reduction target of $1.4 billion and decreased the same by over $1 billion or 10%. In the first quarter, its general operating and other expenses declined 18.6%. We expect to see a moderation in expenses in the to-be reported quarter.The company is also aggressively buying back shares in sync with its capital return target of $25 billion. In the first quarter, the company committed $7 billion of capital for share buyback and dividend for rest of the year. We believe substantial repurchase of shares will aid the company’s bottom line.We also expect to see an improvement in return on equity driven by the company’s continued active capital management and operating improvement.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that AIG is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: AIG has an Earning ESP of -0.83%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of $1.19 per share is a penny below the Zacks Consensus Estimate. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: AIG carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

524,AIG,"Q1 Earnings Season Coming to an End
"
525,AIG,"The Q1 earnings season is effectively over, though reports from a few companies are still awaited. It’s been an ‘average’ earnings season, with some aspects that fall in the ‘below-average’ category. But overall, the Q1 earnings season has turned out to be not materially different from what we have been seeing over the last few quarters.
"
526,AIG,"As of Friday, May 24th, we have Q1 results from 489 S&P 500 companies. Total earnings for these companies are up +2.8%, with 65.2% of companies beating earnings expectations. Revenues are down -1%, with only 41.9% of the companies coming ahead of top-line expectations. The median surprise is a respectable +2.8% for earnings and a very weak negative -0.4% for revenues.
"
527,AIG,"The Q1 earnings growth rate and ‘beat ratio’ is comparable to the last few quarters. But the revenue growth rate is lower, with the beat ratio particularly weak in the current period. The composite growth rate for Q1, where we combine the results of the 489 companies that are out with the 11 still to come, is for a rise of +2.4% in total earnings on -1.1% lower revenues.
"
528,AIG,"The predominantly negative tone of company guidance has prompted downward adjustments to estimates for the second quarter 2013, though estimates for the second half of the year have held up quite well. Total earnings in the second quarter are now expected to be up +1%, which is down from +4.8% in mid-March. As a result, the expected total earnings growth for this year has come down to +6% from 6.7% at the start of the Q1 earnings season. Consensus expectations reflect total earnings to increase an additional +11.5% in 2014.
"
529,AIG,"Recent economic data from home and abroad will likely prompt a reassessment of these consensus expectations. But the big question is with respect to how the market would react to this expected downward adjustment to earnings expectations. It has essentially shrugged such revisions thus far, banking instead on the continued Fed support to keep the rally in place. With recent developments on the Fed front indicating that the central bank could be moving towards a ‘tapering’ decision in the not-too-distant future, the underwhelming earnings picture may finally start getting more attention.Key Points

"
533,AIG,"The composite growth rate for Q1, combining the 489 reports that have come out with the 11 still to come, is for +2.4% earnings growth on -1.1% lower revenues and modestly higher margins.

"
535,AIG,"Net margins are only modestly up in Q1, but start expanding from the third quarter onwards. For the full year 2013, net margins are expected to top the 2006 peak and expand even more in 2014.
"
536,AIG,"Total earnings are expected to increase by +6% in 2013 and +11.5% in 2014. In dollar terms, earnings are expected to total $1.02 trillion in 2013 and $1.14 trillion in 2014, up from the 2012 total of $965 billion.
"
537,AIG,"The bottom-up ‘EPS’ for the S&P 500 for 2013 and 2014 currently stands at $108.95 and $121.39, respectively. The top-down ‘EPS’ estimates for 2013 and 2014 currently stand at $107.83 and $114.80.

551,AIG,"Total earnings are expected to increase by +6% in 2013 and +11.5% in 2014. In dollar terms, earnings are expected to total $1.02 trillion in 2013 and $1.14 trillion in 2014, up from the 2012 total of $965 billion.

"
554,AIG,"The year 2013 started off much better than expected for the U.S. insurance industry, with most of the primary insurers beating first quarter earnings estimates and reporting relatively low combined ratios. Moreover, the sector continued to witness rising premium rates which started a year back after a long period of softness.
"
555,AIG,"The sector seems to be reaching a favorable pricing cycle and its near-term outlook for pricing power remains upbeat in the wake of rising demand from economically recovering American households. But a dearth of positive catalysts is delaying the recovery process of the insurers. Among the fundamental challenges, weak underwriting gains and low investment yields stand out.
"
556,AIG,"Climate change further adds to the concerns. The ravages of Superstorm Sandy resulted in billions of insured losses last year. Notably, insured property losses due to Sandy were much higher than the average over the last decade.
"
557,AIG,"Though insurers are preparing themselves better to withstand significant losses, an increasing probability of natural catastrophes due to growing global warming will continue to raise concerns. This is without mentioning the tornado devastation in Moore, Oklahoma this week, which, although nowhere near as concentrated as the East Coast, will nonetheless result in further losses for insurers.
"
558,AIG,"The events outside the country such as continued debt crisis in the Eurozone will further limit the industry’s growth prospects.
"
559,AIG,"However, the overall health of the industry has improved somewhat in the recent past riding on an economic recovery, after enduring pricing pressures and reduced insured exposure since the latest recession.
"
560,AIG,"Rising premium rates should ultimately translate into margin expansion and mitigate the negative impact of the ongoing low interest rate environment on insurers’ investment income. Further, increasing awareness on the risk of catastrophe, strong underwriting discipline and favorable reserve development in the recent quarters should place the industry at least one step ahead.
"
561,AIG,"That said, though the market condition doesn’t remain soft anymore, reasonable hardening is not expected at least until the end of 2013. Moreover, a stressed balance sheet, lack of real employment growth and legislative challenges are threatening insurers’ ability to rebound to the historical growth rate.
"
562,AIG,"Also, limited organic growth opportunities and strict regulatory capital requirements will push the industry more toward consolidation. Insurers are seeking structural economies of scale through mergers and acquisitions to enhance market share. While this will help insurers stay afloat, inter-segment competition will alleviate. So, increasing profitability after complying with the regulatory requirements and coping with the challenges of climate change could prove difficult.Zacks Industry Rank
"
563,AIG,"Within the Zacks Industry classification, insurers are broadly grouped in the Finance sector (one of 16 Zacks sectors) and are further sub-divided into five industries at the expanded level: Insurance-Accident & Health, Insurance-Brokers, Insurance-Life, Insurance-Multiline and Insurance-Property & Casualty. The level of sensitivity and exposure to different stages of the economic cycle vary for each industry.
"
564,AIG,"We rank all the 260 plus industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each industry. To learn more visit: About Zacks Industry Rank.
"
565,AIG,"As a guideline, the outlook for industries with Zacks Industry Rank of #88 and lower is 'Positive,' between #89 and #176 is 'Neutral' and #177 and higher is 'Negative.'
"
566,AIG,"The Zacks Industry Rank for Insurance-Property & Casualty is #6, Insurance-Multiline is #13, Insurance-Accident & Health is #50, Insurance-Brokers is #60 and Insurance-Life is #71. Looking at the Zacks Industry Rank of the five insurance industries, one could certainly say that the near-term outlook for the group is 'Positive.'Life Insurers
"
567,AIG,"A reduction in underwriting expenses and a modest increase in premiums have been helping life insurers increase net income in the last few quarters. But downward pressure on investment yields due to a low interest rates, higher hedging costs, lower income from the variable annuity business and more burdensome capital requirements will continue to mar profitability going forward. Also, low rates are spoiling life insurers’ efforts to grow fixed annuities and universal life insurance sales.
"
568,AIG,"As the Federal Reserve plans to hold interest rates at low levels through mid-2015, life insurers will have to seek alternative asset classes to optimize return from investments. However, the addition of any risky asset class in their investment portfolios with hopes of better yield may lead to further losses.
"
569,AIG,"As the industry’s statutory capital level fell sharply during the recession, life insurers will need to optimize their capital levels to address the ensuing challenges. In the short term, traditional sources of capital are expected to fulfill most of what life insurers need in order to stay in good shape. However, non-traditional sources of capital will take years to strengthen financials.
"
570,AIG,"The underlying trends amid a recovering economy indicate stability in the sector over the medium term with respect to credit profile and financial prospects. However, higher-than-average asset losses, primarily resulting from their real estate exposure, will remain a major concern.
"
571,AIG,"Further, the sluggish pace of economic recovery is making it difficult for life insurers to expand their customer base. In fact, insurers are struggling to even retain their existing clientele. Narrowed disposable income owing to high unemployment and huge credit card debt has made it difficult for Americans to invest in retirement products such as life insurance. Americans, primarily the youth, have significantly reduced expenditures on life insurance products, and are instead choosing alternative investments that promise better returns.
"
572,AIG,"Though the carriers are transforming their products and businesses to make them attractive and profitable for customers, significant improvement in demand is not expected in the near term.
"
573,AIG,"In December, Fitch Ratings has affirmed the credit outlook for the U.S. life insurance industry at stable for 2013. This action was primarily based on the expectation of insurers’ improved liquidity and balance sheet strength.
"
574,AIG,"However, the rating agency expects statutory capital growth to be moderate in 2013 given subdued earnings growth due to the low interest rate environment. Also, the agency does not expect a significant improvement in portfolio credit quality due to the expected weakness in investment income.
"
575,AIG,"Currently, the life insurers with favorable Zacks Ranks worth considering include Protective Life Corporation (PL) and StanCorp Financial Group Inc. (SFG) with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), and China Life Insurance Co. Ltd. (LFC  -  Free Report) with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).
"
576,AIG,"Health Insurers
"
577,AIG,"As U.S. health insurers are preparing themselves to comply with the mandates of the health care reform, their financials are expected to remain strong. Broad-based moderation in utilization has been primarily boosting the bottom line of health insurers. Also, increased access to capital and better retention opportunities are helping them grow consistently despite tardy economic growth.
"
578,AIG,"Moreover, the carriers have been witnessing better credit quality in the recent quarters, reflecting a moderate industry risk.
"
579,AIG,"In 2010, the historic health care reform legislation – The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) – was passed by the Congress with the intension of making health care facilities more affordable, preventing private health insurers from continuing with the pre-existing condition clause and at the same time reducing the number of uninsured by bringing in 32 million more people under coverage by 2019.
"
580,AIG,"The legislation had many detractors who contested several of its stated benefits and considered it another entitlement program that the country can ill afford. Finally, in Jun 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of the reform, rejuvenating the industry by removing major uncertainties. Further, Obama's re-election in Nov 2012 essentially ensured a future to the law.
"
581,AIG,"While the legislative overhaul brings more regulatory scrutiny for private insurers such as WellPoint Inc. (WLP) and UnitedHealth Group, Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report), the net negative effect is expected to be far softer than was initially feared.
"
582,AIG,"Although the full implementation of PPACA will be in 2014, the industry is expected to see gradual changes through the reminder of 2013. While bringing more people under coverage will add prospects for growth, the requirement to reduce health care costs will lead to margin compression.
"
583,AIG,"Also, while the reform will provide more cross-selling opportunities for health insurers, their overall profitability will be limited over the long run as the negative impact of Medicare Advantage payment cuts, industry taxes and restrictions on underwriting practices will more than offset the benefits of bringing more people under the umbrella.
"
584,AIG,"Consequently, substantial growth in industry revenue is not expected until 2015 as insurers will be forced to adjust the benefits to comply with the health care legislation. Among others, providing coverage to everyone regardless of an expensive pre-existing condition would put their top lines at stake.
"
585,AIG,"(Want to know more about the future prospects of health insurers? Read our Health Insurance Stock Outlook)Property & Casualty Insurers
"
586,AIG,"Market hardening has been the key to improvement for property-casualty insurers in the recent quarters. After struggling with falling prices for years, insurers seem to finally reach a period of better premium rates. However, property-casualty insurers are still feeling the pressure on their investment portfolios due to the prevailing low interest rate environment. This has been continuously reducing the capital adequacy of most carriers.
"
587,AIG,"Along with continually improving pricing power, better preparation to withstand catastrophe-related losses should help insurers perform better in the upcoming quarters despite the pressure on investment income.
"
588,AIG,"As property-casualty insurers hold about two-thirds of the invested assets in the form of bonds, their capacity is highly sensitive to changes in credit market conditions. And with credit markets remaining weak plus bond prices hovering at low levels due to persisting concerns over defaults, insurers may incur significant realized and unrealized capital losses on their portfolios in the upcoming quarters. Moreover, catastrophe losses continue to keep the balance sheets of a number of carriers under pressure.
"
589,AIG,"However, the ongoing recovery in the credit and equity markets is leading to a reduction in unrealized investment losses. Also, once the economic recovery gains momentum, insurance volume will grow rapidly. With growing employment in the private sector and recovery in the housing markets, a number of carriers have already started seeing growth in insurance sales.
"
590,AIG,"The recent quarters have been increasingly witnessing a rebound in claims-paying capacity (as measured by policyholders’ surpluses), which reflects the industry’s resilience over the prior years. Conservative investment strategies and capital restructuring efforts will continue to help property-casualty insurers improve their financial footing in the upcoming quarters.
"
591,AIG,"Currently, ProAssurance Corporation (PRA  -  Free Report), XL Group plc (XL  -  Free Report), Hilltop Holdings Inc. (HTH) and AXIS Capital Holdings Limited (AXS) with a Zacks Rank #1 are worth a look in the property-casualty industry.OPPORTUNITIES
"
592,AIG,"The industry has been undertaking several structural changes that will make underwriting and pricing schemes even more attractive to consumers. Also, improving financial fundamentals on the back of favorable macroeconomic trends make the stocks of a number of industry participants appear attractive.
"
593,AIG,"We remain positive on Alleghany Corporation (Y  -  Free Report), American Safety Insurance Holdings Ltd. (ASI), White Mountains Insurance Group, Ltd. (WTM  -  Free Report), Assured Guaranty Ltd. (AGO) and Eastern Insurance Holdings, Inc. (EIHI) with a Zacks Rank #1.
"
594,AIG,"Other insurers that we like with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) include The Chubb Corporation (CB), Cincinnati Financial Corp. (CINF), Everest Re Group Ltd. (RE  -  Free Report), PartnerRe Ltd. (PRE), American International Group, Inc. (AIG), Cigna Corp. (CI), The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. (HIG), MetLife, Inc. (MET  -  Free Report), Prudential Financial, Inc. (PRU  -  Free Report) and Amerisafe, Inc. (AMSF).WEAKNESSES
"
595,AIG,"We expect continued pressure on investment yield and lower income from the variable annuity business to restrict the earnings growth rate of life insurers. Also, reduced financial flexibility and weak underwriting will hurt the earnings of many property-casualty insurers. Moreover, the overall industry is vulnerable to the ever-increasing threat of natural disasters.
"
596,AIG,"Among the Zacks covered U.S. insurers, we prefer to stay away from the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stocks: ING Groep NV (ING  -  Free Report), AFLAC Inc. (AFL), Loews Corporation (L  -  Free Report), Meadowbrook Insurance Group Inc. (MIG) and Stewart Information Services Corporation (STC  -  Free Report). Currently, there are no stocks with a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).

"
598,AIG,"With more than 90% of the market capitalization of the S&P 500 already out with Q1 earnings results, the reporting season is getting into its final stretch. In fact, the earnings season has ended for 9 of the 16 Zacks sectors, including Finance, Energy, Basic Materials and others. As is typically the case each earnings season, most of the remaining companies are in the Retail sector.   
"
599,AIG,"It’s been an ‘average’ earnings season, with some aspects that fall in the ‘below-average’ category. But overall, the Q1 earnings season has turned out to be not materially different from what we have been seeing over the last few earnings seasons.
"
600,AIG,"Including the earnings releases after the market close on Thursday, May 9th, we have Q1 results from 453 S&P 500 companies. Total earnings for these 453 companies that have reported results already are up +3.3%, with 65.3% of the companies beating earnings expectations. Revenues are down -0.9%, with only 41.1% of the companies coming ahead of top-line expectations. The median surprise is a respectable +3.2% for earnings and negative -0.4% for revenues.
"
601,AIG,"The earnings growth rate and ‘beat ratio’ (% of companies coming out with positive surprises) for these 453 companies is comparable what these same companies reported in 2012 Q4 and the last few quarters. But the revenue growth rate is lower, with the beat ratio particularly weak in the current period.
"
602,AIG,"The composite growth rate for Q1, where we combine the results of the 453 companies that are out with the 47 still to come, is for a rise of +2.4% in total earnings on -0.8% lower revenues. This is better performance than what was expected ahead of the earnings season when total earnings growth was expected to be in the negative.
"
603,AIG,"The predominantly negative tone of company guidance has prompted downward adjustments to estimates for the second quarter 2013, but estimates for the second half of the year have held up quite well. Total earnings in the second quarter are now expected to be up +1.4%, which is down from +4.8% in mid-March. As such, consensus expectations are for first half 2013 total earnings growth of +1.9% to be followed by +9.6% growth in total earnings in the back half, which flows through into 2014 (+11.4%).    
"
604,AIG,"Recent economic data from home and abroad will likely prompt a reassessment of these consensus expectations. But the big question is with respect to how the market would react to this expected downward adjustment to earnings expectations. It has essentially shrugged such revisions thus far, but we will have to wait and see what happens in the coming days.Key Points
"
605,AIG,"Total earnings for the 453 S&P members that have already reported first-quarter 2013  results are up +3.3%, with 65.3% of the companies beating earnings expectations. Total revenues are down -0.9%, with only 41.1% of the companies coming ahead of revenue expectations.

"
609,AIG,"Unlike the last many quarters, Finance is a drag on growth this quarter, with tough comparisons at Bank of America ((BAC  -  Free Report)) and AIG ((AIG  -  Free Report)) accounting for most of the sector’s earnings weakness.
"
610,AIG,"There hasn’t been much earnings growth in recent quarters, but the absolute level of quarterly earnings is expected to have bottomed in 2012 Q4 and start going up from 2013 Q1 onwards.

"
631,AIG,"It is still early going for the 2013 Q1 earnings season, with results from only 34 S&P 500 members thus far. No clear trends have emerged yet, but we will have seen results from 1/5th of the index’s total membership by the end of this week and should be in in a better position to evaluate this earnings season.  
"
632,AIG,"Total earnings for these 34 companies are up +16% from the same period last year, with 64.7% of them beating earnings expectations. Total revenues for these companies are up +5.5% and 41.2% of them have come out with positive top-line surprises. This is better than pre-season expectations, but is weaker than what these same companies reported in the preceding quarter.  
"
633,AIG,"Earnings at the three universal banks – J.P. Morgan (JPM  -  Free Report), Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report), and Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) - came in better than expected Growth. But they were less than ‘pure’ given the outsized contributions from reserve releases, particularly at J.P. Morgan and Wells Fargo. The deceleration in the mortgage business, continued net interest margins pressures and weak loan demand provide a less than inspiring read through for the rest of the banking group. On the positive side, momentum in the capital markets business bodes well for investment banks, particularly Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report). Total Finance sector earnings in Q1 after including the results from the three universal banks are now for growth of +0.8%, which is an improvement from where expectations stood last week.  
"
634,AIG,"Total earnings for the S&P 500 as a whole are expected to down -1.8% from the same period last year, reflecting -0.6% decline in revenues and modest contraction in margins. The mediocre growth picture is a reflection of tough comparisons and underwhelming management guidance – the first quarter of 2012 remains the high point of total quarterly earnings since the current earnings cycle got underway in 2009.  
"
635,AIG,"But lack of growth in the first quarter is not much of a concern for the market, as investors are looking ahead to period of robust growth later in the year, particularly in the back half of 2013 and all of 2014. The expectation is that the +0.9% earnings growth in the first half of 2013 will be followed by double-digit earnings growth in the second half of the year and into next year. Driving these optimistic growth expectations are strong revenue gains and further expansion in margins which are already in record territory.  
"
636,AIG,"Revenue growth is a function of economic growth. And while GDP growth has been fairly erratic in recent quarters, the expectation is for a sustained period of growth starting in the second half of the year. Hard to tell how reasonable the revenue growth expectations are since they are so closely tied to the uncertain economic backdrop.  
"
637,AIG,"But margins are a different story. Expecting margins to continue expanding after they have crossed the prior cyclical peak does not seem reasonable or plausible.Key Points
"
638,AIG,"The first-quarter 2013 reporting season has gotten underway. The 34 companies that have reported results present a mixed picture, with a few high-profile negative surprises.
"
639,AIG,"Total Q1 earnings are expected to be down -1.8% from the same period last year, which reflects -0.6% drop in revenues and a modest contraction in margins.
"
640,AIG,"Tough comparisons and weak management guidance account for the weak earnings growth picture. Total earnings reached their highest quarterly total in the first quarter of 2012 and have yet to get back to that level.
"

The outlook for Tech is even weaker and fairly widespread, which comes after the sector’s underwhelming performance in the previous quarter.  
"
652,AIG,"But lack of growth in the first quarter is not much of a concern for the market, as investors are looking ahead to period of robust growth later in the year, particularly in the back half of 2013 and all of 2014. The expectation is that the +0.7% earnings growth in the first half of 2013 will be followed by double-digit earnings growth in the second half of the year and into next year. Driving these optimistic growth expectations are strong revenue gains and further expansion in margins which are already in record territory.

"
654,AIG,"But margins are a different story. Expecting margins to continue expanding after they have crossed the prior cyclical peak does not seem reasonable or plausible.Key Points:
"
655,AIG,"The first-quarter 2013 reporting season has gotten underway. The 22 companies that have reported results present a mixed picture, with a few high-profile negative surprises.
"
656,AIG,"Total Q1 earnings are expected to be down -2.6% from the same period last year, which reflects -0.9% drop in revenues and a modest contraction in margins.
"
657,AIG,"Tough comparisons and weak management guidance account for the weak earnings growth picture. Total earnings reached their highest quarterly total in the first quarter of 2012 and have yet to get back to that level.
"
658,AIG,"Unlike the last many quarters, Finance will be a drag on growth this quarter. Tough comparisons for Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report) and AIG (AIG  -  Free Report) account for most of the earnings weakness.
"
659,AIG,"Tech earnings were weak last quarter and they are expected to be even weaker this time around. The sector’s earnings weakness is broad-based and not solely due to the negative comparisons for Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) and Intel (INTC  -  Free Report).
"
660,AIG,"There hasn’t been much earnings growth in recent quarters, but the absolute level of quarterly earnings is expected to have bottomed in 2012 Q4 and start going up from 2013 Q2 onwards. 
"
661,AIG,"Total earnings in the first half of 2013 are expected to increase by +0.7%, but ramp up to a +10.9% growth pace in the back half of the year and a further +11.7% in 2014. A combination of revenue gains and margin expansion reflect the positive outlook for the back half of the year.
"
662,AIG,"Net margins modestly contract in the first quarter, but start expanding from the second quarter onwards. For the full year 2013, net margins are expected to top the 2006 peak and expand even more in 2014.
"
663,AIG,"Total earnings are expected to increase by +6.8% in 2013 and +11.7% in 2014. In dollar terms, earnings are expected to total $1.03 trillion in 2013 and $1.15 trillion in 2014, up from the 2012 total of $965 billion.
"
664,AIG,"The bottom-up ‘EPS’ for the S&P 500 for 2013 and 2014 currently stands at $109.75 and $122.60, respectively. The top-down ‘EPS’ estimates for 2013 and 2014 currently stand at $107.83 and $114.80.

711,AIG,"The trade deficit numbers came in-line with expectations this morning and the two-day FOMC meeting gets underway today. Expectations remain high that the Fed will come out with a new bond-purchase program to replace the expiring ‘Operation Twist.’ Reassuringly, the ‘Fiscal Cliff’ negotiations are reportedly making progress, though both sides are keeping the details private at this stage.
"
712,AIG,"And Italy’s political uncertainties following the weekend resignation announcement of Mario Monti and the resulting uptrend in its bond yields do not appear to be spreading to other countries at this stage. Stocks may not do much due to the ‘Cliff’ drag, but the bias should be modestly to the upside.
"
713,AIG,"Stocks will likely shrug off today’s in-line October trade balance numbers, but the persistent deceleration in export growth should be worrisome. Not only have the export growth numbers been on a downtrend lately, but the export orders sub-index of the manufacturing ISM index has been in contracting mode (below the ‘50’ level) as well since summer. The global economic slowdown appears to be the primary driver of this trend.
"
714,AIG,"Export growth has been a key contributor to GDP growth since the start of the recovery in 2009 and its weakness means that other areas need to step up to make up for the growth shortfall. The housing recovery would have been a nice add-on to the economy’s growth trajectory, but the weakness in exports as well as in corporate capital spending means that a lot will be riding on consumer spending.
"
715,AIG,"And while consumer spending appears to be holding up nicely, we may not an improvement in the absence a noticeable uptick in the labor market. Bottom line: while everybody expects the economy to start ramping up beyond the next couple of quarters, it isn’t clear where the growth will come from.

717,AIG,"I would say a little bit of both – earnings will likely turn out on the lower side in the third quarter, but are most likely on the higher side for the fourth quarter and beyond. Expectations for the third quarter seem fair. But given management’s track record of under-promising and over-delivering and sell-side analysts’ gullibility to go along with it, we will likely see the expected decline of 3.4% to be on the low side.
"
718,AIG,"The third quarter earnings decline is broad-based, with half of the 16 Zacks sectors showing negative year-over-year comparisons, though the weakness is particularly significant in Energy (-24.9%), Basic Materials (-22.3%), and Autos (-21.9%). Among the positive growers, Finance earnings are expected to be up 15.5%, while the Construction sector will see a 42.3% earnings gain. Excluding Finance, total earnings would be down 6.7%.

Unlike what we saw in the second quarter (+4%) and is expected in the third quarter (-3.4%), the fourth quarter is expected to bring earnings growth of 7.9%. Easy comps account for part of this fourth quarter growth projection.

743,AIG,"The U.S. insurance industry sees no respite from natural catastrophe losses yet again this year. The 2012 Atlantic hurricane season, which officially started on June 1 and will run through November 30, is just a little more than half over and it appears that it is not as mild as was expected earlier. Though insurers are better prepared to withstand significant losses this time, the after effect of this year’s hurricane season will play a key role in determining the sector fundamentals for 2013.
"
744,AIG,"Insurers have yet to recover fully from the impact of last year's series of natural disasters, and the industry continues to reel under economic unrest that thwarts every attempt it makes to grow. A dearth of positive catalysts is naturally making it harder for insurers to recover fast.
"
745,AIG,"These impediments aside, there are fundamental challenges that are expected to come in the way of insurers’ efforts to meet growing investor expectations in the upcoming quarters. Among the possibilities, rising rates and pricing flexibility stand out.
"
746,AIG,"It can be said that the overall health of the U.S. insurance industry has improved to some extent in recent quarters, after enduring pricing pressures and reduced insured exposure for quite some time. The market turmoil resulting from the Great Recession of 2008-2009 forced many companies to take immense write-downs, but those are gradually becoming a thing of the past.
"
747,AIG,"That said, continued soft market conditions, shrinking businesses, a still-high unemployment rate, uncertain fiscal policy and legislative challenges are threatening insurers’ ability to rebound to the historical growth rate. The industry continues to be challenged by subdued premium volume growth in a perked-up economy as well as a massive healthcare restructuring.
"
748,AIG,"Though there are signs of economic recovery, its sluggish pace and sudden drop-offs are expected to continue at least through the first half of 2013. Also, structural economies of scale have pushed the industry toward consolidation. As a result, inter-segment competition within the industry has alleviated. Moving forward, maintaining profitability after complying with regulatory requirements and meeting the challenges of climate change could be a painful task.
"
749,AIG,"We expect static growth from persistent soft market conditions to result in further consolidation in the industry. Though there are near-term opportunities for insurers, thanks to rapidly growing sectors such as health care and technology, overall industry conditions are expected to improve beyond 2012, provided the economy turns toward growth. The industry would likely take a couple more years to overcome most industry challenges with the help of an improved market mechanism.Life Insurers
"
750,AIG,"Losses in the investment portfolios, higher hedging costs, lower income from the variable annuity business and more burdensome capital requirements will continue to restrict earnings growth of the life insurers. Most life insurers have substantial exposure to commercial real estate-backed loans and securities, which will lead to further losses in the coming quarters.
"
751,AIG,"As the industry’s statutory capital level fell sharply during the recession, life insurance companies will need to optimize their capital levels to address the ensuing challenges. In the short term, traditional sources of capital are expected to fulfill most of what life insurers need in order to stay in good shape. However, non-traditional sources of capital will take years to strengthen financials.
"
752,AIG,"Moreover, regulatory changes under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform are still troubling life insurers as they pose strategic and competitive challenges. In order to address such concerns, life insurers may have to burn some of their financial energy.
"
753,AIG,"The underlying trends amid a sluggish economic recovery indicate stability of the U.S. life insurers over the medium term with respect to credit profile and financial prospects. However, higher-than-average asset losses, primarily resulting from their real estate exposure, will remain a major concern in the near- to mid-term.
"
754,AIG,"Most importantly, the tardy economic recovery is making it difficult for life insurers to expand their customer base. In fact, insurers are struggling to even retain their existing clientele. Narrowed disposable income owing to high unemployment and huge credit card debt has made it difficult for Americans to invest in retirement products such as life insurance.
"
755,AIG,"Moreover, the low interest rate environment is one of the major risks for life insurers at this point. Investment income remains weak as life insurers are experiencing low returns on fixed-income instruments. Also, low rates are spoiling life insurers’ efforts to grow fixed annuities and universal life insurance sales.
"
756,AIG,"In mid September, credit-rating agency Moody's -- a wing of Moody's Corp. (MCO) -- has revised its outlook for the U.S. life insurance industry to negative from stable. This action was primarily based on the rating agency’s expectation of continued pressure on life insurers’ earnings due to persistently low interest rates.   
"
757,AIG,"On the other hand, interest in cheaper products to cover only basic risks has increased. So, returning to providing basic services and reducing operating costs should be the primary course of action for life insurers to realize some profit.
"
758,AIG,"Some life insurers have already gone back to the basics in order to meet demand and escape financial and regulatory difficulties, but this conservative stance will not be adequate for thriving. Life insurance companies have to be more proactive to weather the situation.Health Insurers
"
759,AIG,"The U.S. healthcare system is significantly dependent on private health insurance, which is the primary source of coverage for most Americans. More than half of the U.S. citizens are covered under private health insurers such as WellPoint Inc. (WLP) and UnitedHealth Group, Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report).
"
760,AIG,"Unfortunately, these insurance companies utilize a pre-existing condition exemption clause to control costs and maximize profit. The historic healthcare reform legislation, which was passed by Congress in 2010, aims to prevent private insurance companies from using the pre-existing condition clause and at the same time bring in 32 million more people under coverage by 2019.
"
761,AIG,"However, the legislation has had many detractors who contested several of its stated benefits and considered it another entitlement program that the country can ill afford. Finally, in June 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of the healthcare reform, rejuvenating the industry by removing major uncertainties.
"
762,AIG,"With respect to the individual mandate, which drew the most attention as it requires all uninsured Americans to purchase a minimum level of health insurance coverage, the Supreme Court ruled that individuals failing to buy health insurance will have to pay a tax fine, but forcing them to buy insurance will be illegal. Employers will also be fined if they fail to provide insurance coverage to their workers.
"
763,AIG,"While the legislative overhaul brings more regulatory scrutiny for private insurance companies, the net negative effect is far softer than was initially feared. Also, the removal of this uncertainty is a net positive in its own right.
"
764,AIG,"Though the reform will provide more cross-selling opportunities for health insurers, their overall profitability will be marred in the long run as the negative impact of Medicare Advantage payment cuts, industry taxes and restrictions on underwriting practices will more than offset the benefits of adding the extra 32 million people into the system.
"
765,AIG,"Growth in nonfarm payroll employment is expected to enhance health insurers’ customer base to some extent as these individuals will be insured through their jobs. However, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, in August 2012, nonfarm payroll employment inched up just 96,000 and the rate of unemployment marginally edged down to 8.1%.
"
766,AIG,"That said, growth in industry revenue is expected to decline until 2015 as insurers will be forced to adjust the benefits to comply with the healthcare legislation. Among others, providing coverage to everyone regardless of whether they had an expensive pre-existing condition would put their top lines at stake.Property & Casualty Insurers
"
767,AIG,"Steep losses in the investment portfolios have been continuously reducing the capital adequacy of most property-casualty insurers since the latest recession. The seizure of credit markets and rising concerns over defaults have pushed down bond prices sharply since then, causing significant realized and unrealized capital losses on these insurers’ portfolios.
"
768,AIG,"As property-casualty insurers hold about two-thirds of the invested assets in the form of bonds, their capacity is highly sensitive to changes in credit market conditions. Low interest rates and government bond yields are expected to compress profits in the quarters ahead. However, an expected improvement in casualty rates will partially offset the negatives.
"
769,AIG,"While the ongoing recovery in the credit and equity markets is leading to a reduction in unrealized investment losses, the premium rates continue to decline, though at a slower pace. This declining trend in premium rates is expected to persist through the first half of 2013, adversely affecting insurer profitability. The key positive trend visible as of now is a slight improvement in some insurance pricing after persistent deterioration for the last three years.
"
770,AIG,"On the other hand, high catastrophe losses, stiff competition and lower reinvestment yields are expected to depress profits for property-casualty insurers.
"
771,AIG,"However, the property-casualty industry endured the latest financial crisis better than the other financial service sectors. Once the economic recovery gains momentum, insurance volume will grow rapidly.
"
772,AIG,"The recent quarters have been witnessing an increasing rebound in claims-paying capacity (as measured by policyholders’ surpluses), which reflects the industry’s resilience over the prior years. Strong capital adequacy and conservative investment strategies will keep these insurers on solid financial footing in the upcoming quarters.Reinsurers
"
773,AIG,"Losses from the investment portfolios of reinsurance companies have gotten worse during the last few quarters. The deterioration resulted from the supply-demand imbalance in reinsurance coverage due to intense competition that kept pricing soft over the last few years.
"
774,AIG,"Also, catastrophic events like hurricanes Ike and Gustav were the major culprits that put underwriting profits under pressure. However, in the recent months, reinsurance prices have increased substantially. Also, reinsurers now have the capacity to meet the demand for coverage despite catastrophe losses.
"
775,AIG,"With signs of recovery in the capital markets (though still weak by any standard), concerns related to reinsurers' ability to access capital markets on reasonable terms have sufficiently eased.
"
776,AIG,"However, lesser new business and rising expense ratios are the major concerns for reinsurers at this point. An increased level of price competition may also hurt top lines in the upcoming quarters.
"
777,AIG,"Moreover, reinsurance market capital levels are expected to be down for reinsurers with huge exposure to the European sovereign debt crisis.OPPORTUNITIES
"
778,AIG,"Insurance companies are suffering from the ongoing economic uncertainty and challenges related to natural disasters. However, this tough period brings opportunities for many large industry participants to grow by attracting new customers and taking market share away from weak rivals.

"
781,AIG,"We expect continued pressure on investment portfolios and lower income from the variable annuity business to restrict the earnings growth rate of life insurers. Also, reduced financial flexibility and weak underwriting will hurt the earnings of many property-casualty insurers. Moreover, the overall industry is vulnerable to the ever-increasing threat of natural disasters.

Though the market turmoil forced many companies to take immense write-downs, the worst of the crisis appears to be now behind us.
"
784,AIG,"The soft market conditions, along with legislative changes, remain the chief causes for concern for the overall industry at this point. The industry continues to be challenged by the regulatory uncertainties and massive health care restructuring.
"
785,AIG,"Though there are signs of economic recovery, its sluggish pace is expected to continue at least through the first half of 2011. Also, structural economies of scale have pushed the industry toward consolidation. Moving forward, maintaining profitability after complying with the regulatory requirements is not expected to be a painless task.
"
786,AIG,"While enormous financial support from the government helped rescue American International Group (AIG  -  Free Report) from collapse, many other firms remain under tremendous pressure or have fallen by the wayside. Competition within the segments of the industry has reduced, which is consolidating through mergers and acquisitions. This has increased market shares of the largest firms.

"
842,AIG,"After enduring extraordinary shocks in 2008, the U.S. banks entered an exceptional state of turmoil in 2009. Starting as a credit issue in the subprime segment of the mortgage market, the situation affected about the entire financial services industry, in all corners of the globe. In other words, the financial crisis ultimately morphed into a massive economic crisis, which has had major ramifications across the whole world.
"
843,AIG,"Although the banking industry is dealing with liquidity and confidence challenges in 2010, it is now comparatively stable, with financial support from the U.S. government. The government had taken several steps, including programs offering capital injections and debt guarantees, to stabilize the financial system.
"
844,AIG,"We believe that the worst of the credit crisis is now behind us. After more than a year of initiating the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), a lot has improved with respect to the economic crisis.
"
845,AIG,"But the banking system is not yet out of the woods, as there are persistent problems that need to be addressed by the government before shifting the strategy to growth. We believe that the U.S. economy will regain its growth momentum once these issues are resolved.
"
846,AIG,"While the bigger banks benefited greatly from the various programs launched by the government, many smaller banks are still in a very weak financial state, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s (FDIC) list of problem banks continues to grow.Bank Failures Continue
"
847,AIG,"Despite the government’s strong efforts, we continue to see bank failures. Tumbling home prices, soaring loan defaults and a high unemployment rate continue to take their toll on small banks. As the industry tolerates bad loans made during the credit explosion, the trouble in the banking system goes even deeper, increasing the possibility of more bank failures.
"
848,AIG,"Furthermore, government efforts have not succeeded in restoring the lending activity at the banks. Lower lending will continue to hurt margins and the overall economy, though the low interest rate environment should be beneficial to banks with a liability-sensitive balance sheet.
"
849,AIG,"Out of the $247 billion given to the banks, more than half has come back from the healthy banks who have repaid their TARP funds in full. Banks have also paid about $11 billion in interest and dividends. Also, taxpayers have received decent returns on many of its financial-sector investments. Repayments under the TARP have generated a 17% annualized return from stock-warrant repurchases and $12 billion in dividend payments from dozens of banks.
"
850,AIG,"Many of the major banks that have already repaid the bailout money include JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report), Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report), Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report), BB&T (BBT), US Bancorp (USB  -  Free Report), Bank of America (BAC), Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) and Citigroup (C  -  Free Report).
"
851,AIG,"Following the U.S. Treasury’s appeal to the world banking system to maintain stronger capital and liquidity standards by the end of 2010 to prevent a re-run of the global financial crisis, 15 large banks that control the majority of derivative trading worldwide have committed themselves to maintaining greater transparency in the $600 trillion market, which needs stricter oversight in the interest of the global financial system.
"
852,AIG,"Moreover, in mid-January 2010, the Obama Administration proposed a tax on about 50 of the nation's largest financial firms in order to recover the losses incurred by the government on its $700 billion bailout program. On approval of Congress, the tax, which the White House calls a ""financial crisis responsibility fee,"" would force the banks to reportedly pay the federal government about $90 billion over 10 years.
"
853,AIG,"Targeting banks to recover the shortfall in bailout money can be considered justified, as they are the major beneficiaries of the taxpayers' largesse. Most of the bailout loan was provided to financial institutions, as they form the backbone of the economy and were the primary victims of the crisis.
"
854,AIG,"If the economic recovery tails off, high-risk loan defaults could re-emerge. About $500 billion in commercial real estate loans would be due annually over the next few years.
"
855,AIG,"Above all, there are lingering concerns related to the banking industry as well as the economy. Continued asset-quality troubles are expected to force many banks to record substantial additional provisions at least through the end of 2010. This will be a drag on the profitability of many banks for extended periods, which will further stretch their capital levels.
"
856,AIG,"While the economy is in a recovery phase, a lot remains to be done. The Treasury continues to hold huge direct investments in institutions like American International Group (AIG), Fannie Mae (FNM) and Freddie Mac (FRE).
"
857,AIG,"Additionally, rating agency Standard & Poor's said in March 2010 that it is maintaining its negative outlook for the U.S. banking industry based on FDIC’s industry financial performance data as of the end of 2009. The agency expects credit losses in the loan books of banks to be on the upside. Further, the agency warned that the pressure on ratings has not yet fully eased.
"
858,AIG,"In conclusion, we expect loan losses on commercial real estate portfolio to remain high for banks that hold large amounts of high-risk loans. Also, as a result of a rise in charge-offs, the levels of reserve coverage have fallen over the past quarters and the banks will have to make higher provisions at least in the near term, affecting their profitability. We think that the financial crisis is far from over, and it will be awhile before we can write the end to this crisis story.OPPORTUNITIES
"
859,AIG,"The Treasury’s requirement of focusing on banking institutions towards higher-quality capital will help banks absorb big losses. Though this would somewhat limit the profitability of banks, a proper implementation would bring stability to the overall sector and hopefully address bank failures.

"
862,AIG,"We favor Commerce Bancshares Inc. (CBSH) in this space since this company is one of the few names that did not report losses even during the current financial crisis. We believe that Commerce is one of the best-capitalized banks in the industry and will generate positive earnings throughout the credit cycle. While the bank had a decent growth in deposits in the most recent quarter, trends in its credit metrics were negative.WEAKNESSES
"
863,AIG,"The financial system is going through massive de-leveraging, and banks in particular have lowered leverage. The implication for banks is that the profitability metrics (like returns on equity and return on assets) will be lower than in recent years.
"
864,AIG,"Furthermore, the current crisis has dramatically accelerated the consolidation trend in the industry. As a result, failure of a large financial institution will be a major concern in the upcoming quarters as weaker entities are being absorbed by the larger ones.
"
865,AIG,"We think banks with high exposure to housing and Commercial Real Estate loans, like Wilmington Trust Corporation (WL), KeyCorp (KEY) and Zions Bancorp (ZION), will remain under pressure.

We have decided to start focusing our analysis of the S&P 500 based on Zacks' own sector groupings rather than the S&P GICS sectors. There are 16 Zacks sectors and only 10 GICS sectors, so the new groupings will result in better granularity of the data. The old way simply grouped too many very different companies together. In addition, we for the first time are presenting top line as well as bottom line expectations and surprise information.We use the convention of referring to the next full fiscal year to be completed as 2010, although not all firms are on December fiscal years. This can cause discontinuities in the data, particularly around this time of year. The data is based on FY1, not based on 2010, even though I may call it 2010 in the report.Earnings Season Nearly FinishedWith 99.0% (495) of the S&P 500 reports in, the year-over-year earnings growth has simply been fabulous at 105.5%. However, much of that growth is due to a single firm, AIG (AIG  -  Free Report) and its massive year-ago losses. By any normal standard, its losses were enormous this year as well, but last year was not normal. It is not like the $7.2 billion it lost in this year’s fourth quarter is chicken feed, but it is a huge improvement on the $37.9 billion it lost a year ago.AIG was, of course, not alone among the financials in reporting epic losses a year ago, but if losses are epic poems, then AIG last year was the Iliad and the Odyssey rolled into one. If just AIG is excluded, the growth rate drops to 45.2%, and if all the Financials are excluded, the growth rate is just 14.2%. Still, firms with positive EPS growth out number those with falling EPS by a ratio of 1.80:1, and 63.2% of all firms reported positive EPS growth.Even set against the expectations coming into the earnings season it has been an extremely good one. For every two earnings disappointments there have been more than nine positive surprises. In all, 72.9% of all firms reporting have come in with better than expected earnings.  Half of all the surprises (including the disappointments) have been more than 5.54%.Likewise, on the top line things are coming in both better than last year and better than expected. Total revenues are 6.07% higher than a year ago among the 495 firms that have already reported, and positive revenue surprises are beating revenue disappointments by a margin of 2.30:1. Put another way, 65.5% of all firms have reported better-than-expected revenues. Overall, 56.0% of all firms have reported higher revenues than a year ago. In the third quarter, that figure was below 30%.Large Firms' Gains Not the Whole StoryWhile the dramatic growth in earnings is largely due to turnarounds in a handful of very large firms moving from big losses a year ago to profits this year (or a much smaller loss, especially in the case of AIG), that is not the full story. Most of those big turnarounds were in the Financial sector. The Financial companies that have reported so far have earned $11.6 billion this year, while those same firms lost a total of $55.4 billion a year ago.The Financials have also been the key driver behind revenue growth for the quarter, as a year ago we had the unusual situation where some of them were reporting negative revenues. If the Financials are excluded, the year-over-year revenue growth falls to 2.12%.With or without the Financials, Earnings growth is dramatically higher than revenue growth, which means we are seeing a huge increase in net margins. That margin expansion is expected to continue, not only in 2010, but into 2011 as well. Earlier in 2009, margins were plunging. For the year as a whole, the decline in revenues is almost identical to the decline in net income.Turning our attention to the first quarter expectations, total earnings are expected to rise by 22.8%, which sounds like a big slowdown from the 105.5% rate in the 4Q. However, it the Financials are excluded, we actually see an acceleration in year-over-year earnings growth to 23.6%. The Financials are expected to be just a little below average at 21.3& growth.Autos and Construction both lost money in last year’s first quarter and are expected to be profitable this year, which means the percentage growth rates are not meaningful. Replacing the outsized gains from Finance will be extremely strong year-over-year growth from Materials, Tech, Industrials and Energy, all of which are expected to post year-over-year growth in excess of 40%.Looking at full-year earnings, total net income is expected to be lower than that of 2008, but just by 10.1%, a much smaller decline than the 23.0% plunge in 2008 (Financials are the big swing factor).  This year will be one of earnings recovery, with growth of 31.1% expected, but note that that will still leave earnings below 2007 levels. Further growth of 20.0% is expected for total earnings in 2011.Analysts See Growth Picking Up in 2011As for the top line, after a 7.4% plunge in 2009, revenues are expected to grow by 3.5% in 2010, followed by 7.4% growth in 2011. Implicitly then, the analysts are predicating an economic recovery that gains steam in 2011, rather than one that peters out or double dips. After all, the amount of revenue going through the combined hands of the 500 biggest (OK, with some exceptions) firms in the country would seem to correlate pretty well with overall economic activity.True, there is economic activity outside of the S&P 500, and not all S&P 500 revenue comes from inside the U.S. But there is nothing to suggest those shares have shifted meaningfully over the last few years or will over the next two.In 2010, the percentage growth numbers will be not really meaningful for the Auto sector. While the 2009 numbers will be positive, they are so close to break-even that big percentage gains in 2010 are not to really be taken seriously. Among the larger sectors, Materials and the Financials are expected to be the growth leaders for the year. Energy is also expected to see a large rebound in its total profits. Energy is also expected to be the leader in top ling growth. The revisions ratios for both 2010 and 2011 are strong, and should give us confidence that those growth rates will actually be achieved, if not exceeded. Every sector but Utilities, Aerospace and Construction has seen more estimates raised for 2010 than cut, and the revisions ratio for 2010 stands at an extremely strong 1.69.For 2011, the revisions ratio is at 1.66. The ratio of firms with rising mean estimates is also well above one for both years, but at 1.42 and 1.35 quite a bit lower than the revisions ratios. In other words, the positive earnings revisions are concentrated among relatively few firms.The earnings yields on the S&P 500 continue to look very attractive relative to the 10-year bond yield. A P/E ratio of 14.9x based on 2010 earnings translates into an earnings yield of 6.71% and based on 2011 earnings the S&P has a P/E ratio of 12.4x, or an earnings yield of 8.06%. That is comfortably above 2x the yield on the 10-year T-note of 3.73%. Stocks look very attractive, at least relative to bonds.Scorecard & Earnings Surprise

874,AIG,"•    Year-over-year Earnings Growth Ratio (# Positive Growth/# Negative Growth) at 1.80, big improvement over recent quarters. 63.2% report positive growthIn evaluating the data presented here, keep the percentage reported in mind. The move to the 16 Zacks sectors means that even when all reports are in, some of the sectors will still have relatively few firms in them. For firms with only a few reports in, the median surprise will be very volatile as new firms are added to the sample.With 99% of the reports in, this has been a very strong earnings season. Yes, we had easy comps from a year ago, but 105.5% year-over-year growth is nothing to sneeze at. Most of that eye-popping growth is due to a handful of firms, mostly in the financials. However, even if the Financials are excluded, earnings growth is still 14.2%. The majority of firms are reporting higher earnings than a year ago. Earnings are coming in much better than expected, with 72.9% of all firms reporting coming in with better-than-expected earnings, only 16.4% disappointing.While all sectors have seen more positive surprises than disappointments, Tech has put on an absolutely stunning performance. With all of its results in, there have been 63 positive surprises and just a single disappointment.Autos have far fewer firms, but with all of its results in, it has a perfect record, and a stunning 82.15% median surprise. Conglomerates also have a perfect record of 8 and 0. Retail, Business Service and Discretionary have hugely positive surprise ratios (10 or more). Disappointments are concentrated in the Financials, as the sector is responsible for 29.1% of all firms falling short of expectations.Scorecard & Earnings Surprise Income Surprises Yr/YrGrowth %Reported SurpriseMedian EPSSurpPos EPSSurpNeg #GrowPos #GrowNegAuto    - to + 100.00% 82.15 6 0 5 1Construction    - to + 100.00% 33.96 8 3 7 4Consumer Discretionary 13.11% 100.00% 14.42 31 2 23 13Basic Materials 266.28% 100.00% 12.87 17 5 13 10Conglomerates 5.12% 100.00% 9.94 8 0 5 4Computer and Tech 46.03% 100.00% 9.83 63 1 49 21Industrial Products -24.07% 100.00% 9.76 13 5 9 10Retail/Wholesale 20.20% 93.18% 4.46 35 3 33 7Oils and Energy -25.03% 100.00% 4.44 28 10 15 25Consumer Staples 0.15 100.00% 3.75 26 7 26 10Medical 0.02 100.00% 3.47 34 5 36 10Business Service 0.03 94.44% 3.45 10 1 9 7Finance    - to + 100.00% 3.11 46 23 55 20Transportation -0.18 100.00% 2.74 6 3 1 8Utilities -0.13 100.00% 2.72 25 8 24 17Aerospace 0.16 100.00% 1.88 5 3 3 7S&P 105.46% 99.00% 5.54 361 79 313 174Sales Surprises• Sales Surprise ratio at 2.30: median surprise 1.66%, 65.5% of all firms do better than expected on top line

This is mostly due to a handful of Financial firms that actually reported negative revenues last year. The year-ago situation was highly unusual.Excluding Financials, total revenues are up just 2.12%. However, nine of the sectors have reported higher revenues than a year ago. In distinct contrast to the third quarter, when less than one third of all firms reported rising year-over-year sales, this quarter rising revenue firms outnumber decliners by 1.29:1. The fact that earnings have risen far more than have revenues means that we are seeing an explosion in net margins (or, more precisely, we are recovering from the collapse in net margins a year ago).Sales Surprises Sales Surprises Yr/YrGrowth %Reported SurpriseMedian SalesSurpPos SalesSurpNeg #GrowPos #GrowNegAuto 14.25% 100.00% 9.28 5 1 4 2Construction -10.96% 100.00% 5.74 7 4 3 8Oils and Energy 1.55% 100.00% 4.41 33 8 17 24Computer and Tech 5.67% 100.00% 2.74 62 10 49 23Conglomerates -6.89% 100.00% 2.52 6 2 3 6Medical 12.52% 100.00% 2.38 35 11 42 4Business Service 1.50% 94.44% 2.20 14 3 9 8Basic Materials -14.99% 100.00% 2.02 14 9 6 17Industrial Products -15.75% 100.00% 1.74 13 6 8 11Consumer Staples 4.98% 100.00% 1.43 26 11 22 15Consumer Discretionary -3.16% 100.00% 1.33 25 11 22 14Transportation -6.91% 100.00% 0.80 6 3 1 8Retail/Wholesale 4.45% 93.18% 0.66 31 10 29 12Finance 38.51% 100.00% 0.61 29 20 45 31Aerospace 12.46% 100.00% -0.15 5 5 6 4Utilities -4.06% 100.00% -2.67 13 27 11 31S&P 6.07% 99.00% 1.66 324 141 277 218Reported Quarterly Growth: Total Net IncomeYear-over-year earnings growth is expected to be much lower in the first quarter than in the fourth quarter, but that is a function mostly of the big rise in sequential earnings from the fourth quarter to the first quarter of last year. However, if one strips out the Financials, the growth rate actually shows a big acceleration to 23.6% from 14.5%.Autos and Construction will be doing the negative-to-positive thing, so the percentage gains really are not meaningful for those sectors. Among the sectors that actually earned money in last year’s first quarter, growth will be led by the Materials sector where earnings are expected to more than double.However the biggest impact on total earnings will come from the Tech sector (it is much bigger than Materials), where earnings are expected to soar 55.1% over year-ago levels. Industrials, Energy and Transport will also show very strong earnings gains.• The bulk of the earnings growth for the S&P 500 as a whole has come from the Financial sector, which collectively lost $55.4 billion a year ago, but has earned $11.6 billion this year
"
879,AIG,"• Year-over-year growth much faster in the 4Q than in the 3Q (21.78%), but that is more about just how awful 4Q 2008 was. Sequential growth just 0.92%

Overall year-over-year revenue growth is expected to be slightly lower than in the fourth quarter, at 5.08% versus the 6.07% reported in the fourth quarter. While the overall level of revenue growth will be roughly comparable, the sources will be very different.Financials, which were responsible for more than half the revenue growth in the fourth quarter, are actually expected to see revenues plunge by 15.25% year over year in the first quarter. In the first quarter, revenue growth will be led by the Energy sector at 33.8%. Very strong revenue showings are also expected for the Materials, Autos and Tech Sectors.•    S&P 500 Revenues up 6.07% year over year in 4Q, a vast improvement over 10.82% revenue decline the same firms showed in the 3Q.

To qualify, the current mean estimate has to be greater than $0.50 and there must be more than 3 estimates for FY1. In addition to the change in the mean estimate, the net percentage of estimates being raised is shown for both FY1 and FY2, as well as the P/E ratios based on each year’s earnings is shown.Note that estimate momentum and value are not mutually exclusive, and that seven of the firms with the biggest positive estimate momentum have single digit P/Es based on FY2 earnings. The most interesting of these firms will be where the net revisions percentage (#up-#dn/Tot) is more than 0.50 but less than 1.00.Big mean estimate changes based on a handful of individual revisions are suspect, but could prove to be the most interesting if other analysts follow suit. On the other hand, if all the analysts have raised their estimates already, the mean estimate is less likely to rise again over the next month.Special Feature: Biggest FY1 Revisions Company Ticker %ChCurr Fiscal Yr Est - 4 wks  %ChNext Fiscal Yr Est - 4 wks  # Up-Dn/Tot%ChCurr Fiscal Yr Est - 4 wks  # Up-Dn/Tot%ChNext Fiscal Yr Est - 4 wks  P/E usingCurr FY Est P/E usingNext FY EstNvidia Corp NVDA 43.05% 33.66% 0.69 0.43 18.19 16.19Cliffs Natural CLF 33.29% 22.60% 0.69 0.50 14.11 10.46Sandisk Corp SNDK 29.01% 41.60% 0.80 0.71 14.02 12.37Deere & Co DE 26.65% 13.26% 0.96 0.81 18.41 14.51Analog Devices ADI 16.58% 9.78% 0.91 0.71 14.66 13.49Agilent Tech A 15.06% 13.46% 1.00 0.80 19.80 16.90Wynn Resrts Ltd WYNN 14.39% -1.76% 0.19 -0.15 101.47 66.70Salesforce.Com CRM 14.09% 18.73% -0.10 0.16 81.89 57.71Rowan Cos Inc RDC 13.16% 8.02% 0.74 0.42 11.69 13.92Whole Foods Mkt WFMI 12.88% 14.20% 1.00 0.82 29.20 25.84Sears Hldg Cp SHLD 12.88% 17.01% 0.63 0.29 39.30 35.08Newmont Mining NEM 12.59% 21.01% 0.44 0.31 14.76 13.75Chesapeake Engy CHK 11.96% 8.19% 0.57 0.39 8.83 8.65Autodesk Inc ADSK 11.48% 2.81% 0.73 0.40 34.98 25.67Appld Matls Inc AMAT 11.19% 10.15% 0.48 0.41 17.86 11.06Ford Motor Co F 9.47% 0.00% 0.08 0.00 14.10 9.53Limited Inc LTD 8.61% 6.48% 0.79 0.43 15.44 13.67Teradata Corp TDC 8.32% -3.09% 0.89 0.13 18.65 16.12Natl Semicon NSM 8.06% 8.26% 0.52 0.32 18.83 13.55Home Depot HD 8.00% 1.64% 0.97 0.36 17.77 15.10Priceline.Com PCLN 7.79% 10.27% 0.73 0.55 22.89 19.16Anadarko Petrol APC 6.23% -2.48% -0.08 -0.13 37.61 25.16Iron Mountain IRM 6.19% 3.18% 1.00 0.33 22.80 19.69Abercrombie ANF 6.17% 15.99% 0.43 0.32 24.31 17.26Data in this report, unless stated otherwise, is through the close on Thursday 3/11/2010.Dirk van Dijk, CFA is the Chief Equity Strategist for Zacks.com.

930,AIG,"Key Points:
"
931,AIG,"• With 472, or 94.4% of reports in, earnings season is very strong. Median surprise is 5.54%. Positive surprises beat disappointments by a 4.49 ratio. Positive surprises reported for 74.2% of all firms
"
932,AIG,"• Earnings of reported firms up 102.39% year over year
"
933,AIG,"• Big reported earnings growth driven by Financials moving from loss a year ago to profits now, but even excluding the financial sector earnings are up 12.5% year over year
"
934,AIG,"• Autos and Conglomerates perfect with no disappointments, Tech and Retail have only a single disappointment each
"
935,AIG,"• Strong 30.5% total net income growth expected for 2010, with 20.0% more expected for 2011, rebounding from a -22.9% decline in 2008 and -9.7% in 2009
"
936,AIG,"• Rebounding earnings for Finance, Materials and Energy to lead 2010 charge
"
937,AIG,"• Huge margin expansion in 4Q expected to continue in 2010 and 2011
"
938,AIG,"• Total revenues expected to fall 9.7% in 2009, rise 7.1% in 2010, up 6.5% in 2011
"
939,AIG,"• Revisions ratios fall to 1.61 for 2010, and to 1.70 for 2011, both still very strong readings,  total activity nearing seasonal peak
"
940,AIG,"• Retail, Tech and Auto revisions strong
"
941,AIG,"• Firms up/firms down ratio at 1.28 for 2010, 1.32 for 2011
"
942,AIG,"• S&P 500 expected to earn $550.9 billion in 2009, $718.9 billion in 2010, $862.3 billion in 2011
"
943,AIG,"• Bottom Up estimates: $58.98 for 2009, $77.08 for 2010, $92.68 for 2011
"
944,AIG,"• Top Down estimates: $57.45 for 2009, $76.05 for 2010, $88.22 for 2011We have decided to start focusing our analysis of the S&P 500 based on Zacks' own sector groupings rather than the S&P GICS sectors. There are 16 Zacks sectors and only 10 GICS sectors, so our groupings will result in better granularity of the data. The old way simply grouped too many very different companies together. In addition, we for the first time are presenting top line as well as bottom line expectations and surprise information. We use the convention of referring to the next full fiscal year to be completed as 2010, though not all firms are on December fiscal years. This can cause discontinuities in the data, particularly around this time of year. The data is based on FY1, not based on 2010, even though I may call it 2010 in the report.Finally last week, the market took notice of just how strong this earnings season has been. With 94.4% (or 472) of the S&P 500 reports in, the year-over-year earnings growth has simply been fabulous at 102.39%.AIG Report Shifts All NumbersRegular readers will note that we had a big jump in growth from last week. That is because we have now included the results of AIG (AIG  -  Free Report), and its massive year-ago losses. By any normal standard, its losses were enormous this year as well, but last year was not a normal standard. It is not like the $7.2 billion it lost in this year’s fourth quarter is chicken feed, but it is a huge improvement on the $37.9 billion it lost a year ago. AIG was, of course, not alone among the financials in reporting epic losses a year ago, but if losses were epic poems, then AIG last year was the Iliad and the Odyssey rolled into one.If just AIG is excluded, the growth rate drops to 42.9%, and if all the financials are excluded, the growth rate is just 12.5%. Still, firms with positive EPS growth outnumber those with falling EPS by a ratio of 1.84:1, and 64.8% of all firms reported positive EPS growth.However, even set against the expectations coming into the earnings season it has been an extremely good one. For every two earnings disappointments there have been almost nine positive surprises. In all, 74.2% of all firms reporting have come in with better-than-expected earnings. Half of all the surprises (including the disappointments) have been more than 5.54%.Even on the top line, things are coming in both better than last year and better than expected. Total revenues are 5.96% higher than a year ago among the 472 of S&P 500 firms that have already reported, and positive revenue surprises are beating revenue disappointments by a margin of 2.32:1. Put another way 66.7% of all firms have reported better than expected revenues. Overall, 57.2% of all firms have reported higher revenues than a year ago. In the third quarter, that figure was below 30%.Financials Tell the StoryWhile the dramatic growth in earnings is largely due to turnarounds in a handful of very large firms moving from big losses a year ago to profits this year, that is not the full story. Most of those big turnarounds were in the Financial sector. In total the 77 Financial companies that have reported so far have earned $8.44 billion this year, while those same firms lost a total of $55.66 billion a year ago.Earnings growth is dramatically higher than revenue growth, which means we are seeing a huge increase in net margins. That margin expansion is expected to continue, not only in 2010, but into 2011 as well. Earlier in 2009, margins were plunging. For the year as a whole, the decline in revenues is almost identical to the decline in net income.Looking at full year earnings, total net income is expected to be lower than that of 2008, but just by 9.73%, a much smaller decline than the 22.9% plunge in 2008 (Financials are the big swing factor). This year will be one of earnings recovery, with growth of 30.5% expected, but note that that will still leave earnings below 2007 levels.Further growth of 20.0% is expected for total earnings in 2011. As for the top line, after a 9.74% plunge in 2009, revenues are expected to grow by 7.10% in 2010, followed by 6.48% growth in 2011. In general, corporate revenue growth should be highly correlated with nominal GDP growth (however, the S&P 500 certainly does not make up all corporate revenue in the country, nor do all of the revenues come from in the U.S.; currency translation effects also play a role in overseas revenues). It looks like the analysts are collectively expecting a fairly strong economic recovery over the next two years.What to ExpectIn 2010, the percentage growth numbers will be not really meaningful for the Auto and Construction sectors. While the 2009 numbers will be positive, they are so close to break even that big percentage gains in 2010 are not to really be taken seriously. Among the larger sectors, Materials and the Financials are expected to be the growth leaders for the year (Financials also did the negative-to-positive thing in 2009).Energy is also expected to see a large rebound in its total profits. Together, Finance and Energy will account for more than half of all the incremental earnings in both 2010 and 2011, even though together they account for only 25% of the total market capitalization of the index. However, in the absence of mark-to-market rules, the quality of the earnings in the Financials is suspect.  Do you file their book values under fiction or non-fiction?The revisions ratios for both 2010 and 2011 are strong, and should give us confidence that those growth rates will actually be achieved, if not exceeded. Every sector but Utilities and Transportation has seen more estimates raised for 2010 than cut, and the revisions ratio for 2010 stands at an extremely strong 1.61 (although it has been slipping a bit in recent weeks). For 2011, the revisions ratio is at 1.70. In other words, the positive earnings surprises are causing the analysts to raise their sights for the future.Unlike the other three quarters of the year, there is no “mechanical reason to raise estimates in response to a positive earnings surprise. Fourth quarter 2009 earnings are not part of the full year 2010 earnings, the way the third quarter 2009 earnings were part of full year 2009 earnings.The upward estimate revisions are not just in a handful of firms either. The ratio of firms with rising estimates for 2010 to falling mean estimates stands at 1.28 for 2010 and 1.32 for 2011. The S&P 500 is selling for 14.3x consensus expectations for 2010, or an earnings yield of 6.99%, or well above the yield on the 10-year Treasury note (3.63%). The S&P is selling for just 11.9x consensus expectations for 2011. Stocks look very attractive, at least relative to bonds, at this point.Scorecard & Earnings Surprise

"
950,AIG,"•    Year-over-year Earnings Growth Ratio (# Positive Growth/# Negative Growth) at 1.84, a big improvement over recent quarters. 64.8% report positive growthIn evaluating the data presented here, keep the percentage reported in mind. The move to the 16 Zacks sectors means that even when all reports are in, some of the sectors will still have relatively few firms in them. For firms with only a few reports in, the median surprise will be very volatile as new firms are added to the sample.With 94.4% of the reports in, this has been a very strong earnings season. Yes, we had easy comps from a year ago, but 102.4% year-over-year growth is nothing to sneeze at.Most of that eye popping growth is due to a handful of firms, mostly in the financials. However, even if the financials are excluded, earnings growth is still 12.5%. The majority of firms are reporting higher earnings than a year ago. Earnings are coming in much better than expected, with 74.2% of all firms reporting coming in with better than expected earnings, only 16.5% disappointing.While all sectors have seen more positive surprises than disappointments, Tech has put on an absolutely stunning performance. With 98.6% of its results in, there have been 63 positive surprises, and just a single disappointment.Autos have far fewer firms, but with all of its results in, it has a perfect record, and a stunning 82.15% median surprise. Conglomerates also has a perfect record of 8 and 0. Retail, Discretionary and Business Service are almost perfect as well. Disappointments are concentrated in the Financials, as the sector is responsible for 29.5% of all firms falling short of expectations.Scorecard & Earnings Surprise Income Surprises Yr/YrGrowth %Reported SurpriseMedian EPSSurpPos EPSSurpNeg #GrowPos #GrowNegAuto    - to + 100.00% 82.15 6 0 5 1Construction    - to + 100.00% 33.96 8 3 7 4Consumer Discretionary 12.69% 97.14% 14.78 29 2 21 13Industrial Products -24.45% 94.74% 11.39 13 4 8 10Basic Materials 136.14% 95.65% 10.10 16 5 13 9Conglomerates -5.09% 88.89% 9.94 8 0 4 4Computer and Tech 46.03% 98.61% 9.83 63 1 50 21Retail/Wholesale 21.48% 83.72% 4.46 33 2 30 6Business Service 3.39% 85.00% 4.23 11 1 10 7Oils and Energy -0.25 92.50% 4.07 25 10 14 23Consumer Staples 0.15 94.74% 3.75 25 8 27 9Medical 0.02 100.00% 3.47 34 5 36 10Finance    - to + 96.05% 3.13 45 23 54 19Transportation -0.18 90.00% 2.74 6 3 1 8Utilities -0.13 90.48% 2.65 23 8 23 15Aerospace 0.16 100.00% 1.88 5 3 3 7S&P 102.39% 94.40% 5.54 350 78 306 166Sales Surprises• Sales Surprise ratio at 2.32, median surprise 1.68%; 66.7% of all firms do better than expected on top line

954,AIG,"• Medical firms with growing revenues outnumber falling revenue medical firms by more than 10:1Total revenues of the 472 S&P 500 firms that have reported are up a very strong 5.96%. This is mostly due to a handful of Financial firms that actually reported negative revenues last year. However, nine of the sectors have reported higher revenues than a year ago.In distinct contrast to the third quarter when less than one third of all firms reported rising year over year sales, this quarter rising revenue firms outnumber decliners by 1.29:1. The fact that earnings have risen far more than have revenues means that we are seeing an explosion in net margins (or more precisely, we are recovering from the collapse in net margins a year ago).Sales Surprises Sales Surprises Yr/YrGrowth %Reported SurpriseMedian SalesSurpPos SalesSurpNeg #GrowPos #GrowNegAuto 14.25% 100.00% 9.28 5 1 4 2Construction -10.96% 100.00% 5.74 7 4 3 8Oils and Energy 1.77% 92.50% 4.80 31 7 17 21Computer and Tech 5.67% 98.61% 2.74 62 10 49 23Conglomerates -7.06% 88.89% 2.52 6 2 2 6Medical 12.52% 100.00% 2.38 35 11 42 4Industrial Products -15.86% 94.74% 2.32 13 5 8 10Business Service 1.54% 85.00% 2.23 14 4 10 8Consumer Staples 4.90% 94.74% 1.43 26 11 22 15Basic Materials -14.94% 95.65% 1.33 13 9 6 16Consumer Discretionary -3.23% 97.14% 1.33 24 10 20 14Transportation -6.91% 90.00% 0.80 6 3 1 8Retail/Wholesale 4.28% 83.72% 0.66 28 9 25 12Finance 40.51% 96.05% 0.58 28 20 44 30Aerospace 12.46% 100.00% -0.15 5 5 6 4Utilities -3.76% 90.48% -3.87 12 25 11 28S&P 5.96% 94.40% 1.68 315 136 270 209Reported Quarterly Growth: Total Net Income

To qualify, the current mean estimate has to be greater than $0.50 and there must be more than 3 estimates for FY1. In addition to the change in the mean estimate, the net percentage of estimates being raised is shown for both FY1 and FY2, as well as the P/E ratios based on each year’s earnings.Note that estimate momentum and value are not mutually exclusive, and that seven of the firms with the biggest positive estimate momentum have single digit P/Es based on FY2 earnings. The most interesting of these firms will be where the net revisions percentage (#up-#dn/Tot) is more than 0.50 but less than 1.00.Big mean estimate changes based on a handful of individual revisions are suspect. On the other hand, if all the analysts have raised their estimates already, the mean estimate is less likely to rise again over the next month.Special Feature: Biggest FY1 Revisions Company Ticker %ChCurr Fiscal Yr Est - 4 wks  %ChNext Fiscal Yr Est - 4 wks  # Up-Dn/Tot%ChCurr Fiscal Yr Est - 4 wks  # Up-Dn/Tot%ChNext Fiscal Yr Est - 4 wks  P/E usingCurr FY Est P/E usingNext FY EstEastman Kodak EK 207.56% -180.00% 0.83 -0.40 10.70 N/AD R Horton Inc DHI 207.05% -2.85% 1.00 0.25 22.20 21.97Harman Intl Ind HAR 193.92% 31.64% 1.00 1.00 49.59 21.97Sandisk Corp SNDK 65.63% 110.92% 0.80 0.14 14.56 13.55Ford Motor Co F 62.94% 19.58% 0.93 0.55 13.12 8.39Nvidia Corp NVDA 57.29% 47.89% 0.72 0.45 17.26 15.39Broadcom Corp-A BRCM 41.36% 19.96% 0.88 0.50 24.06 20.59Teradyne Inc TER 34.95% 6.15% 0.86 0.50 10.56 8.80Cliffs Natural CLF 34.76% 26.54% 0.69 0.42 12.98 9.45Tyson Foods  A TSN 32.39% 26.07% 0.85 1.00 12.43 11.78Deere & Co DE 26.36% 12.97% 0.91 0.76 17.99 14.18Lexmark Intl LXK 24.24% 19.85% 0.71 0.29 10.98 10.18Black & Decker BDK 23.35% 16.50% 1.00 0.63 20.73 17.13Cummins Inc CMI 19.95% 13.86% 0.82 0.53 23.75 14.70Novellus Sys NVLS 17.57% 13.88% 0.69 0.20 12.78 9.77Agilent Tech A 16.27% 13.39% 1.00 0.78 18.70 16.14Analog Devices ADI 16.18% 9.70% 0.87 0.71 14.93 13.69Plum Creek Tmbr PCL 16.01% 0.11% 0.92 0.36 25.95 24.00Starwood Hotels HOT 15.48% 14.64% 0.89 0.39 59.39 38.17Salesforce.Com CRM 15.15% 16.71% -0.14 0.12 72.29 52.69Massey Egy Cpy MEE 15.13% 11.56% 0.70 0.44 16.08 9.10Chesapeake Engy CHK 14.07% 9.74% 0.60 0.43 9.09 8.94Emerson Elec Co EMR 13.74% 12.25% 0.94 0.88 19.73 16.48Sears Hldg Cp SHLD 13.49% -4.57% 0.57 0.17 36.18 31.59Watson Pharma WPI 13.49% 12.38% 0.29 0.47 12.31 11.17Whole Foods Mkt WFMI 12.88% 14.20% 1.00 0.82 28.55 25.26Microchip Tech MCHP 12.01% 12.41% 0.85 0.85 24.63 17.78Data in this report, unless stated otherwise, is through the close on Thursday 2/25/2010.Dirk van Dijk, CFA is the Chief Equity Strategist for Zacks.com.

"
1013,AIG,"• Bottom Up estimates: $58.98 for 2009, $77.08 for 2010, $92.68 for 2011
"
1014,AIG,"• Top Down estimates: $57.45 for 2009, $76.05 for 2010, $88.22 for 2011We have decided to start focusing our analysis of the S&P 500 based on Zacks' own sector groupings rather than the S&P GICS sectors. There are 16 Zacks sectors and only 10 GICS sectors, so our groupings will result in better granularity of the data. The old way simply grouped too many very different companies together. In addition, we for the first time are presenting top line as well as bottom line expectations and surprise information. We use the convention of referring to the next full fiscal year to be completed as 2010, though not all firms are on December fiscal years. This can cause discontinuities in the data, particularly around this time of year. The data is based on FY1, not based on 2010, even though I may call it 2010 in the report.Finally last week, the market took notice of just how strong this earnings season has been. With 94.4% (or 472) of the S&P 500 reports in, the year-over-year earnings growth has simply been fabulous at 102.39%.AIG Report Shifts All NumbersRegular readers will note that we had a big jump in growth from last week. That is because we have now included the results of AIG (AIG  -  Free Report), and its massive year-ago losses. By any normal standard, its losses were enormous this year as well, but last year was not a normal standard. It is not like the $7.2 billion it lost in this year’s fourth quarter is chicken feed, but it is a huge improvement on the $37.9 billion it lost a year ago. AIG was, of course, not alone among the financials in reporting epic losses a year ago, but if losses were epic poems, then AIG last year was the Iliad and the Odyssey rolled into one.If just AIG is excluded, the growth rate drops to 42.9%, and if all the financials are excluded, the growth rate is just 12.5%. Still, firms with positive EPS growth outnumber those with falling EPS by a ratio of 1.84:1, and 64.8% of all firms reported positive EPS growth.However, even set against the expectations coming into the earnings season it has been an extremely good one. For every two earnings disappointments there have been almost nine positive surprises. In all, 74.2% of all firms reporting have come in with better-than-expected earnings. Half of all the surprises (including the disappointments) have been more than 5.54%.Even on the top line, things are coming in both better than last year and better than expected. Total revenues are 5.96% higher than a year ago among the 472 of S&P 500 firms that have already reported, and positive revenue surprises are beating revenue disappointments by a margin of 2.32:1. Put another way 66.7% of all firms have reported better than expected revenues. Overall, 57.2% of all firms have reported higher revenues than a year ago. In the third quarter, that figure was below 30%.Financials Tell the StoryWhile the dramatic growth in earnings is largely due to turnarounds in a handful of very large firms moving from big losses a year ago to profits this year, that is not the full story. Most of those big turnarounds were in the Financial sector. In total the 77 Financial companies that have reported so far have earned $8.44 billion this year, while those same firms lost a total of $55.66 billion a year ago.Earnings growth is dramatically higher than revenue growth, which means we are seeing a huge increase in net margins. That margin expansion is expected to continue, not only in 2010, but into 2011 as well. Earlier in 2009, margins were plunging. For the year as a whole, the decline in revenues is almost identical to the decline in net income.Looking at full year earnings, total net income is expected to be lower than that of 2008, but just by 9.73%, a much smaller decline than the 22.9% plunge in 2008 (Financials are the big swing factor). This year will be one of earnings recovery, with growth of 30.5% expected, but note that that will still leave earnings below 2007 levels.Further growth of 20.0% is expected for total earnings in 2011. As for the top line, after a 9.74% plunge in 2009, revenues are expected to grow by 7.10% in 2010, followed by 6.48% growth in 2011. In general, corporate revenue growth should be highly correlated with nominal GDP growth (however, the S&P 500 certainly does not make up all corporate revenue in the country, nor do all of the revenues come from in the U.S.; currency translation effects also play a role in overseas revenues). It looks like the analysts are collectively expecting a fairly strong economic recovery over the next two years.What to ExpectIn 2010, the percentage growth numbers will be not really meaningful for the Auto and Construction sectors. While the 2009 numbers will be positive, they are so close to break even that big percentage gains in 2010 are not to really be taken seriously. Among the larger sectors, Materials and the Financials are expected to be the growth leaders for the year (Financials also did the negative-to-positive thing in 2009).Energy is also expected to see a large rebound in its total profits. Together, Finance and Energy will account for more than half of all the incremental earnings in both 2010 and 2011, even though together they account for only 25% of the total market capitalization of the index. However, in the absence of mark-to-market rules, the quality of the earnings in the Financials is suspect.  Do you file their book values under fiction or non-fiction?The revisions ratios for both 2010 and 2011 are strong, and should give us confidence that those growth rates will actually be achieved, if not exceeded. Every sector but Utilities and Transportation has seen more estimates raised for 2010 than cut, and the revisions ratio for 2010 stands at an extremely strong 1.61 (although it has been slipping a bit in recent weeks). For 2011, the revisions ratio is at 1.70. In other words, the positive earnings surprises are causing the analysts to raise their sights for the future.Unlike the other three quarters of the year, there is no “mechanical reason to raise estimates in response to a positive earnings surprise. Fourth quarter 2009 earnings are not part of the full year 2010 earnings, the way the third quarter 2009 earnings were part of full year 2009 earnings.The upward estimate revisions are not just in a handful of firms either. The ratio of firms with rising estimates for 2010 to falling mean estimates stands at 1.28 for 2010 and 1.32 for 2011. The S&P 500 is selling for 14.3x consensus expectations for 2010, or an earnings yield of 6.99%, or well above the yield on the 10-year Treasury note (3.63%). The S&P is selling for just 11.9x consensus expectations for 2011. Stocks look very attractive, at least relative to bonds, at this point.Scorecard & Earnings Surprise

1020,AIG,"•    Year-over-year Earnings Growth Ratio (# Positive Growth/# Negative Growth) at 1.84, a big improvement over recent quarters. 64.8% report positive growthIn evaluating the data presented here, keep the percentage reported in mind. The move to the 16 Zacks sectors means that even when all reports are in, some of the sectors will still have relatively few firms in them. For firms with only a few reports in, the median surprise will be very volatile as new firms are added to the sample.With 94.4% of the reports in, this has been a very strong earnings season. Yes, we had easy comps from a year ago, but 102.4% year-over-year growth is nothing to sneeze at.Most of that eye popping growth is due to a handful of firms, mostly in the financials. However, even if the financials are excluded, earnings growth is still 12.5%. The majority of firms are reporting higher earnings than a year ago. Earnings are coming in much better than expected, with 74.2% of all firms reporting coming in with better than expected earnings, only 16.5% disappointing.While all sectors have seen more positive surprises than disappointments, Tech has put on an absolutely stunning performance. With 98.6% of its results in, there have been 63 positive surprises, and just a single disappointment.Autos have far fewer firms, but with all of its results in, it has a perfect record, and a stunning 82.15% median surprise. Conglomerates also has a perfect record of 8 and 0. Retail, Discretionary and Business Service are almost perfect as well. Disappointments are concentrated in the Financials, as the sector is responsible for 29.5% of all firms falling short of expectations.Scorecard & Earnings Surprise Income Surprises Yr/YrGrowth %Reported SurpriseMedian EPSSurpPos EPSSurpNeg #GrowPos #GrowNegAuto    - to + 100.00% 82.15 6 0 5 1Construction    - to + 100.00% 33.96 8 3 7 4Consumer Discretionary 12.69% 97.14% 14.78 29 2 21 13Industrial Products -24.45% 94.74% 11.39 13 4 8 10Basic Materials 136.14% 95.65% 10.10 16 5 13 9Conglomerates -5.09% 88.89% 9.94 8 0 4 4Computer and Tech 46.03% 98.61% 9.83 63 1 50 21Retail/Wholesale 21.48% 83.72% 4.46 33 2 30 6Business Service 3.39% 85.00% 4.23 11 1 10 7Oils and Energy -0.25 92.50% 4.07 25 10 14 23Consumer Staples 0.15 94.74% 3.75 25 8 27 9Medical 0.02 100.00% 3.47 34 5 36 10Finance    - to + 96.05% 3.13 45 23 54 19Transportation -0.18 90.00% 2.74 6 3 1 8Utilities -0.13 90.48% 2.65 23 8 23 15Aerospace 0.16 100.00% 1.88 5 3 3 7S&P 102.39% 94.40% 5.54 350 78 306 166Sales Surprises• Sales Surprise ratio at 2.32, median surprise 1.68%; 66.7% of all firms do better than expected on top line

1023,AIG,"• Nine sectors have a majority of firms with positive revenue growth, seven have more with falling revenues
"
1024,AIG,"• Medical firms with growing revenues outnumber falling revenue medical firms by more than 10:1Total revenues of the 472 S&P 500 firms that have reported are up a very strong 5.96%. This is mostly due to a handful of Financial firms that actually reported negative revenues last year. However, nine of the sectors have reported higher revenues than a year ago.In distinct contrast to the third quarter when less than one third of all firms reported rising year over year sales, this quarter rising revenue firms outnumber decliners by 1.29:1. The fact that earnings have risen far more than have revenues means that we are seeing an explosion in net margins (or more precisely, we are recovering from the collapse in net margins a year ago).Sales Surprises Sales Surprises Yr/YrGrowth %Reported SurpriseMedian SalesSurpPos SalesSurpNeg #GrowPos #GrowNegAuto 14.25% 100.00% 9.28 5 1 4 2Construction -10.96% 100.00% 5.74 7 4 3 8Oils and Energy 1.77% 92.50% 4.80 31 7 17 21Computer and Tech 5.67% 98.61% 2.74 62 10 49 23Conglomerates -7.06% 88.89% 2.52 6 2 2 6Medical 12.52% 100.00% 2.38 35 11 42 4Industrial Products -15.86% 94.74% 2.32 13 5 8 10Business Service 1.54% 85.00% 2.23 14 4 10 8Consumer Staples 4.90% 94.74% 1.43 26 11 22 15Basic Materials -14.94% 95.65% 1.33 13 9 6 16Consumer Discretionary -3.23% 97.14% 1.33 24 10 20 14Transportation -6.91% 90.00% 0.80 6 3 1 8Retail/Wholesale 4.28% 83.72% 0.66 28 9 25 12Finance 40.51% 96.05% 0.58 28 20 44 30Aerospace 12.46% 100.00% -0.15 5 5 6 4Utilities -3.76% 90.48% -3.87 12 25 11 28S&P 5.96% 94.40% 1.68 315 136 270 209Reported Quarterly Growth: Total Net Income

To qualify, the current mean estimate has to be greater than $0.50 and there must be more than 3 estimates for FY1. In addition to the change in the mean estimate, the net percentage of estimates being raised is shown for both FY1 and FY2, as well as the P/E ratios based on each year’s earnings.Note that estimate momentum and value are not mutually exclusive, and that seven of the firms with the biggest positive estimate momentum have single digit P/Es based on FY2 earnings. The most interesting of these firms will be where the net revisions percentage (#up-#dn/Tot) is more than 0.50 but less than 1.00.Big mean estimate changes based on a handful of individual revisions are suspect. On the other hand, if all the analysts have raised their estimates already, the mean estimate is less likely to rise again over the next month.Special Feature: Biggest FY1 Revisions Company Ticker %ChCurr Fiscal Yr Est - 4 wks  %ChNext Fiscal Yr Est - 4 wks  # Up-Dn/Tot%ChCurr Fiscal Yr Est - 4 wks  # Up-Dn/Tot%ChNext Fiscal Yr Est - 4 wks  P/E usingCurr FY Est P/E usingNext FY EstEastman Kodak EK 207.56% -180.00% 0.83 -0.40 10.70 N/AD R Horton Inc DHI 207.05% -2.85% 1.00 0.25 22.20 21.97Harman Intl Ind HAR 193.92% 31.64% 1.00 1.00 49.59 21.97Sandisk Corp SNDK 65.63% 110.92% 0.80 0.14 14.56 13.55Ford Motor Co F 62.94% 19.58% 0.93 0.55 13.12 8.39Nvidia Corp NVDA 57.29% 47.89% 0.72 0.45 17.26 15.39Broadcom Corp-A BRCM 41.36% 19.96% 0.88 0.50 24.06 20.59Teradyne Inc TER 34.95% 6.15% 0.86 0.50 10.56 8.80Cliffs Natural CLF 34.76% 26.54% 0.69 0.42 12.98 9.45Tyson Foods  A TSN 32.39% 26.07% 0.85 1.00 12.43 11.78Deere & Co DE 26.36% 12.97% 0.91 0.76 17.99 14.18Lexmark Intl LXK 24.24% 19.85% 0.71 0.29 10.98 10.18Black & Decker BDK 23.35% 16.50% 1.00 0.63 20.73 17.13Cummins Inc CMI 19.95% 13.86% 0.82 0.53 23.75 14.70Novellus Sys NVLS 17.57% 13.88% 0.69 0.20 12.78 9.77Agilent Tech A 16.27% 13.39% 1.00 0.78 18.70 16.14Analog Devices ADI 16.18% 9.70% 0.87 0.71 14.93 13.69Plum Creek Tmbr PCL 16.01% 0.11% 0.92 0.36 25.95 24.00Starwood Hotels HOT 15.48% 14.64% 0.89 0.39 59.39 38.17Salesforce.Com CRM 15.15% 16.71% -0.14 0.12 72.29 52.69Massey Egy Cpy MEE 15.13% 11.56% 0.70 0.44 16.08 9.10Chesapeake Engy CHK 14.07% 9.74% 0.60 0.43 9.09 8.94Emerson Elec Co EMR 13.74% 12.25% 0.94 0.88 19.73 16.48Sears Hldg Cp SHLD 13.49% -4.57% 0.57 0.17 36.18 31.59Watson Pharma WPI 13.49% 12.38% 0.29 0.47 12.31 11.17Whole Foods Mkt WFMI 12.88% 14.20% 1.00 0.82 28.55 25.26Microchip Tech MCHP 12.01% 12.41% 0.85 0.85 24.63 17.78Data in this report, unless stated otherwise, is through the close on Thursday 2/25/2010.Dirk van Dijk, CFA is the Chief Equity Strategist for Zacks.com.

1070,AIG,"The turmoil in the financial markets has created a highly challenging environment for the U.S. insurance industry, forcing many companies to take immense write-downs. This trend is expected to continue at least through the first half of 2010, though there are some early signs of an economic recovery. Also, structural economies of scale have pushed the industry toward consolidation.While enormous financial support from the government rescued AIG (AIG  -  Free Report) from collapse, many other firms remain under tremendous pressure or have fallen by the wayside. Competition within the segments of the industry has reduced, which is consolidating through mergers and acquisitions. This has increased the market shares of the largest firms.We expect static growth with persistent soft market conditions and an ongoing market crisis, resulting in further consolidation in the industry. However, we expect the overall condition to improve in the second half of 2010, should the economic recovery accelerate.Life InsurersContinued losses in the investment portfolio and lower income from the variable annuity business will continue to hurt earnings of life insurers. Most life insurers have substantial exposure to commercial-real-estate-backed loans and securities, which will result in further losses in the coming quarters.As the industry’s statutory capital levels fell sharply, some companies were trying to raise capital through the Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP). In May 2009, the Treasury approved six life insurers for capital infusion under TARP. Hartford Financial Services Group Inc. (HIG  -  Free Report) and Lincoln Financial Group (LNC  -  Free Report) received federal aid. The other four insurers, Prudential Financial (PRU), Principal Financial Group (PFG), Allstate Corporation (ALL) and Ameriprise Financial (AMP  -  Free Report) decided not to accept bailout funds.Health InsurersThe U.S. health care system is significantly dependent on private health insurance, which is the primary source of coverage for most Americans. Approximately 58% of Americans have private health insurance. Unfortunately, these insurance companies utilize a pre-existing exemption clause in order to control costs and maximize profit.On Nov 7, 2009, the House of Representatives passed a sweeping health care bill. The legislation includes changes that would prevent private insurance companies from using the pre-existing condition clause. Additionally, it would provide the government the power to negotiate policy premiums for those who opt to participate in the public option. If enacted, the move would mean greater federal involvement in the industry.On Dec 24, 2009, the Senate approved historic legislation that promises to provide health insurance coverage to approximately 31 million people. The Senate proposal prohibits insurance companies from denying coverage because of pre-existing medical conditions. It also prohibits companies from hiking insurance prices based on an applicant’s health or gender. On Jan 20, 2010, President Barack Obama and the allies of congress indicated that they will try to reduce the sweeping health care renovation in an effort to keep it alive, at least partly.Property & Casualty InsurersMajor catastrophe losses in 2008 resulted in significant deterioration of companies' underwriting results, and steep losses in the investment portfolios since the beginning of 2008 significantly reduced the capital adequacy of most insurers.During 2009, the seizure of credit markets and rising concerns over defaults pushed bond prices down sharply, causing significant realized and unrealized capital losses on insurer portfolios. Holding two-thirds of the invested assets in the form of bonds, the capacity of the Property & Casualty insurers is highly sensitive to changes in credit market conditions.While a modest recovery of credit and equity markets may lead to a reduction in the unrealized investment losses in the upcoming quarters, the premium rates continued to decline, though at a slower pace.Reduced financial flexibility and weak underwriting and reserves have further added to their woes. The only positive trend visible as of now is a slight improvement in some insurance pricing after continued deterioration during the last couple of years.ReinsurersLosses from the investment portfolios of reinsurance companies have surged during the last few quarters. In the second half of 2008, the underwriting profits were severely hurt by Hurricanes Ike and Gustav. However, the pricing improved during 2009 and is expected to remain firm going forward.With the signs of recovery in the capital market (though still weak by any means), the concerns related to reinsurers' ability to access the capital markets on reasonable terms has sufficiently mellowed. Considering this fact, along with the relative improvement in macroeconomic conditions and better financial performance of reinsurance companies, Fitch Ratings revised its outlook on the global reinsurance industry to stable from negative in Nov 2009.The rating agency has also cited that the reinsurance sector's credit quality is less sensitive to macroeconomic factors than that of many other financial services sectors. The agency noted that asset values of reinsurers have been improving markedly. However, we expect slightly lower favorable reserve development trends in the upcoming quarters as there are lingering concerns about the overall economy.OPPORTUNITIESWe remain positive on reinsurer PartnerRe Ltd. (PRE) due to its excellent underwriting abilities, strong capitalization, solid ratings and reputation in the market, which will enable it to take advantage of the stronger demand and better pricing being witnessed currently.Specific insurers that we like with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) include Manulife Financial Corporation (MFC  -  Free Report), Phoenix Companies Inc. (PNX), Universal American Corp. (UAM), American International Group, Inc. (AIG  -  Free Report), Hartford Financial Services Group Inc. (HIG  -  Free Report), Max Capital Group Ltd. (MXGL), EMC Insurance Group Inc.  and Infinity Property and Casualty Corp. (IPCC).There are currently a number of stocks in the U.S. banking universe with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) including Enstar Group Limited , FBL Financial Group Inc. (FFG  -  Free Report), Unitrin Inc. (UTR), Allied World Assurance Company Holdings Ltd. (AWH), Aspen Insurance Holdings Ltd. (AHL), Everest Re Group Ltd. (RE), Greenlight Capital Re, Ltd. (GLRE), Mercer Insurance Group Inc. (MIGP) and RenaissanceRe Holdings Ltd. (RNR).WEAKNESSESWe expect continued pressure on investment portfolios and lower income from the variable annuity business will restrict earnings growth rate of life insurers. Also, reduced financial flexibility and weak underwriting will hurt earnings of Property & Casualty Insurers.However, in view of the limited downside potential at this time, there are currently a small number of stocks with a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) including AXA (AXA), Conseco Inc. (CNO) and Prudential plc (PUK).
"
1071,AIG,"After enduring extraordinary shocks in 2008, the U.S. banks entered an exceptional state of turmoil in 2009. Starting as a credit issue in the subprime segment of the mortgage market, the sticky situation infected almost the entire financial services industry, and all corners of the globe. In other words, the financial crisis ultimately morphed into a massive economic crisis, which has had major ramifications across the whole world.Entering 2010, although the banking industry is dealing with liquidity and confidence challenges, it is now comparatively stable with financial support from the U.S. government. The government had taken several steps, including programs offering capital injections and debt guarantees, to stabilize the financial system.We believe that the worst of the credit crisis is now behind us. After more than a year of initiating the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), a lot has improved with respect to the economic crisis.But the banking system is not yet out of the woods as there are persistent problems that need to be addressed by the government before shifting the strategy to growth. We believe that the U.S. economy will regain its growth momentum once these issues are resolved.While the bigger banks benefited greatly from the various programs launched by the government, many smaller banks are still in a very weak financial state and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s (FDIC) list of problem banks continues to grow.Despite the government’s strong efforts, we continue to see bank failures. As the industry tolerates bad loans that were made during the credit explosion, the trouble in the banking system goes even deeper, increasing the possibility of more bank failures.Furthermore, government efforts have not succeeded in restoring the lending activity at the banks. Lower lending will continue to hurt margins and the overall economy, though the low interest rate environment should be beneficial to banks with a liability-sensitive balance sheet.Out of the $247 billion given to banks, $162 billion has come back from the healthy banks who have repaid their TARP funds. Banks have paid an additional $11 billion in interest and dividends. Also, taxpayers have received decent returns on many of its financial-sector investments. Repayments under the TARP have generated a 17% annualized return from stock-warrant repurchases and $12 billion in dividend payments from dozens of banks.Many of the financial institutions that have already repaid the bailout money include JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report), American Express (AXP), Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report), Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report), Capital One (COF), BB&T (BBT), US Bancorp (USB  -  Free Report), Bank of America (BAC), Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) and Citigroup (C).Following the U.S. Treasury’s announcement requiring the world’s banks to maintain stronger capital and liquidity standards by the end of 2010 to prevent a re-run of the global financial crisis, 15 large banks that control the majority of derivative trading worldwide have committed themselves to maintaining greater transparency in the $600 trillion market that needs stricter oversight in the interest of the global financial system.Moreover, in mid-January 2010, the Obama Administration proposed a tax on about 50 of the nation's largest financial firms in order to recover the losses incurred by the government on its $700 billion bailout program. On approval of the Congress, the tax, which the White House calls a ""financial crisis responsibility fee,"" would force the banks to reportedly pay the federal government about $90 billion over 10 years.Targeting banks to recover the shortfall in bailout money can be considered justified, as they are the major beneficiaries of the taxpayers' largesse. Most of the bailout loan was provided to financial institutions, as they form the backbone of the economy and were the primary victims of the crisis.If the economic recovery tails off, high-risk loan defaults could re-emerge. About $500 billion in commercial real estate loans would be due annually over the next few years.Above all, there are lingering concerns related to the banking industry as well as the economy. Continued asset-quality troubles are expected to force many banks to record substantial additional provisions at least through the end of 2010. This will be a drag on the profitability of many banks for extended periods, which will further stretch their capital levels.For the last few quarters, the banks have mainly suffered from the losses in mortgages and Commercial Real Estate (residential construction) loans. Housing prices have continued to decline, and given the sharp increase in unemployment we anticipate continued losses in these portfolios.While the state of the economy is showing signs of recovery, a lot remains to be done. The Treasury continues to have huge direct investments in institutions like American International Group (AIG), Fannie Mae (FNM) and Freddie Mac (FRE).In conclusion, we expect loan losses on commercial real estate portfolio to remain high for banks that hold large amounts of high-risk loans. Also, as a result of a rise in charge-offs, the levels of reserve coverage have fallen over the past quarters and the banks will have to make higher provisions at least in the near term, affecting their profitability. We think that the financial crisis is far from over, and we will have to wait awhile to write the end of this crisis story.OPPORTUNITIESThe Treasury’s requirement of focusing banking institutions towards higher-quality capital will help banks absorb big losses. Though this would somewhat limit the profitability of banks, a proper implementation would bring stability to the overall sector and hopefully address bank failures.Specific banks that we like with a Zacks ranking of 1 (Strong Buy) include BancFirst Corporation (BANF), First Capital Bancorp, Inc. (FCVA) and Bridge Capital Holdings (BBNK).There are currently a number of stocks in the U.S. banking universe with a Zacks ranking of 2 (Buy) including 1st United Bancorp, Inc. (FUBC), Ameris Bancorp (ABCB), Doral Financial Corp. (DRL), Tennessee Commerce Bancorp Inc. (TNCC), United Bankshares Inc. (UBSI  -  Free Report) and North Valley Bancorp (NOVB).We favor Commerce Bancshares Inc. (CBSH) in this space since this company is one of the few names that did not report losses even during the current financial crisis. We believe that Commerce is one of the best-capitalized banks in the industry and will generate positive earnings throughout the credit cycle. While the bank had a decent growth in deposits in the most recent quarter, trends in its credit metrics were negative.WEAKNESSESThe financial system is going through massive de-leveraging. Banks in particular have lowered leverage. The implication for banks is that the profitability metrics (like returns on equity and return on assets) will be lower than in recent years.
"
1072,AIG,"Furthermore, the current crisis has dramatically accelerated the consolidation trend in the industry. As a result, failure of a large financial institution will be a major concern in the upcoming quarters as weaker entities are being absorbed by the larger ones.We think banks with high exposure to housing and Commercial Real Estate loans, like Wilmington Trust Corporation (WL), KeyCorp (KEY  -  Free Report) and Zions Bancorp (ZION  -  Free Report), will remain under pressure.Also, there are currently a number of stocks with a Zacks ranking of 5 (Strong Sell) including Southwest Bancorp Inc. (OKSB), Texas Capital BancShares Inc. (TCBI  -  Free Report), Bank of Hawaii Corporation (BOH), Cathay General Bancorp (CATY), Central Valley Community Bancorp (CVCY), Pacific Continental Corp.

"
1080,AIG,"Insurers' losses from natural disasters surged in 2008, with maximum losses resulting from Hurricane Ike (insured losses of approximately $15 billion). Six storms --  Dolly, Edouard, Fay, Gustav, Hanna and Ike -- hit the U.S. coast last year, after two years of mild activity.
"
1081,AIG,"Major catastrophe losses of 2008 resulted in significant deterioration of the underwriting results, and steep losses in the investment portfolios since the beginning of 2008 significantly reduced the capital adequacy of most insurers.
"
1082,AIG,"During the first nine months of 2009, the seizure of credit markets and rising concerns over defaults pushed bond prices down sharply, causing significant realized and unrealized capital losses on insurer portfolios. Holding two-thirds of the invested assets in the form of bonds, the capacity of the Property & Casualty insurers is highly sensitive to changes in credit market conditions. While a modest recovery of credit and equity markets may lead to a reduction in the unrealized investment losses in the upcoming quarters, the premium rates continued to decline, though at a slower pace.

"
1087,AIG,"OPPORTUNITIES
"
1088,AIG,"We remain positive on reinsurer PartnerRe Ltd. (PRE) due to its excellent underwriting abilities, strong capitalization, solid ratings and reputation in the market, which will enable it to take advantage of the stronger demand and better pricing being witnessed currently. We also have strong Outperform ratings on Nymagic Inc. (NYM), The Travelers Companies, Inc. (TRV  -  Free Report) and United America Indemnity, Ltd. (INDM).WEAKNESSES
"
1089,AIG,"Currently, we do not have any Sell recommendations on insurance stocks under our coverage, in view of the limited downside potential at this time. However, due to some concerns, we are maintaining our Neutral recommendations on AFLAC Inc. (AFL  -  Free Report), Amerisafe, Inc. (AMSF  -  Free Report), Hartford Financial Services (HIG  -  Free Report) and PMI Group (PMI).                    
"
1090,AIG,"As we announced in last week's video commentary, I am leaving Zacks. Though I enjoy my job, a great opportunity was presented to me.
"
1091,AIG,"Our Director of Research, Sheraz Mian, will take over my duties. Over the years, I've spent a lot of time speaking with Sheraz about the markets and stocks and can assure you that you will be in good hands. Furthermore, we rely on Zacks Equity Research recommendations for selecting stocks for the Focus List. Finally, and most importantly, the committee that has helped me manage our portfolios is remaining intact. Therefore, I think you will find the transition to be smooth.
"
1092,AIG,"In terms of investing philosophy, one of the things that I will take with me is a stronger appreciation of earnings estimate revisions. I paid attention to consensus estimates prior to joining Zacks, but not with the same level of awareness that I now have. The difference being the greatly increased attention I give to revisions, in particular whether profit projections are rising or falling.
"
1093,AIG,"As you know, at Zacks, we heavily promote the concept of following earnings estimate revisions. The philosophy is simple, buy when estimates are rising and sell when estimates are falling.
"
1094,AIG,"It may sound a good marketing scheme, but the reality is that it really does work. This is particularly the case when estimates are rising on several companies within the same industry or sector. I can personally tell you that tracking earnings estimate revisions tipped me off to big rallies in copper, fertilizer and, most recently, tech stocks. They also helped tipped me off that there were problems with American International Group (AIG  -  Free Report) in February 2008 - well before the financial system fell into a crisis.
"
1095,AIG,"I believe in earnings estimate revisions so much that I specifically discuss them in my forthcoming book on investing. Trust me, if you want to do a gut-check on your personal investing philosophy, write a book about it. There is nothing in my book that I don't fully believe in. (The book is tentatively scheduled to be published in the first quarter (probably March 2010) by W&A Publishing. I'd tell you the title, but the publisher and I have not finalized what it will be.)
"
1096,AIG,"If the only thing you ever do with earnings estimates is to check whether they are being raised or lowered, you will be one step ahead of the game. Earnings estimates are not a substitute for conducting other analysis, such as making sure the valuation is attractive or that the business model is sound, but they are a vital tool for identifying profitable investments.
"
1097,AIG,"I'll be at Zacks through the remainder of the week and you can email me here at crotblut@zacks.com. You can also follow me on Twitter at http://twitter.com/charlesrotblut, even if you don't have a personal twitter account.
"
1098,AIG,"Portfolio UpdatesCoach (COH) was added to the Growth & Income portfolio. The company has successfully gone after the ""affordable luxury"" market with high quality products priced below the likes of Prada and Gucci. Furthermore, the company continues to make inroads into China. We liked the fact that COH's fiscal first-quarter profits were well above the Zacks Consensus and that overall sales are holding steady despite the still questionable economic backdrop.
"
1099,AIG,"Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) was sold from the Focus List. Earnings estimates for fiscal 2010 have fallen. At the same time, the share price has lagged. Rather than risk a potential loss, we decided that the prudent was to lock in the gain.
"
1100,AIG,"The Markets
"
1101,AIG,"The major indexes have been trading a fairly tight range, despite better-than-expected earnings. Such action is not surprising given that the rally has lasted for more than 7 months. The Dow seems have found near-term resistance at 10,160.
"
1102,AIG,"One of the things I will be watching this week is the advance GDP report. I think the risk for stocks is to the downside, especially if the number comes in below 3%. (Economists are projecting GDP growth of 3.1%).
"
1103,AIG,"Volume continues to be light overall, suggesting an ongoing lack of conviction. With a few exceptions (e.g. Apple (AAPL)), positive earnings surprises just don't seem to be inspiring traders. This said, the bull continues to breathe.
"
1104,AIG,"I do think we will eventually end up in a prolonged trading range. It's just a question of what that range will be.
"
1105,AIG,"Thanks for being a subscriber and allowing me to share my views on the markets and the economy. I wish you prosperity, good health and lots of happiness.

We believe that the U.S. economy will regain its growth momentum once these issues are resolved.
"
1110,AIG,"While the bigger banks benefited greatly from the various programs launched by the government, many smaller banks are still in a very weak financial state and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporations (FDIC) list of problem banks continues to grow. In the second quarter of 2009, the number of banks on the FDIC's list of problem institutions grew to 416 from 305 in the first quarter. This is the highest number since the savings and loan crisis in 1994.
"
1111,AIG,"Despite the governments heavy efforts, we continue to see bank failures. Increasing loan losses on commercial real estate are expected to cause more bank failures in the next few years. The FDIC anticipates the bank failures to cost about $70 billion over the next five years.
"
1112,AIG,"Furthermore, government efforts have not succeeded in restoring the lending activity at the banks. Lower lending will continue to hurt margins, though the low interest rate environment should be beneficial to the banks with a liability-sensitive balance sheet.
"
1113,AIG,"Out of the $240 billion given to banks, $70 billion has come back as the healthiest banks have started repaying TARP funds. The Treasury Secretary estimates that banks will repay another $50 billion over the next 12 to 18 months. Also, taxpayers have received decent returns on many of its financial-sector investments. Repayments under the TARP have generated a 17% annualized return from stock-warrant repurchases and $12 billion in dividend payments from dozens of banks.
"
1114,AIG,"Many of the financial institutions that have already repaid the bailout money include JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report), American Express (AXP), Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report), Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report), Capital One (COF  -  Free Report), BB&T (BBT) and US Bancorp (USB  -  Free Report). Also, banks like Bank of America (BAC), Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) and Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) are expected to exit TARP over the next 12 to 18 months.
"
1115,AIG,"However, the situation is about to be reversed as regulators are considering asking healthy banks to bail out the government soon, in order to replenish the FDICs coffers. The increasing number of bank failures has caused a rapid decline in the FDICs funds as it has been appointed receiver for the failed banks.
"
1116,AIG,"Also, following the U.S. Treasurys announcement requiring the worlds banks to maintain stronger capital and liquidity standards by the end of next year to prevent a re-run of the global financial crisis, 15 large banks that control the majority of derivative trading worldwide have committed themselves to maintaining greater transparency in the $600 trillion market that needs stricter oversight in the interest of the global financial system.
"
1117,AIG,"However, there are lingering concerns related to the banking industry as well as the economy. Continued asset-quality troubles are expected to force many banks to record substantial additional provisions for the remainder of 2009 and all of 2010. This will be a drag on the profitability of many banks for extended periods and will further add stress to their capital levels.
"
1118,AIG,"For the last few quarters, the banks have mainly suffered due to the losses in mortgages and Commercial Real Estate (residential construction loans). Housing prices have continued to decline, and given the sharp increase in the level of unemployment we anticipate continued losses in these portfolios. Furthermore, deterioration in other Commercial Real Estate loans is now rising at a rapid pace and the downturn in this class is also likely to emerge as a major challenge.
"
1119,AIG,"Given the negative macro backdrop, we expect losses to continue to increase in the other asset classes as well, especially in consumer-related loans. 
"
1120,AIG,"While the state of the economy is showing signs of recovery, a lot remains to be done. The Treasury continues to have huge direct investments in institutions like American International Group (AIG), Fannie Mae (FNM) and Freddie Mac (FRE).
"
1121,AIG,"We expect loan losses on commercial real estate portfolio to remain high for banks that hold large amounts of high-risk loans. Also, as a result of a rise in charge-offs, the levels of reserve coverage have fallen over the past quarters and the banks will have to make higher provisions in the coming quarters, affecting their profitability. We think that the financial crisis is far from over, and we will have to wait awhile to write the end line of the crisis story.
"
1122,AIG,"OPPORTUNITIES
"
1123,AIG,"The Treasurys requirement of focusing banking institutions towards higher-quality capital will help banks absorb big losses. Though this would somewhat limit the profitability of banks, a proper implementation would bring stability to the overall sector and hopefully address bank failures.
"
1124,AIG,"We favor Commerce Bancshares Inc. (CBSH  -  Free Report) in this space since this company is one of the few names that did not report losses even during the current financial crisis. We believe that Commerce is one of the best capitalized banks in the industry, and will generate positive earnings throughout the credit cycle. While the bank had a decent growth in deposits in the most recent quarter, trends in its credit metrics were in the negative direction.  
"
1125,AIG,"WEAKNESSES
"
1126,AIG,"The financial system is going through massive de-leveraging. Banks in particular have lowered leverage. The implication for banks is that the profitability metrics (like returns on equity and return on assets) will be lower than in recent years.
"
1127,AIG,"Furthermore, the current crisis has dramatically accelerated the consolidation trend in the industry. As a result, failure of a large financial institution will be a major concern in the upcoming quarters as weaker entities are absorbed by larger ones.  
"
1128,AIG,"We think banks with high exposure to housing and Commercial Real Estate loans, like Wilmington Trust Corporation (WL), KeyCorp (KEY  -  Free Report) and Zions Bancorp (ZION  -  Free Report) will remain under pressure.
"
1129,AIG,"It was a quieter day that saw modest gains on low volume. Financials were some of the bigger winners on news of American International Group's (AIG  -  Free Report) CEO stating that the company will repay bailout money to the government. 
"
1130,AIG,"Also helping stocks advance today was the Philadelphia Federal Reserve announcing a pickup in mid-Atlantic manufacturing.    
"
1131,AIG,"Thursdays Dow was up 70.89 points, or 0.8%, closing at 9,350.05. The S&P 500 climbed 10.91 points, or 1.1%, to 1,007.37. The Nasdaq rose 19.98 points, or 1.0%, to 1,989.22.

"
1137,AIG,"Key Points:We now have more positive revisions than cuts for 2009; 2010 gets close
"
1138,AIG,"Reported Q1 total net income fell 31.7% from year ago, but was up 90.1% from Q4
"
1139,AIG,"Excluding Financials, total earnings were down 35.5% from a year ago and 13.7% from Q4
"
1140,AIG,"The decline is expected to continue in Q2, with a 36.4% year-over-year decline
"
1141,AIG,"Total net income expected to fall 15.4% for all of 2009, after 19.3% fall in 2008
"
1142,AIG,"Financials expected to rebound after disastrous 2008
"
1143,AIG,"Bottom-up estimate for S&P 500 (SPX) now $57.25 in 2009 vs. $57.21 last week.
"
1144,AIG,"S&P 500 now expected to earn $72.49 in 2010 versus $72.61 last week
"
1145,AIG,"Total Net Income Growth
"
1146,AIG,"The books are now closed on the first quarter earnings season. It was a book open to many interpretations, depending on which sort of spin you want to bring to it.
"
1147,AIG,"If you were inclined to be looking for green shoots, there was ammo for your argument in that the total net income reported was far higher (almost double) in the first quarter than in the fourth quarter of 2008. A bull would also be able to point to the fact that more than twice as many firms reported earnings above expectations than disappointed. The median surprise was a very healthy 4.35%.
"
1148,AIG,"A bull would also point to the huge increase in the number of upward estimate revisions for 2009 in response to the better-than-expected earnings. While estimate revisions activity always picks up in earnings season, the rise in the number of estimate increases absolutely swamped the rise in the number of cuts.
"
1149,AIG,"We are now past the peak of activity. Relative to a month ago, estimate increases are up 26.5%, while the number of estimate cuts has fallen by 24.4%. This has brought the revisions ratio from a negative 0.65 to a neutral/positive 1.09.
"
1150,AIG,"However, a bear would have ample ammo as well.
"
1151,AIG,"He would start by pointing out that total net income was 31.7% below year ago levels, and that the improvement relative to the fourth quarter was entirely due to one sector, the Financials. Furthermore the quality of earnings in that sector was abysmal, with billions of dollars of ""profits"" booked because the bond market had serious questions about the solvency of the firms. Also a very large portion of the increase came from one company, American International Group (AIG  -  Free Report) losing only $1.6 billion instead of losing $37.9 billion (both excluding one-time items).
"
1152,AIG,"If we look at just the 412 non-financial companies that have reported so far, total net income is actually 13.7% lower than those companies reported in the fourth quarter. A bear would also argue that companies long ago learned that it is better to under promise and over report. Additionally, we went for years with a ratio of positive surprises to disappointments of over 3:1. Thefore, the first quarter surprise ratio of 2.2:1 is not really all that great.
"
1153,AIG,"Looking ahead to the second quarter, things don't look too great, with total net income expected to be 36.4% below year ago levels. The only sector that is expected to squeak out a gain over year ago levels in the second quarter is Staples, and that is just 2.2%.
"
1154,AIG,"Eight sectors are expected to see total net income at least 25% below year ago levels. (For 5 sectors, the drop is expected to be greater than 40%.)
"
1155,AIG,"On a full-year basis, total net income is expected to drop 15.4% on the heels of a 19.3% decline in 2008. However, if the first quarter was down by 31.6%, and the second quarter is expected to be down by 36.2%, then there has to be positive year-over-year growth in the second half to bring the full year back up to just a 15.4% decline. Given the comps, expect that to happen in the fourth quarter.

"
1176,AIG,"This week, we finally broke above 1.0, indicating more estimate increases than cuts. Normally that would not be a great cause for celebration, as it really is only a neutral reading. However, when you stop banging your head against the wall, sometimes it feels good. Still there are more S&P 500 firms suffering estimate cuts than increases, but there too, the ratio is much better than it was in the winter or early spring.
"
1177,AIG,"Some of the most spectacular changes in analyst opinions have come from the retailers, as the analysts decided that reports of the death of the American consumer were premature. For example, Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report), Lowe's (LOW  -  Free Report) and Macy's (M  -  Free Report) all had at least 10 estimate increases and no cuts, and recorded increases in their mean estimates of 7.3%, 11.4% and 22.3%, respectively. I continue to think that these firms face stiff headwinds from the need of the consumers to rebuild their balance sheets, but it appears that the earlier cuts were over done.

"
1209,AIG,"The book are just about closed on first-quarter earnings season. It was a book open to many interpretations, depending on which sort of spin you want to bring to it.
"
1210,AIG,"If you were inclined to be looking for green shoots, there was ammo for your argument in that the total net income reported was far higher (more than double) in the first quarter than in the fourth quarter of 2008. A bull would also be able to point to the fact that more than twice as many firms reported earnings above expectations than those which disappointed. The median surprise was a very healthy 4.22%.
"
1211,AIG,"A bull could also point to the huge increase in the number of upward estimate revisions for 2009 in response to the better than expected earnings. While estimate revisions activity always picks up at this point in earnings season, the rise in the number of estimate increases absolutely swamped the rise in the number of cuts. Relative to a month ago, estimate increases are up 264%, while the number of estimate cuts has only increased 61%. This has brought the revisions ratio from a deeply negative 0.41 to a neutral 0.92.
"
1212,AIG,"However, a bear would have ample ammo as well. He would start by pointing out that total net income was 32.2% below year ago levels, and that the improvement relative to the fourth quarter was entirely due to one sector, the Financials. Furthermore the quality of earnings in that sector was abysmal, with billions of dollars of ""profits"" booked because the bond market had serious questions about the solvency of the firms. Also a very large portion of the increase came from one company, American International Group (AIG  -  Free Report) losing only $1.6 billion instead of losing $37.9 billion (both excluding one-time items).
"
1213,AIG,"If we look at the 394 non-financial companies, rather than all 464 firms that have reported, total net income is actually 14.7% lower than in the fourth quarter.
"
1214,AIG,"A bear would also argue that companies long ago learned that it is better to under promise and over report, and that we went for years with a ratio of positive surprises to disappointments of over 3:1, so the first quarter surprise ratio of 2.1:1 is not really all that great. The bear would also point out that there have still been more estimate cuts over the last 4 weeks than estimate increases, even if the ratio is no longer lopsided in favor of cuts.
"
1215,AIG,"All things considered, I would have to say the bears have a better argument, but it is not a slam dunk in their favor.
"
1216,AIG,"Looking ahead to the second quarter, things don't look too great, with total net income expected to be 36.2% below year ago levels. The only sector that is expected to squeak out a gain over year-ago levels in the second quarter is Staples, and that is just 3.5%. Eight sectors are expected to see total net income at least 25% below year ago levels. (Five of those sectors could see a drop of greater than 40%.)
"
1217,AIG,"For all of 2009, total net income is expected to drop 15.9% on the heels of a 20.3% decline in 2008. However, if the first quarter was down by 32.4%, and the second quarter is expected to be down by 36.2%, then there has to be positive year-over-year growth in the second half. Given the comps, expect that to happen in the fourth quarter.

A month ago, there were only 582 increases (four week moving total) and 1,423 cuts for a ratio of 0.41. Since then the number of estimate increases as almost quadrupled to 2,119, while the number of cuts has risen by only 61%, resulting in a ratio of 0.92.
"
1237,AIG,"I see this as a very significant ""glimmer of hope"". Half of the sectors are now, not just above 1.0, but into true positive territory. Telecom is extremely strong, with almost three increases for every cut. It however is a very small sector. Staples is showing an impressive 1.92 revisions ratio and Tech is not to shabby at 1.70.
"
1238,AIG,"Better than expected first quarter earnings are leading to positive estimate revisions. This is not only true for the S&P 500 as a whole but at the sector level as well.

1239,AIG,"The Telecom Charge is being lead by Sprint (S), which has seen 17 estimate increases versus no cuts over the last 4 weeks, resulting in a 53.2% increase in its mean estimate. Qwest (Q) was also impressive with a 15.8% increase it its mean estimate due to 15 increases and only one cut. Within the Tech sector, the increases were concentrated among the chip companies with especially strong performances from firms like Broadcom (BRCM), Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) and Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report).

1270,AIG,"Total Net Income Growth
"
1271,AIG,"With earnings season almost over, it looks like the Financial sector will actually post the best year-over-year growth in total net income of any sector.  However, the quality of those earnings is exceedingly poor.  By and large, the analysts have not been all that impressed, since they continue to cut their full year earnings estimates for stocks in the sector by a greater ratio, relative to increases than in any other sector.  Still, it looks like Financials will take the gold for the quarter, even if 3.1% growth would normally be nothing to write home about, especially if it was largely done with smoke and mirrors.
"
1272,AIG,"Health Care and Utilities both look to be essentially unchanged relative to a year ago, and every other sector is facing significant declines in total net income, ranging from an 8.3% drop among the Consumer Staples, to a plunge into red ink from the black among the Consumer Discretionary names that have been reported.  However, the Consumer sectors are the ones with the most firms still to report, so there is still time for them to change their rankings.  (Given the expectations for the late reporters, that seems unlikely.)
"
1273,AIG,"All told, 442 firms (88.4%) have reported total net income of $110.4 billion, a sharp drop from the $162.4 billion those same firms reported a year ago.  It is however, a very sharp improvement from the $59.1 billion they collectively earned in the fourth quarter.
"
1274,AIG,"A green shoot?  Perhaps, but more than all of the sequential improvement is due to the Financial sector, most notably a much smaller loss in the first quarter for American International Group (AIG  -  Free Report) than in the fourth quarter.
"
1275,AIG,"If we strip out the Financials, which to my mind are clearly a special case, then the 365 non-Financial firms have collectively earned a total of $91.7 billion, down 36.4% from a year ago and down 20.1% from the fourth quarter.  Just because it is a green shoot, does not mean that it is not a weed.
"
1276,AIG,"Looking at the full year expectations, every sector is expected to post lower total net income in 2009 than in 2008, with the exception of the Financials. That sector, which collectively lost money last year, is expected to be back in the black this year.
"
1277,AIG,"All told, total net income is expected to fall 15.7% in 2009, coming on the heels of an 18.9% decline last year.  This does, however, imply a bit of a second half recovery.
"
1278,AIG,"With a drop of 31.9% expected when all is said and done for the first quarter, and a 35.7% drop for the second quarter, growth would have to turn positive in the second half to get to down ""just 15.7%.  I suspect most of the earnings growth will be in the fourth quarter, due to extremely easy comparisons.  After all in the fourth quarter of 2008, earnings were down 61.8% from the fourth quarter of 2007.

1299,AIG,"While we are still seeing more estimate cuts than increases, the ratio has improved dramatically over the past month.  This has been happening on a far larger total number of revisions.

1300,AIG,"A month ago, there were only 480 increases (four week moving total) and 1,500 cuts for a ratio of 0.32.  Since then the number of estimate increases as almost quadrupled to 1,858, while the number of cuts has risen by only 46.5%, resulting in a ratio of 0.85.
"
1301,AIG,"I see this as a very significant ""glimmer of hope"".  Half of the sectors are now, not just above 1.0, but into true positive territory.
"
1302,AIG,"Telecom is extremely strong, with almost four increases for every cut.  It however is a very small sector.  Perhaps more significant is the very strong showing among the Tech firms with a ratio of 1.75.
"
1303,AIG,"Better-than-expected first-quarter earnings are leading to positive estimate revisions.  This is not only true for the S&P 500 as a whole but at the sector level as well.  Just compare the positive surprises versus disappointments in the table above with where the sectors are on the Revisions ratio rankings.
"
1304,AIG,"Not all sectors are doing well however.  The analysts continue to slash their estimates for the Financials.  It is obvious that the analysts were not impressed by the earnings among the Financials. Too be fair, there is a bit of a mixed picture among the banks, with some like Regions Financial (RF  -  Free Report) doing quite well with 11 increases and only 3 cuts (mean estimate up 26.3%), while seemingly similar firms like SunTrust (STI  -  Free Report) and KeyCorp (KEY  -  Free Report) are still seeing analysts slash away (15 and 14 cuts respectively, no increases at either and declines of more than 100%)
"
1305,AIG,"Also, despite a rally in the price of oil (now almost $58) analysts continue to cut their estimates for the Energy sector.  However, some of the biggest cuts in the Energy sector are coming from the Coal firms like CONSOL Energy (CNX  -  Free Report) and Peabody Energy (BTU).

1327,AIG,"The revisions ratio is simply divides the total number of positive estimate revisions by the total number of estimate cuts. A high ratio is a bullish indicator and a low ratio is bearish. For the S&P 500 as a whole, a number below 0.80 or above 1.25 is generally significant.
"
1328,AIG,"With smaller totals for any given sector than the S&P 500 over all, the ratio should be farther away from 1.0 to be truly significant.  However, for the sake of consistency, we refer to readings above 1.25 as being in positive territory and below 0.80 as being in negative territory.  In the average 4 week change column, we eliminate all firms where the change is either greater than =100% or less than -100%.

Also, the acquiring company’s technology-enabled business model will ease processing.The transaction strengthens AIG’s position in Life & Retirement businesses and is highly complementary to AIG’s existing UK Individual Protection offering. With Ellipse, the company will be able to gain traction from the growing group insurance market of the U.K.AIG has chosen Ellipse, driven by its superior operating performance, evident from strong growth in 2009, which made it the 6th largest UK group life provider based on its new business volumes, registered in 2017.The financial size of the transaction was left undisclosed but the deal will be funded by cash.Earlier dring the year AIG announced to acquire Validus Holdings, Ltd., a leading provider of reinsurance, primary insurance and asset management services. This transaction would strengthen its global General Insurance business by expanding the company’s current product portfolio through additional distribution channels as well as advancing the tools available to enhance underwriting.AIG had been struggling with weak business growth and has been suffering revenue declines since 2013, which persisted during the first quarter of 2018 as well. The company languished under its own weight with numerous business operations creating little or no synergy. This bearish scenario  dented the company’s profitability. Management therefore took to massive amount of divestitures, selling a number of consolidating businesses to slash costs.The stock has lost 12.4%, wider than the industry’s decline of 2.6%. The company’s CEO Brian Duperreault, appointed last year, has made a significant shift in its capital utilization strategy with a view to turn the stock around and achieve greater profitability. Management now expects to utilize capital for possible buyouts in the international markets, boosting the company’s personal and life lines segments plus investing in the domestic middle market as opposed to its hitherto usage of capital resource for share repurchases.  We will thus be little surprised to hear about more deals from the company going forward.Hence, a lower amount of share buyback will somewhat be less accretive to the company’s bottom line.AIG carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the same space are Cigna Corp. (CI  -  Free Report), MetLife, Inc. (MET  -  Free Report) and Loews Corp. (L  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Cigna has witnessed a 2.7% upward revision in current-year earnings to $13.24 over the past 60 days.MetLife beat earnings estimates in each of the last four reported quarters with an average positive surprise of 9.96%.Loews surpassed earnings estimates in three of the trailing four reported quarters with an average beat of 557.35%.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

1330,AIG,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for American International Group, Inc. (AIG  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 3.2%  in that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is AIG due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.AIG Q1 Earnings Miss Estimates & Fall Y/Y, Shares DeclineAmerican International Group Inc. reported first-quarter 2018 operating earnings of $1.04 per share that missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 16%. In the year-ago quarter, the company had reported earnings of $1.36 per share.The underperformance stemmed from the impact of huge catastrophe losses and low premium in the General Insurance as well as Life and Retirement segments.Weak Segment PerformanceGeneral Insurance Suffers From Catastrophe LossThe segment was saddled with $376 million of losses primarily related to the California mudslides, U.S. winter storms and the Papua New Guinea earthquake, as well as $135 million of severe losses that led to an underwriting loss of $251 million compared with $12 million of underwriting income in the year-ago quarter.Net premium written of $6.2 billion was also down 2% year over year due to the net impact of the company’s reinsurance program and the strategic portfolio actions in U.S. Casualty and Property.Combined ratio of 103.8% deteriorated a massive 400 basis points year over year, primarily due to an increase in loss ratio, which stemmed from huge catastrophe losses.Disappointing Life and Retirement Unit ResultsPremium and fees of $1.18 billion decreased 23% year over year, led by an 80% decline in contribution from the Institutional Market sub segment.Pre-tax income, was also down 1% from the prior-year quarter to $892 million.Share RepurchaseIn the first quarter, AIG repurchased 5.4 million common shares for $298 million and warrants for $2 million. As of May 2, 2018, approximately $2.0 billion remained under the share repurchase authorization.Financial PositionAt the end of the first quarter, the insurer’s adjusted book value per share (excluding AOCI) was $56.10, up 2.5% from the Dec 31, 2017 level.Core adjusted return on equity (ROE) was 8.6%, down 160 basis points year over year.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. There have been five revisions lower for the current quarter.American International Group, Inc. Price and Consensus  American International Group, Inc.

1331,AIG,"The A2 insurance financial strength (IFS) rating of the UK-based AIG Europe Limited (AIGEL), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of American International Group, Inc. (AIG  -  Free Report), has been affirmed by Moody’s Investors Service, the rating arm of Moody’s Corporation.The rating agency has additionally assigned provisional IFS ratings of (P) A2 to the newly established indirect AIG subsidiaries namely, UK-based American International Group UK Limited (AIG UK) and Luxembourg-based AIG Europe S.A. (AESA). The outlook remains stable.Reasons Behind the RatingsMoody’s ratings for the P & C insurer AIGEL, reflect its strong market position in the UK commercial lines, its broad product portfolio offered in Europe, its investment strategy as well as the support provided by its affiliates. However, these positives are partially offset by the company’s weak operating results in recent years, catastrophe loss, adverse loss development reserve and its relatively high gross underwriting leverage.AIGEL is working on its operating performance by shifting resources toward more profitable segments and tightening policy limits along with reducing expenses and using more reinsurance to decrease volatility.AIGEL’s stable outlook is based on the rating agency view that the unit’s underwriting and reserve volatility will be lowered to such an extent that it will improve its combined ratio to less than 100%.AIG UK is expected to write commercial lines such as property, liability, special risks and financial lines for multinational, national and middle market clients based on AIGEL’s current operations.Meanwhile, AESA will not only have a majority of its business in commercial lines but will also write a significant proportion of consumer lines like personal accident, extended warranty and private client coverages. The rating giant expects the companies to be sold through global and regional brokers as well as via smaller agents and other such channels.Moody’s provisional ratings on AIG UK and AESA prove that the agency anticipates both the company’s arms to get explicit and implicit support from affiliates. This backing is likely to include reinsurance ceded to AIG's flagship P&C operations in the United States, AIG Property Casualty U.S., Inc. (AIG PC US, IFS rating A2 stable) and capital available from AIG parent.The agency hopes to assign definitive IFS ratings to AESA and AIG UK just when AIGEL deicides to transfer its business to the same entities, which is scheduled for Dec 1, 2018.What can Lead to Ratings Upgrade or Downgrade?The factors likely leading to a rating upgrade for AIGEL, AIG UK and AESA include increase in underwriting results and profitability, a favorable or benign development of loss reserves, gross underwriting leverage below 3.5x and an upgrade of the AIG PC US rating.And the aspects, which might cause a rating downgrade for AIGEL, AIG UK and AESA, are continuous soft underwriting results, further adverse loss development reserve and losses possibly rendering a decline in the capital by more than 10% in a year.Shares of this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) have lost 17.50%, wider than the industry’s decline of 3.39% in the past year. Stocks to ConsiderA few better-ranked stocks from the same space are Kemper Corporation ((KMPR  -  Free Report), MetLife, Inc. (MET  -  Free Report) and Loews Corporation (L  -  Free Report).Kemper is a diversified insurance holding company, providing property and casualty, and life and health insurance in the United States.

1332,AIG,"American International Group Inc. (AIG  -  Free Report) aims to expand its presence in the pension risk transfer market via agreement on the two largest plan termination transactions of 2017.These transactions, entered into by American General Life Insurance Company, part of AIG’s Life & Retirement business, represented over $1.5 billion in pension plan obligations covering more than 24,000 retirees, beneficiaries, deferred and active members.Tax reform, repatriation of assets from international operations and improved funded status provides significant opportunity for expansion of the pension risk transfer market.The company is one of the leaders in the thriving pension risk transfer market given its investment expertise, strong operational capabilities, prudent risk management, disciplined pricing and strong balance sheet.Pension risk transfer is in demand as corporations are de-risking their pension liabilities in order to lower risk profile and focus on their core business.Pension obligations pose threats to the company’s equity capital in the event of market disruption. Unfunded pension liabilities are a form of corporate debt, which has to be settled before paying to equity shareholders. Any loss in pension fund causes would inflate the pension fund liability which would erode shareholder’s equity and weigh on capital levels.These risks have increased the popularity of pension risk transfer agreements which enable corporations to delegate the management of their pension liabilities to an insurer for some fees These agreements thus enable companies to focus on their business growth without worrying about pension liability.Other big insurers Prudential Financial Inc. (PRU  -  Free Report) and MetLife Inc. (MET  -  Free Report) are also eying this growing market. Earlier this month, a unit of MetLife agreed to assume responsibility for about $6 billion in defined benefit pension obligations for 41,000 retirees and beneficiaries in FedEx pension plans.Also, a unit of Prudential Financial agreed to assume responsibility for about $1.2 billion in pension obligations to 7,500 pensioners from Pension Insurance Corp. PLC of the United Kingdom.American International revenues have suffered over the years from declining premium due to disciplined underwriting, competitive market conditions and reduction in business due to numerous divestitures taken.This is evident from declining revenues since 2013 that continued in the first quarter of 2018. Challenges in the property and casualty market, and continued business dispositions will continue to keep the top-line under pressure in the coming quarters.The stock has declined 15% in a year’s time compared with the industry’s growth of 0.5%.The company’s new CEO Brian Duperreault is expected to be instrumental in turning around the company by completing ongoing restructuring initiatives and making additional changes.American International Group carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). A better-ranked stock in the space is Kemper Corporation (KMPR  -  Free Report). The stock sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

1333,AIG,"After nearly collapsing during the financial crisis in 2008, American International Group (AIG  -  Free Report) was once of the most high-profile beneficiaries of U.S. government intervention in the Troubled Asset Relief Program, commonly referred to as TARP.Having decided that the failure of AIG, with its large and diverse basket of assets and liabilities would cause catastrophic damage to the U.S. financial system and economy, the U.S. became AIG’s largest shareholder, at one point owning 61% of the company’s shares.  The program mandated significant changes to AIG’s structure, including a new corporate  governance structure, and a reduction in exposure to risky derivative securities.By 2012, the U.S. Treasury and federal Reserve had not only recouped all of the $182 billion they had staked to the bailout, but after selling all of its remaining shares, actually posted a profit of nearly $23 billion on the transaction.Thanks to the austerity measures levied on the company while under government ownership, AIG has never returned to the high-flying status it enjoyed before the crisis.As the table above shows, the size of the company was cut by nearly 50% in terms of assets and its exposure to derivatives was lowered by over 90%.Although a much safer and more stable company, the huge insurer is a mere shadow if its former self in terms of profits.  Even in an environment of low interest rates, a rising stock market and softening regulations that should benefit financial companies, AIG has underperformed, with shares up just 34% in the past 5 years versus an average of better than 50% for the insurance industry. 2018 has been even worse, with the stock down 7% YTD.AIG has missed earning estimates in the past 3 quarters, most recently reporting a profit of $1.04/share in Q1, well short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.24.Analyst expectations have been falling and the full year 2018 estimate, now stands at $4.95/share, down from $5.67 90 days ago, thanks to 8 recent downgrades.  AIG is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).In  poor sign for the company, AIG suffered outsize losses in 2017, especially in its European unit, with CEO Anthony Baldwin commenting “…our performance was impacted by a combination of natural catastrophes, continued competitive pressure and low investment returns.”In response, AIG has taken steps to reduce volatility by lowering risk limits and improving risk selection.  Unfortunately, insurance companies don’t make money by avoiding risk, they profit from taking risks -provided that they are priced correctly.  The reduction in exposure will likely means that AIG’s erning will stagnate for the foreseeable future.Investors interested in insurance companies should instead consider Aegon NV (AEG  -  Free Report) or the Kemper Corporation (KMPR  -  Free Report), both Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside? Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana. Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

1334,AIG,"The Finance sector, which has been in the spotlight since the U.S. Presidential elections in November 2016, reported impressive first-quarter 2018 results. Per the latest Earnings Preview, the S&P 500 finance stocks recorded 24.7% year-over-year earnings improvement. This was mainly driven by favorable macroeconomic factors, higher interest rates, decent loan and deposit growth, and lower tax rates.So far this year, the Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLF  -  Free Report), which tracks the overall S&P Financial Select Sector Index, is up nearly 1.2%. The bullish trend is expected to continue, going forward.Performance of finance sector is directly related to the healthy of the economy. Per the ‘advance’ estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, real GDP increased 2.3% in first-quarter 2018. Driven by this favorable backdrop, performance of finance sector stocks will likely improve further as the U.S. economy continues to gain strength.Additionally, the Federal Reserve’s hawkish stance will support the stocks’ financials. Barring REITs, the other components of the Finance sector — banks, brokerage firms, asset managers and insurers — benefit from higher rates. The steeper yield curve helps the financial stocks to improve revenues.Moreover, as the bill on rolling back of the 2010 Dodd-Frank legislation is expected to become a law soon, finance stocks are expected to reap benefits. The bill is aimed at lowering compliance costs and hence will help boost profitability.Apart from these, the new tax legislation will lower effective tax rates for almost all finance sector stocks. This will, thus, enable them to earn more profit. Reduced tax rates are expected to provide further stimulus to the economy, therefore indirectly to the finance sector.Despite these positive factors, there are quite a few finance stocks that are not expected to perform well, mostly owing to some fundamental weaknesses. So, one should reassess portfolio holdings in the light of the present environment and dump the worst performing stocks right away.5 Finance Sector Stocks to AvoidSelecting stocks to dump could be a bit tricky. However, with the assistance of the Zacks Stock Screener, one can locate stocks with a red flag.One could begin by selecting stocks that have lost more than 5% value year to date. Further, stocks that witnessed downward estimate revisions (over the past four weeks) for the current year are likely to plunge the most and should be dumped.Additionally, these stocks have a market cap of $3 billion or more.

1336,AIG,"U.S. stock markets witnessed a choppy session on Thursday. In the initial hours of trading all three indexes entered the negative territory. However, indexes recovered most of their losses over the rest of the trading session. Finally, S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite ended in the red while the Dow managed to gain marginally. Uncertainty about the Fed’s future plans, concerns regarding an impending trade war and weak earnings results fueled market volatility.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) closed at 23,930.15, increased by a marginal 5.17 points. However, the S&P 500 Index (INX) decreased 0.2% to close at 2,629.73. The Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 7,088.15, also decreasing 0.2%. A total of 7.56 billion shares were traded on Thursday, higher than the last 20-session average of 6.61 billion shares. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1.36 -to-1 ratio. On the Nasdaq, decliners had an edge over advancers by 1.80 to -1 ratio.The CBOE VIX decreased 0.4% and closed at 15.90, after touching 18.53 (up nearly 16%) in the early hours of trading. This was the biggest one day jump of Wall Street’s fear index since April 6.How Did the Benchmarks Perform?The Dow gained 5.17 points by the end of trading reversing he spate of losses suffered over the last four successive sessions. However, the blue-chip index was down by 393 points in the early hours of trading and fell below its 200-day moving average at 23,750.30. Finally, the index recovered its losses and closed above this psychological barrier. Notably, 19 of the 30-stocks in the index closing in the red while 11 traded in the green.The S&P 500 decreased 0.2% led by 0.9% decline of both the Healthcare Select Sector SPDR (XLV) and the Financials Select Sector SPDR (XLF). Notably, 7 out of 10 sectors of the benchmark index ended in negative territory. In the initial hours of trading the benchmark index was down as much as 1.6% breaking below its 200-day moving average. The index recovered most of its lost ground but still closed in the red.The Nasdaq Composite lost 0.2% after dropping more than 1% during the trading session. Strong performance by large-cap tech stocks helped the tech-laden index to make up for most of its losses, in the final hour of trading.Uncertainty Regarding Fed’s Policy  As inflation touches the Fed’s target level of 2%, the market is expecting any of the two strategies from the central bank. The central bank may raise the magnitude of benchmark interest rate or it may increase the number of interest rate hikes in 2018. It may also speed up the winding down of its bond purchases further.However, the central bank did not provide any clear-cut indication about its future monetary policy after its recently concluded meeting. Industry watchers and economists are divided about the Fed’s future moves regarding the pace of rate increases. Higher interest rate will raise cost of funds for both corporate and individual and will strengthen the dollar affecting U.S exports.Trade War Fear Looms LargeTrade war fear remain heightened even though a high-level delegation led by the U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will meet Chinese counterparts this week to negotiate trade related disputes.Meanwhile, President Trump is contemplating issuing an executive order to restrict select Chinese telecommunications equipment makers from selling products in the United States.Weak Earnings Results On Thursday, several large companies posted weak earnings results in an otherwise extremely strong first-quarter earnings session.Shares of American International Group Inc.

1338,AIG,"The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. (HIG  -  Free Report) has recently launched an admitted cyber liability product named, CyberChoice First Response to address the cyberattacks suffered by the businesses. This initiative comes with an objective to lower the damages caused to the company’s profitability and reputations due to a spate of cyberattacks.The New OfferingCyberChoice First Response helps businesses combat cyberattack challenges like data privacy and network security, media, ransomware and business interruption with complete opportunity of customization. The product would also enable the company to track down and respond to cyber threats.Provision of coverage for pre-claim expenses, recognition of internal expenses incurred due to a breach, 24/7 cyber incident hotline assistance, protection against system failure and administrative error are some of the major features of the product. CyberChoice First Response would also offer coverage, related to a regulatory inquiry plus regulatory fines and defense as well as expenses incurred on a regulatory proceeding.The new product provides business owners with vital access to a guidance panel of pre-approved service providers, who could assist to secure the invaded networks with their expert advice and know-how. For customers, Hartford Financial offers a digital cyber risk management portal called The Hartford Cyber Center, which equips customers with tools, training materials and suggestions on best practices to mitigate the cyber intrusion risks.Rationale Behind the LaunchThe failure to protect information of the policyholders costs insurers millions in terms of fines and other costs. A report by Accenture plc (ACN  -  Free Report) states that insurance companies experience 113 cyberattacks on an average every year with one out of three successfully inflicting serious data violation. This not only hurts a company’s underwriting results but also causes loss.Management at Hartford Financial believes that CyberChoice First Response is a comprehensive insurance solution to provide insurers and their clients with complete coverage on the rapidly changing landscape of cyber threats.The responsibility of the new product does not end once the claim is resolved but it also offers post-incident coverage to enable a business improve its overall security position prepared beforehand against possible cyberattacks.Initiatives by Other PlayersWith the average cost of a data breach exceeding $3 million, insurers are proactively adopting new technologies to protect their clients and customers.Earlier this April, Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company (WLTW  -  Free Report), a leading insurance broker, launched the latest version of its innovative Cyber Risk Profile Diagnostic tool, which allows organizations to identify and analyze risk prone areas of cyber exposure and vulnerability by measuring the respective current cyber maturity.Last December, American International Group, Inc. (AIG  -  Free Report) announced a new cyber benchmarking model, which quantifies and scores client cyber risk.Share Price PerformanceHartford Financial’s relentless efforts to ensure customer satisfaction have therefore helped it gain shareholders’ appreciation.

1339,AIG,"The U.S. Insurance Industry faced challenges in 2017 that put pressure on the deal-making environment to a large extent. Starting from a tepid economic environment to extremely unpredictable weather conditions, the insurance industry bore the brunt of all. Despite these trials, the industry still managed to complete 350 mergers and acquisitions (M&A) in the year per a report by the London-based law, firm Clyde &Co. Even though the above-mentioned deal volume was considerably lower than the previous year, the same is anticipated to rise in 2018.Interestingly, the last couple of years has set the stage for insurers to take an aggressive and positive approach toward the deal-making environment in 2018, mainly driven by an evolving industry and M&A environment.With the gradually stabilizing economy and rising interest rates along with a buoyed investor and consumer confidence, the insurance industry has been putting in conscious efforts to complete a greater number of consolidations this year. This in turn will also help insurers achieve strategic objectives, more so because the M&A route essentially paves the way for attaining growth.Driving Factors for a Positive M&A LandscapeThe recent tax reform, effective Jan 1, 2018, reducing the tax rate to 21% from 35% and thus calling for a $1.5-trillion tax cut, is expected to benefit the insurance industry to a large extent. Besides redesigning taxation to make U.S. insurers more competitive globally, the tax overhaul provides a few changes to make the M&A environment more conducive.Further, technology will provide an impetus to insurers to likely drive M&A growth in 2018. Technology will also help the insurance companies develop new products, enhance client base and loyalty, boost distribution strategies as well as propel efficiencies. Considering the strategic need for technology investments, InsurTech has risen to prominence in the industry. Hence, acquiring technology assets is set to be a tactical driver for deals in 2018, despite the small size of such deals.On the back of continued capital inflow, the insurance industry’s available capital resource remains at an all-time high, which has helped insurers build a strong liquidity profile. A robust capital position will lend enough support to insurers to pursue bigger and important deals in the near term, also keeping the industry’s growth trend alive.Also, with the probability of alternative sources of capital flowing into new areas, beyond the traditional business lines, there will be additional pressure on pricing leading to some businesses available for sale.Additionally, divesting noncore assets for competitive and regulatory concerns, is being considered by many insurers. Through this process, the strategies of such companies will come into focus, resulting in shedding of more business lines this year.A Few Noteworthy Deals So Far This YearThe insurance industry witnessed some high-profile deals being announced and accomplished in the past couple of months. For instance, on Jan 22, 2018, American International Group, Inc. (AIG  -  Free Report) decided to buy reinsurer Validus Holdings, Ltd. (VR) for $5.6 billion in cash. The buyout is anticipated to be immediately accretive to American International Group’s earnings and return on equity (ROE).This apart, a milestone decision was taken by AXA Group on Mar 5, 2018 to acquire 100% of XL Group Ltd (XL  -  Free Report) for $15.3 billion and creating the leading global property and casualty (P&C) Commercial lines insurer based on gross written premiums.Another such deal refers to Fidelity National Financial, Inc.’s agreement (FNF  -  Free Report) to acquire Stewart Information Services Corporation (STC) for $1.2 billion in a cash-stock deal on Mar 19, 2018. The transaction is expected to culminate in the first or second quarter of 2019, subject to closing conditions.Stocks in FocusThe insurance industry is pretty certain that the M&A activity will be back in form this year, mostly attributable to the factors discussed above as well the concerns regarding a soft economic climate and fast-changing regulations starting to diminish.We have zeroed in on four outperforming stocks in the thriving insurance industry with a promise to generate better returns despite all odds based on price performance, positive estimate revisions, a favorable Zacks Rank and an impressive Growth Score of A or B.

1341,AIG,"Major benchmarks hit record highs on Monday after the Senate gave its consent to pass a Bill that ends the current government shutdown. Meanwhile, biotech sector rallied following major biotech merger deals. This led the Nasdaq higher which ended at a record. The Dow and the S&P also ended in record territory.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) increased 0.6%, to close at 26,214.60. The S&P 500 rose 0.8% to close at 2,832.97. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 7,408.03, gaining 1%. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) decreased 3.6% to close at 10.87. A total of around 6.56 billion shares were traded on Monday, higher than the last 20-session average of 6.34 billion shares. Advancers outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 1.70-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 1.38-to-1 ratio favored advancing issues.Biotech ETF Surges, Pushes Nasdaq HigherThe iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (IBB) surged 3.1% on Monday following a couple of merger deals in the biotech sector worth billions of dollars. Touted to be the largest biotech ETF, iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology is trading at its highest levels since October 2017.Shares of Juno Therapeutics, Inc.  skyrocketed 26.8% on Monday after it entered into an agreement with Celgene Corp.

The House had already passed a one-month spending Bill on Jan 18 to keep the government funded up until Feb 16, 2018. However, the Bill did not find much favor in the Senate and therefore could not reach the 60-vote mark to clear the Senate. The Senate adjourned without further voting for a final outcome on Thursday.The funding to keep the government funded ended on Saturday, leading to a shutdown. This shutdown stretched through Monday after lawmakers in the United States failed to reach a resolution on the issue. This was due to negotiations related to immigrations, discussions over which bothered the Republican-led Congress for most of Sunday.Stocks That Made HeadlinesAIG to Buy Validus, Expand Reach in Reinsurance BusinessAmerican International Group Inc. (AIG  -  Free Report) has agreed to buy Bermuda based reinsurer, Validus Holdings Ltd.

"
1352,AIG,"We are off and running on the first-quarter earnings season with the traditional kick-off by Alcoa, Inc. (AA), which incurred a penalty by kicking it out of bounds with a loss of $470 million.
"
1353,AIG,"While we are still very early in the season, with just 27 or 5.4% of all firms reporting, the start has been rocky. Total net income is off 23.5% from a year ago versus an 11.4% drop last quarter. Granted this is far from a representative sample, but it does not seem to be a good omen.
"
1354,AIG,"The big upward surge we saw in the financials expectations for the quarter backed off a bit, but will probably resume given Thursday's announcement from Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report). (Revisions related to the announcement are reflected in the data). Excluding provisions for bad existing loans, the banks should be very profitable given the steep yield curve and the refinance boom. However, provisions are a mighty big exclusion. The shirt in mark-to-market rules though may give banks cover to avoid adequate provisioning. The pass through of the American International Group (AIG  -  Free Report) bailout funds will also greatly help on that front as well.
"
1355,AIG,"Looking at the total picture of both companies that have reported and expectations for those that have not shows expectations for total net income being down 28.7% from a year ago. That is a big improvement from the 62.0% decline in the fourth-quarter, but is hardly good news.
"
1356,AIG,"A very big part of the fourth-quarter decline was drive by exceptionally large losses at a handful of financial firms, most notably Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) and AIG. It seems unlikely that AIG will post anything like the loss it saw in the fourth quarter.
"
1357,AIG,"For most stocks the year-over-year decline in net income is likely to be steeper in the first quarter than it was in the fourth quarter. Seven of the 10 sectors are expected to post a bigger drop this quarter. The exceptions are Financials, Materials and Consumer Discretionary. All 3 were absolute disasters in the fourth quarter, and for Materials and Discretionary this will be a very ugly quarter, but just slightly better than the fourth quarter.
"
1358,AIG,"Looking at full-year projections, total net income is expected to fall 12.2% following an 18.9% decline in 2008. Most sectors are expected to post far worse results for the year than last year, with the cyclical areas expected to be hit the hardest, particularly the commodity sensitive Materials and Energy sectors. Keep in mind though that those firms were printing money early in 2008.

"
1366,AIG,"Only 27 firms have reported their first quarter results. The ratio of positive surprises to disappointments stands at 1.55:1, while in recent years it has regularly been well over 3:1. The median surprise is 2.87%, which is closer to historical norms. These figures will be very volatile in the early going and may change significantly by the time earnings season is over.
"
1367,AIG,"The positive surprises have been concentrated in the Discretionary sector, and it is the only sector to show positive year-over-year growth in median EPS. The rest of the sector is not expected to fare as well, with a median EPS decline of 28.6% expected. Then again low expectations make it easier to have a positive surprise.
"
1368,AIG,"Excluding that sector disappointments are beating positive surprises by almost 2:1. These are mostly still firms with February fiscal ends, and are not a very representative sample.

"
1378,AIG,"The Telecom sector was the only one with more increases than cuts, but the sample size is so small (16 total) that it really is not that significant. The Consumer Discretionary sector has improved significantly, most likely in response to the better than expected earnings for the early reporters in the sector.
"
1379,AIG,"The dramatic improvement in the total net income expectations for the Financial sector in the first quarter has not been matched to a flood of estimate increases for the full year.

"
1389,AIG,"The 2010 revisions ratio story is pretty much the same as 2009. A gradual pattern of a low but improving revisions ratio was slightly reversed this week. In a bit of a surprise, the total number of revisions actually grew this week, counter the normal seasonal pattern.
"
1390,AIG,"The very small Telecom sector (15 total revisions) is the best on a relative basis, but nothing to really write home about. The Consumer Discretionary sector has also improved significantly in recent weeks, as has the Consumer Staples sector. The Health Care sector has been fading.
"
1391,AIG,"As with 2009, the Industrials sector was far and away the weakest, with Financials, Energy and Materials also very weak. However, in recent weeks the price of oil has started to rebound. If that holds, it seems likely that the estimates could start to head up again for the energy sector. As it stands now, the size of the cuts in the sector is very large.

"
1405,AIG,"Total Net Income Growth
"
1406,AIG,"The big news this week is the massive upward revision in the first-quarter earnings expectations for the Financials. In total, the sector is expected to earn than $3 billion more this week in the first quarter than forecasts predicted a week ago. Most of the increase is attributable to the mega banks like J.P. Morgan (JPM  -  Free Report), Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) and Citigroup (C  -  Free Report).
"
1407,AIG,"Changes in the mark to market rules (well the anticipation of the changes, the actual change is to recent to be captured by these numbers) is likely the biggest reason. If so, then it is mostly a change in the accounting earnings, not the economic earnings.
"
1408,AIG,"The other explanation is that passing through of American International Group, Inc. (AIG  -  Free Report) bailout money to these large banks by settling their CDS exposures in full. That gift from the taxpayers would be a real economic benefit bank bottom lines.
"
1409,AIG,"While the sector as a whole is still expected to earn less than it did a year ago, the magnitude of the decline has been cut dramatically, to just a 9.0% drop from an expected 27.2% decline just last week. This has caused the expected decline in the total earnings for the S&P 500 as a whole to also moderate significantly, with a 27.5% drop expected now vs. a 37.2% decline forecast just last week.
"
1410,AIG,"We just have a relative handful of actual earnings reports in for the first quarter, all of them firms with February fiscal period ends. As such it is far from a representative sample. However, the 21 firms that have collectively earned a total of $5.1 billion, a 11.9% drop from the $5.8 billion they earned in the first quarter of 2008. Quite surprisingly the Consumer Durables sector is doing very well, posting a 22.2% increase in total net income so far. Every other sector has total net income below last year, but the sample size is far too small to draw any real conclusions.
"
1411,AIG,"For the full year, earnings estimates continue to be cut for both 2009 and 2010. The negative revisions continue to out pace increases by more than a
"
1412,AIG,"3:1 ratio for both years, but that is better than what we were seeing a few months ago when the margin was more like 5:1. On the other hand, the improvement is happening on a very light volume of total estimate revisions (seasonally normal), so the improvement has as much to do with old cuts falling off the four week running totals as it does with new increases being made.

"
1416,AIG,"The results over the last week have been better than expected and the surprise ratio has jumped to 2:1 from an even 1:1 last week. The Consumer Discretionary sector has a perfect record so far with 8 results in and 8 positive surprises. Those firms have generated median EPS growth of 15.8%, and a median surprise of 18.9%. The remaining firms in the sector are not expected to fare as well, with a median EPS of 27.3% expected. But then again, that is what makes for surprises.
"
1417,AIG,"Health Care is the only sector currently expected to post better year-over-year EPS than a year ago, The Utilities are expected to be flat and Consumer Staples is only expected to see a negligible decline. Beyond that the expectations start getting very ugly, with 6 of the sectors expected to post median drops of over 20%.
"
1418,AIG,"Materials and Energy are expected to see drops of over 40%. Those two sectors however are facing very difficult comps. Remember just how much the oil companies were making last year, well other commodities were also doing very well then as well.

1425,AIG,"Estimate activity nearing seasonal low  The revisions ratio reversed a gradual uptrend it had been in for several weeks, and remains in very negative territory. Generally we consider anything below 0.80 to be negative, and anything above 1.25 to be positive.
"
1426,AIG,"Only health Care has made into neutral territory. The overall pace of estimate revisions is slowing dramatically, as it usually does after earnings season is over. The revisions ratio is based on the four week moving totals of estimate changes. Thus the rise in the ratio may have more to do with old estimate cuts falling off faster than old estimate increases than it does with new estimate revisions.
"
1427,AIG,"The Telecom sector was the only one with more increases than cuts, but the sample size is so small (19 total) that it really is not that significant.
"
1428,AIG,"The Consumer Discretionary sector has improved significantly, most likely in response to the better than expected earnings for the early reporters in the sector. The dramatic improvement in the total net income expectations for the Financial sector in the first quarter has not been matched to a flood of estimate increases for the full year, which should make you suspicious of how real the improvement really is. The Industrial sector is an absolute mess, with cuts out pacing increases by a margin of over 40:1.

"
1434,AIG,"The very small Telecom sector (23 total revisions) and Health Care the best on a relative basis, but nothing to really write home about. The Consumer Discretionary sector has also improved significantly in recent weeks.  As with 2009, the Industrials sector was far and away the weakest, with Financials, Energy and Materials also very weak. However, in recent days the price of oil has started to rebound. If that holds, it seems likely that the estimates could start to head up again for the Energy sector. As it stands now, the size of the cuts in the sector is very large.

1443,AIG,"Despite another discouraging jobs report, stocks ended the week on a high note once again, capping off 4 consecutive weeks of gains. The Dow has not seen such a 4-week trend since September and October of 2007, when the blue chip index hit an all-time high.

"
1445,AIG,"Unemployment hit 8.5% in March, the highest level since 1983. The number of jobs eliminated totaled 663,000, slightly worse than forecasts of 650,000 and Februarys 651,000.
"
1446,AIG,"The service sector saw more contraction in March, the 6th straight month of tightening. The Institute for Supply Managements (ISM) services index dipped to a reading 40.8 from Februarys 41.6. The result fell short of analysts expectations. A reading below 50 signals weakness.

(AIG  -  Free Report). 
"
1449,AIG,"However, he also stated that the current plan to ease financial woes is working, and the Fed will continue to use quantitative easing, or credit easing, to infuse more liquidity into financial markets.

1463,AIG,"Total Net Income Growth
"
1464,AIG,"As total earnings estimate activity wanes due to the end of the earnings season, and old estimates drop off our 4-week moving totals, the revisions ratios have started to rebound, and with them the number of huge mean estimate declines. However, make no mistake, the direction of estimates is still down, just at a some what slower pace.
"
1465,AIG,"Looking ahead to the first quarter, every sector is expected to see a decline in total net income relative to the first quarter of 2008. For 8 of the sectors, the year over year declines are expected to be worse than the fourth quarter.
"
1466,AIG,"All told, a 35.3% year over year decline is currently expected. The only exceptions are the Financial and Materials sectors. While the Financials may break back into the black this quarter, and a year ago was not exactly a boom time for the sector, I suspect that they will do much worse than the 26.2% decline forecast. As for the Materials, its hard to get to excited about a 80.1% decline in earnings, even if that is not as bad as an 80.2% decline.
"
1467,AIG,"The early read on the second quarter is downbeat, with a 31.0% year over year decline expected. Consumer Staples are expected to post a slight gain in total net income, and the Health Care and Utilities sectors are expected to have only minor declines. Easy year ago comps will help keep the decline in the Consumer Discretionary sector to ""just 19.2%"". All other sectors are expected to see drops of more than 25%.
"
1468,AIG,"Looking at the full year data, the Financial sector is expected to return to profitability. Even though both the 2008 and 2009 numbers show negatives of over 100%, they mean very different things. In 2008 the sector went to a negative from a positive, and in 2009 the sector is expected to go to a positive from a negative. Mathematically it does not make any difference which direction you head through zero, but economically it sure does.
"
1469,AIG,"Mostly as a result of the expected rebound in the Financials (let us prey that there are no more massive losses like Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) and American International Group, Inc. (AIG  -  Free Report) posted in 2008) the total net income for the S&P 500 is only expected to fall 10.9% in 2009, after a 19.0% decline in 2008. Just because the entire sector is expected to not lose money in aggragate, it does not mean that they are going to be in good shape.
"
1470,AIG,"Aside from the special case of the Financials, this is shaping up to be a very bad year for earnings. For 8 of the 10 sectors, things are expected to be significantly worse in 2009 than in 2008. Or as is the case with 5 of the sectors, they saw earnings grow in 2008 and are now expected to see them decline in 2009.

Median results can jump around quite a bit in the early going, so these are just very tentative clues as to the direction of the quarter. In some ways it is likely to get even worse than the current numbers show.

"
1489,AIG,"The revisions ratio reversed a gradual uptrend it had been in for several weeks, and remains in very negative territory. Generally we consider anything below 0.80 to be negative, and anything above 1.25 to be positive. Only health Care has made into neutral territory.
"
1490,AIG,"The overall pace of estimate revisions is slowing dramatically, as it usually does after earnings season is over. Since the revisions ratio is based on the 4-week moving totals of estimate changes, the rise in the ratio may have more to do with old estimate cuts falling off than it does with new estimate revisions.
"
1491,AIG,"The revisions picture, while still quite negative, has improved significantly in recent weeks for the Technology sector. Telecom is also relatively strong, but that is based on a small sample size of estimate revisions. On the downside, the Industrials sector is looking particularly weak with over 17 cuts for every increase. That is far worse than even the perpetual estimate revision cellar dweller, the Financials, where cuts outnumber increases by less than 5:1.
"
1492,AIG,"Keep in mind, that after an earnings season is over, the total number of revisions always falls. The revisions ratios are based on 4-week moving totals of estimate revisions. Thus when the total number of revisions is falling, changes in the revisions ratios are affected more by old estimate changes falling out of the totals as by new estimate changes being made.

"
1501,AIG,"The very small Telecom sector (23 total revisions) and Health Care the best on a relative basis, but nothing to really write home about. The Consumer Discretionary sector has also improved significantly in recent weeks, but still faces more than two cuts for each increase.  As with 2009, the Industrials sector was far and away the weakest, with Financials, Energy and Materials also very weak. However, in recent days the price of oil has started to rebound. If that holds, it seems likely that the estimates could start to head up again for the energy sector. As it stands now, the size of the cuts in the sector is very large.

"
1522,AIG,"Total Net Income Growth
"
1523,AIG,"As total earnings estimate activity wanes due to the end of the earnings season, and old estimates drop off our 4-week moving totals, the revisions ratios have started to rebound, and with them the number of huge mean estimate declines. However, make no mistake, the direction of estimates is still down, just at a some what slower pace.
"
1524,AIG,"The fourth-quarter earnings season, is completely finished, and good riddance. It was an unmitigated disaster, especially on a total net income basis. Things are not, however likely to improve that much in the first quarter. Sure it is unlikely that American International Group (AIG  -  Free Report) will drop another $61 billion (or the adjusted $35 billion used in our calculations), but a total net income decline of 35.3% from a year ago is still very ugly.
"
1525,AIG,"However, Financials were not alone in seeing huge drops in net income. Only 2 sectors, the defensive Health Care and Staples sectors, managed to post higher total net income than a year ago, and neither by double digits. Utilities took the bronze for the quarter due to just a fractional decline in total income. Both the Financial and Consumer Discretionary sectors lost money as a whole in the fourth quarter. Materials saw their total earnings drop by over 80%
"
1526,AIG,"Looking ahead to the first quarter, every sector is expected to see a decline in total net income relative to the first quarter of 2008. For 8 of the sectors, the year-over-year declines are expected to be worse than the fourth quarter. All told, a 35.3% year-over-year decline is currently expected.
"
1527,AIG,"The only exceptions are the Financial and Materials sectors. While the Financials may break back into the black this quarter, I suspect that they will do much worse than the 21.8% decline currenly forecast. As for the Materials, it's hard to get to excited about a 72% decline in earnings, even if that is not as bad as an 80% decline. The early read on the second quarter is also downbeat, with a 29.2% decline expected.
"
1528,AIG,"Consumer Staples are expected to post a slight gain in total net income, and the Health Care and Utilities sectors are expected to have only minor declines. Easy year ago comps will help keep the decline in the Consumer Discretionary sector to ""just 19.2%"". All other sectors are expected to see drops of more than 25%.
"
1529,AIG,"Looking at the full year data, the Financial sector is expected to return to profitability. Even though both the 2008 and 2009 numbers show negatives of over 100%, they mean very different things. In 2008 the sector went to a negative from a positive, and in 2009 the sector is expected to go to a positive from a negative. Mathematically it does not make any difference which direction you head through zero, but economically it sure does.
"
1530,AIG,"Mostly as a result of the expected rebound in the Financials (let us prey that there are no more massive losses like Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) and AIG posted in 2008) the total net income for the S&P 500 (SPX) is only expected to fall 10.3% in 2009, after a 18.9% decline in 2008.
"
1531,AIG,"However, for 8 of the 10 sectors, things are expected to be significantly worse in 2009 than in 2008. Not only is the total net income expected to be lower, but the size of the decline is expected to be larger in 2009 than in 2008. Or as is the case with 5 of the sectors, they saw earnings grow in 2008 and are now expected to see them decline in 2009.

"
1539,AIG,"Based on the early results, it looks like we might be in for another tough quarter. Normally positive earnings surprises far exceed earnings disappointments, but so far they are equal. Median results can jump around quite a bit in the early going, so these are just very tentative clues as to the direction of the quarter. In some ways it is likely to get even worse than the current numbers show.
"
1540,AIG,"While the 11 that have already reported are showing a median EPS decline of 9.2%, the remaining 489 firms are expected to post a drop of 20.0%. The only sector that is expected to post positive EPS growth is Health Care. Utilities, Staples and Telecom are expected to hold up pretty well with low- to mid-single digit declines. Every other sector is expected to see a decline of well over 20%.
"
1541,AIG,"As things stand now, the expectations for the second quarter show a little bit of improvement, with year-over-year declines of ""just"" 13.9%. While the expectations for the third and fourth quarters are not shown (and the sample of direct estimates for those quarters is very thin in any case), we can infer a very dramatic rebound in median EPS growth in the second half. Full year median EPS growth rate is expected to be a positive 6.7%, a forecast. I find to be extremely optimistic.

"
1550,AIG,"Only Health Care has made into neutral territory. The overall pace of estimate revisions is slowing dramatically, as it usually does after earnings season is over. The revisions ratio is based on the 4-week moving totals of estimate changes. Thus the rise in the ratio may have more to do with old estimate cuts falling off faster than old estimate increases than it does with new estimate revisions.
"
1551,AIG,"The revisions picture, while still quite negative, has improved significantly in recent weeks for the Technology sector, and remains strong for Health Care (although fading somewhat). Telecom is the strongest, but that is based on a small sample size of estimate revisions. On the downside, the Industrials sector is looking particularly weak with over 15 cuts for every increase. That is far worse than even the perpetual estimate revision cellar dweller, the Financials, where cuts outnumber increases by less than 6:1.
"
1552,AIG,"Keep in mind, that after an earnings season is over, the total number of revisions always falls. When the total number of revisions is falling,, changes in the revisions ratios are affected more by old estimate changes falling out of the totals as by new estimate changes being made.

1560,AIG,"The 2010 revisions ratio story is pretty much the same as 2009. A gradual pattern of a low but improving revisions ratio was slightly reversed this week. In a bit of a surprise, the total number of revisions actually grew this week, counter the normal seasonal pattern. The very small Telecom sector (23 total revisions) and Health Care the best on a relative basis, but nothing to really write home about. As with 2009, the Industrials sector was far and away the weakest, with Financials, Energy and Materials also very weak. However, in recent days the price of oil has started to rebound. If that holds, it seems likely that the estimates could start to head up again for the energy sector. As it stands now, the size of the cuts in the sector is very large.

"
1607,AIG,"Total Net Income Growth
"
1608,AIG,"As total earnings estimate activity wanes due to the end of the earnings season, and old estimates drop off our 4-week moving totals, the revisions ratios have started to rebound, and with them the number of huge mean estimate declines. However, make no mistake, the direction of estimates is still down, just at a some what slower pace.
"
1609,AIG,"The fourth quarter earnings season, is completely finished, and good riddance. It was an unmitigated disaster, especially on a total net income basis. Things are not, however likely to improve that much in the first quarter. Sure it is unlikely that AIG (AIG  -  Free Report) will drop another $61 billion, or even the $35 billion it lost adjusted for one time items (the $35 billion is what we use in our calculations), but still a total net income decline of 35.3% from a year ago is still very ugly.
"
1610,AIG,"However, the Financials were not alone in seeing huge drops in net income. Only 2 sectors, the defensive Health Care and Staples, managed to post higher total net income than a year ago, and neither by double digits. Utilities took the bronze for the quarter due to just a fractional decline in total income. Both the Financial and Consumer Discretionary sectors lost money as a whole in the fourth quarter, and the Material saw its total earnings drop by over 80%
"
1611,AIG,"Looking ahead to the first quarter, every sector is expected to see a decline in total net income relative to the first quarter of 2008. For 8 of the sectors, the year-over-year declines are expected to be worse than the fourth quarter. All told, a 35.3% year over year decline is currently expected.
"
1612,AIG,"The only exceptions are the Financial and Materials sectors. While the Financials may break back into the black this quarter, and a year ago was not exactly a boom time for the sector, I suspect that they will do much worse than the 21.8% decline forecast. As for the Materials, its hard to get to excited about a 72% decline in earnings, even if that is not as bad as an 80% decline.
"
1613,AIG,"Even the early read on the second quarter is downbeat, with a 29.2% year over year decline expected. Consumer Staples are expected to post a slight gain in total net income, and the Health Care and Utilities sectors are expected to have only minor declines. Easy year ago comps will help keep the decline in the Consumer Discretionary sector to ""just 19.2%"". All other sectors are expected to see drops of more than 25%.

"
1616,AIG,"Every sector but Health Care expected to be down
"

"
1618,AIG,"Implied second half rebound, full year 2009 expected to be up 6.7%
"
1619,AIG,"Median EPS growth held up better than total net income. The effect of mindboggling losses like AIG and Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) simply do not affect a median the same way they affect the total net income figures. Still, an 8.3% decline is not very good, yet it looks like that will be better than the first quarter where the expected decline is 19.0%.
"
1620,AIG,"Health Care is the only sector that is expected to see more of its firms grow than shrink their earnings in the quarter. The relatively defensive Staples, Utilities and Telecom sectors are expected to hold the median declines to the mid single digits, but every other sector is looking at a drop of over 20%.
"
1621,AIG,"Still more firms reported EPS that were higher than analysts estimates than disappointed, by a ratio of 1.77:1. That is well below the ""normal"" rate of over 3:1, but it is better than having more disappointments than positive surprises. Long ago companies figured out that it is better to under promise and over deliver, so they keep their guidance conservative, and the analysts thus lowball their estimates.
"
1622,AIG,"Health Care had the most impressive ratio of positive surprises at 10:1, and a very solid median surprise of 3.76%. Since for the most part, firms in that sector are smooth steady earners, the analysts estimates tend to be more tightly grouped together than in more cyclical sectors like Materials or Consumer Discretionary. Thus, even though the median surprise is lower for Health Care than it is for the other two, it is probably more significant.
"
1623,AIG,"Only 3 other sectors managed to get over the 2:1 ratio of positive to negative surprises.

"
1632,AIG,"Only health Care has made into neutral territory. The overall pace of estimate revisions is slowing dramatically, as it usually does after earnings season is over. The revisions ratio is based on the 4-week moving totals of estimate changes. Thus the rise in the ratio may have more to do with old estimate cuts falling off faster than old estimate increases than it does with new estimate revisions.

1653,AIG,"Highlighted stocks include Citigroup, Inc. (C  -  Free Report), Goldman Sachs Group (GS  -  Free Report), WestAmerica Bancorp , General Electric  (GE  -  Free Report) and American International Group (AIG  -  Free Report).
"
1654,AIG,"After yesterday's rally in the financial stocks, you might be wondering if it's finally time to buy. The short answer is ""not yet"". The long answer is more complicated.
"
1655,AIG,"News of an internal memo from Citigroup's (C  -  Free Report) CEO, Vikram Pandit, sparked the rally. Pandit proclaimed that the company was both ""profitable"" so far this year and that it was ""the strongest capitalized large U.S. bank"".
"
1656,AIG,"Adding fuel to the fire was the proposal by Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke to overhaul banking regulations. Traders were also hopeful that a change to mark-to-market rules would be made and the uptick rule would be reinstated.
"
1657,AIG,"Financials Are Full of False Hope
"
1658,AIG,"Though this sounds like good news, the truth is that we've been there, done that.
"
1659,AIG,"Pandit's comments might sound optimistic, but they are really just a broken record.
"
1660,AIG,"CEO Alan Schwartz said Bear Stearns would not have any more write-downs 2 months before his firm failed. Lehman Brothers' CEO, Dick Fuld, was defiant until the end. John Thain pounded the desk on Merrill Lynch before being forced into a shotgun merger.
"
1661,AIG,"Even the markets are skeptical about Citigroup. Yesterday's 40% jump didn't even push the stock above $1.50, or about the price for a bottle of water. And even with this morning's additional gain, it still costs more to ride the train from my office in downtown Chicago to Wrigley Field than it does to buy a share of C.
"
1662,AIG,"Still Waiting On Federal Salvation
"
1663,AIG,"The Fed and the Treasury Department continue to evolve their policies. Unfilled key positions at the Treasury Department are certainly not helping, but Bernanke continues to shift his strategy as well.
"
1664,AIG,"The reluctance to delve fully into nationalization remains a sticking point, even though U.S. taxpayers are taking a huge risk on C, American International Group (AIG  -  Free Report) and many other firms.
"
1665,AIG,"Mark-to-market accounting is another sticking point, particularly in terms of how to change it. A House Financial Services Subcommittee will discuss the matter on Thursday.
"
1666,AIG,"Then there is the uptick rule, which bars traders from short-selling a stock unless the most recent trade is higher than the previous. Some blame the removal of this rule for causing stocks to plunge. As if that rule was responsible for the gross mismanagement of financial firms, the imprudent lending strategies or the willingness of some people to buy homes they couldn't possibly afford.
"
1667,AIG,"Capitalism works by punishing those who make mistakes. If a CEO does not want his stock shorted, there is a simple solution - do a better job of running your company.
"
1668,AIG,"What's On Those Balance Sheets?
"
1669,AIG,"The biggest issue, however, continues to be that banks don't know what is on their balance sheets. A year after the financial firms supposedly threw in everything but the kitchen sink (anybody remember some of the statements made in response to 2007 fourth-quarter earnings?), they still don't know how many kitchen sinks they own.
"
1670,AIG,"Credit cards are only adding to the problems. Though not as big a problem as mortgages, the recession will cause credit card default rates to rise. New fees and higher interest rates are only compounding matters.
"
1671,AIG,"This is why Financials has one of the worst ranks of any sector. Earnings estimates continue to be cut across the board as brokerage analysts realize over and over again that they have underestimated just how badly banks and other financial firms are struggling. (During the past 4 weeks, 6 full-year profit projections have been cut for every forecast that has been raised.)
"
1672,AIG,"Technical Analysis Doesn't Work Either
"
1673,AIG,"Perhaps the biggest short-term risk to the financial stocks, however, is that they have become very difficult to trade. Fundamental analysis doesn't work because their balance sheets are a mess and earnings estimates keep getting slashed.
"
1674,AIG,"Technical analysis is not helpful either. Financial stocks, particularly banking stocks, are trading off of speculation about how close they are to failing and/or being nationalized. For some stocks, the current share price reflects nothing more than an option call on the company's survival as a stand-alone entity. (This was getting to be the case with General Electric  (GE  -  Free Report) because of problems with its financial arm.)
"
1675,AIG,"Even day trading does not work well, given the potential for sharp, intraday reversals.
"
1676,AIG,"Suggestions for Investors
"
1677,AIG,"If the only thing you did since 2007 was pay attention to the Zacks Rank, you would have avoided the wreckage in the financial sector. In fact, you went a step further and shorted the sector (or individual stocks directly), you would have profited handsomely.
"
1678,AIG,"As someone who has been very bearish towards financial stocks, I acknowledge there is a point when attitudes need to change. Though the downside risk for a stock at any point in time is 100% (a stock can always fall to $0), it's difficult to say how much downside is truly left in the financial sector. Those that have been short should consider how much additional profit they think they can really make.
"
1679,AIG,"On the other hand, I'm not convinced it is time to buy financial stocks either. Sentiment and shifting policy decisions make it impossible to determine how these stocks will trade from day to day.
"
1680,AIG,"Last week, our equity research analysts recommended that investors consider waiting for signs of stabilization in the credit and stock markets. At that point, use dollar cost averaging to build positions in potential winners such as Goldman Sachs Group (GS  -  Free Report) and WestAmerica Bancorp .
"
1681,AIG,"Doing so might result in the loss of some upside, but given that downside risks still remain, this strategy could help you sleep at night.

"
1692,AIG,"Earnings Expectations continue to plunge for both 2009 and 2010.
"
1693,AIG,"Over the last week, the 2009 bottom up estimate has fallen a stunning 4.5%, and are down 8.0% over the last month. The decline for 2010 has been just as bad, with a 4.7% decline in the last week and a 7.6% decline over the last month.
"
1694,AIG,"Just because the market is going down like a rock, doesn't mean that valuations are improving significantly. The trend in estimate data is always more important than the level, and you will get a better final estimate of where things will really end up if you extrapolate the trend out rather than basing your decisions on the current level.
"
1695,AIG,"I think that we will probably end up with earnings in the $50 area for 2009 and perhaps $60 for 2010, but I must say that there is more risk to the downside of those figures than to the upside. Keep in mind that these figures exclude one time items, and the vast majority of extraordinary items are going to be negative.
"
1696,AIG,"The fourth-quarter earnings season, is almost completely finished, and good riddance. It was an unmitigated disaster, especially on a total net income basis. The numbers showed a very significant deterioration from last week due to the latest news from the great black hole known as American International Group (AIG  -  Free Report). Taken as a whole, and excluding extraordinary one time charges, the Financial sector lost a total of $57.7 billion in the fourth quarter. The same stocks earned $6.8 billion a year ago. In the third quarter of 2007, the last quarter before the wheels started to fall off the world financial system, they earned almost $43 billion.
"
1697,AIG,"However, Financials were not alone in seeing huge drops in net income. Only 2 sectors, the defensive Health Care and Staples sectors, managed to post higher total net income than a year ago, and neither by double digits. Utilities took the bronze for the quarter due to just a fractional decline in total income. The cyclical Consumer Discretionary and Materials sectors were disasters by just about any measure, with declines of 92.8% and 80.2%, respectively.
"
1698,AIG,"Looking ahead to the first quarter, every sector is expected to see a decline in total net income relative to the first quarter of 2008. For eight of the sectors, the year-over-year declines are expected to be worse than the fourth quarter. All told, a 34.5% year-over-year decline is currently expected.
"
1699,AIG,"The only exceptions are the Financial and Materials sectors. While the Financials may break back into the black this quarter, and a year ago was not exactly a boom time for the sector, I suspect that they will do much worse than the 13.9% decline forecast. As for the Materials, its hard to get to excited about a 70% decline in earnings, even if that is not as bad as an 80% decline.

"
1701,AIG,"Those firms expected to see a 19.0% decline in first quarter
"
1702,AIG,"Yet-to-report firms expected to be down 11.9% in fourth quarter, 8.3% first quarter
"
1703,AIG,"Surprise ratio 1.77, median surprise 2.58% - both below normal
"
1704,AIG,"Health Care still healthy with 13.3% growth, others flat or down
"
1705,AIG,"Health Care, Staples Industrials doing well on Surprise front
"
1706,AIG,"All sectors except Health Care expected to be negative in first quarter
"
1707,AIG,"Median EPS growth held up better than total net income. The effect of mind boggling losses like AIG and Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) simply do not affect a median the same way they affect the total net income figures. Still, an 8.3% decline is not very good, yet it looks like that will be better than the first quarter where the expected decline is 19.0%.
"
1708,AIG,"Health Care is the only sector that is expected to see more of its firms grow than shrink their earnings in the quarter. The relatively defensive Staples, Utilities and Telecom sectors are expected to hold the median declines to the mid single digits, but every other sector is looking at a drop of over 20%.
"
1709,AIG,"Still more firms reported EPS that were higher than analysts estimates than disappointed, by a ratio of 1.77:1. That is well below the ""normal"" rate of over 3:1, but it is better than having more disappointments than positive surprises. Long ago companies figured out that it is better to under promise and over deliver, so they keep their guidance conservative, and the analysts thus lowball their estimates.
"
1710,AIG,"Health Care had the most impressive ratio of positive surprises at 10:1, and a very solid median surprise of 3.76%. Since for the most part, firms in that sector are smooth steady earners, the analysts estimates tend to be more tightly grouped together than in more cyclical sectors like Materials or Consumer Discretionary. Thus, even though the median surprise is lower for health care than it is for the other 2, it is probably more significant. Only 3 other sectors managed to get over the 2:1 ratio of positive to negative surprises.

"
1720,AIG,"The overall pace of estimate revisions is slowing dramatically, as it usually does after earnings season is over. The revisions ratio is based on the four week moving totals of estimate changes.

1770,AIG,"There is a lot of hope being priced into the markets.
"
1771,AIG,"I don't know of any of other reason to explain why the stock markets rallied during Thanksgiving week and held onto much of their gains this week.
"
1772,AIG,"Let's look at the facts.
"
1773,AIG,"The recession is getting worse. The ISM manufacturing index set a new 26-year low. Black Friday sales were not enough to prevent November retail sales from being horribly down. 553,000 jobs were lost last month - the biggest drop since December 1974.
"
1774,AIG,"Valuations are not as cheap as they could be. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DJI) still trades a double-digit P/E. There have previous periods where the average has traded at single-digit P/Es.
"
1775,AIG,"On a technical basis, the Dow has been setting lower highs and lower lows - a bearish trend. My colleague, Kevin Matras, described the chart pattern as a ""sloppy descending triangle""; in other words, a formation that suggests the average could fall lower.
"
1776,AIG,"Hope
"
1777,AIG,"Yet despite nearly every reason to go lower, the major indexes have been holding up fairly well, all things considered.
"
1778,AIG,"The only plausible reason is that traders are hoping that the economy will recover will sooner than later.
"
1779,AIG,"The bullish argument is centered on a few key points.
"
1780,AIG,"The government is not letting most big companies fail. American International Group (AIG  -  Free Report) was thrown a lifeline; albeit at a big cost. Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) was given a safety net. The automakers are getting a second chance to explain why they deserve a bailout.
"
1781,AIG,"The central banks are cutting interest rates. The ECB and the Bank of England slashed rates yesterday. The Fed could take U.S. rates below 1.0%.
"
1782,AIG,"New stimulus is forthcoming. President-elect Obama wants to sign a massive economic package into law as soon as he takes office. The proposal being discussed includes new infrastructure spending as well as tax cuts.
"
1783,AIG,"The perception at that housing market is near a bottom. Mortgage rates recently dropped and there were rumors about the U.S. government proposing a program that would allow for 30-year mortgages at 4.5%.
"
1784,AIG,"I do believe that the combination of central bank intervention and a big stimulus package will help, if both are used effectively. The big question is timing. If one buys into the argument that the markets look 4-6 months ahead, then late November rebound suggests a recovery could occur in late spring.
"
1785,AIG,"I think such sentiment is very optimistic. This said, nobody knows what the second-half of 2009 is going to look like. Therefore, investors would be prudent to follow a more conservative strategy as opposed to taking unnecessary risks.
"

1787,AIG,"In keeping with the theme of following a more conservative strategy, J.M. Smuckers (SJM  -  Free Report) was added to the Focus List this week. The company owns or licenses a wide variety of well-known brands, including Smucker's, Folgers, Crisco, Hungry Jack and Pillsbury. The fundamentals look sound and the stock was trading at a historically low valuation.
"
1788,AIG,"I had hoped to add a second stock this week, but nothing that I looked at really excited me or the portfolio committee. One of the worst mistakes an investor can make is to buy a stock simply because he feels like he has to. It's better to sit on the sidelines a little longer than to force a trade.

"
1790,AIG,"As I said before, the Dow is setting lower highs and lower lows. Though this is a bearish pattern, the one caveat to any chart pattern is that it only holds until it doesn't. In other words, sooner or later, a new pattern will emerge.

1794,AIG,"The market opened up rallying on news of a $586 billion Chinese stimulus package but quickly turned lower on concerns over the U.S. economy, especially in light of the government giving American International Group (AIG  -  Free Report) more money as part of a rescue package and shares of General Motors Corp. (GM) plunging to some of the lowest levels seen in more than 60 years.    
"
1795,AIG,"Investors interpreted the news of China's stimulus package as a reassuring sign on a global level. However, most market participants do not see the Chinese stimulus having a significant impact on domestic economic woes.  
"
1796,AIG,"Stocks closed off their lows but remained mostly in the red with all three major averages turning in losses for the day. The Dow Jones industrial average closed 73.27 points, or 0.82%, lower at 8,870.54. The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 11.78 points, or 1.27%, closing at 919.21. The Nasdaq dipped by 30.66 points, or 1.86%, to 1,616.74.
"
1797,AIG,"After receiving an initial bailout package from the government in September, AIG received more assistance from the government today, bringing the total aid package to $150 billion. Shares of AIG advanced about 8% on the news. However, most financials tumbled as this development translated into more anxiety on Wall Street.    
"

"
1808,AIG,"American International Group Inc. (AIG  -  Free Report) has agreed to buy Bermuda based reinsurer, Validus Holdings Ltd. (Validus) for $5.56 billion in cash.The deal should see light by mid-2018.Why a Good FitValidus is a good pick for AIG given its market leadership in property catastrophe reinsurance, synergies from its AlphaCat alternative capital platform, good liquidity and capital adequacy, and long-term profitability.These positives are however, to some extent offset by Validus' property catastrophe reinsurance exposures, which subjects it to earnings volatility and the highly competitive operating environment in the reinsurance market.The deal would be immediately accretive to AIG’s earnings per share and return on equity (ROE).Rating ActionsFollowing the announcement of the acquisition, Moody's and A.M. Best jumped into action.Moody’s affirmed the Baa1 senior unsecured debt rating of AIG and the A2 insurance financial strength ratings of AIG’s US property & casualty insurance operations. The rating outlook for AIG and its units remain stable.The rating agency notes the focus of the new CEO, Brian Duperreault, appointed last year in May, for preferential use of capital for building the organization via inorganic growth measures, rather than making share repurchases.Despite the positives that the deal may bring, Moody’s regards the deal as a credit negative for  AIG as it may magnify the company’s gross catastrophe exposure, deteriorate the company’s liquidity  profile (due to the all cash financing of the deal) and pose execution risk related to the acquisition.The other rating agency A.M.Best, however, gave a more favorable view of the deal, stating that it will not cause material execution risk, given no business overlapping and modest size of Validus. The rating agency also acknowledged that the deal will improve performance of its property-casualty business.It also kept the credit ratings (ratings) of AIG and its subsidiaries unchanged.What’s in Store for AIGThe deal will provide additional heft to the company’s General Insurance business by providing it with a reinsurance platform.  It will also allow AIG to take control of third-party capital and investment management business via Validus’ unit AlphaCat Managers.Share Price PerformanceShares of the company have lost 6% in a year’s time, underperforming the  14.5% growth of the industry it belongs to. Declining top line, weak Commercial Lines business, unfavorable reserve development and catastrophe losses have cumulatively taken a toll on the company’s share price.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderAIG carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A few better-ranked stocks are Horace Mann Educators Corporation (HMN  -  Free Report), Kemper Corp. (KMPR  -  Free Report) and MTG Investment Corp. (MTG  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Horace Mann Educators beat estimates in two of the four reported quarters with an average positive surprise of 29.5%.Kemper Corp. beat estimates in each of the four reported quarters with an average positive surprise of 105.6%.MGIC Investment surpassed estimates in each of the four reported quarters with an average positive surprise of 35.1%.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

"
1809,AIG,"It’s hard to consider the worthiness of a stock without sizing up the company’s profitability potential. Calling earnings as the mother’s milk of stocks is probably not an exaggeration. The bottom line is that earnings are very important to keep an eye on for anyone interested in stocks.Everyone has an intuition for ‘earnings’ and see it as the leftover of sales after all the business expenses have been accounted for. This otherwise simple and intuitive principle gets complicated as a result of accounting rules that vary from country to country. In the U.S., the accounting rules mandating what can be called earnings (officially it’s called ‘net income’) in the company’s audited financial statements available to shareholders are called GAAP rules (GAAP stands for generally accepted accounting principles).I am oversimplifying here, but GAAP rules don’t differentiate between business expenses that are incurred regularly and those that take place every now and then. The investing community likes to make that distinction; they see regular and recurring expenses as the only ones that should matter to those interested in evaluating the stock; the non-recurring ones need not be taken into account. As such, the investing community makes adjustments to reported GAAP earnings, by taking out non-recurring expenses and gains. All the earnings discussion you see in the marketplace is primarily about such ‘adjusted’ earnings.And as you can imagine, such ‘adjusted’ earnings are (almost) always higher than the official GAAP earnings, but the ‘gap’ (no pun intended) between the two is typically not that big. That’s not the case in the ongoing Q4 earnings season, which ramps up in a big way this week with more than 250 companies reporting results, including 81 S&P 500 members.For the 53 S&P 500 members that have reported Q4 results already, as of Friday, January 19th, the magnitude of gap between adjusted earnings and GAAP earnings is unlike anything we have seen over the last few years. On average, adjusted earnings were +6% higher than GAAP earnings over the preceding 16 quarters for these 53 S&P 500.But as you can see in the chart below, the gap is extremely wide for 2017Q4 and likely to remain in record territory even as the reporting cycle moves beyond the Finance sector where the issue was very pronounced.A lot goes into ‘earnings quality’. But as a general rule, it is reasonable to be wary of a big variance between adjusted and GAAP earnings. Going by this simple rule, you have to question the ‘quality’ of Q4 earnings reports, irrespective of the growth pace and proportion of positive surprises on the ‘adjusted’ earnings front.A few specific examples should help make this point. Citigroup (C) earned $3.38 billion on an adjusted basis, but lost $18.8 billion on GAAP basis. American Express (AXP) earned $1.39 billion on an adjusted basis, but lost roughly $1.2 billion on GAAP basis. IBM (IBM  -  Free Report) earned $4.8 billion on an adjusted basis, but lost $1.1 billion on GAAP basis. The list goes on and on.As pointed out at the top, it makes analytical sense to exclude these one-time charges from the data so that investors have a clear sense of underlying business trends and not get distracted by one-off gains or losses. Such charges were commonplace during the global financial crisis of 2008.I will mention detail from that period – AIG (AIG) lost $52.1 billion for full-year 2008 on an adjusted basis and lost $103 billion that year on GAAP basis. It’s hard to envision any company improving upon that type of ‘performance’ in this earnings season.The rest of the earnings discussion in this note will be using ‘adjusted’ earnings. But before I give you the Q4 earnings season scorecard on an adjusted earnings basis, let me give you the GAAP scorecard first.On A GAAP basis, total earnings for the 53 S&P 500 members that have reported results already are down -57.8% from the same period last year on +7.5% higher revenues.Q4 Earnings Season Scorecard (as of Friday, January 19, 2018)Total earnings for the 53 S&P 500 members that have reported results already are up +11.7% from the same period last year on +7.5% higher revenues, with 81.1% beating EPS estimates and 75.5% beating revenue estimates. The proportion of companies beating both EPS and revenue estimates is 62.3%.To put these results in a historical context, the charts below compare the results thus far with what we had seen from the same group of 53 index members in other recent periods.Any way you look at these results, the Q4 earnings season is on track to be very good, notwithstanding the ‘quality’ issue highlighted earlier. Here are the four points that stand out from the results thus far.•    First, the +11.7% earnings growth for the 53 index members compares is about the same as the +11.9% growth in Q3 and modestly below the 4-quarter average of +12.8%.•    Second, the +7.5% revenue growth for these 53 index members represents a notable acceleration in growth momentum.•    Third, the 81.1% proportion of the companies beating EPS estimates in Q4 is the highest we have seen from these 53 index members in other recent periods. •    Fourth, the 75.5% of the companies beating revenue is similarly the highest we have seen from this group of companies in recent periods.The Revenue MomentumThe comparison charts below highlight the emerging revenue momentum that’s coming out of the Q4 earnings seasonWe started this note by discussing the variance between adjusted and GAAP earnings this reporting season, but it is worth pointing out that there is no such issue on the revenues front. As such, this revenue momentum is a particularly positive aspect of this earnings season and the overall corporate earnings backdrop.Standout SectorsIt is still relatively early, with no results yet from three of the 16 Zacks sectors. The most results at this stage have come from the Finance sector, with results from 47.5% of the sector’s market cap in the S&P 500 index.Total earnings from these Finance sector companies that have reported already are up +4.8% from the same period last year on +3.8% higher revenues, with 85.7% beating EPS estimates and 61.9% beating revenue estimates.The comparison chars below that growth (earnings & revenue) is tracking below other recent periods, but results have otherwise been better than expected. In other words, the proportion of companies beating estimates is above historical periods.Key Earnings Reports for the Week of January 22ndMonday (1/22): We have 28 companies coming out with results this day, of which 4 are S&P 500 members. Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) is the most notable report this day, coming after the market’s close. More than EPS and revenue results, the key metric in focus will be the company’s subscriber growth. The Zacks Consensus expectation is for domestic streaming subscriber base to reach 52.2 million, up from the preceding quarter’s 51.345 million ending balance. The company’s domestic streaming subscription base was 47.9 million at the end of December 2016. The key growth area for the company lately has been the international markets. On the international front, the expectation is for the streaming subscriber base to reach 57.18 million in Q4, up from Q3’s 52.678 million and the year-earlier 41.185 million.Tuesday (1/23): We have 49 companies reporting results on Tuesday, including 15 S&P 500 members. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report), Proctor & Gamble (PG  -  Free Report) and Verizon (VZ  -  Free Report) are the notable reports in the morning session while United-Continental (UAL  -  Free Report) and Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report) are the major reports after the close.Wednesday (1/24): We have 63 companies reporting results on Tuesday, including 27 S&P 500 members. Comcast (CMCSA) and GE (GE  -  Free Report) are the notable of the 16 index members reporting in the morning while Ford (F) is the key report after the market’s close.Thursday (1/25): More than 100 companies are reporting results on Thursday, including 28 S&P 500 members. Caterpillar (CAT) and 3M (MMM  -  Free Report) are the most notable of the 18 S&P 500 members reporting results in the morning while Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) and Starbucks (SBUX  -  Free Report) are reporting after the close.Friday (1/26): Honeywell (HON  -  Free Report) is among the 6 index members reporting results Friday morning.Expectations for Q4 As a WholeTotal Q4 earnings are expected to be up +10.3% from the same period last year on +7.1% higher revenues. This would follow +6.7% earnings growth in 2017 Q3 on +5.9% growth in revenues.The table below shows the summary picture for Q4, contrasted with what was actually achieved in Q3.The chart below shows Q4 earnings growth expectations contrasted with what is expected in the following three quarters and actual results in the preceding 5 quarters. As you can see in the chart below, the growth pace is expected to pick up in Q4 after dipping in the preceding quarter and continue accelerating going forward.Tax Cuts Pushing Estimates HigherI want to touch on the favorable revisions trend for the current and coming quarters at present. Regular readers will recall that estimates for the Q4 earnings season had held up unusually better in the run up to the start of this earnings season. But what we are witnessing with estimates for the current and following quarters is extremely positive.The typical pattern over the last few years has been that estimates for the quarter will start coming down as we will get closer to the reporting season for that quarter. The opposite is the case with the current (and following) quarter(s), with estimates starting to go up in a notable way. You can clearly see this in the evolving earnings growth expectations for 2018 Q1, as depicted in the chart below.Note: Sheraz Mian manages the Zacks equity research department.

1810,AIG,"RenaissanceRe Holdings Ltd. (RNR  -  Free Report) expects to incur catastrophe (cat) loss of $90 million, from the California wildfires.In the fourth quarter, these losses will further weigh on the company’s bottom line.RenaissanceRe incurred a loss of $9.63 per share for the first nine months of 2017 compared to earnings of $5.14 in prior-year period.Unprecedented catastrophe led to net claims and claims expenses of $1.6 billion in the first nine months of 2017, significantly higher than $0.4 billion in the year ago period.AIR Worldwide, a catastrophe modeling firm expects insured losses from wildfires to exceed $10 billion.This specialty insurer has witnessed multiple weather-related losses in 2017. The results in the third quarter were severely hurt by hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, the Mexico City Earthquake. These natural calamities are estimated to have caused damages of more than $100 billion and underwriting losses at many insurers and reinsurers.So far this year, the stock has declined by 5.9%, underperforming the industry’s growth of 17%.   Losses Estimates Provided by Other PlayersThe Allstate Corporation (ALL  -  Free Report) has estimated pre-tax catastrophe loss of $516 million for October 2017 due to California wildfires.Another insurance giant, American International Group (AIG  -  Free Report) has projected $500 million loss from the same event.Travelers Cos. Inc. (TRV  -  Free Report) estimates pre-tax loss in the range of $525 million to $675 million and after-tax loss in the $340 million to $440 million band.Bottom LineOn the face of it, catastrophe losses resulted in an increase in loss ratio, thereby hurting insurers’ underwriting margins. However, these losses act as catalysts in turning the industry's pricing cycle. The industry which has amassed a huge capital buffer and led to soft pricing (thanks to a benign cat loss environment in recent years) will likely see price surge in certain lines of business that have been mostly affected.RenaissanceRe carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1811,AIG,"Investors in American International Group, Inc. (AIG  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Dec 15, 2017 $60.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for American International Group shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, American International Group is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) in the Insurance - Multi line industry that ranks in the Bottom 24% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30 days, one analyst has increased the earnings estimates for the current quarter, while five have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $1.21 per share to $1.00 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about American International Group right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options? Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

1812,AIG,"Multi-line insurer American International Group Inc. (AIG  -  Free Report) has lately been witnessing downward revisions. The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings per share being revised a whopping 44.6% downward to $2.76 over the last 60 days. Also for 2018, the consensus mark has moved 7.4% south to $4.98 over the same time frame.The stock carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) and has an unimpressive Value Score of D. Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) offer the best upside potential. Hence, the stock under discussion does not look promising at present.Further, shares of AIG have underperformed the industry so far this year. The stock has lost 9.3% versus the industry’s 8.7% gain.What’s Bothering AIG?The company’s Commercial insurance segment has been underperforming for several quarters. In 2016, the segment reported a pre-tax operating loss of $2.74 billion while the same registered $1.3 billion in the first nine months of 2017. The segment is reeling under a rise in core losses and adverse development to account for current loss trends.Given that the company has exited some of the casualty lines business, we expect the top line to remain under pressure. The company also had a two-year plan (formed in January 2016) to improve the segment’s profitability but with significant loss incurred of late, it is unlikely to achieve the goal.Also unfavorable reserve development from past several years continues to impede underwriting results at AIG. The sluggishness further adds to the uncertainty and questions the company’s underwriting discipline and claims paying ability. Also, the company’s nature of operations exposes it to weather-related losses. Catastrophes have historically imparted volatility to the company’s earnings and will be a headwind going forward.The company’s newly-appointed CEO has made a significant shift in its capital utilization strategy in a bid to turn the stock around and achieve greater profitability. Management now expects to utilize capital for possible acquisitions in international markets, boosting the company’s personal and life lines segments plus investing in the domestic middle market as opposed to its hitherto usage of capital resource for share repurchases.Though on one hand, the company’s forthcoming buyouts will expand its business but those might not be accretive to earnings immediately. On the other, the bottom line will be bereft of the support provided by effective buybacks till now. This might likely decrease earnings in the coming quarters.Further, AIG’s trailing 12-month return on equity (ROE) undermines its growth potential. The company’s 6.1% ROE compares unfavorably with the ROE of 7.7% for the industry, reflecting that it is inefficient in using shareholder funds.Picking Favorable Insurance StocksWhile AIG doesn’t appear to be an attractive pick right now, there are a few other insurance stocks that have a better Zacks Rank and a potent Value Score to emerge as best bets. Also, these companies have outperformed the industry’s rally so far this year.With the help of the Zacks Stock Screener, we have zeroed in on some solid insurance stocks with a Value Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank of 1 or 2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Kingstone Companies, Inc (KINS  -  Free Report) carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has a Value Score of B. The company’s current-quarter earnings are expected to grow 11.5% year over year. Further, shares of the company have jumped 39.3% year to date.Radian Group Inc. (RDN  -  Free Report) is a Zacks #2 Ranked player and has a Value Score of B. The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-quarter earnings being pegged at 8.5% year-over-year growth. Further, shares of the company have rallied 16.2% year to date.Third Point Reinsurance Ltd. (TPRE  -  Free Report) has a Zacks Rank of 2 and a Value Score of B. The company’s current-quarter earnings are anticipated to skyrocket 265.2% year over year. Further, shares of the company have surged 45% year to date.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

1813,AIG,"Today, investors often place their faith in stocks that they think are poised to grow exponentially in both the near and long-term. This often leaves growth-minded investors fixated on stocks such as Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), which continue on their meteoric climbs.Yet, at a time when many investors target superior growth—often in favor of many other metrics—value investing can still be a solid way to invest.A company that currently presents great value for investors is Prudential Financial (PRU  -  Free Report).Let’s take a look at Prudential’s most recent quarterly results and more of the financial firm’s current fundamentals to help investors gauge whether they want to consider Prudential stock at this time.Fundamentals Prudential posted its third-quarter results last week. The firm reported earnings of $3.01 per share, which beat Wall Street expectations and also marked a 13.2% year-over-year gain. Prudential’s revenues jumped over 10% to hit $13.4 billion (also read: Prudential Financial (PRU  -  Free Report) Q3 Earnings and Revenues Beat).Prudential is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and sports an “A” grade for Value in our Style Scores system.One of the first major value indicators many investors often point to is a company’s price to earnings ratio. Prudential is currently trading at 10.92x earnings, which marks big discount compared to the “Insurance - Multi line” industry’s average.On top of its solid PE ratio, Prudential’s 0.84 price to sales ratio is also strong and comes in well below its industry’s 1.07 average. The firm’s P/S ratio also marks a discount compared to some of its biggest competitors, such as AIG (AIG  -  Free Report). Prudential’s P/B ratio of 0.84 is also a major discount compared to the industry and helps boost the firm’s overall value-based resume.Along with these valuation metrics, Prudential currently presents a decent dividend yield of 2.68%.Prudential Financial, Inc. PS Ratio (TTM) Prudential Financial, Inc. PS Ratio (TTM) | Prudential Financial, Inc. QuoteShares of Prudential have gained almost 30% over the last year, and 5.45% during the last 12-weeks.And just so investors don’t leave thinking that Prudential is only a value investment, the company rocks an “A” grade for Momentum in our Style Scores system to help it earn an overall VGM grade of an “A.”The company’s Q4 earnings are expected to gain 3.56%, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates. Prudential’s EPS is projected to jump nearly 13% for the full-year.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius. Click for details >>

1814,AIG,"American International Group Inc. (AIG  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter 2017 operating loss of $1.22 per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 47%. In the year-ago quarter, the company had reported earnings of $1.01 per share.The underperformance stemmed from a $3.0 billion impact from unprecedented catastrophic events like hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria. This matched the company’s previously disclosed preliminary loss estimates.Also perturbing was a disclosure by the company that it added $836 million to prior accident year loss reserves.The company is getting along well with its expense reduction program (taken up in Jan 2016 to reduce cost base by $1.4 billion by the end of 2017) as evident by a 15.3% decline in general operating and other expenses (GOE) to $2.1 billion.American International Group, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise American International Group, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | American International Group, Inc. QuoteQuarterly Segment HighlightsCommercial Insurance Suffers From Loss ClaimsNet premiums written were down 13% year over year (both on a reported and a constant dollar basis) to $3.8 billion due to strategic portfolio actions and divestitures.Combined ratio of 195.4% deteriorated a massive 8960 basis points year over year, primarily due to an increase in loss ratio, which was due to huge catastrophe losses. This also caused pre-tax operating loss of $2.86 billion in contrast with an operating income of $685 million in the year-ago quarter.Uninspiring Consumer Insurance ResultsPremium and fees of $3.88 billion remained unchanged year over year.Pre-tax operating earnings decreased 18% year over year to $1 billion due to a decline in contribution from Individual Retirement and loss from Personal Insurance sub-segments.The segment’s combined ratio of 105.6% deteriorated 810 points year over year.Financial PositionAt the end of the third quarter, the insurer’s adjusted book value per share (excluding AOCI) was $57.44, down 6.5% year over year.Core adjusted return on equity (ROE) was negative 11.6% compared with 9% in the year-ago quarter.In the third quarter, AIG spent $275 million on share repurchase.Business UpdateIn September, the decision by Financial Stability Oversight Council stripped off the nonbank Systemically Important Financial Institution designation on AIG.On Nov 1, 2017, AIG closed the sale of its remaining life settlements’ portfolio, which will result in the remittance of $1.1 billion of cash proceeds to AIG Parent in fourth-quarter 2017 and fulfill the $9 billion return of Legacy capital.Turn Around Might Take Some More TimeAIG’s results reflect the wrath of Mother Nature. The company has been suffering from tough markets conditions and its massive size, with numerous uncorrelated businesses creating little or no synergy. A number of asset sale and business divestitures made over the last many years have however streamlined the company to some extent.Last quarter, the insurance giant appointed Brian Duperreault as it new CEO, with expectations of improving operations, by completing restructuring initiatives already underway and making further changes.Nevertheless its underperforming commercial lines business, and exposure to catastrophe continue to bother. We believe it will take a while for the efforts to show actual results.Zacks Rank and Other PlayersAIG carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Hold).  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Among the other players in the same space, the bottom line at MetLife Inc. (MET  -  Free Report), Prudential Financial Inc. (PRU  -  Free Report) and Aflac Inc.

1815,AIG,"Third-quarter earnings have already crossed the halfway mark. As of Oct 27, 272 S&P 500 companies reported results with strong earnings numbers. Per the latest Earnings Preview, third-quarter results of these companies account for 64.2% of the index’s total market capitalization.Total earnings for these companies are up 8.7% year over year on 6.7% rise in revenues, with 75.7% beating earnings per share estimates and 66.2% topping revenue estimates.The insurance industry, an integral part of the the Finance sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors), will witness soft results in the third quarter. A soft performance from the insurance industry will be a drag on the Finance sector’s third-quarter results. Per our report, earnings of the Finance sector will decline 2.9% though revenues will increase 1.1%.The third quarter witnessed a slew of catastrophes, which will weigh on underwriting profitability as well as the bottom line of insurers. Though increasing catastrophes will induce fluctuation in underwriting results, we expect prudent underwriting practices and capital reserve piled up on a benign catastrophe environment to withstand the loss to some extent.We do not expect insurance pricings to be strong in the third quarter.However, net investment income, an important component of an insurer’s top line, is likely to witness improvement courtesy of three rate hikes approved since December 2016. Though the rate environment is advancing at snail’s pace, the impact of rate increase is clearly visible in the insurer’s investment results. The third quarter will also not be an exception.Higher rates should offer some respite to life insurers, which suffered spread compression on products like fixed annuities and universal life due to continued low rates. Annuity sales should also benefit from higher rates.However, life insurers have considerably lowered their exposure to interest-sensitive product lines.Let’s take a sneak peek into the expected performance of four multiline insurance stocks that are scheduled to report earnings on Nov 2.American International Group Inc. (AIG  -  Free Report) third-quarter results are likely to suffer from nearly $3 billion of estimated catastrophe loss from hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria and the earthquake in Mexico. A lower amount of share buyback would also hurt its bottom line.We expect to see earnings strength in its Consumer segment as the company enjoys a leading market position across many products and distribution channels, which allow it to maintain profitability in evolving markets.Our proven model shows that AIG does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — positive Earnings ESP  and Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 — to beat earnings estimates. It has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.We caution against the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.

QuoteCigna Corp.’s (CI  -  Free Report) third-quarter results are expected to reflect growth in medical customers and specialty relationships, continued effective medical cost management operating expense discipline and strong capital.We expect to see increased membership on growth across all its Commercial market segments, given its diversified product portfolio, a wide agent network and superior service. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total membership is 15.7 million, up 3.5% year over year.Increased revenues from Global Supplemental Business are likely on the back of its leading innovations, direct-to-consumer distribution capabilities, and easy-to-understand, affordable products that are designed to fill in gaps in coverage and locally licensed and strongly managed talent. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from this unit is $963 million, up 10.9% year over year.Our proven model shows that Cigna does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients to beat earnings estimates. It carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) that significantly increases the chances of an earnings beat. But it has an Earnings ESP of -0.23%, which makes our surprise prediction difficult.

(AIZ  -  Free Report) has likely witnessed a decline in net premiums earned in the soon-to-be-reported quarter, mainly due to the ongoing normalization of lender-placed insurance business plus reduced contributions from mortgage solutions. Also, unprecedented hurricane activity will add to this downside. To that end, Assurant has projected pre-tax reportable catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance and reinstatement premiums, arising from Harvey, to range between $134 million and $140 million. Such losses will impact the performance of Global Housing segment the most in the third quarter.Further, the company anticipates loss from Irma to exceed its retention of $125 million pretax. However, these losses will be covered by the company’s reinsurance program.Our proven model shows that Assurant does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients to beat earnings estimates.

1816,AIG,"American International Group Inc. (AIG  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 2, after market close.Last quarter, this company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings by 27.5%. Also, earnings were up 33% year over year.Better-than-expected earnings were driven by strong performance from the company’s Consumer business partially offset by losses sustained by its Commercial business. Also, cost control efforts and shares bought back during the quarter aided the bottom line.The company has a positive surprise history, having exceeded estimates in two of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 0.1%. This is depicted in the graph below:American International Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise American International Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | American International Group, Inc. QuoteLet’s Take a Look at the Factors Affecting Q3 ResultsWeakness in Commercial Insurance Segment – The company’s Commercial Insurance business has been suffering for the past many quarters from challenging market conditions. Management has undertaken actions to restore profitability in this segment by shifting its mix of business to the more profitable ones. This has led to a reduction in U.S. casualty exposure, shrinking the gross book by a third from 2015. While business portfolio repositioning has reduced operating risk, the segment’s revenues continue to suffer from reduction in premium written from forgone business. The same is expected to be reflected in third-quarter results.The segment’s underwriting profitability is likely to suffer from nearly $3 billion of estimated catastrophe loss from hurricanes — Harvey, Irma, Maria and the earthquake in Mexico.We expect the segment’s profitability to suffer in the third quarter from high loss claims at a time when the segment’s top line is already weighed down by challenging market conditions.Lower Share Buyback – The company’s newly appointed CEO has made a shift in its capital utilization strategy in an effort to scoop up more profits. Management now expects to utilize capital for possible acquisitions in international markets, personal and life lines, and domestic middle market as opposed to significant capital used for share repurchases till now.Though the acquisitions to be made by the company will expand its business, these might not be immediately accretive to earnings. The bottom line will also be bereft of the support provided by significant buybacks till now. This might likely drain earnings in the third quarter.Strong Consumer Segment – This business represents roughly half of the company's core equity and is a valuable source of earning stability. The company enjoys a leading market position across many products and distribution channels, which allow it to maintain profitability in evolving markets. We expect improved contribution from Group Retirement and the Life Insurance line of business.In its Life Insurance sub-segment, the company recently introduced a new administrative platform and digital capabilities, revamped its product suite, and substantially exited its U.S. life career distribution channel, service agent channel, and subscale group benefits business. These steps were undertaken to enhance ROE from this line of business. The efforts were reflected in an increase in life insurance sales in the first half of 2017 and we expect to see further sales growth in the third quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that AIG is likely to beat on earnings this quarter.

1817,AIG,"International Business Machines Corp. (IBM  -  Free Report) recently added features to its on-premise Cloud Object Storage System, making it further lucrative for customers. The newest incorporations include vaults meant for compliance data storage and a dispersal mode that enables easy scalability.Per the norms of certain regulations like SEC 17a-4(f), companies have to store the unadulterated versions of some compliance data for a specific time period. IBM is introducing data storage vaults for these documents where all the requisites are met and the electronic records are in an indestructible format.Simultaneously, the company announced the availability of a service that is configured to let companies get started with the IBM Cloud Object Storage System at a pretty small capacity such as 72 TB that will have lesser hardware requirements. The service will allow less-complicated scalability to larger configurations per the requirement. This will ensure optimized resource usage for both IBM and its client.IBM’s Growth ProspectsIBM shares have lost 10.6% year to date, outperforming the industry’s 15.5% decline. We believe that the company has significant growth prospects in the cloud along with emerging technologies like Blockchain.We note that the cloud segment presents significant potential for IBM. In recent times, its cloud based solutions continue have been adopted by the likes of Syniverse, State of Arizona, Codify Academy, Italian airport operator SEA and Germany-based leading automotive supplier Faurecia.Apart from this, the unveiling of four new data centers and availability of cloud containers at Australian data centers are further tailwinds.IBM was also recently awarded a $135 million contract by the U.S. Army's Logistics Support Activity (LOGSA) for providing cloud-based services. We believe all these will help the company to win a competitive edge against industry peers like Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Microsoft Corporation (MSFT  -  Free Report).International Business Machines Corporation Revenue (TTM) International Business Machines Corporation Revenue (TTM) | International Business Machines Corporation QuoteMoreover, IBM is actively participating in advancement of Blockchain technology. Blockchain, which deals with secured data storage and transmission, is being adopted across multiple industries.IBM’s bank guarantee deals with ANZ and Westpac and a multi-line insurance contract with American International Group (AIG  -  Free Report) and Standard Chartered PLC are some of the recent instances. IBM has also inked a deal with global food suppliersand another one with automobile manufacturer, ZF Friedrichshafen to enhance its Car e-Wallet technology.Additionally, IBM is still a prominent name in the mainframe industry and recently shipped its first z14 mainframe model.

"
1818,AIG,"Stocks started the week off in the red on low volume with financials causing a great deal of the bearish action thanks to concerns over American International Group, Inc. (AIG  -  Free Report), which stemmed from a Credit Suisse analyst cutting his price target on the company. This news hit the street on the heels of Fitch Ratings late-Friday announcement that it might cut its ratings on AIG. The Dow Jones Industrial component was Mondays biggest decliner of the 30 stocks that make up the index, losing 5.49%. Volume was thin mainly because many traders are on vacation during the last week of August.   
"
1819,AIG,"The Dow tumbled 241.81 points, or 2.08%, to 11,386.25, erasing Fridays gain of almost 200 points. The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 25.36 points, or 1.96%, ending the session at 1,266.84. The Nasdaq composite index declined by 49.12 points, or 2.03%, closing at 2,365.59.
"
1820,AIG,"Mondays selloff translated into higher bond prices as investors fled to quality. The 10-year Treasury note yield, which moves opposite its price, slipped to 3.78% from Fridays 3.87%. 
"
1821,AIG,"The dollar was mixed against major currencies, while gold prices fell.  
"
1822,AIG,"Adding to Wall Streets woes today was a real estate report that revealed an all-time high of unsold properties in July. Additionally, the National Association of Realtors' report showed an above-expectations jump in existing home sales of 3.1%. However, this increase was for the most part received with apathy.
"
1823,AIG,"Oil prices saw a great deal of up and down action during todays session as crude settled 52 cents higher at $115.11 per barrel on news of Tropical Storm Gustav forming in the Caribbean.
"
1824,AIG,"Gas prices at the pump are slightly lower as a gallon of regular gasoline dipped nearly a penny overnight. According to the AAA auto club, the national average stands at $3.681.
"
1825,AIG,"The Focus List
"
1826,AIG,"Our Focus List holdings were also down on average but by a narrower margin than the broader market. The portfolio slipped by 1.74% Monday. 
"
1827,AIG,"Two companies that prevented the Focus List from falling further were CF Industries Holdings, Inc. (CF  -  Free Report) and Genco Shipping & Trading Ltd. (GNK  -  Free Report), which gained 1.65% and 3.27% respectively. There were no major developments on either holding.
"
1828,AIG,"We are coming to the end of the second quarter earnings season. Five of the 10 sectors have all their results in and two more have more than 95% in. Most of the remaining firms are Retailers with quarters ending in July rather than June.
"
1829,AIG,"The results for the 461 firms that have reported are mixed; encouraging in median EPS growth terms, but downright awful in terms of total net income growth. Aside from the Financials and Discretionary firms, however, the results are encouraging.
"
1830,AIG,"Positive surprises are leading disappointments by a 2.4:1 ratio, which is only slightly below recent historical norms. The median surprise is also inline with recent history at 3.08%.
"
1831,AIG,"The median year-over-year EPS growth rate of 9.33% is wonderful news for the market. And it looks like it will probably hold up. The median expected EPS growth rate for the firms that are yet to report is 16.6%.
"
1832,AIG,"Energy is finished reporting and currently holds the Gold medal spot with growth of 25.4%. Tech is in Silver, with median EPS growth of 22.1%. This is based on the results of 63 companies, or 88.7% of the total Tech firms in the index. Absent some significant positive surprises it seems unlikely to overtake Energy in the median EPS growth event. Telecom is in the Bronze medal spot with 15.5%, and it should hold on to its place on the podium.
"
1833,AIG,"In the earnings surprise event, two sectors have been particularly impressive. Health Cares median EPS growth rate is 14.3%.  Health Care is showing 6.2 positive surprises for each disappointment, with a median surprise of 4.69%. That however is only good enough for the silver.
"
1834,AIG,"The gold goes to the Industrials, which despite a slightly lower growth rate of 13.8%, have posted a surprise ratio of 6.1:1 and a median surprise of 5.00%.
"
1835,AIG,"Two sectors could try to make a claim on the bronze, Utilities if the judges were swayed by a high Median surprise of 4.88%, and over looked a surprise ratio of just 1.6:1, or Telecom which had a surprise ratio of 6:1 but just a 3.85% median surprise, would be the two leading contenders.
"
1836,AIG,"The Financials have been the weakest sector by far, with the median EPS dropping by 18.2% from a year ago. The sector is responsible for almost one-third of all the earnings disappointments to this point. The Consumer Discretionary sector is the only other one to show negative year-over-year growth on a median EPS basis (-4.0%).  The remaining Consumer Discretionary firms are expected to show a 1.3% decrease, meaning that there should not be a big change from what has already been reported.
"
1837,AIG,"Some of the factors which should help median EPS growth are share repurchases, which though have slowed in recent months, will still reflect what happened last year. Oddly, increased share counts will also help boost EPS among the Financials. Since the ones that have increased their share counts the most (by going hat in had to the sovereign wealth funds looking for new capital) are also the ones that are likely to reports losses, so the loss per share will be less.
"
1838,AIG,"In addition, to the extent that firms have large operations overseas, they should benefit from the currency translation effects of the weak dollar. The weak dollar has also boosted those companies that export a substantial portion of their sales.
"
1839,AIG,"Keep in mind that median growth rates are inherently equally weighted, so the growth rate for Cabot Oil and Gas (COG) is just as significant to the results for the Energy sector as the growth rate for Exxon (XOM  -  Free Report).

"
1841,AIG,"While on a median EPS growth basis, things might look ok, the same is not true on a total net income basis. This has been yet another very ugly quarter.
"
1842,AIG,"The blame for net income decline once again goes to the Financials (with best supporting actor nomination for the Consumer Discretionary). Overall, the second quarter is now expected to be even weaker than the first quarter, and on par with the fourth quarter.
"
1843,AIG,"However, the news is not bleak everywhere. Tech and Energy are locked in a tight battle for gold in the total net income growth event. Energy has all its results in, and posted 17.3% growth. Tech still has a few to go, and is leading right now with growth of 18.0%, but the remaining techs are only expected to post growth of 3.4%, which should drag them out of the Gold medal spot. Health Care looks like it beat out Industrials for the bronze, but with only 8.4% growth to 6.1%, it was not a very inspiring bronze medal performance.
"
1844,AIG,"The Financials have once again been a total disaster on the total net income front. When all is said and done the Financials total earnings are expected to be 83.5% below last year. Keep in mind just how important the Financials are in a ""normal"" year. In last years second quarter, they accounted for 28.5% of all S&P 500 earnings at this point. This year they are only raking in 6.1% of all the earnings.
"
1845,AIG," Of course, since the shares of the pie have to add to 100%, the Financials decline has lead to gains elsewhere in the total earnings pie. How much of an effect is that on the rest of the field? Well, the Consumer Staples sectors total earnings were virtually identical to its total earnings a year ago. However this year it was responsible for 9.9% of a smaller pie versus 7.7% of total earnings last year.
"
1846,AIG,"Things are also falling apart for the Discretionary firms, the only other sector with a smaller sized slice of the earnings pie this year. This is even despite the massive forced lending program known as the stimulus checks. Total net income for the sector is expected to be down 63.2% from a year ago, and even worse showing than the 18.8% year-over-year decline posted in the first quarter. The 63.3% decline is actually an improvement over the 82.2% decline the sector has posted so far. This year the sector has gathered less than 1.3% of all earnings for the quarter, down from 5.9% last year. Since the sector accounts for the bulk of the firms still left to report, that share should grow slightly for both this year an last, but not enough to change the conclusion that is was a very bad quarter for the Discretionary firms.
"
1847,AIG,"Total net income for all the S&P 500 firms that have reported so far is $164.3 billion versus $211.4 billion a year ago. That is, however, a slight improvement on a sequential basis from the $161.3 billion these same 461 firms posted in the first quarter.
"
1848,AIG,"Looking ahead to the expectations for the third quarter, it looks like we will have another down quarter, but not anywhere near as ugly as the last three have been. Currently a 0.57% decline is expected, but that picture is misleading. All of the improvement (such as it is) is expected to come from two sources. The Financials are expected to suck just a little bit less (dont count on that happening) with a decline of 42.7% from a year ago. Energy is expected to post eye popping growth of 52.2%, which will be a very tall order indeed, especially with oil prices slipping in recent weeks. No other sector is expected to post more than 6.0% growth.
"
1849,AIG,"On the plus side, that does not seem like that big a hurdle. We may be setting up for many positive surprises in the third quarter.

"
1851,AIG,"To help gauge the direction of the market, we take note of what analysts are thinking. By tallying their EPS changes, we can determine our revisions ratio. This ratio simply divides the total number of positive estimate revisions by the total number of estimate cuts. Thus, a high ratio is a bullish indicator and a low ratio is bearish. For the S&P 500 as a whole, a number below 0.80 or above 1.25 is generally significant. For individual sectors the distance from 1.0 should be greater for the numbers to be significant.
"
1852,AIG,"With positive surprises outnumbering disappointments by almost 5:2, it is not a shock that the revisions ratio has started to climb from the depths. After all second quarter earnings are part of full year 2008 earnings, so if a company posts a positive surprise and the analysts dont raise full year earnings, they are implicitly cutting estimates for the third or fourth quarters. It is now at 1.08, a reading that is neutral, up from 1.05 last week, and 0.98 two weeks ago.
"
1853,AIG,"The overall pace of estimate revisions continues its rise, and is approaching its seasonal peak. Over the last four weeks there have been 3,727 changes in estimates (1,939 up and 1,788 down), up 3.5% from 3,600 last week (1,841 up and 1,759 down). This week should mark the peak of total revisions activity for the quarter. The ratio of firms with rising mean estimates to falling mean estimates is 1.02, slightly weaker than the revisions ratio, but also in neutral territory.
"
1854,AIG,"On the back of their strong surprise ratios, Health Care and Industrials have moved into the top slots for the 2008 revisions ratio, with readings of 2.94 and 2.57, respectively. Surprises have not been as strong for Energy (2.4:1 ratio, 2.65% median surprise), but it still has a respectable reading of 1.26. Still this is way down from where it was a month or two ago, as lower oil prices work their way into analysts forecasts for this year. Financials and Discretionary are the weak sisters with readings of 0.53 and 0.74, respectively. However, these readings represent a significant improvement over what we were seeing before earnings season.
"
1855,AIG,"Notable Health Care stocks on the upside include Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report), St. Jude (STJ) and Wyeth (WYE).

1856,AIG,"In the Consumer Discretionary sector, the analysts slammed the brakes on the Auto companies Ford (F  -  Free Report) and General Motors (GM). In the Financials many of the regional banks continue to get hit, with noteworthy declines in National City (NCC), Regions Financial (RF  -  Free Report), Washington Mutual (WM) and Zion (ZION  -  Free Report).

1858,AIG,"Unlike 2008, there is no mechanical reason for analysts to raise their numbers for 2009 in response to an earnings surprise. While it did rise, it remains at the boarder between negative and neutral territory. It rose to, 0.80, from 0.79 last week, and 0.76 two weeks ago.
"
1859,AIG,"Health Care takes over at the top of the revisions ratio standings for 2009 this week with a reading of 1.90, while Energy slipped to second with 1.62. Health Care stars include Biogen Idec (BIIB), Express Scripts (ESRX) and St. Jude (STJ). Noteworthy Energy names on the rise include, Baker Hughes (BHI), Massey (MEE) and Southwestern (SWN  -  Free Report).
"
1860,AIG,"The revisions picture for the Financial sector is even worse for 2009 than it is for 2008, coming in at 0.28, or almost four cuts for every increase. Revisions like these will eat away at the robust earnings rebound seen for 2009 (unless 2008 gets cut faster). If the Financials were excluded, the revisions index would pop to 1.01. We do not seem to be getting out of the woods on the Financial sector front. While there is weakness throughout the sector, some losers worth noting this week include American International Group (AIG), E-Trade (ETFC  -  Free Report), Genworth (GNW  -  Free Report) and Metlife (MET  -  Free Report).
"
1861,AIG,"The total number of revisions for the whole S&P 500 for 2009 is also near its seasonal peak. There were a total of 3,221 revisions: 1,438 up and 1,788 down. This is up 4.3% from 3,087 (1,360 up and 1,727 down) last week.. The ratio of firms with rising mean estimates to falling mean estimates is 0.78, in line with the revisions ratio.

"
1863,AIG,"When making investment decisions, growth should always be looked at in conjunction with how much you are paying for a stock. Thus, it makes sense to look at the total earnings expected for a sector, relative to that sectors total market capitalization. This is basically a variation on looking at the P/E.
"
1864,AIG,"The chart below shows the share of total earnings for 2007, 2008 and 2009, as well as the share of total market capitalization for each sector (the final bar shown). Since the S&P 500 is a market cap weighted index, this is the same as its index weight. On the chart below, the difference between the sizes of the first three bars shows if a sector is gaining or losing ""earnings share"". The difference between the final bar and the first three bars shows if the sector is selling for an above or below market P/E. If the final bar is smaller than the other bars, the sector is selling for a below market P/E. However, as opposed to just showing the sector P/Es, it also shows the relative importance of the sectors to the overall index.
"
1865,AIG,"For years, the Financials were the dominate force in the market, both in terms of market cap, and even more so in terms of total earnings. They have now been decisively dethroned on both counts. On the Market cap front it just recaptured second place from Energy. However, it has now slipped into fifth place based on 2008 earnings. Still, despite their current problems, the Financials are still a very significant influence on the market.
"
1866,AIG,"Even with all the disasters in the sector, for 2007, the Financials accounted for 21.8% of the total net income for the S&P 500. In 2008, that is currently expected to decline to 8.8% before rebounding to 17.2% in 2009. However, in recent years the sector has accounted for well over a quarter of all earnings.
"
1867,AIG,"Energy has usurped the crown this year, with its earnings share climbing to 22.4% from 15.6% in 2007. Energy should keep the earnings crown for 2009 as well, gathering 20.0% of all the earnings of the S&P 500.
"
1868,AIG,"On the market cap (and index weight) front, Tech overtook the Financials a few months ago and currently stands at 17.7%. The Financials have plunged to 14.1% of the index. Energy has the third highest weighting at 13.1%. As recently as the end of February, Financials had a 17.2% index weighting versus 15.7% for Tech and 13.0% for Energy.
"
1869,AIG,"Keep in mind that these numbers are snapshots, when you should be thinking about a movie. At the end of February (the first time we had a complete read on 2009), the Financials were expected to gather 22.1% of all earnings for 2008, and Energy was expected to only get 16.0%. For 2009, the expected earnings shares were 15.0% for Energy and 22.4% for Financials. A year ago before the credit crunch hit, Financials were expected to gather 26.3% of 2008 earnings and held a 19.4% weighting in the index. Energy represented just 10.9% of the total market capitalization and was expected to get 12.9% of the total earnings in 2008.  In general it seems as if the Energy sector is consistently gaining at least 0.2% of share for each year every week, with a similar decline for the Financials. If those trends continue, then Energy could be as dominate on the earnings front in 2008 and 2009 as the Financials were in 2007 or 2006.
"
1870,AIG,"For many years Financials were clearly the dominate factor in the overall market, despite generally selling for below market P/Es. Due to an implosion in earnings that has been far worse than the dismal market performance of the sector, the Financials now have the highest P/Es based on 2008 earnings, displacing the perennial high P/E sector Technology.  Based on 2008 earnings, the Financials have a P/E of 24.7x. However, given the expectation that the bleeding will stop next year, the P/E based on 2009 earnings is just 9.9x. Given the pace of estimate cuts in the sector, the true P/E is probably higher since the actual earnings will be significantly lower.
"
1871,AIG,"Energy has just taken the throne as the cheapest based on 2008 earnings trading at 9.0x, and 7.9x based on 2009 expectations. There is no question in my mind that Energy is the cheapest sector of the market, and every portfolio should be overweight in it. The Tech sector is still a bit on the expensive side, trading for 18.2x 2008 and 15.5x 2009 expectations. Health Care looks interesting trading at 14.6x 2008 and 13.3x 2009 earnings.
"
1872,AIG,"Keep your eyes on the revisions, they give you the best clue as to if the earnings will be achieved and if the P/Es are for real. While the recent declines in oil prices may cause the upwards revisions to moderate for the Energy sector, most analysts are using very conservative price assumptions.
"
1873,AIG,"The S&P 500 as a whole is trading for 15.3x and 12.1x, 2008 and 2009 earnings, respectively. Based on a blend of 50% 2008 earnings and 50% 2009 earnings; that translates to a 7.30% earnings yield, which looks extremely cheap relative to a 3.84% ten year T-note. Even against the A rated corporate bond yield of 6.05% it looks attractive. However, the current level of expectations for corporate earnings still implies that profits will stay well above their historical averages as a share of GDP. That would be an exceedingly rare occurrence during a recession. The comparison between the earnings yield on the S&P and the 10 year T-note is in my opinion more a reflection of the extreme unattractiveness of long term T-notes at this point than stocks looking particularly cheap in general, however there are attractive stocks out there. It appears that the flight to quality has caused a massive bubble in the price of T-notes. This is far and away, in my opinion, the most significant bubble in the market today, not the price of oil. The prices are hard to justify given the risk that the massive injections of liquidity by the Fed to ameliorate the credit crunch will end up fueling the fires of inflation.

"
1876,AIG,"In China, 8 is considered a lucky number. As of Friday, 8/8/08, we were 88.8% done with the second quarter earnings season. The results have been mixed; encouraging in median EPS growth terms, but downright awful in terms of total net income growth.
"
1877,AIG,"Positive surprises are leading disappointments by a 2.4:1 ratio, which is only slightly below recent historical norms. The median surprise is also inline with recent history at 3.09%.
"
1878,AIG,"The median year-over-year EPS growth rate of 9.45% is wonderful news for the market. And it looks like it will probably hold up. Given the expectations for those that have yet to report that seems possible. The median expected EPS growth rate for the firms that are yet to report is 16.9%. Given the propensity for positive surprises to outnumber disappointments, on a median EPS basis, double-digit growth is possible.
"
1879,AIG,"Energy is finished reporting and currently holds the gold medal spot with growth of 25.4%. Tech is in silver, with median EPS growth of 22.2%. This is based on the results of 60 companies, or 84.5% of the total Tech firms in the index. Absent some significant positive surprises it seems unlikely to overtake Energy in the median EPS growth event. Telecom is in the bronze medal spot with 17.8%, and it should hold on to its place on the podium.
"
1880,AIG,"On the surprise front, two sectors have been particularly impressive. Health Cares median EPS growth rate is 14.3%.  Health Care is showing more than 6 positive surprises for each disappointment, with a median surprise of 4.69%. This is not based on just a handful or results either, as over 98% of Health Care reports are already in. The Industrials have been just as impressive, with growth of 13.6%, a 7.0 surprise ratio and a 5% median surprise.
"
1881,AIG,"The Financials have been the weakest sector by far, with the median EPS dropping by 17.4% from a year ago. The sector is responsible for one third of all the earnings disappointments to this point. The Consumer Discretionary sector is the only other one to show negative year-over-year growth on a median EPS basis (-4.3%).
"
1882,AIG,"The expected results for the remaining Financials are even worse the ones which have already reported, at -156.2%, but relatively few remain. The remaining Consumer Discretionary firms are expected to show a 1.1% increase, meaning that there should not be a big change from what has already been reported.
"
1883,AIG,"Some of the factors which should help median EPS growth are share repurchases, which though have slowed in recent months, will still reflect what happened last year. Oddly, increased share counts will also help boost EPS among the Financials. Since the ones that have increased their share counts the most (by going hat in had to the sovereign wealth funds looking for new capital) are also the ones that are likely to reports losses, so the loss per share will be less.
"
1884,AIG,"In addition, to the extent that firms have large operations overseas, they should benefit from the currency translation effects of the weak dollar. The weak dollar has also boosted those companies that export a substantial portion of their sales.
"
1885,AIG,"Keep in mind that median growth rates are inherently equally weighted, so the growth rate for Cabot Oil and Gas (COG) is just as significant to the results for the Energy sector as the growth rate for Exxon (XOM  -  Free Report).

"
1887,AIG,"While on a median EPS growth basis, things might look okay, the same is not true on a total net income basis. This is shaping up to be yet another very ugly quarter.
"
1888,AIG,"The blame for net income decline once again goes to the Financials (with best supporting actor nomination for the Consumer Discretionary). On a percentage basis, total earnings have collapsed even more for the Discretionary firms (-83.5%) than for the Financials (-81.9%). However, the Financials are normally a much bigger sector in terms of total profits. Last year, the Financials accounted for 27.4% of all net income reported at this point, this year they account for just 6.3%. By contrast, last year the Discretionary firms chipped in just 5.9% of all earnings. Overall, the second quarter is even weaker than the first quarter.
"
1889,AIG,"Total net income for the S&P 500 is expected to be 21.0% below the second quarter of 2007, which is not much of a change from the 20.8% decline posted so far. This is a weaker overall showing than in the first quarter (down 15.6%) and roughly inline with the fourth-quarter decline of 21.2%).
"
1890,AIG,"Looking ahead, the consensus is currently for very weak but positive growth in net income (up 2.2%), thanks to very high expectations for the Energy sector, and the Financials only being kicked in the stomach, not a little lower on the anatomy.
"
1891,AIG,"Total net income for all the S&P 500 firms that have reported so far is $161.8 billion versus $204.2.4 billion a year ago. That is however a slight improvement on a sequential basis from the $158.7 billion these same 444 firms posted in the first quarter. While the overall pie is smaller, the size of the slices has moved dramatically. With the Financials share shrinking dramatically, the shares for most other sectors have expanded. Energy is getting the biggest slice, almost 26%, up from 17.5% a year ago. Techs slice of the pie is up to 14.2% from 9.4% a year ago.
"
1892,AIG,"Surprisingly, Tech is leading in total net income growth reported so far, up 19.1%. Energy is in the Silver medal spot, but Tech is expected to fade at the end allowing it to take the gold. Health Care should make the platform, but with a distant third of 8.3% growth, but taking the second largest slice of the pie at 15.2%.

"
1894,AIG,"To help gauge the direction of the market, we take note of what analysts are thinking. By tallying their EPS changes, we can determine our revisions ratio. This ratio simply divides the total number of positive estimate revisions by the total number of estimate cuts. Thus, a high ratio is a bullish indicator and a low ratio is bearish. For the S&P 500 as a whole, a number below 0.80 or above 1.25 is generally significant. For individual sectors the distance from 1.0 should be greater for the numbers to be significant.
"
1895,AIG,"With positive surprises outnumbering disappointments by almost 5:2, it is not a shock that the revisions ratio has started to climb from the depths. After all second quarter earnings are part of full year 2008 earnings, so if a company posts a positive surprise and the analysts dont raise full year earnings, they are implicitly cutting estimates for the third or fourth quarters.
"
1896,AIG,"The ratio is now at 1.05, a reading that is neutral, up from 0.98 last week, and 0.81 two weeks ago. The overall pace of estimate revisions continues its rise, and is approaching its seasonal peak. Over the last four weeks there have been 3,600 changes in estimates: 1,841 up and 1,759 down. (In comparison, last week there were 3,017 changes: 1,521 up and 1,556. This week or next should mark the peak of total revisions activity for the quarter. The ratio of firms with rising mean estimates to falling mean estimates is 0.95, slightly weaker than the revisions ratio, but also in neutral territory.
"
1897,AIG,"On the back of their strong surprise ratios, Health Care and Industrials have moved into the top slots for the 2008 revisions ratio, with readings of 3.11 and 2.24. Surprises have not been as strong for Energy (1.7:1 ratio, 1.42% median surprise), but it still has a respectable reading of 1.40. Financials and Discretionary are the weak sisters with readings of 0.49 and 0.63, respectively.
"
1898,AIG,"Notable Health Care stocks on the upside include Abbott Labs (ABT), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) and St. Jude (STJ). The Aerospace and Defense names were particularly strong among the Industrials, including General Dynamics (GD), Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report) and Raytheon (RTN  -  Free Report).
"
1899,AIG,"In the Consumer Discretionary sector, the analysts checked out of the hotel companies Marriot (MAR  -  Free Report) and Starwood (HOT). The Financials included in the Dow 30 seemed under particular pressure, including American International Group (AIG), American Express (AXP), Citigroup (C), and J.P. Morgan (JPM  -  Free Report).

1901,AIG,"Unlike 2008, there is no mechanical reason for analysts to raise their numbers for 2009 in response to an earnings surprise. While it did rise, it remains in negative territory. It rose to, 0.79, from 0.76 last week, and 0.66 two weeks ago.
"
1902,AIG,"The Energy sector, with a revisions ratio of 2.15, remains the strongest. Health Care also put in a decent showing at 1.91 Energy firms showing noteworthy strength include the Oil Service majors, Baker Hughes (BHI), Halliburton (HAL  -  Free Report), National Oilwell Varco (NOV  -  Free Report) and Schlumberger (SLB  -  Free Report).
"
1903,AIG,"The revisions picture for the Financial sector is even worse for 2009 than it is for 2008, coming in at 0.24, or over four cuts for every increase. Revisions like these will eat away at the robust earnings rebound seen for 2009 (unless 2008 gets cut faster). If the Financials were excluded, the revisions index would pop to 1.04. We do not seem to be getting out of the woods on the Financial sector front. While there is weakness throughout the sector, major regional banks seem to be the worst hit. In particular, weakness at BB&T (BBT), Comerica (CMA), SunTrust (STI  -  Free Report), Regions Financial (RF  -  Free Report) and Zion (ZION  -  Free Report) was noteworthy.

1904,AIG,"The total number of revisions for the whole S&P 500 for 2009 is also near its seasonal peak. There were a total of 3,087 revisions: 1,360 up and 1,727 down.

"
1906,AIG,"When making investment decisions, growth should always be looked at in conjunction with how much you are paying for a stock. Thus, it makes sense to look at the total earnings expected for a sector, relative to that sectors total market capitalization. This is basically a variation on looking at the P/E.
"
1907,AIG,"The chart below shows the share of total earnings for 2007, 2008 and 2009, as well as the share of total market capitalization for each sector (the final bar shown). Since the S&P 500 is a market cap weighted index, this is the same as its index weight. On the chart below, the difference between the sizes of the first three bars shows if a sector is gaining or losing earnings share. The difference between the final bar and the first three bars shows if the sector is selling for an above or below market P/E. If the final bar is smaller than the other bars, the sector is selling for a below market P/E. However, as opposed to just showing the sector P/Es, it also shows the relative importance of the sectors to the overall index.
"
1908,AIG,"For years, the Financials were the dominate force in the market, both in terms of market cap, and even more so in terms of total earnings. They have now been decisively dethroned on both counts. On the market cap front, Financials just recaptured 2nd place from Energy. However, the sector has now slipped into 5th place based on 2008 earnings. Still, despite their current problems, the Financials are still a very significant influence on the market.
"
1909,AIG,"Even with all the disasters in the sector, for 2007, the Financials accounted for 21.9% of the total net income for the S&P 500. In 2008, that is currently expected to decline to 11.0% before rebounding to 17.4% in 2009. However, in recent years the sector has accounted for well over a quarter of all earnings.
"
1910,AIG,"Energy has usurped the crown this year, with its earnings share climbing to 21.8% from 15.6% in 2007. Energy should keep the earnings crown for 2009 as well, gathering 20.0% of all the earnings of the S&P 500.
"
1911,AIG,"On the market cap (and index weight) front, Tech overtook the Financials a few months ago and currently stands at 17.6%. The Financials have plunged to 14.7% of the index. As recently as the end of February, Financials had a 17.2% index weighting versus 15.7% for Tech and 13.0% for Energy.
"
1912,AIG,"Keep in mind that these numbers are snapshots, when you should be thinking about a movie. At the end of February (the first time we had a complete read on 2009), the Financials were expected to gather 22.1% of all earnings for 2008, and Energy was expected to only get 16.0%. For 2009, the expected earnings shares were 15.0% for Energy and 22.4% for Financials. A year ago, before the credit crunch hit, Financials were expected to gather 26.3% of 2008 earnings and held a 19.4% weighting in the index.
"
1913,AIG,"Energy represented just 10.9% of the total market capitalization and was expected to get 12.9% of the total earnings in 2008.  In general it seems as if the Energy sector is consistently gaining 0.2% of share for each year every week, with a similar decline for the Financials. If those trends continue, then Energy could be as dominate on the earnings front in 2008 and 2009 as the Financials were in 2007 or 2006.
"
1914,AIG,"For many years, Financials were clearly the dominate factor in the overall market, despite generally selling for below market P/Es. Due to an implosion in earnings that has been far worse than the dismal market performance of the sector, the Financials now have the highest P/Es based on 2008 earnings, displacing the perennial high P/E sector Technology. Based on 2008 earnings, the Financials have a P/E of 19.4x. However, given the expectation that the bleeding will stop next year, the P/E based on 2009 earnings is just 10.0x. (The true P/E is probably higher since the actual earnings will be significantly lower.)
"
1915,AIG,"Energy has just taken the throne as the cheapest based on 2008 earnings trading at 8.8x, and 7.8x based on 2009 expectations. There is no question in my mind that Energy is the cheapest sector of the market, and every portfolio should be overweight in it. The Tech sector is still a bit on the expensive side, trading for 17.7x 2008 and 15.1x 2009 expectations. Health Care looks interesting trading at 14.4x 2008 and 13.0x 2009 earnings.
"
1916,AIG,"Keep your eyes on the revisions, they give you the best clue as to if the earnings will be achieved and if the P/Es are for real. While the recent declines in oil prices may cause the upwards revisions to moderate for the Energy sector, most analysts are using very conservative price assumptions.
"
1917,AIG,"The S&P 500 as a whole is trading for 14.6x and 11.7x 2008 and 2009 earnings, respectively. Based on a blend of 50% 2008 earnings and 50% 2009 earnings; that translates to a 7.60% earnings yield, which looks extremely cheap relative to a 3.93% ten year T-note. Even against the A rated corporate bond yield of 6.11% it looks attractive. However, the current level of expectations for corporate earnings still implies that profits will stay well above their historical averages as a share of GDP. That would be an exceedingly rare occurrence during a recession. The comparison between the earnings yield on the S&P and the 10 year T-note is in my opinion more a reflection of the extreme unattractiveness of long term T-notes at this point than stocks looking particularly cheap in general, however there are attractive stocks out there. It appears that the flight to quality has caused a massive bubble in the price of T-notes. This is far and away, in my opinion, the most significant bubble in the market today, not the price of oil. The prices are hard to justify given the risk that the massive injections of liquidity by the Fed to ameliorate the credit crunch will end up fueling the fires of inflation.

"
1947,AIG,"If taken at face value, the expectations are for median earnings growth to slow to high single digits in the third quarter. However, we have been down this road before, in just about every quarter it looks like we will have a big slowdown before the results come in, and in every quarter the voice of Gomer Pile kicks in with ""Surprise, Surprise, Surprise"". 
"
1948,AIG,"At the same point in each of the last six quarters, earnings for the current fiscal quarter were supposed to slow significantly, and into the single digits in five of them. The actual range of expected median year-over-year growth has been exceptionally narrow. The worst expected growth was for the first quarter of this year at 8.33% (the actual was 10.0%) and the best was 10.1% for the fourth quarter of 2006 (actual was 12.9%). Given that history, it is hard to get overly concerned about the median expected growth rate for the third quarter being down at 9.1%, even if that is sharply lower than the 13.5% growth we enjoyed in the second quarter. That being said, there is still some useful information if we look at the relative expectations among the sectors. Health Care (14.2%) and Industrials (12.7%) are expected to lead the pack, with Tech (10.5%) and Materials (10.3%) joining them in the double-digit club. However, only for Materials would that represent an acceleration from the second-quarter pace. Three sectors - Utilities, Financials and Consumer Discretionary - are expected to drop from double-digit growth in the second quarter, to below 5% growth in the third quarter. The Telecom sector, which can be flaky given the small number of firms in it, is expected to have the best acceleration of growth, rising from negative 14.4% to a positive 6.6%. We would note that the three sectors with the highest expected growth for the third quarter are also the three sectors with the highest revisions ratios for this year. This tends to add to the confidence that those sectors will have solid growth.
"
1949,AIG,"The second-quarter earnings season was a very good one. A total of 488 companies in the S&P 500 have reported1, or 97.6% of the total. Given that there are always a few firms that have delayed filings, this means that effectively the season is over. As in recent quarters, positive surprises dominate disappointments, currently by a ratio of 3.5:1, roughly in line with a week ago.  The median surprise is a very healthy 3.45%. The median growth rate is far higher than was expected as we entered the earning season, currently standing at 13.5%, while high single digit growth was expected. The current reading is the same as last week, but well above what we were seeing early in the earnings season. This was the 20th quarter, a.k.a. five years, of consecutive double-digit growth in median year-over-year EPS growth for S&P 500 firms. The good results were very wide spread. In terms of growth, every sector but Telecom is showing near double-digit median year-over-year EPS growth. Every sector is showing more positive surprises than disappointments, and the worst showing is in Materials at 2:1.
"
1950,AIG,"The leading sector for growth was Energy, with median growth of 20.4%. The sector also boasts the second the highest median surprise at 7.18%. While growth is expected to decelerate sharply to just 3.8% in the third quarter, with the price of oil remaining well above $70 for most of the third quarter, this sector would be a good candidate for positive surprises. Health Care is also having a very strong season with median growth of 16.7%, positive surprises out pacing disappointments by almost 4:1 with a median surprise of 4.07%. With all of the results in, the Industrial sector is enjoying a surprise ratio of over 8:1, a median surprise of 3.27% and a none to shabby median growth rate of 14.8%. Both of these sectors are expected to post strong results in the third quarter as well.
"
1951,AIG,"We would note that while U.S. economic growth may slow sharply in the third quarter due to housing and mortgage problems, worldwide economic growth remains exceptionally strong. Most S&P 500 firms have substantial overseas activities that benefit from that strong growth. In addition, the dollar is much weaker than it was a year ago and many firms will benefit from currency translation. A weak dollar also tends to lead to higher commodity prices (since commodities are denominated in dollars) which will help the earnings of commodity oriented firms. Share repurchases should also continue to support EPS growth in the third quarter.

"
1953,AIG,"To help gauge the direction of the market, we take note of what analysts are thinking. By tallying their EPS changes, we can determine our ""revisions ratio"". This ratio simply divides the total number of positive estimate revisions by the total number of estimate cuts. Thus, a high ratio is a bullish indicator and a low ratio is bearish. For the S&P 500 as a whole, a number below 0.80 or above 1.25 is generally significant. For individual sectors the distance from 1.0 should be greater for the numbers to be significant.
"
1954,AIG,"For fiscal 2007, the revisions ratio continues to plunge, to 0.86 from 1.07 last week, and from 1.40 two weeks ago. While that is still in what we consider the neutral zone, it is a very significant decline, particularly when more than just one weeks change is considered. It appears that the recent turmoil in the credit market is starting to have an impact on earnings expectations.  Part of it, however, is also estimate increases made over a month ago in response to better than expected earnings falling out of the sample. As earnings season ends, analysts make far fewer estimate revisions, so the fall off effect is generally bigger than the new estimate effect. Over the last four weeks, there were 560 upward EPS revisions and 654 downward, for 1,214 revisions total. This was a 27% decrease in total revisions from last week, which was in turn 44% lower than the week before. We are clearly past the peak of revisions activity, and probably approaching the nadir for this quarter. Remember that these ratios are moving four week totals, so last weeks reading is not totally independent from this weeks (three weeks of overlap). When the focus is shifted away from the number of estimates changed, to the number of firms with rising mean estimates to falling estimates, the ratio is 0.91, down from the 1.04 we saw last week, and 1.34 two weeks ago. In other words the two measures of estimate revisions activity are consistent with each other, both in terms of magnitude and change. 
"
1955,AIG,"The revisions ratios were above 1.0 for only four sectors, down from nine in each of the last two weeks. Industrials continue to lead, although their revisions ratios slipped significantly from a week ago. They are currently at 2.52, well below the very impressive revisions ratios of 3.17. Tech takes the silver this week, with a revisions ratio of 1.86. It was also the only sector where the revisions ratio improved this week, up from 1.58 last week. Materials took the basement slot both with a ratio of 0.35, indicating almost three cuts for every increase. The Financial Services sector, which should be the sector most directly affected by the trouble in mortgageland plunged to 0.45 this week from 0.85 last week. While the precise location of all the losses have not yet been ascertained for most of those losses, one has to assume that they reside primarily within the Financial sector. A closer look reveals that what strength there is in the Financials is concentrated among the Insurance firms, particularly American International Group (AIG  -  Free Report), which alone was responsible for 20% of all the estimate increases for the sector, while the banks and brokers are on the weak side.

However, it is still neutral territory, but the trend is not a good one. As with the 2007 revisions, we are past the quarterly peak in activity. There were 486 upward revisions and 593 cuts for 2008, making the total number of FY2 revisions over the last month 1,079, down 28% from last week. The Industrial sector was the clear leader with a revisions ratio of 2.61, actually up slightly from 2.50 last week. It has more than twice as many firms with rising than falling mean estimates. Four other sectors had more upward than downward revisions; Utilities, Tech, and Telecom all had revisions ratios above 1.0, although Telecom and Utilities are better characterized as neutral than positive. The Financials were clearly the weakest, with almost three times as many cuts as increases.

1959,AIG,"On a full-year3 basis, median earnings growth for the S&P 500 is expected to remain healthy. On a total basis however, growth is expected to slump into the high single digits for 2007 and then rebound in 2008. 
"
1960,AIG,"There are a couple of technical points which are affecting the expected growth rates. Recently firms have been pumping enormous, and unprecedented, sums into share repurchases. In 2006, over $432 billion was spent by S&P 500 firms to buy back their own stock. These buybacks amount to 3.4% of the S&P 500s year-end 2006 value and have the effect of increasing 2006/2005 EPS growth rates by approximately 3.5%. All indications are that buybacks will have a similar effect on 2007 earnings growth.

1961,AIG,"On a total earnings basis, growth is expected to show a far sharper deceleration in 2007 than on a median earnings basis. Total earnings are expected to be 9.2% in 2007, following 16.3% growth in 2006. Next year total earnings growth is expected to rebound to 11.7%. On a median earnings basis, growth in 2007 is expected to be 12.5% slightly below with the growth posted in 2006. All three of the sectors which posted greater than 20% growth in 2006 on a total earnings basis are expected to see growth fall to the single digits.  In the Materials and Energy sectors, growth measured on a median basis is far healthier than if measured on a total earnings basis, which is in large part due to the concentration of a high percentage of the total earnings for the sector in a few firms in those sectors. Only three sectors are expected to post total earnings growth of greater than 10% in 2007, down from seven double-digit growth sectors in 2006. Interestingly the total earnings growth for those sectors is very close to the median growth expected for those sectors. Looking forward to next year, the Consumer Discretionary sector is expected to post a big snap back, to 21.3% growth from only 1.5% growth this year. This is mostly from hopes of a turnaround in the homebuilding industry. Count us as dubious on that proposition. The total expected earnings growth for the energy sector for this year is 7.65% which is a bit below that of the overall market, however, it has been growing steadily over the course of the year. Six months ago, the total earnings for the sector were excepted be down 0.91% in 2007.

"
1963,AIG,"When making investment decisions, growth should always be looked at in conjunction with how much you are paying for a stock. Thus, it makes sense to look at the total earnings expected for a sector, relative to that sectors total market capitalization. This is basically a variation on looking at the P/E.
"
1964,AIG,"The chart below shows the share of total earnings for 2006, 2007 and 2008, as well as the share of total market capitalization for each sector (the final bar shown). Since the S&P 500 is a market cap weighted index, this is the same as its index weight. On the chart below, the difference between the sizes of the first three bars shows if a sector is gaining or losing earnings share. The difference between the final bar and the first three bars shows if the sector is selling for an above or below market P/E. If the final bar is smaller than the other bars, the sector is selling for a below market P/E. However, as opposed to just showing the sector P/Es, it also shows the relative importance of the sectors to the overall index. 
"
1965,AIG,"Clearly the Financials are the biggest influence on the market, comprising 19.3% of the total market capitalization of the S&P 500. However, that sector is also relatively cheap on an earnings basis, and thus serves to hold the overall P/E of the index down. In other words, Financials deserve to be the biggest influence on the market, since they contribute 26.9% of the total expected earnings for 2007, and 26.2% of the expected earnings for 2008. The Financials are the cheapest sector in the market followed Energy on a P/E basis. However, given recent events in the credit markets there have to be serious questions about how real the earnings are for many of the firms in the sector.
"
1966,AIG,"Energy looks to be under represented in its influence on the market since it is expected to provide 14.1% of the total earnings for 2007, but represents only 11.1% of the total market capitalization of the index. While its earnings share is currently expected to decline to approximately 13.1% in 2008, even on this basis it is still much cheaper than the overall market. Tech on the other hand represents 16.8% of the total market capitalization, but only 11.5% of the 2007, and 12.4% of the 2008 total earnings.
"
1967,AIG,"In more conventional terms, the Energy sector is trading for 12.2x 2007 and 11.8x 2008 earnings. The Financials are trading for 12.1x 2007 and 11.1x 2008 earnings. The S&P is trading for 15.6x and 13.9x, respectively (up from 14.9x and 13.0x tow weeks ago). Tech continues to be the most expensive sector trading at 22.8x and 19.0x 2007 and 2008 earnings, respectively. On a blended basis, the P/E for the overall market translates to an earnings yield of 6.85%, which is far more attractive than the 4.51% level available on a 10 year T-Note. However, keep in mind that these earning are after several years of very robust growth and corporate profits are near a record high percentage of GDP. If firms were to return to more normal levels of profitability, they would be much less attractively valued. The second chart below shows the sector P/Es ranked from lowest to highest based on estimated 2007 P/E ratios.

1968,AIG,"Matt Thurmond contributed significantly to this report.1 All data is as of the market close Thursday, Sep 6.
"
1969,AIG,"2The growth rates for the scorecard and the yet to report tables are based on median year-over-year EPS growth. The growth rates for the total earnings table are based on year-over-year growth in net income. Thus changes in shares outstanding (i.e. buybacks) can significantly affect the year-over-year growth in the scorecard, but would not affect the growth shown in the total earnings table.
"
1970,AIG,"3We follow the convention of referring to the most recently completed full fiscal year as ""2006"", and the next full fiscal year to be reported as ""2007"". It is thus possible for the ""actual 2006"" numbers to change as non-calendar fiscal year companies report their full year earnings. These changes can be particularly significant near mid year given the relatively large number of companies with June fiscal year ends.
"
1971,AIG,"American International Group, Inc. (AIG  -  Free Report) recently announced a new dividend policy in which the company will boost its common stock dividend by approximately 20% on an annual basis. AIG is currently yielding 0.96%. The Board also authorized the repurchase up to $8 billion in common stock. Consensus estimates for both this year and next are up over the past 30 days. AIGs return on equity of 16% tops the industry average of 13%.
"
1972,AIG,"Full Analysis
"
1973,AIG,"American International Group, Inc., through its subsidiaries, provides insurance and financial services in the United States and internationally. The company operates through four segments: General Insurance, Life Insurance and Retirement Services, Financial Services and Asset Management. AIG has operations in more than 130 countries and jurisdictions.
"
1974,AIG,"On Mar 1, AIG reported fourth-quarter earnings per share of $1.47. While the result missed the Streets estimate of $1.50, it marked a 153.4% year-over-year improvement when compared to profits of 58 cents per share in the prior-year period. Net premiums climbed 5.9% to $10.8 billion from $10.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2005. Net premiums earned rose 7.8% to $11.1 billion. 
"
1975,AIG,"For the entire year, AIG reported a profit of $14.05 billion, or $5.36 per share, compared with $10.48 billion, or $3.99 per share in 2005. On an adjusted basis, the company reported a profit of $15.41 billion, or $5.88 per share. Net premiums written increased 7.2% to $44.9 billion while net premiums earned advanced 6.6% to $43.5 billion. 
"
1976,AIG,"The companys combined ratio, a measure of profitability for insurance companies, for the fourth quarter improved to 91.7% from 96.2% in the fourth quarter 2005, excluding current period catastrophe-related losses and the reserve charge. For the full year, it improved to 89.1% from 93.2%. A ratio less than 100% indicates that the company is turning an underwriting profit, while a ratio greater than 100% indicates one that is paying out more money in claims versus receiving via premiums. 
"
1977,AIG,"The Board of Directors approved a new dividend policy in which the company, under ordinary circumstances, will boost its common stock dividend by approximately 20% on an annual basis. The new policy will become official with the common stock dividend declared in May of 2007. AIGs currently pays a quarterly dividend of 16.5 cents per share. The company has a current dividend yield of 0.96% and a five-year average dividend yield of 0.55%.
"
1978,AIG,"The Board also authorized the expansion of AIG's existing share repurchase program by allowing the company to repurchase up to $8 billion in common stock. AIG stated that it intends to buy back $5 billion in common stock during 2007.
"
1979,AIG,"The consensus estimate for this year currently resides at $6.34 and represents an eight-cent increase over the past 30 days. Profit forecasts for next year jumped 26 cents to $6.93 over the same period of time. Eight analysts upped their estimates for this year while four did so for next year. 
"
1980,AIG,"AIGs return on equity of 16% tops the industry average of 13%.
"
1981,AIG,"AIG is a Zacks #2 Rank (Buy) stock. Zacks #2 Rank stocks have generated an average annual return of 21.6% since 1988. Because the Zacks Rank has a market cap bias, Growth & Income investors may find a greater number of large-cap stocks by considering both Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) and Zacks #2 Rank (Buy) stocks in their selection criteria.
"
1982,AIG,"The importance of following earnings estimate revisions became very apparent this week. A simple practice of avoiding stocks with consistent negative revisions would have kept investors out of American International Group (AIG  -  Free Report), Lehman Brothers (LEH) and Washington Mutual (WM) - as well as many other beleaguered financial firms.
"
1983,AIG,"For many months, I've pointed out the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions for the financial sector. However, I realize it's one thing to tell you that our system worked and another for you to see the same results. Therefore, this week, I'm going to go over the warning signals, as they occurred, for each of the aforementioned stocks. And I'm going to use data that is available - for free - on Zacks.com.
"
1984,AIG,"AIG Forewarned Investors of Problems
"
1985,AIG,"Last February, in this column, I discussed how AIG warned about growing subprime-related losses. The firm revealed in a SEC filing that its internal model underestimated losses for two of its subsidiaries. The firm said new calculations suggested a potential loss of $5 billion, instead of $1.6 billion.
"
1986,AIG,"Brokerage analysts had previously started cutting their 2008 earnings estimates prior to the announcement, so investors should have been cautious about the stock. The announcement gave an additional reason to stay out of the stock. What followed was a rapid decline in expectations for AIG and a corresponding plunge in the stock's price.

"
1988,AIG,"Late Tuesday night, the Fed threw AIG a lifeline. The Federal Reserve is loaning the soon-to-be former Dow component $85 billion at interest rates that are equivalent to what many credit cards charge. For more information about the buyout, read my post on our Tale of the Tape Blog.
"
1989,AIG,"Reversal of Trend for Lehman
"
1990,AIG,"Until last fall, there had been a history of positive estimate revisions for Lehman Brothers. This trend had lasted for several years, before completely reversing.
"
1991,AIG,"To explain this trend, I'm going to show you the Price & Consensus chart for LEH. This chart shows the trend in estimate revisions and movement in a stock's price. Changes in earnings estimates are the shorter multi-color lines. The longer, continuous black line shows how Lehman's stock has traded.
"
1992,AIG,"What I like to see is an upward trend in estimate revisions and a corresponding move in the stock's price. This is what occurred with LEH between late 2003 and early 2008.
"
1993,AIG,"Starting in the summer, estimates for 2007 and 2008 started to weaken.
"
1994,AIG,"Then, throughout this year, forecasts for 2008 were continuously and sharply revised downward. As the outlook for Lehman worsened, its stock entered into a freefall. At any point last fall or winter, an investor looking at this chart would have had a big warning signal to get out of LEH.
"
1995,AIG,"A Lackluster History for Washington Mutual
"
1996,AIG,"What's interesting about Washington Mutual is that even when times were good, the stock never really rewarded shareholders. Between late 2003 and early 2007, there was not a meaningful difference in return between WM and a S&P 500 index fund.
"
1997,AIG,"The reason is that the company missed earnings expectations on several occasions, as the Price EPS Surprise chart shows.
"
1998,AIG,"The nearly routine negative surprises kept brokerage analysts from having much confidence in their earnings forecasts. As a result, even when the housing market in California was booming, the positive business momentum was not resulting in upwardly revised profit projections.
"
1999,AIG,"Conversely, when industry conditions turned against WaMu, brokerage analysts began cutting their forecasts en masse. After all, if a company failed to live up to expectations when times were good, it certainly isn't going to meet expectations when times are bad.
"
2000,AIG,"Lesson for Investors
"
2001,AIG,"Not all companies with negative estimate revisions will become the subject of bankruptcy rumors. However, many will disappoint and cost investors money. Given that all of the above information is available for free on Zacks.com, there is no reason for investors to ignore warning signs.
"
2002,AIG,"Though investing is often defined in terms of how one much makes, limiting losses also materially improves portfolio performance.
"
2003,AIG,"Positive Plays within the Financial Sector
"
2004,AIG,"Regular readers of this column know that I've been bearish on the financial sector since last year. The reason is that earnings estimates for the entire sector continue to be cut for both 2008 and 2009. Still, brokerage analysts are raising estimates on some financial companies.
"
2005,AIG,"One such company is American Financial Group (AFG  -  Free Report). Earnings estimates on this property and casualty (P&C) insurer continue to be revised higher for both 2008 and 2009. AFG has topped expectations nearly every quarter over the past five years, disappointing investors just twice. Best of all, the stock trades at about 7.5x 2009 earnings.
"
2006,AIG,"Northern Trust (NTRS  -  Free Report) may not seem like much of a bargain with its stock trading near a 52-week high. However, the company has a history of meeting or beating earnings estimates. Furthermore, profit projections for this year and next are being revised higher. NTRS provides asset management and investment advice to institutional investors and high net worth individuals.
"
2007,AIG,"Though both are Zacks #2 Rank (""buy"") stocks, I want to stress that investors should conduct further research before investing in either company. AFG missed expectations last quarter and could be exposed to claims from hurricane Ike. NTRS trades at 17x earnings and could be adversely affected if the financial crisis were to worsen.

2010,AIG,"The governments bailout of insurer American International Group Inc. (AIG  -  Free Report) did not ease investor concerns over financials. In fact, the bailout news sent financial stocks tumbling on worries that more despair in the financial sector is yet to come. 
"
2011,AIG,"Shares of Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) and Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) suffered some of the biggest blows even though MS released quarterly results that beat expectations and GS reported a profit, noting that it produced a solid performance in a tough environment. MS lost 24% for the day, while GS fell by 14%. 
"
2012,AIG,"Regarding the AIG rescue, the terms of the deal stipulate that the Fed will provide the insurer with a two-year $85 billion emergency loan at an interest rate of about 11.5%. In return, the government will receive a 79.9% stake in AIG and the right to remove senior management. AIG was down 45% for the day. 
"
2013,AIG,"News coming from the financial arena weighed on stocks, driving the Dows plunge of 449.36 points, or 4.06%. The blue chip index ended Wednesdays session at 10,609.66. 
"
2014,AIG,"Broader averages tanked as well. The Standard & Poor's 500 index slid by 57.21 points, or 4.71%, to 1,156.39, and the Nasdaq composite index declined by 109.05 points, or 4.94%, closing at 2,098.85.     
"
2015,AIG,"Carnage in stocks led investors to seek refuge in other areas, such as commodities. Gold shined brighter than ever today. The precious metal set a one-day record with a jump of $70, settling at $850.50 during trading. In after hours, it continued to soar higher.   
"
2016,AIG,"Market participants also sought safety in oil today. Light, sweet crude for October delivery spiked $6.01 to settle at $97.16 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. This is after plummeting by more than $5 on Tuesday. 
"
2017,AIG,"Zacks Elite Portfolios
"
2018,AIG,"The Focus List suffered along with the broader market. It dipped by 4.78%, which was pretty much in line with the S&P 500 and only a little wider than the Dows drop. 
"
2019,AIG,"Wall Streets bearish action is putting a strain on some of the Focus List holdings, leading us to execute a deletion on Flowserve (FLS). The company is being removed from both the Focus List and the Timely Buys list. Earnings estimates for 2009 were recently cut. More importantly, the stock's performance has not been good and we want to contain the current loss.
"
2020,AIG,"The current environment has also triggered a removal of Nucor (NUE  -  Free Report) from our Growth and Income portfolio. The companys stock has been hit hard in the commodities sell-off. We are deleting NUE to contain our losses. Fundamentals remain in place as 2008 estimates continue to rise with 5 out of 12 analysts raising estimates in the last week.
"
2021,AIG,"On the upside, Perrigo Co. (PRGO  -  Free Report) advanced 2.93% Wednesday after climbing 3.60% yesterday. The company was the subject of an analyst upgrade today. PRGO also recently announced that it acquired drug and nutritional products maker JB Laboratories for about $44 million in cash. PRGO mentioned that the acquisition is expected to add more than $70 million of annual sales.
"
2022,AIG,"Stocks stared into the abyss, again, and finally jumped in, as the financial crisis that has been percolating for weeks finally overwhelmed Wall Street. The Dow posted its largest one day drop since just after the September 11 attacks. 
"
2023,AIG,"The day started with an orderly sell-off that picked up steam in the second half of the session. No sector escaped the carnage.
"
2024,AIG,"The Dow lost 504 points, or 4.42%, to 10917. The Nasdaq Composite Index fared slightly better, giving up 81.36 points, or 3.60%, to 2179. The S&P 500 Index now finds itself below its July lows, shedding 59 points, or 4.71%, to 1192.
"
2025,AIG,"There were historic deals, and non-deals, all weekend long, as two of Wall Streets most revered investment banks threw in the towel. Lehman Brothers (LEH) declared bankruptcy after it couldn't find a partner who would take on its problems. Merrill Lynch (MER) fared better as Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report) came to its rescue.
"
2026,AIG,"All eyes now turn to American International Group (AIG  -  Free Report), the world's largest insurance company, which is desperately trying to raise capital. The State of New York, which regulates insurance companies, announced that it was giving AIG permission to tap $20 billion from subsidiaries in order to give it breathing room while it continued to look for its own White Knight. AIG has far broader financial implications, worldwide, if it were to fail, than Lehman Brothers' bankruptcy, due to its size and global reach.
"
2027,AIG,"Also on Wall Street's watch list are Wachovia (WB), whose stock was pummeled nearly 25% today, and Washington Mutual (WM). Both companies have large mortgage exposure. Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) released a memo to employees saying it had adequate capital which was not affected by the Lehman bankruptcy to try and quell jitters. The stock closed down 15% anyway.
"
2028,AIG,"If it wasn't for the financial crisis, the big news would have been Hurricane Ike, which struck the Texas coast over the weekend. Several million people in the Houston area are still without power. The energy complex fared pretty well considering the winds and storm surge. Fourteen Texas and Louisiana refineries, which refine 3.57 million barrels a day, remain closed. Most appear to have suffered only moderate damage. 
"
2029,AIG,"There are reports that about 10 offshore platforms were damaged but that is a small number out of the thousands in the region.
"
2030,AIG,"Oil continued to drop, closing under $100 a barrel for the first time since February. Oil for October delivery fell $5.47, or 5.4%, to $95.71. Oil has given up all of its gains in 2008 and is now down 35% from its all-time high in July of $147.27.
"
2031,AIG,"Natural gas traders had concerns about supply with the Gulf Coast pipelines being shut. Natural gas for October delivery rose 0.8 cents to $7.374 per million Btu.
"
2032,AIG,"Thankfully, the tropics are, for the moment, quiet. No tropical systems are expected to develop in the next 48 hours.
"
2033,AIG,"One bright spot during the session was the precious metals as traders looked for a safe haven. Gold rose for the second session in a row, gaining $22.50, or 2.9%, to $787 an ounce. Silver followed gold higher, rising 34 cents, or 3.1%, to $11.135 an ounce.The Focus List
"
2034,AIG,"There is no argument that todays bearish action took a toll on many portfolios. The Focus List was not spared. Its holdings averaged out a loss of 3.69% for the day. A tough loss, but one that was narrower than that of both the Dow (-4.42%) and S&P 500 (-4.71%) averages. The portfolio's dip was only slightly wider than the Nasdaqs (-3.60%) fall.

2035,AIG,"The weekends events translated into a rough Monday on Wall Street but not necessarily a call for panic. Discover what our panel of experts have to say about the Big Picture for Investors.
"
2036,AIG,"Amid the market carnage, Flowserve Corp. (FLS  -  Free Report) came in as todays biggest Focus List decliner, shedding 8.46%. This was for the most part a response to falling oil prices. However, we are watching this holding closely. It is tough to part with the Zacks #1 Rank (strong buy) stock that boasts strong fundamentals and is currently part of the Timely Buys list, but if bearish action persists, it will be removed.  
"
2037,AIG,"Focus List stocks that were in the news today included Railroad equipment supplier Wabtec Corp. (WAB  -  Free Report), which announced that it bought Standard Car Truck, a leading rail equipment supplier. The purchase was in the amount of $300 million in cash. 
"
2038,AIG,"Watson Wyatt Worldwide Inc. (WW) declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.075 per share for the quarter ended September 30, 2008. The company said the dividend is payable on October 15, to shareholders of record at the close of business on September 30.
"
2039,AIG,"In our Growth and Income portfolio, steel producer Nucor Corp. (NUE  -  Free Report) boosted its third-quarter earnings guidance by about 19%, referencing stronger overall performance, lower scrap metal prices and other factors. NUE noted that it expects earnings per share of $2.15 to $2.20, compared with its earlier forecast of $1.80 to $1.85 per share. 
"
2040,AIG,"It was a brutal day for stocks as the euphoria from the Fannie and Freddie bailout dissipated in response to renewed concerns about weakness in the financial sector. The Dow dropped 280 points to close at 11,231. 
"
2041,AIG,"Lehman Brothers Inc. (LEH) spooked the market when word spread that the troubled investment bank's negotiations with Korea Development Bank had stalled. Lehman has been aggressively pursuing additional capital in order to provide protection against deteriorating assets and strengthen its balance sheet. Lehman shares were down more than 40% on the day. 
"
2042,AIG,"The downtrend in the overall market and financial sector was hastened by American International Group Inc. (AIG  -  Free Report), as investors speculated that the world's largest insurer would also need to raise more capital to protect itself from exposure to mortgage related assets. AIG has already posted $20 billion in losses over the last three quarters and raised $20 billion in new capital.

2043,AIG,"On a more upbeat note, oil prices retreated below $104 for the first time since April as Hurricane Ike's trajectory veered away from sensitive, energy infrastructure in the Gulf. Also helping drive prices lower were comments from OPEC President Chakib Khelil, who insinuated that the organization will hold production at current levels. Crude dropped $3.08 on the day to close at $103.26 a barrel. 
"
2044,AIG,"And finally, the dollar ended a solid 2-week run against the Euro in today's session, as financial sector weakness eroded confidence in the Greenback. 
"
2045,AIG,"The Focus List
"
2046,AIG,"The Focus List portfolio saw declines in todays bearish market, averaging a loss of 4.43% for the day.
"
2047,AIG,"The commodities selloff environment has weighed on commodities related Focus List holdings. While many of these stocks continue to offer great fundamentals, falling commodity prices have caused us to execute a few deletions from the portfolio today. 
"
2048,AIG,"The indiscriminate selling in the commodity sector has hit CF Industries Holdings (CF  -  Free Report). Given the current backdrop and a recent trimming of Q3 estimates, we locking in a gain on CF in the Focus List. We hope to add the stock back at a later date.
"
2049,AIG,"Earnings estimates have been cut by 3 out of the 10 covering analysts recently on ConocoPhillips (COP  -  Free Report). We continue to like the valuation, but cannot justify holding onto COP given the current anti-commodity sentiment.
"
2050,AIG,"The indiscriminate selling that is occurring in commodity-related stocks is leading us to initiate a quick stop-loss on Fluor Corporation (FLR  -  Free Report). The market is clearly ignoring the company's positive fundamentals right now. We hope to add FLR back at a later date.
"
2051,AIG,"Though we continue to like the fundamentals on Genco Shipping &Trading Ltd. (GNK  -  Free Report), the indiscriminate selling in commodity-related stocks and a recent trimming of 2008 earnings estimates is causing us to close our position.
"
2052,AIG,"The indiscriminate selling that is occurring in commodity-related stocks is leading us to initiate a quick stop-loss on Metalico Inc. (MEA). The market is clearly ignoring the companys positive fundamentals right now. We hope to add MEA back at a later date.
"
2053,AIG,"In order to maintain sound diversification, we did not completely close off exposure to commodities and held onto such names as Bunge (BG  -  Free Report). Though, this pick was one of Tuesdays bigger Focus List decliners, analysts remain bullish on the farm and fertilizer stock as evidenced by the higher forecasts for this year and next. 
"
2054,AIG,"It was not all gloom and doom today. McDonalds Corp. (MCD  -  Free Report) was up 1.2% for the day as the fast food giant reported worldwide same-store sales surging 8.5% in August. 
"
2055,AIG,"Reports for the second quarter are starting to trickle in, and soon that trickle will turn to a flood as Alcoa kicked-off the second quarter earnings season.
"
2056,AIG,"At this point the reported data is not that significant. Just 32 firms, or 6.40% of the S&P 500, have reported. Nonetheless, this very limited sample is somewhat encouraging. Positive surprises are leading disappointments by a 3.2:1 ratio, inline with recent historical norms. The median surprise is also inline with recent history, and perhaps a bit better than normal at 4.04%. Expect both the surprise ratio and the median surprise to jump around quite a bit in the early going of the earnings season.
"
2057,AIG,"The median year-over-year EPS growth rate of 9.52% would be wonderful news for the market, if it can be held on to as the season progresses. Given the expectations for those that have yet to report that seems possible. The median expected EPS growth rate for the 93.6% of firms that are yet to report is 10.0%. Given the propensity for positive surprises to outnumber disappointments, on a median EPS basis, the second quarter earnings season could be far better than the mood of the market would seem to indicate.
"
2058,AIG,"Based on the early actual returns, Tech is winning the growth derby, with median EPS growth of 25.0%. However this is based on the results of only six companies, or 8.5% of the total Tech firms in the index, but five of those reported positive surprises. Only two Materials firms have reported but both had very nice positive surprises and put the sector in second place for growth so far.
"
2059,AIG,"At this point though it is the expectations for those that have yet to report that are more important than the few that have actually reported. Energy is currently expected to win the growth derby, not exactly a shocking idea with oil currently hovering in the $140 a barrel area. Perhaps the bigger question is: Why isnt the expected growth rate much higher than it is? After all, the price of crude has just about doubled since this time last year. Since it costs them something to get the oil out of the ground last year, one would expect that gross profits would more than double as a result. The 30.0% year over year growth in EPS for the sector looks very conservative to me.
"
2060,AIG,"Tech and Industrials are currently expected to win Silver and Bronze in the second quarter, with growth of 20.8% and 18.0%, respectively.
"
2061,AIG,"Once again, the biggest expected loser in the quarter is expected to be the Financials, with half the firms seeing a drop in their EPS of over 7.3%.
"
2062,AIG,"Consumer Durables follows with an expected drop of 0.7%. Given that the bulk of the stimulus checks are being mailed out in May and June, it would not surprise me if the retailers in the sector do a little bit better than expected for the quarter. However, even if that is the case, the effect would be short lived. The expected rebound to 3.4% growth in the third quarter seems to reflect slower assumptions about the pace of stimulus check disbursements than has actually happened.
"
2063,AIG,"Some of the factors which should help median EPS growth are share repurchases, which though have slowed in recent months, will still reflect what happened last year. Oddly, increased share counts will also help boost EPS among the Financials. Since the ones that have increased their share counts the most (by going hat in had to the sovereign wealth funds looking for new capital) are also the ones that are likely to reports losses, so the loss per share will be less.
"
2064,AIG,"In addition, to the extent that firms have large operations overseas, they should benefit from the currency translation effects of the weak dollar. The weak dollar has also boosted those companies that export a substantial portion of their sales.
"
2065,AIG,"Keep in mind that median growth rates are inherently equally weighted, so the growth rate for Cabot Oil and Gas (COG  -  Free Report) is just as significant to the results for the Energy sector as the growth rate for Exxon (XOM  -  Free Report).

"
2067,AIG,"Total net income for the S&P 500 is expected to fall for the third straight quarter. However, the magnitude of the decline is expected to be slightly less than we saw in either the first quarter or in last years fourth quarter.
"
2068,AIG,"The blame for net income decline once again goes to the Financials (with best supporting actor nomination for the Consumer Discretionary), but so does the credit for a less severe decline than last quarter.
"
2069,AIG,"Overall, total net income for the S&P 500 is expected to be 14.7% below the second quarter of 2007. This number is deteriorating rapidly, last week the decline was only expected to be 12.9%. In the Financial sector, total net income is expected to be 62.9% lower (was 56.9% last week). In both cases, this marks an improvement over the first quarter when the overall S&P 500 was down by 15.5% and the Financials were down 77.6%.
"
2070,AIG,"Things are also falling apart for the Discretionary firms, even despite the massive forced lending program known as the stimulus checks. Total net income for the sector is expected to be down 32.7% from a year ago, and even worse showing than the 18.8% year-over-year decline posted in the first quarter.
"
2071,AIG,"Looking at the reports in so far, (very small sample, so these are just very early indications) things look very bleak indeed for the Financials with the total net income of the five firms that have actually reported so far down 86.2% from a year ago. Those five firms reported a total of $902 million in profits this year versus $6.7 billion last year. There will be more massive write-offs this quarter, but hopefully not quite as massive as we have seen in the previous two quarters. The key flavor of the quarter this time around should be write-offs related to counterparty risk with the monocline insurance firms like Ambac (ABK) and MBIA (MBI) which have finally lost their AAA designations.
"
2072,AIG,"Total net income for all the S&P 500 firms that have reported so far is 39.4% below last year.
"
2073,AIG,"Energy is expected to be the strongest sector, with total net income climbing 20.0%. Analysts have been raising their sights for the sector rather dramatically. Just last week growth of only 19.1% was expected, and 15.8% growth was projected two weeks ago. However, that is significantly slower growth than the 25.8% posted in the first quarter. With oil at $135 or so, and Natural Gas over $13, the 20.0% rise in total net income for the sector is seems very conservative, and points to the amount of escalation on the cost side of the equation for the Energy firms. Yes, the price of oil is going up, but so too is the price of the steel pipe they put in the ground when they drill a well. While overall, there is a significant tendency for analysts to be too conservative in their earnings estimates, I suspect that Energy will be the place with the most potential for large positive surprises.
"
2074,AIG,"Tech looks like a strong runner up in an otherwise weak field, with growth of 10.8% expected.
"
2075,AIG,"Beyond that, growth does not look very inspiring. Staples looks like it will capture the bronze with growth of only 6.3%. Five sectors are expected to post lower total net income in this years second quarter than they did a year ago.

"
2077,AIG,"To help gauge the direction of the market, we take note of what analysts are thinking. By tallying their EPS changes, we can determine our revisions ratio. This ratio simply divides the total number of positive estimate revisions by the total number of estimate cuts. Thus, a high ratio is a bullish indicator and a low ratio is bearish. For the S&P 500 as a whole, a number below 0.80 or above 1.25 is generally significant. For individual sectors the distance from 1.0 should be greater for the numbers to be significant.
"
2078,AIG,"The revisions ratio for 2008 fell yet again. It has now fallen in six of the last seven weeks. It is now at 0.65, a reading that is negative, down from 0.80 last week, and 0.84 two weeks ago. The overall pace of estimate revisions is starting its seasonal rise. Over the last four weeks there have been 1,467 changes in estimates: 576 up and 891 down, up 7.5% from 1,365: 606 up and 759 down last week. Over the next four or five weeks the total number of revisions will most likely double from current levels. The ratio of firms with rising mean estimates to falling mean estimates is 0.76, slightly stronger than the revisions ratio, but also in negative territory. Two sectors are in positive territory, one in neutral and seven in negative territory.
"
2079,AIG,"Energy was far and away the strongest with almost four increases for every cut. While estimate increases were widespread in the sector, firms worth highlighting would include Noble Energy (NBL  -  Free Report), Occidental Petroleum (OXY) and Hess (HES). From a total economic impact point of view, significant increases were also seen for all of the big three, Exxon, Chevron (CVX  -  Free Report) and Conoco (COP  -  Free Report).
"
2080,AIG,"Tech was the only other sector in positive territory, but it is well below where it has been in recent weeks. Telecom was very weak this week, but that was on a very small number of total revisions.
"
2081,AIG,"The Financials were once again very weak, with over four cuts per increase, although the pace of estimate cuts is less than we have generally seen in recent months. Some of the largest and most significant Financial companies had some of the largest cuts, including American International Group (AIG  -  Free Report), Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) and Merrill Lynch (MER).

"
2083,AIG,"The 2009 revisions story is similar to the 2008 story, just slightly weaker. The revisions ratio also continued its decline, and is now solidly in negative territory. It fell to, 0.61, from 0.76 last week, and 0.82 two weeks ago. We still consider that to be in neutral territory.
"
2084,AIG,"Virtually all the strength is in the Energy sector, with a revisions ratio of 4.08. Tech also put in a decent showing at 1.43, but that is down from 2.38 last week. The Energy sector accounted for almost one third off all estimate increases over the last four weeks, and less than five percent of the estimate cuts.
"
2085,AIG,"If Energy were excluded, the revisions ratio would fall to 0.44. 16 of the 37 firms in the Energy sector have seen their 2009 earnings estimate increase by double digits over the last four weeks alone, including all of the big three (XOM, CVX and COP).
"
2086,AIG,"The revisions picture for the Financial sector is even worse for 2009 than it is for 2008, coming in at 0.15, or almost seven cuts for every increase. Revisions like these will eat away at the robust earnings rebound seen for 2009 (unless 2008 gets cut faster). We do not seem to be getting out of the woods on the Financial sector front. While there is weakness throughout the sector, one of the worst areas seems to be Banks with big exposure to Ohio, such as Key (KEY  -  Free Report), Fifth Third (FITB  -  Free Report), Huntington (HBAN  -  Free Report) and National City (NCC).
"
2087,AIG,"The total number of revisions for the whole S&P 500 for 2009 is also well past its seasonal low point, and starting up out of the valley. There were a total of 1,280 revisions: 487 up and 793 down. This is up 3.7% from 1,234 (534 up and 700 down) last week. As second quarter earnings start rolling in, expect the pace of revisions activity to pick up significantly. The ratio of firms with rising mean estimates to falling mean estimates is 0.63, in line with the revisions ratio, and also in negative territory.

"
2089,AIG,"When making investment decisions, growth should always be looked at in conjunction with how much you are paying for a stock. Thus, it makes sense to look at the total earnings expected for a sector, relative to that sectors total market capitalization. This is basically a variation on looking at the P/E.
"
2090,AIG,"The chart below shows the share of total earnings for 2007, 2008 and 2009, as well as the share of total market capitalization for each sector (the final bar shown). Since the S&P 500 is a market cap weighted index, this is the same as its index weight. On the chart below, the difference between the sizes of the first three bars shows if a sector is gaining or losing ""earnings share"". The difference between the final bar and the first three bars shows if the sector is selling for an above or below market P/E. If the final bar is smaller than the other bars, the sector is selling for a below market P/E. However, as opposed to just showing the sector P/Es, it also shows the relative importance of the sectors to the overall index.
"
2091,AIG,"For years, the Financials were the dominate force in the market, both in terms of market cap, and even more so in terms of total earnings. They have now been decisively dethroned on both counts. On the Market cap front it just slipped to third place behind Energy. While still in second place based on 2008 earnings, it seems likely that they will lose that slot as well. Still, despite their current problems, the Financials are still a very significant influence on the market. They will lose the earnings crown this year to the Energy sector.
"
2092,AIG,"Even with all the disasters in the sector, for 2007, the Financials accounted for 22.1% of the total net income for the S&P 500. In 2008, that is currently expected to decline to 14.1% before rebounding to 18.9% in 2009. However, in recent years the sector has accounted for well over a quarter of all earnings.
"
2093,AIG,"Energy has usurped the crown this year, with its earnings share climbing to 20.8% from 15.6% in 2007. This week Energy surpassed Financials for the 2009 earnings crown as well, and is now expected to get 19.1% of all S&P 500 earnings in 2009.
"
2094,AIG,"On the market cap (and index weight) front, Tech overtook the Financials a two months ago and currently stands at 16.9%. Energy has moved into second place when it comes to index weight at 15.0%. The Financials have plunged to 13.6% of the index. As recently as the end of February, Financials had a 17.2% index weighting versus 15.7% for Tech and just 13.0% for Energy. Most analysts are using very conservative pricing assumptions in their forecasts for the Energy sector (relative to that implied in the futures market), so earnings estimates still have lots of room to rise.
"
2095,AIG,"Keep in mind that these numbers are snapshots, when you should be thinking about a movie. At the end of February (the first time we had a complete read on 2009), the Financials were expected to gather 22.1% of all earnings for 2008, and Energy was expected to only get 16.0%. For 2009, the expected earnings shares were 15.0% for Energy and 22.4% for Financials. In general it seems as if the Energy sector is consistently gaining 0.2% of share for each year every week, with a similar decline for the Financials. If those trends continue, then Energy could be as dominate on the earnings front in 2008 as the Financials were in 2007, and the Financials could slip into third place in total earnings behind Tech.
"
2096,AIG,"For many years Financials were clearly the dominate factor in the overall market, despite generally selling for below market P/Es. Based on 2008 earnings, the Financials have a P/E of 13.3x and based on 2009, only 8.3x. However given the pace of estimate cuts in the sector, the true P/E is probably higher since the actual earnings will be significantly lower.
"
2097,AIG,"Energy has just taken the throne as the cheapest based on 2008 earnings trading at 10.0x, and 9.1x based on 2009 expectations. The Tech sector is far and away the most expensive in the market, trading for 17.1x 2008 and 14.5x 2009 expectations.
"
2098,AIG,"Keep your eyes on the revisions. Unless the spreading of economic weakness to the rest of the world causes oil prices to plunge (and the recent trends are very much in the other direction), you can have much more confidence in Energy earnings forecasts actually being achieved (or exceeded) than is true with the Financials.
"
2099,AIG,"The S&P 500 as a whole is trading for 13.9x and 11.5x, 2008 and 2009 earnings, respectively. Based on a blend of 50% 2008 earnings and 50% 2009 earnings; that translates to a 7.87% earnings yield, which looks extremely cheap relative to a 3.95% ten year T-note. Even against the A corporate bond yield of 6.11% it looks attractive. However, the current level of expectations for corporate earnings still implies that profits will stay well above their historical averages as a share of GDP. That would be an exceedingly rare occurrence during a recession. The comparison between the earnings yield on the S&P and the 10 year T-note is in my opinion more a reflection of the extreme unattractiveness of long term T-notes at this point than stocks looking particularly cheap in general, however there are attractive stocks out there. It appears that the flight to quality has caused a massive bubble in the price of T-notes. This is far and away, in my opinion, the most significant bubble in the market today, not the price of oil. The prices are hard to justify given the risk that the massive injections of liquidity by the Fed to ameliorate the credit crunch will end up fueling the fires of inflation.
"
2100,AIG,"Neil Malkin contributed significantly to this report.
"
2101,AIG,"Data in this report, unless stated otherwise, is through the close on Thursday 7/10/2008
"
2102,AIG,"For all of the bad news released over the past five days, the markets have not really moved much. Despite the liquidity rumors circulating Lehman (LEH), the continued increase in foreclosures, threats by the airlines to start charging for seatbelts, the Paul Pierce-like comeback staged by oil and the sudden jump in the unemployment rate, the S&P 500 is down only about 1.5% for the week.
"
2103,AIG,"Why?
"
2104,AIG,"The rally on Thursday helped quite a bit, though there was really no good reason for it. Yes, the retail sales numbers from the likes of Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report) did signal that consumers are spending their stimulus checks, but there was a reasonable expectation for upside in the May data. Verizon Wireless' takeover of Alltel was interesting, but not the type of thing that drives the broad markets higher on strong volume.
"
2105,AIG,"Rather, the reason seems to be that many traders are betting on a second-half recovery. While more bad news may come out, there is an assumption that things are going to start getting noticeably better. And the May sales data was just good enough to reinforce this sentiment.
"
2106,AIG,"Though, I remain hopeful that we will see a recovery, I'm also pragmatic. The problems in the financial and housing sectors are not going away anytime soon. The airlines need to consolidate and it is questionable as to whether they will ever come up with a model that will truly allow them to maintain profitability and financial stability. On the other hand, the global economy is growing, a large variety of companies are making money and the overwhelming majority of Americans are both employed and current on their mortgage payments.
"
2107,AIG,"The key for investors is to stay focused on the long-term. Use prudence, keep looking for stocks trading at reasonable valuations with rising earnings estimates and don't try to read much into the day-to-day swings in the markets. This is what we are doing with the Focus List.
"
2108,AIG,"Financials Back In The Spotlight
"
2109,AIG,"Financial stocks were back in the spotlight this week, again for all the wrong reasons.
"
2110,AIG,"The Wall Street Journal suggested that Lehman Brothers (LEH) could soon sell $4 billion of new stock to provide an influx of capital. Reuters reported that the cost of credit default swaps has tightened. I don't follow Lehman closely enough to say if the current speculation about the firm's potential lack of adequate liquidity is justified, but I can say that the covering brokerage analysts are bracing themselves for an awful second-quarter earnings reports.
"
2111,AIG,"During the past 30 days, the consensus earnings estimate has plunged to four cents per share from $1.07. More significantly, earnings estimates for fiscal 2009 continue to be slashed.
"
2112,AIG,"The downward revisions are not solely limited to LEH, either. Full-year 2008 and 2009 forecasts are being cut on many firms within the sector, including American International Group (AIG  -  Free Report), Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report), Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report), MBIA  and XL Capital (XL  -  Free Report).
"
2113,AIG,"This is why I have been keeping financial stocks out of the Focus List.
"
2114,AIG,"Commodities Are Still A Wildcard
"
2115,AIG,"Oil's $12 jump between Thursday and Friday caught most people by surprise. The move was sparked by threats from ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet about raising interest rates next week. Trichet's comments sent the dollar plunging.
"
2116,AIG,"Bloomberg News reported this morning that Morgan Stanley analyst Ole Slorer predicted today that crude could hit ""$150 within a month"". Though an interesting prediction, the reality is that just about everyone has been unable to predict where oil is headed over the short-term. We're seeing this with the constant positive earnings estimate revisions to companies involved in the upstream side of the energy sector and the constant downward revisions made to the refiners.
"
2117,AIG,"Even Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke is a bit perplexed. He recently stated that the possibility of the commodities rally lasting longer than expected remains an ""important risk to the inflation forecast"".
"
2118,AIG,"At some point, shorting oil is going to be a great trade; however, nobody has a crystal ball that is good enough to when this will be.
"
2119,AIG,"As far as gasoline, the AAA calculates that gasoline prices are at a new record of $3.989 a gallon. Make sure your tires are properly inflated and observe the speed limit.
"
2120,AIG,"Focus List Changes
"
2121,AIG,"There were no changes to the Focus List this week.
"
2122,AIG,"Charles Rotblut, CFA is the Senior Market Analyst for Zacks.com. He can be reached at crotblut@zacks.com.
"
2123,AIG,"Last week, I expressed optimism about the economy and the equity markets. I also said, however, that we were not yet out of the woods.
"
2124,AIG,"The news over the past few days reinforced my view about being cautiously optimistic.
"
2125,AIG,"There continues to be good earnings from companies with exposure to economic fluctuations, such as Walt Disney (DIS) and Focus List member Priceline.com (PCLN). Productivity was better than expected in the first-quarter. Many retailers reported growth in April sales. More Americans received their stimulus checks. Finally, the aggregate trend in estimate revisions continues to suggest a declining level of pessimism on the part of brokerage analysts.
"
2126,AIG,"On the other hand, oil continued to hit new highs. American International Group (AIG  -  Free Report) reminded investors that the credit crunch is hurting earnings. Eduardo Castro-Wright, who oversees Wal-Mart's (WMT  -  Free Report) U.S. stores, observed that ""the 'paycheck cycle' is more pronounced for customers than in past months.""
"
2127,AIG,"Wal-Mart's conference call on Tuesday could be interesting from a standpoint of how stimulus checks are being spent. Although it is still early, WMT could provide insight as to whether consumers are using the money to buy necessities (food, medicine, etc.), if choosing to splurge on discretionary items like flat panel televisions or saving it/paying down debt.
"
2128,AIG,"Keep in mind that revolving consumer debt rose at a 7.9% annual rate in March, according to the Federal Reserve. Soaring gasoline prices and rising food prices are squeezing many consumers. Falling home prices make it harder to depend on home equity lines. For some people, the rebate checks will provide a much needed infusion of cash. But, even among those who need the cash, there is no guarantee that they will make the most fiscally responsible decision on what to do with the stimulus.
"
2129,AIG,"From an economic standpoint, we want the rebate checks to be spent. More money tossed into the economy should help to accelerate growth. Saving the cash or using it to pay down debt would be the smarter move for many people, however. Predicting what consumers will actually do is very difficult, especially given that previous surveys have given conflicting forecasts.
"
2130,AIG,"Going back to the bigger picture, outside of the financial, homebuilding and retail sector, most corporations are continuing to realize growth. The economy did expand in the first-quarter and we expect the pace of growth to accelerate. It may not be the perfect environment, but there are signs that we should begin to see a gradual recovery.
"
2131,AIG,"The major indexes tested their 200-day moving averages, but pulled back. Blame Texas Tea for the failure to move higher.
"
2132,AIG,"I would caution against reading too much into the action of the past few days. Earnings season is coming to an end and the Fed is on hold, which means fewer catalysts over the short-term. I think a lot people are waiting to see if the recovery does kick in.
"
2133,AIG,"Plus, there the risk remains that the recent upward move was nothing more than a bear trap. I think it was signaled the start of a recovery, but in order to be pragmatic, I need to acknowledge both the good and the bad.
"
2134,AIG,"Focus List Updates
"
2135,AIG,"We added four stocks to the portfolio, the most within the span of seven days in quite some time. First-quarter earnings resulted in some new stocks showing up on our screens.
"
2136,AIG,"Central European Distributors (CEDC) is a Polish company that produces vodka. The company gives us exposure to Eastern Europe. We also liked its valuation and the fact that it raised guidance.
"
2137,AIG,"Fomento Economico Mexicano (FMX  -  Free Report) owns a stake in Mexican bottler Coca-Cola FEMSA (KOF) and operates a chain of convenience stores in Mexico. This was a good way to give us additional international exposure at an attractive valuation.
"
2138,AIG,"Parker Hannifin (PH  -  Free Report) makes fluid control products. We wanted to add another stock in the broad industrial products sector and PH has the best combination of projected growth, rising estimates and valuation.
"
2139,AIG,"Psychiatric Solutions (PSYS) was one of several hospitals to report good first-quarter numbers. As the name implies, PSYS focuses on providing mental health services. The company has been growing by acquisition, but also realized same-facility growth, a positive sign.
"
2140,AIG,"Charles Rotblut, CFA is the Senior Market Analyst for Zacks.com. He can be reached at crotblut@zacks.com.
"
2141,AIG,"Dow components American International Group (AIG  -  Free Report) and Walt Disney (DIS  -  Free Report) are among the more than 770 companies on the weekly earnings calendar. Although the number of companies confirmed to report remains high, the mix will include a far greater proportion of mid and small-cap companies.
"
2142,AIG,"There will be a total of 53 S&P 500 member companies releasing quarterly results. In addition to AIG and DIS, the most watched report is likely to be Cisco Systems (CSCO  -  Free Report), on Tuesday afternoon.
"
2143,AIG,"Given that the Fed is on hold until at least August, economic data should have a big impact on daily market direction as long as it does not point to accelerating inflation or a severely worsening economy. Key data on the calendar includes:
"
2144,AIG,"Monday: ISM April services index
"
2145,AIG,"Wednesday: Preliminary first-quarter productivity, March pending home sales, March consumer credit
"
2146,AIG,"Thursday: March wholesale inventories, weekly initial jobless claims
"
2147,AIG,"Friday: March trade balance
"
2148,AIG,"The recent break above resistance levels by the major indexes is bullish sign. None of the scheduled events should derail the recent momentum, thereby allowing stocks to move higher. The amount of upside is a matter of question because of the ongoing economic slump and the impact oil and the dollar will have on daily market activity. Still, I am feeling more bullish.
"
2149,AIG,"First-Quarter Earnings
"
2150,AIG,"Three-quarters of the S&P 500 reported first-quarter earnings as of Thursday evening. The aggregate numbers are not significantly different from the first quarter, but are down from last year.
"
2151,AIG,"Positive surprises are outnumbering negative surprises by a margin of 2.42. Decent, but a definitive decline from the ratio of 3.38 we saw at the same point a year ago.
"
2152,AIG,"Average first-quarter earnings per share are down 14.4% on a year-over-year basis. Using median per share numbers, however, results in 9.5% growth. The differential reflects the impact of the losses incurred by the likes of Centex (CTX), KB Home (KBH), Ambac Financial (ABK), Washington Mutual (WM) and their peers.
"
2153,AIG,"The same differential exists with net income, the average change is -16.2% and the median change is +5.3%,
"
2154,AIG,"Companies That Could Issue Positive Earnings Surprises during the Week of May 5 - May 9Walt Disney (DIS  -  Free Report) has traded upward following positive earnings surprises before, and the entertainment conglomerate did exceed fourth-quarter expectations by a margin of 11 cents. Earnings estimates are unchanged ahead of Disney's first-quarter report at 50 cents per share, but five of the 19 brokerage analysts have raised their forecasts within the past 30 days. The most accurate estimate is pointing to a slight surprise at 51 cents. Walt Disney is scheduled to report on Tuesday, May 6, after the close of trading.
"
2155,AIG,"For a second consecutive week, energy companies are the most likely to top expectations. Here are a few that should surprise to the upside:
"
2156,AIG,"Cimarex Energy (XEC  -  Free Report) realized an 8% increase in oil and gas production during the first quarter. Oil production was particularly strong thanks to new horizontal wells in New Mexico and Texas. Four brokerage analysts have raised their forecasts over the past few weeks, pushing the first-quarter consensus earnings estimate up 15 cents to $1.50 per share. The most accurate estimate is more bullish at $1.58 per share. XEC has reported three consecutive positive earnings surprises. Cimarex Energy is scheduled to report on Tuesday, May 6, before the start of trading.
"
2157,AIG,"Several brokerage analysts have raised their projections on Devon Energy (DVN  -  Free Report) recently. The first-quarter consensus earnings estimate of $2.27 is 18 cents higher than the average forecast of 30 days ago. The most accurate estimate is even more bullish at $2.29 per share. DVN has announced a positive earnings surprise three out of the last four quarters.
"
2158,AIG,"Forest Oil (FST) has issued four consecutive positive earnings surprises and the trend in earnings estimates revisions suggests a fifth could be forthcoming. Within the past few weeks, eight brokerage analysts have upped their first-quarter forecasts. The consensus earnings estimate of 90 cents per share is now seven cents higher than the average projection of a month ago. Forest Oil is scheduled to report on Tuesday, May 6, before the start of trading.
"
2159,AIG,"Companies That Could Issue Negative Earnings Surprises during the Week of May 5 - May 9
"
2160,AIG,"The continued fallout from the subprime collapse has brokerage analysts expecting a loss from American International Group (AIG  -  Free Report). The average forecast for a first-quarter loss of 30 cents per share represents a sharp reversal from two months ago when analysts had been predicting a profit of 61 cents per share. AIG missed earnings estimates by a wide margin for two consecutive quarters. American International Group is scheduled to report on Thursday, May 8, after the close of trading.

"
2166,AIG,"The books on the fourth-quarter earnings season are just about closed with 95% of the S&P 500 firms having reported (474 companies). It seems clear that it is a mixed bag at best.
"
2167,AIG,"On a median EPS growth rate basis, growth of 8.1% is a little bit shy of the double-digit pace that we have come to expect. It is not an awful result, especially given the current fears about the economy.
"
2168,AIG,"On a total net income basis, however, this is the weakest season we have seen since the end of the last recession. In recent years, the normal ratio of positive surprises to disappointments has run about 3.0:1. This time around it is just 2.3:1.
"
2169,AIG,"The median surprise tells a similar story, currently running at 2.8%, while over the last four years it ended up at 3.0% or better. Thus, on a median growth and surprise basis, this is a pretty normal quarter, just a bit softer than usual.
"
2170,AIG,"The bad news has been very concentrated in the Financial sector. The Financials have been responsible for almost 40% of all the earnings disappointments. It is the only sector with more disappointments than positive surprises.
"
2171,AIG,"The Consumer Discretionary sector has also been weak, joining the Financials in negative territory for median year-over-year EPS growth. It has a surprise ratio of 2.1:1 and a 2.5% median surprise.
"
2172,AIG,"While EPS were down in those sectors, the Energy sector posted extremely robust growth of 24.6%, even if it didnt shoot the lights out on the surprise front (1.7:1 surprise ratio and 3.2% median surprise). Tech, Industrials and Health Care also posted double-digit growth and all had surprise ratios of 5.0:1 or better and solid median surprises.
"
2173,AIG,"Looking forward to the first quarter, all of those sectors are currently expected to post double-digit gains again. The weak sisters (Financials, Discretionary and Materials) in the fourth quarter are expected to continue to be weak in the first quarter.

"
2175,AIG,"The median year-over-year growth discussed above is the good news, things look far worse on a total net income basis. On a total net income basis, the fourth quarter can be summed up in a single word: UGLY.  It still is by far the weakest quarter we have seen in a long, long time.
"
2176,AIG,"Total net income reported so far is 17.2% below year ago levels, although that is better than the 18.1% decline we were seeing last week, and the 20.1% decline two weeks ago. On a median basis, the reporting firms are showing positive growth in earnings, just less positive than in previous quarters, on a total net income basis, earnings are plunging.
"
2177,AIG,"Looking at all 474 firms that have reported, collectively they posted profits of $164.3 billion this quarter, down from the $198.6 billion they reported a year ago. However it very much looks like a tale of two markets, with Tech, Telecom and Energy doing well (up over 20%) and Financials doing awful.  Collectively, the 89 Financial firms that have reported so far are in the have earned only $1.2 billion, a year ago those same firms earned $55.1 billion. Noteworthy firms in the red include Countrywide Financial (CFC), SLM Corp (SLM  -  Free Report), Washington Mutual (WM), and perhaps most troubling of all Ambac (ABK) and MBIA . We would also note that the cut off for this report came before the results for American International (AIG  -  Free Report) and Freddie Mac (FRE) were reported, so the total will be worse than shown. These numbers do not include non-recurring items, although parsing out when loan losses are non-recurring in the Financials is problematic at times. Throw in the non-recurring items makes the total losses reported, much higher.
"
2178,AIG,"Telecom is leading the pack, with growth of 32.2% but that is artificially boosted by the AT&T/Bell South merger a year ago.
"
2179,AIG,"Tech is up 26.7%. It certainly appears that Tech is one of the bright spots for the quarter. Energy posted total net income growth of 23.2%. Oil over $90 is generally pretty good for energy profits, and with prices over $100, the good times for the sector should continue in the first quarter. Health Care is also having a very good earnings season with 17.6% total net income growth.

"
2181,AIG,"To help gauge the direction of the market, we take note of what analysts are thinking. By tallying their EPS changes, we can determine our revisions ratio. This ratio simply divides the total number of positive estimate revisions by the total number of estimate cuts. Thus, a high ratio is a bullish indicator and a low ratio is bearish. For the S&P 500 as a whole, a number below 0.80 or above 1.25 is generally significant. For individual sectors the distance from 1.0 should be greater for the numbers to be significant.
"
2182,AIG,"The revisions ratio is edging up, but is still deep in negative territory. Given the very strong surprise numbers (outside of Finance), one would normally expect strong revisions ratios. This, so far is looking like the story of the dog that didnt bark. The normal reaction by analysts to a positive earnings surprise is to raise estimates for future periods. This does not seem to be happening this time.  While there has been some upward drift to the revisions ratio, it is not very convincing as we approach the peak of total revisions for the quarter.
"
2183,AIG,"The revisions ratio for 2008 is 0.64, indicating about three estimate cuts for every two increases, this is up flat with last week, and up slightly from 0.57 two weeks ago.
"
2184,AIG,"The total number of revisions is past its peak. Over the last four weeks there have been 2,701 changes in estimates, (1,059 up and 1,642 down), down 12.5% from last weeks 3,088 (1202 up and 1,886 down).
"
2185,AIG,"By far the sector that is faring the worst is the Financials where cuts out number increases by 4:1. The sector has been the worst in terms of estimate revisions for three straight months now. Banks continue to get slammed, with double-digit numbers of estimate cuts. However, now we are seeing the weakness spread to the insurance companies as well, with large numbers of cuts for firms like Allstate (ALL  -  Free Report), Lincoln National (LNC  -  Free Report) and Prudential (PRU  -  Free Report). Given the disappointments at the GSEs and AIG, look for many estimate cuts from them next week.
"
2186,AIG,"Consumer Discretionary follows with a revisions ratio of 0.37, or almost three cuts per every increase. While still very weak, it is an improvement over the more than four to one pace of two weeks ago. Industrials have joined Health Care and Utilities in positive territory. However, only Utilities is better than 3:2 increases over cuts.  Overall the revisions picture, while not as dire as it was a month ago is still downbeat. The ratio of firms up to firms down was moderately weaker than the revisions ratio at 0.60.

"
2188,AIG,"The 2009 revisions show that analysts are already revising their estimates downward on balance for the year. While stronger than 2008, the revisions ratio of 2009 is still very much in negative territory at 0.70, a tick down from last weeks 0.71.
"
2189,AIG,"Industrials, Materials and Health Care are the only three sectors to enjoy more increases than cuts. The pictures for the Financials and Consumer Discretionary sectors continue to look bleak. In particular, the retailers are taking it on the chin (keep in mind that these firms generally have non-December fiscal years, so the end of FY2 is much closer for them than for most firms). However, the total number of revisions for the whole S&P 500 for 2009 is still relatively light, and like 2008, are past their peak for the quarter. There were a total of 1,310 revisions: 540 up and 770 down. This is down 9.5% from 1,447 (600 up and 847 down) last week.

2191,AIG,"When making investment decisions, growth should always be looked at in conjunction with how much you are paying for a stock. Thus, it makes sense to look at the total earnings expected for a sector, relative to that sectors total market capitalization. This is basically a variation on looking at the P/E.
"
2192,AIG,"The chart below shows the share of total earnings for 2007, 2008 and 2009, as well as the share of total market capitalization for each sector (the final bar shown). Since the S&P 500 is a market cap weighted index, this is the same as its index weight. On the chart below, the difference between the sizes of the first three bars shows if a sector is gaining or losing ""earnings share"". The difference between the final bar and the first three bars shows if the sector is selling for an above or below market P/E. If the final bar is smaller than the other bars, the sector is selling for a below market P/E. However, as opposed to just showing the sector P/Es, it also shows the relative importance of the sectors to the overall index.
"
2193,AIG,"Despite their current problems, the Financials are still a very significant influence on the market, accounting for a much larger slice of the earnings in each year than any other sector. Even with all the disasters in the sector, for 2007, the Financials will account for 22.0% of the total net income for the S&P 500, and 22.1% in 2008. However, in recent years the sector has accounted for well over a quarter of all earnings. Thus even though the sector is the cheapest on a P/E basis, it just reclaimed it throne as the biggest total market cap sector. The Financial sector makes up 17.2% of the total market capitalization of the index, followed by Tech at 15.6%. Given the ongoing massive cuts in estimates, please take the P/E on the Financials with a bag of rock salt. The true earnings are likely to be far lower than current estimates now suggest.
"
2194,AIG,"For many years Financials were clearly the dominate factor in the overall market. Based on 2008 earnings, the Financials have a P/E of only 11.0x and based on 2009, only 9.6x. However given the pace of estimate cuts in the sector, the true P/E is probably higher since the actual earnings will be significantly lower.
"
2195,AIG,"Energy is also very cheap based on 2008 earnings, trading at 11.5x, and 10.8x based on 2009 expectations. Unless the spreading of economic weakness to the rest of the world causes oil prices to plunge (and the recent trends are very much in the other direction), you can have much more confidence in Energy earnings forecasts actually being achieved than is true with the Financials. While Energy accounts for only 13.0% of the total market cap of the S&P 500, it is responsible for 15.8% of 2007 earnings and is expected to be the source of 16.0% of 2008 earnings (falling to 15.0% in 2009). This is almost a mirror image of Tech which has a 15.7% weight in the index but was responsible for only 11.7% of 2007 earnings. However, Techs earnings share is expected to rise to 12.5% in 2008 and 13.0% in 2009.
"
2196,AIG,"The S&P 500 as a whole is trading for 14.2x and 12.5x, 2008 and 2009 earnings, respectively. Based on 2008 earnings that translates to a 7.05% earnings yield, which looks extremely cheap relative to a 3.56% ten year T-note. Even against the A-rated corporate bond yield of 5.69% it looks attractive. However, the current level of expectations for corporate earnings still imply that profits will stay well above their historical averages as a share of GDP. That would be an exceedingly rare occurrence during a recession.

"
2198,AIG,"Data in this report, unless stated otherwise, is through the close on Thursday, Feb 28.
"
2199,AIG,"It's a Leap Year week with Friday being Feb 29. Given the relative historic infrequency of Feb 29 corresponding with a trading day, any market statistics for the extra day need to be taken with a grain of salt.
"
2200,AIG,"Five big reports will help bring fourth-quarter earnings closer to an end. Dow components American International Group (AIG  -  Free Report) and Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report) will be joined this week by Dell (DELL), Lowe's (LOW  -  Free Report) and Target (TGT  -  Free Report). Overall, 514 companies have been confirmed to report, including 49 members of the S&P 500. Retailers will account for approximately 10% of all earnings releases.
"
2201,AIG,"In addition to profit news, market participants will be listening to Ben Bernanke. The Fed Chairman will deliver his semiannual testimony, formerly known as Humphrey-Hawkins, to the Congress on Wednesday and Thursday. I don't expect the Chairman to say anything new or unexpected, but it is anybody's guess how the markets will react to the speech. Fed fund futures continue to price in a 50-basis point cut at the late-March meeting.
"
2202,AIG,"The week's economic schedule includes:
"
2203,AIG,"Monday - January existing home sales
"
2204,AIG,"Tuesday - January PPI, February Conference Board consumer confidence survey
"
2205,AIG,"Wednesday - January durable goods orders, January new home sales
"
2206,AIG,"Thursday - Revised Q4 GDP
"
2207,AIG,"Friday - January personal income and spending, final University of Michigan February consumer confidence, February Chicago PMI
"
2208,AIG,"The mix of data and testimony could create some volatility, though the major equity indexes seem to have - at least temporarily - more or less flat lined. The VIX (VIX), a measure of volatility, has a trend of higher lows, which is a sign of rising fear. Keep in mind that there are also wildcards out there, particularly the ongoing credit crunch and the risk of a credit downgrade on one of the major bond insurers. On the flip side, a midweek rally could occur if Bernanke offers some assurance that the threat of stagflation is not as real as some of the recent economic data suggests.
"
2209,AIG,"Fourth-Quarter Earnings Results
"
2210,AIG,"Fourth-quarter earnings season is nearing an end. As of Thursday night, nearly 90% of the companies within the S&P 500 had reported.
"
2211,AIG,"Median per share growth is 10.5%, but average per share growth is -14.6%. A total of 22 companies, mostly financial and homebuilders, posted triple-digit percentage declines in EPS. In contrast, just 12 managed to at least double their profits. Net income numbers show a similar difference: 7.7% median per share growth and -8.2% average per share growth.
"
2212,AIG,"Behind the numbers, two companies increased per share earnings for every one that reported a decline. The index-weighted numbers for the S&P 500 don't look good because some of the biggest losers also have some of the biggest influence on the index. (This is especially the case with the mega-cap financials).
"
2213,AIG,"On the surprise front, 271 companies have surpassed expectations and 113 have missed, a ratio of 2.4:1. The remaining 52 companies matched expectations.
"
2214,AIG,"Companies That Could Issue Positive Earnings Surprises during the Week of Feb 25 - 29Gap Inc. (GPS  -  Free Report) experienced a 3% decline in fourth-quarter sales, with sales at its namesake chain falling 5%. Nonetheless, the company projects that per share earnings will come in between 33 and 35 cents. The guidance was above the previous consensus earnings estimate of 29 cents. As a result seven brokerage analysts upped their forecasts, sending the consensus to 34 cents per share. The most accurate consensus is slightly more bullish at 35 cents. The casual apparel retailer has topped expectations for eight consecutive quarters. Gap is scheduled to report on Thursday, Feb 28, after the close of trading.
"
2215,AIG,"Flowserve (FLS  -  Free Report) anticipates full-year 2007 revenues totaled $3.75 billion, slightly above its previous guidance. The industrial pump and valve maker also believes that its operating margin improved by about 300 basis points. Three of the five covering brokerage analysts are expecting some upside when the company reports. The consensus earnings estimate of $1.23 is nine cents higher than the average forecast of a month ago and reflects their revisions. The most accurate estimate is more bullish at $1.30 per share. FLS has delivered positive earnings surprises for three consecutive quarters. Flowserve is scheduled to report on Wednesday, Feb 27, after the close of trading.
"
2216,AIG,"Companies That Could Issue Negative Earnings Surprises during the Week of Feb 25 - 29
"
2217,AIG,"Fears about bad debt write-downs have caused four brokerage analysts to cut their fourth-quarter forecasts on American International Group (AIG  -  Free Report) within the past few weeks. One of the primary concerns is a SEC filing showing a potential $5 billion loss at some of the insurer's subsidiaries. AIG has stated that the losses will not be ""material"", but clearly some analysts are concerned. The fourth-quarter consensus earnings estimate of $1.06 is 34 cents below the average forecast of a month ago. The most accurate estimate is far more bearish at 23 cents per share. AIG has missed expectations twice during the past four quarters. American International Group is scheduled to report on Thursday, Feb 28, after the close of trading.
"
2218,AIG,"The fourth-quarter consensus earnings estimate for Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report) continues to fall. Within the past seven days, two brokerage analysts have lowered their forecasts on the home improvement retailer, bringing the total number of downward revisions within the past month to six. The current consensus estimate of 44 cents per share is three cents below the average forecast of a month ago. The most accurate consensus is more bearish at 43 cents per share. HD has missed twice during the past four quarters. Home Depot is scheduled to report on Tuesday, Feb 26, before the start of trading.

2224,AIG,"Aerospace continues to be the best ranked sector.
"
2225,AIG,"Most of the Zacks #1 Rank (""strong buy"") and Zacks #2 Rank (""buy"") stocks within this sector derive a significant amount of their revenues from government spending. Two ongoing wars and a sustained focus on homeland security are providing a boost to revenues and earnings for aerospace and defense companies.
"
2226,AIG,"Although companies like Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report) and Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report) are very dependent on defense spending, there are companies within this group that also do a large amount of commercial business, such as FLIR Systems (FLIR  -  Free Report).
"
2227,AIG,"FLIR designs and manufactures thermal imaging and infrared camera systems. The company's products are used both for surveillance and industrial applications, such as leak detection.
"
2228,AIG,"FLIR generated revenues of $242.6 billion in the fourth-quarter, an increase of 31%. (Approximately 47% of sales came from the company's Government Systems' division). Adjusted earnings totaled 30 cents per share, matching expectations.
"
2229,AIG,"The company expects the favorable conditions to continue and guided for 2008 earnings between $1.13 and $1.20 per share. Nearly all of the covering brokerage analysts raised their forecast in response, sending the consensus earnings estimate seven cents higher to $1.18 per share.
"
2230,AIG,"FLIR is a Zacks #1 Rank stock and is classified in Electronics-Military Systems. LMT and NOC are Zacks #2 Rank stocks and are classified in Aerospace/Defense.
"
2231,AIG,"Shares of American International Group (AIG  -  Free Report) plunged to a five-year low on Tuesday because of subprime fears.
"
2232,AIG,"An SEC filing revealed that the company's model underestimated losses for its AIG Financial Products Corporation and AIG Trading Group subsidiaries (referred to collectively as AIGFP). The revised numbers showed a potential $5 billion loss in November, versus a previously disclosed $1.6 billion decline in valuation.
"
2233,AIG,"Yesterday, AIG responded by stating, ""Any losses AIGFP may realize over time as a result of meeting its obligations under these derivatives will not be material to AIG"".
"
2234,AIG,"So far, the fourth-quarter consensus estimate for AIG is largely unchanged in reaction to the new filing. The consensus earnings estimate calls for the insurance conglomerate to have earned $1.38 per share. This forecast is down two cents from a week ago. The most accurate estimate is more bearish at $1.37 per share. The company will likely report on Feb 28. AIG is a Zacks #3 Rank (""hold"") stock.
"
2235,AIG,"AIG is not the only insurer to be tied to the subprime crisis. Last week, Genworth Financial (GNW  -  Free Report), Lincoln National (LNC  -  Free Report) and Principal Financial Group (PFG  -  Free Report) all reported write-downs caused by the subprime crisis. GNW incurred a loss of $93 million, LNC wrote down $193 million and PFG realized a loss of at least $57 million. LNC is a Zacks #5 Rank (""strong sell"") stock and GNW and PFG are Zacks #4 Rank (""sell"") stocks.
"
2236,AIG,"So why are insurers being affected by subprime?
"
2237,AIG,"The answer requires an understanding of their business models. Insurers use actuarial models to determine what future claims may total. Based on these models, claims risk for each client is assessed and a premium is determined. (The higher the risk, the higher the premium.) These premiums are invested so that money paid in can grow over time.
"
2238,AIG,"In investing the premium payments, an insurer seeks to accomplish two goals. The first is to provide an extra source of income in addition to the premiums. The second is to ensure that an adequate balance of cash is available each year based on the expected level of claims. Therefore, insurers seek a combination of stocks (long-term growth) and bonds (short and mid-term income).
"
2239,AIG,"Given the size of their portfolios and the varied timing of claim payments, insurers need to diversify across various assets. Part of this diversification includes asset-backed securities, which typically pay a higher level of interest. While diversification does help returns over the long-term, the current environment and the structure of some subprime and ALT-A related securities is hurting the portfolios of multiple investors, including insurers.
"
2240,AIG,"I previously warned that insurers could be adversely affected by the subprime crisis and thus I'm not surprised to see some companies reporting declines in their investment income. I also think it is probable that the credit crunch will impact first-quarter earnings for these companies.
"
2241,AIG,"The trend in earnings estimate revisions supports my hypothesis. During the past four weeks, more estimates have been cut than raised on companies within Insurance-Life, Insurance-Multiline and Insurance-Property/Casualty.

"
2244,AIG,"The first week following the end of Daylight Savings Time (remember to set your clocks back on hour) should be relatively quiet and, given last Thursday's volatility, a bit of calm might just be good.
"
2245,AIG,"There are more than 650 companies confirmed to reported earnings, including just under 50 S&P 500 members, but many of these companies are not large or prominent enough to truly move the markets single-handedly. The two notable exceptions are Dow component American International Group (AIG  -  Free Report) and tech giant Cisco Systems (CSCO  -  Free Report).
"
2246,AIG,"The economic calendar is fairly light. The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) will publish its October service index on Monday. Wednesday brings third-quarter productivity, September wholesale trade and September consumer credit data. Weekly jobless claims will be published, as always, on Thursday. Friday will feature the preliminary University of Michigan's consumer confidence index, October import prices and the September trade balance. Given the combination of the Fed's hawkish statement, an unexpectedly strong third-quarter GDP and the October gain in nonfarm payrolls, none of the new reports should have any impact on renewing hopes for a December rate cut.
"
2247,AIG,"Third-Quarter Earnings Performance
"
2248,AIG,"As of Thursday evening, slightly less than 80% of the companies within the S&P 500 have reported third-quarter reports. Per share earnings growth for the median company within this large-cap index is running at 11.2%. Positive surprises are outnumbering negative surprises by a ratio of 2.7:1.
"
2249,AIG,"Expanding the universe to the S&P 1500 Composite (S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400 and S&P SmallCap 600), median growth is 10.3%. Positive surprises are outnumbering negative surprises by a margin of 2.1:1.
"
2250,AIG,"The lower proportion of financial companies reporting has clearly helped improved how third-quarter results look on an aggregate basis. During the first six weeks of earnings season, median per share profits growth among S&P 500 companies that reported was 7.4%. Banks and investment banks comprised 22% of this group. During the past two weeks, median per share earnings growth among S&P 500 companies that have reported has been running at 13%. Notably, banks and investment banks comprised just 1% of the latter group.
"
2251,AIG,"Companies That Could Issue Positive Earnings Surprises during the Week of Nov 5 - Nov 9Activision (ATVI  -  Free Report) recently released the latest sequel to its hit video game Guitar Hero to take advantage of the holiday shopping season. Although the launch came after the game maker's fiscal second quarter ended, brokerage analysts are still optimistic about how ATVI performed. Two out of the 14 covering analysts raised their quarterly projections, resulting in an one-cent improvement in the consensus estimate to a loss of two cents per share. The most accurate consensus is more bullish at breakeven results. ATVI has generated positive earnings surprises for two consecutive quarters. Activision is scheduled to report on Monday, Nov 5, after the close of trading.
"
2252,AIG,"The fiscal third-quarter consensus earnings estimate for Cisco Systems (CSCO  -  Free Report) rose by a penny, to 34 cents per share, during the past seven days as one covering brokerage analyst adjusted his forecast. The most accurate consensus is more bullish at 36 cents per share. The networking equipment company matched expectations last quarter, but topped estimates during each of the previous nine quarters. Cisco Systems is scheduled to report on Wednesday, Nov 7, after the close of trading.
"
2253,AIG,"TBS International (TBSI) will have the opportunity to allay recent worries about whether bulk shipping rates have hit a peak. Judging by the upward revisions in earnings estimate revisions for the third and fourth quarters as well as 2008, brokerage analysts continue to appear optimistic about the company's fundamentals. The consensus estimate is calling for third-quarter profits of 77 cents per share. This number could prove to be conservative given TBSI's streak of four consecutive positive surprises. TBS International is scheduled to report on Thursday, Nov 8, after the close of trading.
"
2254,AIG,"Companies That Could Issue Negative Earnings Surprises during the Week of Nov 5 - Nov 9
"
2255,AIG,"Refining margins have been causing earnings for several oil-related companies to be disappointing and Valero (VLO  -  Free Report) could be the next to miss. A few weeks ago, the company warned that per share third-quarter profits would be in the range of $1.30 to $1.40 per share. All of the covering brokerage analysts slashed their projections in response, causing the consensus estimate to plunge from $2.30 per share to $1.36 per share. Given that the refiner's second-quarter profits were 13 cents below expectations, it is possible that the covering analysts did not cut their forecasts enough. Valero is scheduled to report on Tuesday, Nov 6, before the start of trading.

"
2261,AIG,"A one-day Fed meeting will be held on Tuesday, Aug 7. The Federal Open Market Committee is not expected to change interest rates. It is unclear what, if anything, the Fed will change in its statement about housing or the economy. In its June statement, the Fed noted that the economy is expected to expand at a moderate pace and that there was an ongoing adjustment in the housing sector. Both of these observations continue to hold true, while the pace of inflation probably has not slowed enough to convince the Fed that rising prices are no longer a threat.
"
2262,AIG,"The Feds August meeting will be held during a week when the amount of economic data will be comparatively scarce and the pace of earnings news is slowing down. The first set of economic data will be published on Tuesday with preliminary second-quarter productivity data being released in the morning and June consumer credit being released in the afternoon. Wednesday features June wholesale trade numbers. July import price data will be released on Friday.
"
2263,AIG,"We have confirmed reports from 677 companies for the week of Aug 6-10. More importantly, the average size of the company reporting will be considerably smaller ($2.9 billion versus $6.1 billion for the week of Jul 30  Aug 3), meaning that the reports will have less of an impact on market direction. Dow component American International Group (AIG  -  Free Report) will report on Wednesday, Aug 8, after the close of trading. 
"
2264,AIG,"The markets, unfortunately, have not reacted to what is a good second-quarter earnings season. The reason is concern about problems within the credit markets, fueled by the ongoing implosion in subprime and Alt-A mortgage loans. The return of volatility could create buying opportunities, particularly when one considers that the median company in the S&P 500 has reported 12.9% EPS growth and the median company within the S&P 600 (S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400 and S&P SmallCap 600) has generated 9.4% growth. In addition, earnings estimates, on average, have been revised upwards. Profits for the S&P 500 are currently forecast to reach $94.06 this year, which is 1.1% better than what brokerage analysts were projecting a month ago.
"
2265,AIG,"From a trading standpoint, it is important to realize that August can be a volatile month. The number of earnings reports will decline throughout the month, many Americans will be out on summer vacations and hurricane season tends to start reaching its peak near the end of the month. Given the focus on the credit markets, it is likely that the equity markets will continue to experience choppy waters over the next several weeks.
"
2266,AIG,"Companies That Could Issue Positive Earnings Surprises during the Week of Aug 6 - 10Foster Wheeler (FWLT) has topped expectations by an average margin of 45 cents per share over the past four quarters. During the past month, one of the five covering brokerage analysts raised his forecast for second-quarter earnings, pushing the consensus estimate up by three cents to $1.33 per share. Foster Wheeler is scheduled to report on Wednesday, Aug 8, before the start of trading.
"
2267,AIG,"JA Solar Holdings (JASO  -  Free Report) completed its IPO last February and then proceeded to top expectations for its first reported quarter as a publicly-traded company. Ahead of the Chinese solar cell manufacturers second-quarter report, brokerage analysts have been revising their projections upward. The consensus estimate calls for profits of 20 cents per share, two cents above the average projection of a month ago. JA Solar is scheduled to report on Wednesday, Aug 8, before the start of trading.
"
2268,AIG,"A strong summer season for the travel industry has led one brokerage analyst to raise his second-quarter forecast on Priceline.com (PCLN). The revision caused the consensus estimate to rise by two cents to 80 cents per share. The Most Recent Consensus is more bullish at 90 cents per share. PCLN has topped expectations during each of the past four quarters by an average margin of 14 cents per share. Priceline.com is scheduled to report on Tuesday, Aug 7, after the close of trading.
"
2269,AIG,"A recent upward revision to TBS Internationals (TBSI) second-quarter consensus estimate suggests optimism about the shipping rates that the company was able to charge. During the past 30 days, one of the two covering brokerage analysts raised his forecast, sending the consensus estimate three cents higher to 55 cents per share. TBSI has topped expectations for three consecutive quarters by an average margin of 13.7 cents per share. TBS International is scheduled to report on Wednesday, Aug 8, before the start of trading.
"
2270,AIG,"Companies That Could Issue Negative Earnings Surprises during the Week of Aug 6 -10
"
2271,AIG,"Last month, Spectrum Brands (SPC) reduced its full-year revenue forecast to about $2.634 billion from its previous forecast of $2.648 billion. The company cited the adverse impact of dry weather conditions on its home and garden business and weaker-than-expected sales of batteries. The majority of the covering brokerage analysts cut their forecasts in responses, sending the consensus estimate down to a fiscal third-quarter loss of 10 cents per share. SPC has missed expectations three times during the past four quarters. Spectrum Brands is scheduled to report on Tuesday, Aug 7, before the start of trading.
