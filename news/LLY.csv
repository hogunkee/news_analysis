0,LLY,"AstraZeneca (AZN) and Eli Lilly (LLY) became the latest Tuesday in a series of pharmaceutical companies to scrap studies of a potential Alzheimer's disease treatment that appeared unlikely to work.The drugmakers discontinued Phase 3 studies of a drug called lanabecestat. An independent data monitoring committee predicted lanabecestat would miss its goals in studies in early Alzheimer's disease and in mild Alzheimer's dementia.""The complexity of Alzheimer's disease poses one of the most difficult medical challenges of our time,"" Lilly Research Labs President Daniel Skovronsky said in a written statement. ""We are grateful for the contributions of the study participants and their families.""Lanabecestat belongs to a class of drugs called BACE inhibitors, which work to prevent the buildup of a substance called beta amyloid plaque in the brain. Researchers believe the toxic substance is at the center of Alzheimer's disease.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAstraZeneca and Lilly are far from the only pharmaceutical companies frustrated in their pursuit of an Alzheimer's disease treatment. Dow Jones component Merck (MRK) ended studies of its drug, verubecestat, in mild-to-moderate and early Alzheimer's disease.Earlier this year, fellow Dow Jones stock Pfizer (PFE) abandoned its research into treatments for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. In May, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) stopped studies of its BACE inhibitor in patients with late-stage Alzheimer's disease on liver worries.In 2016, Lilly stock crashed after another drug missed its goals in a Phase 3 study. Lilly studied the drug, solanezumab, in patients with mild Alzheimer's disease.The market is increasingly looking to Biogen, which is working on a monoclonal antibody. Its drug, known as aducanumab, works to remove beta amyloid plaques in the brain. Analysts expect Biogen to have data for its key study in 2019 or 2020.Lilly said Tuesday it doesn't expect significant costs associated with its decision to end these studies of a potential Alzheimer's disease treatment. It reaffirmed its guidance for 2018 and its midterm guidance for the remainder of this decade.""We are committed to ensuring our findings can be used to inform further research in the Alzheimer's community, given the importance of finding a treatment for this disease,"" said AstraZeneca spokesperson Menelas Pangalos in a statement.On the stock market today, Lilly sank a fraction to close at 85.49. Shares are consolidating with a buy point at 89.19. AstraZeneca lost 0.6% to 36.16.

1,LLY,"Alder Biopharmaceuticals (ALDR) likely will seek a buyer after its Amgen (AMGN)-rivaling preventative migraine treatment gets approval, an analyst said Thursday as shares tanked on the hire of a new chief executive.Alder shares dropped 1.9% to 17.80 on the stock market today. Shares broke out of a cup base at an 18.70 buy point earlier in the week. But the rally was short-lived as the stock sank for three consecutive days.The biotech company hired Robert Azelby, former chief commercial officer at Juno Therapeutics, as its new chief executive. Celgene (CELG) recently acquired Juno, an immuno-oncology player. Before that, Azelby worked at Amgen where he managed the U.S. oncology business.But Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges sees Azelby's tenure as likely a short one.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""The advantages of Mr. Azelby, in our view, are locality and availability, since he was already in Seattle and had presumably become available after the acquisition of Juno by Celgene,"" he said in a report to clients.He added: ""It's hard to believe that the board views Mr. Azelby as the long-term leader for this company, and the appointment adds to our conviction that the board will ultimately support a sale.""A sale is unlikely however until Alder gets approval for its preventative migraine treatment, known as a CGRP inhibitor. Amgen gained approval for its drug, Aimovig, in May. Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) and Eli Lilly (LLY) are also working on similar drugs.Earlier this year, Alder's founder and former CEO Randall Schatzman unexpectedly stepped down. Alder had planned to submit its application for its migraine treatment in the second half of the year. Now, it expects to submit an application in the first quarter of 2019.The fact that Alder hired a new CEO isn't surprising, Porges said. ""But it is something of a surprise that the individual appointed to the position has no experience in neurology, and has not previously overseen the complex multi-functional elements of a product introduction,"" he said.RBC analyst Brian Abrahams, on the other hand, called the hire a ""sensible fit"" as Alder moves toward its commercial stage. Azelby brings significant experience in commercial strategy across large and small biotechs, and biopharma, he said.""We believe all of this will be important in launching (preventative migraine treatment) eptinezumab,"" he said in a note. ""We understand he has also been closely involved in regulatory processes at his prior organizations, experience which can help with eptinezumab's (application) filing.""RELATED:How Do You Spot A Major Market Top?

2,LLY,"Amgen (AMGN) and Novartis (NVS) shrewdly priced Aimovig below Wall Street's expectations, an analyst said Friday, a day after the drug became the first migraine prevention medication to grab approval in the U.S.The approval comes as President Trump attempts to tamp down drug prices. Aimovig will go for $575 per month, or $6,900 annually. The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review previously estimated drugs in the same class could go for $8,500 per year.Piper Jaffray analyst Christopher Raymond suggested Amgen was trying to avoid a battle with insurers over reimbursement by purposefully setting the price below expectations. Amgen learned that lesson with cholesterol drug, Repatha, he said in a report to clients.""Compared to the PCSK9 payer experience (Repatha), we think this may prove to be a shrewd move by Amgen and Novartis,"" he said. ""We think this will be seen as a reasonable price, which will likely preempt access and reimbursement hurdles.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseOn the stock market today, Amgen stock rose 0.9% to close at 176.30. Shares are consolidating with a buy point at 192.72. Shares of rival Alder Biopharmaceuticals (ALDR) popped 4.5% to close at 15.20. Eli Lilly (LLY) and Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA), which are working on similar drugs, each lifted a fraction.Aimovig and competing drugs from Alder, Lilly and Teva belong to the CGRP class, short for calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor. These drugs work by blocking the receptor to cut down on the number of migraines a patient suffers in a month.Amgen and Novartis are first to gain approval for a CGRP drug. Late Thursday, the Food and Drug Administration approved Aimovig to prevent migraines, both chronic and episodic. Teva, Alder and Lilly will likely follow with their own iterations over the next two years.The label is broad and clean, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said in a note. It doesn't list any cautionary or warning language. Further, ""we believe that Amgen has avoided the pitfalls of excessive pricing in this kind of high-volume indication,"" he said.Amgen estimates there are 10 million patients in the U.S. who could benefit from drugs to prevent migraines. This is the first new class of migraine drugs in nearly three decades, Porges said. Before that, Botox gained approval to prevent migraines in chronic sufferers.Now, Amgen is preparing to jump on its first-mover advantage. It already has a number of patients ready to receive the drug within the next week. Porges ultimately expects Amgen to keep 35%-40% of the market in the long-term as other CGRP drugs come online.Lilly's drug, galcanezumab, will likely gain approval in 2018 with Teva and Alder following over the next two years, Porges said. European officials are now reviewing Aimovig.Aimovig's approval is a de-risking event for Alder, RBC analyst Brian Abrahams said in a report. Alder has been under pressure this year after its chief executive unexpectedly quit in March. The firm previously guided to a launch in 2019.""We believe the price point set by Amgen should enable good patient access and adoption for the class from the start,"" he said. This is ""favorable for Alder's ultimate later entry into this large market with a differentiated product.""Meanwhile, Teva is expected to be delayed until the end of this year over issues at a plant where the active ingredient is made. Analysts expect its drug, fremanezumab, to launch in mid-2019.Abrahams models the overall market for CGRP drugs that prevent migraines to be $10 billion to $20 billion. Long term, Leerink's Porges forecasts Aimovig grabbing $1.7 billion in U.S. sales in 2025, below consensus views for $1.8 billion.RELATED:How To Build Long-Term Profits In Stocks?

3,LLY,"Amgen (AMGN) stock took double hits Tuesday as Dow Jones component Pfizer (PFE) grabbed approval for a knockoff of Amgen's anemia treatment and Eli Lilly (LLY) reported strong results for a competing headache drug.On the stock market today, Amgen stock toppled 2.1% to close at 172.34.

And shares of biotech companies and pharmaceutical companies each fell a fraction.The Food and Drug Administration approved Pfizer's drug called Retacrit midday Tuesday. Retacrit is a biosimilar — and almost identical biologic copy — of Amgen's drug Epogen/Procrit. Epogen/Procrit is an anemia treatment.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UsePfizer's approval isn't a major hit for Amgen's revenue, which saw just $244 million in first-quarter sales of Epogen. Epogen was Amgen's seventh biggest drug in the first quarter, but sales declined 10% vs. the year-earlier period.But others are attempting to copy Amgen's biggest drugs, Neulasta and Enbrel. Neulasta increases bone marrow stimulation. Enbrel treats five chronic diseases including some forms of arthritis and psoriasis. Both are blockbusters.Novartis (NVS) has an Enbrel biosimilar called Erelzi. The drug is approved, but Novartis' unit Sandoz can't launch Erelzi until its patent dispute with Amgen is complete. Novartis' Sandoz, Mylan (MYL) and Coherus Biosciences (CHRS) also are working on biosimilars of Neulasta.Amgen is also rivaling Lilly, Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) and Alder Biopharmaceuticals (ALDR) with a migraine drug in a class called anti-CGRPs, short for calcitonin gene-related peptide. All four firms are working on treatments that would prevent chronic migraines.On Tuesday, Lilly said its medicine, called galcanezumab, met its key goal in a late-stage study of patients with episodic cluster headaches. It reduced weekly cluster headaches compared with a placebo across weeks one to three of a two-month treatment period.A statistically significantly greater percentage of patients treated with Lilly's medicine also saw at least a 50% reduction in weekly attacks compared to placebo at week three. The drug proved safe and tolerable. Lilly's drug is also being studied in migraines.Amgen and Novartis partnered to develop Aimovig. It's likely to be the first in its class to get approval to prevent chronic migraines. The Food and Drug Administration is expected to make a decision about Aimovig later this week.RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityHow To Tame A Volatile Swing Trade With A Half PositionLooking For The Next Nvidia?

4,LLY,"Pfizer's (PFE) blockbuster breast cancer drug, Ibrance, lagged expectations during the first quarter Tuesday as the Dow Jones component saw total revenue stall and issued light guidance for 2018.On the stock market today, Pfizer tumbled 3.3% to close at 35.40. Shares are currently consolidating with a buy point at 39.53.For its first quarter, Pfizer reported adjusted income of 77 cents per share on $12.91 billion in sales. Adjusted income topped views by 3 cents and grew 12%. But sales increased just 1% vs. the year-ago period, and missed the consensus for $13.09 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research.Pfizer cited negative ""customer buying patterns"" for slow sales of Ibrance and Xeljanz in the U.S.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseTotal sales of Ibrance grew 37% to $933 million. That was below expectations for $956.6 million, Reuters said. In the U.S., Ibrance sales rose 19% to $726 million. Pfizer is likely seeing competition from Novartis (NVS) and Eli Lilly's (LLY) rival drugs.Xeljanz, a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, also grew 30% to $326 million across the globe. But that missed expectations for $398.5 million. Xeljanz sales advanced 19% in the U.S. to $253 million.The biggest declines came from Pfizer's unit known as Essential Health, which includes nonviral anti-infectives, biosimilars and injectable medicines. Sales in that business declined 5% to $5.08 billion as the Innovative Health unit grew 6%, raking in $7.83 billion.For the year, Pfizer guided to adjusted earnings of $2.90-$3 per share. The midpoint of guidance missed consensus expectations by a penny. The firm also sees $53.5 billion to $55.5 billion in sales. At the midpoint, Pfizer' sales guidance just lagged views for $54.59 billion.RELATED:How Much Money Do You Need To Start Investing?Investing Basics: How To Sell A StockShould You Buy A Stock Ahead Of Its Earnings Report?

5,LLY,"Eli Lilly (LLY) is trying to ""leapfrog"" Dow Jones stock Merck (MRK) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) with its $1.6 billion acquisition of cancer immunotherapy biotech Armo Biosciences (ARMO), an industry observer said Thursday.Drugmaker Lilly is late to the game in cancer immunotherapy, Brad Loncar told Investor's Business Daily. Loncar runs several biotech stock indexes including the Cancer Immunotherapy Sector Index, which contains Armo. The Loncar Cancer Immunotherapy exchange-traded fund popped 3.6% Thursday.""The leaders are Merck and Bristol-Myers Squibb and Roche (RHHBY),"" he said. ""If you're a company that has completely missed the boat and you want to play in this area, you have to do something to try to leapfrog the competition.""Early Thursday, Lilly made its first big move in the cancer immunotherapy space — an area of medicine in which drugs teach the immune system to fight cancer. Lilly said it would pay $50 per share of Armo in an all-cash deal.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseArmo shares rocketed 67% to close at 49.80, as Lilly stock rose 2% to 80.86. Fellow drug stocks, like Merck and Bristol, both rose less than 1%. Roche, which had a failure early in the day in colon cancer, dipped 1.6% to 27.63.Lilly expects the deal to close by the end of the second quarter. Armo, a late-stage biotech, went public at 17 in January and quickly popped. It was a ""hot"" initial public offering, Loncar said, noting that its price early Thursday indicates investors may expect another bid on it.Leerink analyst Jonathan Chang noted that the acquisition price is a 68% premium over Armo's closing price Wednesday. He initiated coverage of the stock with an outperform rating and 50 price target earlier in the year. On Thursday, he downgraded Armo to market perform.""The deal confirms our investment thesis on Armo and, in our view, could read positively to other emerging immuno-oncology stocks,"" he said. ""It is unclear if other bidders will emerge, given (the) short closing date.""The acquisition makes sense as pharmaceutical stock Lilly tries to assert itself in the cancer immunotherapy space, Loncar said. Armo's lead drug, called pegilodecakin, is known as a cytokine. It boosts the strength of drugs known as PD-1 inhibitors, like Merck's Keytruda and Bristol's Opdivo.Earlier this year, Bristol validated another cytokine drug called NKTR-214 by paying $1.85 billion upfront to partner with Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR) on it. The deal hit a record for an upfront payment in biotech, Loncar said. Now, it's of little surprise that Armo is to be taken out.Loncar has consistently predicted that 2018 would be a big year for biotech deals, mergers and takeouts. The year kicked off with news of Celgene's (CELG) plan to buy Juno Therapeutics and Sanofi's (SNY) bids on Bioverativ (BIVV) and Ablynx (ABLX).But this deal for Armo is a little different, he said.""I think this one would have happened if we were in the middle of a terrible, bear market,"" he said. On the other hand, ""this is also a good example of large companies like Eli Lilly, many of them have not been at the forefront of innovation and they're having to buy into that.""Still, Lilly isn't alone in its trailing position in cancer immunotherapy. Roche, AstraZeneca (AZN) and Pfizer (PFE) all have immuno-oncology drugs, but remain behind Merck and Bristol which are ""on a level of their own,"" he said.The cancer immunotherapy space desperately needed some good news, he said. Earlier this year, Incyte's (INCY) drug, known as an IDO inhibitor, failed in a late-stage combination with Merck's Keytruda in melanoma. Incyte's pain extended to other cancer immunotherapy stocks.Background volatility remains in the cancer immunotherapy space, Loncar said. The key, he said, is that these are all different pieces of technology. The Armo drug is different from the Incyte drug known as epacadostat.""Every news item sets people's moods,"" he said. ""Everybody is down on immunotherapy and thinks it's overrated. Then a deal like this happens and it causes the opposite reaction. Whenever you have an emerging technology like this it's going to be a roller coaster.""RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityHow To Tame A Volatile Swing Trade With A Half PositionLooking For The Next Nvidia?

6,LLY,"Japan's Takeda Pharmaceuticals clinched the $62 billion acquisition of Shire (SHPG) early Tuesday after a six-week tussle between the two companies in which Allergan (AGN) also was briefly interested in a possible merger.If approved, it will be the largest overseas purchase by a Japanese company, according to Dealogic. Dealogic says that with debt, the deal is worth $81.5 billion. Takeda will add its roughly $33 billion market cap to Shire's, which is north of $49 billion. The new Takeda will be close in size to Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and Eli Lilly (LLY).RBC analyst Douglas Miehm said the deal alleviates some concerns, notably that the Japanese drugmaker could de-lever sufficiently and that its dividend will remain intact. The firm expects to general annual pretax cost synergies of $1.4 billion by the end of the third year.""We do anticipate the deal spread to remain wider than normal given the complexity of the transaction requiring approval in various geographies, ability to realize synergies, especially R&D (research and development) and long-dated closing date,"" he said in a note to clients.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe total deal is consistent with Takeda's fifth proposal and values Dublin-based Shire at 49.01 pounds, or about $66.21, per share. All together, Takeda will pay 46 billion pounds, or roughly $62.1 billion. The companies expect the deal to close in the first half of 2019.Under the terms of the deal, Shire shareholders will receive $30.33 in cash and either 0.839 new Takeda shares or 1.678 Takeda American depositary receipts for each Shire share. When the deal wraps, Shire shareholders will own 50% of the new Takeda.Takeda's new shares will also trade on the Tokyo Stock Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange.RBC's Miehm noted that the acquisition is expected to be significantly accretive to earnings from the first full fiscal year following the close. It's also expected to provide a return on interest above Takeda's cost of capital over the same time period.Takeda confirmed that it still needs approval from two-thirds of its existing shareholders. But it is confident it can get those votes, Miehm said. To pay for the acquisition, Takeda entered into a bridge credit agreement — a type of loan — for $30.85 billion.Miehm kept his outperform rating on Shire stock. On the stock market today, Shire rose 1.5% to close at 163.73. That, and first-quarter outperformance from Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX), didn't help drug stocks more broadly, though, which dipped 0.3%.RELATED:How Do You Spot A Major Market Top?

The stock ended the regular trading session down 4.4% to 17.78. Shares are consolidating with a buy point at 22.74. Meanwhile, their generic drugs group dipped a fraction.Mizuho analyst Irina Koffler reiterated her buy rating and 27 price target on Teva. She noted the commentary regarding Teva's preventative chronic migraine drug, called fremanezumab, should help the stock.""Teva indicated that it expects a pre-approval inspection of the Celltrion facility in the coming months and to launch fremanezumab before the end of 2018,"" she said in a report. ""This news may remove a prior concern that weighed on the stock last quarter.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

Adjusted profit of 94 cents a share fell 11.3% but crushed views for 68 cents. Sales came in at $5.07 billion, dipping 10.4%, but that still beat the consensus of analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research for $4.8 billion.Generic drugs, Teva's biggest unit, declined 23% in North America to $1.09 billion. Teva cited price erosion in the U.S. for the slide. But in Europe, Teva's generic drugs climbed 17% to $997 million. Growth in over-the-counter volume was partially offset by price reductions.Sales of multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone tumbled by a third globally to $645 million, but that still beat Koffler's view for $594.5 million. In the U.S., revenue declined by 40% as Copaxone now faces generic copycats from Mylan (MYL) and Novartis (NVS) and its partner Momenta Pharmaceuticals (MNTA).Austedo brought in $30 million, crushing Koffler's estimate for $18 million. The drug was first approved in April 2017 to treat cholera associated with Huntington's disease. In August 2017, it got approval to treat involuntary body movements tied to long-term use of some drugs.Teva also boosted its 2018 guidance and now sees adjusted profit of $2.40-$2.65 per share, up from $2.25-$2.50. At the midpoint, that beat analysts' view for $2.43.

Analysts expected adjusted earnings of $4.88 per share and $23.46 billion in sales.Late Monday, a Food and Drug Administration advisory panel dealt Lilly and partner Incyte (INCY) a setback. The panel opposed approving a new rheumatoid arthritis drug at a higher dose, as the drugmakers wanted. The panel did favor a lower dosage.During the quarter, sales of diabetes drug Trulicity grew 82% to $678.3 million worldwide. In the U.S., Trulicity revenue advanced 78% on higher demand for drugs in its class, known as GLP-1 receptor agonists. At the same time prescriptions for Trulicity grew 71%, Raffat said.""This implies that pricing has not been unfavorable in the GLP-1 class,"" he said.Humalog, another diabetes drug and Lilly's biggest product, grew 12% to $791.7 million in sales. Better pricing drove that growth, Raffat said.Sales of erectile dysfunction drug Cialis seem to be relatively stable in light of generic competition for Pfizer's (PFE) Viagra. In the U.S., Cialis sales grew 6%, ""driven by higher realized prices, largely offset by decreased demand due to the entry of generic sildenafil,"" Lilly said. Worldwide sales fell 7%.Meanwhile, sales of chemotherapy medication Alimta increased 2% to $499.6 million. A 3% decrease in revenue outside the U.S. was offset by an 8% rise in U.S. sales. Alimta is used in combination with Merck's Keytruda to treat lung cancer.But several key drugs fell short, Raffat said.In the U.S., sales of psoriasis treatment Taltz fell by $31.3 million quarter over quarter, ""driven by lower volume due to specialty pharma buying patterns, partially offset by higher demand,"" Lilly said. U.S. sales of $111.2 million missed by $48 million, Raffat said.""This is an important growth product and (it) missed,"" he said.At the same time, U.S. sales of osteoporosis drug Forteo declined 31% to $122.1 million ""due to decreased volume from wholesale and retail buying patterns, and, to a lesser extent, lower realized prices,"" Lilly said.RELATED:How Do You Spot A Major Market Top?

9,LLY,"Merck (MRK) popped to a three-month high Monday after Goldman Sachs suggested its cancer drug, Keytruda, could be a $16 billion asset by 2025.""We believe the narrative of this company is quickly changing with the success of Keytruda driving a significant shift in product mix from a large primary care evolving into a specialty biopharma,"" Goldman Sachs analyst Jami Rubin wrote in a note to clients.Rubin upgraded Merck to a buy rating from neutral, and added the stock to the brokerage's Americas Conviction List. She also boosted her price target to 73 from 63. She raised her expectations for Keytruda by $2 billion in 2021 and by $4 billion in 2025.Also late Monday, European regulators accepted Merck's application of its combination of Keytruda and chemotherapy in untreated lung cancer patients. The decision was made based on the results of a study presented last week called Keynote-189, Merck said.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseOn the stock market today, shares of the Dow Jones component climbed 2.4% to close at 60.25. Earlier, the stock touched its highest point since late January. Meanwhile, rival Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) dipped 0.5% to finish at 50.90.The hoopla surrounding Merck follows the American Association for Cancer Research annual meeting last week. Then, a regimen of Merck's Keytruda and chemotherapy seemingly topped a combination of Bristol's Opdivo and Yervoy as first treatments in lung cancer.Keytruda plus chemo reduced the risk of death by 51%, Merck said. A combination of Opdivo and Yervoy cut the risk of cancer progression or death by 42% in a similar group of patients compared with chemotherapy alone, Bristol said.Now, analysts expect Merck to take the lion's share of an already large lung cancer market. Keytruda and the animal health unit drive Merck's value, Rubin said. She sees the bottom line getting a disproportionate contribution from higher Keytruda sales.Rubin assumes Merck will eventually have roughly half of the immuno-oncology market, up from her earlier estimate for 40%. Immuno-oncology medicines treat cancer by teaching the immune system to identify tumor cells.In 2021, Keytruda will bring in $12 billion with $8 billion of that stemming from sales as a first treatment for advanced lung cancer, she predicted. Rubin expects Keytruda to generate $16 billion by 2025.As a lone therapy, Keytruda will likely get a quarter of the market serving patients whose tumors have a lot of the PD-L1 protein, Rubin said. The amount of PD-L1 is thought to predict how well drugs like Keytruda and Bristol's Opdivo will work. She doesn't expect Bristol's Opdivo to get any of this market.Merck's share of the combination market remains to be determined, she said. Keytruda likely has access to 70% of the lung cancer market. But Bristol and Roche (RHHBY) are still running tests of their rival combinations.""While there is room for further upside if Merck establishes more of a leadership position, we still need to see data from other combination trials to give them more credit,"" she said.Merck could also seek mergers to further diversify, especially as diabetes drug Januvia looks likely to see generic competition in the mid-2020s, Rubin said.""We see potential for Merck to be an even better story if management takes steps to diversify and address longer term growth post-Januvia to complement Keytruda,"" she said. ""And we believe they have more than enough balance sheet firepower to do so.""The firm is now a ""compelling mix and margin improvement story,"" she said. That's mostly been overlooked amid the lung cancer discussion. But, historically, investors reward margin expansions stories.

It will have to face off with Exelixis, which is also testing its kidney cancer drug Cabometyx in liver cancer.""While details surrounding the level of benefit were not disclosed in the press release, Cyramza's historical hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer) data do not lead us to view the drug as a significant threat to Cabometyx,"" RBC analyst Kennen MacKay said in a note to clients.He models Cabometyx taking half of the liver cancer market amid competition and potential combinations with immuno-oncology drugs. Exelixis and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) are testing Cabometyx and immuno-oncology drug Opdivo in liver cancer.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseCyramza improved rates of overall survival when used as a second option for liver cancer patients whose first treatment failed. It also improved the rate of those whose disease was progression free. The study evaluated patients who had failed on, or were intolerant to, a drug known as sorafenib. Sorafenib is sold as Nexavar by Bayer.Lilly limited the study to patients with a high amount of a protein called alpha-fetoprotein, or AFP. About half of all liver cancer patients fall into that bucket. Generally, these patients have the poorest prognosis relative to other liver cancer patients.Lilly was mum on the specifics of its results. But historical data don't bode well, MacKay said.In an earlier study, Cyramza had an overall survival rate of 9.2 months in all patients and 7.8 months in patients with high AFP. To compare, Cabometyx recently showed a 10.2-month overall survival rate in all liver cancer patients.""While AFP appears to be a meaningful prognostic biomarker, Cyramza does not appear to have 'targeted therapy-like effects' on this population, given that overall survival actually declines from 9.2 months in (all patients) to 7.8 months in AFP-high patients,"" he said.MacKay kept his outperform rating on Exelixis stock. On the stock market today, Exelixis jumped 4.8% to close at 22.31. Lilly rose 1.4% to finish at 78.60.RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityHow To Invest In Stocks For Free: New Apps Aim For BeginnersLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

11,LLY,"Incyte (INCY) plummeted Friday after a regimen that combines its immuno-oncology drug with another from Merck (MRK) failed in a late-stage study, prompting the duo to scrap the program.Raymond James analyst Reni Benjamin minced his price target on Incyte to 85 from 159, noting other combinations using Incyte's drug epacadostat with immuno-oncology drugs from Merck, Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and AstraZeneca (AZN) are also likely to be duds.""In our view, this event taints the entire epacadostat franchise and therefore we are removing all revenues associated with melanoma and other indications from our models,"" he wrote in a report to clients. The study ""missed big time.""Shares of Incyte crashed by 22.9% to close at 64.02 on the stock market today. Incyte hit a two-year low, falling as much as 23.2%. Merck, a Dow Jones component, saw shares fall 2.2%, to 53.36. In sympathy, Bristol lost 2.3% to 60.88. AstraZeneca, though, lifted a fraction to 35.42.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe regimen failed to improve progression-free survival in melanoma patients, and looked unlikely to have an impact on overall survival, Incyte said in a news release. The combination tested epacadostat, which inhibits the IDO1 enzyme, with Merck's Keytruda, a PD-1 protein inhibitor.Data from the study will help contribute to the overall understanding of IDO1 inhibition in combination with a PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor, Incyte Chief Medical Officer Steven Stein said.""We remain dedicated to transforming the treatment of cancer and will continue to explore how IDO1 inhibition and other novel mechanisms can potentially improve outcomes for patients in need,"" he said in a written statement.Safety from the combination was in line with previous studies, Incyte said. Patients will move off the regimen ""in a manner consistent with the best interests of each patient.""Incyte is also testing epacadostat in lung cancer patients in combinations with Merck, Bristol and AstraZeneca. Investigators are also looking at epacadostat regimens in kidney, head-and-neck and bladder cancers.Analysts had been bullish on Incyte's chances with epacadostat. Broadly, they theorize that combining immuno-oncology drugs could offer a more potent cancer response.Bristol has been at the forefront of combining immuno-oncology drugs. Its Opdivo, another PD-1 inhibitor, and Yervoy, which is known as a CTLA-4 inhibitor, are approved to treat melanoma. Bristol is also testing the regimen in other cancers.Merck, on the other hand, has worked to combine Keytruda with chemotherapy. U.S. regulators approved the combination as a first treatment for advanced lung cancer. Merck is also studying Keytruda with another investigational PD-1 inhibitor called MK-3475.On Friday, analysts were less bullish on Incyte's shot with epacadostat, but do see some value for Incyte's other drugs including baricitinib, a rheumatoid arthritis drug with Eli Lilly (LLY), and cancer drug ruxolitinib, branded as Jakafi and Jakavi.Raymond James' Benjamin kept his outperform rating on Incyte. He sees Incyte's Jakafi generating $2.5 billion to $3 billion by 2027. It also has the potential to book significant royalties from baricitinib as well as ruxolitinib outside the U.S., which is also sold by Novartis (NVS) as Jakavi.RBC analyst Brian Abrahams chopped his price target on Incyte to 75 from 114, completely discounting epacadostat. He still has an outperform rating on the stock. Like Raymond James' Benjamin, he still sees some value for Jakafi and baricitinib. But he expects Incyte to terminate other epacadostat studies.""Only silver lining in our view is that (the) results were unequivocal and should make future decisions clear,"" he said in a note. ""Based on the data we see very low likelihood any robust signals in biomarker-defined subgroups emerge that would support continuing anything other than studies substantially reduced in scope for exploratory purposes.""RELATED:How To Build Long-Term Profits In Stocks?

12,LLY,"Biohaven Pharmaceuticals (BHVN) cratered by a third early Monday after it unveiled the results of two late-stage trials for its migraine drug, a competitor to an investigational therapy from Allergan (AGN).The drug, called rimegepant, was tested as a treatment for acute migraine. In two Phase 3 trials, rimegepant met its key goal of pain freedom and freedom from the worst symptoms at the two-hour mark. Numerically, though, Allergan's drug had a slight advantage.Piper Jaffray analyst Charles Duncan warned investors against losing the forest for the trees. The effectiveness data show rimegepant is approvable and clinically meaningful, he said in a note to clients. Further, rimegepant continued to improve after the two-hour mark.""We are encouraged to see the delta between rimegepant and the placebo widen past the two-hour time point even without repeat dosing or adjunctive therapy/rescue meds, which to us suggests the candidate is differentiated by prevention of recurrence and lack of any rebound effect,"" he said.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseHe sees Biohaven's rimegepant as a $1 billion drug. He models peak sales of $1.3 billion in 2030.Still, in morning trading on the stock market today, Biohaven fell as much as 33.3% to a low of 16.51. That was below the stock's initial public offering last May at 17. Biohaven ended the regular session Monday down 7.4% to 22.92. Allergan rose 0.5% to 160.21.Between the two trials, 19.6% and 19.2% of patients who received a single 75-milligram dose of Biohaven's drug rimegepant — without repeat dosing or rescue medicines like triptans — were pain free at the two-hour mark vs. 12% and 14.2% of patients who received a placebo.Of those who received rimegepant, 37.6% and 36.6% were free of their worst symptoms at the two-hour point vs. 25.2% and 27.7% of patients who received the placebo.Investors were keyed in to how this would compare vs. Allergan's drug, ubrogepant. Both drugs belong to a class of medicines called anti-CGRPs which aim to block a specific peptide associated with migraines. Biohaven and Allergan's drugs are both being tested orally.Allergan's ubrogepant was tested as 50-milligram and 100-milligram doses, allowing for repeat doses and rescue medicines. After two hours, 19.2% and 21.2% of patients were pain-free vs. 11.8% of placebo patients. The worst symptoms disappeared in 38.6% and 37.7% of patients vs. 27.8% in the placebo group.But ubrogepant patients had liver issues whereas rimegepant didn't. In Allergan's trial, there were six patients whose liver function rose greater than three times the upper limit of normal. A safety board said none of those cases had a probable relationship to the drug.Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges still expects Allergan's ubrogepant to be competitive. Generic triptans make up about 90% of acute migraine prescriptions. But for 75% of patients, they carry severe warnings and about 30%-40% of patients don't respond to triptans.Further, he notes resolution on the liver worries for ubrogepant won't be resolved until long-term safety studies for Allergan's drug are available in the second half of 2018.Rimegepant and ubrogepant differ from other anti-CGRP drugs being investigated which aim to prevent migraines. Amgen (AMGN) and Novartis (NVS) are in the lead on that front. Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA), Eli Lilly (LLY) and Alder Biopharmaceuticals (ALDR) are also working on these drugs.RELATED:How Much Money Do You Need To Start Investing?Long-Term Retirement Investing Strategies With ETFsShould You Buy A Stock Ahead Of Its Earnings Report?

Fed policymakers see two more hikes in 2018 after raising rates on Wednesday.A federal judge OK'd the AT&T-Time Warner deal without conditions, rejecting the Justice Department's argument that the merger could hurt competition in the pay-TV industry. AT&T closed the $85 billion merger on Friday. The landmark ruling boosted share prices in media firms CBS (CBS), Lionsgate (LGF), and Discovery Communications (DISCA). The decision is expected to open the door to more acquisitions of media firms by telecom giants. The deal also bodes well for big vertical health care mergers, including CVS Health (CVS) buying Aetna (AET).Comcast (CMSCA), as expected, launched a takeover bid for 21st Century Fox Entertainment (FOXA), offering $65 billion in cash for Rupert Murdoch's entertainment company, a 19% premium over the Walt Disney (DIS) offer.

Late Tuesday, Alder didn't offer an update to that timeline, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said in a note to clients.""Changing CEOs so close to the finish line is not unheard of in biotech, but neither is it common,"" he wrote.

Analysts said Alder is looking for an executive with more regulatory and commercial experience as the biotech prepares to submit its application for eptinezumab.Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan called the move ""reasonable,"" but surprising considering a new full-time replacement has yet to be identified. Leerink's Porges suggested the transition could have already been planned, but kept under wraps pending pivotal trial data.""This timing and disclosure, which obviously came directly from the board of directors, means that the company is free to openly recruit a leader with the requisite skills and experience or to secure the sale of the company,"" Porges said.Needham analyst Danielle Brill suggested the sudden departure of Schatzman could slightly delay the timing for eptinezumab. But she noted the strategy for eptinezumab is unchanged. Alder is still planning to target about 3,000 specialists with a sales force of 75-125 people.Any delay in eptinezumab could be a headwind, Credit Suisse's Divan said. Eptinezumab is part of a drug class called anti-CGRPs, which target a specific peptide to prevent migraines. Amgen (AMGN)/Novartis (NVS), Eli Lilly (LLY) and Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) are all working in this market.Divan noted the first-quarter conference call will be key on the timing of eptinezumab where ""a delay of even a few months could be very meaningful.""""We also remain concerned as to how (Alder) will compete against three larger players who are well ahead of them in development in a market that will likely also face significant pricing pressures,"" he said.RELATED:How To Build Long-Term Profits In Stocks?

Though it is a surprise as earlier-stage data for the regimen and Cotellic as a single drug were strong, he said.Still, even without the combination, there's not much downside, he said. Cabometyx is approved in kidney cancer. The Food and Drug Administration is also considering it as a treatment for liver cancer.""We're buyers on a dip for anticipated Cabo growth well ahead of Street expectations,"" he said.

Caterpillar (CAT), Verizon (VZ) and United Technologies (UTX) stirred Dow futures early, as crude oil prices gained and investors dug into the session's long list of earnings results.Dow futures rose 0.6%, as Caterpillar forged a strong early lead, but premarket losses from Travelers (TRV) and 3M (MMM) limited gains. S&P 500 futures advanced 0.7%. Nasdaq 100 futures narrowed their early gains to 0.7%, with Paccar (PCAR) leading. But heavy losses from Incyte (INCY) and Biogen (BIIB) tempered the advance.The Dow has logged four straight declines. The Nasdaq has slipped in the past three sessions and the S&P 500 in two of the past three. The results left all three indexes back below resistance at their 50-day moving averages. The declines also pushed the Dow and S&P into negative territory for the year. The Dow industrials ended Monday down 1% for the year. The S&P 500 carried a 0.1% decline.The Nasdaq holds a 3.3% gain.

Germany-based software giant SAP (SAP) marshaled a 4.2% advance. Drugmaker Eli Lilly (LLY) hustled 1.6% higher. Oilfield equipment leader Weatherford International (WFT) scrambled to a 13.3% gain.Among Dow futures, Caterpillar easily led, cranking up a 4.1% gain immediately following its earnings report.

20,LLY,"Analysts weren't surprised Wednesday after Dow's Merck (MRK) terminated a late-stage study of a potential Alzheimer's disease drug and argued that it won't have implications for Biogen (BIIB) which announced an expansion to a key Alzheimer's trial, but Biogen shares fell anyway.X Late Wednesday, after its shares slid as much as 9.1%, Biogen announced it would enroll 510 more patients to the original recruitment plan for its Phase 3 aducanumab trials. Enrollment is still expected to be complete by mid-2018, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges wrote in a note to clients.Biogen's news follows Merck's decision late Tuesday to scrap a study of a drug called verubecestat in patients with early-stage Alzheimer's disease. Verubecestat is known as a BACE inhibitor and aims to prevent the buildup of amyloid plaques in the brain associated with Alzheimer's.""In the context of Merck's recent disappointment with the Merck BACE inhibitor verubecestat, Biogen's aducanumab is one of what is now only a handful of Alzheimer's medicines still active in pivotal trials,"" Porges said.Merck halted a late-stage trial of verubecestat this time last year when investigators found it had ""virtually no chance"" of working in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's. Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan said the failure was a disappointment, but not surprising.""We remained hopeful that the drug would potentially show some benefit if given to patients earlier in the course of the disease,"" he said in a note to clients. ""We now remove all verubecestat revenues from our model.""Divan cut his price target on Merck to 65 from 66, though he kept his outperform rating. Merck will likely have to seek out mergers big enough to ""move the needle"" on a $150 billion market cap company with annual sales north of $40 billion.""The rest of the business is not strong enough to allow for the growth they are seeing in oncology to come through,"" he said. ""While today's news was not unexpected, we do believe it adds incremental pressure on Merck to pursue business development opportunities to bring additional growth drivers into their mid-late-stage pipeline.""IBD'S TAKE: The 50-day moving average can be used to pinpoint times of opportunity or risk in stocks. How? Head to the Investor's Corner for more tips on smart stock buying and selling tips.Evercore analyst Umer Raffat points out ""any failure in the (Alzheimer's) space is never good news."" Others including Biogen/Eisai, Eli Lilly (LLY)/AstraZeneca (AZN), Novartis (NVS) and Dow's Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) are also working on BACE inhibitors.Biogen's aducanumab works differently from the BACE inhibitors. It aims to remove plaque buildup in the brain. Analysts are particularly hopeful for the prospects of aducanumab.""If you look at the actual amount of amyloid plaque reduction with BACE inhibitors, it's dramatically less than what Biogen saw with aducanumab,"" Raffat said in a report. ""This plaque reduction on aducanumab is by the far the most important thing going in Biogen's favor.""RBC analyst Brian Abrahams is more bullish on aducanumab than Biogen/Eisai's BACE inhibitor, elenbecestat.""Though aducanumab also targets beta-amyloid, we would not necessarily make direct read-throughs from failure of a BACE inhibitor to a beta-amyloid targeting monoclonal antibody,"" he said. ""We believe the unknowns about the beta-amyloid hypothesis are already baked into Biogen shares.""On the stock market today, Biogen tumbled 6.6% to close at 296.08. Merck was unchanged at 54.90.RELATED:These Biotechs Could Spring Back After Market Correction: AnalystBiotech Investors Flee In Droves As Market Correction Rocks The GroupThis Biotech Stock Rocketed On An Immuno-Oncology Tie With Bristol

21,LLY,"Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) jumped Monday after grabbing an upgrade and a price target boost on its 2018 restructuring plan which looks ""more reasonable,"" one analyst said.X Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan upgraded Teva to an outperform rating from neutral and raised his price target to 23 from 20. Last week, Teva updated investors on its plan, which includes a new organizational structure and cutting its workforce by 14,000.The firm is also closing six plants and plans to announce another six closures by the end of 2018. It's also examining its portfolios and cut 27% of specialty programs. By year's end, Teva expects to achieve at least half the $3 billion spending cut it has planned.""Now that we have more details on the plan, including a 2018 outlook that we believe is achievable and we are seeing signs of early execution toward that plan, we are taking the additional step and upgrading Teva shares,"" Divan said in a note to clients.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Teva popped 3.6% to finish at 19.27.Guidance for $18.3 billion to $18.8 billion in sales for the year includes the potential impact of a generic version of Teva's multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone 40-milligram. Teva said on its earnings conference call that the first quarter should be the strongest.IBD'S TAKE: Teva is trading in line with its 50-day moving average. But what does that line mean and is it at risk? Head to the Investor's Corner for a closer look at using the 50-day moving average to pinpoint opportunity or risk.Mylan (MYL) already has approval of a Copaxone copycat. Dr. Reddy's Laboratories (RDY) is delayed on its generic, but Momenta Pharmaceuticals (MNTA) and Novartis' (NVS) Sandoz unit should have a generic on the market this year, analysts say.Copaxone was ""the one bright spot"" in the fourth quarter, Divan said. Revenue of $821 million declined 19% but held up better than expected. He assumes a second generic will enter the market in the first half of 2018 and sees rapid sales erosion through 2019.A delay to Teva's migraine drug is a new negative, but was expected, Divan said. In that class of drugs, called CGRP inhibitors, Teva is rivaling Amgen (AMGN), Eli Lilly (LLY) and Alder Biopharmaceuticals (ALDR).""We believe the migraine market is large enough for multiple blockbusters, even if Teva is third or fourth to the market,"" he said.U.S. generics are likely to continue facing challenges in 2018 amid pricing pressure, an acceleration in Food and Drug Administration approvals of competing generics and difficulty in acquiring share from drug originators, he said.Divan expects U.S. generic sales of $4 billion in 2018 declining to $3.8 billion in 2019 and then facing single-digit declines beyond that.""However, here as well we believe expectations entering 2018 are more reasonable than what they have been in the past, providing an opportunity for the company to meet or beat expectations as we move forward,"" he said.RELATED:Regeneron Could Benefit From 'Lackluster' Data Presented By These RivalsCan CRISPR And These 3 Small Biotechs Cure 10,000 DiseasesThese Biotechs Could Spring Back After Market Correction: Analyst

22,LLY,"Veeva Systems (VEEV) is a ""coiled spring"" ready to jump, thanks to several growth initiatives.XThat's the contention of Canaccord Genuity analyst Richard Davis, who says Veeva stock has had a mighty run so far in 2018. He adds the cloud-computing firm that focuses on software applications for the pharmaceutical and life-sciences fields has room for further growth.In using the term ""coiled spring"" to describe Veeva's outlook, Davis says the future looks even more prosperous when 2019 comes into view.""Veeva has several growth initiatives in process that range from significant new feature upsells to adjacent customer breadth moves,"" Davis said in a recent note to clients.Pleasanton, Calif.-based Veeva has more than 600 customers in the life-sciences industry, ranging from Big Pharma firms to emerging biotechs.It counts companies like Amgen (AMGN), Eli Lilly (LLY), Merck (MRK), Novartis (NVS) and Pfizer (PFE) among its customers.Veeva went public in October 2013 at $20 a share, and hit an all-time high of 78.28 on March 8. It managed to avoid most of the carnage in this week's sell-off and shares were down 1% Friday to 74.30.Veeva stock broke out of a 38-week consolidation period with a buy point of 68.17 on Feb. 28, a day after the company posted better-than-expected results for the fiscal fourth quarter and gave guidance that crushed Wall Street's estimates for the current fiscal year.For its current fiscal year, which will end next Jan. 31, Veeva expects to earn an adjusted $1.32 a share, up 43% year over year, on sales of $818 million. That's up 19%, based on the midpoint of its guidance. Analysts were modeling adjusted profit of $1.01 a share on $807 million in sales.Veeva's growth initiatives are likely to reach sufficient scale this year to provide a path to upside to 2019 estimates, Davis said.""If this scenario is correct, investors will figure this out sometime this summer or fall at which point Veeva shares could sustainably move higher,"" he said. Davis rates Veeva stock as buy.Veeva began in 2007 with a software application to help pharmaceutical sales reps organize drug data to make stronger doctor pitches. Today, that product for customer relationship management — called Veeva CRM — dominates the drug market with roughly 80% user share. It's now part of Veeva's Commercial Cloud business.A big driver of the company's business today is Veeva Vault, which launched in 2011. It was created to organize all content involved in clinical drug trials — documents, patient data and work flow. Vault products now cover the clinical, quality, regulatory and commercial aspects of drug development, manufacturing and sale. It has penetrated less than 10% of the market, William Blair analyst Bhavan Suri told Investor's Business Daily.Veeva also has discovered that its Vault offering is useful for other heavily regulated industries, such as the chemical and consumer product sectors.The company's offering for companies outside of life sciences is called Vault QualityOne. It has more than 20 companies using the product, which launched about a year ago.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

""Veeva is uniquely positioned there to help streamline drug development since we're the only technology provider with best-in-class application suites across each of the major areas of development; including clinical, quality, regulatory, and coming next year, safety, all in a single, modern cloud platform. We believe Veeva Development Cloud will be transformational for the industry over the long term.""Veeva's software-as-a-service offering has been replacing legacy vendors that use on-premise hardware and software systems. Its rivals include Oracle (ORCL), Medidata Solutions (MDSO), IQvia (IQV) and others.Veeva management has a strong track record of delivering growth and is conservative in its guidance, William Blair's Suri said. He rates Veeva stock as outperform.Veeva has forecast a revenue run rate of $1 billion by the fourth quarter of 2020.""We think they will hit that run rate by early next year — 18 months plus ahead of expectations,"" Suri said. ""Not only could they hit that billion-dollar run rate early next year, but the sustainability of growth should be there for the next two or three years.""Meanwhile, JPMorgan downgraded Veeva stock from overweight to neutral on March 9, citing valuation concerns after the stock had climbed 40% for the year.""This is a strong franchise that is executing well on a number of growth initiatives,"" but has little room for outperformance at current levels, JPMorgan analyst Sterling Auty said in his note to clients.He estimates Veeva's addressable market at about $5 billion, a fraction of the more than $50 billion spent each year by life-sciences companies on information technology.""This fertile market should provide greater than 20% growth in subscription revenue in fiscal 2019 after growing 26% in fiscal 2018,"" Auty said.RELATED:Veeva Rockets After Topping Quarterly Estimates, Crushing Guidance ViewsCEO Gassner Makes Sure Veeva Has A 'Second Act' — And More

23,LLY,"A dozen drugs launching in 2018 from heavy hitters like Roche (RHHBY), Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) are expected to reach blockbuster status by the end of 2022, an analytics firm says.Clarivate Analytics describes 2018 as ""the year of the blockbuster,"" in which these 12 drugs have either launched or are expected to launch, and eventually bring in north of $1 billion in sales over a five-year period. That's the biggest number since Clarivate began making its forecast in 2013.It's setting up ""to be an exciting year that will see valuable additions to existing treatments as well as disruptions to certain markets and first-in-class treatment options for some diseases,"" the firm said in its report, issued late Thursday.By the end of 2022, three drugs from Roche, Gilead and Novo Nordisk (NVO) are expected to top $3 billion each in annual sales with the remaining nine likely to account for $1 billion to $2 billion a year in revenue, analysts said.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAmong the 12 are two diabetes drugs, a Food and Drug Administration-approved medicine derived from cannabis plants and the first in a series of drugs expected to prevent migraines in some patients. In all, these dozen drugs are projected to collectively top $22.5 billion in sales in 2022.Roche's Hemlibra, a treatment for some patients with hemophilia A, tops the list and is expected to generate north of $4 billion in sales in 2022. Though there only 350,000 hemophilia A patients in the world — with roughly 30% of them eligible for Hemlibra — the treatment costs $482,000 the first year and $448,000 every year after that.The drug was approved three months early and launched in December 2017. Sales of $496 million are forecast for 2018 with the drug set to reach blockbuster status in 2019 at a forecasted $1.46 billion.Hemlibra is expected to take share from Shire's (SHPG) Feiba and Novo Nordisk's NovoSeven.Hemlibra also will compete against Bioverativ's (BIVV) Eloctate and Shire's Advate. For 2018, Eloctate was forecast to be a blockbuster, but Advate will continue to be the market leader with an estimated $1.8 billion in sales.""However, (Advate) sales are forecast to decline further thereafter,"" the Clarivate report said.Gilead's Biktarvy grabbed approval in February and targets an estimated 37 million people globally living with HIV. Of those, 21 million are receiving antiretroviral therapy which suppresses viral replication and allows the immune system to strengthen.Biktarvy adds to Gilead's HIV franchise which has long rivaled that of GlaxoSmithKline (GSK). The two have traded market share since 2006 when Gilead first entered the market with Atripla. Two of Gilead's HIV drugs were featured in Clarivate's 2016 Drugs to Watch report.In 2019, Biktarvy will become a blockbuster, generating $2.28 billion in sales before spiking to $4.3 billion in 2021 and declining to $3.72 billion in 2022, the report says. The trajectory is similar to GSK drug Triumeq, which is expected to bring in $3.68 billion this year, five years after its launch.Rounding out the top three, Novo Nordisk got approval for diabetes drug Ozempic in December. The drug helps stimulate the body's own insulin release and limit how much sugar gets into the blood from the liver, and slows down how quickly food leaves the stomach.Ozempic is expected to become a blockbuster in 2020 with $1.58 billion in revenue on its way to $3.47 billion in 2022.In 2017, immuno-oncology treatments from Novartis (NVS) and Gilead grabbed headlines for ""their ability to revolutionize the treatment of the disease,"" the report said. And more than half of all drugs on the potential blockbuster list were cancer therapies.But in 2018 just one drug on the list of expected blockbusters is a cancer treatment.Erleada, a product of Dow Jones component Johnson & Johnson, was approved in February to treat castration-resistant prostate cancer that hasn't spread across the body. J&J and fellow Dow Jones component Pfizer (PFE) have drugs that treat the same cancer once it's spread.""While Zytiga and Xtandi battle to expand their market share, including the market for patients with non-metastatic disease, J&J's second-generation oral anti-androgen, Erleada, became the first approved in that setting in mid-February 2018,"" Clarivate said.The drug is projected to bring in $1.2 billion in 2020 and rise to $2 billion in 2022. It also could be expanded to treat other forms of prostate cancer and in combination with J&J's Zytiga contribute to its blockbuster potential.In 2021, GSK's shingles vaccine, called Shingrix, and a rare disease drug from Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (ALNY) known as patisiran are expected to join the blockbuster list with $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion in sales, respectively.Revenue is expected to hit a respective $1.37 billion and $1.21 billion in 2022.GW Pharmaceuticals (GWPH) is expected to grab approval this summer for the first cannabidiol drug derived from the cannabis plant to treat patients with two seizure disorders. In 2022, the drug, called Epidiolex, is expected to generate $1.19 billion in sales.""If approved, Epidiolex will likely encounter bureaucratic barriers to distribution and political hurdles associated with cannabis-derived medicines, particularly in the U.S., where strict guidelines for use of medicinal cannabis exist,"" the report said.But the biotech isn't alone in this market. Cara Pharmaceuticals (CARA), Insys Therapeutics (INSY) and Zynerba Pharmaceuticals (ZYNE) are also working on treatments based on the cannabis plant.A migraine drug from Amgen (AMGN) and Novartis, Aimovig, is projected to bring in $115 million in 2018 sales before spiking to $1.17 billion in 2022 sales. This drug, and others like it, seek to prevent migraines by blocking a specific peptide, or group of amino acids.If approved, Aimovig would be the first drug known as an anti-CGRP to market, ahead of Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA), Alder Biopharmaceuticals (ALDR) and Eli Lilly (LLY). Allergan (AGN) also is working in this area.""A first-in-class mover advantage will be crucial for Aimovig since competition from two other subcutaneously administered monoclonal antibodies targeting CGRP is not far behind,"" Clarivate said. Lilly and Teva filed for FDA approval of their drugs late last year.Meanwhile, Alder is in Phase 3 testing with its drug. Analysts are worried, though, that Alder may falter in submitting its application to the FDA after co-founder Randall Schatzman unexpectedly stepped down from his chief executive role on Tuesday.In other areas, Shire's lanadelumab, a treatment for a swelling disorder, is forecast to bring in $1.15 billion in 2022. Next is AbbVie's (ABBV) Elagolix, a treatment for painful symptoms associated with menstruation.Rounding out the list, Pfizer and Merck's (MRK) diabetes drug Steglatro and Indivior's opioid dependence drug Sublocade are forecast to become blockbusters in 2022 with $1.09 billion and $1.07 billion in sales, respectively.RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityHow Much Money Do You Need To Start Investing?How To Build Long-Term Profits In Stocks?

26,LLY,"A migraine prevention treatment from Eli Lilly (LLY) faces an uphill battle against Amgen (AMGN) which, late Thursday, had strong results from long-term studies of its approved medicine.Both Amgen and Lilly have migraine prevention drugs called anti-CGRPs. These drugs work by blocking a specific peptide associated with migraines. Amgen's drug, Aimovig, grabbed approval in May, but Lilly's is fast approaching approval, likely in September.Although Allergan's (AGN) Botox is well known as a treatment for wrinkles and facial lines, it has other uses in excessive sweating, urinary incontinence and to prevent migraines. On Wednesday, Lilly showed that its drug, called Emgality, can benefit patients for whom Botox didn't prevent migraines.But RBC Capital Markets analyst Kennen MacKay doesn't expect the study to ""substantially impact positioning in the marketplace.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""We do find the post-Botox analysis to provide a unique perspective and marketing point for Emgality with the physicians who have established familiarity with Botox and the estimated 50% of patients that may step through Botox to CGRP therapy,"" he said in a report.On the stock market today, Lilly advanced 1% at the closing bell, to 85.49. Amgen sank 0.1%, to 183.34. Shares of pharmaceutical and biotech companies each rose a fraction.Late Wednesday, Lilly said Emgality benefited some patients for whom Botox didn't work to prevent migraines.Lilly tested its anti-CGRP at 120-milligram and 240-milligram doses in patients who failed on Botox as a migraine prevention treatment. On average, 41.3% and 47.5%, respectively, saw their migraine days per month cut in half.""These data are compelling given that Botox is a commonly used agent in the prophylactic treatment paradigm for migraine, and could potentially be required as a step-through therapy prior to treatment with the CGRP class,"" RBC's MacKay said.But Lilly will continue to face an uphill battle against Amgen, MacKay said. U.S. officials approved Aimovig in May. The drug already has an established safety and effectiveness profile. It also beat rivals Lilly, Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) and Alder Biopharmaceuticals (ALDR) to market.""We expect that Aimovig will continue to benefit from their first-to-market status,"" he said.But MacKay doesn't expect Aimovig to completely fill the revenue hole Amgen faces amid a growing list of challenges for its legacy products. Notably, three of Amgen's drugs are facing potential competition from biosimilars, nearly identical drugs.Further, Amgen partners with Novartis (NVS) on Aimovig, meaning it will have to share sales.Amgen is more bullish, though. The biotech released results on Wednesday of a survey of 11,000 patients who experience at least four migraines per month. Six in 10 respondents said they missed at least a week of work each month due to migraines.Effective migraine prevention could help ease an estimated $22 billion annually in economic cost, Amgen said. About half of that is due to lost productivity. Additional data show patients are often reluctant to admit suffering from a migraine.This suggests the ""already extremely large market could see potential upside beyond the incident and prevalent populations estimated in medical literature, as well as the numbers underpinning assumptions in our model,"" MacKay said.MacKay estimates that there are 2.4 million chronic and 4.3 million episodic migraine patients in the U.S.""However, despite potential for the migraine market to be significantly larger vs. established literature, we see (Amgen's) base business erosion creating a significant/challenging revenue hole to fill, especially given Aimovig revenues are shared with partner Novartis,"" he said.Late Thursday, Amgen said Aimovig was tested for a year in chronic migraine patients. The biotech also took an interim look at data three years into an ongoing five-year study in episodic migraine patients. Researchers tested patients at doses of 140 milligrams and 70 milligrams.On average, patients saw their migraine day per month decline by a respective 10.5 days and 8.5 days. Monthly migraine days declined by half for 67% and 53% of patients, respectively. Those days also dropped by three-quarters in 42% and 27% of patients, respectively.Just 13% of patients on the 14-milligram dose and 6% of patients on the 70-milligram dose had no migraine days.""These data showing sustained (effectiveness) and consistent safety and tolerability of Aimovig over an extended period of time are important for migraine patients and their clinicians to know,"" Stewart Tepper, professor of neurology at Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth Medical School, said in a prepared statement.RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityHow To Trade Stocks: Why Most Penny Stocks Fail To Make Investors RichSell And Take Profits Or Hold?

27,LLY,"When Kris Bakowski was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in 2002, the Georgia resident felt relieved to finally put a name to the fog that was slowly enveloping her brain, even if there was no viable Alzheimer's treatment.For months, she would forget her own phone number. She had trouble with colleagues' names. Mapping out her route home from work became a chore. One day she found herself alone at the mall without any recollection where she was or how she got there.Biopharma companies believe they might be able to help soon. Analysts say Biogen (BIIB) could be first to crack the code on a disease-modifying Alzheimer's treatment that slows the disease's progression. Indeed, Biogen and Tokyo-based Eisai announced late Thursday that Phase 2 tests on their Alzheimer's drug slowed progression of the disease after 18 months. The news sent Biogen stock soaring by more than 23% at one point Friday.Novartis (NVS), Roche (RHHBY), Amgen (AMGN) and others also are developing potential Alzheimer's drugs, along with a number of development-stage biotech companies.Victory is not certain, though. A number of Big Pharma companies, including Merck (MRK), Eli Lilly (LLY) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), have been down this road and abandoned planned Alzheimer's treatments. But at least one expert sees success in the next decade, which wouldn't come too soon for Bakowski and other Alzheimer's patients.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBakowski, now 62, has been blogging about her Alzheimer's experience for 15 years. In a blog post for the Alzheimer's Association, she describes the eight months of testing that led to her diagnosis and subsequent relief. She's hopeful for a cure in her son's lifetime, but her family isn't so optimistic.""My husband likened it to the Titanic — that the ship was sinking, and he and my son were going to survive and I wasn't,"" she wrote. ""My son reflected that it was like his mother was on death row, but innocent of the crime.""The potential Alzheimer's market is massive. An estimated 5.7 million Americans are living with Alzheimer's or other forms of dementia. Without a way to intervene, the Alzheimer's Association expects the cost of caring for people with these diseases to hit $1.1 trillion by 2050, in today's dollars. That would be up from an estimated $277 billion in 2018.But, like Bakowski, many experts are hopeful.Privately held Proclara Biosciences is among a cadre of biotech companies aiming to develop an Alzheimer's treatment. Chief Medical Officer David Michelson calls the field ""pretty vibrant.""Michelson, who has held positions at Merck and Lilly, says the steady drumbeat of ""bad news"" in Alzheimer's treatments reflects not so much a failure to affect their specific targets in the brain but issues such as side effects in specific tests. He recently spoke during a webinar hosted by Endpoints News.""There's a lot of really tremendous work that's ongoing and it's enabling new approaches that are becoming possible and generating promising new targets,"" he said. ""I am actually very hopeful and optimistic about what the next five to 10 years hold for research in Alzheimer's.""Several drugs have been approved in the U.S. to treat dementia of the Alzheimer's type, including Aricept from Eisai and Namenda from Allergan (AGN). Both treat the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. Neither can cure the disease.Elliot Goldstein, chief executive of ProMIS Neurosciences, can count these types of treatment on one hand. None of them slow the progression of the disease, he told Investor's Business Daily. ProMIS is also working on an Alzheimer's treatment. It trades on the Toronto Stock Exchange for under 1 and doesn't have any sales or earnings yet. Goldstein previously worked at Novartis, which is also developing Alzheimer's drugs.Biogen's strongest hope is a drug now dubbed aducanumab. Goldstein predicts the drug will come to market in 2020.""Aducanumab has a high potential of approval because it has showed a small improvement on decline"" of patients into Alzheimer's symptoms, he said.Biogen did not respond to a request for comment for this article.Visit the IBD Stock Checkup to see how Biogen rates now on key fundamental and technical metrics.In total, Biogen has six potential Alzheimer's treatments in its pipeline. Aducanumab is farthest along, with a late-stage study likely to have data in 2019 or 2020, analysts say.Biogen and Eisai's Thursday announcement involved another drug known as BAN2401. Tests involved 856 patients diagnosed with early Alzheimer's. The companies said the drug, an antibody, achieved ""statistical significance on key predefined endpoints"" that evaluated effectiveness at 18 months. Biogen stock jumped 19.6% to close at 357.48 but had surged to an intraday high of 367.89 for a gain of 23.1% at one point.Still, it's a messy field. Biogen stock plunged 6.6% on Valentine's Day this year after it added 510 new patients to an ongoing study of aducanumab. That move caught investors off-guard. Also that week, Merck scrapped a late-stage Alzheimer's treatment study as the risks looked likely to outweigh benefits.""It can be a volatile area,"" Canaccord analyst Sumant Kulkarni told Investor's Business Daily. ""There have been very spectacular failures in the past. There's a component of the investor who thinks, 'What if the next one works?' That can help from a stock point of view.""Then again, he said, ""Nothing else has worked in the past.""The trouble in Alzheimer's treatment research is that scientists aren't exactly sure what causes the disease. One prevailing theory ties the disease to the buildup of toxic plaque in the brain. That happens when a protein called beta-amyloid structurally changes. Beta-amyloid is sticky and clumps together, becoming plaque.Pharmaceutical companies are looking at two approaches to beta-amyloid that essentially boil down to either removing it or preventing it. BACE inhibitors work to prevent the buildup, while monoclonal antibodies — like Biogen's aducanumab — aim to remove it.ProMIS' Goldstein notes adverse events also must be sidestepped. Some Alzheimer's treatments come with a side effect known as amyloid-related imaging abnormalities, or ARIA. This refers to swelling in the brain. Goldstein says ProMIS' Alzheimer's treatment, set to begin clinical studies in 2019, doesn't cause that.But Mizuho analyst Salim Syed says it's possible to help patients get past ARIA. A common idiom of the industry is, ""If you don't get ARIA, are you really treating the plaque?"" he told IBD.Then, there's the trouble of determining whether a study is designed well, Proclara's Michelson says. First, evidence must show the drug engaged the intended target, like beta-amyloid. Second, patients must be proven to actually have Alzheimer's. Third, the study must be big and of appropriate duration.""It turns out when you look back across history, there aren't that many studies and that many drugs that have been studied in a way that really fulfills all three of these elements,"" he said.He argues that only two studies have hit all three design goals. They are Merck's now-failed BACE inhibitor known as verubecestat and Biogen's aducanumab.In February, Merck scrapped a study of its Alzheimer's treatment in patients with prodromal, or very early-stage, Alzheimer's disease. A year earlier, it said the same drug had ""virtually no chance of finding a positive effect"" in patients with mild or moderate forms of the disease.Meanwhile, the field is thinning. J&J stopped a midstage test of a BACE inhibitor in a group of patients in May because of liver safety concerns. In January, Pfizer (PFE) stopped all research in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.Lilly's Alzheimer's treatment failure in late 2016 was acutely painful for the company. Its monoclonal antibody called solanezumab lost out in three late-stage studies. The last study was in patients with a mild form of Alzheimer's.ProMIS' Alzheimer's treatment binds to several toxic misfolded proteins causing Alzheimer's, Goldstein says. It functions on the theory that there are other targets in Alzheimer's disease outside of beta-amyloid. Some drugs are also testing the theory that tangles of a protein called tau could be the root cause.Privately held United Neurosciences hopes to come in with a vaccine for Alzheimer's. The goal is to use the drug as both a treatment for early Alzheimer's and as a preventive measure. Physicians must administer the drug before ""it's too late to rescue the brain,"" United Neurosciences Chief Medical Officer Ajay Verma told Investor's Business Daily.Verma's background is at Biogen, where he directed the development of drugs, including aducanumab. Before that, he was at Merck and Novartis.Verma expects aducanumab to get approval. Several sell-side analysts model around a 35% likelihood that aducanumab can appease the Food and Drug Administration.But Verma sees a possibility that aducanumab could be expensive, since it would be the first treatment to slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease. ""I think the challenge is, will it be a solution or just for the rich?"" he said.Verma ultimately expects the solution to treating Alzheimer's disease to lie in combinations of drugs. That's been key in treating cancer, HIV, cardiovascular disease, metabolic disease and high cholesterol, he says.Without intervention, the number of Alzheimer's patients will triple by 2050, James Hendrix said in Endpoints News' webinar. Hendrix is the director of global science initiatives for the Alzheimer's Association.""We need better therapies and we need them sooner rather than later,"" Hendrix said.But Alzheimer's treatment studies are tricky, United Neurosciences' Verma says. A barrier between the blood and the brain makes getting a drug to the brain difficult. Plus, animal models aren't particularly predictive, and studies must run for long periods of time.Further complicating matters, science isn't sure which stage is the best to treat.Those reasons are at the center of a 0.5% approval rate from the FDA for Alzheimer's treatments, according to a 2015 paper presented by Hendrix. The industry average is 4.1%.Research is improving, though, Hendrix says. Scientists are aware of the potential impact of beta-amyloid and tau, as well as a number of approaches targeting different stages. In the end, it could be enough for an Alzheimer's treatment to just delay the beginning of the disease by several years, he says.""It might be possible to delay the onset for us to die of something else,"" he said.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Stock Market Forecast For The Next Six Months: What You Should ExpectHow To Build Long-Term Profits In Stocks?

28,LLY,"Alder Biopharmaceuticals (ALDR) stock gapped up Friday after rival Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) scrapped a late-stage study of its anti-CGRP migraine prevention drug in chronic cluster headaches.At the closing bell on the stock market today, Alder popped 6.7%, to 17.65. Shares of Teva dipped a fraction, to 23.76. Rival Eli Lilly (LLY) rose a fraction and Amgen (AMGN), which was the first to get a migraine prevention drug to market, dipped 0.4%.Teva studied fremanezumab in chronic and episodic cluster headaches, as well as a long-term safety study. Researchers found fremanezumab is unlikely to work in chronic cluster headaches during the 12-week treatment period, and ended that study.Fremanezumab belongs to a class called anti-CGRP drugs, which aim to block a specific peptide associated with migraines. It's possible anti-CGRP drugs could have other uses, Teva spokesperson Tushar Shah said in a statement.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""While we are disappointed with this outcome, we remain optimistic that fremanezumab could have clinical benefits in additional conditions, beyond migraine, where calcitonin gene-related peptide plays a contributory role in their pathophysiology,"" he said.Amgen and partner Novartis (NVS) grabbed approval in May for anti-CGRP drug Aimovig in migraine prevention. For the week ended June 8, Aimovig prescriptions grew 103% week over week to 1,565, RBC analyst Kennan MacKay said in a note.Alder is testing its drug, eptinezumab, as a preventive treatment for episodic and chronic migraines. It also has a migraine prevention drug in preclinical studies. Lilly's galcanezumab is under review in migraine prevention and is also being studied in cluster headaches.Meanwhile, Biohaven Pharmaceutical (BHVN) has an anti-CGRP drug in development as an acute treatment for migraines. It's also testing another anti-CGRP drug to treat and prevent migraines.

29,LLY,"Plunging shares of Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) weighed on generic drug stocks Thursday after sales and profits continued to drop and it offered weak 2018 guidance, all on top of word of a potential delay for its key migraine drug.X For the fourth quarter, Teva brought in adjusted profit of 93 cents per share on $5.46 billion in sales, declining 32.6% and 15.9%, respectively. Sales of multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone declined 19% to $821 million amid growing generic competition.For the year, Teva sees adjusted profit of $2.25-$2.50 per share on $18.3 billion to $18.8 billion in sales, lagging the consensus for $2.93 and $19.17 billion, respectively. Teva's outlook reflects the likelihood of increasing challenges.""Management noted that roughly half that decline reflects the impact of the loss of exclusivity on Copaxone 40 milligrams,"" Piper Jaffray analyst David Amsellem said in a note to clients. ""A significant chunk of the decline also, and not surprisingly, reflects continued pressure in the U.S. generics business.""By the closing bell on the stock market today, Teva plunged 10.6% to close at 18.64 though earlier it fell as much as 12.6%. Generic drug stocks collectively dipped 3%.Analysts say rival Mylan's (MYL) new Copaxone generic is priced at a 30% discount to Teva's branded drug. Dr. Reddy's Laboratories (RDY) is delayed, but Momenta Pharmaceuticals (MNTA) and Novartis (NVS) unit Sandoz should have a 40-milligram generic on the market this year after a Pfizer (PFE) manufacturing facility passed its re-inspection.Generic drug sales fell 16% year over year to $3.11 billion. In 2017, Teva recorded $17.1 billion in goodwill impairments related to its U.S. generics business. Pricing pressure, government regulation, accelerated generic approvals in the U.S. and delays in launches continue to be challenges.While sales were down, Teva profits and revenue both topped the consensus of analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research for adjusted profit of 81 cents a share on $5.3 billion in sales. Copaxone sales also beat the consensus view for $611 million, Mizuho analyst Irina Koffler said in a note to clients. Still, she expects another generic entrant in mid-2018.IBD'S TAKE: Teva's Relative Strength Rating has been on the rise this month. It now has an RS Rating of 86 out of a best-possible 99. See what goes into that rating by visiting IBD Data Stories.Further, Teva said the manufacturer of the active pharmaceutical ingredient used in its migraine drug, fremanezumab, received a warning letter from the Food and Drug Administration regarding the fill/finish part of its facility. This means fremanezumab could be delayed.Fremanezumab is currently set to go before the FDA in June. The drug belongs to a class known as anti-CGRPs, which aim to prevent migraines. Alder Biopharmaceuticals (ALDR), Amgen (AMGN) and Eli Lilly (LLY) are all working on drugs in this class.""This is another source of anxiety surrounding a business that simply cannot afford to have additional missteps, particularly in the context of a highly competitive anti-CGRP/migraine space,"" Amsellem said.RELATED:Sanofi, Regeneron Dip As Eczema Drug Dupixent Lags In EuropeCan CRISPR And These 3 Small Biotechs Cure 10,000 Diseases?These Biotechs Could Spring Back After Market Correction: Analyst

30,LLY,"The best sector mutual funds last year thrived in several areas, and the number of funds winning IBD Mutual Funds 2018 Awards jumped to 32 from the previous year's 13.This year the best sector mutual funds represented technology, defense and aerospace, media and telecom, health care and retail. Each of the top-performing sector funds not only surpassed the S&P 500 in the past one, three, five and 10 years, but was also the top fund in its sector ranked by 10-year performance.According to Morningstar, a sector mutual fund invests solely in a general industry — such as technology — or in a more specific industry, like an internet company. But there can be a great deal of overlap among the sectors. For example, Amazon.com featured heavily in three of the five featured sector funds — technology, retail and media — while other FANG stocks held prominent roles as well.The components and weighting within the fund dictate its performance compared with the S&P 500.Technology stocks were among the year's best performers, as institutions flocked to the leading names — like the FANG stocks — in the sector.T. Rowe Global Technology (PRGTX) was the top fund within the U.S. technology sector, coming in with a 47.04% return in 2017, more than doubling the S&P 500's 21.83% return and also trouncing the tech-heavy Nasdaq's 28.2% return. The fund targets potential winners within specific technological themes, like cloud computing.Holdings that drove 2017's outperformance include Big Cap 20 member Salesforce.com (CRM) and FANG stocks Netflix (NFLX) and Amazon.com (AMZN) — a position which has since been sold. The fund also saw big gains from Chinese stock leaders Tencent (TCEHY) and Alibaba (BABA).Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAs of Dec. 31, the fund had nearly 35% of its assets in its top five holdings, which are exhibiting strong fundamental and technical action.New top holdings include dynamic electric automaker Tesla (TSLA) and Broadcom (AVGO). Shares of Tesla moved up 46% in 2017, but have been mostly stagnant since September 2017. Since then, the stock has been trading sideways in a range from 290 to about 360.Meanwhile, Apple-supplier Broadcom fell victim to slowing iPhone sales, as the stock fell 21% from its highs in early February. The stock is consolidating at its 50- and 200-day moving average lines.The defense industry saw strong gains in 2017, as President Trump boosted military spending.  Blue chip stock and defense leader Boeing (BA) paced the advancers with a gain of nearly 90%.Fidelity Select Defense & Aerospace (FSDAX) jumped 34.21% in 2017. Its top holdings include Dow Jones Industrials name Boeing, Northrop Grumman (NOC) and General Dynamics (GD).While Boeing and Northrop — up 32% in 2017 — are extended from recent buy points, General Dynamics hasn't had the same torrid advanced and is near a 229.64 flat-base entry.Social media has become a major segment of the media & telecom sector and no company has a larger social media impact than Facebook (FB).T. Rowe Media & Telecommunications (PRMTX) rose 32.99% in 2017. According to Morningstar, the fund is a bit different from the other sector funds in the communications category. While the fund has several communication tower names like American Tower (AMT) and Crown Castle (CCI), it also looks for high-growth companies that are disrupting the industry, like Amazon.The two tower companies had gains of 35% and 28%, respectively, in 2017. As such, the fund's performance was driven by its top three holdings: Amazon.com, Alibaba and Facebook.In a sector not typically known for large advances, health care fund Delaware Healthcare (DLHIX) put in a strong performance in 2017 with a 32.32% rise.The $512 million fund's performance was driven by its position in Germany-based MorphoSys — which advanced nearly 60% — and is involved in the development and research of antibodies. The foreign biotech is also the fund's biggest position as of the end of January at over 7%.Its top U.S.-based position is ethical drugmaker Eli Lilly (LLY), but that didn't spark the fund's 2017 performance, as the stock only rose about 15% last year.Retailers continue to struggle with the Amazon Effect, creating winners and losers within the sector. The obvious retail winner in 2017 was e-commerce giant Amazon.In 2017, Fidelity Select Retail (FSRPX) delivered a 25.82% return due to its long-term investment in the industry leader Amazon.A whopping 40% of the $2.3 billion fund's portfolio is tied to e-commerce giant Amazon (23%) and Home Depot (HD) (17%). Both stocks were paramount to the fund's return in 2017 and will again in 2018 if their positions remain that big.The Fidelity Select Retail fund has owned Amazon since August 2005 — according to Morningstar — while Home Depot was first purchased in August 2008. Last year, Amazon ran up 56%, accounting for a large portion of the fund's annual gains. The stock is trading near its highs and nearly 30% above its most recent buy point — a flat base's 1,213.51 entry.In the meantime, the home improvement retailer had a solid 41% advance in 2017. The retailer was driven higher by solid consumer spending and a strong housing cycle.

31,LLY,"Eli Lilly (LLY) issued strong 2018 guidance early Wednesday — following in the footsteps of AbbVie (ABBV) and Dow's Pfizer (PFE) — with an improved tax rate and earnings expectations after a fourth-quarter beat.X For 2018, Lilly called for an 18% tax rate, down from 20.5% in 2017. As a result, Lilly now sees adjusted income of $4.81-$4.91 per share, which would grow 12%-15% vs. 2017. Sales are expected to be $23 billion to $23.5 billion.Lilly cited U.S. tax legislation for the improved 2018 tax rate outlook. Adjusted earnings and sales guidance topped views for $4.65 and $23.19 billion, respectively.But Lilly stock dropped 5.4% to close at 81.45 on the stock market today. Collectively, drug stocks tumbled 2.2% a day after Amazon (AMZN), Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) pledged to cut down on U.S. health care costs.Evercore analyst Umer Raffat noted Lilly's animal health business disappointed. Sales of food animal products declined 8% to $547.4 million and widely missed expectations, he said in a report to clients.The miss stemmed from the U.S. where Lilly is facing competitive pressures for two products used in cattle: a milk supplement called Posilac and a nonsteroidal growth stimulant called Optaflexx.IBD'S TAKE: Lilly has an IBD Composite Rating of 80 out of a best-possible 99, meaning it outperforms eight in 10 stocks in terms of key growth metrics. Head to the IBD Stock Checkup for a look at other strong drug performers.Milk has been oversupplied in the market, depressing prices, Raffat said. Production has been strong and many customers are forgoing Posilac. Optaflexx is likely suffering from a rule under a U.S.-China export trade deal that the meat can't contain Optaflexx, he said.Outside animal health, there were very few misses, Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez said in a note to clients. Sales of plaque psoriasis drug Taltz, diabetes med Humulin and erectile dysfunction drug Cialis lagged the consensus.Still, total sales of $6.16 billion grew 7% year over year and beat the consensus for $5.96 billion.

"
32,LLY,"Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) has climbed 162% since hitting its 2017 low, but shares tumbled Wednesday after an analyst suggested their rise over the past nine months ""makes no sense.""X ""We believe the movement is a confluence of factors that have little to do with underlying factors, and have much more to do with perceptions surrounding liquidity/bankruptcy risk,"" Piper Jaffray analyst Christopher Raymond said in a note to clients.In short, the underlying dynamics mean Valeant is still in trouble, he said.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Valeant toppled 10.9% to finish at 19.88. Shares have been on a run since breaking out of a cup-with-handle base with a 15.84 buy point in late November. This month alone Valeant was up 7% as of Tuesday's close.Short interest now stands under 9% compared with a 2017 high of 16%, he said. That could be related the fact Valeant also has no long-term debt maturities in 2018 and 2019. But it has maturities of $2.7 billion, $3.2 billion and $5.3 billion in 2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively.""Liquidity risk is likely off the table for now,"" he said. ""That however does not mean that the dynamics surrounding the business have changed.""U.S. prescription volumes in Valeant's dermatology, brand eye care and legacy segments show declines of 30%, 15% and 12%, respectively, in 2017 vs. 2016, Raymond said. Each of these units is facing payer pressure and loss of exclusivities for key drugs.Further, it appears antibacterial Xifaxan is maturing, he said. Xifaxan is approved to treat traveler's diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea and hepatic encephalopathy, a condition that occurs in patients with liver dysfunction.IBD'S TAKE: Valeant has an IBD Composite Rating of 66 out of a best-possible 99, meaning it outperforms more than six in 10 stocks in terms of key growth metrics. But it still lags leaders like AbbVie with a CR of 98. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a look at other top-rated drug stocks.Xifaxan accounted for 13% of sales in the third quarter and is likely near 20% of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, Raymond said. That means its gross margins are likely in the 90% range.The pressure is on for Xifaxan, which is the most important revenue driver for Valeant, Raymond said. It requires only a small specialty salesforce to reach the gastroenterology community and hospital settings.""As such, this is the one topline driver that must continue to demonstrate a steady track record in order for anxiety regarding liquidity/bankruptcy risk not to reemerge,"" he said.But Xifaxan is also soon to face competition from Cosmo Pharmaceuticals' Aemcolo. Cosmo is aiming to file for approval of Aemcolo in traveler's diarrhea in the near-term and could enter the market before the end of the year.In new launches, Valeant is entering the glaucoma space with Vyzulta, which will rival Aerie Pharmaceuticals' (AERI) Rhopressa. Other players include Dow stock Pfizer (PFE), Allergan (AGN) and Novartis (NVS). Competition is likely to result in a wide spread between gross and net sales for Vyzulta.Valeant is also launching Siliq to treat plaque psoriasis. But physician feedback suggests the go-to treatments in that drug class will be Novartis' Cosentyx and Eli Lilly's (LLY) Taltz.""We do not believe these are opportunities that are significant enough to drive sustainable EBITDA growth,"" he said. ""Quite the contrary, we continue to believe that the loss of exclusivities and payer pressure will continue to be headwinds.""Raymond reiterated his underperform rating and 12 price target on Valeant.RELATED:Novartis Tops A High After Crushing Fourth-Quarter EarningsAbbott Spikes To Record After Topping Quarterly ExpectationsWhy These 3 Biotech Stocks Could Outperform Their Peers In 2018

33,LLY,"Alder Biopharmaceuticals (ALDR) could successfully compete with larger rivals Amgen (AMGN), Eli Lilly (LLY) and Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) in preventing chronic migraines, a pair of analysts said Tuesday.X The comments come in the wake of Alder's results last week of a Phase 3 trial in chronic migraines in which more than 60% of patients saw a reduction in days where they're afflicted with migraines. The company also said it resolved a patent dispute over its drug, eptinezumab, with Teva and found $250 million in equity financing.""Alder is turning things around in 2018,"" Needham analyst Danielle Brill said in a note to clients. She has a buy rating and a 26 price target on the stock.Despite the bullish note, Alder toppled 5.3% to close at 16.90 on the stock market today. Shares rocketed 36% over two days after Alder revealed the results of its Phase 3 eptinezumab trial on Jan. 8. The stock broke out of a cup formation at a 13.35 buy point on Jan. 3.Eptinezumab is being developed as an intravenous treatment to prevent chronic migraines. It belongs to a class of drugs called anti-CGRPs and competes against rival drugs from Amgen, Lilly and Teva.In the Phase 3 trial, 15% of patients treated with eptinezumab had no migraines for three months. A third of patients achieved a 75% or greater reduction in migraine days from baseline through month three, and 61% saw their migraine days cut in at least half over that time.""We believe the data also showcased intravenous eptinezumab's differentiated profile,"" Brill said. ""Rapidity of onset, and magnitude of benefit with intravenous eptinezumab were clearly distinguished from subcutaneous (injection) competitors' data.""IBD'S TAKE: Alder stock rose to an IBD Relative Strength Rating of 84 out of a best-possible 99 last week, though has since fallen to a 79. Visit IBD Data Stories for what goes into an RS Rating and what prompted Alder's spike.A specialist cited by Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan prefers the intravenous route for eptinezumab ""because it will lead to regular office visits by patients where he can monitor their progress and ensure proper compliance to therapy.""Alder is likely to be fourth to the market with an anti-CGRP, Divan said in a note to clients. Analysts had worried that would put Alder at a disadvantage to its larger rivals. But, like Needham's Brill, Divan sees eptinezumab as differentiated.Still, Alder and its rivals will face the same insurer obstacles and competition from likely less costly treatments like Allergan's (AGN) Botox, he said. In the U.S., about 40% of Botox sales come from use in chronic migraines.""Based on the cost of novel therapies, it is possible payers may push patients to try older (off-label) therapies as well as Botox before patients are given access to CGRP antibodies,"" Divan said. ""But over time we would assume new patients and patients who are not having satisfactory responses to Botox will move over to the CGRP antibodies.""Shares of Teva dove 3% to close at 21.41. Lilly dipped 1.9% to finish at 85.29. Amgen lost was up a fraction to close at 185.54.RELATED:Why Amgen Could Have An Edge Over These Rivals In Preventing MigrainesBiotechs Cruise On Upgrades, But Drugmakers Miss The BoatWhy This Biotech Suffered A 2-Day Headache On Rare-Disease Trial

34,LLY,"This year is shaping up to be boisterous for biotech acquisitions after Celgene (CELG) and Sanofi (SNY), in a matter of days, announced plans to spend north of $25 billion to take over three companies, analysts say.X Celgene and Sanofi, in particular, are facing challenges in areas where insurance companies are pushing back on payments in rheumatology and diabetes. That also leaves the likes of Novo Novartis (NVO) and Eli Lilly (LLY) in trouble, said Brad Loncar, who manages an immunotherapy-based fund.""These companies have to buy growth,"" Loncar told Investor's Business Daily. ""They've been growing their revenue doing artificial things whether that's drug price increases, tax inversions or some kind of other type of financial engineering. Those things are going away.""In all of 2017, there was $50 billion spent in biotech deals, Mizuho analyst Salim Syed told IBD. This year, so far Celgene has said it would spend $9 billion to buy the remainder of Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) it doesn't already own. Sanofi is spending $11.6 billion and $4.8 billion to acquire Bioverativ (BIVV) and Ablynx (ABLX).""For companies who haven't bought anything, it's just a matter of opportunity,"" Syed said.The buying spree kicked off in August when Gilead Sciences (GILD) announced its plan to acquire cancer play Kite Pharma for $11.9 billion. Gilead has been suffering from a major slowdown in hepatitis C drug sales amid high cure rates and saturation in the U.S. and Europe.Celgene and Sanofi announced their plans to acquire Juno and Bioverativ on the same day in January. Days later, Sanofi said it would buy rare disease drugmaker Ablynx.For Celgene, the acquisition followed a disappointing third quarter in which sales of psoriatic arthritis and plaque psoriasis drug Otezla widely missed expectations. The biotech also cut its 2020 guidance on Otezla's shortfall and after terminating several trials in Crohn's disease.Loncar described Celgene's long-term growth prospects at the time as a ""bleak picture."" It's also facing a patent cliff in the mid-2020s for its cancer drug Revlimid.IBD'S TAKE: It's challenging holding on to a stock amid a market correction as it declines. But that could help shares form a new potential base. Is it still possible to capture a big gain? Head to the Investor's Corner for four tips on how to make gains during a correction.""So they really couldn't afford to wait,"" he said.Sanofi, on the other hand, was skunked twice in 2016 and 2017 as it tried to acquire Medivation and Actelion Pharma. Dow component Pfizer (PFE) beat out Sanofi for Medivation and Dow's Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) was able to acquire Actelion out from under Sanofi.Roy Behren, a fund manager for Westchester Capital Management, says Sanofi committed a faux pas in both acquisitions — it made a hostile bid for Medivation and went back on an initially higher bid for Actelion, filings show.""Hostile approaches are generally unsuccessful in this space because of the fact the scientists are such an important part of the value equation,"" he told IBD. ""In the case of Sanofi and Medivation, they couldn't arrive at a price unless it was friendly. It was very difficult to complete the acquisition.""Among the high profile acquisitions in late 2017 and early 2018, the acquirers have suffered from pressure on sales of key moneymakers. That, along with tax reform allowing companies to pay less in corporate taxes and repatriate cash at a lower rate, could prime the pump for acquisitions.""I'm a strong believer this is going to be a huge year for acquisitions,"" Loncar said. ""No. 1, for larger companies, their growth is slowing, and No. 2, this tax reform deal adds fuel to that fire. It makes it easier for them to do these deals.""Novo Nordisk lost out on Ablynx to Sanofi. Now, Loncar expects Novo Nordisk to go after other assets to contend with its deep exposure to the diabetes market. Lilly, too, is seeing challenges in diabetes. Meanwhile, Amgen's (AMGN) older drugs are facing new competition.""All big companies really need to do this,"" he said.But there are outliers, Mizuho analyst Syed said. Biogen (BIIB), for instance, guided to flat 2018 sales for its multiple sclerosis unit, including the impact of a royalty it will get on revenue from Roche's (RHHBY) new drug Ocrevus.""There's this perception that the franchises are dwindling,"" he said. ""That's the argument that investors make for a lot of these guys like Biogen, like Amgen — that their base business is going away. That's not necessarily the case. Biogen is stable for 2018.""Still, flat sales won't be enough to pique investor interest. Biogen's aducanumab, a potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease, is a ""carrot"" for investors until clinical trial data is available toward the end of 2019 or early 2020.""But as long as that carrot is out there, it becomes really difficult for the hedge fund community to short the stock,"" he said. ""Aducanumab can produce returns — if it works — that large-cap biotechs typically don't see.""Westchester's Behren notes biotechs seem to be fairly interested in immunotherapies and oncology. That includes Gilead's acquisition of Kite and Celgene's plan to acquire Juno. Both are working on drugs known as CAR-T therapies, which teach the immune system to identify and fight cancer.""There has been a lot of activity in the oncology space in terms of immunotherapies,"" he said. ""The larger companies are trying to gobble up any promising technology they can while it's still affordable. We are also seeing quite a few testing companies being acquired.""Celgene's acquisition of Juno followed a common storyline, Behren said. Celgene invested in Juno in 2015 to create immunotherapies in cancer and autoimmune diseases. The duo is furthest along with JCAR017, a potential treatment for non-Hodgkin lymphoma.When Celgene pulled the trigger on Juno on Jan. 22, it made sense that it was at a 28% premium to Juno's closing price on the prior trading day.""Biotechs — even more than high tech — tend to come at significant premiums to trading prices,"" he said. ""That's because they're somewhat risky, but could be a huge payoff in the event they're successful.""Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) could be amid a similar plot. In September 2016, the duo paired up to test Nektar's drug called NKTR-214 with Bristol's Opdivo in patients with melanoma, kidney cancer and lung cancer. In November, Nektar presented strong early data from the combos.Loncar pegged Nektar as a potential takeover target in 2018, calling NKTR-214 ""revolutionary."" Days later, Bristol announced it would pay Nektar $1.85 billion upfront — comprised of $1 billion in cash and the purchase of 2.28 million shares — to test NKTR-214 with Opdivo and Opdivo plus Yervoy.The deal allows Bristol to remain the leader in immuno-oncology/immuno-oncology combinations without risking a $16 billion bid on Nektar, Evercore analyst Umer Raffat said in a Feb. 14 note to clients.""I have no doubt (Nektar's) phone has been ringing off the hook since (November) because their data was so interesting,"" Loncar said. ""If someone is bold enough to buy them, it could put the acquirer into a class of their own in immuno-oncology.""Drugs called PARP inhibitors also look interesting, Loncar said. Clovis Oncology (CLVS) and Tesaro (TSRO) both have drugs approved in this class and are small enough to acquire. AstraZeneca (AZN) also works in that space.Sarepta Therapeutics (SRPT), Neurocrine Biosciences (NBIX) and BioMarin Pharmaceutical (BMRN) have also had successful launches recently.""If a company wants revenue growth, buy a rare-disease drug,"" he said. ""They have the best sales ramps. I think those types of companies are really interesting right now. I wouldn't be surprised if some of them get bought out.""RELATED:Biotech Investors Flee In Droves As Market Correction Rocks The GroupThese Biotechs Could Spring Back After Market Correction: AnalystWhy These 3 Biotech Stocks Could Outperform Their Peers In 2018

35,LLY,"Celgene (CELG), Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) and Incyte (INCY) are worth watching amid a broader market correction that saw biotech stocks lose a collective 8% over the previous five days, an analyst said Tuesday.X Biotech stocks rebounded 1.9% on the stock market today, after diving 3.5% on Monday.BMO Capital Markets analyst Brian Belski said in a note to clients that investors are reaping what they sowed.""For all intents and purposes, the majority of clients, market pundits and especially an increasingly boisterous set of naysayers, have been predicting the bull market's imminent demise since the day after the 2016 U.S. presidential election,"" he said.But that doesn't mean the bull market is dead, Belski said. RBC analyst Brian Abrahams agreed — and sees some ""opportune entry points"" for certain biotechs stocks with data and/or approvals expected in 2018.Things are looking up for Celgene after a few missteps in the second half of 2017 — including a major miss in sales of psoriatic arthritis drug Otezla in the third quarter, Abrahams said. Sales of that drug rebounded in the fourth quarter.""We believe the market cap reduction more than reflected that, and we believe their fourth-quarter numbers and 2018 guidance point to reassuring stabilization of key U.S. Revlimid and Otezla sales,"" he said.IBD'S TAKE: A bull market is a good time review your stock-selling smarts because once it begins to stall out of an uptrend, it's too late to catch up. Head to the Investor's Corner to brush up on stock-selling rules.Cancer drug Revlimid is Celgene's biggest drug. Analysts have worried about generic rivals taking sales starting in 2022. To contend with that, Celgene recently announced its plan to acquire the remainder of Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) it didn't already own.Adding Juno to its coffers puts Celgene in the CAR-T space where it will compete against Novartis (NVS) and Gilead Sciences (GILD) — the latter via its acquisition of Kite Pharma. CAR-T therapies teach the immune system to identify and fight cancer.But even without Juno, Celgene looks poised to generate enough cash flow to buy back virtually its entire enterprise value before Revlimid goes completely generic in 2026, Abrahams said.Outside that, Abrahams sees a number of 2018 catalysts including additional data for Revlimid in treating lymphoma and late-stage data for drug luspatercept, with partner Acceleron Pharma (XLRN), in blood disorders.Celgene rose 2.7% to 96.25 on Tuesday.Abrahams says Vertex was ""a victim of bad timing."" Vertex recently reported strong data for its triple-combination regimens in cystic fibrosis. But the data came out just as the broader markets were beginning to turn and the stock fell hard the past two days. But Vertex rebounded Tuesday, rising 2.7% to 159.27.Strong effectiveness from drugs known as VX-659 and VX-445 in two triple regimens heading into Phase 3 studies support the likelihood that Vertex can expand into a tough-to-treat population of cystic fibrosis patients, he said.It also enables ""multiple additional shots on goal and sets a bar that will be difficult to match or beat — and with significant lead time — likely rendering mid-year competitive data from Galapagos (GLPG) (an overhang on Vertex shares) much less impactful.""He raised his price target on Vertex to 200. The macro weakness is masking improved fundamentals, Abrahams argued.Incyte is set to read out data from a Phase 3 trial known as Echo-301 in the first half of 2018. The study combined Incyte's immuno-oncology drug epacadostat with Dow stock Merck's (MRK) Keytruda in late-stage melanoma.Both drugs belong to a class known as immuno-oncology treatments. Epacadostat works to block interactions involving the IDO enzyme in the immune system. Keytruda is called a PD-1 inhibitor, which has a similar interaction with the PD-L1 protein.Instinet analyst Christopher Marai expects the trial will read out positively and could be similar to a regimen of Bristol-Myers Squibb's (BMY) drugs Opdivo and Yervoy. Bristol is also combining these drugs to treat other cancers, including advanced lung cancer.If so, ""epacadostat could become part of the standard of care in metastatic melanoma with broad adoption augmenting current anti-PD-1 use,"" he said in a note to clients. That could lead to peak worldwide sales north of $1 billion in melanoma alone for epacadostat.But RBC's Abrahams says eventually nearly all the value for epacadostat will soon be gone from Incyte's shares. He sees $65 per share for Jakafi, which treats a bone marrow disorder, and $8 per share for Olumiant, a rheumatoid arthritis drug co-developed with Eli Lilly (LLY).This ""suggests downside if upcoming epacadostat data are negative is now likely only about $10 per share, with fundamental upside now potentially more than 50%,"" he said. This ""makes the upside/downside at these levels that much more interesting.""Incyte advanced 3.3% to 88.11 on Tuesday.RELATED:Allergan Pops On Consensus-Topping Quarter, Strong Migraine TrialThese Biotech Stocks Each Dived More Than 20% — Is The Sell-Off Overdone?Can CRISPR And These 3 Small Biotechs Cure 10,000 Diseases?

36,LLY,"The S&P 500 index and other major averages had their first down week of 2018, and it was their worst showing in two years. Apple (AAPL) guided lower, as many suspected. Amazon (AMZN) and Boeing (BA) delivered strong results while Facebook (FB) touted strong ad rates. Alibaba (BABA) missed on earnings. PayPal (PYPL) crashed as former parent eBay (EBAY) moved to cut ties. A move by Amazon, JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) to team up to tackle health care costs hit insurers and pharmacy benefit managers. The Bitcoin meltdown continuedX After a hot start to 2018, the major averages suffered their worst weekly losses in two years, with the S&P 500 down 3.9%, the Dow 4.1% and the Nasdaq 3.5% as rising bond yields worldwide pressured stocks. UnitedHealth (UNH), CVS Health (CVS) and many other insurers fell on an Amazon-JPMorgan-Berkshire health care joint venture. Amazon, Boeing and Facebook were earnings winners, Alibaba was a notable loser, while Apple (AAPL) did OK.Bitcoin plummeted below $8,000 as 2018 losses accelerate as Facebook joined a chorus of regulators worldwide cracking down on cryptocurrencies.Apple (AAPL) earnings per share rose 16% year over year, on sales of $88.3 billion, up 13%, for the fiscal first quarter. Both narrowly beat expectations. Apple sold 77.3 million iPhones vs. the consensus for 80 million units, but average selling prices due to its new iPhone X and iPhone 8 models fueled overall results. For the March quarter, Apple expects sales of $61 billion, based on the midpoint of guidance, below official estimates for $65.4 billion. Shares fell 4.3% on Friday to a new three-month low.The e-commerce leader reported adjusted earnings of $3.75 a share, smashing the consensus of $1.85. A big benefit from tax cuts helped. Revenue rose 38% to $60.5 billion, also beating. Revenue from Amazon Web Services rose 46% to $5.1 billion. Sales of its Echo line of smart speakers far exceed expectations, Amazon (AMZN) said. Shares gained 3%, hitting a new high intraday.Facebook (FB) reported robust earnings and revenue growth that topped Q4 forecasts. User growth cooled while users' time spent on Facebook fell, even before its latest big News Feed changes. But executives said on the conference call that ad rates are soaring, easing analysts' revenue fears. Shares hit a record high Thursday.Alphabet (GOOGL) shares fell after the Google parent reported Q4 adjusted earnings were $9.70 a share, up 28% from a year earlier, missing views. Traffic acquisition costs, what Google pays partner websites to carry ads, soared 33% to $6.45 billion. Google expects the rise in TAC to moderate after Q1. Google's rising TAC has been linked to a contract renewal with Apple as well as internet searches shifting to mobile phones. Revenue rose 24% to $32.32 billion, topping consensus. The adjusted EPS excluded the impact of tax reform, which resulted in additional expense of $9.9 billion.Amazon's Jeff Bezos, JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon and Berkshire's Warren Buffett said the new nonprofit company is aimed at reducing costs for their employees. But if they are successful with their own firms, the thinking is that they would expand the services to corporate America. Health insurers and pharmacy benefit managers sold off. UnitedHealth, the largest U.S. health insurer and also a PBM, sank 6.7%. Drugstore-and-PBM CVS Health (CVS), which is buying insurer Aetna (AET), lost 6.8%. Pure-play PBM Express Scripts (ESRX) retreated 5.9%.PayPal (PYPL) reported strong earnings and in-line guidance, while former parent eBay (EBAY) reported in-line Q4 earnings but stronger-than-expected gross merchandise volume. But the real news was that eBay stunned Wall Street with the news that it will replace PayPal in 2020 and handle payments on its own site via a partnership with Adyen. The move will add a revenue stream. Shares of eBay soared nearly 14% on Thursday. PayPal lost 10.4% for the week, closing below a buy point and its 50-day line.The Chinese e-commerce giant's revenue soared 56% to $12.8 billion, the best gain in at least 15 quarters and beating views. Earnings per U.S. share climbed 25%, but slightly missed forecasts. Alibaba will buy a 33% stake in Ant Financial, a former unit that runs payments service Alipay. That replaces a deal in which Alibaba got 37.5% of Ant Financial's pretax profit. Alibaba will provide some intellectual property but not cash. The move clears hurdles for a possible Ant Financial IPO. Alibaba shares 8.7% for the week, tumbling below a recent buy point.The U.S. added 200,000 jobs in January, better than expected. Average hourly wages surged 2.9% vs. a year earlier, far above views and the best since 2009. The ISM manufacturing index continued to point to raid employment gains. While fast growth and wage gains are good news, they could spur the Federal Reserve to raise rates more aggressively this year.The software leader reported adjusted earnings per share of 96 cents, up 20% year over year, on sales of $28.9 billion, up 12%, for its fiscal second quarter. Analysts expected 86 cents and $28.4 billion. Microsoft got a lift from its cloud computing businesses, including Azure, Office 365 and Dynamics. For the current quarter, Microsoft guided to earnings per share of 83 cents on sales of $25.6 billion, above views. Shares hit a record high intraday Thursday.AMD (AMD), Broadcom (AVGO) and Qorvo (QRVO) offered investors positive financial news. AMD beat Wall Street's targets for the December quarter and guided estimates higher for the current quarter. Broadcom gave preliminary sales and earnings guidance for its fiscal first quarter that topped views. Qorvo rocketed after disclosing a big contract win with major customer Apple (AAPL) for its next-generation iPhone. Qorvo delivered better-than-expected results for its fiscal Q3, but guided well below Wall Street's targets for the current quarter.Boeing (BA) reported EPS of $4.80 a share, or $3.06 excluding a $1.74 per-share benefit from tax cuts. Either way, Boeing beat analyst views for $2.91. Revenue climbed 9% to $25.37 billion, also topping views. Boeing also guided 2018 EPS and revenue forecasts higher. Tax cuts will spur more investment and makes the case for new midmarket jet more compelling. Boeing also got a $6.6 billion missile defense contract from the Pentagon. UPS (UPS) ordered 14 new 747 jets, giving the venerable jumbo jet a new lifeline. Meanwhile, Lockheed Martin (LMT) EPS jumped 32% to $4.30 while revenue rose 10% to $15.1 billion. The defense giant guided 2018 EPS views higher.Boeing shares rose 1.7% this week and Lockheed 2.25%, both hitting new highs.Video game publisher Electronic Arts (EA) saw its stock surge to a record high after reporting big gains in online services associated with its sports game franchises FIFA and Madden NFL. The boost in Live Services was revealed as part of EA's in-line December-quarter earnings report. Video game hardware and software firm Nintendo (NTDOY) posted better-than-expected December-quarter results thanks to the continued success of its Switch console and related software. Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) announced a major delay to its highly anticipated Wild West action game ""Red Dead Redemption 2,"" now set for release on Oct. 26 instead of this spring.Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA) topped analyst forecasts, as people broke out the plastic more often to spend during the holidays. Visa also OK'd a $7.5 billion buyback. That follows American Express (AXP), which just suspended its buyback. Visa also hiked its quarterly cash dividend to 21 cents a share.Homebuilder stocks continued to struggle even as some big builders reported better-than-expected earnings after the prior week's surprise miss by NVR (NVR). Housing demand and prices are strong, but concerns are growing over rising labor and material costs. Mortgage rates, though low, are rising. America's largest homebuilder D.R. Horton (DHI) beat on both EPS and revenue Wednesday, but shares met resistance at their 50-day line. PulteGroup (PHM) stock kept falling on sliding gross margins, even though earnings and sales topped views. Smaller Meritage Homes (MTH) also beat while smaller M/I Homes (MHO)  and M.D.C. Holdings (MDC) missed on EPS.A slew of biotechs and drugmakers reported earnings, including Pfizer (PFE), Eli Lilly (LLY), Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), AstraZeneca (AZN) and Merck (MRK), all of which topped Wall Street's fourth-quarter earnings expectations. Pfizer came in with $13.7 billion in sales and adjusted profit of 62 cents per share. Lilly's total sales grew 7% to $6.16 billion and the firm brought in adjusted income of $1.14 per share. Vertex reported sales of $651.6 million and adjusted profit of 61 cents per share. AstraZeneca reported core earnings of $1.30 per share and $5.78 billion in sales. Merck's results were mixed with $10.43 billion on the top line missing views, but adjusted income of 98 cents per share beat by 4 cents. Amgen (AMGN) reported $5.8 billion in sales and adjusted earnings of $2.89 per share, lagging the consensus. In merger news, Sanofi (SNY) announced it would acquire Ablynx (ABLX) for $4.8 billion.Exxon Mobil (XOM) fell well short of consensus while fellow Dow industrials component Chevron (CVX) also missed EPS views. Both shares plunged below their 50-day lines, with Chevron undercutting a recent buy point. Separately, U.S. crude production continues to hit fresh longtime highs, while crude supplies rose for the first time in 11 weeks. Crude futures remain near three-year highs.Ferrari (RACE) gapped into a buy zone after reporting strong earnings Thursday. Meanwhile, U.S. auto sales slumped in January, with big declines from Ford (F) and Fiat Chrysler (FCAU). GM (GM) sales edged higher, but missed views. Toyota (TM) sales skyrocketed on strong truck sales.

37,LLY,"Stock fought to a positive finish on Wednesday, as health care and construction stocks booked some of the day's widest losses, while video-game stocks notched a bevy of breakouts.X The Dow Jones industrial average led, ending up 0.3%, boosted by Boeing's (BA) monster 5% advance, on the heels of its glowing Q4 results. The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.1%, while the S&P 500 struggled to a fractional gain.Markets dropped sharply after the Fed's 2 p.m. ET announcement. The committee held its target interest rate unchanged, but offered a slightly more wary tone on inflation. The day's other economic news was positive, with early data from ADP showing January hiring slipped less than expected, while December pending home sales and a Chicago-region manufacturing for January gauge easily topped expectations.The Dow was held back some by medical components Merck (MRK), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Pfizer (PFE), which all dropped more than 2%. Drugmaker Eli Lilly (LLY) tumbled 5%, following a generally positive fourth-quarter report. But drug sector investors were apparently still reacting to Tuesday's news of an innovative health care partnership between Amazon.com (AMZN), Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA) and JPMorgan (JPM).Amazon advanced 1.5%, putting it 20% past its 1213.10 buy point and in a profit-taking zone. The other three FANG stock tech leaders lost ground. Netflix (NFLX) fell furthest, down nearly 3%, but still extended after its early January breakout.Tesla (TSLA) rose 2.5% in average trade, for its third gain in four sessions. Shares are now up more than 20% from their November low and back above support at their 10- and 40-week moving averages, climbing the right side of a possible four-month base pattern.The video game trade was among the day's winners, with Ninetendo (NTDOY), Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) and Electronic Arts (EA) all clearing buy points or adding to entries. Ninetendo trimmed gains in afternoon trade, but remained just beyond buy range above a cup-base buy point at 54.06. Electronic Arts pared its advance and held in its buy range, after topping a 122.89 buy point, also from a cup base.Take-Two chalked up a 7% surge to end at the very top of a buy range above a 120.72 cup base buy point.Concrete and aggregates suppliers took the session's worst performance among industries, with U.S. Concrete (USCR) tumbling more than 6%, Eagle Materials (EXP) down 5% and Martin Marietta (MLM) and Vulcan Materials (VMC) falling 3% apiece. Eagle materials posted a mixed fourth quarter report before the open, but the reaction could also have been linked to public-private infrastructure cost-sharing questions raised in President Trump's State Of The Union address.Among IBD 50 names, telecom software developer Casa Systems (CASA) gained more than 6% in soft trade.

41,LLY,"European pharmaceutical firms AstraZeneca (AZN) and Novo Nordisk (NVO) pulled upgrades on Friday as analysts looked ahead to key 2018 clinical trial readouts in ovarian cancer and diabetes, respectively.X AstraZeneca rose 1.7% to 34.70 on the stock market today, while Novo Nordisk dipped a fraction to 53.67. JPMorgan analyst James Gordon upgraded AstraZeneca to an overweight rating. JPM's Richard Vosser boosted Novo Nordisk to a neutral rating.AstraZeneca's medium-term growth outlook is twice the European pharma sector, Gordon wrote in a note to clients. In 2018, he expects a return to topline growth with new launches being key, and he sees core earnings hitting a floor before rising in 2019.Gordon was bearish this year on a clinical trial testing a combination of immuno-oncology drugs in advanced lung cancer. In July, AstraZeneca said the regimen didn't shrink tumors. It had pinned its hopes on the trial, dubbed Mystic, and immuno-oncology in general.Now, the Mystic trial is continuing with a goal of improving overall survival, or OS.""Our bear key points in 2017 were an expectation for Mystic PFS (progression-free survival) failure and overly high base business and divestment expectations,"" he said. ""With Mystic PFS having failed and low expectations for the OS readout, we now see only modest downside.""AstraZeneca is also set to have data from a trial of its drug, Lynparza, as a first treatment for a form of ovarian cancer. There, it rivals Clovis Oncology (CLVS) and Tesaro (TSRO), but Gordon sees a high likelihood AstraZeneca will be successful in the trial is calls Solo-1.IBD'S TAKE: Large-cap biotechs and drugmakers suffered mounting competition in 2017 from newer therapies and generic rivalries. That theme is likely to continue into 2018, analysts say. Head to IBD Industry Themes for a closer look at what that trend could mean for bigger players.For 2019-'22, Gordon forecasts AstraZeneca achieving a 13% compound annual growth rate in core earnings per share, more than twice the sector at 6%. The market will likely focus on five key product launches in 2018, which could beat consensus views by 8% in aggregate, he said.Among those, he expects sales of lung cancer drug Tagrisso to top expectations by 26% in the U.S. in 2018. His 2022 forecast of $1.9 billion in U.S. sales could be achievable if just half of 15,000 patients with a specific mutation receive the therapy as a first treatment.""Based on much higher penetrations of comparable therapies, and with no competitors on the horizon, we think even our own forecast could prove conservative,"" he said.Outside the U.S, he assumes 50% price cuts in Europe and Japan for patients who receive the drug as a first treatment. In China, he expects 20% of eligible patients to receive Tagrisso and assumes a similar price cut.Gordon expects sales of immuno-oncology drug Imfinzi to be in line and sees Lynparza, which treats ovarian cancer, to post a small beat in 2018-'19. But he sees downside in the long-term for both drugs.AstraZeneca is also launching Calquence as a treatment for mantle cell lymphoma but with only 2,000 patients in the U.S. he sees near-term downside. AstraZeneca is also looking at the drug in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, which affects a larger group of patients.Fasenra was also recently approved as a bi-monthly treatment for a form of asthma. But the drug rivals GlaxoSmithKline's (GSK) Nucala, which is administered monthly. In 2019, it's likely Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' (REGN) and Sanofi's (SNY) Dupixent will get approval to treat asthma.For Novo Nordisk, 2018 will be a story of oral semaglutide, Vosser said. Oral semaglutide is being investigated in Phase 3 trials dubbed Pioneer as a treatment for type 2 diabetes. Oral semaglutide belongs to a class of drugs known as GLP-1 receptor agonists.Currently, GLP-1 drugs are only available as injections. Novo Nordisk looks to be the first to market with an oral GLP-1. Oramed Pharmaceuticals (ORMP) is also working on an oral GLP-1 drug, but it's far behind Novo Nordisk.""Given we see the oral semaglutide data living up to expectations, we don't see the Pioneer program being a source of disappointment to investors in 2018 and see the market leaving the more difficult commercial questions around the product until after the clinical profile is nailed down by the clinical trial results,"" Vosser said in a note to clients.Novo Nordisk is testing oral semaglutide vs. its own Victoza, Dow stock Merck's (MRK) Januvia and Eli Lilly's (LLY) Jardiance in a series of trials.RELATED:Why Clovis' Good News In Ovarian Cancer Prodded These Rivals DownTesaro Takes A Swipe At AstraZeneca's Ovarian Cancer Drug SalesWhy Tesaro's $2 Million Cancer-Drug Miss Prompted Its Rivals To Topple

42,LLY,"No. 1 biotech Amgen (AMGN) could have an edge in the preventative migraine space where it competes against Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA), Eli Lilly (LLY) and Alder Biopharmaceuticals (ALDR), an analyst said Thursday.X Late Wednesday, the New England Journal of Medicine published safety data for drugs known as anti-CGRPs from Amgen and Teva. These drugs aim to inhibit a neuropeptide that has long been associated with migraine pain. Shares of Amgen closed 2% higher Thursday to 175.66.RBC analyst Kennen MacKay expects Amgen to take 20% of the U.S. anti-CGRP migraine market which he values at a total $5 billion opportunity. Amgen's drug, known as erenumab, has a cleaner safety profile differentiating it.""Efficacy data in the publications was previously known, though new safety data from Amgen's episodic and Teva's chronic migraine trials suggested safety could become a more differentiating factor as additional data is fully presented,"" he said.Liver toxicity remained clean in Amgen's trial with partner Novartis (NVS). Teva's drug, dubbed fremanezumab, resulted in slight liver test imbalances which could be explained by other medicines taken by patients.Amgen saw injection site reactions in 0%-3% of patients. Teva reported reactions in 20%-30% of patients who received either the drug or a placebo. This could be due to Teva's requirement for multiple injections, higher injection volume and/or needle size.Between the four, Amgen will have first-mover advantage with a potential approval date in May. Teva is using a priority review voucher for a potential approval date in June. Lilly is expected to enter the market in the second half of 2018 with Alder following.IBD'S TAKE: Biotech behemoths struggled during the third quarter, leaving room for small-caps to swipe headlines with their Street-crushing metrics. Head to the Industry Snapshot for a breakdown on how the third quarter played out in the group.Payors could block reimbursement for some patients beginning and continuing anti-CGRP therapy, MacKay said. Though he notes Amgen has extensive experience in negotiating with payors, ""making them highly competitive with this dynamic.""Drugs known as triptans are considered reasonable first-treatment options for acute migraines. Still, past payor policies favored sumatriptan, the first agent in the class to go generic, despite the existence of more effective, but costly, branded drugs.""These pricier though more efficacious agents were relegated to patients who were contraindicated for, or had recently failed sumatriptan,"" MacKay said. ""Payors could require continued proof of benefit for continued reimbursement (of anti-CGRPs).""MacKay models 30 million patients in the U.S. suffer from migraines including 2.3 million with chronic migraines and 2.4 million with episodic migraines and five to 14 headaches per month.""Of these, we estimate 35% (2 million patients) are seen by specialists and could classify for CGRP therapy,"" he said. ""Ultimately, we view the CGRP class penetrating into 25% (500,000 patients) of this U.S. market.""RELATED:Why The Medicines Co.

43,LLY,"Roche (RHHBY) is now a ""real competitor"" with a potential first treatment in advanced lung cancer, an analyst said Monday after the drugmaker's immuno-oncology regimen hit its goals in a Phase 3 trial.XIn early trading on the stock market today, Roche jumped 5.9% to close at 30.82, running up to its highest point since mid-October. Meanwhile, shares of Dow component Merck (MRK), which has a rival combination, dropped 2% to finish at 54.10.Top-line data show Roche's Tecentriq combined with cancer drug Avastin and chemotherapy provided a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in the risk of disease worsening or death compared with a regimen of Avastin plus chemo.Further details will be provided during an upcoming medical conference in December, Roche said. Overall survival data aren't mature yet, but are encouraging and expected in the first half of 2018, the firm said.The results are a mixed bag for Merck. Merck received accelerated approval in May to use its immuno-oncology drug Keytruda with chemo to treat advanced lung cancer.Keytruda and Tecentriq are both immuno-oncology drugs, respectively, a PD-1 inhibitor and a PD-L1 inhibitor. Evidence has suggested these drugs could work better in a population of patients whose bodies make more of a protein called PD-L1.In October, Merck pulled its application for its regimen in Europe and delayed a key study of the combination. This move led analysts to question whether there's an ongoing issue with the regimen. Merck stock dipped to a 17-month low on the worries.IBD'S TAKE: Big biotech players struggled during the third quarter, but smaller caps enjoyed major sales beats led by Exelixis (EXEL) and Neurocrine Biosciences (NBIX), which topped views by $48.5 million and nearly $36 million, respectively. Read the Industry Snapshot for a deeper dive on the third quarter.But Roche's trial helps to confirm the theory that an immuno-oncology plus chemo regimen can succeed in a broad population of patients with advanced lung cancer, regardless how much of that protein their bodies make, Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez said.It's not clear whether Avastin has any real benefit on the combination, Fernandez wrote in a note to clients. Avastin is approved as a first treatment in a form of advanced lung cancer, but isn't widely used and isn't well tolerated, he said.Avastin-based regimens are used as first treatments in an estimated 10%-20% of lung cancer patients vs. Eli Lilly's (LLY) drug Alimta, which is used in 50%-60%, he said. Merck discontinued pursuit of an Avastin-based regimen on safety concerns and, instead, gained approval with Lilly's drug.""To us, this result is more a validation of the benefits of immuno-oncology plus chemo combinations and is most positive for Roche given Tecentriq's position in our model as the third or perhaps even fourth player in the PD-1/PD-L1 market by sales,"" he said.Evercore analyst Umer Raffat agreed, noting the news solidifies Roche's regimen as a ""real competitor"" in treating advanced lung cancer.RELATED:This Biotech Just Neared A 17-Year High On Strong Cancer RegimenHow These Rivals Could Take A Chunk Of Medtronic's Heart-Unit SalesBiotechs Sell Off In Droves — Are Investors Seeking Mergers?

44,LLY,"No franchise is safe in 2018 among large-cap biotechs, which are feeling pressure as the Food and Drug Administration speeds approvals for rival branded and generic medicines, analysts said Monday.X The theme is a continuation from 2017, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said in a note to clients.""Despite the near-record number of drug approvals, the large-cap biopharmaceutical sector fell out of a favor with investors, with no names more punished than those with concentrated product portfolios and looming branded or generic competitors,"" he said.Heading into 2018, management confidence is low as revenue trajectories for high-profile products face a slowdown courtesy of payers and competitive pressures. Porges doesn't see the uncertainty lifting in 2018 — and ""possibly not ever.""In 2017, competitive pressures slugged the likes of Celgene (CELG) and Gilead Sciences (GILD). Celgene is feeling the pain in its inflammation unit amid mounting competition from Eli Lilly (LLY) and Novartis (NVS), as Gilead sees a rival for its hepatitis C drug sales in AbbVie (ABBV).Early next year, Porges expects guidance from the lion's share of large-cap biotechs to be conservative. The most stock-moving guidance will come from Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) and Gilead, he predicted.Alexion is working on a drug dubbed ALXN1210 to treat a pair of rare blood diseases. It's also undergoing a restructuring. Meanwhile, Gilead's hepatitis C franchise will again come under the microscope even as it attempts to pivot further into HIV with its drug bictegravir.""We believe there is $16 per share of value in Gilead's stock for hepatitis C, and the stock price could move up or down 5% if hepatitis C revenue guidance meaningfully differs from the consensus $5.5 billion to $6 billion estimate,"" Porges said.IBD'S TAKE: Small-cap biotechs performed well in the third quarter, but large-caps suffered mounting competitive concerns. See how that translated in the stock prices by visiting the Industry Snapshot.He noted AbbVie's plans for hepatitis C products are likely to hurt Gilead stock. AbbVie recently launched Mavyret to treat all six genotypes of hepatitis C. AbbVie will likely provide guidance on its fourth-quarter call ahead of Gilead.Porges expects 2018 sales outlooks from Celgene, Alexion, Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), Gilead, Amgen (AMGN) and AbbVie to miss analyst estimates. Biogen (BIIB) could provide an outlook that encompasses analyst views, he said.Later in the year, the large-cap universe will face political pressure, Porges predicted.""By midyear the congressional midterm elections will be underway, and these campaigns are likely to renew the focus on pharmaceutical companies and their pricing policies,"" he said. ""We continue to favor stocks of companies that are structural demand growth stories, with products protected by commercial, scientific, clinical or legal barriers to entry.""For 2018, his top picks are Vertex and Alexion.Another Leerink analyst, Michael Schmidt, pegs Clovis Oncology (CLVS) and Puma Biotechnology (PBYI) as his top picks among small- and midsize biotechs focused on treating cancer.This group of stocks has outperformed the broader biotech market by 52% thus far in 2017, Schmidt wrote in a note to clients. This dynamic is set to continue in 2018 in a ""favorable regulatory environment"" and as large caps expand their portfolios via acquisitions.In 2018, Incyte (INCY), Seattle Generics (SGEN), Exelixis (EXEL), Clovis, Agios Pharmaceuticals (AGIO), Puma and Array Biopharma (ARRY) are set to launch key products. He counts nine in the group set to unveil pivotal trial results and pending regulatory decisions for a total of seven firms.Emerging technologies remain of interest. CAR-T therapy, which trains a patient's immune cells to fight cancer, and precision oncology had a strong 2017. But success in immuno-oncology combinations, cancer vaccines and certain antibodies has only been modest.""We think next-generation antibody-drug conjugates could be an underappreciated re-emerging area of interest in 2018, representing a clinically validated category but with significant room for upside,"" Schmidt said.Antibody-drug conjugates are antibodies linked to cell-killing agents. The antibody binds to specific marks at the surface of a cancer cell. ImmunoGen (IMGN), Mersana Therapeutics (MRSN) and Seattle are working in this area with the latter the furthest along, he said.RELATED:Why Big Pharma And Biotech Companies Are Girding For A Pricing 'Knife Fight'Teva's Restructuring Plan: Another Case Of Been Here, Done That?Generic Drug Makers Face Pricing Issues That Other Pharmas Don't
"
45,LLY,"Invest in the disruptors.That's the advice from Wall Street, as giant biotech companies and the incumbents of Big Pharma are bracing to get crushed by more innovative — and cheaper — new drugs.X What started in 2017 will continue in 2018, analysts say. Generic drug approvals are rising and interesting new medicines are starting to take market share from the legacy makers of medications that consumers use frequently, including both Big Pharma and biotech companies.Blockbuster drugs representing an estimated $17 billion in annual sales are set to lose patent protection over the next decade, analysts say. Disruption will come as generic drugs and innovative new biologic alternatives come on the market.""It will be brutal,"" JMP Securities analyst Mike King told Investor's Business Daily. ""It will be a knife fight.""In the market for cholesterol-lowering drugs, King expects Amgen (AMGN), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Sanofi (SNY) to feel the heat from the likes of Esperion Therapeutics (ESPR), The Medicines Co. (MDCO) and Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (ALNY).Meanwhile, in anti-inflammatory treatments, Celgene's (CELG) Otezla, which gained blockbuster status in 2016, missed sales forecasts by a wide cut in the third quarter. Analysts say newly approved drugs to treat the same conditions from Eli Lilly (LLY) and Novartis (NVS) are taking market share.Gilead Sciences (GILD) is still feeling the pain from the maturing of its hepatitis C drug unit in the U.S. and Europe. The rapid pace of Gilead's hepatitis C sales decline is expected to slow down somewhat, but newer medicines like AbbVie's (ABBV) Mavyret are likely to swipe some of its sales.Big Pharma isn't getting any help from regulators either. Food and Drug Administration head Scott Gottlieb will continue to increase approvals for copycat drugs, stoking competition for both branded and generic drugs facing new rivals as firms try to undercut one another in price.Among the Big Pharma companies, Pfizer (PFE) will be at the forefront feeling the sting of generics taking sales. Earlier this month, Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) was allowed to launch a generic copy of the blockbuster erectile dysfunction drug Viagra.Generic drugs tend to be cheaper than their branded counterparts and Viagra is a pricey drug at about $70 per tablet, according to AccessRX. In 2013, after Pfizer lost exclusivity for Viagra in Canada and Europe, worldwide sales fell 8% to $1.88 billion.Today, generics in Europe have slashed the price of drugs containing the same active ingredient as Viagra by about 90%. Generic versions of Viagra cost about a third of the price in Canada. U.S. Viagra prices could also fall if the trend repeats itself with a generic on the market.Teva, meanwhile, is struggling with $34.7 billion in debt as of the end of the third quarter. On Thursday, Teva announced a plan to cut its workforce by more than a quarter, close several manufacturing facilities and suspend its dividend on ordinary shares.The firm is also planning to review its generic drug portfolio, most specifically in the U.S., to change prices or discontinue products.IBD'S TAKE: See how giant biotechs fared vs. smaller players in the third quarter by visiting the Industry Snapshot. Hint: The quarter was classified as ""alarming"" for one large-cap biotech which could be in trouble as they see more competition for their traditional moneymakers.Across the board, spending on prescription drugs in 2016 increased by just 3.8% per person, according to a report from Express Scripts (ESRX). That's down from a 5.2% rise in 2015, representing a 27% drop in the growth rate.That trend is likely to continue in 2018, FBB Capital Partners analyst Mike Bailey told IBD. He credits Gottlieb for the decline in generic prices. Gottlieb is running the FDA like a business, which allows for a cycle of more approvals, more competition and lower prices.Although the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services could use their tools to influence pricing, it's unlikely President Trump will use his executive powers to enact sweeping drug-pricing reform such as allowing Medicare to negotiate prices or enacting outright pricing controls, Bailey says.""I wouldn't expect any major changes out of the Trump administration in pricing,"" he said. ""I think mechanically and politically it's difficult to get pricing law through the system. It's politically more acceptable to just get more generic drug approvals. It's a win-win.""JMP's King counts drugs that treat rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis as among those in the ""crowded areas."" In 2016, drugs in this class cost an average $3,588 per prescription and benefited from increases in utilization and unit cost, according to Express Scripts.But in the third quarter of 2017, things began to look dour for the likes of Celgene, which missed expectations for its inflammation drug Otezla by 26%. In the U.S., the lag was even sharper at 28%. One analyst suggested Celgene was forced to take a price concession.Celgene also cut its guidance for 2020 after terminating trials of a drug to treat Crohn's disease, a condition that results from chronic inflammation in the digestive tract. It now sees inflammation and immunology drugs bringing in a combined $2.6 billion to $2.8 billion in 2020, down from the $4 billion outlook it issued in 2015.Biotech companies and Big Pharma will need to ""get realistic"" on their pricing in these competitive arenas, King says. The same could be said for companies making treatments for hepatitis C, multiple sclerosis and high cholesterol. All are highly saturated markets.To the latter point, he expects prices for drugs known as PCSK9 inhibitors like Repatha from Amgen and Praluent from Regeneron and Sanofi to be under the microscope. These drugs lower bad LDL cholesterol in the blood. Evidence shows they also have a benefit on some cardiovascular outcomes.Repatha is listed at $14,100 per year, while Praluent costs $14,600. But rivals are closing in. Medicines Co. and Alnylam are working on another cholesterol drug, known as inclisiran. Meanwhile, analysts expect bempedoic acid from Esperion to be cheaper.Some of these Big Pharma and biotech companies ""are probably going to get their arms twisted a lot,"" King said. ""The pricing umbrella has created opportunities for new companies to come in and scale market share. Be careful if you own incumbents. Invest in the disruptors.""Other areas are seemingly immune to pricing pressure, analysts say.In 2016, the price of multiple sclerosis drugs rose an average 7.4%. That's a continuing trend, FBB's Bailey said. The price increases have been so egregious that House Democrats launched an investigation in August, noting that many of these drugs carry price tags north of $85,000 per year.The investigation was launched by Reps. Elijah Cummings and Peter Welch and centers on Bayer (BAYRY), Biogen (BIIB), EMD Sereno, Novartis, Roche (RHHBY), Sanofi and Teva.Among those pharmaceutical and biotech companies, Teva's 20-milligram dose of Copaxone has increased the most, rising 1,002% since its approval in 1996 to an annual price of $91,401 today, according to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. Novartis' Gilenya, approved in 2010, is the highest priced at $91,836.The investigation is ""10 years too late,"" he said. ""It's more difficult to push price control for specialty markets. Multiple sclerosis is a massive market now, but stakeholders view it as a specialty market.""Rare disease and innovative cancer therapies also seem immune to pricing controls, analysts say. For example, earlier this year Novartis and Gilead — via its acquisition of Kite Pharma — gained approval for CAR-T drugs known as Kymriah and Yescarta, respectively.CAR-T drugs are developed using a patient's own immune system cells. They are trained to seek out and destroy cancer cells. Kymriah goes for $475,000 per year and Yescarta is listed at $373,000, ARK Invest analyst Manisha Samy wrote in a recent post.""While gene therapies are beginning to cure cancer, they come at a price that can cause sticker stock,"" she said. ""That said, compared to traditional therapies that suppress, but do not cure cancer, the cost benefit analysis of gene therapy is compelling.""Pricing shock tends to tamp down on excitement for really compelling drugs, Bailey says. The prime example is Biogen and Ionis Pharmaceuticals' (IONS) Spinraza, the first spinal muscular atrophy drug approved. It costs $750,000 in its first year and $375,000 in subsequent years.But sentiment for the biotech companies' shares is already down, he said. So drug pricing concerns shouldn't be a big stock killer in 2018.""In the past when biotech stocks go up quickly, they get new drugs and people are excited, a lot of times someone will throw in a grenade: 'What about drug pricing?'"" Bailey said. ""But sentiment is already down. Even if there's a concern about drug pricing, I see a little less downside.""IBD's 462-company Biotech industry group is now ranked No. 34 out of 197 groups tracked, and has fallen from first just two months ago. Shares collectively neared a two-year high in October, but have since shucked almost 7% from that point.Over that same time, Amgen and Celgene — among the biggest biotechs — have seen their share prices dive 9% and 26%, respectively. Regeneron has taken a 19% hit and Gilead has tumbled 14%.Meanwhile, Alnylam and Esperion, which look likely to rival PSCK9 inhibitor drugmakers like Amgen and Regeneron, have lifted 7% and 5%, respectively. AbbVie, which recently launched a rival to Gilead's hepatitis C franchise, is up 5%.But Novartis and Lilly, which are competing against Celgene to treat inflammatory conditions, have seen their shares retreat, though to a smaller degree. Respectively, their share prices are down 1% and 2%, matching a 1% dip in IBD's 42-company Ethical Drugs industry group.Generic drug stocks, ranked No. 105 out of 197 groups, have actually broadly risen 2% since mid-October. But that's against respective 8% and 5% dips for Teva and Mylan (MYL), its two biggest names.RELATED:Teva's Restructuring Plan: Another Case Of Been Here, Done That?Generic Drug Makers Face Pricing Issues That Other Pharmas Don'tTop 6 Biotech Companies In Innovation Earn Recognition In New Awards

46,LLY,"Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR) rocketed to a 16-year high Tuesday after an analyst initiated coverage of the biotech firm with an outperform rating ahead of its third-quarter earnings and a key presentation for its immuno-oncology drug.XAt the closing bell on the stock market today, Nektar popped 10.5% to finish at 26.84, hitting a high it last saw in June 2001. After hours, shares jumped nearly 8% more, approaching the 29 level.Nektar uses a technology called pegylation to create its drugs. Pegylation improves a drug's solubility and decreases its ability to provoke an immune response in the body. Nektar has partnered with other firms on a number of drugs using pegylation.Cowen analyst Chris Shibutani sees Nektar as uniquely positioned to ""capitalize on high value opportunities in immuno-oncology and pain"" using its pegylation technology. He sees the cancer drug known as NKTR-214 as possibly being transforming.NKTR-214 is being tested with Bristol-Myers Squibb's (BMY) Opdivo as a treatment in five tumor types and eight potential diseases. Data from combination trials in melanoma and kidney cancer will be presented at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer meeting this week.""In the immuno-oncology refractory setting, our optimism regarding both melanoma and (kidney cancer) derives from proprietary expert survey work and consultant views,"" Shibutani said in a note to clients.Shibutani sees NKTR-214 pulling in risk-adjusted revenue of more than $950 million by 2023, above the upper end of consensus expectations. He also expects sentiment to improve on a drug known as NKTR-181, a potential treatment for lower back pain.NKTR-181 met its first and second goals in a Phase 3 trial presented in May. The drug is designed to provide pain relief without the high levels of euphoria associated with abuse and addiction of standard opioids.""We see potential for sentiment to improve on NKTR-181,"" Shibutani said. ""The debate on novel chronic pain drug NKTR-181 centers on regulatory timelines and (Drug Enforcement Agency) scheduling.""IBD'S TAKE: Nektar has an IBD Composite Rating of 56 out of a best-possible 99, meaning it outperforms just over half of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. But it's still poorly ranked as a biotech. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a look at better-rated biotech stocks.An update ahead of filing with the Food and Drug Administration as well as a potential partnership announcement should help reduce uncertainty on NKTR-181, Shibutani said.Also Tuesday, Nektar presented data for its drug dubbed NKTR-358, a potential treatment that could address underlying immune system imbalances in patients with a number of immune conditions.NKTR-358 is designed to target a specific set of receptors in the body to stimulate the proliferation of immune system cells, known as regulatory T cells, to help bring the immune system back into balance. The drug could be used to treat autoimmune conditions.In nonhuman primates, a single dose of NKTR-358 led to increases in regulatory T cells for over 14 days, according to the data Nektar released Tuesday. In mice, NKTR-358 proved efficient in treating the most common form of lupus.Nektar partnered with Eli Lilly (LLY) on NKTR-358 in July.Late Tuesday, Nektar is expected to release its third-quarter earnings. Analysts called for Nektar to report adjusted income of 21 cents per share on $125 million in sales. Earnings could grow from a 32-cent loss in the year-earlier period, and sales would be up 244%.RELATED:Mallinckrodt Dives After Sales Lag, Though Earnings Top ViewsTeva Survives Price Cut As Billionaire Reportedly Mulls StakeIs Big Pharma Addicted To Opioid Painkillers?

47,LLY,"Biogen (BIIB), Eli Lilly (LLY) and Novartis (NVS) toppled early Tuesday, despite beating analyst expectations in third quarter, as Biogen faced pressure in its multiple sclerosis unit and Novartis delayed a strategic decision regarding its Alcon eye unit.XLilly closed Monday in buy range, while Novartis was just below a breakout. Biogen, meanwhile, fell out of buy territory Tuesday and dropped below its 50-day moving average.Biogen slid 3.9% to close at 315.73, despite beating top- and bottom-line expectations, after its spinal muscular atrophy drug Spinraza failed to meet expectations for U.S. sales. Biogen's partner, Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS), also tumbled hard, falling 11% to 55.85 in recent action.Domestic sales of Spinraza came in light at $198 million, lagging RBC analyst Brian Abrahams' view for $221 million.Worldwide, however, Spinraza sales came in at $271 million, up 34%, and beating most analyst views between $240 million and $244 million, according to analysts with Leerink and Instinet.""Biogen disclosed that there was a 75% increase of the number of Spinraza patients in Q3 as compared to Q2, and the ex-U.S. launch is surpassing the initial U.S. trajectory,"" Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said in a note to clients. ""In the U.S., 80%-85% of all commercial and Medicaid lives now have access to Spinraza.""Further complicating Biogen's results were that sales its core multiple sclerosis unit trailed views by 1%, led by drug Tysabri, Porges said. Tysabri declined 9% to $469 million, 2% below the consensus.MS drug sales, excluding interferon, fell nearly 2% to $2.24 billion. Its top seller, Tecfidera, had a yearly sales gain to $1.07 billion, just below the consensus view at $1.08 billion, RBC's Abrahams said.IBD'S TAKE: President Donald Trump could enact an executive order to tug down on drug prices ""any day,"" a Washington, D.C.-based expert said recently. Head to IBD Industry Themes for more on what that could mean for the biotech and drug industry.Overall, Biogen earned $6.31 a share, up nearly 22%, as revenue rose north of 4% to $3.08 billion. Excluding its hemophilia business, which Biogen spun off in February into Bioverativ (BIVV), sales grew 13% year over year, the company said.Analysts had called for Biogen to report $3.04 billion in revenue and adjusted earnings of $5.70 per share.Lilly fell 2.3% to finish at 85.17 on the stock market today, after announcing its plan to potentially spin off, sell or file an initial public offering for its Elanco Animal Health unit. A decision is expected by mid-2018.Lilly reported adjusted income of $1.05 per share on sales of $5.66 billion, up a respective 19% and 9% vs. the year-earlier period. Both metrics topped the consensus of analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research for adjusted profit of $1.03 a share on $5.51 billion in sales.""The sales beat came from Humalog, new products Basaglar and Jardiance, and the animal health unit offset by a slight miss on Trulicity vs. our expectations and loss of exclusivity of Effient,"" Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez said in a note to clients.Revenue from diabetes drug Humalog rose 9% to $696.2 million. Sales of fellow diabetes drugs Basaglar and Jardiance increased by triple-digit percentages to $145.7 million and $127.2 million, respectively. Taltz, a plaque psoriasis drug, grew to $151.3 million.Sales of diabetes drug Trulicity posted a yearly gain of 117% to $527.7 million, but that missed some views.The firm also raised the midpoint of its full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance by 5 cents to $4.15-$4.25, which would rise 18%-21% on a year-over-year basis.Lilly expects to make a decision regarding an initial public offering, merger, sale or retention of its animal health unit, Elanco Animal Health, by the middle of 2018. Sales in that unit rose 5% to $740.6 million.Novartis shares slacked 3.2% to close at 83.13 though the drugmaker beat third-quarter expectations, after it delayed a strategic decision regarding its Alcon eye unit until 2019, saying it wants to beef up the division first.For the quarter, Novartis reported revenue of $12.41 billion on earnings of $1.29 a share vs. the year-earlier period in which the drugmaker posted $1.23 earnings per share on $12.13 billion in sales. Analysts had seen $1.25 and $12.17 billion, respectively, for the Swiss drug giant.Cosentyx — approved to treat plaque psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis and a rare form of arthritis known as Ankylosing Spondylitis — brought in $556 million in sales, beating the consensus by $17 million, Leerink's Fernandez said in another note to clients.But ""Entresto continues its linear but disappointing growth trajectory with $128 million in sales (vs. our estimate of $155 million and consensus of $141 million),"" Fernandez said. Entresto is approved to treat patients with chronic heart failure.All three of Novartis' business units were above expectations, Fernandez said. Its Sandoz segment surprised at $2.6 billion and Alcon delivered a ""critically strong performance,"" growing 7% on a constant-currency basis to $1.5 billion.RELATED:How Allergan's 'Public Relations Backlash' Deepened This WeekBiogen's Biomarkers Mark Way To Alzheimer's, Parkinson's TreatmentsDoes Gilead Now Have A New Multi-Billion-Dollar Franchise?

48,LLY,"Allergan (AGN) was already facing a ""public relations backlash"" after transferring patent rights for its Restasis eye medication to a Native American tribe, when a judge on Monday then invalidated four of those patents.XNow, Allergan faces an uphill battle in regaining credibility on Wall Street, Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan wrote in a note to clients. He cut his price target on Allergan to 243 from 266, but kept his outperform rating.""We generally have been fans of the Allergan management team, but find it challenging to defend the steps that were taken with the patent agreement,"" he wrote in a note to clients. ""We believe it will take some time for the management team to regain the credibility it has lost through this process.""The process involved transferring the rights to its Restasis patents to the St. Regis Mohawk Tribe in September to avoid a patent challenge. As a Native American tribe, St. Regis Mohawk has sovereign immunity. But the play has been called both creative as well as controversial.On Monday, a judge invalidated four patents covering Restasis. Judge William Bryson said the ideas covered by the patents were too obvious to protect. He also expressed serious concerns regarding the legitimacy of the transfer to St. Regis Mohawk.IBD'S TAKE: Allergan has an IBD Composite Rating of 54 out of a best-possible 99. It lags top players like AbbVie with a CR of 98, meaning it performs in the top 2% of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a look at other high-ranking drug stocks.Even before Monday, Allergan stock had lost 12% of its value following the agreement, Divan wrote. The loss in district court also does nothing to ""erase the public-relations backlash the company has suffered from going through with the agreement in the first place.""Combined with a push by the Food and Drug Administration to approve generic drugs at a faster clip, Divan assumes a generic launch of a Restasis drug by mid-2018, up from his earlier view for 2022. Mylan (MYL) and Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) are among those working on generic versions of the drug.For longer-term investors, Divan sees 198 as an attractive entry point to the stock. In the short term, catalysts include third-quarter earnings on Nov. 1 and the potential for a guidance update with and without generic Restasis competition.""If guidance is not provided on the Nov. 1 call (at least at a high level), investors will likely have to wait until the January time frame for the company's 2018 guidance,"" Divan said.Data readouts include a late-stage trial in treating acute migraines and a midstage trial of a drug to prevent migraines in the first half of 2018. Both belong to a class of drugs called anti-CGRPs. Teva, Amgen (AMGN), Eli Lilly (LLY) and Alder Biopharmaceuticals (ALDR) are also working in this arena.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Allergan slipped 0.3% to close at 197.78, after ending Monday trades down 3.5%.RELATED:Allergan Tanks After Judge Invalidates Restasis PatentsWhy Allergan's Hepatitis Drug Likely Won't Get FDA ApprovalGeneric Drug Makers Face Pricing Issues That Other Pharmas Don't

49,LLY,"Eli Lilly (LLY) will lay off 3,500 employees, about 8% of its workforce, to free up $500 million annually starting in 2018 amid a massive restructuring that includes closing some facilities, the drugmaker said early Thursday.XIn early trading on the stock market today, Lilly rose 1.3% to close at 81.54 Thursday. Shares began forming a cup-with-handle with an 85.63 buy point in late July.The lion's share of the workforce cut will stem from a voluntary early retirement program in the U.S. Remaining positions will come from workplace reductions and site closures. Lilly expects to incur charges of $1.2 billion related to the retirement program, severance costs and facility closures.Lilly plans to move its animal health manufacturing facility in Larchwood, Iowa, to an existing plant in Fort Dodge, Iowa. A research development office in Bridgewater, N.J., and a center in Shanghai, China, will be closed. The firm will also consolidate some of the work at its shared service centers.In total, Lilly expects to save $500 million annually starting in 2018. All workforce reductions and facility closures should be complete by Dec. 31. Savings will be funneled equally into improving the company's cost structure and reinvesting in business, Lilly said.IBD'S TAKE: Lilly has an IBD Composite Rating of 75, meaning it outperforms three-quarters of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. Still, it lags drug leader AbbVie, which has a CR of 95 out of a best-possible 99. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a closer look at top-rated drug stocks.The restructuring comes ahead of the expiration of Lilly's patent on erectile dysfunction drug Cialis in September 2018. Cialis is also approved under another name, Adcirca, as a treatment for high blood pressure in the lungs. That patent is set to expire in November, meaning generics can compete.Cialis is Lilly's second most important drug. It brought in $627.3 million in second-quarter sales, accounting for 11% of total sales, just behind its diabetes drug, Humalog, which brought in 12% of total revenue.Its patent covering attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder drug Strattera expired in May.

50,LLY,"CytomX Therapeutics (CTMX) flirted with a record high Wednesday after announcing a deal with No. 1 biotech Amgen (AMGN) to develop an immuno-oncology drug that could have fewer toxic side effects.XBy the close of trading on the stock market today, CytomX had rocketed 21.5% to 23.09, after earlier rising as much as 29.8% to an almost two-year high at 24.67. The previous record was a penny higher in December 2015.Shares broke out of a cup that began forming in March with a 20.12 entry point. Meanwhile, the broader biotech industry rose a fraction. The group is ranked second out of 197 groups IBD tracks.Amgen and CytomX will co-develop what the latter calls a probody-based drug. Probody therapeutics are meant to bind selectively to specific targets in tumors, and not to healthy tissue, to minimize toxicity and create safer cancer therapies, according to CytomX.The drug will target the epidermal growth factor receptor protein, or EGFR, to help immune system cells identify and destroy cancer cells. Using CytomX's probody technology will help ensure that the immune system only target EGFR proteins in tumor cells, not in healthy tissue.IBD'S TAKE: Amgen has an IBD Composite Rating of 93 out of a best-possible 99, meaning it trades better than nine in 10 stocks in terms of key growth metrics. Still, it's just 12th in IBD's 452-company Biotech industry group. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a look at other biotech leaders.EGFR-targeting drugs are already on the market, Instinet analyst Christopher Marai said in a note to clients. Eli Lilly's (LLY) Erbitux is approved to treat cancers of the head and neck, as well as the colon. But it is associated with severe toxicities, Marai said.He boosted his price target on CytomX stock to 44 from 32 and kept his buy rating. He noted that other data from Roche support the development of these drugs in solid tumors, rather than just blood cancers. CytomX's platform ""may reduce immune-related side effects and (gastrointestinal) toxicity,"" he said.Amgen will pay CytomX $40 million upfront and purchase $20 million of CytomX common stock. CytomX will be eligible to receive up to $455 million in milestone payments. Amgen will lead global commercial activities. CytomX will be able to opt into profit-sharing in the U.S. and receive tiered, double-digit royalties on net product sales outside the U.S.Under the terms of the deal, Amgen will also receive exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize up to three additional, undisclosed targets. Should Amgen pursue all three, CytomX will be eligible to receive up to $950 million in additional payments and high-single-digit to mid-double-digit royalties.CytomX will also receive the rights from Amgen to an undisclosed preclinical drug. Amgen is eligible to receive milestones and royalties resulting from any products developed and commercialized out of this program.RELATED:Why This Biotech Suffered A 2-Day Headache On Rare-Disease TrialAbbVie Patent Deal Staves Off Amgen Competition, But Others LurkWhy Amgen's Drug Win Sent AbbVie Stock Into The Stratosphere

52,LLY,"Biohaven Pharmaceuticals (BHVN) continued its two-day free fall Tuesday after its rare-disease drug failed in a trial — prompting at least two analysts to downgrade the stock.XBy the closing bell on the stock market today, Biohaven plunged 7% to close at 33.08. That came on top of a 4.9% drop on Monday, during a session in which shares fell as hard as 28.7%.Morgan Stanley analyst Matthew Harrison cut his price target on Biohaven to 38 from 47, though kept his overweight rating. He notes data from a migraine trial expected to be unveiled in the first quarter of 2018 could send shares to the mid-50s.On Tuesday investors were still reeling from Phase 2 and Phase 3 data of a drug to treat a degenerative disease of the brain. The drug, trigriluzole, failed to improve impairment vs. a placebo in patients with the disease known as spinocerebellar ataxia at eight weeks.After eight weeks of treatment, patients treated with trigriluzole showed an improvement of -0.81 points vs. an improvement of -1.05 points for patients on a placebo. A higher score indicates greater impairment, Harrison said.The placebo results were higher than expected, Harrison wrote in a note to clients. He removed spinocerebellar ataxia from his model on Biohaven. Previously, Harrison had expected a 75% chance of success for the program and $315 million in peak adjusted sales.IBD'S TAKE: Medtech stocks have broadly risen this year as concerns over drug pricing have sent some biotech and pharma investors for the hills. Can it keep going? Head to the Industry Snapshot for a closer look at the setup in medtech.Trigriluzole comes from what Biohaven calls its glutamate platform. Harrison still sees other drugs in this platform as having a chance of success in treating Alzheimer's disease, Rett Syndrome and ALS, a degenerative disease affecting nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord.Biohaven also is working on a migraine drug belonging to a class known as anti-CGRPs. The drug, dubbed Rimegepant, ""is the company's primary valuation driver,"" Harrison said. He projects $1.4 billion in peak U.S. sales.Amgen (AMGN), Eli Lilly (LLY), Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) and Alder Biopharmaceuticals (ALDR) are also working on drugs in this class.

Shares broke out of a cup earlier this month, hitting a buy point at 94.98.Galapagos is partnered with MorphoSys on a drug known as MOR106. In a Phase 1 trial, five out of six patients, or roughly 83%, treated with the highest dose saw their eczema symptoms improve by at least 50% by week four, the firm said in a news release.The results were maintained over two months after the last infusion. In patients treated with a placebo, only 17% achieved a 50% improvement in symptoms over the same time period. MOR106 will now advance to Phase 2 testing. Galapagos says it will consider switching the drug to an injection.RBC analyst Brian Abrahams noted MOR106 compared favorably with an approved drug called Dupixent from Regeneron and Sanofi. Analysts have predicted Dupixent could be a blockbuster for the two biopharma giants.IBD'S TAKE: Galapagos is also working in cystic fibrosis. But analysts say it lags Vertex Pharmaceuticals, a leading biotech aiming to eradicate cystic fibrosis as it's known today. Head to The New America for a deep dive on Vertex and its triple-pill approach to the lung disease.Dupixent, in combination with topical corticosteroids, helped 69% of patients achieve an improvement in symptoms of at least 75% by week 16, according to trial data on the drug's label. As a monotherapy, Dupixent achieved a similar improvement in 44%-51% of patients.Abrahams suggests MOR106 could also be used to treat inflammatory bowel disorder, which is already treated by drugs from Novartis (NVS) and Eli Lilly (LLY). These drugs belong to a similar class as MOR106. To be competitive, MOR106 would need to be an injection.RELATED:Biotechs On The Mend Even As Glaxo Backs Out Of Ionis DealVertex Hits Record High On Results Of Cystic Fibrosis TrialVertex Catapults 24% On Strong Trial For Cystic Fibrosis

56,LLY,"Array BioPharma (ARRY) shares were temporarily halted early Friday shortly before the biotech unveiled promising results of a Phase 3 trial in colon cancer.XBy the close of trading on the stock market today, Array was up 6.9% at 10.98, its highest point since mid-March.Array's tests showed that of 30 patients treated, 41% responded to a triple-drug therapy using Array's binimetinib and encorafenib, and Erbitux, a drug from Eli Lilly (LLY) that had been approved to treat head-and-neck cancer.The lion's share of patients had a specific genetic mutation that makes colon cancer hard to treat. Of the patients with that mutation who'd had one prior treatment, 59% responded to the triple-drug. Of those with the mutation and two prior treatments, 27% responded.IBD'S TAKE: September could be a ""make or break"" month for the biotech sector, according to one industry observer. Head to IBD Industry Themes to see who's on the line and what potential data could make headlines this month.Patients were treated over a median 5.6 months at the time of analysis and 76% are still on the treatment, Array said. Medium-to-severe side effects included nausea, vomiting, urinary tract infection and increased levels of a specific enzyme in the blood.Array presented the results ahead of a presentation Saturday during the European Society of Medical Oncology Congress in Madrid, Spain. The biotech is also set to discuss the results of a Phase 3 trial in melanoma patients with the same genetic mutation.RELATED:Why The Biotech 'Catch-Up Rally' Could Add Another 15%-20%How AbbVie Could Chip Away At Regeneron's Potential BlockbusterHow Two Biotechs Fell On Cancer Partnership With Bristol-Myers

57,LLY,"Theravance Biopharma (TBPH) and Exelixis (EXEL) tick off most of the acquisition boxes for Big Pharma in an overview of the biotech merger picture, an analyst said Friday.X""Acquisition of biotech companies by pharma is an important theme for the space,"" Needham analyst Alan Carr said in a note to clients. ""We believe late development-stage and commercial-stage biotech companies are particularly attractive acquisition targets, in part due to reduced risk.""Of the companies Carr covers, Theravance could attract big pharmas like Amgen (AMGN), Eli Lilly (LLY) and Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA). In total, Carr counts 21 companies that could be interested in buying Theravance based on research areas, business development interest and past acquisitions.Theravance has one approved drug, an antibiotic for hard-to-treat infections. Beyond that, Exelixis, Agios Pharmaceuticals (AGIO), Bavarian Nordic, Biohaven Pharmaceutical (BHVN) and Progenics Pharmaceuticals (PGNX) may be attracting the interest of 18 pharmaceuticals apiece.AbbVie, AstraZeneca (AZN), Novartis (NVS), Roche (RHHBY) and Dow stocks Pfizer (PFE) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) could be the most acquisitive, based on Carr's criteria. Each has at least 20 potential targets.But some biotechs may stand a better chance of being acquired vs. others, Carr said. Since January 2014, there have been 37 acquisitions of public biotech companies involving a payment of more than $250 million upfront.More than half already had an approved drug and 78% had at least some Phase 3 data, Carr wrote. Oncology was a key target for U.S. and Japanese pharmas, while rare-disease plays are likely to be acquired at later stages.IBD'S TAKE: Last month, one of these potential acquisition targets jumped to an IBD Relative Strength Rating of 92 out of a best-possible 99. Today, it still has a rating of 90. Head to IBD Data Stories for a closer look at the stock and its catalysts.Rare diseases tend to be of interest to mid-specialty pharmas and biotechs, as traditional drugmakers are likely to avoid the drug-pricing controversy. Since January 2014, the only rare-disease firm snatched up was Actelion Pharmaceuticals by J&J.U.S. and European pharma acquired more later-stage biotechs vs. the less risk-adverse Japanese pharmas and Allergan (AGN). Big areas of interest included central nervous system, rare diseases and oncology which accounted for 22%, 19% and 16% of acquisitions, respectively.Since January 2011, there have been 235 new chemical entry approvals by the Food and Drug Administration. Of the 65 small-to-midsize biotechs which gained this type of approval, 20 (31%) have been acquired. All of them already had a drug on the market at the time of the acquisition.""Many oncology companies, but few rare disease companies were acquired,"" he said.Gilead Sciences' (GILD) acquisition of Kite Pharma (KITE) could break that approval rule. Gilead announced its plan to spend $11.9 billion to buy Kite months ahead of the expected approval date of its first drug in a blood cancer. Novartis' rival treatment was approved days later.RELATED:This Small Biotech Launched To A 9-Month High Today — Here's WhyExelixis Recovers From Bristol-Inspired Pitfall In Kidney CancerBristol Dives But 'Still Has A Chance' In Kidney Cancer: Analyst

58,LLY,"Biogen (BIIB) stock jumped and neared a buy point Monday after its Alzheimer's disease treatment showed promise at the two-year and three-year marks.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Biogen shares climbed 2.5% 292.30, after rising as much as 3.7% to hit an intraday high of 295.50. Shares are consolidating with a buy point at 297.05, though they haven't topped 297 since early March.A common theory ties Alzheimer's to the buildup of plaque deposits in the brain called beta amyloid. Biogen is among those working on drugs to reduce amyloid deposits. Last year, Eli Lilly's (LLY) anti-amyloid drug failed to prove this theory.IBD'S TAKE: Biogen has an IBD Composite Rating of 90, meaning it outperforms nine in 10 stocks in terms of key growth metrics. But it still trails top-rated biotech Celgene (CELG), which has a best-possible CR of 99. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for other highly rated biotechs.Biogen could be closing in on proving the hypothesis. Scans showed amyloid reduction was consistent in patients treated with adjusted doses compared with fixed doses over two years. Patients treated up to three years showed a continued benefit on the rate of amyloid decline.In the Phase 1b long-term trial, the most common side effects were headache, falling and abnormalities in amyloid-related imaging, Biogen said. The firm plans to share more data at an upcoming medical congress.RELATED:Shire Nears 4-Year Low After CFO Announces Plan To Jump ShipBiogen, Teva Slip After Democrats Launch MS Drug Pricing ProbeBiogen Up On Alzheimer's Drug; Are MS Worries 'Overblown'?

59,LLY,"Eli Lilly (LLY) stock dropped to an 11-week low Thursday after its diabetes drug Trulicity proved less effective in a head-to-head comparison with Novo Nordisk's (NVO) rival medication, semaglutide.At the closing bell on the stock market today, Lilly was down 3.6% to 77.80. Novo slipped 1.3% to close at 45.34.The results put a potential damper on Lilly's five-year growth outlook, Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan wrote in a note to clients. The study, dubbed Sustain-7, compared the once-weekly drugs, both of which belong to a class known as GLP-1 medicines.Patients treated with semaglutide over 40 weeks saw a stronger reduction in glycated hemoglobin levels (or uncontrolled glucose in the blood) and body weight vs. those treated with Trulicity, Novo said in a news release. Semaglutide further proved safe, bucking worries it would be associated with a high level of retinopathy, a common eye disease in diabetes.In an earlier trial, semaglutide was associated with a greater risk of retinopathy. But in the Sustain-7 trial, five Trulicity patients developed retinopathy vs. four semaglutide patients.IBD'S TAKE: Novo Nordisk leads the specialty drugmakers industry group with an IBD Composite Rating of 88 out of a best-possible 99, meaning it outperforms nearly nine in 10 stocks in terms of key growth metrics. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a closer look at strong drug stocks.""The rates of retinopathy were low and comparable between the two arms, likely removing a potential commercial advantage that Trulicity could have had over semaglutide,"" Divan said. Still, he kept his outperform rating and 88 price target on Lilly stock.All together the results point to the likelihood that semaglutide will ""be a fairly formidable competitor to Trulicity and slow down the growth of what we see as Lilly's most important product,"" he wrote.Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez, too, sees the growth trajectory of Trulicity suffering as a result of semaglutide's imminent entrance to the market. Lilly is currently working on a trial to determine if there's a cardiovascular benefit of Trulicity, set to readout in the second half of 2018.But ""given uncertainties in the diabetes reimbursement dynamics in 2018, it's unclear how market share shifts will affect semaglutide and Trulicity sales,"" Fernandez wrote in a note to clients. He kept market perform ratings on Novo and Lilly stocks.RELATED:Why Dow's Merck Is Credit Suisse's Top Pharma PickTeva Pharma Crashes To 13-Year Low On 'Very Tough Quarter'How Dow's Merck Is Benefiting On The Backs Of AstraZeneca, Bristol
"
60,LLY,"AstraZeneca (AZN) and Eli Lilly (LLY) face ""tough tasks"" of not disappointing during the upcoming European Society of Medical Oncology meeting, an analyst said Thursday as he noted a series of looming catalysts for the drug industry.XThe market is assuming multibillion dollar peak sales for AstraZeneca's Imfinzi and Tagrisso, Jefferies analyst Jeffrey Holford wrote in a note to clients. AstraZeneca is set to present trial information for both during the September conference.Imfinzi is an immuno-oncology drug with accelerated approval to treat bladder cancer. It was tested in one trial to treat advanced lung cancer. Tagrisso has accelerated approval to treat lung cancer and recently wrapped a different series of tests for lung cancer.""Any shortfalls in quality or even just treatment durations could drive up to 8%-10% downside moves for either study in our view,"" Holford wrote. The trials are important after AstraZeneca's immuno-oncology combination trial disappointed in July.Eli Lilly, meanwhile, needs to positively surprise on what is known as the Monarch 3 trial for its breast cancer drug abemaciclib after setbacks for drugs baricitinib and Trulicity. Regulators recently delayed baricitinib, a rheumatoid arthritis drug.IBD'S TAKE: Drugmakers are ranked No. 105 out of 197 groups IBD tracks. Keep tabs on strong sectors and the best performers within them by bookmarking IBD Data Stories.Last week, Novo Nordisk's (NVO) diabetes drug semaglutide proved more effective than Lilly's Trulicity on two measures in a head-to-head comparison. Both belong to a class of diabetes drugs called GLP-1 medicines.""If it can achieve this (positive results in Monarch 3), we see 3%-5% midterm earnings and valuation upside against 2%-4% downside if it misses out more conservative expectations,"" Holford said.Dow's Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Bayer (BAYRY) look likely to benefit from the European Society of Cardiology conference when they unveil results of a trial testing the ability of their drug, Xarelto, to reduce major cardiovascular events in patients with heart diseases.""The key focus will be on the bleeding profile given the market appears to assume that only the Xarelto/aspirin combo arm will hit, but with excessive bleeding,"" Holford said. A more positive outcome could spike Bayer stock 4%-6%.Similarly, Novartis (NVS) is expected to present full results from a trial called Campos which looked at a drug known as ACZ885 in reducing cardiovascular risk in patients who've survived a heart attack. Good results could prod Novartis up 5%-7%.RELATED:How Two Drugmakers Will Benefit On AstraZeneca's CoattailsAll Eyes Will Be On This Dow Component's 'Star' Drug Next WeekWhy Dow's Merck Is Credit Suisse's Top Pharma Pick

61,LLY,"September will be a ""make or break"" month for a number of biotechs, including Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (ALNY), Axovant Sciences (AXON) and Versartis (VSAR), which are expected to present Phase 3 data in the upcoming weeks.XBiotech stocks could be poised for another run, says Loncar Investments Chief Executive Brad Loncar. Year to date, they've risen 28% and hit a 20-month high on Sept. 1. Shares have risen following Gilead Sciences' (GILD) announcement that it would acquire Kite Pharma (KITE).All of that comes before an incredibly newsworthy September that will feature at least five major medical conferences, at least 10 big investor conferences and nearly a dozen Phase 3 trials expected to read out, Loncar told Investor's Business Daily.""This might be the most newsworthy month in biotech history,"" he said. ""What's so amazing this September is there are a ton of Phase 3 trials that are scheduled to read out. The company itself is either going to succeed or fail because of these trial readouts.""""I count seven of them that are make or break for the companies,"" Loncar said.Loncar counts 11 key trial readouts in September. But principal among them, he notes, is Alnylam, which is expected to unveil the results of a trial of a drug dubbed patisiran for a rare disease that causes the buildup of abnormal material called amyloid throughout the body.Success could be a major catalyst for the technologies known as RNA interference and antisense, which essentially turn off malfunctioning genes, Leerink analyst Paul Matteis wrote in a note to clients Tuesday.IBD'S TAKE: Novartis' IBD Relative Strength Rating was boosted Friday to 71 from 65 out of a best-possible 99. The grade shows how the stock's price moved over the past 52 weeks against all other stocks in our database. Head to IBD Data Stories to see how Novartis stacks up against its rivals.Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS) is also working on a Phase 3 drug, known as inotersen, to treat the disease called TTR amyloidosis.Matteis calls for an upside of 5%-15% depending on the magnitude of success and safety, and a downside of 15%-20% if the drug proves effective but mixed on safety. He sees downside of 70% if Alnylam's drug fails completely in the trial.According to Loncar, ""Most people are convinced it's going to succeed."" He cited a note that saw the range of failure to success putting Alnylam's stock price at 25 to 105 per share. It closed at 86.80 on Tuesday.""For that company, that's a $7 billion window,"" he said. ""This is a bellwether biotech company. Everyone is counting on this one to succeed, and it probably will. But if that one trial fails, the stock will crash.""Behind Alnylam, Loncar notes that Axovant is expected to announce the results of its drug dubbed intepirdine in mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. Recently, Biogen (BIIB) stock broke out on strong Phase 1b data from an Alzheimer's trial.Axovant is working on a different theory of treating Alzheimer's. Intepirdine is known as a serotonin receptor antagonist, which has potential cognition, memory and learning-enhancing side effects. It was originally developed by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) but sold to Axovant.So far, nothing has worked in Alzheimer's, so there's always some excitement — and trepidation — around trial readouts for the disease, Loncar said. Last December, Eli Lilly (LLY) toppled when its drug, solanezumab, failed in a Phase 3 trial of Alzheimer's.""If Axovant does succeed, we could see a stock go from 20 to 100 in one day,"" he said. Axovant closed at 20.35 on Tuesday. ""That's extreme. But that's the kind of euphoria Alzheimer's can create.""He also notes trials from Versartis and Zogenix (ZGNX) in growth hormone deficiency and a form of epilepsy known as Dravet syndrome, respectively.But it won't just be September that's chock full of catalysts, Leerink analysts wrote in a note to clients Tuesday. After ""a solid year for returns of biopharma stocks"" there are still a number of catalysts in the back half of the year.Among large-caps, Leerink's Geoffrey Porges notes that AbbVie (ABBV) will have data from trials for anti-inflammatory and cancer drugs, and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) is expected to grab another approval for its drug Soliris to treat a disease in which the immune system attacks healthy cells.Amgen (AMGN) could update its label for LDL cholesterol-lowering drug, Repatha, to include its added benefit on cardiovascular outcomes. Meanwhile, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Sanofi (SNY) are appealing a court decision vs. Amgen for their rival drug, Praluent.Celgene (CELG) will have readouts in ulcerative colitis and a form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. FibroGen (FGEN) is expected to have data for fibrosis and anemia drugs. Analysts expect Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) to provide an update with data from its cystic fibrosis trials.Gilead-Kite's CAR-T drug will likely be approved to treat an aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in November. This would follow the approval of Novartis' (NVS) Kymriah, a CAR-T drug that treats a form of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in patients up to age 25.""We expect CAR-T to remain one of the most closely followed emerging areas in biotech in the second half of 2017,"" Leerink analyst Michael Schmidt wrote in a note.

62,LLY,"Dow Jones component Merck (MRK) remains Credit Suisse's top pick heading into the European Society for Medical Oncology conference in October, but drugmakers Allergan (AGN) and Eli Lilly (LLY) also look strong, the brokerage said Monday.Around that time, Merck is expected to unveil the results of its trial, dubbed Keynote-189, testing immuno-oncology drug Keytruda plus chemotherapy in previously untreated patients with advanced lung cancer. The combo received accelerated approval in May.""We expect continued discussions around the potential uses of Keytruda while awaiting the top-line data from the confirmatory Keynote-189 study in the September/October time frame, which we expect to be positive,"" Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan said.On its second-quarter conference call in July, Merck confirmed a cyberattack could delay some products this year, saying ""full recovery from the cyberattack will take some time."" Still, Merck is best-positioned for the remainder of 2017, Divan said in a note to client.Merck shares ended the regular trading session up 0.5% to 62.67.Though investors seem to prefer AbbVie (ABBV) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), Divan is placing his bets on Allergan and Lilly. Still, there are several months until Allergan is expected to unveil data in a migraine trial, he said.And though Lilly offers a diverse pipeline, more interest is on Novo Nordisk's (NVO) trial known as Sustain-7, which is looking at its diabetes drug semaglutide vs. Lilly's Trulicity. Divan sees Trulicity as safer than Novo's drug.Lilly is expected to unveil data from a trial of its drug abemaciclib in breast cancer during an upcoming oncology conference, Divan said. Lilly is also planning to file applications for a migraine drug and is driving adoption of new drugs in cancer and plaque psoriasis.IBD'S TAKE: Biotechs have struggled lately and are now ranked seventh out of 197 groups tracked by IBD, down from fifth last week. The sector hit a seven-week low Thursday after hitting an 18-month high in July. Head to IBD Industry Themes for more on what happened.Meanwhile, Divan isn't as bullish on the commercial potential of drugs from AbbVie in inflammatory diseases and immuno-oncology. He also calls for ""relatively rapid erosion"" of sales from key drug Humira in the U.S. once generics enter the market, likely in 2022.In Bristol's case, rumors it could become a takeover target have limited its stock in the near term. But early assets in immuno-oncology and potential approvals in kidney and liver cancers could drive upside over time, Divan argued.Credit Suisse also reinstated coverage of Dow stock Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) in July, but Divan noted its valuation may be limiting investor interest. This will likely change after J&J's release of data from its Compass trial during the European Society of Cardiology meeting.That meeting is set later this month. J&J is looking at the ability of its anticoagulant, Xarelto, to prevent major adverse cardiac events including cardiovascular death, heart attack and stroke in patients with some heart diseases.""We expect Compass to be the star of the meeting and has the potential to dramatically increase uptake of Xarelto in the coming quarters, something that can move the needle even for a company J&J's size,"" Divan wrote.But Divan also noted he downgraded Pfizer (PFE) and Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) to neutral ratings from outperform during the quarter. Dow stock Pfizer is struggling with near-term catalysts and a lacking acquisitive appetite amid the potential for tax reform.Teva, on the other hand, is range-bound ""until a new leadership team is in place, a strategy to reduce their debt is more certain and more clarity on the potential of generic versions of Copaxone (a multiple sclerosis drug) 40-milligrams is obtained,"" he wrote.RELATED:Will Pfizer's Cancer Drugs Help It Grow Without A Merger?Generic Drugs Are Rebounding Despite Teva, Mylan Free-FallPerrigo's Beat-And-Raise Lifts Generic Drugs, Bucks Teva-Mylan Trend

63,LLY,"Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) crashed to a 13-year low Thursday after the generic drugmaker reported second-quarter metrics that lagged estimates, and cut its 2017 sales and earnings guidance.XIt was ""a very tough quarter,"" Evercore analyst Umer Raffat wrote in a note to clients. On the stock market today, Teva plunged 24% to 23.75, a floor last seen in November 2004.Second-quarter revenue of $5.69 billion grew 13% year over year, but lagged the consensus of analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research for $5.85 billion. Adjusted income of $1.02 per share missed by 9 cents, and fell 18.4% vs. the year-earlier period.Key multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone brought in $1.02 billion in sales, down 10% year over year, but that still beat expectations for $955 million, Mizuho analyst Irina Koffler wrote in a note to clients. In the U.S., sales fell 12% after Teva lost four patents on the drug in January.The decline in Copaxone sales followed a 7.9% price increase in January, Teva said in a news release. Teva blamed negative net pricing and lower volumes of Copaxone for the year-over-year decrease. Raffat noted other multiple sclerosis players aren't reporting pricing pressure.Mizuho's Koffler says Copaxone can continue to support Teva's stock price, ""but these revenues are not durable in our view."" Pending a review of her model, Koffler kept a 30 price target and neutral rating on Teva.IBD'S TAKE: Teva is among four key rivals working on migraine drugs alongside Amgen (AMGN), Eli Lilly (LLY) and Alder Biopharmaceuticals (ALDR). Visit IBD's Technology page to get the breakdown on how these rivals stack up in the market.Overall, specialty medicines revenue declined 9% in the quarter as sales in the generics unit grew 20% to $3.08 billion. The major growth in generic revenue followed the acquisition of Actavis Generics in August 2016.Teva also cut its 2017 sales guidance to $22.8 billion to $23.2 billion from its earlier view for $23.8 billion to $24.5 billion. Earnings per share are expected to come in at $4.30-$4.50 from prior expectations for $4.90-$5.30.Furthermore, Teva cut its dividend to 8.5 cents, down 75% from the first-quarter payout.RELATED:AstraZeneca Pops On Report CEO Won't Jump Ship For Teva PharmaRegeneron Earnings, Revenue Top Views; Stock PopsAllergan Boosts 2017 Outlook After Beating Q2 ForecastsWhy AstraZeneca's Rumored Chief Executive Exit Is Bad TimingThis Biotech Crashed 28% Despite Positive Migraine Drug Tests

64,LLY,"Corvus Pharmaceuticals (CRVS) rocketed to a four-month high Thursday after an analyst upgraded the stock ahead of data expected in November from an immuno-oncology partnership with Roche's (RHHBY) Genentech.XIn morning trading on the stock market today, Corvus popped as much as 9.6% to a high last seen in early April, but recently was up 7.6%, near 14, in recent trades. Portola Pharmaceuticals (PTLA) also lifted 2.2%, near 57.50, after grabbing an upgrade.Meanwhile, downgraded Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) sank 0.3%, near 16.40. Alder Biopharmaceuticals (ALDR), though, rose 1.8%, near 9.70, after sustaining a price-target haircut.Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan upgraded Corvus to neutral from an underperform rating and boosted his price target to 14 from 12. During the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer meeting in November, the firm is expected to unveil Phase 1 data for its drug known as CPI-444.CPI-444 is designed to block the action of a molecule produced by tumors that hinders immune response. Corvus began a Phase 1B trial with Genentech in early 2016 to look at CPI-444 alone and in combination with an immuno-oncology drug known as a PD-L1 antibody.""Our underperform rating on Corus had been driven by limited enthusiasm around the clinical data to date for CPI-444, as well as a quiet near-term catalyst calendar,"" Divan wrote in a note to clients.IBD'S TAKE: Biotech fever has chilled over the past several weeks following the second-quarter earnings season. IBD's 445-company Biotech industry group is now ranked eighth out of 197 groups tracked, down from fifth just a month ago. Head to IBD Industry Themes for the issues boiling under the surface.Divan also upgraded Portola to outperform from a neutral rating and kept his 70 price target. The stock has sold off following its second-quarter earnings report in which the biotech said it's working through some manufacturing issues that could delay the launch of its drug, Bevyxxa.Bevyxxa is a treatment to prevent blood clots in hospitalized patients at risk due to moderate or severe mobility restrictions. It's Portola's only approved drug. But approval also could be coming for its drug, AndexXa, an anticoagulant.Teva, on the other hand, sustained a downgrade to underperform from a neutral rating and Divan slashed his price target to 13 from 25.""While Teva has dramatically reduced fiscal 2017 guidance, we do not expect the core challenges they are facing to fade anytime soon,"" he wrote. Teva continues to face pricing pressure in U.S. generics and upcoming competition for its multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone.The firm has yet to appoint a full-time chief executive and is talking about potential sales of noncore assets to pay down debt that eclipsed $35 billion in the June quarter. Divan wants to see the final details of these transactions before ""giving Teva full credit.""He also trimmed his price target on Alder to 11 from 17, though kept his neutral rating. Alder will most likely have to spend significantly to compete in a crowded market, he said. A key migraine drug, eptinezumab, is in Phase 3 trials and is rivaled by drugs from Teva, Eli Lilly (LLY) and Amgen (AMGN).""Upside risk could come from positive updates on a self-administration formulation and more differentiated clinical data,"" he said. ""Downside risk could come from strong competitor launches or setbacks in eptinezumab development.""RELATED:Teva And Mylan Under Pressure As Rivalries Loom For Key DrugsBiogen, Teva Slip After Democrats Launch MS Drug Pricing ProbeThis Toppling Generic Drugmaker Could Be Poised For A Rebound: Analyst

65,LLY,"A delay in getting its rheumatoid arthritis drug to market by at least 18 months sent Eli Lilly (LLY) shares lower Tuesday as the drug giant reported second-quarter earnings.XOn the stock market today, Lilly toppled 3% to close at 82.19. Shares had been in a buy zone at Monday's close after breaking out of a cup-with-handle at an 84.86 buy point. Lilly's partner on the arthritis drug, Incyte (INCY), fell 3.4% to finish at 133.56.The Food and Drug Administration is requiring Lilly and Incyte to run another trial to determine the benefits and risks across doses of the drug, now known as baricitinib, before resubmitting their application for approval.Lilly estimates at least 18 months to resubmit the application, putting the approval of baricitinib beyond 2017. Baricitinib is approved in Europe to treat moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis.Also early Tuesday, Lilly reported $5.82 billion in second-quarter sales, ahead of the consensus for $5.59 billion from analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research.Adjusted profits of $1.11 per share topped by 7 cents, according to Zacks. Revenue grew 8% with profits per share up 29%.IBD'S TAKE: Biotech stocks are on a hot streak, now ranked fourth out of 197 groups tracked by IBD. But mergers and acquisitions could send them higher, some say. Visit IBD Industry Themes for a deep dive on who might be for sale.Diabetes drug Trulicity and plaque psoriasis drug Taltz led growth in the quarter, up 139% and 618%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier quarter. Sales of Basaglar, an insulin to treat adults and children with Type 1 diabetes, grew 432%.Lilly also raised its 2017 sales guidance to $22 billion to $22.5 billion, up from earlier views for $21.8 billion to $22.3 billion.

66,LLY,"Dow's Merck (MRK) is benefiting on the backs of AstraZeneca (AZN) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), an analyst said Monday, citing higher expectations for immuno-oncology drugs combined with chemotherapy.XUBS analyst Marc Goodman's assessment came after Merck and AstraZeneca said they would team up to test their drugs Keytruda and Lynparza in several cancers, and following Merck's consensus-crushing second quarter.On the stock market today, Merck dipped fractionally to close at 63.88. AstraZeneca inched down 0.3% to 30.18. Bristol-Myers popped 3% to finish at 56.90, on its recent tie with Clovis Oncology (CLVS) in breast, ovarian and prostate cancers.""The past two days have been good to Merck with diminished expectations for immuno-oncology/immuno-oncology and thus higher for immuno-oncology/chemo,"" Goodman said in a note to clients.Merck is combining its immuno-oncology drug Keytruda with Eli Lilly's (LLY) chemotherapy Alimta to treat advanced lung cancer. The combination received accelerated approval in May. Meanwhile, its rivals appear to be struggling.IBD'S TAKE: Earnings season is well underway and five top tech stocks are near buy points this week. Head to IBD's Research page for a closer look on which make for strong bets.Last week, AstraZeneca announced its combination of immuno-oncology drugs Imfinzi and tremelimumab failed in a late-stage trial of advanced lung cancer patients. That doesn't look good for Bristol-Myers, which is working on a similar combo.Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez says AstraZeneca's failure with Imfinzi and tremelimumab ""leaves Keytruda's dominance"" intact as a first treatment in advanced lung cancer. But long-term growth will require a more aggressive business development strategy, he said.Fernandez boosted his price target on Merck to 69 from 68, citing the drugmaker's new partnership with AstraZeneca. He has an outperform rating on Merck. For AstraZeneca, the partnership is ""an admission of defeat in the initial immuno-oncology race.""To get access to Keytruda, a PD-1 inhibitor, AstraZeneca sold off half the rights to Lynparza, its PARP inhibitor. But AstraZeneca already has drug similar to Keytruda. Its drug Imfinzi is a PD-L1 inhibitor, which operates via a similar mechanism.AstraZeneca and Merck are working on the theory that combining an immuno-oncology drug with a PARP inhibitor will offer a stronger anti-cancer response, similar to AstraZeneca's and Bristol's theories that combinations of immuno-oncology drugs will be particularly robust in some cancers.Merck is now at a strategic advantage, Goodman said. Keytruda sales beat Wall Street views in the second quarter, growing 180% to $881 million. Sales of Keytruda in lung cancer comprised half of U.S. sales with the majority coming from use as a monotherapy, Goodman said.""A year ago, expectations were high for Bristol and low for Merck,"" he said. ""Those expectations have now been reversed, so we think Keytruda sales need to ramp materially from here and data needs to support the current view to keep this stock moving higher.""RELATED:Dow's Merck Crushed Keytruda Sales Views By $68 MillionHow AstraZeneca Failed Not Once — But Twice — In Cancer DrugsWhy Clovis, Regeneron Are Leading A Biotech Deluge Today
"
67,LLY,"Dow's Merck (MRK) beat analyst expectations for its star cancer drug Keytruda by $68 million and delivered an across-the-board beat for its second quarter — prodding shares to lift Friday.XInvestors have been ""laser-focused"" on Keytruda sales since its launch as a combination with Eli Lilly's (LLY) chemotherapy Alimta, Evercore analyst Umer Raffat said. The combo received accelerated approval in May as a first treatment for patients with advanced lung cancer.During the quarter, Keytruda sales grew 180% to $881 million. Merck credited growth in its oncology unit to higher Keytruda sales amid additional approvals. Keytruda closely rivals Bristol-Myers Squibb's (BMY) Opdivo.Hepatitis C drug Zepatier and human papillomavirus drug Gardasil also helped drive a topline beat, bringing in a respective $517 million and $469 million in sales. Investors likely didn't give a lot of credence to Zepatier due to struggles elsewhere in hepatitis C drugs, Raffat said in a note.Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez noted that sales of diabetes drugs Januvia and Janumet were lower than expected. Revenue from the two drugs declined 8% year over year to $1.51 billion.Overall sales grew 1% to $9.93 billion, beating analyst expectations for $9.75 billion. Adjusted earnings of $1.01 per share grew 8.6% year over year, and crushed consensus views for 87 cents.IBD'S TAKE: Merck and Bristol-Myers Squibb are squaring off in immuno-oncology. Get the latest on the battle via IBD's Technology page.Merck also narrowed its full-year guidance to $39.4 billion to $40.4 billion in sales and $3.76-$3.88 adjusted earnings per share. It noted that a cyberattack on June 27 disrupted global operations and says some products could see temporary delays in certain markets.On the stock market today, Merck advanced 0.7 % to 64.11, continuing to rebound from Wednesday's near-six-month low of 61.72. Shares have been forming a flat base since early March with a buy point at 66.90.RELATED:How AstraZeneca Failed Not Once — But Twice — In Cancer DrugsWhy Celgene's $413 Million Gamble Helps This Small Biotech MoreDeal May Help Celgene Rival Dow's Merck, Bristol In Cancer Drugs

68,LLY,"Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) could put the hurt on Dow component Merck (MRK), an analyst said, after Merck's flagship immuno-oncology drug missed its goal in a head-and-neck cancer trial.XOn the stock market today, Bristol climbed 0.6% to 55.95, while Merck dipped 0.3% to 62.36, following news reports late Monday in their immuno-oncology programs.Merck's Keytruda gained accelerated approval in 2016 in treating head-and-neck cancer — contingent upon late-stage trials confirming prior successes. But in a trial dubbed Keynote-040, Keytruda narrowly missed its goal. Meanwhile, Bristol said it's seeking a new four-week, 30-minute dosing schedule for its rival drug Opdivo.Neither item of news is likely to meaningfully affect near-term sales, Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan said in a note to clients, but ""each one could lead to positive upside for Bristol's Opdivo and pressure on Merck's Keytruda if we look out over the medium-longer term.""Divan notes that there are earlier trials that Merck could use as confirmation of success in using Keytruda to treat head-and-neck cancer, like Keynote-048, ""assuming they read out positively.""In the meantime, Keytruda will keep its accelerated approval for head-and-neck cancer, pending further trials. Head-and-neck cancer represented 15% of Merck's Keytruda sales in the U.S. in the first quarter.IBD'S TAKE: Biotechs are now ranked fourth among 197 groups tracked by IBD. But they could be ""cooking with gas"" if pent-up demand for an acquisition by one larger player comes to fruition. Who could this biotech buy — and why? Head to IBD Industry Themes.""Should future Keytruda trials in head-and-neck cancer also deliver disappointing news, then some of these revenues could be at risk,"" Divan said.At the same time that Merck announced the results of its Keynote-040 study, Bristol said the Food and Drug Administration had accepted its application to have Keytruda's rival, Opdivo, dosed at 480-milligrams every four weeks for 30 minutes.Keytruda and Opdivo belong to the same class of immuno-oncology drugs, targeting a protein called PD-1 in the immune system. Immuno-oncology drugs work to teach the immune system to identify and destroy cancer cells.Opdivo is now approved as a weight-based treatment for various cancers, including head-and-neck cancer, dosed over the course of a 60-minute infusion. Patients receive the infusion every two to three weeks depending on the type of cancer.Divan called this a ""potentially important commercial milestone"" that would make the office visit better for the patient and office staff.""Both Keytruda and Roche's (RHHBY) Tecentriq are dosed every three weeks and other companies have commented on looking at longer potential regimens, but Bristol may now have the advantage on this front,"" he said.Merck, though, says it's comfortable with its current every-three-week schedule for Keytruda, noting that it lines up nicely with how Eli Lilly's (LLY) Alimta is dosed, Divan said. Keytruda and Alimta are being studied as a combination in advanced lung cancer.RELATED:Could This Small Biotech Break Out On A Tie-Up With Eli Lilly?This Biotech Nearly Tripled Street Expectations For One Key DrugWhy AstraZeneca's Rumored Chief Executive Exit Is Bad Timing

69,LLY,"S&P 500 index futures rose early Tuesday morning, but Nasdaq 100 futures fell after Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) reported higher-than-expected traffic acquisition costs to partner sites, with some blaming Apple (AAPL). Meanwhile, four notable stocks that are near buy points report early Tuesday: General Motors (GM), Eli Lilly (LLY), 3M (MMM) and New Oriental Education & Technology (EDU).XThe Nasdaq composite rose 0.4% on Monday, hitting another all-time high. The S&P 500 index dipped 0.1% and the Dow Jones industrial average retreated 0.3%.Nasdaq 100 futures fell a fraction vs. fair value. But S&P 500 index futures rose nearly 0.2% while Dow futures climbed 0.3%.Alphabet reported better-than-expected second-quarter earnings and revenue, factoring in a $2.7 billion charge for a European Union regulatory fine. But traffic acquisition costs (TAC), what it pays partners to carry its ads, shot up 28% to $5.09 billion. That could be tied to a revised search deal with Apple, analysts said.Alphabet had closed up 0.45% to 998.31, rising as high as 1,006.10 intraday, just below a 1,008.71 buy point from a flat base. But Google's parent fell nearly 3% in early trading Tuesday.While overnight action doesn't always translate into regular-session stock performance, Alphabet shows that being near a buy point is not the same as actually rising above it. Still, stocks approaching sound entries from bullish patterns are often worth watching. Here are four stocks near buy points that are reporting quarterly results early Tuesday.General Motors cleared a 36.10 cup-with-handle buy point on July 14, and continued to edge higher in below-average volume for a few days. But GM shares have retreated for the past three sessions, losing 0.7% to 35.84, dropping below the still-valid entry.Analysts expect GM's per-share profit to fall 7.5% to $1.72 as revenue drops 5% to $40.25 billion, according to consensus estimates from Zacks Investment Research.For the past three sessions Eli Lilly shares have risen intraday above an 84.86 buy point in a cup-with-handle base, only to close just below that level. Lilly ended Monday at 84.74.Eli Lilly is expected to report EPS of $1.04 up 21% vs. 86 cents a year earlier. Revenue should climb 3% to $5.589 billion vs. $5.405 billion.The industrial conglomerate and Dow Jones industrial average component has formed a short flat base with a potential entry of 214.67. 3M closed Monday at 210.Analysts expect 3M to deliver a 24.5% EPS jump to $2.59, with revenue up nearly 3% to $7.879 billion.Fellow Dow components McDonald's (MCD), United Technologies (UTX), DuPont (DD) and Caterpillar (CAT) also report Tuesday.The Chinese operator of for-profit schools is a member of the IBD 50. New Oriental Education has formed a cup base with an 83.31 buy point. Shares rose 1.7% to 80.49 on Monday.New Oriental is expected to report 38 cents per U.S. share, up 52% vs. a year earlier, with revenue up 21% to $478.8 million, according to Thomson Reuters figures.TAL Education (TAL), another Chinese school company, is No. 1 on the IBD 50 list.

70,LLY,"Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR) stock neared a breakout Monday after announcing a deal with Eli Lilly (LLY) to develop an drug that could stoke the immune system to fight autoimmune and inflammatory conditions.XIn morning trading on the stock market today, Nektar popped 3.2% to close at 22.95 after earlier rising as much as 7%. Shares are up 81% for the year, and began forming a cup with a 24.98 buy point in late March. At the same time, Lilly stock was up fractionally to 84.74.Lilly and Nektar will codevelop a drug known as NKTR-358. The drug works by stimulating a specific pathway in the body to generate a greater immune system response. By activating certain cells, NKTR-358 can act to bring the immune system back into balance, the firms said.The drug is entering Phase 1 testing to determine correct dosing. It is being developed as a once or twice monthly self-administered injection for a number of autoimmune diseases, the companies said in a news release.Evercore analyst Umer Raffat sees NKTR-358 as a potential treatment for Lupus, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis and ""perhaps even multiple sclerosis, graft-versus-host disease and Type 1 diabetes.""IBD'S TAKE: Nektar has an IBD Composite Rating of 56, meaning it outperforms just over half of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. It lags leaders like Celgene (CELG), Corcept Therapeutics (CORT) and Supernus Pharmaceuticals (SUPN) which have best-possible CRs of 99. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a list of the top-rated biotechs.Phase 1 trial information is due in the third quarter, Raffat wrote in a research report.Under the terms of the deal, Lilly will pay Nektar a $150 million upfront fee and make $250 million milestone payments. Lilly will foot the bill for 75% of the research and development costs after Phase 1 wraps up. Nektar is response for Phase 1 costs.Nektar will receive ""double-digit royalties that increase commensurate with their Phase 3 investment and product sales,"" the companies said. Nektar will be able to co-promote in the U.S. for certain treatments.Raffat noted Nektar's main program is actually a drug known as NKTR-214 which is being combined with drugs from Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and Roche (RHHBY). Bristol and Nektar are looking at five tumor types. Roche and Nektar are working in lung and bladder cancer.RELATED:How This Biotech Could Dethrone Oxycodone In Treating PainIs This Small Biotech Headed For A $1 Billion Market Cap — Or A Pitfall?Bristol-Incyte Match Beats Dow's Merck In Combination Trials

71,LLY,"Biotechs, led by Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN), Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), outperformed their pharmaceutical brethren in the June quarter, an analyst says as earnings season nears a close.XLeerink analyst Geoffrey Porges  estimates that, of the large-cap biotechs, sales topped Wall Street expectations by an average 5% — with the most impressive beats coming from Alexion, Gilead, Vertex and Biogen (BIIB).Alexion's $912 million in sales topped the consensus by 8%. Gilead's hepatitis C unit fell again in the quarter, but total revenue of $7.14 billion topped by 13%. Vertex reported $544.14 million in sales, beating by 12%. Biogen topped by 10% with $3.1 billion in sales.""By comparison pharma company results were more tepid with Eli Lilly (LLY) and Merck (MRK) delivering significant revenue surprises, but otherwise fairly tepid results consisting of modest beat, in-line results and modest misses,"" Porges said in a note to clients last week.Dow-component Merck and Lilly topped the consensus by 4% and 2%, respectively. Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and Roche (RHHBY) delivered modest beats; Novartis (NVS), AstraZeneca (AZN) and Novo Nordisk (NVO) were in line. Sanofi (SNY), Pfizer (PFE) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) missed.On the earnings side, ""performance was even more robust in biotech,"" Porges said. Large-cap biotechs beat by an average 9.8%, relative to the consensus. Bigger pharmas delivered earnings that topped the consensus by an average 4.8%.Revenue growth vs. the year-earlier quarter was 10.5% for biotechs and 2.4% for drug firms, on average, Porges said. Across the board, companies reported improved patient-access to drugs, as well as positive demand, inventory and currency effects.IBD'S TAKE: Biotech fever looked chilly in late July. Can the sector overcome the challenges outlined in this IBD Industry Themes report?

72,LLY,"In the quarter, rare-disease players on the biotech side did particularly well, Brad Loncar, chief executive of Loncar Investments, told Investor's Business Daily. Biogen, Vertex and Sarepta Therapeutics (SRPT) all positively surprised the market.Spinraza, a treatment for spinal muscular atrophy from Biogen and Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS), nearly tripled consensus models. The drug brought in $203 million, obliterating views for $70 million, an analyst said.Sarepta absolutely crushed analyst expectations and rose to an eight-month high in July. Its key drug, Exondys 51, treats Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and brought in $13 million more than analysts had expected. Sarepta also cut loss-expectations by half.""I think that's one category of drugs where investors have been expecting payer pushback,"" Loncar said. ""And so far that hasn't shown up. If there was ever a group of companies that was going to boom more, it's rare-disease companies.""But sentiment has soured since the biotech sector hit an 18-month high in late July. Loncar cited political uncertainty, noting that the lion's share of biotechs and drugmakers with revenue-earning products beat expectations and raised guidance.""The fact they're not trading up (indicates that) investors have already reset their expectations for the year, so maybe it just hasn't been quite as impressive in that context,"" he said. ""We had a big run coming into earnings season, and that played a factor as well.""Uncertainty over tax reform is keeping most major players from looking to make big deals, Porges said. The Trump administration has yet to offer further details on its plan to cut the corporate tax rate to 15%, which would make corporate inversions less desirable.Though Gilead has been under the gun to buy something in the wake of slowing hepatitis C sales, it didn't comment on M&A on its second-quarter call. Dow's Pfizer says it's putting deals on pause while awaiting more on the tax situation out of Washington.Loncar noted Pfizer's call was the one that really ""crystalized"" this theme for the broader medtech sector. He had previously said a big deal in biotech could really send the stocks higher. But that looks unlikely in the near term.""Mega-deals might be on pause until that happens, or if that happens,"" he said. ""That's pretty disappointing. It shouldn't really affect what we call bolt-on deals. For the mega-deals, that seems to be holding things up.""RELATED:Gilead's Hepatitis C Franchise Topples Again, But Shares Are Up On BeatWill Pfizer's Cancer Drugs Help It Grow Without A Merger?This Biotech Just Blew Past Its Buy Point On A $13 Million Sales BeatAstraZeneca Beat, But Stock Dives On Drug Failure; 4 More ReportVertex Sings Late Despite Crushing Sales, Profit Expectations

73,LLY,"Eli Lilly (LLY) is gouging share from Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Novo Nordisk (NVO) in two classes of diabetes drugs, an analyst said Monday, though he suggested Lilly's second-quarter metrics would just meet consensus views.Prescription trends show Lilly's sales and earnings will be roughly in line with Wall Street views, Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez wrote in a note to clients. The consensus expects Lilly to report $1.04 in adjusted earnings per share on $5.59 billion in sales.But Fernandez upped his price target on Lilly stock to 93 from 90, noting that diabetes drugs Taltz and Trulicity are doing well. Meanwhile, Lilly's Jardiance and Trulicity are displacing drugs from Dow's J&J and Novo Nordisk in the SGLT-2 and GLP-1 classes of diabetes drugs, respectively.U.S. prescriptions of SGLT-2 diabetes drugs grew 17% year over year and 6% sequentially in the second quarter, Fernandez said. At the same time, prescriptions from the GLP-1 class of diabetes drugs grew 24% vs. the year-earlier period and 108% quarter over quarter.IBD'S TAKE: In the biotech space, Exelixis stock has popped 69% this year on its kidney cancer treatment. Head to The New America for a closer look at what catalysts are upcoming for this stock.In the SGLT-2 space, Lilly's Jardiance is taking share from J&J's Invokana. A study by J&J showed Invokana can reduce cardiovascular events in diabetes patients, but it also comes with a greater risk of amputation.The study ""validated the class' (cardiovascular) benefit,"" Fernandez said. But it also ""provided a clear tailwind to Lilly's Jardiance which saw accelerated growth in Q2 of 74% year over year and 19% sequential growth compared with 68% year-over-year and 14% sequential growth in Q1.""He expects Jardiance to overtake Invokana in the SGLT-2 class by 2021. The risk of amputation wasn't seen in a separate Jardiance trial by Lilly.Meanwhile, Trulicity is ""nipping at the heels of Novo Nordisk's Victoza with the latter's market share at 43% vs. Trulicity's 33%,"" Fernandez said. He expects Trulicity to overtake Victoza as the leader of the GLP-1 drug space in the 2018-19 time frame.Fernandez expects Novo Nordisk's overall diabetes business to decline 2% in 2017 and 4%-6% in 2018-20 as competition intensifies in the insulin arena. But he raised his estimates on Novo Nordisk's semaglutide, a competitor in the GLP-1 space.He has a market perform rating on Novo Nordisk stock, and outperform ratings on Lilly and Sanofi (SNY) stocks.Lilly stock ended Monday flat at 82.28. Novo Nordisk stock inched 0.3% higher to 42.12 on the stock market today.

76,LLY,"Shares of Alder Biopharmaceuticals (ALDR) on Tuesday lost more than a quarter of their value, diving to a low not seen since late 2014 despite positive data in a Phase 3 migraine trial, making it competitive with Eli Lilly (LLY), Amgen (AMGN) and Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA).Alder said its drug known as eptinezumab showed a statistically significant cut in frequent episodic migraines. During the first month, 31.5% and 30.8% of the patients on the 300-milligram and 100-milligram doses, respectively, of eptinezumab experienced a sizable reduction in roughly three-fourths of their monthly migraine days.But tests showed the psychosomatic ""placebo effect"" was nearly as effective, as it turned out. A total 20.3% who received nondrug placebos — and thought they may have received medication as part of the test group — also reported a three-fourths reduction in migraine days. That appeared to take a massive bite out of Alder shares.On the stock market today, Alder stock toppled 27.9% to close at 13.48. Meanwhile, Lilly slipped 1.5% to 83.04, Amgen dropped 1.6% to 170.85 and Teva fell 2.4% to 32.16.Eptinezumab and drugs from Lilly, Amgen and Teva are called anti-CGRPs. They aim to reduce a peptide to cut down on migraines.On average, 1 in 5 patients on the 300-milligram dose had no migraines in any given month over a six-month period, Alder said in a news release. That compares with a 2%-4% migraine-free rate in patients treated with Amgen's erenumab, in a separate study.Alder's drug also appeared to be fairly speedy. More than half of patients treated with eptinezumab had no migraines on Day Two vs. just 37% for patients who received the nondrug placebo.IBD'S TAKE: Alder stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 19, meaning it underperforms more than 8 in 10 stocks in terms of key growth rates. It trails stronger biotechs like Celgene which has a best-possible CR of 99. Visit IBD Stock Checkup for the best ideas in biotech.Leerink analyst Paul Matteis says the results put Alder in line with Lilly, Amgen and Teva. The results also indicate that the 300-milligram dose is stronger. Alder now has to decide whether to use intramuscular or subcutaneous administration.""Management has noted that the needle size for its (intramuscular shot) is smaller than a flu shot,"" he said in a note to clients. ""Though investors today are more familiar and therefore more comfortable with the concept of (subcutaneous shots).""Matteis kept his outperform rating on Alder stock. He noted, though, Alder didn't say much about safety other than the safety profile of eptinezumab appeared consistent with the placebo and earlier studies.RELATED:How This Small Biotech Could Ruffle The Market In Migraine DrugsTeva Pharma Ran A Migraine Trial — And Lilly, Amgen BenefitedCan Teva Hold Its Own In Bringing Migraine Drugs To Market?

77,LLY,"Merck's (MRK) Keytruda continued to gain share over immuno-oncology drugs from Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and Roche (RHHBY) in May after the approval of its Keytruda-plus-chemotherapy combination.Overall immuno-oncology drug sales grew 18% month over month in May to $602 million, data from Symphony Health show. Merck's Keytruda is gaining share at the expense of Bristol's Opdivo and Yervoy, Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez says.Keytruda share increased 1 percentage point to 28% as Opdivo and Yervoy shares fell to 49% and 16%, respectively, from a combined 72% at the end of 2016. Roche's drug, Tecentriq, remains steady at a 7% share after one year on the market.Tecentriq differs from Keytruda and Opdivo in that it targets the PD-L1 protein vs. the PD-1 protein targeted by Merck's and Bristol's drugs. Pfizer's (PFE) Bavencio and AstraZeneca's (AZN) Imfinzi are also anti-PD-L1 antibodies.Bavencio and Imfinzi are newest to the market and ""have achieved only a nominal share in their third and first months, respectively, following approval,"" Fernandez wrote in a note to clients.IBD'S TAKE: In other immuno-oncology news, Kite Pharma (KITE) and Bluebird Bio (BLUE) stocks have rocketed this month following the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting in Chicago. Head to the Industry Snapshot for a deep dive.Fernandez expects Keytruda to keep gaining share following its approval in advanced lung cancer in combination with Alimta from Eli Lilly (LLY). Keytruda also received recent approvals in bladder cancer and in some tumors.Evercore analyst Umer Raffat says Keytruda is tracking toward analyst projections for $485 million in sales in the second quarter. If June sales are up 14% month over month, Keytruda is likely to beat those expectations, Raffat wrote in a note to clients.On the stock market today, Merck, a component of the Dow Jones industrial average, was up 1.4% to close at 65.46, as shares of Bristol rose 0.7% to 56.07.

78,LLY,"Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) diabetes drug, Invokana, cut down on cardiovascular events during a long-term study — but Eli Lilly (LLY) stands to benefit most as doctors steer clear of the medication on worries it increased the risk of amputation.The study, dubbed Canvas, was presented late Monday. In it, Dow stock Johnson & Johnson said Invokana reduced the risk of cardiovascular death, nonfatal heart attack and nonfatal stroke by 14% vs. a non-drug placebo.Additional analysis showed that Invokana lowered the risk of hospitalization for heart failure by 33%. Invokana also delayed the progression of albuminuria — the presence of a specific chemical in the urine indicating kidney disease.RBC analyst Glenn Novarro says the Canvas study is unlikely to reverse the negative trajectory of Invokana sales. In the first quarter, Invokana and Invokamet sales dropped 17% year over year. For 2017, Novarro forecasts a 6% dip in sales to $1.2 billion.Eli Lilly, on the other hand, will benefit from Johnson & Johnson's study as Merck (MRK) trails, analysts say. Lilly's Jardiance is a SGLT2 inhibitor, which works by helping the kidneys to lower blood glucose levels. Merck's Januvia is a DPP-4, which blocks glucagon release, triggering insulin secretion.""Validated cardiovascular benefits should boost the SGLT2 class,"" Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan wrote. In a similar study, Lilly's Jardiance also showed a 14% benefit on cardiovascular outcomes. Jardiance also cut the risk of cardiovascular death and all mortality.Even without the Canvas study, Lilly was poised to grab a chunk of Invokana's sales after the Food and Drug Administration required Johnson & Johnson to warn physicians of the potential for amputation associated with Invokana. Invokana doubled the risk of amputation in a recent study.Experts cited by Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez say the amputation worry could be the ""biggest differentiating factor"" in physicians' decision to prescribe Jardiance over Invokana, as both show a similar cardiovascular benefit in diabetes patients.At the close on the stock market today, Johnson & Johnson stock ticked up 0.2% to finish the regular trading session at 132.02. Lilly stock added 0.4% to 81.25 and shares of diabetes drugmaker Merck dipped 1% to end the day at 63.27.IBD'S TAKE: Johnson & Johnson stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 77, meaning it outperforms more than three-quarters of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. For more of IBD's ratings visit IBD Stock Checkup.Meanwhile, the DPP-4 class of diabetes drugs, which includes Merck's Januvia, could face incremental pressure, Credit Suisse's Divan said.""Over time, however, we expect the enthusiastic response to the Canvas efficacy data driving use of the SGLT2 class earlier in the course of treatment, while concurrently pushing the DPP-4s further back,"" he said in a note to clients.Merck and Pfizer (PFE), a Dow stock, are jointly working on an SGLT2 inhibitor called ertugliflozin. Regulators could approve the drug in December, but it won't have data on cardiovascular outcomes for several years. Pfizer will take a chunk of those sales, meaning a shift from Januvia to ertugliflozin will be a net negative for Merck.RELATED:Lilly Could Grab Diabetes Share From Dow's J&J On Amputation WoesAbbVie Expects Rivals To Chip Away At Its Biggest Drug FranchiseDow's Pfizer Faces Challenges As Roche, J&J, Lilly Loom

79,LLY,"Wall Street is undervaluing Alder Biopharmaceuticals (ALDR) which stands to outperform larger rivals Amgen (AMGN), Eli Lilly (LLY) and Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) in migraine drugs, an analyst said Thursday ahead of a key conference on headache treatments.Needham analyst Danielle Brill maintained her buy rating and 36 price target on Alder stock. On the stock market today, Alder stock climbed 1.2% to 16.55. Alder is set to present data this weekend from a Phase 2 clinical trial of a treatment for frequent episodic migraines. Phase 3 data from the trial dubbed Promise-1 is expected by the end of the month.Brill expects Alder's drug, eptinezumab, to achieve a statistically significant reduction in migraine days vs. a placebo, in line with earlier results from Amgen, Lilly and Teva. All four are working on a class of drugs called anti-CGRPs which aim to reduce a peptide in order to cut down on migraines.""In our view, a placebo-adjusted difference in the one- to two-day range would be in line with competition,"" Brill wrote in a note to clients. ""But we acknowledge that subtle differences across trials make direct comparison difficult.""Alder could differentiate itself, though, by reducing migraine days at week 4 and week 12 by at least 75%. To date, no competitors have hit that goal, Brill said. But Alder's drug hit that point for 24% of patients in an earlier Phase 2 trial.""We expect a similar magnitude in Promise-1,"" Brill said.IBD'S TAKE: Alder stock has a low IBD Composite Rating of 11, meaning it underperforms nearly nine in 10 stocks in terms of key growth metrics. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a list of the top performers in the 431-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group.The trial tested 800 patients who experience at least 14 headache days a month, including at least four migraine days. Patients received each quarter varying doses of eptinezumab intravenously, with the main goal of reducing migraine days over weeks 1-12.Results from the first two dose types by week 24 are expected to be presented at a meeting of headache treatment specialists this weekend and early next week in Boston. Alder is scheduled for poster presentations Friday and an oral presentation Saturday.Alder said in a news release that it plans to present the results of a second Phase 3 trial before filing an application with the Food and Drug Administration in the second half of 2018.Brill sees room for multiple players in the migraine market. The consensus, though, sees Alder's drug taking just 63,000 patients in 2027, less than 1% of the estimated 7.1 million prevention-therapy candidates. Just 15% of the population could drive $1 billion in sales for Alder, she said.""While we look for Promise-1 results which support commercial differentiation, we think a positive trial with comparable findings to competitors is still a win,"" she wrote. ""We continue to believe the market is vast, and a subset of patients will warrant treatment with quarterly IV therapy over self-administered injections.""RELATED:Teva Pharma Ran A Migraine Trial — And Lilly, Amgen BenefitedCan Teva Hold Its Own In Bringing Migraine Drugs To Market?Biotechs Cruise On 6-Day Upswing Despite Price Target Cut For This Duo

80,LLY,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) went to the ""heart of the debate"" on Tuesday, questioning the validity of Amgen's (AMGN) patent on its LDL cholesterol-busting drug, Repatha, an analyst said following a court hearing.But Wall Street was split Wednesday on where the appeals court process would land. Analysts from investment bank Evercore expect Regeneron and Sanofi (SNY) to triumph, whereas a counterpart from Mizuho says there's a 55% chance of Amgen succeeding.On the stock market today, Regeneron rose 0.9% to 482. Amgen climbed 1.3% to 161.66. Shares of Regeneron partner Sanofi were down 1.75% to 48.34.On Tuesday, Regeneron and Amgen battled it out in a 45-minute appeals court hearing. At stake is the fate of Regeneron/Sanofi's drug, Praluent. A judge previously sided with Amgen, saying Regeneron/Sanofi's Praluent infringed Amgen's patent on the drug Repatha.The judge stayed an injunction on Praluent pending the appeals court process. But this is likely the end of the line if the appeals court sides with Amgen, Mizuho analyst Salim Syed said in a note to clients. The Supreme Court takes on very few patent cases.This decision will have broad implications for future patent struggles, Evercore analyst Umer Raffat said in an audio recording following the meeting. Amgen's patent covers an entire antigen, describing where it binds. Regeneron says this is too broad.""What Regeneron did was they went to the heart of the debate. They said, 'You know what? This patent shouldn't be valid to begin with,'"" he said. ""All Regeneron is saying is (Amgen's) patent should focus on what the invention is, not what it does.""Amgen says Praluent is too similar to its drug Repatha. If antibody patents can be circumvented by ""tweaking an amino acid,"" then there's no point in investing $2 billion in drug development if the return won't be realized, Syed said.IBD'S TAKE: Bioverativ (BIVV), a Biogen (BIIB) spinoff, has a three-year average return growth rate of 196%. See why it could be a smart investment by visiting IBD Stock Analysis.Regeneron noted Dow's Pfizer (PFE), at one time, tried unsuccessfully to develop a similar drug, also belonging to the PCSK9 inhibitor class. If Pfizer held all the intellectual property on PCSK9 inhibitors, neither Repatha nor Praluent would exist.""This example illustrates that even if similar, antibodies are different,"" Syed said. Raffat noted in his report Eli Lilly (LLY) and several others filed a brief in support of Regeneron.It's important to note if Praluent is booted from the market, Amgen's Repatha would be the sole PCSK9 inhibitor on the market. So the case will boil down to policy vs. emotions, Syed said.""If Amgen wins and Praluent is taken off the market, there could be pushback about only having one PCSK9 in the market and lessened competition,"" he said. ""If Praluent was to beat the injunction, that could signal that patents are not as relevant as one may think.""So the judges really seem to be considering the ""ramifications"" of their decision, Evercore analyst Akash Tewari said in the recording. Amgen's strategy of patenting an antigen — broader than an antibody — has yet to be tested in court.RELATED:Regeneron, Sanofi Undercut Amgen, AbbVie In Rheumatoid ArthritisTeva Pharma Ran A Migraine Trial — And Lilly, Amgen BenefitedHow Two Biotechs Fell On Cancer Partnerships With Bristol-Myers

81,LLY,"Roche (RHHBY) could displace Dow's Pfizer (PFE) in one segment of the lung cancer market, an analyst said Wednesday after the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting highlighted ""additional challenges"" for Pfizer.But on the stock market today, Pfizer fell 0.2% to 32 and Roche 0.4% to 32.09. Late Tuesday, Roche presented data from a head-to-head trial of its drug Alecensa vs. Pfizer's Xalkori.Xalkori was approved in 2011 to treat patients with advanced lung cancer and a specific genetic defect. Alecensa was approved in 2015 for lung cancer patients who progressed on or are intolerant to Xalkori. Both belong to a class of drugs called ALK inhibitors.After 18 months of follow-up, patients treated with Alecensa survived a median 25.7 months without their disease progressing vs. 10.4 months for patients treated with Xalkori.The presenter called Roche's results ""remarkable"" and ""outstanding,"" and ""declared that Alecensa is now the optimal ALK inhibitor for the first-line setting,"" Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan said in a note to clients. First-line treatments are the first defense against a disease.""One of the lung cancer doctors we had breakfast with yesterday also acknowledged that Xalkori is a relatively weak ALK inhibitor and she was likely to change her practice patterns based on (the trial),"" he wrote.Divan noted Pfizer is working on a next-generation ALK inhibitor that could help soften the blow of lost Xalkori sales. Also in lung cancer, Pfizer is developing a second-generation drug that targets a specific receptor, known as an EGFR inhibitor.IBD'S TAKE: Biogen (BIIB) spinoff Bioverativ (BIVV) could be nearing a stock breakout after announcing its plan to beef up its pipeline with the acquisition of True North Therapeutics. Head to IBD Stock Analysis for a closer look at Bioverativ's setup.But Pfizer is still struggling vs. newer therapies, particularly those that are considered immuno-oncology drugs. This class aims to block certain interactions involving proteins and enzymes in the immune system that would prevent an immune response.Pfizer's drug, Bavencio, is approved to treat a rare and aggressive skin cancer. Bavencio has shown strong results in liver cancer when combined with Inlyta, Pfizer's liver cancer drug. That should help slow the decline of revenue from Inlyta, Divan said.And though the class of breast cancer drugs known as CDK4/6 inhibitors is about to get more crowded, Pfizer's Ibrance will continue to dominate, Divan said. Though he acknowledged Novartis' (NVS) Kisqali and Eli Lilly's (LLY) abemaciclib have shown strong trial results.In prostate cancer, Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) Zytiga will put some pressure on Xtandi, a similar drug Pfizer acquired when it bought Medivation.RELATED:Will Regeneron's Cholesterol-Buster Get Booted In Amgen Battle?Tesaro Crashes Despite Beating AstraZeneca With 'Stronger' DataHow Clovis, AstraZeneca Could 'Muddy' A Potential Deal For Tesaro

82,LLY,"Wall Street is undervaluing the foundation Dow component Merck (MRK) is making with its cancer-fighting drug Keytruda, an analyst said as the annual American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting concluded Tuesday.A veritable star in the growing immuno-oncology market, Keytruda is now approved in the U.S. as a treatment for six cancers, according to its website. And Merck has about 40 ongoing studies that could help expand its approvals, Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan said in a note to clients.The drug ""can continue to drive the story in a company where we acknowledge the base business is facing pressure and where the non-oncology pipeline is not as robust as we would prefer,"" he wrote.For all its hype, Keytruda isn't Merck's biggest drug — Januvia/Janumet is. But sales of the diabetes drug fell 5% year over year in the first quarter whereas Keytruda revenue grew 134%, leading growth for the company.Keytruda recently grabbed Food and Drug Administration approval for use in conjunction with Eli Lilly's (LLY) Alimta as a first line of defense against advanced lung cancer.IBD'S TAKE: Incyte has been in the headlines this year despite the mixed outlook for the 2017 biotech sector. Get some insight into the company with The New America.Competitive data from the likes of rivals AstraZeneca (AZN), Roche (RHHBY) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) are unlikely to rock the boat for Merck, Divan said.""We believe people are underappreciating the impact the strong foundation Merck is building in the space,"" he said.Merck and its closest rival, Bristol, are also partnered separately with Incyte (INCY) to test out their drugs with Incyte's epacadostat. Keytruda and Bristol's Opdivo work to block an interaction involving the PD-1 protein that would prevent an immune system response to cancer.Incyte's epacadostat is what's known as an IDO inhibitor. It works to block an interaction involving a different protein. IDO inhibitors aren't as established as PD-1s, though they made some headlines at the conference. Bristol, too, is working on a similar drug.The ""totality of epacadostat data at ASCO looks compelling,"" Credit Suisse analyst Alethia Young wrote in a separate note to clients. Data supported epacadostat in multiple tumors, and responses were seen regardless of genetic markers.Shares of Incyte, though, toppled 1.4% to 122.27 on the stock market today. Young blamed the company's decision to exclude some patient data from effectiveness data but include them for safety. That's because effectiveness data had an October cutoff.""We would always like to see more data, but we think the data set presented at the meeting gave us confidence that we probably shouldn't expect significant variance from the unconfirmed patients,"" she wrote.Young models $3.6 billion in peak adjusted sales and $6.7 billion in peak unadjusted sales for epacadostat.Meanwhile, AstraZeneca remains confident in its immuno-oncology combos in advanced lung cancer despite ""dampened enthusiasm from investors"" for those specific matches. AstraZeneca is pairing its PD-L1 and CTLA-4 inhibitors in trials.The company also sees its drug Lynparza getting FDA approval as a second line of defense treatment against ovarian cancer. Lynparza is what's known as a PARP inhibitor, which blocks a family of enzymes cancer cells use to proliferate.In this sector, AstraZeneca rivals Clovis Oncology (CLVS) and Tesaro (TSRO).RELATED:Here Are Winners And Losers From Year's Biggest Cancer MeetingDow's Merck 'Clearly Won' Vs.

83,LLY,"Tesaro (TSRO) stock plunged Monday despite a Sunday presentation during the American Society for Clinical Oncology meeting that showed its Zejula could be stronger than drugs from AstraZeneca (AZN) in breast cancer.XOn the stock market today, Tesaro stock crashed 5.7% to end the day at 142.48 as shares of rivals AstraZeneca and Pfizer slipped less than 1%. Clovis Oncology (CLVS) and Eli Lilly (LLY) stocks also lost 1% or more.Tesaro and Dow component Merck (MRK) combined their drugs Zejula and Keytruda to treat ovarian and breast cancer patients. Zejula is what's known as a PARP inhibitor. Keytruda is a PD-1 inhibitor. Combining them is thought to offer a more potent response.Half of ovarian cancer patients responded to treatment ""which compares favorably to historical data from either PARP or PD-1 inhibitors alone in this patient population,"" Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez wrote in a note to clients.""While still early, this data appear stronger than the initial results seen with AstraZeneca's Lynparza plus Imfinzi in these tumor types,"" he wrote. Lynparza is a PARP inhibitor and Imfinzi is a PD-1 inhibitor.IBD'S TAKE: Tesaro stock has a middling IBD Composite Rating of 53, which measures the performance of stocks. Get IBD Stock Checkup for a look at better-rated biotechs.Three breast cancer patients had partial responses to the combo. All signs of cancer disappeared in one patient. And a patient with what is known as triple-negative breast cancer — a form that doesn't respond to normal treatments — achieved stability. The company also has seen promising, unconfirmed responses in other patients.In other presentations, AstraZeneca said its Lynparza showed a 2.8-month improvement in progression-free survival over chemotherapy in patients with some forms of breast cancer. But Pfizer showed similar data for its drug talazoparib on Saturday, Fernandez said.""Overall, Lynparza's less severe toxicity profile will likely drive use of the drug over chemotherapy,"" he said. ""The main adverse events associated with Lynparza were nausea and anemia. Neutropenia was the most common adverse event in the chemotherapy arm.""Lilly also presented ""incrementally positive but not groundbreaking"" data for its drug abemaciclib in some forms of breast cancer. Death rates were broadly in line with that of Pfizer's Ibrance. Diarrhea as a side effect was ""manageable,"" Lilly said.Abemaciclib belongs to a class of drugs called CDK4/6 inhibitors. It competes with Novartis' already approved Kisqali. But Lilly says its continuous dosing method of treatment could do more to disrupt cancer cell cycles.RELATED:Did AstraZeneca Rival Just Launch A Potential Blockbuster Drug?Bristol-Incyte Match Beats Dow's Merck In Combination TrialsHow Clovis, AstraZeneca Could 'Muddy' A Potential Deal For Tesaro

84,LLY,"Loxo Oncology (LOXO) stock defied a broad biotech dip Monday and spiked to a record high after showing its drug, larotrectinib, shrunk tumors in a number of different cancers.Shares of Loxo ended Monday's regular session catapulting higher by 43.2%, to 70.12, following the presentation Saturday during the American Society of Clinical Oncology annual meeting in Chicago. Companies like Eli Lilly (LLY), Merck (MRK), Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and Roche (RHHBY) were in attendance.Loxo's drug belongs to a class of immuno-oncology agents that aim to inhibit a family of proteins. Loxo is now setting up to begin a Phase 1 and 2 trial of larotrectinib after an adult with colon cancer and a child with a tissue tumor responded to treatment.But the big-cap names weren't the big winners on Wall Street. Instead, companies like Bluebird Bio (BLUE) surged. Bluebird stock got an 8.5% jump to 91.30 after it presented strong data for its drug, dubbed bb2121, for treating multiple myeloma.On Monday, Bluebird said all 15 patients in a trial of bb2121 responded to treatment with no relapses. The therapy was well-tolerated, Leerink analyst Michael Schmidt said in a report. He has an outperform rating on Bluebird stock.IBD'S TAKE: Supernus Pharmaceuticals (SUPN) stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 97 out of a best-possible 99 based on key growth metrics. It leads IBD's 431-company Biomed/Biotech industry group. Keep tabs on the industry leaders with IBD Stock Checkup.And Puma Biotechnology (PBYI) stock lifted 2.1%, at 83.65, after rival Roche unveiled the results of a yearlong test of its drugs in a specific group of breast cancer patients. The results were on the ""low end of investors' expectations,"" RBC analyst Matthew Eckler said.This bodes well for Puma, which is working on a drug called neratinib that could address the same group of patients, Eckler said. Roche drugs Herceptin and Perjeta were tested as an adjuvant treatment — treatments that are added to decrease the risk of relapse.""We now assume adoption of neratinib will be largely unencumbered by the adjuvant use of Herceptin plus Perjeta,"" Eckler wrote in a note to clients. He kept his sector perform rating on Puma stock, but boosted his price target to 88 from 60.However, Puma Bio shares closed well off its intraday high of 92, their highest since November 2015.TG Therapeutics (TGTX) stock also cut a wide berth Monday. It rose as much as 10.8%, but gave those gains back to close down 6.1%, at 13. Earlier in the day, TG had positive results of a trial with AbbVie (ABBV) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) in a form of leukemia.RELATED:Dow's Merck 'Clearly Won' Vs.

85,LLY,"Eli Lilly (LLY) and Amgen (AMGN) stocks got a boost Wednesday after rival Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) unveiled strong results of a Phase 3 trial in treating chronic migraines.On the stock market today, Lilly stock rose 1.6% to 79.57. Lilly, however, also benefited from a strong late-stage trial in advanced bladder cancer. Meanwhile, Amgen stock popped 0.9% to 155.24.But shares of Alder Biopharmaceuticals (ALDR), another player in migraine treatments, fell 4.05% to 15.40. Teva, which conducted the results, edged up 0.1% to 27.86.All four are working on anti-calcitonin gene-related peptides, known as anti-CGRPs, to tackle migraines. Mounting evidence has linked an increase in CGRPs to the onset of a migraine. Knocking down CGRPs is thought to prevent migraines.Teva is aiming to reduce migraines over monthly and quarterly periods with its drug known as fremanezumab. Alder already has a quarterly infusion for migraines. This could be important for competitive positioning, Evercore analyst Umer Raffat said.IBD'S TAKE: IBD's 17-company Generic-Drugs industry group is ranked No. 154 out of 197 groups tracked, trailing its sister industry groups Ethical Drugs and Biomed/Biotech, which are ranked Nos. 66 and 46, respectively. For a closer look at the industry layout, visit IBD's Biotech And Pharma Industry And Stock News page.""Amgen and Lilly never developed their antibodies for quarterly dosing,"" he said. ""Recall (that the drug from) Teva also has a longer half-life than all competitors.""The half-life is how long it takes for the amount of drug in the body to be reduced by 50%.In a Phase 3 study of patients with chronic migraines, Teva's drug cut monthly headache days of at least moderate severity by 4.6 days. Over a quarter, the drug reduced headache days by 4.3 days.But making an apples-to-apples comparison is difficult, Raffat wrote in a note to clients. In a separate study of chronic migraine patients, Lilly's drug showed a 2.7-day reduction in monthly migraine days, not just moderate to severe headaches.RELATED:Teva Pharma, Eagle Pharma, Depomed Among Slew Getting Price HaircutsDid Neurocrine Just Leave The Door Open For Teva In Tourette's?Can Teva Hold Its Own In Bringing Migraine Drugs To Market?

87,LLY,"Clovis Oncology (CLVS) and Tesaro (TSRO) could each deliver blockbuster ovarian cancer drugs and grab takeover interest, an analyst said Friday ahead of a key trial for Clovis, expected later this month.The duo rivals bigger AstraZeneca (AZN), whose $87.3 billion market cap is more than eight times that of Clovis and Tesaro combined. Clovis and Tesaro joined AstraZeneca on the PARP-inhibitor market within the last year.PARP inhibitors work by blocking a family of enzymes that cancer cells use to proliferate. Pfizer (PFE) and AbbVie (ABBV) are also working on PARP inhibitors. Credit Suisse analyst Alethia Young sees the class of drugs also having an impact in prostate, breast and lung cancers.""We think that the PARP (inhibitor) market is big enough ($8 billion to $10 billion) that Clovis can have a blockbuster product as well,"" she wrote. ""We strongly believe that both companies are likely attractive targets for large global biopharma companies.""Later this month, Clovis is expected to unveil the results of its Phase 3 trial, dubbed Ariel-3, for its drug Rubraca. Tesaro previously set a high bar with a trial of its drug Zejula which had a benefit in all patients regardless of specific genetics.""On a top-line basis, we think Ariel-3 will work across the groups, but the focus will be on potential commercial differences like use of biomarker and safety,"" she wrote in a note to clients.Young expects Tesaro stock to be volatile following Clovis' trial, but notes that it will lift an overhang on shares. She has outperform ratings on both Tesaro and Clovis stocks. She rates Tesaro stock with a 198 price target and Clovis with an 88 price target, up from 74.On the stock market today, Clovis stock rose 0.45% to 59.97. Tesaro stock gained 0.1% to 144.31. AstraZeneca, Pfizer and AbbVie stocks were up 1.4%, 0.5% and 0.6%, respectively.IBD'S TAKE: The American Society of Clinical Oncology laid out the battlefield fighting cancer. Companies like Merck, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Incyte and Roche are working on combining drugs on the immuno-oncology spectrum. Get more at IBD Industry Themes.Shares of fellow cancer biotech Incyte (INCY) toppled 1.9% to 118.05, after sustaining a price-target cut. Leerink analyst Michael Schmidt trimmed his price target on Incyte stock to 129 from 134 after Incyte and Eli Lilly's (LLY) rheumatoid arthritis treatment was delayed in the U.S.In April, the Food and Drug Administration delayed approval for the drug, called baricitinib, instead asking for more information into a trial. Now, Schmidt says he expects $400 million in 2026 sales, down from $1.3 billion. He sees the drug launching in 2020.But, Schmidt was bullish on Seattle Genetics (SGEN) stock after the small biotech and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) unveiled strong data for a combination of their drugs Adcetris and Opdivo in classical Hodgkin lymphoma. All signs of cancer disappeared in 63% of patients.A series of trials for the combination could ""potentially provide a chemotherapy-free treatment option"" for patients whose Hodgkin lymphoma either relapsed or can't be treated with surgery.Schmidt has outperform ratings on Seattle Genetics and Bristol-Myers stocks.RELATED:Tesaro Crashes Despite Beating AstraZeneca With 'Stronger' DataBristol-Incyte Match Beats Dow's Merck In Combination TrialsConference Spotlights Drug Giant Donnybrooks In Cancer Treatments

88,LLY,"Veeva Systems (VEEV) stock rushed to a record high Friday after the IBD 50 software firm reported what one analyst called ""another exceptional quarter"" and issued Street-topping guidance.On the stock market today, Veeva stock was up 8,2%, near 66.825, after rising as much as 10% in earlier trading. Shares have run up more than 50% for the year on an uptrend in software, Canaccord Genuity analyst Richard Davis said in a report.""Software valuations are moving toward leptokurtic distributions, which is another way of saying that valuations have fat tails of winners and losers,"" he said. ""And in case you missed it, Veeva is decisively in the winner's bucket.""Veeva belongs to IBD's 18-company Computer Software-Medical industry group, which is up 28% since January. Veeva makes the software backbone for the biggest names in pharma including Eli Lilly (LLY), Novartis (NVS), Pfizer (PFE) and Amgen (AMGN).But now Veeva is looking to expand outside the life sciences market and has ""essentially greenfield opportunities in other regulated industries outside life sciences with QualityOne,"" a next-generation version of the Vault software that it uses to organize clinical trial data.IBD'S TAKE: Veeva is looking for growth outside of life sciences. Visit The New America for an exclusive chat with Chief Executive Peter Gassner on what that new initiative might look like.Still, Veeva added nearly 30 new customers to its Vault offering in the first quarter, and a top-50 pharma began standardizing on Veeva CRM (customer relationship management) software, Chief Executive Peter Gassner said on a late Thursday call with analysts.The number of customers with multiple Vault products — there are 14 — increased more than 70% year over year in the quarter. That included a top-20 pharma that added Vault RIM and Vault QualityDocs in a big deal, Gassner said.""This is exciting as it represents a top-20 pharma going all in with Vault,"" he said.

89,LLY,"Novo Nordisk (NVO) stock popped Tuesday after AstraZeneca (AZN) said its type 2 diabetes drug didn't reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in a trial, leaving Eli Lilly (LLY) to break the tie in 2019.On the stock market today, Novo Nordisk fell 2 cents to 41.48, while AstraZeneca was up 0.4% to 34.08. Shares of Lilly, a diabetes rival, were up 1.3% to 77.99.AstraZeneca's drug Bydureon met its goal in a Phase 3 study. It did not increase the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events, including heart attack and stroke, in patients with type 2 diabetes — meeting a Food and Drug Administration requirement.But it also didn't reduce the risk, as Novo Nordisk's Victoza and semaglutide did in earlier studies. Victoza cut the risk of cardiovascular events by 13%. Semaglutide trimmed the risk by 26%, Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez wrote in a note to clients.These drugs could also have a cardiovascular benefit, Evercore analyst Umer Raffat said in a note to clients. So far, AstraZeneca's Bydureon and Sanofi's (SNY) Adlyxin failed to cut the risk of cardiovascular events, but Novo Nordisk's two drugs have.IBD'S TAKE: AstraZeneca has an IBD Composite Rating of 80, meaning it has outperformed eight in 10 stocks in key growth metrics over the past 12 months. But it still lags leader Zoetis (ZTS), which has a CR of 92 out of a best-possible 99. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a list of the top-rated drugmakers.Lilly will provide the tiebreaker in 2019 when it unveils the results of a trial of diabetes drug Trulicity. Like drugs from AstraZeneca, Novo Nordisk and Sanofi, Trulicity belongs to a class of drugs that increase insulin secretion while inhibiting glucose release at certain levels.Fernandez forecasts the entire class of drugs growing to $9 billion in worldwide sales by 2021, up from $5 billion in 2016.In the meantime, Novo's drugs will maintain their leadership position in the class, dubbed GLP-1 receptor agonists, Fernandez said. The class is underused in diabetes treatment, though a positive heart effect in AstraZeneca's trial could have boosted their prominence.Though ""Lilly's Trulicity (is) gaining share in the GLP-1 class,"" he said, ""Novo counts on (the) once-weekly semaglutide launch to stem the tide.""Novo could also benefit from an update to the label on Victoza, reflecting the drug's ability to curb the risk of cardiovascular events in diabetes patients.RELATED:Conference Spotlights Drug Giant Donnybrooks In Cancer TreatmentLilly Could Grab Diabetes Share From Dow's J&J On Amputation WoesDow's Pfizer, Eli Lilly Topple To 3-Month Lows On Downgrades

Shares of both hit lows last seen in mid-February.Goldman Sachs analyst Jami Rubin removed Lilly from her conviction list, replacing it with IBD 50 member Edwards Lifesciences (EW), ""another product story where we see potential for more upside."" But Lilly stock is still rated buy with a 92 price target.Lilly stock is up 9% year to date vs. the S&P 500, which has risen 7%. Though long-term fundamentals look strong, Lilly is facing near-term risk from a patent battle regarding chemotherapy Alimta. That decision is expected June 3.""It is a unique situation in that Lilly has already won at the District Court and appeals in the U.S. against the same patent,"" Rubin said. ""Usually (the district court) process follows (a patent review).""The likelihood of Lilly losing in the patent review process is low, but could result in earlier-than-expected generic competition vs. Alimta in the U.S. by the second half of 2018, Rubin wrote in a note to clients.Meanwhile, a Food and Drug Administration decision regarding rheumatoid arthritis drug Olumiant is weighing on Lilly stock, she wrote. Earlier this year, the FDA asked for more dosing and safety data on the drug, just two months after European officials signed off on it.IBD'S TAKE: Lilly has a middling IBD Composite Rating of 59, out of a best-possible 99, meaning it outperforms nearly six in 10 stocks in terms of key growth metrics. But it still lags the leader, Zoetis, with a CR of 91. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a list of the top-performing drugmakers.Longer-term, Rubin sees upside from diabetes drug Trulicity, breast cancer drug abemaciclib and migraine drug galcanezumab — though ""it could take time before Lilly gets credit"" for those on Wall Street, Rubin said.Pfizer, on the other hand, was cut to a sell rating from neutral at Citi, and its price target cut to 31 from 38. According to StreetInsider, Citi said Medicare Part D coverage of some of Pfizer's oncology drugs is at risk.Among those, Pfizer counts prostate cancer drug Xtandi, breast cancer drug Ibrance and lung cancer drug Xalkori.Citi analyst Andrew Baum says Pfizer, a member of the Dow Jones industrial average, needs a deal to hit the consensus' view toward profits.

91,LLY,"Eli Lilly's (LLY) Jardiance will likely benefit most after the Food and Drug Administration required Dow component Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) to warn patients of leg and foot amputations associated with diabetes drug Invokana, an analyst said Tuesday.In a letter to physicians Tuesday, the FDA cited two large clinical trials and concluded that diabetes meds Invokana, Invokamet and Invokamet XR ""causes an increased risk of leg and foot amputations.""The FDA will now require Johnson & Johnson to add a boxed warning to its Invokana/Invokamet labels. The trials, dubbed Canvas and Canvas-R, showed that leg and foot amputations occurred twice as often in patients treated with Invokana vs. a placebo.""Amputations to the toe and middle of the foot were the most common, however, amputations involving the leg, below and above the knee also occurred,"" the FDA wrote. ""Some patients had more than one amputation, some involving both limbs.""Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez expects Lilly to benefit from an influx of Invokana patients transitioning to one of its diabetes meds, Jardiance. Invokana and Jardiance belong to a class of drugs called SGLT2 inhibitors.SGLT2 — sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 — is a protein that facilitates glucose reabsorption in the kidneys. These drugs block the reabsorption of glucose in the kidneys, increase glucose excretion and lower blood glucose levels.""The increasingly differentiated labels and data to date suggest that Lilly's Jardiance likely will be a near-term beneficiary of further and perhaps accelerated market share losses for Invokana,"" Fernandez wrote in a note to clients.IBD'S TAKE: Stay on top of the biotech and drug industry by bookmarking IBD's Biotech And Pharma Industry And Stock News page.Whether physicians move their patients off Invokana and onto Jardiance or AstraZeneca's (AZN) Farxiga will likely depend on the full results of the Canvas and Canvas-R trials to be presented in June during the American Diabetes Association meeting.J&J's Janssen subsidiary began the Canvas trial in December 2009 to examine the potential cardiovascular benefit of Invokana. The Canvas-R trial began in October 2013. Researchers examined benefits of Invokana on the kidneys.Lilly's Jardiance was approved by the FDA in December to cut the risk of cardiovascular death in adults with Type 2 diabetes. Jardiance was the first Type 2 diabetes drug to get approval for cutting the risk of cardiovascular death.""We believe a dramatic impact on the class is unlikely in the wake of Jardiance's cardiovascular death claim and could be further mitigated by directionally positive results in Canvas/Canvas-R on efficacy/cardiovascular risk reduction,"" Fernandez wrote.Still, the entire SGLT2 needs to grow for Jardiance to meet or beat forecasts. Fernandez sees $665 million in U.S. Jardiance sales in 2017 and $1 billion in Invokana sales in 2017. He forecasts the entire class growing to $4 billion in 2021 from $2.1 billion this year.""So even if Jardiance were to capture 100% of Invokana's estimates sales of $1 billion in 2017 in the immediate future, a major slowdown in category growth likely would be a bigger issue relative to consensus estimates,"" he said.At the close on the stock market today, Lilly stock was down 1.6% to 78.99, after a Goldman Sachs analyst removed the stock from her conviction list. But shares of J&J, a member of the Dow Jones industrial average, advanced 0.6%, near 127.77.RELATED:Dow's Pfizer, Eli Lilly Topple To 3-Month Lows On DowngradesCan Teva Hold Its Own In Bringing Migraine Drugs To Market?Drug Stocks Rally On Relief After GOP Health Bill Wins In House

92,LLY,"Eli Lilly (LLY), Pfizer (PFE) and Novartis (NVS) are pitted in the battle to treat breast cancer, but Wall Street struggled Thursday to compare the effectiveness of their drugs after Lilly unveiled new data.All three drugs belong to a class called CDK4/6, which work to inhibit specific proteins to prevent the over-proliferation of cancer cells. Pfizer's Ibrance was the first approved in this area. But Novartis' Kisqali grabbed approval this year and Lilly's abemaciclib looks promising.In a Phase 2 trial, Lilly's abemaciclib, combined with chemotherapy, increased progression-free survival to a median 16.4 months vs. 9.3 months for a placebo-chemo combo. Hazard ratio, which measures the likelihood of death, was 0.55.Pfizer's drug Ibrance was combined with chemo in an earlier trial. The combo had a lower hazard ratio at 0.46 — meaning there was a lower risk of death — but it only extended progression-free survival to a median 9.5 months vs. 4.6 months in placebo combo.Comparing the two boils down to which Wall Street sees as a ""better"" effectiveness metric, Evercore analyst Umer Raffat wrote in a report. He notes that the trials studied different populations of breast cancer patients, making an apples-to-apples comparison tricky.Still, diarrhea remains a concern for Lilly's abemaciclib — 86.4% of patients experienced diarrhea vs. 24.7% of patients on the placebo-chemo combination. Lilly advises patients to begin an anti-diarrheal medicine at the first sign of diarrhea.IBD'S TAKE: Want to keep tabs on the market during the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting next month? Bookmark IBD's Biotech And Pharma Industry And Stock News page.The results were presented late Wednesday ahead of the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting in June in Chicago. Other abstracts uploaded Wednesday include those from Merck (MRK), Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), Roche (RHHBY), Tesaro (TSRO), Regeneron (REGN) and Sanofi (SNY).Incyte (INCY) stock spiked to a month-high Thursday after its epacadostat proved effective in combos with Merck's Keytruda and Bristol's Opdivo, outdoing Roche's Tecentriq with NewLink Genetics' (NLNK) rival to epacadostat.But that wasn't Merck's only note of interest. Merck also offered a pair of updates in its ""famous"" trial, dubbed Keynote-024, which has found that Keytruda is better than chemo as a first treatment for advanced lung cancer.The hazard ratio for Keytruda dropped to 0.69 from 0.9, Merck said. Although this is ""not statistically significant, the favorable trend may have helped them in recent FDA approval,"" Evercore's Raffat said in a note.Merck's Keytruda and Bristol's Opdivo are what's known as immuno-oncology drugs. They work to block the interaction between a PD-1 protein on an immune system cell and a PD-L1 protein on a cancer cell to help the immune system identify the cancer.In its Keynote-024 trial, Merck also found lung-cancer patients treated with Keytruda in their initial round saw continued benefit from Keytruda in the second round if the cancer progressed. This cements ""the role for PD-1 (inhibitors) in first-line (treatment) even further,"" Raffat said.In a Phase 1 trial, Regeneron and Sanofi found their PD-1 drug, known as REGN-2810, had a benefit rate of 52% for patients with a common form of skin cancer. The drug had a 70% control rate, ""which is very encouraging in this disease setting,"" Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said.The American Cancer Society estimates that 5.4 million patients are diagnosed with and 20,000 die of basal and squamous cell skin cancers each year in the U.S. Longer term, there might be potential for REGN-2810 to treat patients with advanced, but not necessarily fatal, skin cancers.Of the 26 patients enrolled in Regeneron/Sanofi's trial, one showed a complete response of 19 months — meaning all discernible signs of cancer disappeared. Porges kept his outperform rating on Regeneron stock.Though there was ""little of note"" in Tesaro's abstract ahead of the conference, Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez says the most interesting data presented next month will be a combination trial of Tesaro's Zejula and Merck's Keytruda in breast and ovarian cancer.Zejula competes vs. AstraZeneca (AZN) and Clovis Oncology (CLVS) in a class of drugs called PARP inhibitors which works to block a specific enzyme to treat ovarian cancer. PARP inhibitors are currently being investigated in breast cancer as well.Combining a PARP inhibitor and an immuno-oncology drug like Merck's Keytruda is thought to be more potent in treating cancer. Tesaro is also looking at Zejula plus a PD-1, like Keytruda, in advanced lung cancer.The company is slated to present data from a dozen patients treated with Zejula and Keytruda. Fernandez notes that the bar is fairly low to outperform. Alone, PD-1 inhibitors have a 10%-15% response rate in this group of patients. PARP inhibitors have a mid-20% response rate.""Although recently published data from a small trial of AstraZeneca's Imfinzi (a PD-L1 inhibitor) plus Lynparza (a PARP inhibitor) showed a somewhat disappointing 17% response rate in 10 ovarian cancer patients, Tesaro believes the combination of a PD-1 antibody plus Zejula will be superior,"" Fernandez said.RELATED:Incyte Teams Up With Dow's Merck To Trounce Roche In CancerDid AstraZeneca Rival Just Launch A Potential Blockbuster Drug?

94,LLY,"Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) will square off with Eli Lilly (LLY), Amgen (AMGN), Novartis (NVS) and Alder Biopharmaceuticals (ALDR) next month when it unveils the results of a Phase 3 study in migraines.But it looks like rival Lilly might beat it to the market. On Friday, Lilly said its drug, galcanezumab, reduced monthly migraine days in a Phase 3 study of patients with chronic and episodic migraines. Lilly is planning to submit an application to the FDA later this year for approval of galcanezumab.Like Teva's fremanezumab and drugs from Alder and Amgen/Novartis, Lilly's galcanezumab is what's known as an anti-CGRP (calcitonin gene-related peptide). Studies indicate that subjects' saliva and plasma show a spike in CGRPs during migraine attacks. Blocking CGRPs is thought to stop an attack in its tracks.More than 30 million people suffer from migraines in the U.S., says Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez. He forecasts $6 billion to $7 billion for the entire anti-CGRP drug market, with Lilly taking $1 billion in global peak sales.""On the other hand, questions (remain) about the market opportunity, particularly given concern over potential payer headwinds as well as the intensity of competition,"" he wrote in a note to clients.IBD'S TAKE: Amgen is hanging some of its 2017 hopes on its anti-CGRP drug, erenumab. Head to IBD's Technology page for an exclusive interview with Chief Executive Robert Bradway in December, looking ahead to Amgen's pipeline in 2017.For Teva, migraine drug fremanezumab could be a catalyst or a bust, Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan wrote in a research report. Divan cut his price target on Teva stock to 39 from 42, though he kept his outperform rating on shares following the company's lackluster first-quarter report on Thursday.""We believe expectations are already relatively high, but strong data could help improve sentiment on the stock and potentially drive some upside,"" he said.Divan cut his expectations for 2017-19 adjusted earnings for Teva to a respective $4.94, $5.39 and $5.70, noting difficulties in the first quarter. Sales of $5.63 billion narrowly lagged the $5.63 billion view of analysts, though earnings beat by 3 cents.Specialty drugs, including multiple-sclerosis med Copaxone, declined 6% to $2 billion. That follows a patent battle with Mylan that wrapped in February with a judge declaring four key patents protecting Copaxone, Teva's biggest drug, invalid.On the stock market today, Teva stock fell 0.3% to 31.69.RELATED:Teva Pharma Q1 Sales Lag As Key Multiple Sclerosis Drug TopplesBiotechs Cruise On 6-Day Upswing Despite Price Target Cuts For This Duo
"
95,LLY,"Dow component Merck (MRK) now has a one- to two-year lead on its rivals in treating advanced lung cancer, an analyst said Thursday after the FDA approved the drug giant's Keytruda-chemo combo.Late Wednesday, the FDA had granted accelerated approval to Keytruda plus Eli Lilly's (LLY) chemotherapy Alimta and carboplatin, another chemo drug. The combination is approved for all patients regardless of whether their tumors have a lot of what is known as a PD-L1 protein, which exists on cancer cells.Keytruda works by blocking the interaction between a PD-L1 protein on the surface of a cancer cell and the PD-1 protein on an immune system cell. Doing so helps the immune system identify the camouflaged cancer.UBS analyst Marc Goodman sees Merck as having a one- to two-year lead in lung cancer over the likes of Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), AstraZeneca (AZN) and Roche (RHHBY). But other combo therapies from the likes of Bristol-Myers and AstraZeneca are on the horizon for 2017 and 2018. He has a buy rating and 70 price target on Merck stock.Merck's accelerated approval for Keytruda plus chemotherapy is contingent on a study confirming the strength of the treatment. Results from the confirmatory study, dubbed Keynote-189, are expected in September.""However, we believe this accelerated approval may be a tacit admission that the agency took an early peek at this study and the interim data were compelling,"" Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez said in a note. He has a market perform rating on Merck stock.On the stock market today, shares of Merck, a component of the Dow Jones industrial average, rose 0.8% to 64.43, after earlier rising as much as 2%. Shares of Bristol were unchanged while AstraZeneca and Roche edged up 0.3%.IBD'S TAKE: The immuno-oncology market is far from mature. Keep tabs on IBD's Biotech And Pharma Industry And Stock News page for the latest on the emerging sector.Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan expects the approval to expand Keytruda's market to 100,000 patients in the U.S. from 35,000. Keytruda is also approved as a first treatment and following chemo to treat lung cancer patients whose tumors have a lot of the PD-L1 protein.Studies have shown that patients whose tumors have a lot of the PD-L1 protein respond better to the type of therapy offered by Keytruda as well as Bristol's Opdivo. But in a study presented in October, Keytruda plus chemo improved overall survival rate by 55% in all patients regardless PD-L1 status.Adam Schechter, executive vice president and president of Merck's Global Human Health unit, expects physicians to think about the Keytruda-chemo combination differently in younger patients vs. older patients.""In addition to that, we believe that since we've studied the drug with Alimta, that early adoption will probably used where physicians would use Alimta,"" he said on Merck's first-quarter earnings conference call on May 2.But ""it's not a pent-up demand,"" he said. ""I would look at it as a build as new patients come into the market and I think that it really is (an) exciting opportunity for lung cancer patients, but also to establish Keytruda further as a real preferred treatment therapy.""Keytruda's approval with chemo regardless of PD-L1 status doesn't bode well for Bristol which is struggling amid increased competition. In lung cancer, Bristol's Opdivo is approved as a second-line treatment, meaning it's only prescribed after patients have undergone a round of chemo.Bristol is looking at Opdivo plus Yervoy in advanced lung cancer. Yervoy targets the CTLA-4 interaction between an immune cell and a cancer cell. AstraZeneca's Mystic study is looking at its Imfinzi, a PD-L1 antibody, with tremelimumab, a CTLA-4 antibody, in lung cancer.""Data readouts could change investor sentiment this year,"" UBS' Goodman wrote in a note. He assumes $2 billion and $3 billion in first-line lung cancer sales in the U.S. for Keytruda in 2018 and 2019, respectively. First-line means Keytruda can be prescribed before chemo.RELATED:Why Roche's Cancer Failure Might Tank Bristol, Pfizer — But Not MerckBristol-Myers 'Too Risky' To Acquire As Merck, Roche Pile On PressureDid Gilead Just Provide Some 'Incyte' Into A Potential Deal

96,LLY,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN), Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Biogen (BIIB) would benefit the most among biotechs under President Trump's proposed tax reform, a measure that would cut the corporate tax rate by 20%.Under Trump's proposal ""no business of any size, from a Fortune 500 to a mom-and-pop shop to a freelancer living job to job, will pay more than 15% of their business income in taxes,"" making corporate inversions unnecessary."" The U.S. corporate tax rate is currently 35%.That means Regeneron, Gilead and Biogen — all of which have guided to adjusted tax rates at or above 25% in 2017 — could see a serious boost in cash if Trump's proposal passes. Though, analysts say, it's all about compromise inside the Beltway, so that 15% rate is still up in the air.Trump's approval rating jumped to 39% in May from 34% in April, and he gained 7% in the IBD/TIPP Presidential Leadership Index after unveiling his tax reform proposal. It was the first month-over-month increase since Trump became president.But that doesn't mean Big Pharma and biotech are totally sold on Trump's proposal — a four-page document released April 26. Shares of biotechs and drugmakers collectively lifted less than 1% that day, though generic drug stocks popped 2.8%.Gilead Chief Executive John Milligan noted uncertainty in Washington is the norm.""So I think we've kind of learned to filter that out and focus on the things that are right for the company,"" he said on Gilead's May 2 first-quarter earnings conference call. ""There may be tax reform. There may be repatriation. But you can't count on it and you can't wait for it, either.""Trump's plan would slash the U.S. corporate tax rate to 15% from 35%, benefiting companies whose consolidated tax rates remain well above that level. Consolidating taxes allows a firm to treat a group of wholly- or majority-owned companies as a single entity for tax purposes.U.S.-domiciled drugmakers typically pay 37%-40% in consolidated taxes, Canaccord analyst Dewey Steadman told Investor's Business Daily. But companies that acquire a foreign firm can move their tax domicile outside the U.S. to the acquired company's often lower-tax homeland.When Mylan (MYL) acquired a generics manufacturer from Abbott Laboratories (ABT) in 2014, it kept its operational headquarters in Pennsylvania, but reincorporated in the Netherlands. In March, Mylan said it expected to pay a 16.5%-18.5% tax rate in 2017.Similarly, Allergan (AGN) guided in February to a 13.5% adjusted tax rate in 2017. Allergan's corporate headquarters are in Ireland. In April 2016, Pfizer (PFE) scrapped its $160 billion attempt to acquire Allergan a day after the U.S. Treasury unveiled new rules to curb inversions.Former President Barack Obama called global tax avoidance a ""huge problem"" and urged Congress to close the loophole for good. Trump, on the other hand, says his tax reform proposal would make inversions unnecessary ""by making America's tax rate one of the best in the world.""Regeneron, Gilead and Biogen would be among the biggest winners of this cut, Evercore analyst Umer Raffat said in an April 26 report. Regeneron has guided to an effective tax rate of 32%-38% in 2017. Gilead sees 25%-28%. In the first quarter, Biogen paid 23% in adjusted taxes.Among drugmakers, Pfizer, Eli Lilly (LLY), Merck (MRK) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) all guided to effective tax rates between 20%-25% for 2017. Canaccord's Steadman and Mizuho analyst Salim Syed told IBD everything in politics is subject to negotiation.""Smaller biotechs say it's obviously positive for the future, but everyone is taking a wait-and-see approach,"" Steadman said. ""A 20%-22% rate is probably what's going to happen, but they're not changing their capital expenditures or organizational structure in the meantime.""IBD'S TAKE: Looking for the latest on biotech and drug news? Be sure to bookmark IBD's Biotech And Pharma Industry And Stock News page.A second facet of Trump's plan would allow the one-time repatriation of corporate cash parked overseas at a discounted 10% tax rate. This would be followed by an end to the deferral of taxes on corporate income earned abroad.Evercore's Raffat says Amgen (AMGN) would benefit the most among drugmakers under this provision. Amgen has $34.4 billion in cash stashed overseas. That's money Amgen could use to help boost its war chest amid generic rivalries and a battle with Regeneron/Sanofi (SNY) on the cholesterol front.The same could be said for Gilead — $27.4 billion in overseas cash — which is facing dwindling sales in its hepatitis C drug franchise. Gilead had been under pressure for months amid analyst chatter that it should buy something to bolster sales. Incyte (INCY) is a likely candidate, analysts say.According to Raffat, Merck and Pfizer have a respective $21.9 billion and $15 billion in cash outside the U.S. Lilly, Bristol, Celgene (CELG), Biogen and AbbVie (ABBV) each have under $10 billion parked overseas. That cash could be repatriated for research and development, or used to fuel M&A.Pfizer Chief Executive Ian Read offered a similar view as Gilead's Milligan on the company's May 2 first-quarter earnings conference call. Though he expects industry consolidation to continue over time, the political atmosphere remains a major deterrent.""I believe there is simply too much redundancy and fragmentation, both globally and in the U.S., for the sector to continually efficiently deliver medicines to society,"" he said. ""However, there is a lack of clarity on potential tax reform, health care policies of the U.S. and uncertainties in the European markets.""Canaccord's Steadman doesn't expect a wave of M&A even if Trump's tax reform passes muster with Congress. There's no need to attempt Pfizer-Allergan-like mergers for inversion purposes, he said. Though the appetite for U.S. biotechs looks healthy.""We'd see a decline in those big inversion-type mergers that were not necessarily strategic, but you could see an appetite for U.S. biotech assets just because the tax picture looks better,"" he said. ""The net result is actually a decrease in large mergers but maybe an increase in valuations for biotech, but I don't think it drives much more M&A.""There's much that's still murky in Trump's tax proposal, analysts say.""The general theme is tax reform would be a good thing for biotech,"" Mizuho's Syed told IBD. ""But we don't exactly know what tax reform is going to be. There are still a lot of pieces moving around. Repatriation? A border tax? We don't have all the components of it.""A border tax, though, could be an extreme drawback for U.S. companies with manufacturing in less expensive countries. Such an adjustment could exempt exports from taxation, while taxing imports, PwC analysts Doug Strang and Kathy Michael wrote in a Feb. 6 report.In a January speech at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady said a tax would eliminate the tax incentives for U.S. companies to move their manufacturing overseas.""Coupled with the new lower GOP tax rates on local businesses and ending double-taxation of U.S. earnings overseas, this establishes America as a 21st century magnet for new jobs, technology breakthroughs and headquarters,"" he said. ""The GOP tax plan is already driving companies to ask themselves, 'How soon can we bring our suppliers back to the U.S.?'""For most companies, relocating their operations back to the U.S. would be a ""paperwork nightmare,"" Canaccord's Steadman said. In the current plan — which doesn't include a border tax provision — there's nothing to incentivize companies to bring operations back to the U.S.But it could be enough to keep newer and smaller companies from re-domiciling overseas, he said.""It's probably enticing future companies to not leave the U.S., I think that's the core goal of what they're trying to do,"" he said. ""If they were U.S.-domiciled at a lower rate, they wouldn't have to leave cash in a foreign subsidiary and that cash would be based in the U.S. which would encourage investment in the U.S.""RELATED:Did Gilead Just Provide Some 'Incyte' Into A Potential Deal?Dow's Pfizer Tops Earnings Views But Sales Come Up ShortHow Lilly's New Drug Could Spark A Deeper Rivalry With Pfizer, Novartis

97,LLY,"Drug stocks popped a collective 1.4% midday Thursday after the GOP health care bill to repeal and replace major portions of ObamaCare narrowly passed in the House.Following the vote, IBD's 43-company Medical-Ethical Drugs industry group rose to a one-month high. Generic drug and biotech stocks, on the other hand, advanced just 0.5% apiece.Zoetis (ZTS) stock lifted 6.3%, but that followed a consensus-crushing first quarter earlier in the day. Also up, Endo International (ENDP) stock rose 3.5%, Mallinckrodt (MNK) stock popped 2.3% and Eli Lilly (LLY) stock was up 2.1%.Analysts had said uncertainty regarding President Trump's health care ambitions would weigh on the biotech and pharma market this year. In April, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges told Investor's Business Daily it doesn't seem as if ""the accumulated worries are going to go away in a hurry.""""We're worried about Donald Trump and health care reform ... we're worried about FDA reform and now we're worried about drug-pricing regulations,"" he said.IBD'S TAKE: Biotech stocks are now rated No. 19 out of 197 groups tracked. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a list of the top-rated biotech stocks.The House vote landed largely along partisan lines, 217-213, on President Trump's 105th day in office. Republicans lauded the bill as a major win. In its current form, it eliminates the individual coverage mandate and protection for patients with pre-existing conditions.Under TrumpCare, states would be allowed to apply for waivers to exempt themselves from 10 ""essential health benefits"" outlined under ObamaCare, including coverage for maternity and newborn care, prescription drugs and mental health.According to the Congressional Budget Office, the bill is expected to reduce the federal deficit by $337 billion over 2017-26. In 2018-19, average premiums for single policyholders are expected to rise 15%-20% as the number of uninsured grows by 24 million in 2026.RELATED:Biotech Surge: How To Survive In A Volatile Market

98,LLY,"Dow component Pfizer (PFE) on Tuesday reported mixed first-quarter results as what it calls its Essential Health unit tugged down overall sales, though revenue from a Novartis (NVS)-rivaling cancer drug bounded 58% vs. the year-earlier quarter.Pfizer said it earned adjusted income of 69 cents a share on revenue of $12.78 billion for the first quarter, up 3% and down 2%, respectively. Analysts had expected the No. 2 drugmaker to report earnings of 67 cents a share on sales of $13.09 billion.During the quarter, Pfizer's Innovative Health unit, which includes its newer products, grew 6%. But its Essential Health business, which includes legacy products, offset that, falling 9%. In September, Pfizer scrapped the idea of a corporate breakup that would have split the two businesses.Wall Street has pinned some hopes on Pfizer's Ibrance, which is approved to treat some forms of advanced breast cancer. Ibrance sales grew 58% to $679 million in the period. But it has some competition from Novartis' Kisqali. Further, Eli Lilly's (LLY) abemaciclib has shown promise in clinical trials.Sales of pneumonia vaccine Prevnar 13 toppled 8% vs. the year-earlier quarter. In the U.S., the dip was ""primarily due to the continued decline in revenues from the adult indication due to smaller remaining 'catch-up opportunity,'"" Pfizer said. Globally, sales fell on the timing of government purchases.Enbrel, an immunosuppressant, also saw sales dip. Outside the U.S. and Canada, Enbrel sales came in at $588 million, down 20%. In developed Europe, Enbrel sales fell 28% to $348 million. Revenue also toppled 6% and 3% in emerging markets and other developed parts of the globe, respectively.IBD'S TAKE: Having trouble keeping up with the slew of pharma and biotech earnings this quarter? Catch up on IBD's Biotech And Pharma Industry And Stock News page.Pfizer also reiterated its 2017 guidance for $52 billion to $54 billion in revenue and adjusted earnings of $2.50-$2.60 a share, flat and up 6.3%, respectively. Analysts are calling for $53.15 billion in revenue and adjusted income of $2.55 per share.On the stock market today, shares for the member of the Dow Jones industrial average dipped 0.5% to 33.61 after earlier falling as much as 2.7%, touching their lowest point in three months. The stock has a potential buy point at 34.75 out of a cup-with-handle that began forming in August.Meanwhile, fellow Dow drug giant Merck (MRK) also issues its first-quarter earnings report.

99,LLY,"Biotechs cruised to a sixth day of gains Monday despite price target cuts for the likes of Alkermes (ALKS) and Alder Biopharmaceuticals (ALDR) following their recent first-quarter earnings.Alkermes, Alder and Aimmune Therapeutics (AIMT) stocks remain ""top picks in small- and midsize-cap,"" Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan said Monday. Though he slashed his price target on shares of Alkermes to 70 from 78, and on Alder stock to 30 from 33, he has outperform ratings on both.Midmorning on the stock market today, Investor's Business Daily's 425-company Biomed/Biotech industry group added 0.7%, continuing its streak past a week. Alder stock complied with that, and popped 7.7% to close at 21.60. Alkermes stock lifted 1.9% to 59.34. That followed first-quarter performances in which Alkermes was light on its top and bottom lines, and Alder's losses were worse than expected.Still, Divan remained bullish on Alder stock. He noted Alder's adjusted loss of $1.99 a share — vs. consensus views for a 95-cent loss — was the result of a ramp-up in research and development spending for a migraine drug.Alder competes against the likes of Amgen (AMGN), Eli Lilly (LLY) and Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA) in a class of migraine drugs called anti-calcitonin gene-related peptide, or anti-CGRP. CGRPs are peptides thought to be related to migraines. These drugs work to block those peptides.""While expenses were higher than expected this quarter and will be going forward, we believe the key to the Alder story remains the upcoming Phase 3 data,"" he said. Alder expects to have data in frequent episodic migraines by midyear and in chronic migraines by the first half of 2018.IBD'S TAKE: Investing in biotech doesn't have to be a pain. Head to IBD's Technology page for quick tips on how to survive in this volatile market.""Questions around the ability of Alder to differentiate eptinezumab from competitors in the CGRP space and the intellectual property situation are likely to remain, potentially limiting the upside that we could see with positive Phase 3 data,"" he said. ""But we continue to see significant longer-term upside.""In Alkermes' case, Divan is betting on opioid dependence pill Vivitrol becoming a blockbuster to help offset challenges like the loss of four of five patents protecting Acorda Therapeutics' (ACOR) Ampyra. Alkermes manufacturers the multiple sclerosis drug for Acorda.Divan also lowered his views for 2017 sales of schizophrenia drug Aristada to $96 million from $101 million. He also cut his 2026 estimate for the product to $570 million from $610 million.""Our enthusiasm on Alkermes remains driven by the upside we expect from Vivitrol in the near to midterm and then the pipeline over time,"" he wrote in a note to clients.Aimmune is expected to have top-line results from a Phase 3 study of a drug for peanut allergies by the end of the year, Divan said. Based on efficacy in Phase 2 testing and a seemingly better understanding of the safety and tolerability profile, he is optimistic on the outcome.Divan has an outperform rating and 36 price target on Aimmune stock. He is also bullish on Myokardia, Foamix Pharmaceuticals and Edge Therapeutics stocks where he has price targets of 25, 9 and 19, respectively. He is outperform-rated on all of them.RELATED:Acorda, Forward, Biogen Fall On Multiple Sclerosis Drug FightLilly Regains Key Migraine Drug With $960 Million CoLucid AcquisitionLilly, Merck, Allergan Top Analyst's View For 2017 Pharma

But, on Monday, Lilly said its breast cancer drug abemaciclib, rivaling that of Pfizer (PFE) and Novartis (NVS), met its goals at an interim analysis.The breast cancer win gave Lilly stock some confidence heading into its early Tuesday first-quarter earnings report. On the call, investors will likely look for commentary regarding plans for baricitinib, but also strong numbers for its diabetes and chemotherapy units.Among new drugs, Lilly's biggest are Trulicity, a diabetes drug, and Cyramza, a tumor drug. Trulicity sales launched 160% in the first quarter to $372.9 million with Cyramza up 31% to $171.2 million. Lilly saw major outperformance from Basaglar, a diabetes drug, which saw sales grow 321%.IBD'S TAKE: Lilly stock has a middling IBD Composite Rating of 43, meaning it underperforms more than half of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. A better stock bet is Jazz Pharmaceuticals with a CR of 83 out of a best-possible 99. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a list of the top five-rated drugmakers.Consensus: The consensus expected Lilly to report 96 cents adjusted profits on $5.22 billion in sales. On a year-over-year basis, adjusted earnings per share would be up 15.7%. Sales would grow 7.2%.Results: Lilly reported $5.228 billion in sales and 98 cents adjusted EPS, up 7% and 18%, respectively.Guidance: The company reaffirmed its 2017 adjusted EPS guidance for $4.05-$4.15.Stock Action: Lilly stock fell 2.7 to close at 81.20 on the stock market today after announcing its first-quarter results.

101,LLY,"Eli Lilly (LLY) stock popped Monday after the drugmaker said its breast cancer drug ""has the potential to be best in class,"" potentially sparking a deeper rivalry with Pfizer (PFE) and Novartis (NVS).Lilly stock finished 1.9% higher at 83.42 on the stock market today. The stock touched its 50-day moving average for the first time in five trading days. IBD's 43-company Medical-Ethical Drugs industry group jumped nearly 1%.The drug, abemaciclib, improved progression-free survival and overall survival when combined with an aromatase inhibitor — another type of breast cancer treatment — by its interim analysis. The Street expected the trial to run to completion with a final analysis at the end of the year.Specific results are expected in June during the annual American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting. The most common side effects, Lilly said, were diarrhea, fatigue, nausea and neutropenia or lack of some types of white blood cells.Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez called the trial results as ""unexpected win"" for Lilly. Abemaciclib belongs to a class of drugs that work to inhibit CDK4/6 enzymes in an effort to treat breast cancer.""Lilly is gearing up to compete with Pfizer and Novartis in the CDK4/6 breast cancer market with Pfizer's Ibrance leading the market since its launch in 2015 and Novartis' Kisqali recently receiving FDA approval,"" he wrote in a note to clients.IBD'S TAKE: Eli Lilly stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 43, meaning it underperforms the majority of stocks in terms of key growth metrics. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a list of better stock bets.Though Pfizer's Ibrance is leading the market — Kisqali was approved in March — abemaciclib ""now has two major wins under its belt that could put it on equal footing with Pfizer's Ibrance,"" Fernandez said.Abemaciclib also had strong top-line results in a Phase 2 study announced in March, Fernandez noted. He has an outperform rating on Lilly stock.RELATED:Could Lilly Outperform These Bigger Rivals On Strong Diabetes Meds?Eli Lilly, Incyte Stocks Break Key Levels After FDA Drug SetbackCan Lilly Survive Rheumatoid Arthritis Flop With Breast Cancer Drug?

103,LLY,"The stock market held its gains in afternoon trading Monday, as the Nasdaq made a favorable move on its chart.The Nasdaq rose 0.6% and was inching back above its 50-day moving average. The Nasdaq 100 looked better as it jumped 0.6% and separated itself a bit above its own 50-day line. The index of the 100 largest nonfinancial Nasdaq listings never went below the 50-day average last week.Netflix (NFLX), one of the largest Nasdaq components, was up 3% in the highest volume on Stocks On The Move. The video streaming company announces results after the close today.The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average were also up 0.6% each, although both remained below their 50-day averages, meaning there's still reason to be suspicious about a rebound in the market.Volume was tracking lower, which was a surprise given that the prior session's trading slowed ahead of the three-day weekend. Also curious was the fact that only a few stocks were up in heavy volume.Homebuilders continued to provide some interesting charts. D.R. Horton (DHI) was trying to break out past the 34.15 buy point of a cup-with-handle base. But both the price and volume activity was insufficient to view today's move as a rush of institutional buying. The relative strength line is not near a new high, which is another damper on the potential entry.Homebuilders have shot up to the top 10 of IBD's 197 industry rankings from below 50 six weeks ago. William Lyon Homes (WLH) and CalAtlantic Group (CAA) also are forming cup-with-handle bases and could be researched further.Health care stocks were mixed as pharmaceuticals and hospitals tumbled for a variety of reasons.HCA Holdings (HCA) slid 3% in about double its usual volume, breaking below the 50-day moving average. The hospital operator gave preliminary first-quarter results today, reporting sales of $10.623 billion, up 4% from a year ago. Earnings per share rose 2% to $1.74. The numbers were below expectations.IBD's hospital industry group was the worst performing in today's market. HCA is 6% below its 52-week high, but others are more than 20% below it.Baxter International (BAX) fell 1% in active trading but remained in a price advance that has taken the stock to record highs. Reports said the U.S. Justice Department is investigating sales practices of intravenous saline, including those sold by Baxter.Abiomed (ABMD), which makes the Impella heart pump, gapped down to a loss of 3.5% in big volume. The stock, which has been forming a base, fell to its 50-day line. There was no news on the wires.Among pharmaceuticals, Eli Lilly (LLY) and Incyte (INCY) plunged below their 50-day lines in heavy volume after the FDA declined to approve their rheumatoid arthritis drug, saying more clinical trials are necessary.RELATED:Eli Lilly, Incyte Stocks Break Key Levels After FDA Drug SetbackNetflix Earnings After The Close: What To Expect
"
104,LLY,"AbbVie (ABBV) will get some breathing room in rheumatoid arthritis after Eli Lilly (LLY) and Incyte's (INCY) drug was hit with delays by the Food and Drug Administration over the weekend, leaving Lilly to instead focus on a Pfizer (PFE)-rivaling breast cancer med.On Friday, the FDA asked for more dosing information for Lilly and Incyte's rheumatoid arthritis drug, baricitinib, causing what could be a lengthy delay in its release. So Lilly's breast cancer drug known as abemaciclib is now especially important for Lilly, Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez said.Abemaciclib could compete against Pfizer's Ibrance and Novartis' (NVS) Kisqali in the CDK4/6 inhibitor market. These drugs aim to inhibit a specific set of enzymes thought to be tied to breast cancer.""In our Lilly model, we are currently forecasting $1.5 billion global sales of abemaciclib by 2026 with the overall CDK4/6 market reaching more than $10 billion,"" Fernandez wrote in a note to clients.Fernandez said abemaciclib could be the next major catalyst for Lilly's stock. Phase 3 data on abemaciclib is expected in June.""We believe abemaciclib's ability to dose continuously together with a safe and manageable tolerability profile likely will make abemaciclib highly competitive with Novartis' Kisqali — and provide opportunities to differentiate from Pfizer's Ibrance on secondary efficacy measures like response rate,"" Fernandez said.The analyst kept his outperform rating and 91 price target on Lilly stock.Lilly shares toppled as much as 5.6% on the stock market today, closing down 4.1% to 82.38, below its 50-day ling and a 83.34 buy point. Incyte stock tumbled 10.5% to 126.07. The delay on baricitinib means it likely won't get FDA approval until 2018 and launch until 2019. That removes a near-term rival for AbbVie's Humira. It also puts Lilly/Incyte seven to eight years behind Pfizer's Xeljanz, and more in line with generic-like competition.Analysts expect the drug to be delayed at least a year, and shares of Lilly and Incyte toppled early Monday. Baricitinib already has been approved for use in Europe.While baricitinib is likely delayed, Fernandez expects $1.7 billion in peak U.S. sales when it is approved. And Lilly still benefits from sales in Europe where the drug has attained approval.IBD'S TAKE: IBD's 43-company Ethical-Drugmakers industry group has risen to No. 150 out of 197 groups tracked from No. 184 just four weeks ago. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a list of the top-rated drugmakers.Other analysts agreed on the one-year delay for baricitinib, but were more cautious on Lilly's breast cancer drug. BMO analyst Alex Arfaei called abemaciclib ""the biggest remaining uncertainty for Lilly in 2017."" He sees the data as likely to disappoint.""We still have not seen much data that would indicate CDK4/6 inhibitors are meaningfully differentiated,"" he wrote in a report. ""Data from (the American Association for Cancer Research) 2017 suggests abemaciclib is not as selective as ribociclib (Kisqali) and Ibrance.""Arfaei cut his price target on Lilly stock to 71 from 73, though he maintained his forecast for 5% sales growth for Lilly in 2017 on its diabetes drugs Trulicity, Jardiance and Basaglar, and psoriasis drug Talz.These drugs ""should offset the decline of mature franchises,"" he wrote. ""However, from 2015-20, we forecast revenue compound annual growth rate of 4%, below Lilly's guidance of 5% partly because more conservative assumptions for the mature franchises.""RELATED:Eli Lilly, Incyte Stocks Break Key Levels After FDA Drug SetbackHow Biogen's Takeover Prospects Soured In Mere MonthsBiotechs Split: Axovant Rides CEO Swap, But Celgene Partner Dives
"
105,LLY,"Eli Lilly (LLY) is set to outperform bigger drugmakers Novartis (NVS) and Sanofi (SNY) in terms of first-quarter diabetes sales, helping tug Lilly up after its rheumatoid arthritis drug was delayed at the FDA, one analyst said Tuesday.Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez kept his outperform ratings on Lilly and Sanofi stocks and market perform rating on Novartis ahead of their first-quarter earnings in a note to clients. Lilly and Novartis are set to report earnings April 25, with Sanofi coming on April 28.""We believe Lilly is poised to deliver a strong top-line and bottom-line performance,"" Fernandez said. ""The pullback of the stock following the FDA's complete response letter for baricitinib creates an attractive trading opportunity, in our view.""On Monday, Lilly stock lost 4.1% after the FDA said the application for Lilly's rheumatoid arthritis drug, baricitinib, is incomplete without further clinical dosing information. The request likely hampers baricitinib, produced in partnership with Incyte (INCY), by at least a year.Though other analysts have said baricitinib is likely delayed by a year, Fernandez sees the Lilly/Incyte drug delayed by 18 to 24 months to late 2018 or 2019. He cut his annual global sales forecast for the drug by $200 million.But sales of diabetes drug Trulicity and psoriasis drug Talz will more than offset the delay for baricitinib, Fernandez said. He raised his peak sales for Trulicity and Talz to $4.5 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively.Overall, the consensus of analysts polled by Yahoo (YHOO) expects Lilly to report $5.2 billion in sales, up 7.1% vs. the year-earlier period, and adjusted earnings of 96 cents a share, up 15.7%. Fernandez is more bullish, at $5.3 billion and 98 cents. He boosted his price target on Lilly shares to 93 from 91.Fernandez expects Sanofi and Novartis to deliver in-line revenue as each firm's basal insulin diabetes franchise faces pricing pressure. These drugs include Lantus and Toujeo for Sanofi and Levemir and Tresiba for Novartis.IBD'S TAKE: Eli Lilly has a middling IBD Composite Rating of 53 based on key growth metrics like earnings and sales performance. Better stock bets include the likes of Jazz Pharmaceuticals (JAZZ), which has a CR of 86 out of a best-possible 99. Head to the Stock Checkup to see how your picks stack up.Lantus and Toujeo prescriptions are performing better than expected in the face of the launch of Basaglar from Lilly, Fernandez said in a note to clients. Still, he sees a 15% year-over-year pricing decline for Lantus.The silver lining for Sanofi is Dupixent, an eczema-treating injection in conjunction with partner Regeneron (REGN). The drug was approved in March so it won't have sales in the first quarter. The consensus sees Sanofi's sales dipping 5.5% in the first quarter to $8.88 billion.For Novartis, Fernandez notes Victoza is still growing and Tresiba ""uptake is on track,"" but pricing pressure is likely to weigh on both diabetes drugs through at least the end of the third quarter.Broadly, analysts expect Novartis to report 0.7% sales growth to $11.68 billion and adjusted earnings of $1.13 a share, down 3 cents vs. the year-earlier period.Sanofi fell 2.4% to close at 44.45 on the stock market today. Lilly dropped 1.4% to 81.20. Novartis dipped 0.5% to 72.93. That followed Johnson & Johnson's lackluster first-quarter results, which saw drug sales eke out a 0.8% gain.RELATED:Can Lilly Survive Rheumatoid Arthritis Flop With Breast Cancer Drug?Dow's Johnson & Johnson Sets Up Lackluster Results For Sector

If Lilly and Incyte have to conduct more clinical trials to satisfy the FDA, the delay could set their drug behind several rivals.Lilly reaffirmed its earnings and sales guidance for the year, while Incyte will discuss the matter in its Q1 conference call.Eli Lilly fell 4.1% to close at 82.38 on the stock market today. Eli Lilly has fallen below an 83.34 buy point cleared in early March.Incyte tumbled 10.5% to 126.07, plunging through its 50-day moving average.The setback for Lilly and Incyte is good news for Dow Jones industrial average component Pfizer (PFE), which has the only oral JAK inhibitor for rheumatoid arthritis on the market, Xeljanz. Gilead Sciences (GILD), has a similar oral drug to baricitinib in Phase Three trials.

113,LLY,"Regeneron (REGN) and Sanofi's (SNY) eczema drug Dupixent outstripped psoriasis drugs from rival companies in fourth-week prescriptions, an analyst wrote Monday, suggesting that 2017 consensus views for the drug are ""beatable.""On Friday, Sanofi said on its earnings call that 2,500 prescriptions had been written by 1,200 physicians in Dupixent's first month on the market. Health care tracker IMS suggests 200 prescriptions were filled in the fourth week after Dupixent's launch.By comparison, 52-60 prescriptions of psoriasis drugs Novartis's (NVS) Cosentyx and Taltz from Eli Lilly (LLY) had been written at this point following their launches. Celgene's (CELG) Otezla had 101 scripts.""The most successful of those drugs has been Otezla, and the fourth week of the Dupixent launch is double the prescription volume for Otezla,"" Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges wrote in a note to clients. He also noted two recent successful launches of cholesterol-lowering drugs Amgen's (AMGN) Repatha and Regeneron/Sanofi's Praluent saw 72-80 prescriptions.Otezla's estimated monthly net price over that period was $1,600 which is 40% below the likely net price of Dupixent, Porges wrote. Adjusting for only the higher price, Dupixent's 2017 sales would be $115 million based on Otezla's sales record.""However, if Dupixent indeed continues to see double the prescription volume of Otezla, the 2017 revenue could be closer to $230 million, or a 68% beat compared to consensus,"" he said. Though it's early post-launch, ""the information thus far is very encouraging.""IBD'S TAKE: How do you survive investing in a market where a relatively unheard of company like Esperion Therapeutics (ESPR) can launch nearly 200% in mere months? It's all a matter of identifying the right catalysts, analysts say. Head to IBD's Technology page for more.Based on Sanofi's disclosure of 2,500 written Dupixent prescriptions in the first month, Porges models a 25% fill rate in April growing to a 45% fill rate by December as more payers open up access. That leads to potentially 300 prescriptions filled in the fifth week.This is ""not unreasonable given the prior week-over-week growth of 93 prescriptions,"" Porges said.Analysts broadly model $20 million in Dupixent sales for the second quarter, $48 million in the third, $70 million in the fourth and $137 million for 2017. Porges sees $206 million in Dupixent sales for 2017 growing to $1.13 billion and $3 billion in 2018 and 2019.Comparatively, Otezla and Cosentyx brought in $103 million and $210 million in this first four quarters on the market.""By comparison, Dupixent is more expensive than Otezla, but significantly cheaper than Cosentyx, and is entering a much less competitive category with more untreated patients and what appears to be faster access to major (pharmacy benefit manager) formularies,"" he wrote.Porges reiterated his outperform rating and 448 price target on Regeneron stock. On the stock market today, Regeneron stock was up 2% to 396.17. Sanofi stock fell 0.1% to 47.26.RELATED:Amgen Trumps Regeneron, Sanofi In Post-Trial Cholesterol Drug ScriptsAmgen Payer Pushback Likely To Sting Amid Battle With Regeneron, SanofiRegeneron, Sanofi Get Approval For Eczema Drug Priced At $37,000

114,LLY,"It was just a year ago that the formula seemed right for Biogen (BIIB), the fourth-largest company in its industry, to mix up a biotechnology megamerger.Biogen's multiple sclerosis franchise — a lineup of six drugs that includes Tecfidera and Tysabri — was growing. Tecfidera, Biogen's most important drug, brought in $3.97 billion in 2016, up 9%.Further, hemophilia sales, though small, grew 53% in 2016 to $847 million between just two brand-name drugs, Eloctate and Alprolix. And Spinraza, a spinal muscular atrophy drug, grabbed FDA approval just days before Christmas.The plot thickened when Biogen's chief executive, George Scangos, resigned in July, leaving the company susceptible to takeout by the likes of Merck (MRK), Allergan (AGN), Eli Lilly (LLY) and Pfizer (PFE). Takeout rumors abounded, and Biogen stock ended 2016 down 6.2%, making it a cheaper asset to buy.""I thought last year was really the time for it to happen,"" Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said. ""What Biogen offered last year was a relatively stable MS business that was still growing, a robust cash flow scheme, the opportunity for Spinraza and the hemophilia franchise. So an acquirer could say, 'I get all of that.' ""Fast-forward to today, and the picture is entirely different. Biogen is seeing increasing competition in the MS market, payers are balking at Spinraza prices, and the company has already taken its hemophilia drugs out of the equation.Now, only 24% of Wall Street sees Biogen as a potential takeout candidate in 2017, according to a Mizuho survey. And Porges says Biogen will probably have to wait until 2020 to see the deals roll in, if ever.""I think it has become significantly less likely,"" Porges said.So, what happened?After an incredibly successful 2016 in multiple sclerosis — including the launch of Zinbryta with AbbVie (ABBV) — Biogen's MS unit is facing looming competition from the likes of Roche (RHHBY) and Celgene (CELG), Porges told Investor's Business Daily.In a note to clients on April 7, Porges called Roche's Ocrevus a ""game-changer."" Ocrevus was approved in late March to treat both relapsing-remitting and primary progressive forms of MS, separating itself from the pack that is only approved for the relapsing-remitting form.""Both the MS physician and patient communities have been eagerly awaiting the Ocrevus launch,"" Porges said. ""The drug's high efficacy, reasonable safety profile and convenient six-month dosing schedule are all major factors in the drug's positive reception.""That spells trouble for Biogen, as Tecfidera had comprised 40% of total product sales as well as 76% of the MS unit. Biogen is actually partnered with Roche on Ocrevus, but the royalty won't be enough to offset erosion to its own MS franchise, analysts say.Porges expects Ocrevus to get 60% of the primary progressive MS market within three to four years. In the relapsing-remitting MS market, Porges sees 40%-50% erosion of Tysabri, and 30%-40% erosion of Tecfidera and Novartis' (NVS) Gilenya sales.Meanwhile, Celgene is working on an MS drug called ozanimod in Phase 3 testing. In function, ozanimod is closest to Novartis' Gilenya, though it could also rival Tecfidera or Sanofi's (SNY) Aubagio. Tecfidera, Gilenya and Aubagio, respectively, lead the MS market in terms of sales.""If Celgene wanted to buy a sales force and have something overnight to help sell ozanimod, Biogen could be that company,"" Porges told IBD. But with Biogen likely to suffer erosion from Roche competition in MS, that's looking less probable.The silver lining? Biogen won a patent and an interference case against Forward Pharma (FWP) over Tecfidera, though it was out a $1.25 billion settlement fee. Forward stock toppled 22.5% on the decision as it now loses out on a major royalty.Biogen's Spinraza has a different set of troubles. Developed with Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS), Spinraza is the first and only drug approved for the rare neurological disorder that causes muscle weakness and wasting in infants and children.Wall Street largely thought of Spinraza as a slam dunk. It had ""profound efficacy"" in two August 2016 studies in infants and children. The drug was so effective that Biogen and Ionis ended the studies early, Ionis Chief Executive Stanley Crooke told IBD in December.Spinraza was approved Dec. 23 with a fairly broad label. It's approved for use in children and adults with spinal muscular atrophy and remains the only drug approved for the disease that Crooke called ""catastrophic.""""This drug, of all things, should be rapidly adopted and widely reimbursed,"" Porges said. ""And what may have happened was what appeared to be good fortune with the label may have turned into a liability because payers became concerned too many patients would start on the drug so they restricted access.""Mizuho analyst Salim Syed calls 2017 ""largely a Spinraza story."" Biogen is set to report its first-quarter earnings on April 25. That will be particularly telling following the launch of Spinraza earlier this year. Analysts say, though, that payers are pushing back hard on reimbursements of the drug.Insurers Anthem (ANTM) and Humana (HUM) are only reimbursing patients on Spinraza with the most severe form of the disease, Type 1. UnitedHealth Group (UNH) has a broader policy, covering Type 1, 2 and 3 patients. That could be because Spinraza costs $125,000 per treatment, or $750,000 in the first year, and $375,000 in subsequent years, making it a pricey drug.The consensus is projecting $15 million in first-quarter Spinraza sales, Syed said.Porges lowered his expectations for Spinraza for 2017 to $266 million from $400 million. Sales results for the first quarter will be especially telling, he told IBD. North of 100 patients on the drug would be ""pretty good — as long as they're seeing continued starts.""Then there's Biogen's hemophilia drug lineup.In February, Biogen spun off its hemophilia franchise into Bioverativ (BIVV). Since then, Bioverativ shares are up 27%, which is great — for Bioverativ. But any company considering a Biogen takeover might think again without that unit, Porges said.IBD'S TAKE: Bioverativ isn't your standard biotech startup. Head to The New America to find out why.Bioverativ has yet to announce any quarterly results, having only been public since early February. The company is set to release its first-quarter earnings results on May 3. In its last full quarter with Biogen, that hemophilia unit brought in $242 million, up 11.5% year over year.Now, Porges says it would be smart for Biogen to also spin off its multiple sclerosis unit and turn its focus toward Alzheimer's. In Alzheimer's Biogen is following Eli Lilly and Merck, both of which had notable failures in December and February.Biogen's Alzheimer's play is the strongest in the sector, analysts say.In March, RBC analyst Michael Yee told IBD that Pfizer and Merck are the likeliest players to make a bid on Biogen. They would be ""interested in more branded drugs and particularly the Alzheimer's pipeline.""Biogen is working on two classes of Alzheimer's drugs — one that works to remove plaque buildups in the brain associated with Alzheimer's and another called a BACE inhibitor with Eisai. BACE inhibitors aim to prevent the plaque buildup.Porges says Biogen will likely have to wait until 2020 to see renewed takeover interest. In 2020, Biogen is expected to release the results of two Phase 3 trials of aducanumab. Its BACE inhibitor, elenbecestat, is also in a Phase 3 trial with results expected after September 2020.Eli Lilly's solanezumab worked on the theory that it would remove plaque buildup — called beta amyloid — in the brain. Merck's verubecestat was a BACE inhibitor. But both failed, and there are only a handful of potential Alzheimer's drugs in development now.Meanwhile, Axovant Sciences (AXON) is working on a different theory of treatment that doesn't involve beta amyloid. It expects to have Phase 3 data of its drug, intepirdine, later this year. That, too, could change the Alzheimer's landscape and potentially further dent Biogen's chances of a merger.Still, Biogen's board will place a high premium on its Alzheimer's pipeline if it ever comes to the acquisition table, Porges said. That's because everything else has failed and development costs for aducanumab and elenbecestat have headed toward the billions of dollars, Porges said.""If you're willing to take the risk on Alzheimer's, it still makes some sense as an acquisition, but what I've heard from people in and around the industry is they're struggling to bridge the gap,"" he said. ""The board wants to be paid for Alzheimer's as if it's going to work.""RELATED:How Roche's 'Game Changer' Drug Will Chip Away At Biogen, NovartisBiogen Dives As Takeover Buzz Fades, Drugs Hit SnagsCan This Small-Cap Biotech Take On Gilead, Celgene, Biogen In Alzheimer's?

115,LLY,"Axovant Sciences (AXON) and OncoMed Pharmaceuticals (OMED) diverged in IBD's 424-company biotech industry group Monday as Axovant stock rode its chief executive swap to a 16-month high and OncoMed stock toppled on a failed drug trial.By the closing bell, on the stock market today, Axovant stock popped 22.5%, to 18.54, after announcing that former Medivation CEO David Hung would succeed Vivek Ramaswamy at the top job at Axovant. Ramaswamy will move up to lead Axovant parent Roivant Sciences.Hung's appointment was effective Friday. He headed up Medivation until its $14 billion acquisition by Pfizer (PFE) in September 2016. Ramaswamy said in a news release that Axovant hadn't initially been looking for a new CEO.""I approached David about taking a role with us after the Mindset study,"" he said, adding that ""David decided he wanted to join us now."" The Mindset study looks at Axovant's drug intepirdine in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's patents; results are expected in September.Axovant stock busted out of a cup-with-handle formation that began in August 2016, passing a 15.90 entry point. Shares are now 24.8% extended from that buy point, touching a high last achieved in December 2015.Meanwhile, shares of OncoMed plunged to an all-time low after its drug, demcizumab, failed to extend progression-free survival in late-stage pancreatic cancer patients.OncoMed stock hit a record low, falling below 5 at one point during the session, and was down 36.6%, to 5.60, at the close.OncoMed's trial looked at a combination of demcizumab, gemcitabine and Abraxane. OncoMed also missed its second goal of improving overall survival. The trial compared demcizumab, gemcitabine — a chemotherapy first developed by Eli Lilly (LLY) — and Celgene (CELG) chemo Abraxane with gemcitabine and Abraxane plus a placebo.IBD'S TAKE: IBD's biotech industry group is ranked No. 4 out of 197 groups tracked, up from No. 56 just 13 weeks ago. Among biotechs, Celgene stock is the clear leader with an IBD Composite Rating of 99, out of a best-possible 99. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a list of the top-five best-performing biotechs.Also Monday, Bayer Pharma (BAYRY) dropped out of a deal to license OncoMed's drugs vantictumab and ipafricept for strategic reasons, OncoMed said in a news release. Both drugs aim to treat solid tumors and proved safe and effective alone and in combination with chemo in early trials.""While we had looked forward to collaborating with the Bayer team on the late-stage development of these biotherapeutics, we are very pleased to have worldwide rights to two promising Phase 2-ready assets,"" CEO Paul Hastings said in a statement.RELATED:Axovant Confidence 'Not Swayed' After Rival Alzheimer's Drug Fails

116,LLY,"Eli Lilly (LLY) heisted some of Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) Type 2 diabetes share in Q4, Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez said Wednesday, a day after Lilly stock outplayed a mixed quarter on a President Trump-related boost.Lilly stock ramped up 3.1% on Tuesday and continued in the black on Wednesday. At the closing bell on the stock market today, shares ended the regular session up 0.7% to 77.60, earlier touching a nearly three-month high of 78.57. Lilly stock reacted to a softer tone from Trump on Tuesday, who pledged to deregulate the industry and cut taxes.But Trump also called for drugmakers to manufacture in the U.S. in a meeting with executives from Celgene (CELG), Merck (MRK), Lilly, Novartis (NVS) and J&J. There, Trump reportedly backed off calls to revisit allowing the federal government to negotiate on behalf of Medicare and Medicaid.Fernandez, in a research note, said he was ""reluctant to call this first event a victory, but it was not as bad as prior commentary."" He kept his outperform rating and 91 price target on Lilly stock, noting the drugmaker's sales of diabetes drugs improved in Q4.Lilly's Q4 and 2016 sales topped estimates Tuesday, though earnings missed. Fernandez credited growth in diabetes products for sales performance. Sales of diabetes drugs Trulicity and Jardiance grew 200% and 421%, respectively, in 2016.IBD'S TAKE: Trump's commentary may have sent drug stocks on a run Tuesday, but his immigration ban on Monday toppled airline stocks. Who's falling and who will survive? Read IBD's Industry Themes for a deeper look.Trulicity belongs to a class of drugs called GLP-1 receptor inhibitors where it has 32% of new-to-brand share, with 30% year-over-year growth in the space, Fernandez wrote. Jardiance has 35% new-to-therapy share with endocrinologists, exceeding J&J's Invokana.Barclays analyst Geoff Meacham is less bullish, though he boosted his price target on Lilly stock to 85 from 80 and kept his outperform rating. In the Trump-rattled drug industry, Meacham says investors will prefer product-driven companies like Lilly.""Given the difficulty in triangulating where the drug pricing debate will settle out, we continue to prefer product-driven stories like Lilly with relatively low reliance on price or revenue concentration risk,"" he wrote in a research report.Lilly, though, is likely to struggle in the emerging immuno-oncology market, he wrote. The company is partnering with Merck to combine I-O drug Keytruda and chemotherapy Alimta to treat non-small-cell lung cancer. The FDA looks likely to approve the combo, he wrote.""We anticipate that the approval of KN-021G (a Phase 3 study) for Keytruda along with the recent favorable patent ruling could drive a pickup in Alimta growth,"" Meacham said.Outside oncology, Meacham expects Lilly to add two drugs to its pipeline in 2018: baricitinib for rheumatoid arthritis and galcanezumab in the anti-CGRP migraine market. In the latter arena, Lilly competes with Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA), Alder Pharmaceuticals (ALDR) and Amgen (AMGN).RELATED:Eli Lilly, Novartis Challenge Pfizer's Potential $8 Billion Breast Cancer DrugPfizer Reports Lagging Q4 EPS; Rebounds On Trump CommentaryBiotechs 'Round-Trip' Trump-Inspired Rally; FDA Appointment Key

117,LLY,"President Trump called for drugmakers to manufacture in the U.S. in an effort to curb rising prices, during a meeting with Big Pharma executives at the White House mere weeks after he accused the industry of ""getting away with murder.""Trump also promised to cut regulations and appoint a ""fantastic person"" to lead the Food and Drug Administration. Tight regulations and a slow FDA often jam the approval process, drugmakers say. Last year, the FDA approved 19 new molecular entities, a nine-year low.His tenor was reportedly different from earlier calls to have the federal government negotiate prices on behalf of Medicare and Medicaid. The agencies cover millions of Americans and are among the biggest purchasers of health care products and services in the world.At the same meeting, Trump pledged to increase international competition, cut taxes on businesses and lure companies back to the U.S. Trump has pledged to put America first. In his inaugural speech, he said ""every decision ... will be made to benefit American workers and American families.""IBD'S TAKE: This isn't the first time Trump has pledged to bring down rising drug prices. But what will that actually mean for biotech and drug stocks. Take a look at IBD's Industry Themes for a deeper dive.Pharma bigwigs including the CEOs of Eli Lilly (LLY), Merck (MRK), Celgene (CELG) and Novartis (NVS) reportedly attended the meeting. A Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) exec and the CEO of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America also reportedly attended.""The pricing has been astronomical,"" Trump said, according to Bloomberg. ""You folks have done a very great job over the years but we have to get the prices down.""Drug and biotech stocks reversed earlier losses after news of Trump's meeting emerged. IBD's 425-company Biomed/Biotech industry group jumped more than 3% by the close on the stock market today, and IBD's 43-company Ethical-Drugs industry group gained 1.5%.Meanwhile, the SPDR S&P Biotech (XBI) exchange-traded fund was up more than 4%, near 65 and moving above its 50-day line.

118,LLY,"Acorda Therapeutics' (ACOR) inhaled migraine drug could generate $50 million to $200 million in long-term sales and potentially rival a more ""novel mechanism"" from Eli Lilly (LLY), Janney analyst Ken Trbovich predicted Monday.Though Acorda's CVT-427 lacks ""a novel molecule with a novel mechanism"" — such as CoLucid's lasmiditan — it ""offers the potential clinical benefit from a more rapid and consistent administration of an existing triptan uniquely delivered via the pulmonary route,"" he wrote. Lilly last week announced an agreement to acquire CoLucid Pharmaceuticals.In clinical trials, CVT-427 has proved to match or be faster than triptans, a family of medicine used to treat migraines and cluster headaches. MAP Pharmaceuticals, which Amgen (AMGN) acquired in 2013, found inhaled DHE (dihydroergotamine) to be 30 minutes faster than placebos. Acorda will likely shoot for a similar result in its phase 3 trial of CVT-427.Oral pills are by far the most common route of administering migraine drugs. But non-oral admissions account for 15% of the existing zolmitriptan units dosed in the U.S., Trbovich said. He says this means CVT-427 could swipe a meaningful share of the triptan market.IBD'S TAKE: Analysts are generally cautious on biotech and pharma stocks heading into Q4 earnings season, but Incyte is grabbing bullish views on its potential blockbuster drugs. Dive into The New America for more.Lilly is buying CoLucid for $960 million to get its hands on lasmiditan. Lilly discovered lasmiditan in-house but licensed the drug to CoLucid in 2005.Although inhaled DHE ""lacks the novelty offered by CoLucid's lasmiditan,"" the method of migraine treatment was enough to attract $130 million in development milestones for MAP Pharma before Amgen spent $958 million to acquire it, Trbovich noted.Trbovich sees a relatively clear path of CVT-427's approval following Phase 2b trials in 2018 and Phase 3 trials in 2019-2020. He sees the drug launching in 2021 with a device patent protecting it through 2031. A pending patent pertaining to CVT-427's formulation could protect it to 2036.He has a neutral rating on Acorda stock, which fell 1.4% to 20.70 on Monday but stayed above its 50-day line.RELATED:Lilly Regains Key Migraine Drug With $960 Million CoLucid AcquisitionAmgen Plans Robust 2017 In Alzheimer's, Migraines, Oncology: CEO ExclusiveDrug Stocks Tank As Trump Vows To Attack High Drug Prices

119,LLY,"Pfizer's (PFE) Ibrance could grow to $8 billion to $9 billion in sales beyond 2023, but Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez says the No. 2 drugmaker will first have to overcome competition from Eli Lilly (LLY) and Novartis (NVS).Ibrance belongs to a class of drugs called CDK4 and CDK6 selective inhibitors. The Food and Drug Administration approved a combination of Ibrance and Femara (an aromatase inhibitor) in February 2015 as a treatment for estrogen receptor (ER) positive advanced breast cancer.But now Eli Lilly and Novartis are creeping in with abemaciclib and ribociclib, respectively. Abemaciclib was approved for ""Breakthrough Designation"" in 2015 and is amid several Phase 3 tests. Last year, the FDA granted ribociclib priority review for first-line advanced breast cancer.Prescription trends show Ibrance is slowing after a rapid uptake in the U.S. Fernandez lowered his yearly sales expectations by $800 million, but still sees Ibrance running up to $8 million to $9 million in global annual revenue after 2023.IBD'S TAKE: Pfizer had seven drugs approved in 2012-16. Who else curried favor over that time period? Head to IBD's Industry Themes for more.Fernandez, in a research report, kept his market perform rating and 36 price target on Pfizer stock. In afternoon trading on the stock market today, Pfizer rose 14 cents to 21.29. The company is set to report its Q4 earnings before the open Tuesday.Fourth-quarter sales and earnings were likely in line for Pfizer, Fernandez said. The consensus of 23 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expects Pfizer to report $13.64 billion in sales and 50 cents in EPS ex items, down a respective 2.9% and 5.7% vs. the year-earlier quarter.The $14 billion acquisition of Medivation, completed in September will add sales of prostate cancer drug Xtandi to Pfizer's top line, but that will mostly be offset by generic erosion of Lipitor and Pristiq, Fernandez said. Enbrel, a TNF inhibitor marketed by Amgen (AMGN) and Pfizer, is facing biosimilar pressure.In 2017, Fernandez expects Pfizer's overall sales to grow 2% vs. 2016.RELATED:Lilly Nears FDA Nod On Arthritis Drug, But Chemo Med Stuck In CourtAmgen Could Gouge 'Top Pick' AbbVie With Humira Biosimilar: JefferiesTrump's 'Disastrous' Pharma View Doesn't Rattle JPMorgan Drug Conference

120,LLY,"Roche's (RHHBY) Tecentriq is modestly trailing Merck's (MRK) Keytruda and continues to chip away at Bristol-Myers Squibb's (BMY) share of the second-line lung cancer market, Barclays analyst Geoff Meacham said Tuesday.Overall, immuno-oncology drugs have swiped 30% of the total lung cancer market, up from the high 20% range seen in previous quarters, Meacham said in a research report. I-O drugs are most popular in second-line non-small cell lung cancer and melanoma, with 60% and 60%-70% shares, respectively.Bristol-Myers, though, is struggling in the second-line NSCLC setting, Meacham says. In Q4, Opdivo saw its high 40% share of the market fall as Tecentriq gained by mid-single digits sequentially. Tecentriq is now modestly trailing Keytruda, he says.Investors are seemingly disappointed that Bristol-Myers isn't seeking accelerated approval for its Opdivo plus Yervoy combination in first-line NSCLC. I-O combos are widely suspected to be more potent than combining I-O plus chemo. Merck is testing the latter with Keytruda plus Eli Lilly's (LLY) Alimta.Keytruda already is approved as a monotherapy in first-line NSCLS for patients with a high expression of the PD-L1 gene, metastatic melanoma, and head and neck squamous-cell carcinoma. The Food and Drug Administration recently granted priority review to its I-O/chemo combination.IBD'S TAKE: Merck, Biogen and Eli Lilly tied in 2016 for two drug approvals apiece, leading the broader biotech industry. Who trailed? Get more on IBD's Industry Themes.The combo could open Merck up to a broader patient population. Only 25%-30% of patients fall into the category of having a high expression of the PD-L1 gene. But half of patients are being tested, Meacham says. Four in 10 have the gene, regardless of expression.Chemotherapy is dominant in first-line NSCLC, where it has an 80% share to Keytruda's 11%. Still, momentum looks good in 2017 for Keytruda, Meacham said. But sentiment is more negative on Bristol-Myers following its decision against the accelerated regulatory route for Opdivo plus Yervoy.""For Bristol, the recent decision not to pursue an accelerated first-line pathway has little impact on our near-term estimates, but increasingly negative sentiment makes the premium to the group harder to sustain absent convincing pivotal data,"" he wrote in a research report.Meacham trimmed his price target on Bristol-Myers stock to 58 from 65. His rating on the overall biotech industry is positive.Bristol-Myers stock fell 2.1% to 48.96 on Tuesday, coming within a penny of a more than two-year low. Merck fell 1% to 61.21.RELATED:FDA Track Record Bodes Well For Merck Keytruda Plus Chemo: LeerinkCould Merck's 'Meaningful' Keytruda Royalty Give Bristol-Myers A Leg Up?Bristol-Myers Dives On Opdivo Setback, Will Get Keytruda Royalties

121,LLY,"When Peter Gassner launched Veeva Systems (VEEV) in 2007, he didn't expect to outstrip $500 million in revenue, watch its stock triple in a span of less than three years or expand its arsenal of products to 23 applications.Instead, Gassner was in ""survival mode.""""In the beginning you have nothing — you have no products, no customers, no people, nothing,"" said Gassner, a one-time alum of Salesforce.com (CRM). ""You have exactly zero. So, then you have to start hiring some people, you have to make a product and get your first customer.""He added: ""Grand plans are sort of interesting, but it doesn't mean anything until you can hire your first developer or get your first customer.""Today, Veeva provides the cloud backbone for the $1.7 trillion life sciences industry where it rivals the likes of Medidata Solutions (MDSO), and counts companies like Pfizer (PFE), Novartis (NVS), Amgen (AMGN) and Eli Lilly (LLY) among its customers.As drugmakers tackle the challenge of developing, testing and manufacturing lifesaving drugs, Veeva operates the cloud system in the background. Its dual roles include organizing doctor information for pharmaceutical reps and clinical trial data/graphs for companies.Gassner calls the latter point ""Veeva's second act."" In total, Veeva estimates its total addressable market at $7 billion, though Gassner expects its nascent third act could add another $1 billion onto that. After all, becoming bigger and better is exactly what companies like Alphabet (GOOGL), IBM (IBM) and Cisco Systems (CSCO) did, he said.""The important thing in a company is, if you want to keep it going, your second act should probably end up being as big or bigger than your first act,"" he told Investor's Business Daily. ""A company that can make its second act bigger than its first act has some long-term ability to reinvent itself.""Veeva launched 10 years ago with a single application to help pharmaceutical reps organize drug data to make stronger doctor pitches. Today, 60% of the globe's pharma sales reps use what's called Veeva CRM — customer relationship management — an iPad application.Getting drug company managers to buy in early on wasn't difficult, Gassner says.IBD'S TAKE: Veeva Systems stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 98 out of a best-possible 99, meaning it outperforms 97% of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a list of strong software leaders.""I think the life sciences industry is more business-outcome oriented,"" he said. ""There's important things the CEOs focus on: 'Can I get my drug approved? Can I get it to market effectively before the patent expires?'

Commercial Cloud grew in fiscal 2017 on major CRM wins and amid expansions at top 20 pharmaceutical firms, Veeva said in its earnings news release. The business accounts for two-thirds of Veeva's sales, Gassner estimates.But it's Veeva's second act that really has Wall Street keyed up, he said.Veeva Vault was launched in 2011 with a single customer and the goal of organizing all content involved in clinical trials — documents, videos, images and data records. Vault represents about a third of Veeva's total sales and targets a $4 billion total-addressable market, Gassner said.He sees Vault as the reason for recent excitement around Veeva stock. Shares are up 29% since January and, on March 13, burst out of a cup-with-handle formation that began in November, topping a 45.95 buy point on a deeper Salesforce partnership. The stock is now more than 14% extended from that point.From a bottom of 17.11 in May 2014 — seven months after Veeva's IPO — to an all-time intraday high of 53.37 reached Friday, shares gained nearly 212%. Shares ultimately retreated by Friday's close, but were up again Monday, gaining 1.4% to close at 52.55.In 2011, Vault brought in under $10 million in sales, Gassner said. Today, Vault's annualized run rate is north of $220 million.As a whole, Veeva is aiming to top a $1 billion annualized run rate in 2020, and Veeva is already tracking ahead of that, says Cornelio Ash, analyst at William O'Neil & Co., an affiliate of Investor's Business Daily.Now, Vault is prepping for a potential third act by looking for opportunities outside life sciences — a first for Veeva. Gassner says Veeva could see an additional $1 billion opportunity in taking Vault to other manufacturing-heavy industries like chemicals and consumer packaging.O'Neil's Ash says success in that venture will be a ""game-changer"" for Veeva.""What that would be saying is they've got a lockdown on the steps,"" he told IBD. ""Then it just becomes, what door do they want to knock down? The potential is there. That's probably why (Veeva stock) continues to trade at a premium.""Gassner says Veeva will gain traction outside life sciences using the same method it employed in 2007 and 2011 when it launched its major Commercial Cloud and Vault divisions. Inside the company it's called ""the Veeva way.""The method worked in life sciences, after all. Veeva has an estimated 50%-60% of the CRM market. And though its sales in clinical trials and regulatory processes match Medidata's, that's 100% of Medidata's sales vs. a small — and growing — chunk of Veeva's.""Your brand becomes what you're good at,"" Gassner said. ""If we become good at delivering this value outside life sciences, then I think over time we'll become known for that.""To that end, Veeva is part of a collaboration that includes AstraZeneca (AZN), Allergan (AGN), Biogen (BIIB), Lilly, Novartis, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), Pfizer and others called Align Biopharma. Align is aiming to iron out the technological standards for the life sciences world.Veeva could do the same in a sector outside of the life sciences, Ash said.""That's literally getting feedback from the horse's mouth of how they should develop the platform,"" he said. ""To me, to be successful outside that, they're going to need that same kind of feedback in other sectors.""RELATED:IBD 50 Company Breaks Out After Deepening Salesforce Tie-UpVeeva Helps The Medicine Go Down For Drug Giants

123,LLY,"Drug stocks toppled to a five-month low Tuesday after Dow component Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) reported first-quarter pharma sales that only advanced 0.8%, offering a weak harbinger for the sector.In late afternoon trading on the stock market today, IBD's 43-company Ethical Drugs industry group was down a fraction after earlier losing as much as 1.4%, touching a low not seen since November.Biotech stocks were less injured, but were still down 1.2% after collectively losing as much as 1.8% after J&J reported light first-quarter sales, despite a 6-cent beat on the bottom line.Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges says J&J's results highlight ""multiple Q1 issues for large biotechs."" Worldwide pharma sales of $8.25 billion grew just 1% vs. the year-earlier quarter and missed expectations by 1%.International drug sales beat by 2%, but U.S. pharma sales missed by 5%, Porges wrote in a research report. Oncology sales led growth while legacy products — Remicade, Stelara and Xarelto — offset volume declines or low growth with price hikes.Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN), AbbVie (ABBV) and Celgene (CELG) — which derive a large portion of sales from international markets — should benefit if J&J's worldwide pharma growth is reflected across the sector. Porges has an outperform rating on Alexion stock and market perform ratings on AbbVie and Celgene stocks.IBD'S TAKE: IBD's Ethical Drugs industry group is now ranked No. 161 out of 197 groups tracked, up from No. 182 just 13 weeks ago. But the biotech industry group is performing much better, ranked seventh this week. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a list of the strongest stocks.But higher utilization of independent patient assistance programs, timing of Medicare Part D costs and higher drug access discounts will leave Celgene and Amgen (AMGN) vulnerable among biotechs, Porges said, citing commentary by J&J. He has a market perform rating on Amgen stock.""While pricing power appears to remain strong, J&J did report that lower prices in government managed care channels impacted annual comparisons,"" he wrote. ""We do not anticipate that these issues will be isolated to J&J alone, but should impact the broader biopharma industry.""For drugmakers, Evercore analyst Umer Raffat noted J&J's struggle in its diabetes unit — Invokana sales were down 17% year over year — could be reflected in Eli Lilly's (LLY) diabetes franchise. Though Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez earlier said the unit could help Lilly overcome struggles with its rheumatoid arthritis drug.Raffat noted pricing pressure for cardiovascular drug Xarelto could be reflected in Bristol-Myers Squibb's (BMY) Eliquis. Xarelto sales fell 9.5% vs. the year-earlier period.As a silver lining, J&J reported 56.7% year-over-year growth for Imbruvica, a cancer drug in partnership with AbbVie. The companies are now looking to have Imbruvica approved to treat patients suffering from graft-versus-host disease — which can occur when foreign tissue is introduced into the body via organ transplants.RELATED:Dow's Johnson & Johnson Sets Up Lackluster Results For SectorCan Lilly Survive Rheumatoid Arthritis Flop With Breast Cancer Drug?

124,LLY,"Many parts of President Trump's federal government have yet to take shape, but a leaner and meaner Food and Drug Administration seems almost certain.The way agency watchers see it, Trump's ""blueprint"" for the nation's pharmaceutical gatekeeper points to a funding cut. His budget outline also suggests that the user fees charged to the industry, for processing approvals, could as much as double in 2018.Yet Trump also wants a speedier FDA that pushes through more generic drugs, boosting competition. He has derided ""astronomical"" and ""outrageous"" drug prices and called for a competitive and fair drug-approval process.Drugmakers and analysts say they're all for it. They're just not sure a leaner FDA can accomplish that.""If we can support the FDA to get more funding so they can approve generic drugs faster, it'll bring down drug costs,"" said John Maraganore, CEO at Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (ALNY).Alnylam makes expensive specialty drugs to treat hemophilia and other rare ailments. He acknowledges that more competition in the generic market would help tug down rising drug prices.""That's a competitive, marketplace-based way of doing it that would preserve the market-based, time-limited award that's really needed for innovation,"" Maraganore told Investor's Business Daily.Irina Koffler, analyst at Mizuho, agrees. The FDA now faces a 4,000-drug backlog of generic applications, she told IBD.Before it can make a dent in that backlog, the agency needs more funding, more staff and legislation to clear out a thicket of laws and legal decisions that slow down drug approvals, Koffler says.""Generic submissions are sitting there languishing while there is not enough competition,"" Koffler said. ""There's some situations where you'll have a supply monopoly where one company is the only one manufacturing a certain generic drug and therefore charges a lot for it.""Biotech and drug stocks are touchy when it comes to Trump. A March 7 tweet from the president promising more drug competition sent IBD's 17-company Generic Drugs industry group down 1.2%.But generic drug companies actually favor more competition, says Chip Davis, chief executive for the Association for Accessible Medicines, an advocate for makers of generic drugs.Makers of generic and what are known as biosimilar drugs experience constant price deflation, he says. That backlog of 4,000 generic applications means drugs that could provide new revenue streams stay stuck on hold, awaiting FDA review or action.""The only way that over time our companies can be financially successful is if they are able to get approvals for new generics to help offset the continuing deflation that they see year over year, in their current mature portfolio,"" he told IBD. ""They fully recognize more competition creates downward pressure on pricing.""Prescription drug prices rose 11.3% in 2016, and they're projected to jump 11.6% this year for active employees and early retirees from the American workforce, according to advisory firm Segal Consulting. For retirees age 65 and older, prices are expected to rise 9.9% — a slowdown from 10.9% in 2016.It likely will take a congressional push to speed up FDA approvals. The most recent iteration of the American Health Care Act, the GOP bill that sought to replace ObamaCare, didn't touch pharmaceuticals, though Trump pledged March 20 in a Kentucky rally to work on legislation to bring down pricing.IBD'S TAKE: Since his swearing in, Trump has continued calls for drugmakers to lower their prices. What would this do to biotech and drug stocks? Read on in IBD's Industry Themes.Trump's 2018 budget blueprint hints at ""a package of administrative actions designed to achieve regulatory efficiency and speed the development of safe and effective medical products.""Trump could be on the same page with Alnylam's Maraganore, who imagines a system of FDA incentives to approve generics quickly.Congress could enact ""legislation where the FDA is incentivized to approve a second or third manufacturer for a generic drug faster,"" Maraganore said. ""You can imagine how that would help speed lowering of drug prices if the FDA has to prioritize the second and third drug approvals over other generic drug actions.""What Trump should not do is reduce drug testing for safety and effectiveness, Mizuho's Koffler says.She recalled the Thalidomide crisis of the 1950s and 1960s. Thalidomide was first marketed in Germany as an over-the-counter medication for nausea in pregnant women. In the ensuing years, some 100,000 children worldwide were born with phocomelia, or malformed limbs. About half survived.That was a turning point in the drug approval process, Koffler says. Thalidomide wasn't well-tested before being sold to a vulnerable population of pregnant women and resulted in unexpected side effects in newborns. Because of that, the FDA strengthened its drug review process.""With any drug you're taking, you have to assume what terrible things could happen: A child could take it, a pregnant woman could take it, a person who has bad kidneys or a bad heart will take it,"" she said. ""So you have to test these drugs in a more realistic and representative population of patients.""Trump's pick for FDA commissioner, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, has talked about overhauling the FDA's process for generic complex drugs, which have allowed some branded drugs to create ""monopolies in perpetuity."" Generic complex drugs have more complex active ingredients, formulations, routes of delivery or drug-device combinations than typical generics.Gottlieb is an industry insider who formerly held positions at the FDA and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. His nomination has drawn support across the aisle. Like Trump, Gottlieb supports more competition in the generic market while cutting down on branded monopolies.In a March 4 article in Forbes, Gottlieb noted that older generic drugs that should be sold cheaply are sometimes very costly. The prime example is Turing Pharmaceuticals' purchase of a decades-old HIV medicine in 2015. The company spiked the price to $750 a pill from $13.50 overnight.""This is often a result of failures in the way that FDA is regulating generic medicines,"" he said. ""The agency's long and costly approach to regulating generic drugs is reducing competition in the generic market and increasing the cost of manufacturing generic medicines.""Maraganore identifies more with the branded side of the aisle. He draws a distinction between generics and groundbreaking treatments. When the FDA approves a branded drug for a rare disease — like Biogen's (BIIB) Spinraza for spinal muscular atrophy — or even some of the new treatments coming out now that could actually cure cancer, the drugs receive patent protection for a number of years. Generics can't make copies in that period.Maraganore calls that the ""market-based, time-limited award needed for innovation.""The generic market ""is where there ought to be the greatest amount of competition,"" he said. ""As we address challenges in our system around drug prices and drug-approval processes, we need to be careful that reform that might look good or sound good is in fact good, to preserve the innovation engine we have in this country.""In January, Trump told execs from Celgene (CELG), Eli Lilly (LLY), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Novartis (NVS) and Merck (MRK) that he would cut 75%-80% of regulations to smooth the FDA approval process.According to the Regulatory Affairs Professionals Society, Trump pledged to ""streamline the process so that from your standpoint, when you actually have a drug, you can actually get it approved instead of waiting many, many years.""Mizuho's Koffler notes that at least one law could be revised. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 stays a generic drug application for 30 months, allowing the patent holder time to litigate against the generic filer and protect its patent. That 30-month clock is in place regardless of how dire the need is for the drug.""If you could legislate that stay away — that mandatory 30 months — that would help expedite the litigation process between the branded and generic companies and create a lot more competition,"" she said.Davis, of the generic drug makers' advocacy group, argues that Congress ought to tackle a decade-old law that requires the makers and the FDA to take additional safety measures when a drug could have risky side effects if not properly administered.Branded companies are taking advantage of the 2007 Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies law to prevent generics from purchasing samples of the drugs, he says.Davis contends that some companies have used risk evaluation programs ""to create a limited distribution program that doesn't allow generic companies to legally purchase samples of those drugs, which they need to do the clinical testing so they can submit an application to the FDA to compete against the originator product,"" he said.""There needs to be legislation to make sure (risk evaluation) can only be used for its intended purpose and not to delay competition from generics or biosimilars going forward,"" he said. A bill in the House now would just study the matter ""and the reality is everyone has known for five years this is a problem.""Trump's budget blueprint offers the clearest view yet of how he wants to run the FDA, but it doesn't clear away all the smoke.Trump argues that ""industries that benefit from FDA's approvals can and should pay for their share"" in a ""constrained budget environment."" But the proposal doesn't detail a specific 2018 budget figure for the FDA.In 2016, the FDA budget grew 9% to $4.9 billion. This year, the FDA has asked for an 8% increase to $5.1 billion. The industry is bracing for a potential cut to agency funding in 2018, indicated by the proposed jump in user fees.Under the law, the FDA collects fees from drugmakers — branded, generic and biosimilar — to fund the drug-approval process. Trump's blueprint proposes a boost in those fees to $2 billion.The agreed-upon user fee between the industry and FDA for 2018 isn't publicly available, says Davis, so it's difficult to know how it will mesh with Trump's blueprint. Those deals were formed over ""months and months of dialogue"" and both generics and biosimilars came away satisfied, he says.Trump's $2 billion blueprint likely includes branded, generic and biosimilars, which are set to pay $1.2 billion in fees this year. It's unclear whether Trump's plan includes other types of user fees. In all, FDA user fees amounted to $2.1 billion in 2017.The Alliance for a Stronger FDA — a coalition of consumer/patient groups, health professionals and trade associations — called Trump's user-fee jump ""neither wise nor realistic"" in a March 16 statement.""Not wise because FDA's core responsibilities — safe and effective medical products and safe foods — need to be supported in large measure by the public, who is the primary beneficiary,"" the group said. ""Not realistic because the drug and device industries have recently completed user fee agreement negotiations with FDA.""

125,LLY,"Eli Lilly (LLY), Merck (MRK) and Allergan (AGN) stand to outperform broad pharma stocks in 2017, a Credit Suisse analyst said Monday, citing their strong pipelines and expected clinical data this year.Merck stock closed down 1.5% at 64.15 on the stock market today. Shares of Allergan dipped 0.2% to 240.65, and Lilly finished 0.3% lower at 84.14. Drug stocks were down broadly, but stayed above their 50-day moving average.Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan expects macro uncertainty to pressure drug stocks in the first half of 2017, continuing a trend that began in 2016 with the raucous election season. Drug stocks ended 2016 down 27%, though are up 2.3% since January.Merck will outperform on Keytruda, its immuno-oncology drug, Divan said. Keytruda and similar drugs from Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and Roche (RHHBY) teach a patient's immune system to identify tumor cells. The immune system then destroys cancer.Keytruda goes head-to-head against Bristol-Myers Squibb's Opdivo in that both target a specific protein within the body. Merck is teaming up to test Keytruda with Incyte's (INCY) drug, epacadostat. Epacadostat targets another protein.IBD'S TAKE: Jazz Pharmaceuticals tops IBD's 43-company Ethical Drugs industry group with a Composite Rating of 78 out of a best-possible 99. The score means Jazz outperforms nearly two-thirds of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. Get the rest of the leaders list on IBD's Stock Checkup.Lilly's pipeline is now derisked, Divan wrote in a note to clients. He sees promise in diabetes drugs Jardiance and Trulicity, plaque psoriasis drug Talz, Lartruvo for soft tissue sarcoma, and baricitinib, a treatment for eczema.Sentiment on Allergan is finally starting to thaw, he wrote. He cited further upside to the pipeline from new drugs like Linzess and Viberzi for irritable bowel syndrome, as well as Vraylar for bipolar disorder.On the small- and midcap scene, Divan prefers Alder Biopharmaceuticals (ALDR), Corvus Pharmaceuticals (CRVS) and Aimmune Therapeutics (AIMT). Alder is working on a migraine medicine based on inhibiting a specific peptide within the body to eliminate migraines.Corvus is an ""underappreciated peer player,"" Divan said. RELATED:These Are The First Immune-System Cancer Drugs OK'd By FDAMerck, Bristol-Myers, Incyte Race For A Career In $25 Billion I-O Market

126,LLY,"Eli Lilly's (LLY) pipeline has the best ""bang-for-the-buck,"" one analyst said Wednesday in an R&D comparison pitting Lilly against rivals Pfizer (PFE), Merck (MRK) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY).Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez said Lilly is outperforming the pack, achieving the best balance in R&D investment while limiting external investments over the past five years. Bristol and Pfizer trail whereas Merck struggles on these metrics, he wrote.Still, drugmakers like Lilly have struggled to gain FDA approvals. Only 9%-22% of drugs from 2011 pharma pipelines have gained approval. By contrast, biotechnology companies AbbVie (ABBV) and Gilead Sciences (GILD) have been more successful with 36% and 40% conversion rates.Among the top drugmakers, Bristol-Myers and Lilly have had considerably more success with phase three drugs. Meanwhile, Pfizer has only converted 20% of its late-stage pipeline in 2011 to drugs sold on the market.Pfizer has the broadest pipeline in the group -- with 57 disclosed new drugs, Fernandez wrote. But it has struggled with fallen megamergers and R&D disruptions, limiting its scale on productivity. Merck is the lowest in the pharma universe with 30.IBD'S TAKE: American Funds recently upped its stake in Bristol-Myers Squibb stock. Who else received American Funds' vote of confidence? Find out at IBD's Mutual Funds page.In his analysis, Fernandez also looked at ""churn,"" the turnover of new drugs from 2011-15, and ""burn,"" the percentage of attrition of the 2011 portfolio by 2016. Bristol has the highest burn rate and lowest churn rate.""The company appears to be focusing more on internal assets/partnerships/early stage M&A over mid- to late-stage external agents,"" Fernandez wrote in a note. ""Conversely, Merck's churn rate is among the highest in the group.""Merck's ""high overall R&D expenses are driven in part by the large Cubist and Idenix deals, which have so far struggled to generate the sizable returns management had hoped (for), as well the company's extraordinary investment behind Keytruda,"" he wrote.Though Merck isn't alone in its struggles with partnerships and acquisitions. Among big drugmakers and biotechs, only Gilead's purchase of Pharmasset in 2011 appears to have succeeded, Fernandez wrote.Pharmasset began development on Sovaldi, the hepatitis C drug that rocketed Gilead's sales in 2014-15. But Gilead's hepatitis C franchise began faltering in 2016 amid the high cure rates of its trio of drugs, Sovaldi, Harvoni and Epclusa.At the closing bell on the stock market today, Lilly finished trading up 0.8% to 83.41. Bristol-Myers rose 1.4% to 57.12. Meanwhile, Merck slipped 0.2% to 65.80 while Pfizer also lost 0.2% to 33.91.RELATED:Gilead Hepatitis C Sales Plunge As Merck Swipes Share: AnalystAbbVie Stronger Bet Than Gilead, Amgen — At Least Until 2020: LeerinkMerck, Roche Gouge Bristol's I-O Share After Lung Cancer Approvals

127,LLY,"Two analysts downgraded Biogen (BIIB) stock Thursday as its prospects for being acquired were dimming and market forces took some air out of two of its key drugs.Biogen's prospects for finding a suitor are diminishing, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said, downgrading the stock to a market perform rating from outperform and cutting his price target to 300 from 305. Investment bank Morgan Stanley also downgraded the stock to equal weight from an overweight rating, and slashed its price target to 305 from 369.""What was previously mostly opportunity for Biogen's stock has now shifted to risk,"" Porges wrote in a note to clients.Further, competitors like Roche (RHHBY) are developing their own multiple-sclerosis drugs, squeezing Biogen's Tecfidera empire. And, payer pushback is slowing the launch of spinal muscular atrophy drug Spinraza. Plus, Biogen remains two years behind on developing an Alzheimer's drug.On the stock market today, Biogen stock crashed 4.7% to 278.96. Shares of Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS), Biogen's partner on Spinraza, fell as low as 39.32 after Leerink analyst Paul Matteis trimmed his price target on Ionis slightly. But Ionis Rallied to close up 0.6% at 41.72.Porges reduced his 2017 sales forecast for Biogen by 1% and sees 2%-3% lower sales in later years.IBD'S TAKE: Biogen's spinoff Bioverativ isn't your standard startup. Head to The New America to find out why.Biogen is currently entangled in patent litigation and interference over Tecfidera, which accounted for 45% of its total 2016 sales. In January, Biogen agreed to pay Forward Pharma (FDW) $1.25 billion to settle the suit.Still, the court processes are ongoing. Most potential outcomes seem ""more likely to favor Biogen's licensor, Forward Pharma, than Biogen,"" Porges wrote in a note. RBC analyst Michael Yee disagrees. Three of four outcomes could favor Biogen, he says.""If Biogen wins or has access to the patents via Forward to 2028, Biogen (stock) should go up a few percent, but notably the tail-value (net present value) goes up by $6 billion, or around $20-$25 or 7%-8% from the current share price,"" he wrote in a note.In the worst-case scenario, Biogen wins the interference case but loses the patent suit, and its stock might fall 5%-7% ""on headlines and worries on lower M&A interest, (or) pressure to do more deals,"" Yee said. Decisions in both cases are expected March 22.Meanwhile, Roche and generic competitors are likely to squeeze Tecfidera, analysts say. Roche's date to start paying fees to fund the approval process for primary progressive multiple sclerosis drug Ocrevus is March 28.""Reality is (the) Street is a bit nervous how the drug will impact/reduce Biogen core multiple sclerosis sales,"" Yee said. Ocrevus could have an impact on Biogen's Tysabri, a relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis drug.Analysts seemingly agree that the opportunity on Spinraza is strong, but note that pushback from payers is slowing its launch. Biogen and Ionis' drug was approved in December. Very few physicians have prescribed Spinraza, Leerink's Matteis said.""From the half a dozen centers we have contacted so far, the most common response has been, 'We haven't started anyone yet, but we plan to,' "" he wrote. ""This comes as a surprise to us given the magnitude of unmet medical need and the drug's compelling clinical data.""Biogen's strategy has been to front-load the cost of Spinraza, which could have driven some payer scrutiny, Matteis wrote. Payers appear to be taking their time establishing reimbursement policies for Spinraza, he said.Investors will have to wait two years for data on Biogen's Alzheimer's disease program. Biogen is working on aducanumab, a drug that works to remove plaque buildup in the brain associated with Alzheimer's.But the theory didn't pan out with Eli Lilly's (LLY) solanezumab. Analysts widely expected solanezumab to prove effective in a late-stage trial. It failed. Biogen's trial in Alzheimer's might be pivotal, but it's also ""risky, expensive and slow,"" Leerink's Porges said.RBC's Yee is more bullish. He sees Biogen's Alzheimer's pipeline as having ""big, long-term optionality."" Yee rates Biogen stock with an outperform rating and has a 350 price target on shares.RELATED:Kite, Ionis Outplay Med Sector As Perrigo, Tenet, Valeant DiveMerck's Biogen Drug Fails; Are Biogen, Roche, AstraZeneca Next?Falling Biotechs: Cara Reports Zero Sales, Ionis Downgraded

128,LLY,"An aerospace industry group sent a letter to congress Friday backing Republican plans to overall the tax system as member and Dow Jones industrial average component Boeing (BA) will break ground on a new finishing plant in China by the end of the month.""We urge you to enact legislation that modernizes our tax system, allows America's businesses to better compete in the global marketplace and encourages job creation and innovation in the United States,"" the Aerospace Industries Association of America said in its letter to congress said according to Reuters.In a letter made public by the AIA, the group said the proposed House corporate tax reform blueprint would ""benefit American businesses and American workers across the board.""The blueprint would lower the corporate tax rate to 20% from 25% and would add a border adjustment tax.Last month Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg, Dow industrials peer General Electric (GE) CEO Jeffrey Immelt, and other industrial exporters along with drugmakers Celgene (CELG), Eli Lilly (LLY) and others wrote their own letter to congress urging support for the bill.Boeing has a lot to gain from the proposed tax overhaul. Morgan Stanley (MS) analysts released a note Monday saying that Boeing's stock could jump 40% from the border adjustment tax alone.Boeing shares were down 0.2% to 178.73 on the stock market today. GE stock fell 1.1% to 29.54.Not all businesses support the House's blueprint. Wal-Mart (WMT), another Dow stock, strongly opposes a border adjustment tax, along with most retailers whose goods would become more expensive.Wal-Mart shares were up 1.1% to 70.72, retaking their 200-day moving average.While the tax blueprint is supposed to support jobs at home, Boeing will break ground on its finishing plant in Zhoushan by the end of March, according to a report from China's business media outlet Caixin out Tuesday.Boeing announced plans for the facility to finish 737s and started preliminary work in 2015 as it looks to build market share in the rapidly growing aerospace market. The workers at the plant will paint planes and install in-flight entertainment and other systems.While some work is being outsourced to China, Boeing has argued the plant will create more, not less, American jobs.""That finishing center is a location where we can add value in China, but every airplane that goes there is built in the U.S.,"" CEO Dennis Muilenburg said in January. ""It's a great example of how growth in China creates growth in U.S. manufacturing jobs.""RELATED:Why Trump's 10% Tariff Idea Isn't BAT CrazyBusinesses Big And Small 'Enthusiastic' About Trump Economic PoliciesTreasury Might Write Checks To Boeing Under GOP Tax Reform

129,LLY,"The biotech industry has a mixed outlook for 2017 with few new drugs coming to market this year, but midcap Incyte (INCY) is one of the few companies with potential blockbusters in its pipeline.Incyte closed out 2016 and started 2017 with some major developments. The first came late last year when the company discovered that its Jakafi drug won't be facing competition from Gilead (GILD) in 2018 as previously expected. Jakafi is used to treat two maladies: myelofibrosis, a bone marrow disorder, and polycythemia vera, a type of blood cancer.Gilead's rival drug to Jakafi, now known as momelotinib, failed a Phase 3 study for previously untreated myelofibrosis patients in November. That left Incyte's primary revenue driver free of competition for the foreseeable future, according to Ian Somaiya, a biotech analyst at BMO Capital Markets.""It's rare to see a drug that can generate $2.5 billion to $3 billion (in sales) and face no competition,"" he said of Jakafi's peak sales potential. In its most recent earnings report, Incyte officials said Jakafi accounted for $224 million in net product revenue in the third quarter, up 39% from the year before. The company raised its full-year net sales outlook on the drug to $850 million-$855 million from an earlier outlook of $825 million-$835 million.Morgan Stanley analysts said in a note to clients Tuesday that they see the drug's revenue growing 13% a year.Then earlier this month, Incyte announced its immuno-oncology drug, epacadostat, along with Merck's (MRK) Keytruda, will be used in four Phase 3 studies this year. They include treatment of non-small lung cancer as well as renal, bladder and head and neck cancers.""The opportunities in solid tumors could be a (earnings) multiplier"" for epacadostat, Somaiya said.If the drug passes the trials and receives Food and Drug Administration approval, analysts expect $1.6 billion in peak sales, according to a recent Goldman Sachs note.Morgan Stanley analysts said in their note that they expect key data from the studies that prompted the companies to start a Phase 3 trial will be disclosed at the American Society of Clinical Oncology conference in Chicago in June.""Epacadostat has the potential at least to be one of the biggest pipeline drugs,"" said Eric Schmidt, biotechnology analyst at Cowen. ""It could be active against so many tumor types.""Finally, on Jan. 13 the FDA extended its review period of baricitinib, and investigational rheumatoid arthritis drug jointly developed by Incyte and Eli Lilly (LLY). But Morgan Stanley took that as a bullish sign that the FDA didn't ask for any new studies and sees ""imminent approval.""Still, analysts lowered its U.S. sales estimates for the drug to $98 million from $197 million for the 2017 on the delay. Yet they see peak sales of $1.8 billion in 2026.Management has played a key role in Incyte's success in recent years. Incyte Chief Executive Herve Hoppenot, who took the helm in 2014, was previously the president of oncology at Novartis (NVS). Many scientists on the oncology side followed Hoppenot to Incyte.""What always made Incyte unique is the expertise in biology,"" Somaiya said. ""With the management changes, you have that expertise to develop those drugs, conduct larger trials, bring those drugs to the market and independently market them.""But analysts question how much longer the company will remain independent. Incyte is the largest midsize company in the oncology space and a potential buyout target.The endgame for most biotechs is to be bought by a larger pharmaceutical firm that has a ""less fruitful pipeline"" according to Michael Schmidt, senior biotech analyst at Leerink Partners. He is no relation to Cowen's Eric Schmidt.IBD'S TAKE: Incyte is ranked second in IBD's Medical-Biomed/Biotech Group and has a 94 composite rating. Shares jumped into buy range out of a flat base with a 110.05 buy point on Jan. 9, after the company announced its drug trails for epacadostat.""Oncology pipelines are very interesting from an M&A standpoint. There's scarcity of companies that have a good pipeline,"" Michael Schmidt said. But he wouldn't speculate on what companies could be interested in Incyte.In a September poll by the Evercore ISI investment bank, analysts voted Gilead as the most likely to buy out Incyte in the next 12 months.Despite President Donald Trump calling out the drug industry over ""disastrous"" drug prices, merger activity could heat up this year. Under a Trump administration, there could be changes in the tax code, as well as a possible boost in foreign cash and increased stock valuations, according to a Reuters report.While Incyte is poised for a successful 2017, the biotech world isn't without risks.""Beyond the traditional drug development risks, there is always regulatory risks,"" Michael Schmidt said. ""And oncology is obviously a competitive space, particularly immuno-oncology.""But Cowen's Eric Schmidt said he's not worried about competition in the oncology sector.""There is too much unmet need, too many patients are dying,"" he said, adding that valuation is the prime risk.""The biggest risk is that there is a fair bit of good news priced into Incyte,"" he said. ""So if something goes wrong valuation could come in and correct a lot.""Shares of Incyte seemed ready to hit a third straight day of gains, but met resistance after crossing the 120 mark on Friday. Shares ended Monday's session up marginally to 117.42.RELATED: FDA Track Record Bodes Well For Merck Keytruda Plus Chemo: LeerinkAmgen Plans Robust 2017 In Alzheimer's, Migraines, Oncology: CEO Exclusive

130,LLY,"Eli Lilly (LLY) stock popped to a three-week high Thursday — its highest point since terminating a key Alzheimer's program in November — on its Wall Street-topping 2017 sales and earnings guidance.Early Thursday, Lilly guided to $21.8 billion to $22.3 billion in 2017 sales, topping the consensus of 21 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters for $21.67 billion. Lilly also sees $4.05 to $4.15 earnings per share ex items, beating analysts' model for $3.97.""This is the first time Lilly has provided initial guidance above the consensus on both metrics since we began tracking this in 2013,"" Evercore analyst John Scotti said in a research report. ""And of those years, only 2013 guidance was above consensus on EPS, not revenue.""IBD'S TAKE: Drug stocks have taken a hit recently on commentary by President-elect Donald Trump that he would go after spiraling drug prices.Eli Lilly management says Wall Street likely didn't account for the acquisition of Boehringer Ingelheim's animal health business, which is expected to pull in $200 million in 2017 sales.Lilly also expects exclusivity for chemotherapy Alimta next year in Japan and the U.S. and minimal generic competition in Europe. The consensus instead models a 10% year-over-year decline in the U.S. and a 16% dip in ex-U.S. sales.In the stock market today, Lilly stock jumped 5.5% to 71.37.Shares crashed to a two-year low Nov. 23 after Lilly said it would scrap its work on Alzheimer's drug solanezumab after it missed its primary endpoint in a late-stage trial.Shares are still trying to recover. Lilly stock has traded below its 50-day moving average since mid-November, reflecting a similar trend for IBD's 44-company Medical-Ethical Drugs industry group. The group, though, was up more than 1% Thursday morning.RELATED:Eli Lilly Continues Alzheimer's Push After Flop, Biogen Extends RiseBiogen Underplays Promising Alzheimer's Data On Seizure Worries

131,LLY,"Barclays analyst Geoff Meacham on Thursday said he expected Gilead Sciences' (GILD) 2017 outlook to be hindered on limited hepatitis C sales. He also sees Merck (MRK) and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) issuing sluggish views, though he is more bullish on Biogen (BIIB) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ).RBC Capital on Wednesday said much the same about Gilead, and also was more bullish on Biogen as well as on Amgen (AMGN).Hepatitis C drug prescriptions dipped 6%-7% quarter over quarter in Q4, according to market tracker IMS. Gilead makes Sovaldi and Harvoni to combat hepatitis C.Merck and Alexion, meanwhile, will guide to declining metrics on heavier spending and new management, respectively, Meacham predicted. ""Though we'd argue this is widely anticipated,"" Meacham said in a research report.He sees Biogen offering upside guidance on its Spinraza launch with Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS), and Johnson leveraging cost controls to offer a better 2017 view.IBD'S TAKE: As hepatitis C sales fall, where will Gilead go? Check out IBD's Industry Themes for the full scoop on how biotech's five biggest are expected to do in Q4.Ahead of the Q4 pharma earnings season, which starts next week with reports from companies such as J&J, Stryker (SYK) and Intuitive Surgical (ISRG), Meacham boosted his price target on Incyte (INCY) stock, noting that company's phase three tumor efforts with Merck. The duo are testing immunotherapy Keytruda and epacadostat in four tumors.Meacham expects Incyte, in its Q4 earnings conference call, to give some color on Jakafi trials in graft vs. host disease, as well as its tumor efforts with Merck. He bumped his price target on Incyte stock to 135 from 105. Incycte hasn't yet set a date for its Q4 earnings report.Incyte stock, which last week touched a 14-month high just shy of 119, rallied 2% to close at 117.53 in the stock market today.For Q4, the consensus of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expects Incyte to report $324.8 million in sales and 14 cents earnings per share, up a third and down 52%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier quarter.Merck's spending is likely ramping on Keytruda which was granted priority review last week in combination with Eli Lilly's (LLY) chemotherapy Alimta to treat non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in patients with a high expression of the PDL1 gene.Keytruda-plus-Alimta is in phase three testing. If data are strong, Merck could open itself up to a larger patient population vs. the 25%-30% of patients with a 50%-plus PDL1 expression. Keytruda is already approved as a monotherapy in high-expressing PDL1 patients with NSCLC.RELATED:Merck, Biogen, Lilly Top 2016 Approvals Despite FDA SlumpTrump's 'Disastrous' Pharma View Doesn't Rattle JPMorgan Drug ConferenceWill Trump Break With Republicans And Push Major Drug Reform?

132,LLY,"Drugmaker Eli Lilly (LLY) will likely add a rheumatoid arthritis drug to its FDA-approved repertoire this month, says Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan, who also predicts a court decision on Lilly's chemo drug Alimta ""any day now.""The Prescription Drug Free User Act (PDUFA) date for Lilly's baricitinib is set for January. The drug belongs to a class of meds called JAK (Janus kinase) inhibitors. Eli Lilly submitted its New Drug Application, or NDA, last January for moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis.Lilly gained worldwide rights to Incyte's (INCY) baricitinib in 2009. Now, Baricitinib competes against tofacitinib, a JAK inhibitor developed by Pfizer (PFE) and the National Institutes of Health marketed as Xeljanz and Jakvinus.Incyte is also codeveloping ruxolitinib, a JAK inhibitor targeting myelofibrosis, with Novartis (NVS).IBD'S TAKE: President-elect Donald Trump caused a flurry in drug stocks late last year when he pledged to cut down on spiraling drug prices. Will he made good on that promise?Other catalysts in January include separate patent rulings in the cases of Lilly's Alimta and also for Teva Pharmaceuticals' (TEVA) copaxone, an immunosuppressant for patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.Also in January, AstraZeneca (AZN) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) are likely to have some key trial data, Divan said.AstraZeneca is studying durvalumab, which has a breakthrough designation in treating patients with a specific type of urothelial bladder cancer. Bristol-Myers is looking at nivolumab to treat patients with non small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).At the close on the stock market today, IBD's 43-company Medical-Ethical Drugs industry group, which includes Lilly, Bristol-Myers and AstraZeneca, finished the day up nearly 1%. Lilly stock, though, ticked up just 0.2% to 74.72.RELATEDLilly Spikes On 2017 Guidance; Clawing Back From Alzheimer's Drug FlopBiogen Underplays Promising Alzheimer's Data On Seizure WorriesEli Lilly Continues Alzheimer's Push After Flop; Biogen Extends Rise
"
133,LLY,"Expect 2017 to mark a high point for Amgen (AMGN), says company CEO Robert Bradway.Shares of the No. 1 biotech by market cap fell nearly 10% in 2016, but the stock has still outperformed IBD's 421-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group, which tumbled nearly 25%.   But Bradway sees better days ahead.Amgen, for example, has data on a cardiovascular drug slated for release in Q1, a generic chemotherapy up for approval in the U.S. and Europe. It also expects to compete robustly in the anti-CGRP migraine market vs. rivals such as Alder BioPharma (ALDR), Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) and Eli Lilly (LLY).Below, grab the highlights of an emailed Q&A with Bradway examining trends and catalysts for the 2017 biotech industry, where he falls on President-elect Donald Trump's proposals and how Amgen plans to compete in the emerging immuno-oncology market:IBD: What catalysts does Amgen see for the biotech industry in 2017, and how will Amgen benefit?Bradway: Innovation is thriving in our industry. We are on the cusp of a true revolution in biology. We expect to see major improvements in immune therapies and novel agents based on human genomics. These and other advances will help many patients with serious diseases like cancer, cardiovascular disease and Alzheimer's disease, and will further accelerate long-term growth for both Amgen and the industry. As a world leader in biology, Amgen is ideally positioned to capitalize on these developments.IBD: Will any sectors do particularly well in 2017?Bradway: We believe that innovators bringing products with strong value propositions in disease states where the unmet medical need remains high will be winners in the near and long term.IBD: Does Amgen have any key launches or clinical trial data coming in 2017?Bradway: Yes, Amgen expects to bring forward an ambitious portfolio of new products and indications worldwide in 2017, as well as significant new clinical data. Our focus remains on addressing unmet medical needs with innovative medicines that make a difference for patients with serious disease. Our next wave of new medicines and key data is set to do just that.We anticipate results from our large cardiovascular outcomes trial in the first quarter of 2017. These results will be significant for Repatha (evolocumab) and can definitively establish the importance of this therapy for those at risk of cardiovascular disease.In neuroscience, we've already reported successful studies for erenumab, our CGRP (calcitonin gene-related peptide) migraine medicine, in both chronic and episodic migraine. This is a potentially life-changing medicine for migraine sufferers and we are pleased to be in the lead position in the CGRP class. We anticipate filing for approval with global regulators in 2017.In 2016, Parsabiv (etelcalcetide) was granted marketing authorization by the European Commission for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in adult patients with chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis. Parsabiv is the first calcimimetic agent that can be administered intravenously by a health care provider three times a week at the end of a hemodialysis session. We are working with the FDA toward approval in the U.S.Our biosimilars portfolio includes nine biosimilars in various stages of development. In 2016, our first biosimilar, Amjevita (adalimumab-atto), was approved in the U.S. We also filed AMG-215, our biosimilar to bevacizumab, for approval in the U.S. and Europe.IBD: How does Amgen see itself stacking up against rivals in 2017?Bradway: We enter 2017 following two years in which we launched six new products and saw approvals in the past year for 94 new products and indications in worldwide markets. Our strong performance is reflected in our financials as well: Over the past three years, on a GAAP basis, we have grown earnings by 50% as margins have increased by 10 percentage points and we have grown the dividend by 113%.This progress was achieved even (amid) the effects of patent expiries on our legacy products. We believe that, through our transformation program, which we announced over two years ago, Amgen is well-positioned to be an industry leader in speed, innovation, responsiveness to change, and financial performance. Meanwhile, we continue to investigate collaboration opportunities where we can offer our expertise in domains like human genetics, a tool kit of multiple molecular pathways and biologics manufacturing to help advance programs in our therapeutic areas of interest.IBD: What sets Amgen's immunotherapy, anti-CGRP, and BACE inhibitor therapies apart from rivals' drugs?Bradway: The approval of BLINCYTO (blinatumomab) validated the science and regulatory pathway for our bispecific T-cell engager (BiTE) antibody constructs, while also demonstrating efficacy for patients with a challenging disease, acute lymphoblastic leukemia. We believe this novel immuno-oncology platform represents an attractive way to engage immune cells and tumor cells and establish local anti-tumor immune activity where it is needed most. We also believe that BLINCYTO's mechanism can be replicated to harness the immune system to fight other tumor types.Erenumab, under co-development by Amgen and Novartis (NVS), is specifically designed to prevent migraine by blocking the CGRP receptor, which is believed to have a critical role in reducing the incapacitating pain of migraine. Almost 2,200 patients with chronic and episodic migraine have participated in three erenumab clinical trials, which will form the basis for our global regulatory filings. We are also exploring a PAC-1 bispecific antibody, AMG-301, in phase-one studies with the potential to be synergistic to erenumab.Amgen was the first to clone and characterize BACE in the late 1990s and subsequently identified corroborating human genetic evidence of its link to Alzheimer's disease. This paved the way for our collaboration with Novartis focusing on a differentiated and genetically validated Alzheimer's disease program directed at individuals genetically predisposed to the risk of developing the disease.Our deCODE Genetics subsidiary gives Amgen an industry-leading ability to identify and validate disease targets in human populations.IBD: How does Amgen expect the drug pricing debate to unfold in 2017?Bradway: There is sure to be more debate on drug pricing.  However, we must not lose sight of the fact that it is the economic and societal burden of disease that is the enemy in the room, and innovative biopharmaceutical drugs offer the promise of addressing that burden.To advance promising new medicines, we must keep an eye to both the price and the value of these therapies. We expect that our products need to deliver clear benefit to patients and our customers. To that end, Amgen has value-based contracts in place with a number of payers already, and we expect to do more. Medicines that deliver value and solutions for patients in need should be rewarded; those that don't should not.IBD'S TAKE: Donald Trump's pledge to take on drug prices stopped a long-running rally in the industry. Will he make good on his promise?IBD: Any other key thoughts that could be telling for biotech and 2017?Bradway: Amgen is approaching the development of promising new medicines with greater understanding, speed and confidence than ever before. In part, this is because our industry has unprecedented genetic information available on a large scale, a diverse array of drug pathways, and more sophisticated analytic tools that allow scientists to connect the dots between DNA and treating disease.Innovation is now evident at virtually every stage in the process of getting a medicine to market. This is an exciting time for the field and those who believe in the power of innovation.RELATED:Alder Keels For Sixth Day After EU Upholds Teva Migraine PatentRegeneron Likely To Jump On Regeneron LDL-Buster, But Expectations Too High

134,LLY,"Incyte's (INCY) oncology program will grow on a Merck (MRK) partnership tying Keytruda and epacadostat in four ""hot"" tumors in 2017, Leerink analyst Michael Schmidt said Friday as he boosted his price target on Incyte stock.Schmidt has an outperform rating on Incyte stock and upped his price target to 131 from 115 to reflect the epacadostat opportunity. On the stock market today, Incyte stock lifted a fraction to 117.75. Earlier, shares rose as much as 1.9% and neared a 15-month high achieved Tuesday.The announcement was made Monday during the annual JPMorgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco. Merck and Incyte have tested their combo on nine types of tumors. Data in MSI-high colorectal cancer and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma are not yet available.Keytruda and epacadostat won't advance in ovarian cancer nor triple-negative breast cancer. But the duo will continue to work in melanoma, bladder, kidney, lung, head and neck cancers, according to the companies' announcement Monday.IBD'S TAKE: Donald Trump referred to the pharma industry as ""disastrous"" and accused it of ""getting away with murder."" His comments overlapped with the annual JPMorgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco, where the tone was seen as ""cautiously optimistic.""
"
135,LLY,"Schmidt is bullish on Incyte's epacadostat opportunity. Phase 3 trials with Keytruda are likely to begin later this year. Thus far, the data have been ""unambiguous"" and researchers from both companies are comfortable with moving forward.Epacadostat belongs to a class of drugs that inhibit IDO1, a gene. IDO molecules are thought to allow tumor cells to escape detection by the immune system. Researchers are testing whether inhibiting the gene could assist in battling certain cancers.Questions remain as to the extent of the partnership, Schmidt said.""It is unclear whether Merck will opt-in to co-fund the planned trials and whether a period of exclusivity will be granted to Merck before Incyte may initiate additional phase three trials in potentially overlapping indications with another PD1 inhibitor,"" he wrote in a note.Merck is also working with Eli Lilly (LLY) in combining Keytruda and the chemotherapy Alimta to treat non-small cell lung cancer. The opportunity for epacadostat is NSCLC depends on a development strategy and competition, Schmidt said.But Merck is well-positioned in the market. It will likely beat rivals Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and AstraZeneca (AZN) to the market with an immuno-oncology plus chemo treatment. Analysts note that Bristol-Myers could creep up on Merck with an IO plus IO combo.Merck stock rose a fraction Friday, rising 3.7% for the week.RELATED:Eli Lilly Rebounds On Chemo-Drug Patent Win Vs.

136,LLY,"Eli Lilly (LLY) could benefit to the tune of $1.7 billion in 2025 on expanded Jardiance sales, Evercore analyst John Scotti said Friday after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved another indication for the diabetes drug.In the stock market today, Lilly stock jumped 2.6% to 67.71, following the FDA decision. But shares still are down 13% since Nov. 22, when Lilly announced its Alzheimer's drug solanezumab had failed to significantly improve on cognition.On Friday, the FDA approved Lilly's new drug application (NDA) for Jardiance to be used in reducing cardiovascular mortality in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Cardiovascular death is 70% higher in adults with diabetes than adults without, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Lilly co-developed Jardiance with Germany's Boehringer Ingelheim.IBD'S TAKE: As Eli Lilly stock tanked last week, Apple stock retook a buy point and FANG stocks surged ahead. Make sure to keep tabs on IBD's Week In Review for leading and lackluster stocks each week.Bottom line, the indication allows Lilly to promote Jardiance for its CV reduction qualities vs. having them buried in the data, Scotti wrote in a research report. But it's somewhat controversial. In June, an advisory committee voted 12-to-11 to allow Lilly to promote the CV side.""The narrow vote clearly reflects the committee's mixed feelings of whether EMPA-Reg CVOT (cardiovascular outcome trial) provided substantial evidence that the drug reduces CV mortality in the population studied,"" Scotti wrote.Regardless, the expanded indication for Jardiance bodes well for Lilly and the entire SGLT-2 class, Scotti says. SGLT-2s are proteins involved in glucose reabsorption in the kidneys. Inhibitors, like Jardiance, lead to a reduction in blood glucose.Lilly anticipates further indications, expected in 2017, to be catalysts for Jardiance sales, Scotti said.RELATED:

139,LLY,"Eli Lilly (LLY) on Friday announced a further collaboration with AstraZeneca (AZN) on a second Alzheimer's compound after giving an autopsy of its own, failed late-stage drug late Thursday. Meanwhile, Biogen (BIIB) extended gains after rising Thursday on fresh upbeat phase 1 data for its treatment from a small study of early-stage Alzheimer's patients.Eli Lilly will pay AstraZeneca $30 million as part of their expanded alliance for a compound still in phase 1 trials. That's in addition to a compound in a stage three trial. It shows that Lilly isn't giving up on Alzheimer's treatments despite a major disappointment.Eli Lilly released detailed phase 3 solanezumab data at the CTAD event in San Diego Thursday evening. Late last month, Lilly stunned investors by releasing data showing its experimental Alzheimer's drug failed to show statistically significant cognitive improvement vs. a placebo. (Eli Lilly shares fell 10.5% on Nov. 23, with Biogen losing 3.8%. Merck (MRK), which has its own experimental treatment, verubecestat, fell fractionally that day after paring early losses.""The results of EXPEDTION3 are without question disappointing,"" said Eric Siemers, M.D., distinguished medical fellow at Lilly in a Thursday night release. ""However, Lilly remains committed to finding solutions for this devastating disease. We will continue to analyze study results and work with the external scientific community in the hopes of uncovering findings that will help shape and advance future Alzheimer's disease research.""In the detailed report, Lilly said plasma a-beta changes were similar to those seen in previous studies and statistically significant. Changes in amyloid deposition weren't significant.Cognitive decline slowed by 11% in the primary endpoint, not statistically significant. By other measurements, cognitive declined slowed by 13%, 15%, 14% and 7%, respectively.Lilly shares rose 0.9% in morning trade on the stock market today. AstraZeneca, which also got an analyst upgrade, climbed 2.3%. Biogen rose 4.2% early Friday, gapping above its 50-day line, after climbing 1.5% to 289.54 on Thursday, rebounding off their 200-day moving average.IBD'S TAKE: Biotech stocks initially rallied after the election, with investors relieved that Hillary Clinton would not be president. But with the populist Trump saying he'll take on pharma costs, biotechs have taken a round trip. Trump's pick to run the FDA will be key.Boosting doses of an experimental Alzheimer's treatment reduces the risk of brain swelling while still achieving key benefits, Biogen disclosed on Thursday.The stepped-up dosage regimen in aducanumab saw swelling in 35% of patients vs. 55% given a high, fixed dose, Biogen reported. The gradual regime still reduced amyloid plaques in the brain significantly vs. a placebo among 31 patients in the phase one trial data. It also halted mental decline in a similar fashion to fixed-dosage results.Biogen will release more data at a San Diego medical conference today.But there were secondary endpoints that ""directionally favored"" solanezumab, raising some hopes for Thursday night's presentation for Lilly's drug and the general line of research.RELATED:Eli Lilly Topples As Alzheimer's Darling Sola Fails; Biogen, Merck Down
"
140,LLY,"An interview with Time upon his selection as the news magazine's Man of the Year brought President-elect Trump's most definitive statements to date on drug prices: ""I'm going to bring down drug prices. I don't like what has happened with drug prices.""The incoming president, though, has been short on details. And many observers say his bigger focus will be to streamline the U.S. Food and Drug Administration drug approval process. That effort got a boost on Wednesday, the same day Trump's Time interview was published, when the U.S. Senate approved a bill aimed at speeding up approval for drugs and medical devices. President Obama is expected to approve the so-called 21st Century Cures bill.But just what actions Trump will take remain as unknown as any resolution to the issue of drug prices that, at times, jump exponentially despite the critical needs of patients.Trump has vowed to repeal President Obama's Affordable Care Act. And he's promised to ""drain the swamp"" of special interests in Washington that helped contribute to the rise of Big Pharma.Before the Time interview, though, he hadn't broached the drug pricing issue, which just after his election boosted drug stocks. The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnologg ETF (IBB) jumped 12.6% in the two days after the Nov. 8 election, but it's fallen 8% since. IBD's 421-company Biomed/Biotech industry group jumped 9.7% on Nov. 9, while the generic and ethical drug groups rose 7% and 5.7%, respectively. The groups have given back those gains.Trump can't ignore rising drug prices, says Trevor Williams, Penn Mutual Asset Management managing director. The trouble is that the businessman and reality TV star is a relative political enigma, Williams told IBD.""It's hard for me to see him being a champion (of lowering drug prices) in the same sense Hillary would have been because he's so focused on dismantling the ACA,"" Williams said. ""But with Trump not having a political history, it's really difficult to telegraph where he's going to go with it.""Some of his policy proposals, though, could be telling.Trump pledged in a ""Contract with the American Voter"" to fully repeal the ACA, better known as ObamaCare, within his first 100 days in office, replacing it with Health Savings Accounts. In that vein, he said he'll cut down on FDA ""red tape.""""There are over 4,000 drugs awaiting approval, and we especially want to speed the approval of life-saving medications,"" Trump wrote in his contract.Trump's crack at the FDA is nothing new, says Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan. Yet, in recent years the FDA has worked to expedite sorely needed drugs through its Fast Track Designation and with the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, which helps fund drugs quickly.Still, there is a backlog in approvals of generic drugs, Divan told IBD. Many proposals in the works have targeted making the approval process for generic drugs — cheaper drugs similar to drugs out long enough that they've lost their patent protection — much easier.Trump's platform would remove barriers to entry for ""safe, reliable and cheaper"" products. Trump could also allow broader and off-label use for a number of drugs, Penn's Williams said.His replacement plan for the ACA remains somewhat ambiguous. Trump has backed off earlier promises to fully repeal the act. For one, he says he'll maintain provisions that require insurers to cover patients with pre-existing conditions and let parents cover their children through age 26.Obama didn't touch pharmaceuticals much in his ObamaCare legislative centerpiece, says Divan, outside of requiring drugmakers to pay for some of the expanded health care coverage. If Trump completely does away with the ACA — which is unlikely, Divan says — some of those fees could disappear.""Backroom negotiations (for the ACA) let the companies come out reasonably well,"" Divan said. Repealing the ACA could put the cash from those fees back into drugmakers' pockets. Yet, Wall Street is anything but reasonably sure how Trump-care could affect biotech and drug firms.Trump doesn't appear to have any vendetta against pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), but drugmakers might. PBM tactics undercut Amgen (AMGN) and Eli Lilly (LLY) in Q3, prompting both stocks to topple in late October after Amgen offered dim 2017 views and Eli Lilly saw diabetes sales take a hit.PBMs are third-party administrators for commercial, government and Medicare health plans. PBMs use discounts and competition to keep drug prices low, which can help patients but raise conflicts with drugmakers.Amgen stock toppled nearly 10% on Oct. 25 after its Q3 sales of immunosuppressant Enbrel came in flat. The firm, though, said it doesn't expect any net selling price increases in 2017. The business will be driven on volume, Amgen executive Anthony Hooper said on the company's earnings conference call.IBD'S TAKE: Rebates chipped away at Amgen's Enbrel sales in Q3. What does this mean for the broader industry? Grab IBD's Industry Themes for a deeper look.Eli Lilly stock on Oct. 25 after its Q3 sales of diabetes drug Humalog fell 14% ""as higher volume was more than offset by lower realized prices,"" the company said in its earnings conference call, after EPS and revenue missed Wall Street targets.Trump's lack of commentary on PBMs could be telling, Divan told IBD. As it stands, the government is not involved in drug price negotiations. But Trump could work to change this in order to lower drug prices. That's not been a focus of Republicans, Divan says, though Trump is not your typical Republican.The question, he says, is whether ""the new administration willing to go after something (Big Pharma) politically to score some points with the general public?""Drug companies have their own views, of course. Merck (MRK) CEO Ken Frazier this month, in a Bloomberg interview, said his company has been ""restrained"" in raising prices.""There will always be an individual drug in an individual year that you can point to and say, 'That looks large in relation to others.' But if you look at the whole portfolio, you will see that Merck has tended to be rather restrained when it comes to drug prices,"" Bloomberg reported Frazier saying.Bloomberg also reported this month that Allergan (AGN) CEO Brent Saunders said Trump could ""be more vicious, more focused, on taking down whoever does something again"" in terms of spiking the price of a drug or drugs. Bloomberg had interviewed Saunders and Frazier after both appeared at the Forbes Healthcare Summit in New York on Dec. 1.There's no question patients have had it with high drug prices.The Kaiser Foundation found in September that 77% of Americans, up from 72% last year, believe drug prices are too high. Americans generally support requiring firms to release information on how prices are set and allowing the government to negotiate drug prices.Kaiser's survey followed a drug pricing controversy that erupted in September over Mylan (MYL) boosting its price on a pair of EpiPens to $600 from about $100 in 2007. Its CEO, Heather Bresch, was subjected to tough questioning at a House committee hearing.Last year, a similar controversy prompted Capitol Hill hearings involved Turing Pharmaceuticals and its former CEO, Martin Shkreli, involving big hikes on a decades-old HIV drug. Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) has also imposed huge hikes on drug prices.The U.S. Justice Department is investigating and is expected to file charges against some generic drug companies for price collusion before year's end.Yes, while analyst Divan says ""I don't think the issue is going away,"" he also says he sees fewer chances of big changes to drug pricing policies under Trump.RELATED:Pfizer's Q3 Sales Challenged By Eli Lilly, Novartis Amid Breakup BustEli Lilly Topples As Alzheimer's Darling Sola Fails; Biogen, Merck DownCelgene, Kite, Spark Look To Sidestep Lilly Alzheimer's FlopAlder Keels For Sixth Day After EU Upholds Teva Migraine Patent

142,LLY,"Dow Jones industrial average component Boeing (BA) was downgraded Monday but analysts are bullish that a proposed border tax could boost shares.Morgan Stanley (MS) downgraded Boeing to equal weight from overweight on ""light"" order flow, but raised its price target to 190 from 185. But the aerospace giant's shares could hit 250 if Congress passes a border adjustment tax. Back in December, Morgan Stanley analysts said Boeing could pay little or no corporate income tax via a BAT, and could even get Treasury to cut checks to the aerospace giant.President Trump has backed the idea of a border adjustment tax, but hasn't endorsed any specific version, including the House GOP plan.Separately, Boeing announced an order from CBD Aviation Lease Finance for 30 737 Max 8 airplanes. The order was previously unidentified on Boeing's website and is listed at $3.3 billion at current prices.Boeing shares reversed higher to close up 0.2% at 179.05 on the stock market today. European rival Airbus' (EADSY) U.S.-listed shares finished 0.3% lower.Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg, Dow industrials peer General Electric (GE) CEO Jeffrey Immelt, and other industrial exporters along with drugmakers Celgene (CELG), Eli Lilly (LLY) and others wrote a letter last month urging congressional support for the House corporate tax reform blueprint, which includes the border adjustment tax.But the border tax faces an uphill battle in Washington. Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) called the border tax ""Orwellian"" last month and said it would hit Arkansas-based Wal-Mart (WMT) and raise consumer prices. Sen.

143,LLY,"Eli Lilly (LLY) stock defied Q4 and 2016 earnings misses, which the company posted early Tuesday, instead popping on Street-crushing sales and on President Trump's pledge to ease drug regulations and cut taxes on businesses.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Lilly stock finished trading up 3.1% to 77.03. Shares are up nearly 5% year to date, compared with a 1.6% dip for IBD's 44-company Ethical-Drugs industry group. Early Tuesday, Trump met with Big Pharma execs and promised to cut regulations and ease the FDA process, while also again saying drug prices must be cut.For Q4, Lilly reported $5.76 billion in sales and 95 cents earnings per share ex items, up 7.3% and 22%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier quarter. Though sales topped analysts' view for $5.55 billion, EPS lagged by 3 cents.IBD'S TAKE: Other industries have catalyzed or tanked on Trump's commentary.

But $3.52 EPS ex items lagged by 3 cents, though was up 2.6%. vs. the year-earlier period.Evercore analyst Mark Schoenebaum credited the sales beats to better-than-expected sales of diabetes meds Humalog and Trulicity, and of erectile dysfunction drug Cialis. They beat by $65 million, $59 million and $37 million, respectively, he said.Lilly also guided to $4.05-$4.15 EPS ex items for 2017, which met the consensus for $4.10 and would be up 15.5% at the midpoint.RELATED:Celgene, Merck, Lilly Sit With Trump On His Calls To Manufacture In U.S.Pfizer Reports Lagging Q4 EPS; Rebounds On Trump CommentaryEli Lilly, Novartis Challenge Pfizer's Potential $8 Billion Breast Cancer Drug

144,LLY,"Merck (MRK) delivered a blow late Tuesday to the beta-amyloid theory behind Alzheimer's disease when its drug, verubecestat, failed in two clinical trials, showing ""virtually no chance of finding a positive effect.""But investors largely expected the phase two and phase three trials to fail, Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez said in a research report. At the closing bell on the stock market today, Merck stock was down 0.8% to 65.16.Shares of fellow Alzheimer's drugmakers split Wednesday. Eli Lilly (LLY) stock mustered a 1.8% gain to 80.25, while AstraZeneca (AZN) added 0.7% to 28.84. Biogen (BIIB) climbed 2.6% to 292.64, as Roche (RHHBY) lifted 1.6% to 30.16.Verubecestat belongs to a class of drugs called BACE inhibitors, which work by blocking production of B-amyloid in the brain, Evercore analyst Mark Schoenebaum explained. Drugmakers are exploring whether amyloid buildup in the brain causes Alzheimer's. Lilly and AstraZeneca, and Biogen in conjunction with Japan's Eisai, are working on this theory.This differs from drugs like Eli Lilly's now discontinued solanezumab, which targets plaque buildup. Two months ago, Lilly's drug failed in a late-stage trial. But unlike Merck's drug, investors had high hopes for solanezumab.IBD'S TAKE: Analysts predicted Gilead Sciences would suffer slowing hepatitis C drug sales. This week, those worries came to fruition. But what were the warnings signs? Dive into IBD's Industry Themes for a close look.The data monitoring committee found that verubecestat was safe but saw little to no evidence of ""any activity at all ... or perhaps even the BACE arm was worse,"" Leerink's Fernandez wrote.Merck will continue a trial of patients with prodromal Alzheimer's. Data from that trial is expected in February 2019.Biogen's aducanumab and Roche's gantenerumab and crenezumab aim to cut down on built-up plaque in the brain. Eli Lilly and AstraZeneca, and Biogen and Eisai, are teamed up on BACE inhibitors. Other theories center on earlier treatment, Schoenebaum noted.""It remains unclear where AD-related damage to the brain can be reversed through clearing plaque or preventing the creation of additional plaque,"" he wrote in a report. ""The failure of this study for futility will dampen enthusiasm for the mechanism.""Schoenebaum says the consensus expected $1.3 billion in peak adjusted sales of verubecestat for Merck.RELATED:Merck's Keytruda Sales Lag Without $40 Million In Deferred Revenue: AnalystBiogen Trails Merck, Lilly In Alzheimer's; Hemophilia Spinoff Begins TradingAbbVie, Merck Pressure Gilead's 2017 Hep C Unit; GSK Battles HIV Biz

145,LLY,"General Electric (GE) CFO Jeffrey Bornstein said Wednesday that some industries ""will sit on their hands waiting"" and not invest unless lawmakers deliver promised changes to taxes and regulations and provide more clarity on health care policy.The warning comes as House Republicans' corporate tax revamp is running into opposition in Congress, as more GOP lawmakers balk at a proposed import tax that's seen as a key piece of the overhaul. President Trump has yet to unveil his own tax plan. And while Trump also wants to repeal and replace ObamaCare, some Republicans have turned squeamish about sweeping changes to the health law.At the Barclays Industrial Select conference in Miami, Bornstein said he is ""reasonably confident"" that the changes will get passed in 2017, but said investors could be ""very disappointed"" if they aren't.""If we don't get corporate tax reform across the goal line in 2017,  if we don't provide some visibility to where health care is going in 2017, and if we don't deliver on all the regulatory changes the administration has talked about in 2017, I think we could end up in a very difficult place,"" he said.On Tuesday, GE CEO Jeffrey Immelt — along with CEOs from Boeing (BA), United Technologies (UTX) and other industrial exporters, as well as drugmakers Celgene (CELG), Eli Lilly (LLY), Merck (MRK) and Pfizer (PFE) — wrote a letter urging congressional support for the House's tax reform blueprint, which includes a border adjustment tax.A total of 16 companies signed the letter, but more than 100 companies (including Wal-Mart (WMT), Target (TGT) and Nike (NKE)) and dozens of trade groups have signed on to Americans for Affordable Products, a group created to oppose the import tax.GE shares fell 0.6% to 30.33 on the stock market today. Boeing shares were off 0.1%. United Tech rose 0.1%.Last month, as talk of repealing ObamaCare began ramping up, GE's Immelt also indicated that some customers could become more cautious.""If I took it by segment, the Affordable Care Act is getting the most attention in the media and by our customers,"" he said on a conference call after reporting mixed Q4 results. ""I think you could see some caution around the Affordable Care Act as you go forward. We haven't really seen that much. But that could happen.""Trump said at a rally in Florida over the weekend that a replacement plan for ObamaCare won't be coming for ""a couple of weeks."" He warned earlier that the process could last until next year.Meanwhile, markets are still waiting for the White House to detail its own tax proposals, as those from congressional Republicans take more flak.Last week, Trump told retail CEOs that a ""massive"" tax plan will come ""in the not-too-distant future."" That followed his remarks to airline CEOs in the prior week, when he vowed to announce something ""phenomenal in terms of tax"" in the coming weeks.RELATED: If Border Tax Dies, Trump Corporate Tax Cut May CollapseTrump Silent On Ex-Im Bank, Hints At 'Big' Boeing Super Hornet Order

146,LLY,"Pfizer (PFE) stock regained earlier losses Tuesday after the No. 2 drugmaker reported Q4 earnings that lagged Wall Street expectations, with quarterly and full-year revenue guidance in line, outplaying its continued declines in sales of an adult pneumonia drug.In the stock market today, Pfizer stock fell as much as 1.2% to 30.93, but ended the day rising 1.3% to 31.73. Shares are down 2.3% for the year on worries Trump will go after drug pricing. Trump reportedly reiterated that view Tuesday in a meeting with pharma execs.For Q4, Pfizer reported $13.6 billion in sales, down 3% vs. the year-earlier period but meeting the consensus view. Pfizer reported 47 cents earnings per share ex items, down 11% and missing views for 50 cents.The company guided to $52 billion to $54 billion in 2017 sales, which was a bit light at the midpoint. And the midpoint of EPS minus items guidance of $2.50 to $2.60 was a penny short of the consensus view for $2.56.Pfizer wrapped up 2016 with $52.8 billion in sales and $2.4o EPS minus items, up 8% and 9%, respectively. Sales were in line, but EPS lagged the consensus by a penny. Sales of its Prevnar vaccines plunged 24% in Q4 and 8% for the year.Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez said higher-than-expected operating costs dragged down the bottom lines for both Pfizer and Eli Lilly (LLY), which also reported a largely in-line Q4 early Tuesday. Pfizer saw its SG&A costs increase in its Innovative Health unit.IBD'S TAKE: Pfizer might be ranked second in terms of market cap, behind Roche, but the stock underperforms 68% of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics with an IBD Composite Rating of just 32.

147,LLY,"CEOs of Dow stocks General Electric (GE), Boeing (BA) and 14 other big U.S. exporters are warning that unless Republicans embrace a controversial tax on imports, a once-in-a-generation chance at tax reform will fail and American workers would be the losers.""Our tax code penalizes American workers who make products or provide services sold abroad, while favoring their international competitors,"" the CEOs wrote in a letter to leaders of both parties in Congress.Among other companies whose CEOs co-signed the letter were Caterpillar (CAT), Dow Chemical (DOW), Raytheon (RTN), United Technologies (UTX), Oracle (ORCL) and some of the biggest drug and biotech companies: Celgene (CELG), Eli Lilly (LLY), Merck (MRK) and Pfizer (PFE).Caterpillar, Merck, Pfizer and United Technologies also are members of the Dow Jones industrial average, in addition to General Electric and Boeing.The letter puts some of the largest U.S. companies squarely behind House Speaker Paul Ryan and other House GOP leaders, who argue that leveling the international playing field by cutting the U.S. corporate tax rate to 20% (or lower) will be impossible without their plan for a 20% tax on imports, which would raise $1 trillion over a decade.Yet the biggest surprise about the letter may be just how few companies signed it, while more than 100 companies, including Wal-Mart (WMT), Target (TGT), Nike (NKE) and the American subsidiary of Toyota (TM), and dozens of trade groups have signed onto the Americans for Affordable Products, created to oppose the House border tax proposal. (Wal-Mart and Nike are also Dow industrials stocks.)Retail stocks were under pressure from early December, as prospects for a border tax were on the rise, but they've made a modest recovery lately as prospects faded. On Tuesday, perhaps helped more by Wal-Mart's positive earnings report as well-received Macy's (M) earnings than weighed down by a revved-up lobbying campaign for the tax, retail shares were on rise. Wal-Mart rose 3% to close at 71.45 on the stock market today, while Target added 0.6%.IBD'S TAKE: Supporters of the border tax plan say that the dollar would rise by 20% vs. other currencies, meaning that it wouldn't harm either corporate profits or consumers. But it does pose a risk to U.S. investors holding shares of companies like Alibaba or international ETFs.Under the House proposal for a border-adjusted tax, U.S. companies would pay a 20% tax rate on the full value of imported goods, while export revenue would be tax-free. The border tax would raise more than $1 trillion over a decade to offset the cost of lowering the 35% statutory tax rate to 20%, the conservative Tax Foundation has said.Without the border tax, the ability of Congress to reduce the U.S. corporate tax rate will be limited to ""incremental tweaks (that) will not level the playing field for American workers or dramatically reinvigorate economic growth,"" the CEO letter said.It's not clear precisely why so few companies came out in favor of the border tax. Although the proposal seems to be running into a buzz saw among Republicans in the Senate, it's possible that the letter wasn't widely circulated. However, Caroline Freund, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, has predicted that ""many more big lobbies will be against the BAT (border-adjusted tax) than in favor."" That's because the tax favors labor-intensive industries that export more than they import, with aerospace being a rare example.There's one nagging question about why companies such as GE and Boeing that are so dependent upon exports would back the border tax. Most trade experts who have looked at the tax have big doubts that it would comply with World Trade Organization rules, so it could lead the U.S. into a trade war. Given that uncertainty and the possible consequences, it's hard to understand why companies so dependent upon trade would support the border tax, yet that may partly explain why the list of supporters is so small.RELATED:If Border Tax Dies, Trump Corporate Tax Cut May Collapse GOP Border-Tax Plan Would Sock U.S. Tourism — Including Trump Hotels

148,LLY,"Biogen (BIIB) will trail Merck (MRK), AstraZeneca (AZN) and Eli Lilly (LLY) in launching a BACE inhibitor to treat Alzheimer's disease, a Leerink analyst said Thursday, the day Biogen's hemophilia unit, Bioverativ (BIVV), began trading independently.Biogen stock ended trading near 264 on the stock market today, but it was unclear whether that represented a drop or gain in price due to Bioverativ's listing. Upon that listing, Biogen formally distributed one share of Bioverativ for every two shares of Biogen to holders.Early Thursday, Bioverativ stock opened at 44.80 and it appeared Biogen shares dropped. Yee called the dive in Biogen stock an opportunity.""Some investors may have been waiting for after the spin to buy the stock and post the distribution as some don't want the Bioverativ issuance which is a company that has a very different profile and market cap than Biogen,"" he wrote in a research report.IBD'S TAKE: RBC was bullish on Amgen and Biogen, but remained cautious last month on shares of Gilead Sciences. Why? Grab IBD's Industry Themes for the full scoop.Others are counting on increasingly bullish views on Spinraza, Biogen's spinal muscular atrophy drug in conjunction with Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS). Assuming a strong launch, the Street should become comfortable with the new growth driver, he wrote.Alzheimer's, though, is more of a mixed bag.

149,LLY,"Shares of Biogen (BIIB) and Merck (MRK) were slammed early Wednesday after rival Eli Lilly (LLY) reported that its Alzheimer's drug darling, solanezumab, failed in a final-stage trial, though secondary signs indicate sola might not be totally dead in the water.Eli Lilly stock plunged as much as 18% to a more than two-year low but closed down 10.5% at 68 on the stock market today. Shares of Biogen and Merck, which are developing similar drugs, fell as much as 8.3% and 3.1%, respectively, but ended down 3.8% and 0.1%.Solanezumab, like Biogen's aducanumab, and Merck's verubecestat, targets plaque buildups in the brain associated with Alzheimer's. Eli Lilly's recent Expedition trial examined the effect of sola on patients with dementia due to Alzheimer's.But sola failed to show a statistically significant improvement in cognition decline vs. patients on the placebo, Eli Lilly said in a press release. Secondary endpoints ""directionally favored solanezumab, (but) the magnitudes of treatment differences were small.""IBD'S TAKE: Biotechs were pressuring the Nasdaq Wednesday, but medical software maker Veeva Systems, an IBD 50 stock, is flying high after its earnings report. For more on Veeva's growth prospects, check out this recent New America story.
"
150,LLY,"Eli Lilly will take on a $150 million charge, or 9 cents per share, in Q4 following the failed trial. The company said it plans to continue pursuing Alzheimer's research, but didn't say what that would mean for sola. Full results will be presented Dec. 8.""Lilly has strong growth prospects without solanezumab,"" David Ricks, Lilly's incoming chief executive officer and president of Lilly Bio-Medicines, said in a statement.Analysts had high hopes for solanezumab. In September, Goldman Sachs analyst Jami Rubi posited sola could ""supercharge"" Lilly's earnings and add $7.5 billion in peak sales.Rubin had a 35% probability of success for sola. Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan had a 60% chance of success on solanezumab. RBC analyst Michael Yee had suggested Biogen could spike on Eli Lilly's success.Wednesday, Yee kept his buy rating on Biogen stock, advising investors to buy on the dip. Biogen's drug includes a different antibody and different amyloid target than Eli Lilly's, he wrote in a research report. It also has shown statistically significant reduction of beta amyloid via imaging and benefits in cognition.Evercore analyst John Scotti noted in a research report that, in an apples-to-apples comparison, sola removes less plaque than Biogen's aducanumab. Sola also targets insoluble a-beta plaque, whereas aducanumab aims for soluble a-beta.RELATED:Eli Lilly's Alzheimer's Drug Fails Key Trial; Lilly, Biogen DiveLilly Poised For Big December On Alzheimer's Data, Diabetes RulingAmgen, Biogen, Eli Lilly Poised To Rocket On 'Most Important Event'

151,LLY,"The major stock indexes losses intensified Tuesday afternoon as the two-day Federal Reserve policy meeting got underway.The market was unfazed by a decent reading from the ISM manufacturing index as well as a round of healthy economic data out of China.The S&P 500 fell 0.6%, the Nasdaq composite 0.5% and the Dow Jones industrial average 0.4%. Small caps lagged, with the Russell 2000 down 0.9%. Volume on the YSE and Nasdaq was tracking slightly higher than Monday's levels.In the stock market today, Chevron (CVX) was the Dow's best gainer, rising 1.1%. The stock has been in rally mode after a big earnings beat Friday. The megacap oil play is edging closer to a potential breakout past a 107.68 entry in a flat base pattern.Pfizer (PFE) lagged in the Dow, falling 2%, on disappointing earnings. Pfizer also said it's ending development of a cholesterol-lowering drug projected to be a blockbuster. It also reduced its earnings outlook for the current quarter.IBD'S TAKE: Pfizer's weakness since August is partly due to concern about growing drug competition from Eli Lilly (LLY) and Novartis (NVS).In economic news, the Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing survey index ticked up to 51.9 in October from 51.5 the prior month, slightly ahead of expectations.Outside the U.S., economic data out of China looked pretty good. A manufacturing gauge for large, state-owned factories came in stronger than expected. The separate Caixin manufacturing gauge for midsized companies showed the best improvement in more than five years. A third gauge on services also rose.Martin Marietta (MLM) jumped nearly 5% despite an earnings miss before the open. It's working on the right side of a possible base.Fresh Del Monte Produce (FDP) gapped up on earnings, soaring nearly 7% to 64.40. After recently retracing a modest gain from a 60.95 buy point, Fresh Del Monte reclaimed the entry Tuesday.Shares of Alibaba (BABA) eased 1%.

152,LLY,"Eli Lilly (LLY) and AbbVie (ABBV) topped a Credit Suisse evaluation of pharmaceutical companies heading into 2017, leaving more challenged Pfizer (PFE), AstraZeneca (AZN) and Novo Nordisk (NVO) in the dust.But the PharmaValues 2017 list did little for IBD's 44-company Medical-Ethical Drugs industry group, which fell a fraction on the stock market today, a fifth consecutive down day. The group is down more than 20% this year, touched a three-month low Monday and is trading below its 50-day moving average.IBD'S TAKE: Biotech and pharmaceutical stocks have been trampled in the last month. With Q3 earnings reports coming up, can they climb the ""wall of worry?""Credit Suisse ranked 48 Big Pharma stocks on factors like enterprise value/net present value, pricing and replacement powers, and sales growth. Overall, Eli Lilly topped the list, with Europe-based Sanofi (SNY) and Novartis (NVS) trailing closely.AbbVie ranked highest on fundamentals, with investors likely assuming a long life span for Humira, Credit Suisse analysts wrote in a research report. Humira is the brand name for adalimumab, Abbvie's drug to treat arthritis, plaque psoriasis, ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.AbbVie stock, though, slipped a small fraction Monday, while Lilly stock fell nearly 1%.Meanwhile, Pfizer was ""weak across the board,"" AstraZeneca has a high EV/NPV (enterprise value to net present value) and Novo Nordisk is exposed to U.S. pricing pressure.For AstraZeneca, investors are potentially factoring in its oncology pipeline, Credit Suisse says, but ""recent results from others demonstrate significant risk.""Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA) scored well in EV/NPV valuation, with most of its sales power driven by its generic division. Gilead Sciences (GILD), Incyte (INCY) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) are all trading at a discount with Vertex only needing ""minimal further pipeline success to justify the current valuation,"" the report said.Among biotechs, Vertex topped Credit Suisse's list, with Amgen (AMGN) flailing at the bottom. Like pharmaceuticals, IBD's 421-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group, has been down this month. The group fell a fraction Monday and, like the ethical drugs group, also fell for a fifth straight trading day, and fell for the seventh day of the past eight trading days.Though near the bottom overall, AstraZeneca scored well in terms of pricing power with its shift toward oncology products. But Novo Nordisk is in ""the eye"" of the diabetes-rebate storm in the U.S., Credit Suisse said.Pricing power, Credit Suisse analysts note, is important as it helps ""companies to resist discount pressures from formulary managers and governments."" In that regard, Allergan (AGN) is the clear winner, with only Shire (SHPG) rivaling it in the dry-eye market.Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN), which focuses on rare diseases, is the most exceptional biotech, the analysts said, while Biomarin (BMRN), Incyte and Vertex also get high marks for being unique.Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and Eli Lilly beat out the cohort on R&D productivity and ability to drive the current pipeline.This follows the dramatic seesaw between Bristol-Myers Squibb and Merck (MRK) after Bristol-Myers' lung cancer drug, Opdivo, failed to meet a key endpoint. Eli Lilly scored well on its launches of Trulicity for diabetes and Taltz for psoriasis.

153,LLY,"IBD's 421-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group dropped 8% over the past three weeks, but RBC analyst Michael Yee expects stocks to rally, despite lackluster Q3 earnings, after the election season wraps.The sector still has nearly four weeks of ""choppiness"" before the Nov. 8 election, and recent blowouts have had some investors taking profits. But Yee suggested in a recent video to buy on the dip, as biotechs climb the ""wall of worry.""""Because of Q3 earnings not being hugely great for biotechs, and a combination of uncertainty in the election, I understand we could trade choppy in the (SPDR S&P Biotech ETF (XBI)) until we get some clarity on the election,"" he said.IBD'S TAKE: Biotechs were the worst-performing group Wednesday, and IBD tracks 197 groups. But last month, biotechs were on a major roll. Keep tabs on the Industry Theme for which sectors should grab your attention.Like, the 421-company group, shares of the SPDR Biotech ETF have plunged dramatically this month, down 10% over the past three weeks. On Thursday, shares were flat at 61.32, 6% from an entry point at 65.05 out of a flat base.Of the biggest biotech players, Yee is most confident on Amgen (AMGN) and Biogen (BIIB), respectively, Nos. 1 and 4 in market cap. In the stock market today, Amgen and Biogen both rose a fraction, to 164.29 and 294.41, respectively.The consensus of 23 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expects Amgen to report $5.73 billion in sales and $2.80 earnings per share ex items, flat and up 3%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier quarter. Analysts model Biogen reporting $2.9 billion in sales, up 5%, and $4.97 EPS ex items, up 11%.Biogen is a stock to own over the next three to six months, Yee says. There's a 30% chance Biogen will get taken over, as it still lacks a CEO after the company announced in July, amid M&A rumors, that George Scangos would step down. Yee also sees a 30%-40% chance Eli Lilly's (LLY) Alzheimer's drug trial could yield positive results, which could tug rival Biogen up 20%.Other catalysts include Biogen's partnership with Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS) for drugs to treat type 1 muscular dystrophy and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). Ionis is enrolling infants and children in Phase 3 trials for SMA. Wall Street underappreciates those catalysts, Yee says.Celgene (CELG), too, has a number of trials that could stoke the stock, Yee says. For Q3, analysts model a 22% jump in sales to $2.84 billion and $1.48 EPS ex items, up 20%. Celgene share are down 8.5% since Sept. 23, rising a small fraction Thursday, to 100.63.Yee only expects an in-line quarter. Early next year, Celgene is expected to release the results of trials for drugs to treat muscular dystrophy, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis — which are likely stock catalysts.Gilead (GILD), the No. 2 biotech by market cap, is in for a rough quarter on shadowy visibility for its hepatitis C drug, Yee says. The drug, Epclusa, won FDA approval in June and can be used in pill form to treat six types of hep C. But lacking greater visibility, Gilead stock is range-bound, Yee says.Consensus expectations are too high for hep C sales and EPS in 2016, he wrote in a research report. For 2016, the consensus of 26 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters models $11.79 EPS ex items. Yee's estimate is $10.Broadly, analysts are bearish on Gilead's Q3, forecasting a 9% sales dip to $7.53 billion and EPS minus items down 10%, to $2.89. Shares are down 10% over the past three weeks, ending Thursday near flat, at 73.06.Smaller Intercept Pharmaceuticals (ICPT) (with a $3.55 billion market cap) will likely print an across-the-board beat for Q3, Yee predicts. But shares have been pressured recently by Gilead, Novartis (NVS) and Allergan (AGN) which are jumping on the NASH (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis) train.NASH drugs have made big headlines over the past month with Allergan buying Tobira Therapeutics (TBRA) to bulk-up in the NASH battle. But, says Yee, Intercept's drug, which belongs to a class called FXR agonists, is more potent.""Intercept's drug gets into the liver an activates FXR (farnesoid X receptors) in the liver,"" he said. ""The others don't get as much FXR effectivity in the liver; they just do it in the gut. It's not as potent as Intercept.""Yee also calls Prothena (PRTA) one to own on likely positive Parkinson's drug and psoriasis drug data in Q4 and the spring, respectively. Prothena stock was in a sell zone Thursday, 16% below a 65.05 entry point achieved Sept. 19, after rising nearly 1% Thursday to 54.85.RELATED:What Will Gilead Try Buying Next?

154,LLY,"Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) stock crashed to a two-year low Monday after competitor Merck (MRK) unveiled Phase 3 results showing lung-cancer drug Keytruda is twice as effective as chemotherapy, sparking its stock to a breakout.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Bristol-Myers Squibb stock plunged 10.1% to end trading at 49.81.Merck stock, on the other hand, lifted as much as 3.3% to a 15-year high near 65, and ended Monday trading up 1.8% to 63.90. Shares briefly hit a 64.10 entry point out of a flat base, adding to a 19% gain since January. New buys, though, are risky in the current volatile market environment.IBD'S TAKE: Merck stock is in a buy zone, but it's far from alone. Check out IBD's Stocks Near Buy Zone to find out which players are recommended bets.Shares ramped on Merck's presentation at the 2016 European Society of Medical Oncology conference in Copenhagen. There, Merck unveiled the results of Phase 3 testing for Keytruda, a drug to treat non-small cell lung cancer.Keytruda, alone, extended progression-free survival to 10.3 months vs. six months with chemotherapy for lung cancer patients expressing a specific type of protein, Merck said.Merck also combined Keytruda with Eli Lilly's (LLY) chemo drug Alimta. In that study, 55% of patients responded to the combination vs. 29% of patients receiving chemo. Median progression-free survival was 4.1 months longer on the combo.Bristol-Myers Squibb's nivolumab, a rival treatment for lung cancer, showed ""virtually no benefit,"" Evercore ISI analyst John Scotti wrote in a research report. That ""left investors scratching their heads,"" he said.Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan expects Merck to take a major leadership position in the lung-tumor market vs. Bristol-Myers, AstraZeneca (AZN) and Roche (RHHBY). Though, he says, Roche might pile on some pressure with its Tecentriq.Tecentriq has shown an overall survival benefit in second-line lung cancer regardless protein expression, he wrote. He estimates $3 billion in peak sales with a 60% probability of success.RBC analyst Michael Yee expects Celgene (CELG) to fly on the potential for chemo-combos like the one Merck tested with Keytruda. He sees Celgene growing its revenue if only 30% of the first-line lung cancer patients are treated with chemo-combos.In other news from the conference, Credit Suisse's Divan expects Novartis (NVS) to face some pressure post-ESMO. Novartis' drug to combat metastatic breast cancer is as effective as Pfizer's (PFE) Ibrance, but has some serious safety concerns.""While efficacy appears in line with Ibrance, safety observations of Hy's law (risk of fatal drug-induced liver injury) and QTc prolongation (mild cardiac arrhythmia) may put the drug at a disadvantage to Pfizer's Ibrance or Eli Lilly's Abemaciclib, which may be approved in 2017,"" he wrote.Novartis stock lost 0.7% to end Monday trades at 77.75.Bristol-Myers, Eli Lilly, AstraZeneca, Roche, Pfizer, Novartis and Merck are in IBD's ethical drugs industry group.

156,LLY,"Roche (RHHBY) CEO Severin Schwan shrugged off President Trump's crackdown on drug prices Wednesday, saying the Swiss drugmaker expects to reap the benefits of ""literally billions"" invested in the market.""We focus on truly differentiated medicines — medicines which make a real difference for patients,"" he said, according to CNBC. ""I have no doubt whatsoever that there will be continued demand for such solutions, and particularly the U.S., I'm convinced, will reward this kind of innovation.""The U.S. market is important to Roche. In 2016, nearly half of Roche's pharmaceutical sales — 47% — stemmed from the U.S., and 26% of its diagnostics tools were sold in North America. But on Tuesday, Trump reaffirmed his pledge to go after rising drug prices.""We have to get lower prices,"" he told a slew of pharma bigwigs, including the CEOs of Celgene (CELG), Eli Lilly (LLY), Merck (MRK) and Novartis (NVS). A Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) executive also was reportedly in attendance. There, President Trump promised to deregulate the drug industry and cut taxes.Trump also abandoned his proposal to revisit the idea of allowing the federal government to negotiate drug prices on behalf of Medicare and Medicaid, which cover millions of Americans and are among the largest purchasers of drugs and health care services in the world.IBD'S TAKE: Trump's commentary momentarily boosted drug stocks on Tuesday, but a day earlier the president's ban on immigration took a bite out of airline stocks. Read IBD's Industry Themes column for more on a safer entry point in the travel sector.Drug stocks rose 1.5% on Tuesday following reports of Trump's softened stance on Big Pharma. IBD's 43-company Ethical Drugs industry group edged up a small fraction on the stock market today. Roche stock rose 0.47% to 30.10, touching a nearly three-month high.Schwan's commentary came as Roche reported 5% growth in 2016 sales to $50.98 billion. The consensus of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected $51.57 billion. Core earnings per share rose 8%.Revenue from breast cancer and rheumatoid arthritis drugs helped outplay a dip in sales of drugs to treat hepatitis B and C, pancreatic and non-small-cell lung cancer, and wet age-related macular degeneration, an eye disease.The hep C sector has suffered recently, with sales dipping 6%-7% from the third to fourth quarters, according to market researcher IHS. Shares of Gilead Sciences (GILD) and J&J have been under pressure recently on their hep C units. J&J's hep C sales dipped to ""virtually nothing"" in the fourth quarter.Swiss Roche saw a similarly painful decline. Sales of hep C drug Lucentis, which is only sold in the U.S., fell 10% in 2016 to $1.42 million. Offsetting that, sales of breast cancer drug Perjeta and rheumatoid arthritis drug Actemra rose 26% and 16%, respectively.Roche also listed seven new launches, including oncology drug Tecentriq. Tecentriq is approved for previously treated non-small-cell lung cancer and previously treated advanced cancer of the urinary tract. It competes against Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and Merck in the non-small-cell lung cancer sector.RELATED:Gilead Clobbered On Hep C; 'Little Value' In 'Too Late' NASH, HIV UnitsRoche Gouges Bristol-Myers' Q4 Lung Cancer Share Amid Merck RivalryWill Merck Let Incyte Go After AstraZeneca, Bristol, Roche Team-Ups Too?

158,LLY,"The FDA's track record for oncology ""hits"" under its accelerated approval program bodes well for Merck (MRK)'s Keytruda-plus-chemo combo, Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez said Tuesday, suggesting administrators have access to early data.Merck's Keytruda, an immunotherapy, in combination with Eli Lilly's (LLY) Alimta chemotherapy is being tested as a first-line treatment in non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who have a high expression of the PDL1 gene.Last week, the FDA granted the combo priority review under a supplemental Biologics License Agreement (BLA) based on a small cohort. Fernandez says the surprise move would be better explained if the FDA had access to ongoing phase three data and, thus, better visibility on efficacy.""While this view may be controversial, an interview with Richard Pazdur, M.D., acting director of the FDA's Oncology Center of Excellence, in 'The Cancer Letter' suggests the agency has access to clinical trial data without the risk of unbinding the study,"" Fernandez wrote in a research report.IBD'S TAKE: Drug stocks momentarily tanked last week when President-elect Donald Trump again pledged to curb rising drug prices. Will he make good on his promise? And what could it mean for your drug and biotech picks? Read on in IBD's Industry Themes for a deeper dive.Of 19 accelerated approvals over the last two years, 12 have already had positive confirmatory phase three data and five have received full approvals, Fernandez says. Only five of those approvals took more than six month to review.In Merck's case, data from the Keytruda-plus-Alimta combo are due in September. If approved, the combo could open Merck up to about 70% of the patient population. The currently approved indication is only for patients who have a high expression (50% plus) of the PDL1 gene — about 25%-30% of patients.But the drugmaker is facing rivals. Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) is testing a combination of Opdivo and Yervoy, both immunotherapies. Analysts have suggested combining immunotherapies could be more potent than adding chemo to an immunotherapy (Merck's approach).AstraZeneca (AZN), too, is creeping up on Merck. On Tuesday, AstraZeneca outlined its strategy for trials to test durvalumab as a monotherapy and in combination with tremelimumab. Both are immunotherapies. Durvalumab targets the PDL1 gene. Tremelimumab aims for the CTLA-4 gene.In its ""Mystic"" trial, AstraZeneca will examine progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) for high-expressing PDL1 patients. Both PFS and OS will be examined for all-comers regardless PDL1 status in the combo arm.Its ""Neptune"" trial will be expanded to patients in China and be used for regulatory filing in the country, Fernandez says. Neptune will test the combo durvalumab and tremelimumab. Another trial recruiting in Asia, ""Pearl,"" will test durvalumab as a first-line treatment vs. chemotherapy.Some data are expected in 2018, meaning Merck still has a nine- to 16-month head start, Fernandez says.In the stock market today, Merck stock fell 1.4% to 61.48, while Lilly stock slipped 0.71% to 76.85. Shares of AstraZeneca fell 0.38% to 28.47, while Bristol-Myers Squibb edged up 6 cents to 56.28.RELATED:Merck Carries Incyte On Keytruda Coattails In 4 'Hot' Tumors: LeerinkEli Lilly Rebounds On Chemo-Drug Patent Win Vs.

159,LLY,"After rising for three consecutive years, the FDA's drug approval rate in 2016 plunged to a nine-year low despite Biogen (BIIB), Merck (MRK) and Eli Lilly (LLY) each adding two new drugs to their bailiwicks, according to Swiss biotech HBM Partners.The Food and Drug Administration approved 19 new molecular entities in 2016, down 51% from 45 in 2015 — a year that marked a decade-high for approvals NMEs, says HBM. There had not been fewer NMEs approved since 2007, when the FDA gave its blessing to just 17.About half those NMEs in 2016 (nine), were not fully developed in house. Five were acquired via M&A and four were in-licensed, HBM wrote.Of the 19 new drugs, nine (47%) were for ""first-in-class"" drugs. By therapeutic area, cancer led among NMEs. Four new drugs in 2016 — projected at an industry-leading $7.5 billion in peak sales — were in oncology, HBM found.IBD'S TAKE: Easing the FDA approval process could be part of Donald Trump's health care initiatives, but will the president-elect really break with Republicans to enact major drug reform?That's a trend. Over the past five years, oncology drugs saw a major increase on the FDA approval list. From 2012-16, 50 new cancer drugs were approved, rising from 24 NMEs in cancer from 2007-11.From 2012-16, the FDA had an increased appetite for drugs to treat diabetes, respiratory diseases, viral and other infections. Its interest in cardiovascular, genetic and immunology drugs increased moderately. But those years also saw fewer central nervous system drugs.Since then, Merck and Roche (RHHBY) have had more drugs approved than any other companies. Each added eight.Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Pfizer (PFE) follow closely with seven apiece.Gilead Sciences (GILD), Novartis (NVS), GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), Sanofi (SNY) and Lilly have each added six new drugs.IBD's 420-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group closed down 1% on the stock market today.

161,LLY,"Eli Lilly (LLY) will regain a late-stage migraine drug with its $960 million plan to acquire small-cap biotech CoLucid Pharmaceuticals (CLCD). The announcement sent CoLucid stock to a record high early Wednesday.The $960 million deal values CoLucid at $46.50 per share. It's expected to close by the end of Q1.CoLucid stock rocketed 32.5% to close at 46.25 on the stock market today. Eli Lilly stock rose 0.9% to finish at 77.53. CoLucid made its IPO in mid-2015 at 10, and closed 2016 at 36.40.Acquiring CoLucid lets Lilly get its hands on lasmiditan, a 5-HT1F agonist in phase 3 testing to treat acute migraine.Lilly originally developed lasmiditan, but licensed the drug to CoLucid in 2005, since pain management then wasn't a strategic focus for Lilly. Since then, Lilly has refocused on pain meds and, in its emerging markets pipeline, is focusing on cancer, osteoarthritis, back and migraine pain.IBD'S TAKE: Donald Trump sent pharma-tied stocks into a tailspin last week after accusing drugmakers of ""getting away with murder"" by spiking drug prices. Get the deep dive on IBD's Industry Themes.An estimated 36 million people in the U.S. suffer migraines, Lilly says. Lilly, Alder Pharmaceuticals (ALDR), Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA) and Amgen (AMGN) are neck-and-neck in the anti-CGRP migraine market.They'll all likely be coming to market within months of each other in 2018, Alder CEO Randall Schatzman told IBD earlier this month during the annual JPMorgan Healthcare Conference.But he says the market is large enough for all four competitors.Under the terms of Eli Lilly's deal to acquire CoLucid, Lilly will incur an $850 million charge, about 80 cents per share. The charge will likely reduce earnings expectations by that amount in Q1.

162,LLY,"Eli Lilly (LLY) aims to take another bite out of the animal-health market, buying a unit of Germany's Boehringer Ingelheim, which itself is acquiring Sanofi's (SNY) animal-health business.Zoetis (ZTS), spun out of Pfizer (PFE) in 2013, is the No. 1 animal-health company, but Boehringer likely will become No. 2, Evercore ISI analyst John Scotti said in an email to clients Wednesday, and Lilly's Elanco unit will get bigger.Lilly stock rose a fraction in the stock market today, while Zoetis stock fell a fraction, to 52.18. Zoetis stock has been forming a flat base, with a possible buy point of 52.71.Lilly agreed to pay $885 million for Boehringer's Vermedica unit, which includes common vaccines for dogs, cats and other animals, as well as an Iowa manufacturing site. These include common vaccines for bordetella, parvovirus and rabies. Zoetis sells rabies, and other, vaccines for cats and dogs.Scotti said he spoke with Lilly representatives, who said the Boehringer vaccine portfolio, with the deal expected to close early next year, would generate about $200 million in annual revenue, about 5% of Elanco's total sales. Elanco accounted for 16% of Lilly's 2015 revenue. Lilly bought the animal-health division of Novartis (NVS) in early 2015.Scotti said Lilly indicated it will maintain its operating profit margin target of high 20s-30% by 2020, up from about 19% last year. He says Zoetis has targeted about 34% for its operating margin by 2020, where it's currently above 30%.""Coupled with our robust food animal portfolio, this addition further strengthens Elanco's position in the global animal health business,"" Lilly CEO John Lechleiter said in the company's press release.Boehringer said in June it would sell the Vermedica unit, as antitrust regulators reviewed its acquisition of Sanofi's animal-health business.IBD'S TAKE: Lilly and Zoetis are in IBD's 44-company Medical-Ethical Drugs group, which ranks just No. 137 out of 197 groups tracked. Still, within the group, Zoetis ties Depomed with the highest Composite Rating, at 83. CR is a broad measure of performance, looking at key metrics such as earnings and sales growth.

163,LLY,"Biotech Prothena (PRTA) said late Thursday that it plans to launch phase two testing for a psoriatic arthritis drug that has similar science to psoriasis drugs already tested by drugmakers Amgen (AMGN), Eli Lilly (LLY) and Novartis (NVS).Psoriatic arthritis is a common form of arthritis that affects patients with psoriasis, a skin disorder in which white skin cells build up, causing itchy, dry patches. Credit Suisse analyst Kennen MacKay estimates the psoriatic arthritis market at $4 billion by 2020.But that market also comes with high competitive barriers, he wrote in a research report.""While psoriatic arthritis is a large market with forecasted biologic sales cresting at $4 billion by 2022, we see multiple entrenched biologic brands providing a significant competitive barrier to entry,"" he wrote. And Remicade's entrance to the market could further complicate matters.Despite this, MacKay sees Prothena's psoriatic arthritis drug, PRX-003, as having a ""novel mechanism"" that could go beyond inhibiting TH17 cells and IL-17 cytokines, which is the science behind psoriasis drugs from Amgen, Eli Lilly and Novartis.Their compounds knock out TH-17, a type of pro-inflammatory cells tied to autoimmune diseases like multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis, MacKay wrote. Doing so, also knocks out the IL-17 cytokine, which is associated with psoriasis.But to combat psoriatic arthritis, Prothena's compound will have to account for TH17 cells, IL-17 cytokines and other types of cytokines, RBC analyst Michael Yee wrote in a report. Phase two testing is slated to begin in 2017, trailing phase three psoriasis-drug testing from the other three.Yee and MacKay separately kept their outperform ratings on Prothena stock. At the close on the stock market today, Prothena stock was up 3.2% to 59.97. Shares were in a buy zone for the 10th consecutive day after hitting an entry point at 60.09 out of a flat base on Aug. 19, though in this volatile market investors should be cautious with new buys.IBD'S TAKE: Prothena's rise on Wall Street today outplayed a broader downtrend that saw the Nasdaq and S&P 500 drop.

164,LLY,"No. 1 drugmaker by market cap Amgen (AMGN) will likely beat Eli Lilly (LLY), Alder Biopharmaceuticals (ALDR) and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA) to market with an protein-blocking migraine med that, some say, could be a game-changer for the industry.Late Wednesday, Amgen said its migraine drug, AMG-334, cut episodic migraines by 2.9 days per month vs. a 1.8-day reduction for patients treated with the placebo. The Phase 3 trial centered on 557 patients who experience four to 14 migraine days each month.The AMG-334 drug is erenumab, which is designed to block the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor that is believed to be intricately tied to migraines. CGRP is a protein involved in the transmission of pain.The drug was administered at 70 milligrams monthly for 12 weeks and had a safety profile similar to that of the placebo. A second Phase 3 study is ongoing, examining 70-mg and 140-mg doses for 24 weeks. Amgen said it expects to have the results of that study by year's end.""People with episodic migraines lose a substantial portion of their lives to migraines, and many face intolerable pain and physical impairment, frequently accompanied by a significant disruption of their daily activities,"" Dr. Sean Harper, executive vice president of R&D at Amgen, said in a statement.The Migraine Research Foundation estimates U.S. employers lose $13 billion annually as a result of 113 million workdays lost to migraines. Episodic migraines are defined as less than 15 headache days per month and comprise roughly 90% of diagnosed patients, said RBC analyst Michael Yee.""These positive results, along with the recent chronic migraine results, contribute to the growing body of evidence supporting erenumab as an innovative treatment option for people who are suffering from this debilitating disease,"" Harper said.But Wall Street is more bearish on CGRP-blocking drugs, Yee wrote in a research report. Besides Amgen — which partnered with Novartis (NVS) on erenumab — Eli Lilly, Teva and Alder are developing similar drugs. Investors are expecting a price war, Yee said.""However, our general view is payors will pay for these drugs given a reasonably low price but also because migraine is a serious issue impacting millions of patients with economic burden and patient quality of life issues,"" he wrote.Yee sees a $1 billion franchise for Amgen's AMG-334. He has an outperform rating on Amgen stock, which fell 2.1%, to 166.21, on the stock market today.Shares are in a buy zone, less than 1% extended from a 164.80 entry point out of a cup-with-handle formation achieved July 22. In this volatile market, though, it's best to be cautious about any new buys.Amgen stock touched a 13-month high of 176.85 on Friday.IBD'S TAKE: Amgen is the No. 1 drugmaker by market cap, but its IBD Composite Rating of 96 puts it as No. 7 out of 421 companies in IBD's Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group. Biospecifics Technologies leads the group with a CR of 99, meaning it performs in the top 1% of all stocks. Get the Stock Checkup.RELATED:Amgen's Multiple Myeloma Drug Bumbles Key Test Vs.

165,LLY,"Prothena's (PRTA) 10% stock nose-dive since Friday amid political volatility is a buying opportunity, says RBC analyst Michael Yee, who sees the biotech landing a partnership with the likes of Eli Lilly (LLY) or Pfizer (PFE) on its psoriasis drug.Investors, though, haven't been that bullish on Prothena stock or any of its rivals. On Wednesday, IBD's 421-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group was the worst performing out of 197 groups tracked. Shares plunged 3.1%, dipping below the 50-day moving average.IBD'S TAKE: The 421-company group is ranked No. 8 out of 197 groups tracked, rising from No. 126 just 13 weeks ago. But shares were raked over the coals Wednesday as Prothena and Supernus toppled markedly. Check out IBD's Industry Themes to get an idea of better stock bets.Yee chalks the weak drug stocks of late to political angst. He has an outperform rating and 95 price target on Prothena stock. Prothena shares closed up 0.9% on the stock market today to 54.85, but intraday had fallen more than 9% below an entry point at 60.09 touched on Sept. 19, out of a consolidation. Investors are advised to sell if a stock falls 7% or 8% from a buy point.""The key take-away is the recent 10% pullback, which we think is mostly all due to political uncertainties (House/Senate race), is an opportunity in our view because the company is on track with a very busy and full pipeline,"" he wrote in a research report Thursday.Prothena has three key drugs on the line. It is currently enrolling patients in Phase 2b and Phase 3 trials for NEOD001, a drug to treat amyloidosis. Amyloidosis occurs when a normally soluble protein mis-folds and accumulates, becoming toxic to organs.Yee has 70% confidence in NEOD001's chances and sees ""100% potential upside"" toward a 125 price target if the Phase 2B Pronto trial shows positive data in 2017. And Prothena's PRX002 and PRX003 are underappreciated by the Wall Street consensus, Yee says.He expects the duo to provide additional upside opportunities in 2017-2019. PRX002 aims to treat Parkinson's in partnership with Roche (RHHBY), and PRX003 is Prothena's drug for psoriasis. The latter is key considering Big Pharma's interest in inflammation drugs, evidenced by a number of Allergan (AGN) deals.""Pharma is interested in this including Pfizer and Eli Lilly,"" he wrote. ""We think Prothena could land a nice partnership on this asset after Phase II data in summer.""The design could also be novel, he says. Prothena's PRX003 is building on the science of inhibiting TH-17 cells and IL-17s cytokines, which are tied to inflammatory diseases. The method is used by Amgen (AMGN), Eli Lilly and Novartis (NVS) in their psoriasis drugs.RELATED:Allergan Challenges Intercept With NASH DrugEli Lilly Looks To Coral More Animal-Health Business From Zoetis

166,LLY,"Biotech Gilead (GILD) is most likely to scoop up Incyte (INCY) over the next 12 months, according to a survey of 244 industry watchers by Evercore ISI investment bank, ahead of the presidential election pitting Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.Of those surveyed, 16% say they'd most like to see Gilead purchase Incyte, and 14% identified Incyte as the biopharma most likely to be acquired over the next year. Nearly 12% and 10%, respectively, see Biogen (BIIB) and BioMarin Pharmaceutical (BMRN) as targets.Gilead, Acadia Pharmaceuticals (ACAD), Celgene (CELG) and Kite Pharma (KITE) are least likely to be targeted, with only 2% of industry experts identifying each as a likely takeover candidate. That's a departure from Needham's analysis last week identifying 11 potential suitors for Acadia.An Incyte takeover would likely come at a heavy price. As of June 30, Gilead had $24.6 billion in cash, equivalents and market securities on hand. By market cap, Gilead is the No. 2 biotech, trailing only Amgen, but it's widely viewed as among the big biotechs that most needs to be active on the M&A front. Incyte has a $17 billion market capitulation. Smaller coalitions, 10% and 8%, say Gilead could buy Vertex (VRTX) or Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY).Outside M&A, the lion's share of experts (52%) expect biotechs to outperform the broader markets over the next six months, whereas 54% of respondents say biopharmas will merely be in line. Both will trade up after the election, say 65% of experts.But IBD's 241-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group is down 16% this year, but those losses were early in the year, when the overall market tumbled. The group is up more than 25% since late June and now ranks No. 6 out of 197 groups tracked, up from No. 160 just 13 weeks ago.At the close on the stock market today, the group was up more than 1.4%, bucking a two-day downtrend.IBD'S TAKE: The latest Industry Snapshot explores biotech M&A and promising new drugs, and which stocks are leading the biotech sector.Drug pricing initiatives could rout stocks this year, an RBC analyst said Thursday. Though he acknowledged drugmakers like Amgen (AMGN), Gilead, Celgene, Biogen, Regeneron (REGN) and Vertex could easily find loopholes to skirt new regulations.Still, fewer than 1% of the people polled by Evercore expect the government to take meaningful action on drug pricing in 2016. Nearly 44% (the largest chunk) say the government won't ever push for a reduction in drug prices.Other predictions stem around specific companies. Only 14% expect Eli Lilly's (LLY) Alzheimer's drug, Solanezumab, to hit cognition and function endpoints. More broadly, 42% say it will hit cognition but miss on function.More than half (51%) say Celgene's Phase 3 testing for GED-0301, an oral mongersen treatment for Crohn's, will fail to reach the overwhelming efficacy seen in Phase 2 testing. During Phase 2, 67% of patients taking 160 milligrams were in clinical remission on day 15.A small 7% say Celgene will see better results in Phase 3 testing. Only 3% expect the study to fail entirely. If the results show endoscopic improvement, 64% of respondents say Celgene stock will pop. A third expect shares to remain stagnant.RELATED:Gilead 'Paralyzed' On Likely Hep C Share LossAmgen, Biogen, Gilead Could Spike VA Pricing To Skirt California MeasureRegeneron Pharmaceuticals Falls As Combo Therapy Worse Than Eylea Alone

167,LLY,"Shares of Big Pharmas Eli Lilly (LLY) and AbbVie (ABBV) were moving in opposite directions Thursday after JPMorgan upgraded one and downgraded the other.Analyst Chris Schott wrote that the risk/reward ratio is looking favorable going into the release of late-stage trial results on Lilly's Alzheimer's disease drug solanezumab, expected in December. He pointed out that Lilly has a deep pipeline of Alzheimer's drugs beyond solanezumab, as well as new drugs in other disease areas.""We see a range of new product opportunities at Lilly that should support the company's growth targets, and are forecasting 6% top-line growth through 2020 (5% excluding risk-adjusted solanezumab sales) supported by a number of $1+ billion product opportunities such as Trulicity, Jardiance, Taltz, baricitinib and abemaciclib,"" Schott wrote in a research note upgrading Lilly stock to overweight from neutral. ""In aggregate, we forecast recent/upcoming new product launches to generate $11.4 billion in sales by 2020.""Lilly stock was up about 1.5% in late-afternoon trading on the stock market today, near 80.IBD'S TAKE: Despite JPMorgan's actions, AbbVie is rated No. 1 in IBD's Medical-ethical drugs group, while Lilly is No. 16. To see why, read about the CAN SLIM Investing System.Meanwhile, Schott downgraded AbbVie to neutral from overweight, saying that he still likes its long-term prospects but there aren't enough near-term catalysts to offset the erosion of its lead drug Humira in the face of biosimilar competition.""While it is possible Humira could see no or limited biosimilar competition through 2021/2022, we expect little clarity on potential outcomes over the next 12-18 months,"" Schott wrote.AbbVie stock was down about 1.5% in late-afternoon trading Thursday, near 64.RELATED:Lilly Breast Cancer Drug Study Rolls On

168,LLY,"Small biotech Lexicon Pharmaceuticals (LXRX) soared as much as 25% Friday after its diabetes drug succeeded in a late-stage trial.Lexicon's drug sotagliflozin significantly reduced A1C, a type of hemoglobin used to measure glucose levels in plasma, in patients with Type 1 diabetes.Sotagliflozin is a combination of an SGLT2 inhibitor similar to Eli Lilly's (LLY) Jardiance and Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) Invokana, with an SGLT1 inhibitor that helps regulate glucose absorption in the gastrointestinal tract.The study did not see an increase in severe hypoglycemia, though there was a dose-related increase in diabetic ketoacidosis, reaching 3% in the higher-dose arm.IBD'S TAKE: Lexicon hit a new 52-week high, and it's always a good idea to check IBD's New Highs list. But hitting a new high isn't the be-all and end-all for a good stock, as our New Highs page explains.The Type 1 diabetes market is a fraction of the size of the Type 2 market, but Lexicon said it will start phase three trials in Type 2 this year in collaboration with French pharma Sanofi (SNY).""We think its dual mechanism of action as an SGLT-1/SGLT-2 inhibitor could differentiate it from marketed SGLT-2 inhibitors in Type 2 diabetes, and we assume peak sales could exceed $2 billion in this indication,"" wrote Morningstar analyst Karen Andersen in a research note last November. ""While Lexicon will now see smaller realized sales in Type 1 diabetes, in the form of double-digit royalties from Sanofi, this deal also opens up significant potential in Type 2 diabetes.""Lexicon stocked ended up 17% on the stock market today, at 17.85, a nearly three-year high. Sanofi stock, though, fell 2.2%, to 39.19.RELATED:Sanofi Rival To Mylan's EpiPen Had TroublesEli Lilly Upgraded On Pipeline Prospects

169,LLY,"Medical behemoths Amgen (AMGN) and Biogen (BIIB) could square off to acquire muscle biologist Cytokinetics (CYTK), while more than a dozen potential players prep for an M&A donnybrook over small-cap Adamas Pharmaceuticals (ADMS), Needham analysts suggested Friday.Biotech M&A fodder heated up this week as Allergan (AGN) announced back-to-back deals to acquire Vitae Pharmaceuticals (VTAE) for $639 million and Tobira Therapeutics (TBRA) for $1.7 billion. The Tobira deal gives Allergan a leg up in the battle against nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), where Gilead (GILD) and Intercept (ICPT) Pharmaceuticals also compete.IBD's 420-company biotech industry group has climbed to No. 10 out of 197 groups tracked from No. 173 just 13 weeks ago. Collectively, the group has a $771 billion market cap, No. 11 among all groups. The group fell 0.7% Friday, its first decline in the past eight trading days. The group was up 3.8% for the week.Needham analysts reviewed R&D pipelines, business development areas of interest and M&A activity for 26 large companies to gauge how interested Big Pharma is in biotechs -- ""an important theme in the biotech space,"" they wrote in a research report.Since 2012, Allergan, Amgen, Bristol Myers-Squibb (BMY), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Merck (MRK), Pfizer (PFE), Roche (RHHBY), Shire (SHPG) and Valeant (VRX) have been most acquisitive, buying (or prepping to buy) more than 100 companies, collectively. Shire has been most active, with 14 acquisitions.""We believe late-development-stage and commercial-stage biotech companies are particularly attractive acquisition targets,"" they wrote in a research report titled, ""What does Big Pharma want to buy?"" Peak areas of interest include oncology and cardiovascular, Needham research showed.But that may not be where Big Pharma takes its beaucoup bucks for M&A. Needham analysts suggested central nervous system (CNS) players Adamas and Acadia Pharmaceuticals, and liver disorder drugmaker Intercept could be of prime acquisition interest.Eight firms overlap in potential interest for Adamas and Acadia: AbbVie (ABBV), Allergan, Eli Lilly (LLY), Lundbeck, Merck, Novartis Pharmaceuticals (NVS), Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA) and Takeda Pharmaceutical.Needham lists 13 potential acquirers for Adamas, but Allergan makes particular sense considering the duo already partner on the next-generation formulation of memantine and the fixed-dose combination product Namzaric, both of which battle Alzheimer's.By year's end, Adamas plans to file a new drug application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for ADS-5102, a treatment for levodopa-induced dyskinesia -- involuntary movements -- in Parkinson's disease patients and multiple sclerosis walking impairments, Needham wrote.Meanwhile, Acadia's 11 potential suitors could be interested in Nuplazid, a drug to ease psychosis associated with Parkinson's launched earlier this year. Needham suggests Acadia could be looking to expand the label for other uses.Similarly, Intercept could draw interest from nearly a dozen potential buyers including Gilead, No. 2 biotech by market cap. On Thursday, an RBC analyst posited Intercept would continue to lead Gilead and Allergan in the battle against NASH.IBD'S TAKE: Biotech stocks notched higher this week, up about 4% since last week.

170,LLY,"Big pharma Eli Lilly (LLY) fell Wednesday when its breast cancer drug didn't prove to be the knockout that investors had hoped for.An outside committee conducted an interim analysis of Monarch-2, a late-stage trial of Lilly's drug abemaciclib combined with fulvestrant (AstraZeneca's (AZN) Faslodex) in advanced or metastatic breast cancer. If the drug was showing enough efficacy already, then the trial would have been stopped early, and Lilly could have gone ahead and filed for FDA approval. But the committee recommended that the study continue to its previously planned completion point.""We had stringent criteria set for this interim analysis, and we look forward to receiving the final Monarch-2 results in the first half of 2017,"" Richard Gaynor, Lilly's vice president of product development and medical affairs, said in a statement.Lilly stock fell 1.2% to 80.55 on the stock market today after falling as low as 79.67 intraday.Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez said this follows ambiguous results from a previous study of abemaciclib as a monotherapy, i.e. without fulvestrant.""While the single-agent response rate seemed to be better than that of the competition -- Pfizer's (PFE) palbociclib (Ibrance) and Novartis' (NVS) ribociclib -- it did not meet its primary endpoint,"" Fernandez wrote in a research note. ""Management indicated that it would file for approval after the Monarch-2 interim analysis.""At this point, we believe it is unlikely that it will be able to file for monotherapy in 3Q.""Fernandez added that both Pfizer and Novartis stopped their trials early for efficacy, so Lilly was widely expected to do so as well. All three of the drugs are in the same class, called cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitors. Pfizer's Ibrance, approved in February 2015, has already passed $1.6 billion in sales.IBD'S TAKE: The timing of drug launches is important to drug stocks' future financial estimates, which are preferably going up. Lilly's estimates have recently been on the rise, as seen in its Stock Checkup. 
"
171,LLY,"Shares of Biogen (BIIB) shot up Tuesday on a report that some big drugmakers are exploring the possibility of buying the company.The Wall Street Journal said in an anonymously sourced report that Merck (MRK) and Allergan (AGN) had both talked to Biogen about the possibility, though the talks were ""informal and preliminary."" Biogen stock, which had been down slightly for the day, then jumped and closed up 9.4% to 330.11 in the stock market today, hitting a one-year high.Wall Street has been tossing around the possibility of a Biogen takeout for some time, but rumors started to heat up after CEO George Scangos announced his retirement last week. RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee noted in a video last weekend that this leaves Biogen ""vulnerable"" to a takeover, especially since investors have gotten restless with the slowdown in the company's multiple-sclerosis franchise and risky pipeline.Among the most talked-about pipeline drugs is aducanumab for Alzheimer's disease, which might explain some of Merck's interest. Merck is working on a different class of Alzheimer's treatments called BACE inhibitors, but it could be thinking like Eli Lilly (LLY) that the disease will ultimately be treated with a combination of drugs. Allergan inherited a drug treating Alzheimer's symptoms with its acquisition of Forest Laboratories a few years ago, so it could presumably leverage its sales force.No other companies were named, but Yee opined that Roche (RHHBY) would also be a logical buyer, given that it already has a partnership with Biogen selling lymphoma drug Gazyva.Merck fell 0.6% Tuesday while Allergan lost 1.6%. Roche climbed 0.2%.
"
172,LLY,"Small biotech Alder Biopharmaceuticals (ALDR) surged Monday after it reported positive data in the ongoing race for the next big migraine treatment.Alder was following up on a phase-two trial that it had first reported last March, when 31% to 33% of patients (depending on the dose) who received a single intravenous infusion of Alder's anti-CGRP antibody ALD403 enjoyed at least a 75% reduction in migraine days over 12 weeks. After 24 weeks, between 29% and 31% experienced the same reduction, vs. 20% of the control group.Alder is competing with big names Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA), Amgen (AMGN) and Eli Lilly (LLY) to bring an anti-CGRP antibody to market.Leerink analyst Joseph Schwartz wrote that, so far, the clinical-trial data haven't much differentiated the drug candidates from each other, but the fact that patients taking a single dose of ALD403 as low as 30 mg improved pointed toward a possible advantage.""A surprising degree of durability in 30 mg suggests a potential subcutaneous formulation in the upcoming Phase 3 PROMISE2 trial,"" Schwartz wrote in a research note. ""Alder could benefit from tapping both the IV and self-administration (e.g., subcutaneous) markets to differentiate ALD403 from its anti-CGRP competitors.""Teva's anti-CGRP antibody produced similar results with a monthly subcutaneous dose, noted Evercore ISI analyst Umer Raffat in an email.Alder stock ended the trading day up 6.1% to 28.72 on the stock market today. Teva was down a fraction to 54.33, while Amgen rose fractionally to 166.56 and Lilly edged up to 81.98.IBD'S TAKE: Alder Biopharma has no product on the market, so it's a very risky investment. Amgen, though, is one of the strongest biotech stocks, rating No. 5 in the industry group. See Amgen's Stock Checkup to learn why. 
"
173,LLY,"Type 2 diabetes is battled by some of the best-selling drugs from some of the world's biggest drugmakers, but these companies are eyeing even bigger sales with a new generation of treatments.While changes in this field have proved more evolutionary than revolutionary, several events in the next few months -- starting as soon as Monday -- could eventually move billions of dollars, make compliance with treatment easier, and even prevent death from heart disease.Diabetes drugs provide the single best-selling products for Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Merck (MRK), while almost all of Novo Nordisk's (NVO) $16 billion in annual revenue comes from diabetes treatments. Health care research firm GlobalData says diabetes treatments will bring in nearly $60 billion by 2025.""We're getting better and better at managing diabetes in general,"" said Les Funtleyder, health care portfolio manager with E Squared Asset Management. ""We have more options. ... The next phase is going to be getting people to adhere to regimens that work.""For diabetes patients -- and Type 2 diabetes is one of the world's most common diseases -- sticking to their treatments can be difficult because the medication routine gets increasingly complicated as the disease progresses.If diet and exercise fail, patients go on oral drugs, starting with cheap generics such as metformin. If that proves insufficient, doctors can add newer, branded oral medicines, which come in two classes: DPP4 inhibitors, led by Merck's Januvia, and the more recent SGLT2 inhibitors, led by J&J's Invokana. The two classes work by different mechanisms but are sometimes combined.If yet further intervention is required, patients move to injectable drugs. Nowadays, the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogs are usually the first line of attack, a class including Novo Nordisk's Victoza and Eli Lilly's (LLY) Trulicity.IBD'S TAKE: Eli Lilly stock had a nice five-year run that ended about a year ago. Now, it sports weak Composite and Relative Strength Ratings of 34 and 39, respectively, and shouldn't get much of your stock-picking attention. But the company aims to rebound, as the CEO told IBD in an exclusive Q&A this year.After that comes the most familiar treatment for diabetes: insulin. Modern insulins come in different varieties, including long-acting versions like Sanofi's (SNY) Lantus and Novo's Tresiba, which need to be injected only once a day, and faster-acting ones for use at mealtimes, such as Lilly's Humalog and Novo's NovoLog.With this pile-up of meds, patients can have trouble keeping up. So one approach to simplifying the routine is creating combination drugs, as was done successfully with the HIV market.Both Sanofi and Novo Nordisk are awaiting FDA decisions on their combinations of insulins and GLP-1s, after back-to-back FDA advisory panels in May recommended approval. Novo's Xultophy won unanimous support, while Sanofi's LixiLan had a couple of dissenters due to safety issues related to the pen injector used to administer the drug.The FDA's deadline for deciding on Xultophy is Monday. The Sanofi decision is due next month, but it hasn't revealed the specific deadline.Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez sees blockbuster potential in both drugs, though he expects they'll take 10 years to hit peak sales.""As we have seen with other recent major primary-care launches such as PCSK9s (Sanofi/Regeneron (REGN)/ Amgen (AMGN)), Entresto (Novartis (NVS)), and Breo Ellipta (GlaxoSmithKline (GSK)), we expect a slow initial launch of this class in the first few years,"" Fernandez wrote in a May 26 research note.""In our view, Novo's Xultophy could have a slight upper hand in the drug/device profile and positioning in the treatment algorithm that could lead to better physician acceptance and market uptake,"" he said. ""In our overall diabetes model, we forecast $5 billion peak sales for Xultophy and $1.5 billion to $2 billion peak sales for LixiLan.""Another FDA decision much anticipated on Wall Street is on an already approved drug, Lilly's SGLT2 inhibitor Jardiance. Last year, Lilly stunned the industry when a large, five-year trial showed that Jardiance significantly extended the lifespans of diabetes patients, reducing the death rate by 32% and death from cardiovascular causes by 38%. It also sharply reduced hospitalizations for heart failure.Some analysts said Jardiance should see an instant uptick in sales, so spectacular were the results. When that didn't happen, Lilly closely studied the issue, says Enrique Conterno, president of Lilly Diabetes.""For us to realize that potential, two things need to happen,"" Conterno told IBD. ""The first is that we need the data on our label. And the second is we need new treatment guidelines to be established.""Canada's already made changes in the relevant medical societies' treatment guidelines, Conterno says, and he expects the same in the U.S. early next year.Getting the label changed means that Lilly's sales reps will be able to talk about the cardiovascular benefits to customers, which is important since the primary-care doctors who write most of the diabetes prescriptions aren't always up on the specialist research.Lilly has applied to expand the label to include that information, or at least put the clinical-trial results in the packaging.Approval, however, isn't quite the slam-dunk one might expect from the trial results. That's because of the way Lilly designed the trial. Its primary endpoint, which is normally the most important one to the FDA, was a composite of different measurements of cardiovascular health, and that produced mixed results. The specific findings in heart failure and overall deaths were ""exploratory"" endpoints.Thus, the FDA advisory panel only narrowly recommended changing the label when it met on June 28. Changing the label on the basis of a secondary endpoint would set a precedent, so it remains so unclear what the FDA will do that one analyst compared it to a coin flip.""We view approval for an actual CV death indication as having coin-flip odds, given the unprecedented nature/results of the trial,"" wrote Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum in an email on June 29. ""That said, we also feel that there's a better chance the FDA would allow this data to be added to the label.""It also remains to be seen how the competition will shape up.Last month, Novo Nordisk reported that its GLP-1, called Victoza, also reduced cardiovascular death, though not quite as much as Jardiance. Since Jardiance is oral and Victoza is injectable, they occupy slightly different positions in the treatment regimen.But Jardiance's most direct competitor, J&J's Invokana, is also the subject of a cardiovascular outcomes trial due for completion in February, with initial results possibly coming out earlier.Because of all these different variables, the companies that will do best in diabetes are those with the broadest portfolios, Funtleyder says. He cites Lilly and Novo Nordisk has having particularly comprehensive programs.""That gives them some advantages on a salesforce leverage basis -- the same sales guy can sample multiple drugs,"" he said. ""They have some benefits with payers (because) they can bundle the drugs together (on) one big bill instead of PBMs (pharmacy benefit managers) having to negotiate separate pills.""Eli Lilly shares rose 1.5% on the stock market today to their best levels since late January. Novo Nordisk climbed 1.1%. J&J dipped 0.1%. 
"
174,LLY,"Big U.S. pharmas AbbVie (ABBV) and Merck (MRK) traded higher Friday after both reported estimate-beating Q2 results Friday, while their French counterpart Sanofi (SNY) closed virtually flat.AbbVie's quarterly sales of $6.45 billion grew 18% from the year-earlier quarter and passed analysts' consensus by $250 million, largely on the strength of U.S. sales of immunology drug Humira. U.S. sales of blood-cancer drug Imbruvica also beat expectations.AbbVie slightly increased and tightened its full-year EPS guidance, calling for 11% growth over last year.Shares finished 2.3% higher at 66.23 on the stock market today.Merck also beat estimates, though more narrowly, and raised the low end of its full-year EPS guidance range. Merck also announced Friday that its hepatitis C drug Zepatier had been approved in the European Union, six months after its U.S. approval. Zepatier sold $112 million in Q2, beating the consensus by $3 million.Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum noted that Merck's best-selling diabetes drug Januvia seems to be holding up against competition from Eli Lilly's (LLY) Jardiance. Cancer drug Keytruda beat consensus largely on international sales.""Recall Merck recently announced the success of their Keynote-024 trial in first-line NSCLC (non-small-cell lung cancer), and the attentions of investors in the coming year will focus on performance in that indication,"" Schoenebaum wrote in an email.Merck stock edged up 0.4% to 58.66.IBD'S TAKE: AbbVie ranks No. 2 in IBD's Medical-Ethical Drugs group for its solid financials and decent stock performance, but the group overall is just No. 166 out of 197 total. Check out IBD Industry Themes to take the temperature of stocks' industry groups.Sanofi, meanwhile, missed sales estimates for the quarter, though it affirmed its full-year EPS guidance. In contrast to Merck, Sanofi's diabetes franchise has been shrinking in the face of competition, dropping 7% in the U.S. and 3% worldwide.In other noteworthy news, Japan's Astellas, the marketing partner to Sanofi's takeover target Medivation (MDVN), reported its quarterly financials suggesting that Medivation's lead drug Xtandi missed its U.S. sales consensus, though globally they were in line.Medivation stock rose 2.4% to 63.98, hitting a 14-month high and edging past a 63.04 buy point. Sanofi closed up 3 cents to 42.63.

175,LLY,"Eli Lilly (LLY) stock bounded Thursday after a federal appellate court upheld the patent on chemotherapy Alimta vs. generic drugmaker Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) — the third U.S. court in three years to do so.The U.S. Court of Appeals ruled early Thursday that proposed generics from Teva Parenteral Medicines, a subsidiary of the No. 1 generic drugmaker by the same name, would infringe on Eli Lilly's patent for Alimta.Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez says the decision removes an overhang on Lilly stock. The stock closed 2016 down 13%, though that still outperformed the broader industry. IBD's 44-company Medical-Ethical Drugs industry group plunged 25% last year.Lilly stock rose 2.5% in the stock market today to 77.15, again rising above its 200-day moving average support line.""This is also an important benefit to Lilly's long-term sales guidance of 'at least 5%' through 2020, particularly in the wake of Merck's (MRK) surprise BLA (Biologics License Agreement) for Keytruda in combination with Alimta for non-small cell lung cancer.""IBD'S TAKE: Drug stocks tanked Wednesday after President-elect Donald Trump commented in his first post-election news conference that he views the drug industry as ""disastrous"" and vowed to ""create new bidding procedures."" Grab IBD's Industry Themes for the deep dive.Fernandez models $1 billion in U.S. Alimta sales in 2017. Immuno-oncology combos, like one being tested now by Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), could competitively pressure Lilly and Merck's IO and chemo combination, he noted.But analysts broadly expect Bristol-Myers' IO/IO combo to hit shelves in 2018, giving Lilly and Merck a several-month advantage. The IO plus chemo combo could also potentially be expanded to a larger range of patients.Meanwhile, Alimta patent litigation is ongoing in Europe, where Lilly hasn't fared as well. In 2015, a U.K. trial ended with a judge ruling that a generic chemotherapy wouldn't infringe on Lilly's Alimta patent in the U.K., France, Spain and Italy. A patent case is still unfolding in Germany.Fernandez estimates that $500 million to $800 million in Alimta sales are at risk in Europe. But he kept his outperform rating on Lilly stock. In midday trading on the stock market today, Lilly stock lifted 2.7%, above 77.RELATED:Lilly Nears FDA Nod On Arthritis Drug, But Chemo Med Stuck In CourtLilly Spikes On 2016 Guidance, Clawing Back From Alzheimer's Flop

176,LLY,"SAN FRANCISCO — Less than an hour after President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to the drug industry as ""disastrous,"" Alder Biopharmaceuticals (ALDR) CEO Randall Schatzman classified the tone at the 35th annual JPMorgan Healthcare Conference as ""cautiously optimistic.""That's a wide departure from the 2016 event. At that time, he said, sentiment was decidedly pessimistic as the U.S. entered what turned out to be a raucous election year. The drug-pricing debate is alive, but biotech sentiment is growing stronger this year, Schatzman told IBD in an interview at the conference, one of the drug industry's major events, held this week in San Francisco.""Talking about the biotech industry as a whole, I think it's finally come to maturity,"" he said. ""Over the last two years, almost 70 drugs have been approved that have come from innovation in biotechnology, not large pharma. So the dollars there are really paying us back, and we're seeing some real game-changers.""Among those, Schatzman included Alder's anti-CGRP migraine drug, which competes directly with similar meds from Eli Lilly (LLY), Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) and Amgen (AMGN). The migraine market is big enough that all four could grab a sizable share when their drugs hit shelves, likely in 2019.But he acknowledges Trump's comments didn't help stock prices. Holding his phone, Schatzman pulled up a screen of biotech stocks, red arrows indicating their descent. To that point, the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology Index (IBB) (an exchange-traded fund) fell 3% Wednesday. It rose a fraction both Thursday and Friday.IBD'S TAKE: Trump's commentary sent drug stocks into a tailspin on Wednesday. Get the deep dive on what it means for your drug and biotech picks on IBD's Industry Themes.So any rally Wall Street expected from the JPMorgan event didn't unfold. But here are five key takeaways investors could note for 2017 as Trump takes office, drug firms look to sidestep Lilly's Alzheimer's flop and M&A gets an early start.Trump isn't alone in his fixation on drug prices. Celgene (CELG) CEO Mark Alles parried back when a reporter questioned whether the No. 3 biotech would follow in Allergan's (AGN) footsteps, applying a so-called ""social contract"" to not raise prices more than 10% annually.Celgene has offered free access programs for years, Alles said, estimating the No. 3 biotech gives away 6% of its drugs each year for free. Drug-prices increases help fund R&D for new drugs, he added. CFO Peter Kellogg estimates Celgene reinvests 35% of its funds into R&D, when accounting for partnerships.Alles says Celgene goes through a ""thoughtful process,"" accounting for innovation and spending to bring a drug to market before it prices a new med. Schatzman used the same words to describe Alder's plan to price out its anti-CGRP drug, once it nears FDA approval and heads to market.But HealthPrize Technologies CEO Tom Kottler called pricing spikes the easy way out for drug companies. HealthPrize is a software-as-a-service firm that marries behavioral economics and consumer marketing to analyze and improve patient adherence to prescriptions.Pharma leaves about $637 billion in worldwide revenue on the table each year by not pushing patients to take their meds, Kottler told IBD. To bridge the gap, companies can bring new products to market, prompt doctors to write more prescriptions or raise prices. Typically, they choose the latter.They're missing out on easy money, Kottler says. But raising prices ""is the easiest thing for them,"" he said.Drugmaker Merck (MRK) announced its immuno-oncology (IO) drug Keytruda in combination with chemo — Eli Lilly's Alimta — had won priority review from the FDA in non-small cell lung cancer and has a Prescription Drug Free User Act (PDUFA) date of May 10.Meanwhile, Merck and Incyte (INCY) are moving Keytruda and epacadostat into phase 3 trials of four tumor types (non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, bladder cancer and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck). Incyte stock jumped 9.4% Jan. 9 on the news.But Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) is on Merck's tail, analysts say. Bristol-Myers is testing a combination of Opdivo and Yervoy, both IO therapies, in NSCLC. Analysts expect the Bristol-Myers readout in the first half of 2018. IO combos are likely to be more effective and durable than IO plus chemo, some say.On Monday, Japan's Takeda Pharmaceutical put down a $24 per share bid on Ariad Pharmaceuticals (ARIAD), an oncology firm based in Massachusetts. Ariad stock flew 73% on the news, helping shares of oncology firm Tesaro (TSRO) lift 3.7%.Tesaro stock and four IPOs led IBD's 420-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group in 2016, with each of those stocks seeing triple-digit gains. Tesaro jumped 157%, where the group overall fell 24% amid the painful election cycle.Now, analysts wonder if Tesaro's success and an oncology-minded atmosphere — reiterated by Takeda's offer on Ariad — could garner a bid for Tesaro. Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez sees a potential takeout price of $170 per share of Tesaro stock, which closed Friday at 156.41 after rising 6.4%.""While Tesaro remains well positioned to grow independently, a validated PARP inhibitor like niraparib (an ovarian cancer drug still in development) could offer a durable and strategically important product opportunity for multiple suitors,"" Fernandez wrote in a research report Jan. 9.Regeneron (REGN) and Sanofi (SNY) are asking a federal judge to stay a ban on their LDL-busting drug, Praluent, in the aftermath of a patent battle that landed in a win for No. 1 biotech Amgen. Praluent infringes on Amgen's patent for PCSK9 inhibitor Repatha, the judge said.Meanwhile, an LDL-buster from Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (ALNY) and The Medicines Co. (MDCO) is slowly advancing. On Jan. 9, The Medicines Co. announced a 180-day interim analysis from a study examining PCSK9si inclisiran. The data showed inclisiran significantly lowered LDL up to day 210.RBC analyst Adnan Butt expects six-month data to be similar on efficacy and safety. Details are expected during the 2017 American College of Cardiology conference in March in Washington, D.C. Inclisiran should do well on strong data despite the patent litigation for Amgen and Regeneron/Sanofi.""Inclisiran is differentiated and has no patent litigation overhang,"" Butt said in a research report Wednesday.Axovant (AXON) CEO Vivek Ramaswamy says the biotech and drug industry has ""utterly failed"" in Alzheimer's. Oncology, inflammation, cardiology — they've all seen significant advancements in the last 10 years. Neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and dementia, including those with lewy bodies, haven't, he says.""If we don't find a treatment, it's a major threat to society,"" he told IBD in an interview Wednesday. ""This is the single area in health care we have failed to deliver a major advancement in, in the last decade.""Ramaswamy says he was rooting for Eli Lilly in December. But Lilly's highly-lauded solanezumab failed to meet its primary endpoints in a late-stage trial, causing Lilly stock to plunge 10.5% the day of that announcement. Lilly's drug and a drug in development by Biogen (BIIB) work to remove plaque buildups in the brain associated with Alzheimer's.But that's a ""silver bullet"" theory, and Ramaswamy doesn't buy it. Instead, he sees it necessary to treat the various behavioral, psychological and neurological pieces of Alzheimer's and dementia. Axovant is aiming to build new therapies on top of older ones.Axovant is next is the Alzheimer's field to deliver a readout. Data are slated for Q3, he said. Ramaswamy is looking for just one major piece of news in Alzheimer's advancement. Says Ramaswamy, ""A rising tide will lift all boats.""

178,LLY,"Drugmakers Roche (RHHBY), Merck (MRK) and Pfizer (PFE) will likely disappoint on 2017 guidance, but AbbVie (ABBV) stock remained a ""top pick,"" Jefferies analyst Jeffrey Holford said in a Friday research report rundown ahead of Q4 earnings.On the stock market today, AbbVie stock fell 0.4% to 61.15. IBD's 44-company Medical-Ethical Drugs industry group fell 0.9%. Both fell below their 50-day moving averages this week.AbbVie is facing pressure as Amgen (AMGN), the No. 1 biotech by market cap, preps to deploy a Humira biosimilar. AbbVie's Humira, one of the world's top-selling drugs, is used to treat an array of diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.AbbVie's patents protecting dosing schemes for Humira are set to be deliberated in court Feb. 16. A patent on administering 40-milligrams of the D2E7 antibody every 13-15 days is set to expire June 2022. But that patent will likely be upheld, barring entrants like ""first-filer"" Amgen, Holford said.IBD'S TAKE: Though low on Holford's totem pole, Merck stepped alongside Eli Lilly and Biogen in 2016, each delivering two new drug approvals. Who else curried FDA support in 2016? Head to IBD's Industry Themes for more.""We see the 135 patent as a blocking patent for all potential Humira biosimilars in the U.S., given that it is assumed that all biosimilars must be developed to be dosed at the same concentration and frequency,"" he wrote.In a worst-case scenario, Amgen could launch a Humira biosimilar in mid-2018, which assumes the ""first filer"" doesn't launch at risk in 2017. Holford sees a $4 per share downside should a Humira biosimilar launch in 2018, given consensus expectations for a launch in 2019.Behind AbbVie, Holford lists Novartis (NVS), Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and AstraZeneca (AZN) as strong picks. Pfizer, Merck, Novo Nordisk (NOVO) and Sanofi (SNY) are on the opposite end of Holford's list. But he expects disappointing guidance from nearly every big-cap drugmaker.""We expect disappointing 2017 guidance from the majority of U.S./EU large-cap pharma, with Roche, Novartis, Pfizer and AstraZeneca likely disappointing on revenue guidance and Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Merck and Roche also expected by us to disappoint on (earnings per share) guidance,"" he wrote.Upcoming catalysts include data from Roche's APHINITY trial examining its Perjeta regimen in HER2 positive breast cancer. Though Holford leans toward a positive outcome, ""we sense a high degree of uncertainty,"" he wrote.Merck's Keytruda in combination with Eli Lilly's (LLY) Alimta is also piquing investor interest. The combination of immunotherapy and chemotherapy was granted priority review in first-line non-small cell lung cancer this month.Holford notes the FDA accepted the application on a small data set and, therefore, the combo is unlikely to see wide use. He also sees the consensus as too bullish on the combo and as undervaluing immunotherapy combinations from the likes of Bristol-Myers and AstraZeneca in first-line non-small cell lung cancer.RELATED:Gilead 2017 Outlook Hamstrung On Hep C, But RBC Bullish On Amgen, BiogenBristol-Myers Dives On Opdivo Setback, Will Get Keytruda RoyaltiesFDA Track Record Bodes Well For Merck Keytruda Plus Chemo: LeerinkTrump's 'Disastrous' Pharma View Doesn't Rattle JPMorgan Drug Conference

179,LLY,"Biogen (BIIB) and Eli Lilly's (LLY) amyloid hypothesis for fighting Alzheimer's is ""alive and kicking"" after presentations at the Clinical Trials of Alzheimer's Disease conference Friday, but Biogen stock underplayed the promising results on investor concern over a patient seizure.On the stock market today, Biogen stock fell 0.6% to 287.77. Early on, Biogen stock rose above its 50-day moving average, rising as much as 6% in high volume before later falling as much as 2.7%.Eli Lilly stock rose 1% to 67.85, in below average trading volume.On Nov. 23, Lilly stock plunged 10.5% following disappointing results for its Alzheimer's drug, solanezumab. Rival Roche (RHHBY) saw shares jump 2.8%, near 28, as of late-afternoon Friday.Yee likes Biogen stock fundamentally, but says the Alzheimer's market is crowded.Evercore analyst John Scotti cited a patient's seizure while receiving Biogen's aducanumab for the stock's fall Friday. But, he noted, Alzheimer's patients are six to 10 times more susceptible to seizures than healthy elderly people.IBD'S TAKE: Lilly's Alzheimer's drug may have flopped, but it has some potential also in the diabetes market, where one analyst says it could pull in $1.7 billion in 2025 on expanded Jardiance sales.As a result of the seizure, the patient temporarily experienced a loss of pulse. But the patient didn't die and no similar event occurred in the placebo population, Scotti wrote in a research report.""With 165 patients under aducanumab treatment for two years and only one event, seizure would seem to be rare (rate of 0.6% over two years, which is similar to the rate observed in historical AD (Alzheimer's disease) populations, 0.5% over 1.2 years),"" he wrote.Overall, though, the phase one-b results for aducanumab were promising. From a safety standpoint, 35% of patients in the titration arm experienced ARIA (brain swelling), which was down from 55% in the fixed 10-milligram dosing schedule.In terms of efficacy, titration and fixed-dosing patients saw a 0.7-point and 0.63-point reduction in Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR). That compares to placebo patients who worsened by 1.89 points, Scotti wrote.RBC's Yee sees Biogen as well-positioned and says Lilly's drug is promising.""Lilly data looks not as bad as expected and actually quite promising, showing modest but clear clinical benefits,"" he wrote. ""Biogen's drug is very well positioned as a more potent inhibitor and thus showing robust decline in insoluble plaque and leading to most robust clinical cognitive benefits.""Biogen and Eli Lilly are operating on the theory that the buildup on amyloid plaque in the brain leads to Alzheimer's. Their drugs aim to cut down on that buildup.Lilly's solanezumab missed its primary endpoint of improving cognition.""This therefore suggests that a better drug like (Biogen's aducanumab) is more likely to work since Lilly's drug works but just shows modest/minor statistically significant benefits and we think (Biogen's aducanumab) looks better and is more potent,"" Yee wrote in a separate research report.RELATED:Eli Lilly Continues Alzheimer's Push After Flop, Biogen Extends RiseCelgene, Kite, Spark Look To Sidestep Lilly Alzheimer's Flop

Merck and Bristol-Myers are locked in a battle over the non-small cell lung cancer market with drugs that leverage a patient's immune system to battle the cancer.Holford downgraded Merck stock to underperform, with a 48 price target. He expects strong Keytruda performance in 2017, followed by pressure in 2018 as rival drugs from Bristol, AstraZeneca and Roche chip away at Keytruda's market.IBD'S TAKE: Next year will be marked by a new presidency. What path will Donald Trump take on drug prices?""Merck screens poorly on many valuation metrics to us, and we have downgraded the shares to underperform,"" Holford wrote in a research report. In the same note, he upgraded Bristol stock to a buy, with a 69 price target.Holford expects two Opdivo trials to secure Bristol's future in 2017.More broadly, he prefers AbbVie (ABBV) and Eli Lilly (LLY) stocks in the U.S. and AstraZeneca and Novartis (NVS) stocks in Europe.He sees Pfizer (PFE), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Merck, Sanofi (SNY) and Novo Nordisk (NVO) as the least preferred stocks.RELATED:Gilead Must Pay Merck $2.5 BillionFor Hep C Patent; Agios Stock Anemic

181,LLY,"Celgene (CELG), Kite Pharma (KITE) and Spark Therapeutics (ONCE) are looking to sidestep Eli Lilly's (LLY) recent Alzheimer's flop ahead of the annual American Society of Hematology conference Saturday through Tuesday in San Diego, RBC and Evercore analysts said Wednesday.IBD's biotech group is down markedly since Nov. 23, when Eli Lilly announced that its solanezumab had failed to show a statistically significant effect on cognition in Alzheimer's patients, a failure that surprised analysts and investors. But on Nov. 23 itself, the group actually rebounded to the plus side after first falling.""Investors are trying to look at things with a more glass-half-full optimism,"" RBC analysts wrote in a research report ahead of the ASH conference. "" ... there are buyers looking to accumulate biotech given where we've come from over the past year.""IBD'S TAKE: Celgene is ranked fourth in IBD's 421-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group with a Composite Rating of 97, meaning it performs in the top 3% of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. It also checks in at No. 44 on the IBD 50 ranking of top-performing stocks. Get the Stock Checkup for your best bets in biotech.RBC likes Celgene, Kite, Spark, Prothena (PRTA), Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) and Seattle Genetics (SGEN). Evercore analyst John Scotti is keeping track of CAR T-cell therapies from Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) and Kite, and combination data from Celgene.Celgene is expected to unveil phase-three data on Revlimid in post-stem-cell-transplant multiple-myeloma patients. The expanded use could drive an additional $500 million to $1 billion in annual revenue and help Revlimid become the standard of care, RBC says.Celgene stock dropped 3% by the closing bell on the stock market today, to 118.51, after touching a one-year high of 127 on Nov. 9. IBD's 422-company Biomed/Biotech group was down 2.5% at the close Wednesday, and it's fallen 3.9% since Lilly's Alzheimer's trial announcement.Evercore's Scotti looks for Celgene to discuss early clinical data on a next-generation drugs using the chemical cereblon. CC-122 is aimed at diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), and CC-220 could treat sarcoidosis — growths of inflammatory cells on different body parts.In other areas, Celgene has partnered with Acceleron Pharma (XLRN) on luspatercept for anemia in patients with rare blood disorders and Agios Pharma (AGIO) for AG-221, which could treat mutated proteins that are tied to certain cancers. Scotti expects updates on those partnerships.Both look for CAR T-cell data from Kite in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, after Juno last week placed its JCAR15 trial on clinical hold following the deaths of two patients. Kite also has phase-two DLBCL data. Previous data show 80% and 76% overall response rates in transplant and chemo relapsed patients.This ""will likely support a broad label assuming in presentation the CR (complete response) remains strong,"" RBC analysts wrote. Six-month durability data is also important, but that won't be available until Q1, they noted.Other key reports include amyloidosis data from Prothena, hemophilia data from Spark, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) data from Alexion, graft vs. host data from Incyte (INCY) and Hodgkin lymphoma data from Seattle Genetics, RBC wrote.RELATED:Kite Pharma Soars As Cancer Drug Trial Supportive of FDA ApprovalEli Lilly's Alzheimer's Drug Fails Key Trial; Lilly, Biogen DiveAmgen, Biogen, Celgene Eye M&A In Trump's 'Pro-Biotech' World

(HPQ) earned 36 cents a share excluding items, up 20% year over year and matching views. Sales rose 2% to $12.51 billion, topping analyst estimates for $11.9 billion. But for the current Q1, HP sees adjusted EPS of 35-38 cents vs. views for 38 cents. HP shares tumbled. Enterprise information technology firm Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), the other half of the former Hewlett-Packard, earned 61 cents a share ex items, up 17%, on sales of $12.5 billion, down 7%. Analysts projected 60 cents and $12.8 billion. For the current quarter, HPE forecast a profit of 44 cents at the midpoint vs. consensus for 46 cents. HPE shares neared a buy point.RELATED:Cisco, HPE View: Overseas Cash Trumps Cautious OutlooksStrong Notebook PC Sales Give HP A Lift, But EPS Guide MissesDurable goods orders jumped 4.8% in October, their best gain in a year. Core capital goods orders, a business investment proxy, rose modestly. Meanwhile, October existing-home sales, which reflect actual closings, picked up to their fastest pace since February 2007. But new-home sales, which reflect more-recent contract signings, fell last month after a downwardly revised September. With mortgage rates rising in October and spiking after the election, borrowing costs could chill housing.Cloud-based life sciences software maker's Q3 EPS rose 83% as revenue climbed 34%, both beating views. Veeva Systems (VEEV) also gave bullish Q4 guidance. Veeva shares broke out to a new high, clearing a buy point.

183,LLY,"The drug industry's Q2 earnings season launches this week with three of its biggest names: Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) , Novartis (NVS) and Biogen (BIIB). Their broad portfolios could give investors a preview of how the business in general is doing.The big kahuna, Johnson & Johnson, on Tuesday morning is expected to report 1% year-over-year sales growth, but a modest decline in EPS to $1.68 a share. The stock hit a record high intraday Friday and is up 20% for the year. Credit ""strong pharma trends, and flight to safety and yield,"" wrote RBC Capital Markets analyst Glenn Novarro in his July 8 preview note.Analysts are expecting another good quarter for J&J's pharma business; Novarro wrote that based on prescription data from IMS Health (IMS), four of J&J's biggest drugs -- Remicade, Imbruvica, Invokana and Xarelto -- will beat consensus. Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan, in his July 10 preview, lowered his estimates for Invokana while raising them for Remicade and Xarelto. But he said he was concerned about the entry of cheaper biosimilar versions of Remicade later this year. Pfizer's (PFE) Remicade biosimilar was approved by the FDA in April.IBD'S TAKE: Most drug stocks have taken a pounding this year, but J&J has proved to be the exception. Last month our Stock Market Today column highlighted it as one of three standout defensive Dow stocks, and it's only gone higher since then.Biosimilars will also probably be a topic of discussion on Novartis' Q2 conference call, also Tuesday morning. On Wednesday, the Swiss drug giant's biosimilar version of Amgen's (AMGN) Enbrel won unanimous backing from an FDA advisory panel, making it likely to be Novartis' second biosimilar launch after its version of Amgen's Neupogen entered the market last year.Investors will also likely be interested in the performance of Novartis' two newest potential blockbuster drugs, Cosentyx for psoriasis and Entresto for heart failure. Both are first-in-class drugs that were approved in the U.S. last year, though Entresto so far has missed expectations while Cosentyx has enjoyed stronger uptake.Cosentyx also faced new competition in Q2, however, as Eli Lilly (LLY) launched a drug in the same class called Taltz.On Monday, Credit Suisse analysts cut their Q2 EPS estimate by 4% because the launches of the two drugs appear to be costing more than they'd expected. However, they wrote that the long-term outlook for the drugs look good, estimating $5 billion in peak annual Entresto sales. Peak Cosentyx estimates have been running about the same.Analysts expect that, as in Q1, Novartis' Q2 financials will suffer from the loss of patent protection for its leukemia drug Gleevec. Sales are seen falling 3% to $12.3 billion, with earnings down 6% to $1.18 a share.Novartis' stock is slowly recovering from a long slide from its July 20, 2015, peak of 106.84 to its April 1 low of 69.90. Shares found support at the 50-day line and in recent weeks has moved just above their 200-day, closing Friday at 81.61.On Thursday before the open, Biogen is expected to report a quarter of stronger growth but lower expectations, as its multiple-sclerosis franchise has missed expectations over the last several reports.Nonetheless, RBC analyst Michael Yee sees potential upside for its MS drug Tecfidera, and he expects Biogen to raise its 2016 EPS guidance ""from current $18.30-18.60 EPS up more toward consensus around $19, depending on expense cuts."" That would represent a significant improvement over last year's $17.01.For Q2, analysts estimate that earnings grew 11% to $4.69 a share, while revenue gained 8% to $2.8 billion.Biogen stock, after crashing last July, has been trading above and below its still-sliding 50-day line for most of the months since. Biogen did close above its 50-day line on Friday. Aside from a brief late May-early June stint, Biogen has not been above its 200-day for nearly a year.

184,LLY,"The first half of 2016 was an exceptionally difficult one for drug stocks, not just because of overall sentiment but because of a relative dearth of good news compared with the previous few years.The second half of the year, however, will bring some very important clinical-trial news from several leading players, with the potential to move stocks sharply. Here's a look at some major events ahead:• Probably the most anticipated data drop of the year is Eli Lilly's (LLY) initial report on its Alzheimer's disease drug solanezumab, expected in December. With almost 50 million sufferers worldwide, Alzheimer's is one of the largest diseases that doesn't have a current treatment. And the many companies that have attempted to create one have a long history of failure.The phase-two trials suggest that solanezumab isn't a miracle cure -- it only created a statistically significant improvement when Lilly parsed the data to focus on early-stage cases. Lilly created a patient pool for its phase-three trial, Expedition 3, composed entirely of such cases. In an interview this year, Lilly CEO John Lechleiter told IBD that Alzheimer's will probably be treated by more than one product, ""not unlike the way diabetes is treated today, not unlike the way cancer is treated.""Lilly at first had two primary endpoints for the trial: improvement in cognitive decline and improvement in functional decline. However, in March it demoted the functional-decline measurement to a secondary endpoint, which analysts took as a sign that Lilly thinks it might miss that one. Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan noted that pooled data from the previous two trials showed a 34% impact in slowing cognitive decline, but only a 17% impact in slowing functional decline.""From a regulatory perspective, however, being able to show signs of a functional benefit remains important, and on this point we are now incrementally more cautious,"" Divan wrote in a March 15 research note.Biogen (BIIB) and its investors will be among the interested spectators of Lilly's report. Biogen's earlier-stage drug aducanumab is based on the same theory as solanezumab, that reducing the amyloid plaques that form in Alzheimer's patients' brains will slow the disease progression. So far, this hypothesis hasn't been definitively proven.• Gilead Sciences (GILD) also has a risky but potentially high-reward program in the works, though it's garnered somewhat less attention. After all but conquering hepatitis C with its drugs Sovaldi, Harvoni and Epclusa, Gilead has turned its attention to hepatitis B, a virus even more common than hep C and with only a 5% cure rate with current treatments.In a June 23 report, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said Gilead Chief Science Officer Norbert Bischofberger is placing the most confidence in GS-9620, which this year will read out its first data in humans.""Dr. Bischofberger explained that the first cohort for these studies is always virally suppressed patients, and the data should be available for these patients for presentation during November's American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) conference; data from the second cohort, virally naive patients, should be available at next year's European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) conference,"" Porges wrote.• Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and its big-pharma partner Sanofi (SNY) could report the first data on whether their cholesterol-lowering drug Praluent can reduce death from cardiovascular disease. Full results from the trial aren't expected until next year, but Regeneron will do an interim analysis to see if results have achieved ""overwhelming efficacy"" that would justify stopping the trial early.Initially, Amgen (AMGN) was expected to be the first to report such data on a PCSK9 inhibitor, the class of drug to which Praluent and Amgen's Repatha belong. In early June, however, Amgen pushed that report to early 2017.Praluent and Repatha have both underperformed expectations since they launched last year, but Regeneron and Amgen have warned that sales would likely be slow until they could prove to payers that their drugs actually improve patients' health. In its Q1 earnings report in April, Amgen said that 77% of Repatha prescriptions were rejected at the pharmacy because they require prior authorization from the insurer.Biogen shares rose 1.3% on the stock market today. Gilead Sciences climbed 1.7%, Regeneron 2.65% and Amgen 1.4%.IBD's Take: Biogen, Gilead and Regeneron are all trading well off their highs, below their 50-day and 200-day moving averages as investors worry about slowing growth and drug pricing pressures from regulators and politicians. 
"
185,LLY,"British big pharma AstraZeneca (AZN) licensed two skin-disease drugs to Denmark's LEO Pharma on Friday, including one formerly licensed to troubled U.S. drugmaker Valeant Pharmaceuticals International (VRX).AstraZeneca had struck a deal with Valeant in September to commercialize brodalumab, a psoriasis drug originally developed with Amgen (AMGN) but which Amgen had abandoned when reports of suicidal thinking emerged from its clinical trials. While the numbers were small, the psoriasis field is fiercely competitive, and the class of drugs to which brodalumab belongs already produced Novartis' (NVS) Cosentyx and Eli Lilly's (LLY) Taltz, which launched successfully without such problems.Valeant acquired rights to brodalumab for $445 million just weeks before a scandal erupted about its accounting and specialty-pharmacy relationships that eventually brought a change in management and a 90% drop in the stock price. Valeant still has commercialization rights for brodalumab outside Europe, and on July 19 it's scheduled to make its case before an FDA advisory panel, hoping for an endorsement before the FDA makes its ultimate decision whether to approve it by Nov. 16.AstraZeneca didn't specify the financial terms of the transfer, but it said that LEO is paying $115 million upfront, plus up to $1 billion in milestones, for global rights to tralokinumab as a treatment for atopic dermatitis, a type of eczema. AstraZeneca will retain rights to commercialize it as an asthma treatment.Valeant stock rose as high as 21.65 intraday, settling for a 1.5% gain to 20.44 on the stock market today. That's a huge comedown for a stock that peaked above 263 last August. AstraZeneca stock closed 0.8% higher at 30.42.
"
186,LLY,"Big pharma Eli Lilly (LLY) jumped Wednesday as Wall Street analysts weighed the results of a narrow Food and Drug Administration advisory panel vote late Tuesday.The panel met to decide whether it's a good idea to expand the label of Lilly's diabetes drug Jardiance to include reduced death from cardiovascular causes, based on a large clinical trial called Empa-Reg. The committee voted 12 to 11 in favor of the change. Such a close vote leaves it less than clear just what decision the FDA will ultimately make.""The most cited reason for a 'No' vote was that the bar for a new claim to be granted based on a SINGLE study is very high, and panelists would like to see a second trial to 'confirm' the CV death finding,"" Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez wrote in a research note. ""Many panelists who voted 'Yes' also shared that concern, but they found the CV death benefit compelling and convincing enough to tip the balance for them.""Fernandez nonetheless liked the odds of approval, noting that ""most of the senior members of the panel, including two biostatisticians, and ALL five cardiologists, voted in favor of the new indication.""Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan is also betting in favor of a change, adding that this could read across to similar products in the SGLT-2 inhibitor class.""Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) Invokana remains the market leader in the SGLT-2 space, with its CANVAS outcome study scheduled to be completed in February 2017,"" Divan wrote in a research note. ""Assuming the FDA agrees with including the EMPA-REG OUTCOME CV death data into the Jardiance label, we could see some share shift from Invokana to Jardiance until CANVAS is completed, with longer-term implications dependent on the CANVAS results.""Results from outcome studies for AstraZeneca's (AZN) Forxiga and Merck (MRK)/Pfizer's (PFE) ertugliflozin are expected later in the decade,"" Divan said.Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum was more cautious.""Despite the slight overall majority of votes in favor of the new CV indication, we view approval for an actual CV death indication as having coin-flip odds, given the unprecedented nature/results of the trial,"" Schoenebaum wrote in an email to clients. ""That said, we also feel that there's a better chance the FDA would allow this data to be added to the label instead (no indication statement).""Lilly stock rose 4% to 78.13 on the stock market today, near 77, once again above its 50-day moving average. Lilly closed just below its 200-day line, where it's been for the past five months.Johnson & Johnson stock closed up 0.9% at 119.33, a fresh record high.
"
187,LLY,"Drug giants Eli Lilly (LLY) and Gilead Sciences (GILD) both face key Food and Drug Administration actions this Tuesday that will affect the future of their leading disease-treatment franchises.An advisory committee to the FDA will meet to discuss expanding the label of Jardiance, Lilly's 2-year-old drug for treating type 2 diabetes. What Lilly wants to add to the label is that the drug also reduces death by cardiovascular causes, hospitalization for heart failure, and the risk of death in general.Those claims are based on a large, long-term trial called EMPA-REG, the results of which surprised the industry last year. Patients on Jardiance showed a 38% reduction in death from cardiovascular causes, a 35% reduction in hospitalizations for heart failure, and a 32% cut in deaths from all causes. If the FDA approves the label expansion, Lilly's sales reps will be able to use this in marketing the drug.The problem, according to Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez, is that those were not the primary endpoints of the trial; they were secondary, ""exploratory"" endpoints. The primary endpoint was a three-point measurement of major adverse cardiac events (MACE): the time to the first cardiovascular-related death, non-fatal heart attack and non-fatal stroke. On that, results were more mixed: Only on the first point did Jardiance achieve a statistically significant difference, while the non-fatal stroke incidence was actually slightly higher than in the placebo group.When the FDA released its briefing documents for the panel Friday morning, in fact, the conclusion affirmed that the study does show a reduction in CV death, but advised against including the MACE, heart-failure and all-cause death info on the label. This was nonetheless interpreted positively by analysts, and Lilly stock was up 0.5% on the stock market today despite the general Brexit sell-off.""The panel also consists of a substantial portion of cardiologists, which will help tilting the balance towards highlighting the CV benefit during the panel, in our view,"" Fernandez wrote in a research note Friday. Previewing the event on June 2, Fernandez had predicted the panel would be ""a battle of 'statistical purists' vs 'clinicians,' "" adding that ""clinically, the large and consistent CV death benefit seen in the EMPA-REG trial is viewed to be precedent-setting.""That precedent will also be of interest to Novo Nordisk (NVO), which recently reported that a similar study of its diabetes drug Victoza also brought a reduction in cardiovascular deaths, though not to the extent that Jardiance did. Novo Nordisk has said that it will also file for a label addition but hasn't yet decided on the language. The Danish diabetes specialist fell 4.4% Friday.Tuesday will also be the deadline for the FDA to decide whether to approve Gilead's latest hepatitis C pill. Gilead's last two hepatitis C launches, of Sovaldi and Harvoni, broke financial records, but those were restricted to certain genotypes of the virus. The new pill would be approved for all genotypes, not only enlarging the market, but also removing the need to test the patient's genotype before writing a prescription.Wall Street has no doubt that the FDA will approve the drug, but the interesting question is how Gilead will price it. When it launched in December 2013, Sovaldi gained notoriety for its price of $84,000 for a 12-week regimen, while Harvoni (launched in October 2014) was more than $94,000.However, when AbbVie (ABBV) launched its competing Viekira Pak in December 2014, the two companies started a rebating war that hit Gilead's income.Then this January, Merck (MRK) priced its new HCV drug Zepatier well below both, which both Gilead and AbbVie acknowledged hit their Q1 financials. It remains to be seen how Gilead values the pan-genotypic nature of the new drug.Gilead stock was down 3.5% Friday, hitting a 2-year low. AbbVie sank 2.4% and Merck 3.1%
"
188,LLY,"Shares of Danish diabetes-treatment giant Novo Nordisk (NVO) gapped down to a three-month low after one of the company's drugs proved able to reduce risk of death from heart attacks and strokes, but not as much as a rival drug from Eli Lilly (LLY).Late Monday at the annual American Diabetes Association meeting, Novo presented the results of Leader, a trial tracking the long-term cardiovascular (CV) outcomes of more than 9,000 patients using Novo's diabetes drug Victoza. Novo had already said on March 4 that the drug had lowered CV deaths compared to the placebo group, driving its stock up 8%. But analysts were eager to see in Monday's presentations whether Victoza could match Lilly's Jardiance, which in a similar trial cut CV deaths by 38% and produced an overall relative risk reduction of 14%.The answer was: not quite. Victoza cut CV deaths by 22%, and its relative risk reduction was 13%. Of particular concern was that the North American subgroup in the global trial did not show a significant effect on these metrics, which Novo said was due to uncooperative patients.""Novo management indicated that for reasons that are still unclear, the N.A. patient groups tend to have lower compliance and adherence compared to global rates during large cardiovascular studies,"" Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez wrote in a research note Tuesday. ""Management suggested that when adherent and on drug treatment (no drug holiday) patients from N.A. were analyzed, the MACE (major adverse cardiac event) composite was actually slightly better than the global risk benefit.""Novo said it will file for a label update including the MACE endpoint with the relevant regulatory agencies, as Lilly has already done with Jardiance. An FDA advisory panel will meet to discuss Lilly's application on June 28.Novo Nordisk stock fell 4.75% to 52.12 on the stock market today.
"
189,LLY,"Eli Lilly (LLY) said Wednesday that its Alzheimer's treatment solanezumab failed to deliver statistically meaningful results in a stage 3 clinical trial, sending the drugmaker's shares sharply lower.Lilly said that Alzheimer's patients with mild dementia ""did not experience a statistically significant slowing in cognitive decline compared to patients treated with placebo."" Lilly said that solanezumab results were""directionally"" favorable, they were not enough to justify seeking regulatory approval.""The results of the solanezumab EXPEDITION3 trial were not what we had hoped for and we are disappointed for the millions of people waiting for a potential disease-modifying treatment for Alzheimer's disease,"" said Eli Lilly Chairman and CEO John Lechleiter in statement. ""We will evaluate the impact of these results on the development plans for solanezumab and our other Alzheimer's pipeline assets.""Investor hopes for Eli Lilly's Alzheimer's drug had been high. Lilly shares dived 11% to 67.46 in early-afternoon trade in the stock market today after trading earlier to 64.18, a 2-year low.Alzheimer's is a potentially enormous profitable field for drugmakers, but they have struggled to achieve notable success in treating the underlying progression of the disease.IBD'S TAKE: Donald Trump's election win suggests fewer regulatory hurdles for takeovers. Amgen, Biogen, Celgene and Gilead could look to M&A to replenish their drug pipelines.Biogen (BIIB) has shown some promise in early-stage trials of its treatment aducanumab. The FDA granted fast-track status to the Biogen treatment on Sept. 1. But the stock fell 4.2% to 304.71 after trading as low as 293.80.Merck (MRK) is moving to stage three trials for verubecestat, which safely lowers amyloid-beta, the protein linked to neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's patients. But it's unclear if that will reduce cognitive decline.Merck shares slid 0.7% to 61.26 intraday.Lilly said it will provide more data about the trial on Dec. 8 at the Clinical Trials on Alzheimer's Disease. Lilly will take a $150 million charge related to the trial. It will update 2016 financial results and offer 2017 guidance on Dec. 15.RELATED:Health Care ETFs Fall As Eli Lilly, Juno Add To Troubled Sector's WoesJuno Stock Plummets After 2 Patients Die; Rival Kite Recovers

190,LLY,"Eli Lilly (LLY) was downgraded Friday after its Alzheimer's drug failed a key trial, while Whiting Petroleum (WLL) and Deere & Co. (DE) had their price targets raised.The pharmaceutical giant was downgraded to market perform with a 64 price target at BMO Capital after Eli Lilly said Wednesday that its Alzheimer's drug, solanezumab, failed in a final-stage trial. The company will take a $150 million charge, or 9 cents per share, in the fourth quarter.Eli Lilly shares rose 1.65% to 69.12 in the shortened trading session on the stock market today, after diving 10.5% Wednesday.The shale exploration and production company's price target was raised to 12 from 10 by RBC Capital. Whiting is focused on the low-cost Permian Basin, which has seen an explosion in drilling activity this year, and the Rocky Mountains. It recently inked a deal to divest midstream assets in North Dakota.Shares sank 2.6% to 10.06 as lower crude prices weighed.RBC Capital raised the farm-equipment maker's price target to 98 from 80.

"
191,LLY,"Drug giant Eli Lilly (LLY) is poised for a jolly December, if data and rulings come in positive.Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan says all eyes are on new data for Eli Lilly's Solanezumab, an Alzheimer's disease drug that he predicts has a 60% probability of success. Legal decisions and regulatory rulings surrounding Lilly's Jardiance, Alimta and Trulicity also are expected next month.Eli Lilly stock could use a year-end bounce. Shares are down about 10% this year, falling 0.82% to 76.01 on the stock market today. IBD's 44-company Medical-Ethical Drugs industry group fell more than 1% Tuesday.Phase 3 data from Lilly's Sola is due ""any day now and definitely by year-end,"" Divan wrote in a research report Tuesday. Sola could act as a neuroprotector for patients with Alzheimer's. Its success could boost rival Biogen (BIIB), which has a similar drug in development.Divan predicts Lilly stock could soar more than 20% if Sola shows significant functional benefit, 10% if it shows a trend on function and 5% even if it shows no functional benefit. He predicts a 10%-15% drop if Sola misses on cognition.IBD'S TAKE: December could be jolly for more than just Eli Lilly. Drug stocks have rallied since the election of Donald Trump, who is seen as more business friendly than Hillary Clinton. But what happens if Trump makes good on his promise to repeal the Affordable Care Act? The outlook isn't as certain. Grab IBD's Industry Themes for a deeper dive.In addition, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is due to make a decision in December on whether to expand the label on Jardiance, a type 2 diabetes med. The risk is ""skewed to the downside"" as most observers are expecting FDA approval, Divan said.Also, patent litigation is ongoing for Lilly's Alimta, a chemotherapy for cancer in or near the lungs. But most expect the patent to expire in 2021-22, regardless, Divan noted.Also, in coming weeks Lilly is due to release an interim analysis of a study on type 2 diabetes drug Trulicity.But the news flow won't end there. Initial 2017 guidance is expected Jan. 4 and the FDA could approve baricitinib, a rheumatoid arthritis drug in conjunction with Incyte (INCY), by mid-January, he wrote.Baricitinib belongs to a class of drugs called JAK inhibitors. Gilead Sciences (GILD) is working on a JAK inhibitor, as is AbbVie (ABBV). Pfizer (PFE)has one approved and is currently in trials to expand its use. Incyte also has a JAK inhibitor on the market. Janus kinase (JAK) is a family of enzymes. Drugmakers believe blocking these enzymes could treat certain cancers and inflammatory diseases.Editor's Note: Corrects last graph on which companies are working on a JAK inhibitor or already have one on the market.RELATED:Gilead Could Scoop Up Incyte After Cancer Drug Proves 'Not Good Enough'Amgen, Gilead, Eli Lilly Eat Into AbbVie's Humira Sales: Analyst

All three indexes are at new highs. Small caps once again outpaced the overall market, sending the Russell 2000 up 5.5% through Thursday, also to a new high, and nearly 20% above an early November low.Tech stocks appeared set for a strong start as Singapore-based Broadcom (AVGO) rolled ahead 4%. The diversified chipmaker topped analysts' fiscal fourth-quarter sales and earnings targets and doubled its quarterly dividend. The stock broke out of a base with a 178.12 buy point of a flat base.Finisar (FNSR) soared at the open, but then reversed to trade down slightly. The maker of fiber optic networking gear's fiscal second-quarter results, reported late Thursday, cleared expectations, driven primarily by demand for the company's 100-gigabit network transceivers.  The stock is extended above a flat base buy point of 31.52.Sibanye Gold (SBGL) tanked 15% and Stillwater Mining (SWC) surged 18% after the companies announced Sibanye would acquire Stillwater for $2.2 billion. The third acquisition of a platinum miner in the past year would make South Africa-based Sibanye the world's largest platinum producer. Stillwater is based in a Denver suburb.Casino owners were rebounding with gusto: Wynn Resorts (WYNN) jumped 3.4%, Las Vegas Sands (LVS) climbed 4.1%, Melco Crown Entertainment (MPEL) spun up 6.3% and MGM Resorts International (MGM) added 3.6%. The group sold off Thursday on reports that Chinese regulators had moved to limit ATM withdrawals in the country's gambling haven of Macau. Casino stocks rose after the ATM curbs were less than feared.Drug maker Biogen (BIIB) popped nearly 5%. Biogen's once-monthly multiple sclerosis treatment Zinbryta had received approval from federal health regulators in Canada. Also, Eli Lilly (LLY) gave detailed results on its failed Alzheimer's drug, following promising data Thursday on Biogen's own treatment. Biogen has been trying since July to climb out of a long-term consolidation, but has been stymied by resistance near 330.Among down-bound stocks, Restoration Hardware (RH) plunged 16% as investors focused on weak fourth-quarter guidance, rather than strong third-quarter results in the company's report after Thursday's close. The stock has been trying since June to start up the right side of what is now a deep, 13-month correction.Economic news is limited on the stock market today, with the University of Michigan reporting its November consumer confidence numbers and the Commerce Department releasing October wholesale inventories data, both at 10 a.m. ET.

193,LLY,"Biotech stocks have nearly ""round-tripped"" their Donald Trump-inspired rally, but RBC analyst Michael Yee sees an upcoming U.S. Food and Drug Administration appointment, and data from Roche (RHHBY) and Biogen (BIIB) acting as catalysts.The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology (IBB) and SPDR S&P Biotech (XBI) exchange-traded funds are down 6.6% and 3.1% following a rally on Trump's election. On Wednesday, Trump dumped water on analysts' theory he would be less likely to go after spiraling drug prices.""I'm going to bring down drug prices,"" he told Time Magazine. ""I don't like what has happened with drug prices.""Trump's commentary sent biotech stocks tumbling on Wednesday. IBD's 421-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group closed down 3.1%. The iShares and S&P Biotech ETFs ended the day down 2.9% and 4%, respectively.After sinking more on Thursday, biotech stocks managed to climb out of the hole on the stock market today, IBD's 421-company biotech group was up fractionally as were the ETFs.IBD'S TAKE: Can biotechs recover from Trump's pledge to curb drug prices? Get the deep dive on IBD's Industry Themes.Yee noted Trump's effect extends far beyond his commentary. Trump has appointed Georgia Rep. Tom Price as his Health and Human Services secretary. Price has said he favors a major overhaul of the Medicare system, and has advocated against the Affordable Care Act.His next appointment, though, could light a fire under biotech stocks, Yee wrote. On deck, Trump is prepping to announce his next commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Media reports target Jim O'Neill and Scott Gottlieb as leading candidates.O'Neill is a former venture capitalist and managing director at Peter Theil's Mithril Capital. He has advocated for relaxing FDA regulations for drug approvals. Gottlieb is a VC partner and practicing physician who has served at the FDA and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.The decision will follow Congress' approval late Wednesday of a bill to speed up FDA processes.And Trump? His commentary on drug pricing is far from set in stone, Yee wrote in a research note. He notes the Republican Congress next year is unlikely to break from conservative dogma to work on easing drug prices.""Despite the worries about Trump mentioning drug pricing, we'd remind investors that he has said a lot of things over the past year and seems to negotiate in the public eye but hasn't necessarily been truly perceived to actually want to do a lot of them,"" Yee wrote.Outside Trump, biotechs have suffered industry-specific injuries including Eli Lilly (LLY) missing key Alzheimer's data, and lagging Q3 metrics from Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA) and Medtronic (MDT), Yee wrote. But Biogen and Roche have upcoming data that could help the industry.Biogen has phase 1 and 2 data for Alzheimer's drug aducanumab due Friday. Roche's phase 3 hemophilia data is due ""imminently,"" Yee said. The Prescription Drug Free User (PDUFA) is due Dec. 28 for Roche's multiple sclerosis drug ocrelizumab. And Regeneron (REGN) rival Ophthotech (OPHT) has phase 3 data coming soon.Meanwhile, M&A looks imminent for the sector. Johnson and Johnson (JNJ) is in talks to buy European biotech Actelion. Sanofi (SNY) is rumored to have informal interest in Actelion, insiders say. M&A could pull generalist investors back into the space, Yee wrote.There's a ""perception of no major near-term catalysts in biotech other than 'it's cheap' and we need much more M&A to get the stocks rallying again,"" he wrote.RELATEDCould Trump Tax Cut Plans, Republican Congress Spur Biotech M&A?Could Trump 'Make Drug Development Great Again'?

194,LLY,"NYSE stock indexes traded quietly mixed at midday Wednesday, but a negative headline in the biotech sector weighed on the Nasdaq composite.The Nasdaq lost 0.5%. Biogen (BIIB) was the worst decliner among Nasdaq 100 names, down nearly 6%. Shares fell  in sympathy with Eli Lilly (LLY), which tumbled 12% on news its Alzheimer's drug failed a key trial. Biogen also has a big presence in the Alzheimer's space.The S&P 500 eased 0.2%, and the Dow Jones industrial average added 0.1%, helped by Caterpillar (CAT) which rose 2%.

Hewlett Packard Enterprise slipped less than 1%, after reporting mixed Q4 results and also offered weak guidance.Among IBD 50 stocks, Veeva Systems (VEEV) surged 8%. The provider of cloud-based sales and marketing software reported an 83% earnings jump for its fiscal fourth quarter, far above analyst targets and the company biggest jump since last year's June quarter. A 34% revenue jump also easily cleared estimates and management raised its fiscal first-quarter guidance to above the consensus view.Veeva ended Tuesday's session less than 3% below a 42.56 buy point in an 11-week cup base.The stock market today receives a heavy dose of data, opening with the Commerce Department reporting durable goods orders surged 4.8% in October.  That sharply reversed September's 0.1% decline and clobbered economist expectations for a 1.5% increase.

196,LLY,"No. 1 biotech Amgen (AMGN) will likely score in a ""crowded field"" with a protein-blocking migraine drug that could beat rivals to market in 2018 and reap $1.2 billion in adjusted sales, Credit Suisse analyst Alethia Young says.Late Wednesday, Amgen reported strong phase 3 results for erenumab in patients with episodic migraines. Patients receiving 70-milligram and 140-mg doses experienced, respectively, a reduction of 3.2 and 3.7 monthly migraine days vs. a 1.8-day reduction in the placebo arm.The safety profile of erenumab was similar to that of the placebo and previous studies. The most common side effects included nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection and sinusitis.Amgen, the largest biotech by market cap, and partner Novartis (NVS) plan to file erenumab in 2017 with a potential launch date in 2018. Evercore analyst John Scotti expects Amgen to be first to market with an anti-CGRP. Calcitonin gene-related peptide receptors are closely tied to migraines, experts say.IBD'S TAKE: Amgen is doing well on migraines, but rebates are chipping away at its 2017 expectations. Could 2017 be a win or a flop? Check out IBD's Industry Themes for the full scoop.Pricing will be key for a strong launch, Credit Suisse's Young wrote in a research report. Erenumab has been tested in both chronic and episodic migraine patients and the company plans to file for labeling in both indications.""We broadly assume similar share vs. competitors in this market until we learn more about Amgen's commercial strategy,"" Young wrote. ""We also think pricing will be especially important for a successful launch given the high disease prevalence rates and substantial unmet need in the patient population.""The field is crowded by Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA), Alder Biopharmaceuticals (ALDR) and Eli Lilly (LLY), all of which have anti-CGRP drugs in their pipelines. Migraines cost U.S. businesses $13 billion annually as workers miss 113 million workdays, the Migraine Research Foundation estimates.In the stock market today, Amgen rose a small fraction and Lilly rose 1%. Meanwhile, Teva stock bounded 2.2%, while Alder stock fell nearly 1%.RELATED:Teva Pharma Outplays Peers Despite Light Q3 Sales, Lacking 2017 ViewsCould Trump 'Make Drug Development Great Again'?

197,LLY,"Eli Lilly (LLY) has a giant albatross hanging from its neck.RBC analyst Michael Yee calls the Clinical Trials for Alzheimer's disease conference next month in San Diego, ""the most important event in biotech."" And it's up to Eli Lilly to deliver strong results from its phase 3 trial on Alzheimer's drug solanezumab to stoke the industry, he says.Biotechs spiked higher after Donald Trump's election. Trump is seen as less likely to tackle mounting drug prices and has proposed incentives for companies to bring more cash stateside. That could spark more M&As for small-cap biotechs.Intraday on the stock market today, IBD's 421-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group was down a fraction but still above its 50-day moving average, a key level of support. The group closed higher the past seven straight trading days and ranks No. 27 out of 197 IBD industry groups.IBD'S TAKE: Alzheimer's isn't the only area of opportunity in biotech. Biogen and Ionis are partnered on a spinal muscular atrophy drug that could have interesting results. Delve into IBD's Industry Themes for some ideas on what success could do for the stocks.Outside the Trump effect, analysts have seized on Eli Lilly's solanezumab as a key driver for the industry, including rival Biogen (BIIB), which has a similar Alzheimer's drug on the line. Solanezumab is an antibody that could act as a neuroprotector for patients with Alzheimer's disease""We believe this event (the CTAD) will be an important near-term driver to potentially rally biotech higher and really take another leg up and bring in more generalists to the space,"" Yee said in his research note Tuesday.Eli Lilly's presentation is still just tentative. It is slated to present on Dec. 8, but Lilly has also said it could instead present data from Expedition, its phase 3 solanezumab trial, in a medical meeting in 2017. Positive data could give strong credence to Lilly's theory that Alzheimer's is the result of plaque buildup in the brain, Yee wrote.He sees a 30%-40% chance of positive, statistically significant data from the Expedition trial and, as a result, ""investors will get more bullish on Alzheimer's and 'innovation' in biotech.""Biogen is slated Dec. 9 to report phase 1b results of its 12-month titration study attempting to reduce ARIA (amyloid-related imaging abnormalities) in patients with a specific type of allele (an alternative form of a gene). It will also present a 24-month extension examining safety and efficacy.Biogen stock, which is consolidating and has a possible buy point of 333.75, ticked up 0.3% to 322.58 at the close Tuesday. Lilly stock inched up 0.4% to 77.32 and just above its 200-day support line.Novartis (NVS), which is partnered with Amgen (AMGN), will discuss it efforts at pairing Alzheimer's patients with trials based in part on genetics. Amgen's BACE inhibitor, which acts to block the buildup of beta-amyloid, has been proposed as one of two drugs in the study. Lilly, Merck (MRK) and Biogen also have BACE inhibitors.Roche (RHHBY), with partner Genentech, is expected to have posters on its phase 3 trial for crenezumab, looking at higher-dose response in prodromal/mild patients. Axovant will also offer an analysis of its phase 3 study on intepirdine.RELATED:Biotech Lilly Upgraded On Alzheimer's Drug's $7.5 Billion PotentialCan This Small-Cap Biotech Take On Gilead, Celgene, Biogen In Alzheimer's?Biogen Q3 Tops; Alzheimer's Data Vs.

"
200,LLY,"Injectable-drug specialist Eagle Pharmaceuticals (EGRX) stock was down sharply Monday after it got a downgrade from Mizuho saying that its thesis had played out.Eagle stock jumped 28% on June 10 when Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA) won a patent case against several generic drugmakers, including Pfizer's (PFE) Hospira unit and Sagent Pharmaceuticals (SGNT), that were trying to launch generic versions of its blood-cancer drug Treanda. In January, Teva and Eagle launched a low-volume, faster-acting version of Treanda called Bendeka, which it says it expects to replace Treanda on the market eventually.Mizuho analyst Irina Koffler wrote in her research note that she expects the companies to retain market exclusivity for Bendeka until 2019, but she said other catalysts might be slow in coming.""The Treanda/Bendeka switch is a genuine success story for Eagle, but its other hospital launches like Ryanodex and Docetaxel have been more challenging,"" Koffler wrote as she downgraded the stock to neutral from buy. ""We are reminded that cost is still critical within this setting, and this insight has influenced our longer-term outlook on Bendeka and the rest of Eagle's portfolio.""Koffler noted that Eagle is preparing to file for approval of a version of Eli Lilly's (LLY) lung-cancer drug Alimta, which is altered in a way similar to Bendeka's reformulation of Treanda, but she doubted that it will be as lucrative as the Teva deal.""We are concerned about competition from other 505(b)(2) filers like Allergan (AGN), who has already launched this type of product in EU,"" she wrote. ""For this reason, we think that replicating a Bendeka-like agreement could be challenging here.""Eagle turned its first annual profit last year, of 16 cents a share, which analysts expect to jump to $4.56 this year with the help of the Bendeka launch. The stock nonetheless has a single-digit Relative Strength Rating, and ended trading down 9% on the stock market today, to 40.76.
"
201,LLY,"Biogen (BIIB) said Tuesday that its risky but potentially transformative multiple-sclerosis drug candidate had failed its clinical trial, driving the big biotech's stock down sharply on Tuesday.Biogen said that its drug opicinumab, better known by its medical acronym anti-LINGO, hadn't met either the primary or secondary endpoints in its mid-stage trial, which measured improvements in physical and cognitive functions as well as disability and disease progression. Biogen nonetheless said that ""evidence of a clinical effect with a complex, unexpected dose-response was observed,"" so it was analyzing the results in hopes of designing another study.Anti-LINGO is a novel technology that promised to be the first to rebuild myelin -- the fatty layer around the nerve cells that erodes in MS patients -- and thereby actually reverse the progression of the disease. Results last year of an earlier trial of optic neuritis -- a form of vision loss in MS patients associated with demyelination -- were technically positive but ambiguous enough that expectations were low going into the MS results.""This was one of the most unknown, unpredictable major clinical events investors were trying to do work on,"" wrote RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee in a research note. ""It also reflects the challenging dynamic with the stock for many growth investors in that it is seen as a 'high risk, high reward' pipeline company, and it's hard to get conviction on the events without data despite lots of potential upside if it works.""Biogen's other high-risk, high-reward program is in Alzheimer's disease, which was very promising in earlier trials but is in a disease area with a long history of failure. The next batch of data on that isn't expected for more than a year, though an expected Eli Lilly (LLY) report on its own Alzheimer's drug late this year could provide some read-across, analysts say.Biogen shares tumbled 12.8% to 252.86 on the stock market today. The stock gapped below its 200-day and 50-day moving averages.
"
202,LLY,"Shares of pharma major AbbVie (ABBV) were sliding Wednesday after Morgan Stanley downgraded it on concerns of increasing competition.Analyst David Risinger downgraded AbbVie stock to equal weight and lowered his price target to 65 from 73, noting that the nature of AbbVie's pipeline has become clearer since its R&D day on June 1 and its presentations on its cancer drugs over the weekend, including its negatively received report on Rova-T. In the meantime, AbbVie still depends on its immunology drug Humira, the analyst said.""With 2015 sales of $14 billion, Humira is the world's best-selling drug and generated 61% of AbbVie's 2015 total sales (and we estimate the vast majority of profits),"" Risinger wrote. ""Humira not only faces challenges from several biosimilar players (including Amgen (AMGN), Novartis' (NVS) Sandoz, and Pfizer (PFE)), but also from novel branded injectables and orals.""If AbbVie can score a string of patent litigation victories, that may allay investors' concerns, but we are unable to make that call,"" Risinger wrote.Humira's market exclusivity already suffered one setback last month, when the patent board agreed to review a challenge to a Humira patent brought by biosimilar developer Coherus Biosciences (CHRS), though that likely will take years to resolve.Risinger wrote that newer classes of drugs treating the same conditions that Humira does, including Novartis' Cosentyx and Eli Lilly's (LLY) Taltz and baricitinib, should slow down Humira's growth in the near term.This threat gained some support Wednesday, when Novartis said that among its presentations at the European League Against Rheumatism conference, running Wednesday through Saturday, are ""new long-term analyses suggesting Cosentyx may lead to higher responses than Humira in improving the signs and symptoms of people living with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) at 52 weeks."" Novartis said it will initiate head-to-head trials to confirm this.""That said, AbbVie's own novel autoimmune disease products should help offset moderation, including JAK ABT-494 and IL-23 risankizumab,"" Risinger wrote. ""We expect both to launch in 2019.""AbbVie stock fell 2.1% at the close on the stock market today, to 61.73.

204,LLY,"Bristol-Myers Squibb vs. Merck, Pfizer vs. Lilly and a unique treatment from AbbVie (ABBV) will take the spotlight next week at the biggest drug conference focused on treatments for one of the biggest diseases: cancer.The annual meeting of the American Society for Clinical Oncology in Chicago on June 3-7 is a prime opportunity to check up on some potential blockbuster drugs.The abstracts for most of the presentations were released to the public on May 18, giving the gist of study results but leaving details for the conference itself. And some of the most interesting items for investors will be among the late-breaking abstracts.As in the past several ASCO meetings, the battle of the immunotherapies will be a major theme. The two marketed PD-1 inhibitors, Bristol-Myers Squibb's (BMY) Opdivo and Merck's (MRK) Keytruda, are already big sellers in skin and lung cancer, with Opdivo ahead in market share. But ongoing research will give an idea of their true market potential, as well as how they stack up against each other.As is often the case for cancer drugs, Opdivo and Keytruda were both approved for advanced cases of the disease first, but the largest market opportunity is for front-line treatment of newly diagnosed patients. Among the cancers, one of the largest market opportunities is in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which Bristol-Myers and Merck are targeting.In the first abstract release, Merck's Keynote-021 study of Keytruda in combination with chemotherapy yielded improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) of 10 months overall, and 14 to 15 months in patients whose tumors showed high expression of PD-L1, the ligand the PD-1 inhibitors indirectly target.""Here we continue to see solid ORR (overall response rate, or percentage of tumors that shrank) and PFS data, and look to the meeting to better understand the durability of the response over longer periods of time,"" wrote Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan in a May 19 research note.Bristol-Myers is also conducting first-line NSCLC studies. Its most significant might be Checkmate-012, which combines Opdivo with another Bristol-Myers immunotherapy drug, Yervoy. If that proves to be the most effective combo, then that would be huge for the company, since Bristol-Myers would wholly own the treatment and thus gain all the revenue from it.There was no new Checkmate-012 info in the early abstracts, but analysts hope it will be among the late-breaking data.Morningstar analyst Damien Conover says he also wants to see data on Tecentriq, Roche's (RHHBY) entry into a sister class of drugs that target the PD-L1 ligand directly. By coincidence, the FDA approved Tecentriq for a type of bladder cancer called urothelial carcinoma on the same day the ASCO abstracts were released.""They were first to file in bladder (cancer),"" Conover told IBD. ""Bladder's a big indication -- not as big as lung cancer, but having that niche for Roche will really help drive that drug's sale.""Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez, however, notes that Tecentriq could soon have competition, as shown in other ASCO presentations.""Initial data for Bristol Myers’ Opdivo and AstraZeneca's (AZN) durvalumab show higher response rates in this indication,"" Fernandez wrote in his May 19 research note. ""Beyond the smaller patient numbers in both data sets, baseline characteristics to be presented at ASCO should be closely watched.""A newer battle seems to be shaping up in a different drug class, called the CDK 4/6 inhibitors, used to treat breast cancer. The CDK stands for cyclin-dependent kinase, an enzyme tied to cell division, encoded in genes CDK4 and CDK6. The inhibitors help stop the cancer cells from multiplying.The first of these, Pfizer's (PFE) Ibrance, launched in early 2015 and took in $723 million last year. That's expected to swell into the billions eventually.Eli Lilly (LLY), however, has made some noise with its CDK 4/6 inhibitor abemaciclib, which showed a much higher response rate -- 25% -- in refractory patients than did Ibrance. In the ASCO abstract on Lilly's Monarch-1 trial, after eight months of treatment that number was only 17%, still better than Ibrance but a slight disappointment to Wall Street.At Lilly's R&D day on Tuesday, though, the company said it will also be presenting 12-month data at ASCO, so there could still be an upside surprise. Nonetheless, Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum wrote that Lilly executives didn't seem that enthusiastic.""Lilly seemed to not want to boost investor expectations with regards to the 12-month data, and therefore reiterated the 17% ORR results (reported at eight months) when asked,"" Schoenebaum wrote in an email to clients. ""Additionally, Lilly encouraged investors to also look at overall clinical benefit and duration of response during the presentation at ASCO.""Hovering in the background, though not at ASCO, is the Novartis (NVS) announcement May 18 that it had stopped its late-stage trial of its own CDK drug early because it had already hit its primary endpoint of improvement in PFS. The details on that will have to wait for a later medical meeting.""That's also a positive development for the space,"" analyst Divan told IBD. ""There's room for more than one winner.""Meanwhile, Pfizer scored a hit for its treatment with late-stage data showing that Ibrance in combination with estrogen blocker letrozole yielded PFS of more than 20 months, or 10 months more than letrozole alone.This prodded analyst Fernandez to raise his 2025 sales estimate for the whole CDK 4/6 class to $13 billion from $10 billion, and his 2021 estimate for Ibrance sales alone to $8.3 billion from $6 billion.Among the late-breaking data in other fields, one study that many on Wall Street are eyeing is the midstage trial of Rova-T, a drug that AbbVie is acquiring through the $5.8 billion buyout of biotech Stemcentryx. Rova-T is a treatment for small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), a smaller market than the enormous NSCLC population but a definite opportunity since it lacks a specifically approved treatment.Previous studies have shown a 44% response rate in relapsed patients with high expression of delta-like protein 3 (DLL3), which appears in 80% of SCLC patient tumors. The presentation at ASCO is particularly important because Stemcentryx will be reporting long-term survival data, which is the gold standard in cancer trials as far as the FDA is concerned.Analyst Schoenebaum says Rova-T will have to improve survival enough to differentiate itself.""We know that chemotherapy produces around six months' OS (overall survival) in the setting that they're testing Rova-T in,"" Schoenebaum said in a video recorded for clients on May 23. ""And we know that there was some data in the ASCO abstracts (showing) PD-1 plus Yervoy produced about eight months, but (with) a lot of toxicity.... But the punchline is we need to see OS data well in excess of six months.""AbbVie has estimated that peak annual sales of Rova-T could hit $5 billion.

205,LLY,"Big Pharma AbbVie (ABBV) said Tuesday that a recently licensed drug candidate succeeded in a phase-two trial of Crohn's disease, as the company seeks to refresh its blockbuster immunology franchise.In the late morning at the Digestive Disease Week conference in San Diego, AbbVie's researchers presented results from an ongoing phase-two study of risankizumab, a drug AbbVie licensed from Boehringer Ingelheim during the first quarter, in Crohn's disease. They said that after 12 weeks of treatment, 24% to 37% of patients were in remission -- depending on the dose -- compared with just 15% in the placebo group. The treated group also had fewer adverse events than the placebo group.Risankizumab is one of a newer group of drugs targeting interleukins, small proteins in cells associated with inflammation, among the proteins is TNF, or tumor necrosis factor.""These results are particularly encouraging because of the difficult-to-treat population within the study,"" researcher Brian Feagan said in a statement. ""Our patients had endoscopically confirmed moderate or more severe disease activity at study entry and the majority had previously failed treatment with one or more TNF antagonists.""The most popular TNF blocker happens to be Humira, AbbVie's flagship drug treating Crohn's disease as well as other immunological conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. Humira's patents are under fire, however, and last week AbbVie's stock tumbled when the patent board agreed to review a challenge to a methods patent brought by Coherus BioSciences (CHRS).Other drugs targeting interleukins include Novartis' (NVS) Cosentyx, launched early last year for psoriasis, as well as Eli Lilly's (LLY) Taltz, approved for psoriasis in March.Those drugs target interleukin (IL) 17, while risankizumab targets IL-23 through a novel mechanism of action.""The efficacy of this drug looks to be as good (as), or perhaps even better than IL-17,"" Evercore ISI analyst John Scotti said in a video for clients recorded May 3. ""And remember, Cosentyx peak sales in consensus right now are about $4 billion.""AbbVie stock ended trading up 2.4% on the stock market today to 60.70, and shares in the past week have found support at the 50-day moving average line.

209,LLY,"Big pharma Eli Lilly (LLY) issued mixed first-quarter earnings and guidance Tuesday, sending its stock down in early trading.Lilly's earnings, excluding one-time items, shrank 5% from the year-earlier quarter to 83 cents a share, missing analysts' consensus by 2 cents, according to Thomson Reuters. Revenue rose 5% to $4.87 billion, beating consensus by $45 million.Lilly added 5 cents to its 2016 EPS guidance range, now $2.68 to $2.78. It also raised its sales guidance slightly to $20.6 billion to $21.1 billion. At the same time, it shaved a percentage point off its gross-margin guidance, now 76%, as it also lifted its guidance for R&D and sales, general and administrative spending.Lilly stock was down nearly 2% in morning trading on the stock market today, below 77.Improved foreign-exchange rates were responsible for much of the upside, along with a 5-cent-a-share tax benefit in Q1. At the same time, the bottom line was hit by rising R&D expenses, including a $55 million milestone payment to biotech partner Incyte (INCY) upon the submission for approval of their jointly developed drug baricitinib.On the level of individual products, diabetes drug Humalog provided the biggest surprise, with its $606 million in Q1 sales falling 11% from the prior year and missing consensus by $100 million, according to Evercore ISI. Lilly said demand for the drug had actually increased, but so had rebates and discounts that Lilly negotiated with payers. Lilly said it does not expect the downtrend to continue the rest of the year.Revenue from a newer diabetes drug, Jardiance, doubled compared with last year, though since Lilly splits the take with partner Boehringer Ingelheim, it only received $38 million in Q1. U.S. sales beat expectations, and Lilly said it's taking more share of the growing SGLT2 class of diabetes drugs, perhaps accounting for the underperformance of Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) SGLT2 drug Invokana, as shown in J&J's Q1 report last week.Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez wrote that while there were various upsides and downsides to the report, ""we expect a limited impact as investor concerns about a significant Q1 miss diminish, and the focus shifts to abemaciclib data at ASCO (the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting in June) and the conclusion of Expedition 3 (trial of solanezumab in Alzheimer's disease) in Q4 2016,"" he wrote in his research note.
"
210,LLY,"Medical giant Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) beat Q1 estimates and raised guidance Tuesday morning, sending its stock to its fifth recent record high.J&J reported earnings of $1.68 a share, up 8% from the year-earlier quarter and beating analysts' consensus by 3 cents, according to Thomson Reuters. Sales rose 0.6% to $17.48 billion, matching consensus. J&J said that the foreign-exchange impact knocked 6.6 percentage points off sales growth.Nonetheless, the forex headwinds finally seem to be abating. J&J cited the improved forex outlook as the reason it was raising full-year sales guidance by $400 million, to $71.2 billion to $71.9 billion. It also added 10 cents to EPS guidance, now $6.53 to $6.68.IBD's Take: Johnson & Johnson rated No. 1 in its group, but CR is iffy.""Our Pharmaceuticals business continues to deliver impressive levels of growth, we have steady improvement in our Consumer business, and we are seeing momentum in our Medical Devices businesses, all of which are fueling our optimism for the full-year ahead,"" J&J CEO Alex Gorsky said in a statement.J&J stock was up 2% in early trading on the stock market today, touching a record high of 113.60 intraday. The stock is up more than 10% for the year so far, and it is the first of three medical stocks that are hitting new highs and are reporting this week, the others being Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) this evening and Stryker (SYK) late Wednesday.""This morning, J&J continued the growth momentum the company has seen in recent quarters, again delivering organic sales growth acceleration and its second consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth on an adjusted, operational basis,"" wrote Leerink analyst Danielle Antalffy in a research note.She noted that, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, M&A activity and shrinking sales of hepatitis C drug Olysio -- which was made obsolete when Gilead Sciences (GILD) released Harvoni in late 2014 -- sales rose 6.9%. Operating EPS growth was just above 10%.Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan wrote that the pharma sales beat was driven by the immunology franchise -- Remicade, Simponi and Stelara -- as well as its stroke prevention treatment Xarelto.But another top seller, diabetes drug Invokana, missed consensus by 19%. Investors had been wondering if Invokana would take a hit from Eli Lilly's (LLY) Jardiance, which last September proved that it could dramatically cut deaths from heart failure but didn't get a sales bump from this in Q4.
"
211,LLY,"Stocks struggled a bit and moved lower yesterday - while remaining in the range that I pointed out in yesterday's note....2080/2100 - Late morning we tested the 2080 level before finding some support and rally into the closing bell.... Trading was light as investors/traders appeared unwilling to commit to the market ahead of the onslaught of earnings today - think Apple (AAPL),  Facebook (FB),  Procter & Gamble (PG), EXXON Mobil (XOM), BAXTER (BAX), 3M (MMM), Freeport-McMoRan (FCX), Corning (GLW), Lockheed Martin (LMT), Eli Lilly (LLY) (Revenues beat, but EPS missed by 0.02 cts) & Whirlpool (WHR) (missed on the top line - revenues - and missed on the bottom line. reported $2.63 vs. exp of $2.68) that are all announcing today and ahead of tomorrow's FOMC announcement.Remember - today begins the two day FED meeting and there is a lot of anticipation and paralysis about what they will say tomorrow. Again - the mkt does not expect a change in rates at all...but it does expect some clarification in terminology concerning June and the next expected hike......Recall that the last hike in December, sent the mkts into a tailspin.....causing the FED to become a bit more 'dovish' as she searched for a reason to calm the mkts.....this time citing unstable global mkts as the culprit...but since then - the mkts have come roaring back - with the S&P now up 2.1% and the Dow up 3.74% - off of what looked like a disastrous year.....As a result of the strength - expect Janet to intimate a return to a path to higher rates......not necessarily faster, just a bit higher.....Expect every word to be parsed and every sentence to be deconstructed as everyone looks for the next 'clue'.Now why the low volumes? Well there are a number of reasons really - never mind the current regulatory environment, and the abuse suffered by so many managers during the 1Q - but yesterday - there was no 'news', right? No eco reports, no significant earnings, no speeches, no big international events, no nothing.....so why do anything? The mkt held in tight - giving no reason to deviate from the plan.....and so the only ones really playing yesterday were the HFT guys and - and asset managers that were tweaking core positions....but tweaking does not mean a change of investment strategy at all...it just means tweaking.....Now oil did come under a bit of pressure yesterday - falling by 2.4% to end the day at $$42.64- but all that tells me is that the recent run up in oil was a bit premature given the current glut and lack of a deal between the OPEC nations etc. So if oil trades within the current band - $39.50/$44 - it's all good.....Why should it break down or surge higher just yet? This morning we see oil up small as the dollar appears a bit weaker......(think no rate hike). Remember - we will get the weekly API (American Petroleum Institute) report this afternoon.Now yesterday we did get a broad measure of the housing mkt.....- but again - these stats are no longer the mkt moving events that they were......although - that could change...you see - yesterday was NEW HOME SALES....and typically this is good barometer of the state of the broader US economy...and guess what? Another disappointment.....New Home Sales FELL 1.5% vs. the exp of a rise of 1.6%.......and why should we be a bit concerned?Well - This is the time of the year when new home sales should be strong....so is this disappointment just another barometer of a weakening economic picture? What is really mind boggling is that we are now a decade into the housing collapse....a decade - that is 10 yrs of an incomplete recovery...as pockets of single family housing continue to stall..... New Home Sales on a total unit basis came in at 511k units - significantly below the 50 yr average of more than 650,000 units. During the Greenspan era - Subprime loans/mortgages propelled sales of New Homes into the stratosphere - sending them as high as 1.28 million units in 2005, - the yr before the beginning of the crash.......a crash created by the adjustable rate mortgages that managed to destroy so many people - triggering waves of foreclosures that then ignited the Great Financial Crisis of 2007 - 2010 (some say the crisis is still ongoing.....I'll leave that up to you...).US futures are up 2 pts in early trading...as the mkt gets ready to react to the slew of those earnings reports noted above. Whirlpool - which we noted missed the numbers is quoted down about $10 bucks in pre-mkt trading....quoted NOT trading just yet....so let's see what investors/traders think about that.....Today is also a big economic day...lots of macro data to consider....Durable Goods exp of +1.9%, ex trans of 0.5%, Cap Good Orders of +0.6%, Cap Goods Shipped of +0.9%, Markit US PMI of 52 and the Richmond Fed Survey of 12. The earnings will all be happening prior to the open while the macro data begins at 8:30 and goes until 10 am. This will create a lot of noise in early trading...but once it settles in after 11 am....then expect the discussion to revolve around the FED once analysts consider the implications of whatever today's macro data reveals.Again - I expect the broader mkt to hold tight within the 2080/2100 range until tomorrow. (Think FED paralysis). Individual names today will get rewarded or punished depending on what they reported and what they say about the future....All in a day's work.....Take Good Care

213,LLY,"Small biotech Alder BioPharmaceuticals (ALDR) soared more than 50% to a two-month high in early trading Monday after its migraine drug candidate succeeded in a mid-stage trial, positioning it to compete with some giant rivals.Alder said that a single intravenous infusion of its monoclonal antibody, ALD403, had significantly reduced migraine days over a 12-week period compared to a placebo. Depending on the dose, between 44% and 57% of patients experienced a 50% reduction in migraine days, while 27% to 33% experienced a 75% reduction.""Evaluation of ALD403 continues to exhibit a potential best-in-class profile, which includes immediate, significant and durable migraine prevention with infrequent quarterly dosing,"" Alder CEO Randall Schatzman said in a statement. ""With our commitment to the accelerated development of ALD403 reinforced by today's positive results, we look forward to advancing our development plan, and assuming FDA approval, independently marketing ALD403 in the U.S. to meet the critical medical needs of the 13 million patients nationwide who are candidates for migraine prevention therapy.""Alder's decision to market its drug without a big-pharma partner, unusual for a small biotech, could pit it against some very big competitors developing similar drugs. ALD403 is an anti-calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) antibody, similar to migraine candidates being developed by Amgen (AMGN), Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA) and Eli Lilly (LLY).Alder's drug is distinguished by its infrequent dosing: Amgen and Teva's drugs are injected once a month, while Lilly's is biweekly. It would also be competing against Allergan's (AGN) Botox, which is also quarterly but involves 31 separate shots.Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan wrote that ALD403's results seem roughly equivalent to Teva's in terms of effectiveness, but he did note that there was no significant improvement over the placebo in the number of patients who experienced a 100% reduction in migraine days. Between 4% and 8% of patients on the drug achieved this, which was rather lower than the 16% who had been headache-free in a previous trial.Alder stock, like so many other biotech stocks, had lost more than half its value since touching its all-time peak of 54.90 in July. But in early trading on the stock market today, shares were was up some 52% near 26.Image provided by Shutterstock.

214,LLY,"Big pharma Eli Lilly (LLY) changed its goals for a much-anticipated clinical trial of its Alzheimer's disease drug Tuesday, sending the stock down in a bad day overall for drug stocks.Lilly's phase-three trial of its drug solanezumab, called Expedition-3, had previously targeted two primary endpoints: a slowing of cognitive decline, and a slowing of functional decline. On Tuesday, Lilly said it was going to keep cognitive decline as the primary endpoint, but functional decline would become a key secondary endpoint.Lilly is expecting to report its first results from the trial late this year, and make a decision about filing for approval based on the outcome.""Emerging scientific evidence supports the idea that cognitive decline precedes and predicts functional decline in Alzheimer's disease, particularly in earlier stages of the disease,"" Lilly said by way of explanation in its press release.Lilly added that ""regulators globally will continue to view both cognitive and functional endpoints as necessary for clinical trials in people with mild Alzheimer's dementia, and regulatory guidance has been to include these as co-primary endpoints,"" so it's not clear how much difference this will make to the drug's approvability. Nonetheless, a trial that failed a co-primary endpoint would still be a failed trial.""Sounds like Lilly is doing everything they can to improve the success rate of Expedition-3,"" wrote Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum in an email to clients.Schoenebaum said Lilly told him the decision wasn't based on data from the trial itself, which the company hasn't yet seen. Lilly did analyze data from its earlier solanezumab studies Expedition-1 and Expedition-2, however, ""and other datasets in the field.""Schoenebaum added that the phase-three trial of a possible competitor from Biogen (BIIB), aducanumab, is using a different test that measures both cognitive and functional decline as its sole primary endpoint.Lilly stock hit a 52-week low of 69.60 on the stock market today, on a day when stocks in general and drug stocks in particular were taking a hit. By midday,  it was down 3.5% near 71. Biogen stock was down 2.5% near 250.

215,LLY,"Disgraced drugmaker Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) continued to sell off along with the rest of the medical sector Thursday as reports surfaced that creditors were demanding new terms as the company defaults on its massive debts.Reuters cited anonymous sources saying that in early talks, lenders were asking for higher interest payments and a pledge to pay a larger amount of the bank loans from the proceeds of any Valeant asset sales. Valeant has been in breach of its reporting covenant since Tuesday, when it missed its 10-K filing deadline, which it has 60 days to resolve. However, if it doesn't file by March 30, it will also be in default with its bank creditors and will have only 30 days to resolve the default.Valeant is about $30 billion in debt after a years-long buying spree, culminating in a failed attempt to buy Allergan (AGN) last year. Allergan subsequently merged with Actavis and is now in the process of being bought by Pfizer (PFE).By late afternoon on the stock market today, Valeant stock lost 11.5% to 29.69. Medical groups tracked by IBD, even those unrelated to drugs, accounted for the seven worst performing groups out of IBD's 197 industries. The generic drugs group led the slide with a 2.8% decline.The hardest-hit individual stocks were Valeant's fellow specialty drugmakers, some of whom have consciously followed Valeant's business model. Mallinckrodt (MNK) authorized a $350 million stock buyback but was down 4.1% to 53.42.  Endo International (ENDP), which is headed by former Valeant executive Rajiv De Silva, hit a three-year low of 27.62, trading down 11.4% to 30.03.Horizon Pharma (HZNP), which has been criticized for pricing policies much as Valeant has, was down 6.8% after selling off for the last three days.Among major drugmakers, Eli Lilly (LLY) tumbled 4.7%. Eli Lilly fell intraday to its lowest level since late 2014.

Let’s take a look at five medical-related stocks with notable charts: Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX), Eli Lilly (LLY), Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA), Inogen (INGN) and Ligand Pharmaceuticals (LGND).Valeant reported preliminary fourth-quarter earnings that missed expectations and slashed its guidance. The specialty drugmaker warned that it could potentially default if it doesn’t file its annual report by an April deadline. Valeant’s financials are under an ongoing review after a scandal broke out last fall.Shares plunged more than 51% to 33.51 in giant volume, hitting their lowest level in four years. The stock is now trading at 87% below its all-time high reached last August.Eli Lilly crumbled as much as 6% after announcing it’s changing the goal of the phase-three clinical trial for its Alzheimer’s treatment, signaling that the drug can only treat cognitive capabilities and not functional capabilities as well.The stock closed down 3.6% to 70.24. The move came in big turnover, and sent shares to a one-year low in intraday trade. Lilly is now 23% below its high reached in September.Teva Pharma’s $40.5 billion acquisition of Allergan’s generics unit has been delayed until June as it works to get regulators’ approval.Shares dropped more than 5% in intraday trade, and closed down 3.3%. Volume was heavy. Shares are now trading 14% below a consolidation buy point and 20% below their July high.Inogen reported better-than-expected quarterly results on Tuesday. The company makes oxygen tanks for chronic respiratory conditions.The gap-up sent shares as much as 22% higher, above their 200-day line in intraday trade. But the stock struggled to hold above that level and pared its gains to close up 17%. Inogen was able to retake the 50-day line in Monday’s session. It’s now about 26% below its September peak.Meanwhile, IBD 50 stock Ligand Pharma is working on a double-bottom base with a potential buy point at 106.08. Shares are currently trading about 8% below the pivot, losing 3.3% Tuesday.

218,LLY,"Small-cap biotech Axovant Sciences (AXON) could pull in $2 billion to $4 billion in sales on an Alzheimer's drug, RBC analyst Michael Yee said Tuesday — pitting it against big players like Gilead Sciences (GILD), Celgene (CELG), Biogen (BIIB) and Eli Lilly (LLY).Early Tuesday, Axovant reported Q3 losses and told investors that it expects to wrap up a key phase-three trial for its Alzheimer's drug intepirdine by year's end. Yee expects data by mid-2017.""We see 60% probability of success for phase 3 (intepirdine), on a $2 billion to $4 billion Alzheimer's drug, which could result in five to 10 times potential upside,"" Yee wrote in a research report. He has an outperform rating and 40 price target on Axovant stock.But Axovant stock toppled on the stock market today. Shares were down 7.2% to 11.15, at a five-month low, following the Q3 earnings report. Losses per share ex items widened to 43 cents from 12 cents in the year-earlier quarter. Analysts expected a 37-cent loss.Axovant made its initial public offering in June 2015, pricing shares at 15. The company hasn't yet reported sales.IBD'S TAKE: Biotech stocks are trading positively for the third consecutive day. Biogen could be among the leaders in that pack on early efficacy in a phase three trial of a spinal muscular atrophy drug in conjunction with Ionis. Get the full scope in Industry Themes.The Alzheimer's market is huge, with big players Gilead, Celgene, Biogen and Eli Lilly all looking to take a chunk. Axovant most closely rivals Danish drugmaker Lundbeck, which has two phase-three trials due in 2017 on its drug idalopirdine.Intepirdine and idalopirdine have similar mechanisms. Both are 5HT6 antagonists that aim to assist cognition and memory. But Lundbeck's idalopirdine has safety issues and Yee gives it only a 20% probability of success.Lundbeck's idalopirdine ""is using doses below the levels needed due to safety issues for that drug, and thus we would not overly read into it if it were negative,"" Yee wrote in a research report.Axovant is also testing nelotanserin to treat the ""visual hallucination"" symptom of Alzheimer's and Lewy body dementia. Data are expected in February from a phase two trial of 20 patients. But, Yee notes, the consensus has no expectation for that trial, considering the size.""If data were great (strong numerical reduction in hallucinations), we believe we could see a 20%-25% move for Axovant vs. minor downside if negative,"" he wrote, noting that Alzheimer's data later in the year is more important for the stock.RELATED:Eli Lilly Q3 Revenue, EPS Miss; CEO Praises Drug Pipeline

219,LLY,"Amgen (AMGN), Biogen (BIIB), Celgene (CELG) and Gilead Sciences (GILD) could look to M&A following Donald Trump's election as 2017 sets up with fewer regulatory hurdles and a likely biotech resurgence, RBC analyst Michael Yee said Monday.Biotech stocks have surged since Trump's election, largely on the notion that he will be less likely to pressure drug prices than Hillary Clinton and likely to push business-friendly legislation, including tax incentives to repatriate cash to the U.S.With the election uncertainty over, Yee expects the big four biotechs to make good on M&A plans as capital remains inexpensive and organic growth slows. Trump appears poised to embrace innovation within his administration, Yee wrote in a research report Monday.IBD'S TAKE: Biotechs aren't alone in experiencing a Trump effect. Defensive stocks are on a furious upswing following the election. Should you get in on these five defensive stocks now? Get IBD's Industry Themes for the answer.To that end, Trump met with Patrick Soon-Shiong over the weekend. Soon-Shiong is a biotech exec and the former CEO of Abraxis BioScience, which Celgene acquired in 2010 for $3 billion. There's no telling what will come of Trump's meeting with Soon-Shiong, Yee noted.Regardless, investors are starting to key in on the pro-biz environment. Since the election, shares of IBD's 421-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group and the SPDR S&P Biotech ETF (XBI) are nearly 15%. The iShares Nasdaq Biotech ETF (IBB) is up more than 9%.""Barring any big policy surprises out of Trump, there is an increased feeling of pro-business including pro-biotech within the GOP,"" Yee wrote. ""So we see it as unlikely that any major legislation should derail innovation.""Those increases are merely the beginning, Yee wrote, noting, ""If good things happen, we believe stocks can go much higher."" Alzheimer's data in late 2017 or early 2018 from Eli Lilly (LLY) could be a catalyst. Biotechs will also likely update 2017 guidance in January, potentially pushing stocks higher.No. 3 biotech Celgene is most de-risked in the postelection world, with no near-term catalysts and no ""fear of any big disappointments,"" Yee wrote. Celgene has multiple sclerosis data due in the first half of 2017, but likely won't raise 2020 guidance in January.But Celgene stock could dip on a dilutive deal, he noted.""We'd view any pullback as a buying opportunity because the long-term tail question is sufficient pipeline — and that's what long-term investors want to see (near-term earnings variance is less important than tail questions),"" he wrote.Meanwhile, Amgen and Biogen will likely ""be OK,"" but uncertainty remains on shares of BioMarin Pharmaceutical (BMRN) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), Yee wrote.Biogen stock could bound on strong Alzheimer's results from Eli Lilly. Amgen stock is still suffering the fallout of Q3 commentary on Enbrel pricing in 2017.On the stock market today, Celgene stock lifted 1.8% to 124.14. Shares of Amgen, Biogen and Gilead were all up a fraction. Vertex stock was down 0.4%, with BioMarin shares down 1.7% to 87.50.RELATED:Can This Small-Cap Biotech Take On Gilead, Celgene, Biogen In Alzheimer's?

220,LLY,"No. 2 drugmaker Pfizer's (PFE) sales and earnings are expected to diverge early Tuesday, as it issues its Q3 report amid potentially slowing sales of breast cancer drugs in the U.S., say prescription trackers IMS and Symphony.For Q3, the consensus of analysts polled by FactSet expects Pfizer to report $13.055 billion in sales, down 7% vs. the year-earlier quarter. But they see earnings per share ex items rising 17% to 62 cents.Evercore analyst John Scotti looks for more color on Pfizer's decision earlier this fall to forgo a long-rumored corporate breakup that would have split its innovative and established products businesses.IBD'S TAKE: Pfizer's mega-deal to buy Allergan went bust in April. Could AT&T's $85.4 billion takeover of Time Warner go the same direction?Investors will ""be looking for a better understanding of what exactly was the decisive factor that shifted management thinking toward continuing to operate Pfizer as a single company and what could change in the future to make the idea of a split attractive again,"" he wrote in a research note.Pfizer will also likely focus on Ibrance, its drug to battle ER-positive and HER2-negative breast cancer. The drug was granted accelerated approval in early 2015.Scotti expects Pfizer to comment on growing competition with Eli Lilly's (LLY) abemaciclib and Novartis' (NVS) ribociclib. Eli Lilly's drug has demonstrated positive results as a monotherapy -- a single drug to battle that disease -- but Novartis' had some safety concerns earlier this year.Wall Street is also likely to zero in on Pfizer commentary circling Prevnar, its pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. Prevnar added $6.2 billion in worldwide sales to Pfizer's top line in 2015, but its sales missed forecasts in Q2.""Previously, Pfizer commented they expect fiscal 2016 sales to be 'comparable to slightly below' 2015 levels, and do not expect Prevnar to be a growth driver in 2017 or 2018,"" Scotti wrote.Investors will likely have a keen eye on Pfizer's long-term growth expectations.In the stock market today, Pfizer stock fell 0.69% to 31.71, touching a six-month low. Pfizer stock has traded below its 50-day moving average, a key support line, for nearly three months.RELATED:Amgen, Gilead, Eli Lilly Eat Into AbbVie's Humira Sales: AnalystAriad Could Follow Gilead's — Or Mylan's — Route In Drug Price Battle

221,LLY,"Multiple sclerosis drug Tecfidera helped Biogen post a $50 million Q3 sales beat early Wednesday, and shares nudged up in early trading despite Biogen's (BIIB) abandonment of a lagging irritable bowel disorder drug.In the stock market today, Biogen stock lifted 3.7% to 296.46. Shares are still well below their 50-day moving average, however. Biogen stock is up 6% for 2016.For Q3, Biogen reported $2.96 billion in sales and $5.19 earnings per share ex items, up a respective 6% and 16% vs. the year-earlier quarter. Both metrics topped the consensus of 23 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters for $2.9 billion and $4.97.Tecfidera sales drove the lion's share of that beat, with $845 million in sales topping consensus expectations for $795 million, says Evercore analyst John Scotti. But a $40 million to $50 million inventory buildup in the U.S. vs. the prior quarter will likely roll off in Q4.IBD'S TAKE: IBD's 421-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group is ranked No. 19 out of 197 groups tracked. But trade has been volatile, as evidenced by movement in these key biotech ETFs. Follow IBD's ETFs & Funds section for more.Also, non-U.S. sales fell from the prior quarter on ""parallel trade dynamics,"" Biogen said.Overall, Tecfidera sales rose 10% vs. Q3 2015, Biogen said. The company said increased sales of treatments for Crohn's/multiple sclerosis, Hemophilia A/B and rheumatoid arthritis were partially offset by a worldwide decrease in interferon sales.During Q3, Biogen opted to end the development of MT-1303, an irritable bowel disorder drug it licensed last year from Mitsubishi Tanabe for $60 million plus milestone payments, Scotti said. MT-1303 was slated for phase 3 testing later this year.The drug ""had not gotten much credit yet from investors, so it will be interesting if this was simply commercial issues (they're behind others) or a safety or differentiation question,"" RBC analyst Michael Yee wrote in a research report.Biogen was ""encouraged"" by its investigation into Alzheimer's disease treatment, Aducanumab, Yee wrote. Positive data from Eli Lilly's (LLY) Solanezumab, a similar treatment, could tug up sentiment for Biogen, Yee has said.Yee kept his outperform rating and 286 price target on Biogen stock.Editor's Note: Corrects description of Biogen drug Tecfidera in first graph.RELATED:Eli Lilly, AbbVie Top 2017 Rankings; Pfizer, AstraZeneca Flailing

222,LLY,"Eli Lilly (LLY), Pfizer (PFE) and Gilead Sciences (GILD) are chipping away at AbbVie's (ABBV) Humira sales, Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan said Monday after AbbVie missed Q3 expectations Friday, primarily on declining Humira sales.Divan downgraded AbbVie stock to neutral and cut his price target to 60 from 70. He models immunosuppressant Humira pulling in $18.1 billion in 2018 sales, declining to $11.3 billion and $5.2 billion in 2022 and 2025, respectively.Humira accounted for 63% of AbbVie sales in Q3. The drug is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis and irritable bowel disorder — markets where branded rivals are already on the market and biosimilars are pressuring AbbVie's patent on Humira.AbbVie is working to protect that patent, but Divan expects Amgen (AMGN) and others to have biosimilars on the market by 2022.""Whether it is in 2020, 2021, 2022 or some other year, at some point Humira will start to decline,"" Divan wrote in his research report. To cope with Humira's decline (it missed Q3 expectations by $100 million), AbbVie has eight late-stage drugs capable of bringing in $25 billion to $30 billion in combined sales.IBD'S TAKE: AbbVie's earnings have grown an average 20% over the past five quarters, but have also declined for the last three periods. Get the full scoop in IBD's Income Investor.Pfizer, Eli Lilly/Incyte (INCY) and Gilead are all working on a class of drugs called JAK inhibitors that could compete in arthritis.Celgene (CELG), Novartis (NVS) and Eli Lilly have IL-17 and IL-23 inhibitors for psoriasis, and all three expected to become blockbuster drugs within five years of their launches.Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) already has a JAK inhibitor and is in the IL-23 field. AbbVie has its own IL-23 drug in development, but ""it will be entering into a crowded market where it will have more competitive and pricing challenges,"" said Divan.In the irritable bowel disorder market, Celgene's mongersen and ozanimod could put pressure on Humira sales as soon as 2020-22, Divan wrote.But UBS analyst Marc Goodman says the pressure on AbbVie stock is overdone. Shares touched a seven-month low Friday after AbbVie reported its Q3 earnings, which fell 6.2%. In the stock market today, AbbVie stock fell 3.2% to 55.78.Goodman kept his buy rating and 73 price target on AbbVie stock, though the company's 2017 earnings guidance for 13%-15% growth in 2017 implied $4.43-$5.53, which was lower than Wall Street's $5.62 view.Still, Goodman wrote that ""based on management's commentary on Humira volume and pricing, we think the concerns appear overdone. The earnings for next year are a little light, but we think the investment in the pipeline should drive growth in the longer term.""RELATED:Eli Lilly, AbbVie Top 2017 Rankings; Pfizer, AstraZeneca Flailing

223,LLY," Insulin pricing and animal companion trends wracked Eli Lilly (LLY), which early Tuesday posted Q3 sales and earnings well below Wall Street's expectations, prompting shares to plummet to a four-month low.But Eli Lilly stock rebounded on the stock market today, and rose a fraction, to77.75, Tuesday after earlier toppling as much as 2.6% to 75.50. Eli Lilly stock is down 7.6% for the year, but remains ahead of IBD's 44-company Ethical Drugs industry group, which is down 23%.Fellow drugmaker Merck (MRK) rose 2% Tuesday, after it posted a Q3 beat, but Novartis (NVS) fell 3.7% to a nearly seven-month low, after its Q3 sales missed Wall Street expectations.IBD'S TAKE: Some drugmakers aren't doing well, but some biotechs have shown signs of life of late. Find out more in IBD's Industry Snapshot, a good place to look for industry groups that are hot, or could heat up soon.Lilly credited sales growth in Q3 to an increased volume for several pharmaceutical products. But higher U.S. prices for erectile dysfunction drug Cialis and Forteo, used to treat osteoarthritis, were largely offset by lower realized prices for diabetes med Humalog, the company said.""After normalization for discounts and rebates, Humalog revenue growth would've been -1% vs. -14% (the pricing effect was -11%),"" Evercore analyst John Scotti wrote in a research report. ""Management claims that they have been seeing increased rebates across the board ... as well as seeing more business flowing through less profitable channels.""Q3 also saw worldwide animal health sales decline 9% vs. the year-earlier quarter to $706.2 million with the brunt felt in the U.S. where sales fell 14% to $338.6 million. Eli Lilly blamed wholesaler buying patterns for companion animal product and decreased sales for food animal products for the decline.Eli Lilly, meanwhile, reported $5.19 billion in sales and 88 cents earnings per share minus items, up 4.7% and down 1%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier quarter. Both metrics missed analyst views for $5.28 billion and 96 cents, as polled by Thomson Reuters.Solanezumab remained a bright spot for Eli Lilly which expects to have phase 3 trial data on the Alzheimer's treatment before year's end. RBC analyst Michael Yee sees a 40% chance of positive data for Solanezumab, and a 20%-25% chance success for Eli Lilly could drag up sentiment for rival companies such as Biogen (BIIB).""As a reminder, this (Eli Lilly's Alzheimer's drug) is the biggest swing factor in our view for turning investor sentiment and interest in biotech and biopharma equities,"" Yee wrote in a research report.Eli Lilly reaffirmed its 2016 guidance for $3.50 to $3.60 EPS ex items, which would be up 3.5%.""Our pipeline also continues to advance with a wide array of promising treatments for conditions from Alzheimer's disease to diabetes and cancer,"" Eli Lilly outgoing CEO John Lechleiter said in the company's earnings release.

251,LLY,"Biogen shares took a hit Wednesday when the big-cap biotech released ambiguous clinical-trial results for its Alzheimer's disease drug. Big pharma Eli Lilly reported stronger data for its own Alzheimer's candidate, but it remains unclear whether either of these drugs will make it to market.
"
252,LLY,"Biogen's (BIIB) aducanumab was the particular focus of attention. At the Alzheimer's Association International Conference (AAIC), the company reported the effects of aducanumab on patients with mild or prodromal (even earlier than mild) Alzheimer's after 54 weeks of treatment with a 6 mg dose. This rounded out the reportage of Biogen's phase one trial of aducanumab, which initially included 1 mg, 3 mg and 10 mg arms along with a placebo arm.
"
253,LLY,"After the patients in the lower doses showed little effect and the 10 mg group showed better results but worryingly high rates of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIAs) in their brain scans, Biogen added the 6 mg group in an attempt to split the difference.
"
254,LLY,"Thus, while the 54-week results for the other doses were reported back in March, Biogen had to wait until now for the 6 mg data to mature. In addition to the drug meeting the trial endpoints, analysts were hoping to see a correlation between efficacy and dose, which would be a strong indication that the results are due to the drug.
"
255,LLY,"Biogen stock fell 4.3% to 391.97 Wednesday. Eli Lilly (LLY) rallied from sharp early losses to close up 1% at 86.38.
"
256,LLY,"Both Biogen's and Lilly's drugs are based on the beta amyloid hypothesis, a theory that reducing the beta amyloid plaques seen in the brains of Alzheimer's sufferers will slow the disease's progress.
"
257,LLY,"""Consistent with previously reported results, the 54-week data from the 6 mg/kg (6 milligram dose per kilogram of body weight) arm demonstrated a statistically significant reduction of beta amyloid in the brain,"" Biogen said in its release. ""In exploratory analyses, the 6 mg/kg dose showed an improvement in the slowing of clinical decline, as measured by the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Clinical Dementia Rating sum of boxes (CDR-SB) scales, which was not statistically significant.
"
258,LLY,"""In a prespecified analysis across placebo and all doses of aducanumab, the slowing of clinical decline was shown to be dose-dependent, and this dose-dependence achieved statistical significance for both scales.""
"
259,LLY,"Small Study, Slow Disease
"
260,LLY,"The fact that the clinical benefit failed to reach statistical significance after a year isn't necessarily a deal breaker, according to RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee, given that this is a small study of a slow-acting disease. Biogen had announced it's taking aducanumab straight into phase three, with a giant 1,500-patient study.
"
261,LLY,"But Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum pointed out that the dose correlation wasn't perfect.
"
262,LLY,"He emailed to clients: ""On MMSE, the 12-month 6 mg data have improved when compared to the six-month data. (Six months looked exactly like placebo; there's now some separation.) However, the 6 mg data is still worse than the 3 mg data, which casts some doubt on the dose response.
"
263,LLY,"""Also, as we think was generally expected, the placebo data changed, which had the effect of slightly shrinking the magnitude of the benefit vs. prior data. However, the benefit still looks robust to us.""
"
264,LLY,"Another Unpleasantry

"
276,LLY,"""Therefore, we view today's data as incrementally positive, but not thesis- or stock-changing.""Biogen shares took a hit Wednesday when the big-cap biotech released ambiguous clinical-trial results for its Alzheimer's disease drug. Big pharma Eli Lilly reported stronger data for its own Alzheimer's candidate, but it remains unclear whether either of these drugs will make it to market.Biogen's (BIIB) aducanumab was the particular focus of attention. At the Alzheimer's Association International Conference (AAIC), the company reported the effects of aducanumab on patients with mild or prodromal (even earlier than mild) Alzheimer's after 54 weeks of treatment with a 6 mg dose. This rounded out the reportage of Biogen's phase one trial of aducanumab, which initially included 1 mg, 3 mg and 10 mg arms along with a placebo arm.After the patients in the lower doses showed little effect and the 10 mg group showed better results but worryingly high rates of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIAs) in their brain scans, Biogen added the 6 mg group in an attempt to split the difference.Thus, while the 54-week results for the other doses were reported back in March, Biogen had to wait until now for the 6 mg data to mature. In addition to the drug meeting the trial endpoints, analysts were hoping to see a correlation between efficacy and dose, which would be a strong indication that the results are due to the drug.Biogen stock fell 4.3% to 391.97 Wednesday. Eli Lilly (LLY) rallied from sharp early losses to close up 1% at 86.38.Both Biogen's and Lilly's drugs are based on the beta amyloid hypothesis, a theory that reducing the beta amyloid plaques seen in the brains of Alzheimer's sufferers will slow the disease's progress.""Consistent with previously reported results, the 54-week data from the 6 mg/kg (6 milligram dose per kilogram of body weight) arm demonstrated a statistically significant reduction of beta amyloid in the brain,"" Biogen said in its release. ""In exploratory analyses, the 6 mg/kg dose showed an improvement in the slowing of clinical decline, as measured by the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Clinical Dementia Rating sum of boxes (CDR-SB) scales, which was not statistically significant.""In a prespecified analysis across placebo and all doses of aducanumab, the slowing of clinical decline was shown to be dose-dependent, and this dose-dependence achieved statistical significance for both scales.""Small Study, Slow DiseaseThe fact that the clinical benefit failed to reach statistical significance after a year isn't necessarily a deal breaker, according to RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee, given that this is a small study of a slow-acting disease. Biogen had announced it's taking aducanumab straight into phase three, with a giant 1,500-patient study.But Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum pointed out that the dose correlation wasn't perfect.He emailed to clients: ""On MMSE, the 12-month 6 mg data have improved when compared to the six-month data. (Six months looked exactly like placebo; there's now some separation.) However, the 6 mg data is still worse than the 3 mg data, which casts some doubt on the dose response.""Also, as we think was generally expected, the placebo data changed, which had the effect of slightly shrinking the magnitude of the benefit vs. prior data. However, the benefit still looks robust to us.""Another UnpleasantryAnother unpleasant surprise had to do with the rate of ARIAs. Previous research showed a higher rate of ARIAs among patients carrying the ApoE4 protein, so Biogen analyzed carriers and noncarriers. Again, the rate of ARIAs among ApoE4 carriers was right in between the 3 mg and 10 mg groups (10%).

277,LLY,"Large-cap drugmakers Valeant Pharmaceuticals, Eli Lilly and Bristol-Myers Squibb all beat analysts' Q2 estimates, but their stocks went in different directions, as their guidance was more mixed.Valeant (VRX) rose more than 6% after it said total revenue rose 34% to $2.73 billion, easily topping consensus views for $2.54 billion. The company's organic growth, not including acquisitions, was 19% during the quarter. U.S. growth owed to Valeant's dermatology, contact lens and dental businesses. The company also reported notable growth in China, the Middle East and Russia.Valeant's adjusted earnings, reported as cash earnings minus currency impact and its Salix Pharmaceuticals takeover, were $2.73, up 43% vs. Q2 2014 and well above consensus views for $2.46.For Q3, Valeant guided its cash earnings to $2.60 and $2.70 per share, below the Thomson Reuters consensus view for $2.87. It put revenue at $2.6 billion to $2.8 billion vs. consensus of $2.75 billion.In addition, executives lifted the full-year earnings forecast to $11.50 to $11.80 vs. prior guidance of $10.90 to $11.20. They steered full-year revenue expectations to a range of $10.7 billion to $11.1 billion. Original revenue guidance was $10.4 billion to $10.6 billion.""Same-store organic growth of 19% is impressive; we expected roughly 14%,"" wrote BMO Capital Markets analyst Alex Arfaei in a research note. ""This was driven by U.S. organic growth of 32%... . We don't see this business slowing down any time soon, and Salix is adding momentum in the U.S.""Morningstar analyst Michael Waterhouse praised the $800 million pending acquisition of Egypt's largest drugmaker, Amoun Pharmaceutical, announced last week.""The strength and diversification of Valeant's product portfolio continue to support the company's narrow economic moat,"" Waterhouse wrote in a note. ""The recent Amoun acquisition, for example, not only nearly doubles Valeant's Middle East and Africa operations with a strong manufacturing and salesforce foundation in the region, but also provides likely opportunities for revenue synergies as the company shifts its portfolio into the region, helping to boost economies of scale.""Lilly Guidance Hike MutedLilly's (LLY) profit, excluding one-time items, rose 22% over the year-earlier quarter to 90 cents a share, beating consensus by 16 cents, according to Thomson Reuters. Revenue rose 1% to $4.98 billion. Analysts had expected a slight decline.Despite the 16-cent beat, Lilly added just 10 cents to its full-year EPS guidance, now $3.20 to $3.30. It also lifted the low end of its revenue guidance range, now $19.7 billion to $20 billion. That would make revenue essentially the same as last year, but represent at least a 13% profit increase.Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum said in an email that the recently off-patent blockbusters Zyprexa and Cymbalta had held up better in the face of generic competition than Wall Street had expected, while new drug launches also were going well. The only weak point was diabetes drug Humalog, which missed expectations and shrank overall vs. a year ago.Gross profit margins were slightly higher than expected on lower taxes and sales, general & administrative spending.Lilly stock rose a fraction.Bristol-Myers' (BMY) Q2 earnings climbed 10% over last year's Q2 to 53 cents a share, topping consensus by 17 cents. Sales gained 7% to $4.2 billion, more than $450 million above the Street's number.Bristol-Myers added 10 cents to its full-year EPS range, now $1.70 to $1.80. It expects revenue of $15.5 billion to $15.9 billion, above analysts' average estimate of $15.4 billion.The hepatitis C franchise beat consensus by a huge margin — $479 million vs. analysts' $263 million — but the firm said it benefited from the one-time recognition of $170 million in deferred revenue in France.Probably the most-watched single drug in Bristol-Myers' portfolio was cancer drug Opdivo, just in its second full quarter of sales, which at $122 million beat consensus by about $5 million.Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez wrote that since the hepatitis C sales likely aren't sustainable, Opdivo's ramp-up is especially important.""Overall, we like what we see in the quarter, and our expectations for accelerating Opdivo uptake with a broad approved label for second-line non-squamous NSCLC (non-small-cell lung cancer) continue to be robust,"" he wrote in a research note.Bristol's stock fell 1.6%.Alan Elliott contributed to this story.

279,LLY,"A drug candidate that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Sanofi (SNY) jointly developed has beaten AbbVie's (ABBV) best-selling rheumatoid-arthritis (RA) drug in a late-stage study, the companies said Friday.Regeneron and Sanofi said that their monoclonal antibody sarilumab met the trial's main goal of improving symptoms after 24 weeks of a biweekly dosing regimen. Some 72% of patients on sarilumab achieved at least a 20% improvement in signs and symptoms based on American College of Rheumatology criteria, in contrast to 58% of the patients in the Humira group. Both groups experienced about the same rate of negative side effects, though the sarilumab group showed a higher rate of neutropenia, or lowering of white blood cells.Humira is currently the top-selling RA drug and, indeed, the top-selling drug of any kind in the world today, but its number of competitors is rising. Last fall baricitinib, a drug that Eli Lilly (LLY) and Incyte (INCY) co-developed, also beat Humira in a head-to-head trial; unlike the injectable Humira and sarilumab, it is delivered orally. Roche's (RHHBY) intravenous medicine Actemra has also bested Humira in trials.Regeneron and Sanofi have already applied for FDA approval of sarilumab based on earlier data, with a decision due by Oct. 30.RBC Capital Markets analyst Adnan Butt called the news a ""modest positive"" but added that investors are still concerned with some nearer-term issues with Regeneron's stock. Among them is a pilot program to test changes in Medicare Part B, announced this week, that could affect a great deal of the reimbursement for Regeneron's flagship drug Eylea, and a patent lawsuit that Amgen (AMGN) filed over another monoclonal antibody in the Regeneron/Sanofi partnership, Praluent.""All else being equal, beating Humira is certainly better than not beating it, but at least some of the discussed overhangs may need clearing before the pipeline receives more credit,"" wrote Butt in a research note.By late morning on the stock market today, AbbVie stock was up almost 3% near 58. Sanofi was up 2% near 41, while Regeneron stock was up a fraction near 381.

280,LLY,"Shares of diabetes giant Novo Nordisk (NVO) jumped Friday after the company said its drug Victoza reduced heart attacks and strokes.Novo released few details about the results of the study, which it's saving for the next American Diabetes Association meeting in June. However, it did say that there was a statistically significant reduction in all three of its metrics -- heart attack, stroke and death from all cardiovascular causes -- among the 9,000 patients taking the diabetes drug over five years, compared to the placebo group. The subjects were all over age 50 and either had cardiovascular disease or multiple risk factors.Novo Nordisk's stock was up about 8% in afternoon trading on the stock market today, near 57. It's the highest-rated stock in the low-rated Medical-Ethical Drugs group, with a Composite Rating of 82.The effect of diabetes drugs on cardiovascular health has been the subject of several studies lately, notably from Eli Lilly (LLY), whose drug Jardiance reduced deaths from heart failure by 32% in a similar large, long-term study reported last September. On the other hand, Merck's (MRK) Januvia showed no effect either good or bad in its outcomes trial reported a few months earlier.A similarly neutral result was reported for an outcomes trial of the Sanofi (SNY) drug lixisenatide, which is noteworthy because lixisenatide is in the same class as Victoza. Both are glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogs, similar to Bydureon from AstraZeneca (AZN) and Lilly's Trulicity, while Jardiance is an sglt2 inhibitor, in the same class as Invokana from Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Farxiga from AstraZeneca. Merck's Januvia belongs to another class, called DPP-4 inhibitors.On a conference call with analysts Friday, Novo's Chief Scientific Officer Mads Thomsen said that the different results may have come from subtle differences between the drugs, which he thinks extend to Victoza's planned successor, semaglutide.""It's not only the question of being a member of the given class of GLP-1 agonist,"" said Thomsen. ""It's also a part of the kinetics, dynamics, distribution, half-life, and so on. And as we got semaglutide, we have done rather detailed investigations. . . . There is nothing from the animal pharmacology to negate the notion that semaglutide should do at least as well on cardiovascular performance.""
"
281,LLY,"During the drug-stock boom, the newer biotech companies tended to get the most play as growth stocks. But last year, one of the top-performing large-cap drugmakers was none other than 140-year-old Eli Lilly.Like other big pharmas, Lilly (LLY) has spent the last few years climbing out of an earnings trough brought on by the loss of patent protection on some of its biggest drugs. While growth is still slow, investors have gotten ever more interested in the company's pipeline:Lilly's late-stage drug candidate solanezumab could bring a breakthrough in a currently untreatable disease -- Alzheimer's.Psoriasis treatment ixekizumab is expected to launch anytime now and eventually achieve blockbuster sales. Another immunology drug, baricitinib, which Lilly co-developed with Incyte (INCY), was also recently filed with the FDA.Meanwhile, the already marketed diabetes drug Jardiance shocked Wall Street last year by reducing deaths from heart failure by 32% in a large-scale study called Empa-Reg.Recently, Lilly CEO John Lechleiter sat down with IBD to explain Lilly's strategy for 2016 and beyond.IBD: I'm interested in your immunology strategy. Given that there are a lot of medicines out there in that area, how do you see yourself fitting into the space?Lechleiter: Well, I think the only way we can enter that space -- and lay claim to any of these disease areas -- is to offer something better. And I believe the data we have on ixekizumab, which is our anti-IL17 antibody for psoriasis, is excellent. You look at clearance rates: 31% to 41% of people across three studies had 100% clearance of their plaque. So while there are competitors there, we feel very good about the profile of that product.I think with baricitinib, in four studies we established, in one of them superiority to methotrexate, which is the current first-line standard of care; and in another study, superiority in terms of signs and symptoms of RA (rheumatoid arthritis) to (AbbVie's (ABBV)) Humira, which is the biggest drug in the world.I think we’re bringing something new to these categories. In the case of RA, we know people cycle between different courses of therapy, and I think there’s no question, even with the drugs we have in that space today, there’s still an unmet need.IBD: In the diabetes area, you have this impressive data from Jardiance, and people are wondering is this going to be a class effect? If it is, do you have a point of differentiation?Lechleiter: Well, I think first of all, the people (who are) asking if it’s a class effect (meaning the entire class of drugs would all perform the same) are the people who don’t have Jardiance. The fact is, we have the data. Anything else about any of the other ones is speculation. So I think the advantage we have is first-mover advantage. Obviously, as soon as we get the label changed, we will exercise that. We filed that with the FDA ... (and) expect to get updated labeling reflecting the outcome of Empa-Reg later this year.IBD: The overall diabetes market has been under pressure lately. Sanofi (SNY) and Novo Nordisk (NVO) have been warning of slower growth. Is this true of the market in general or just certain segments?Lechleiter: I think that several categories are still growing in the diabetes space. It’s very competitive. Each of these drug categories has three or four different players. We happen to be the only company that has a complete spectrum across the treatment paradigm, along with Boehringer Ingelheim.The growth of insulins is slowing a bit, because we believe that more and more people using insulin are using an sglt2 inhibitor like Jardiance that are lowering insulin requirements. So I think there’s some interplay between the drugs. But we also know that SGLT2 category growth is coming at the expense, in many cases, of generic sulfonylureas. So that brand category is expanding.I think from a market standpoint, there’s a lot of competition. That’s great for consumers (and) great for physicians. But it remains for us to differentiate our products and to compete in that mix.IBD: Building the complete portfolio of diabetes medicines -- what is the advantage of that? Is it a marketing advantage?Lechleiter: Well, at a fundamental level, we can work with physicians to address, “What’s the right drug for a given patient?” vs. “How do you fit the patient into our drug?” if that makes sense. Let’s understand, diabetes is a progressive disease. So understanding where the patient is in that journey, and how our medicines can best help the patient. We can be agnostic about what choice a physician makes, because we have an offering at every step of the way.Ultimately, we can also, hopefully, better understand what the right combinations are. We have a fixed-dose combination of a DPP4 along with Jardiance -- we’re the only company that offers that today. We have not just orals, we have insulins. We have not just insulins, but our GLP-1 drug Trulicity. So I think there’s some advantages in terms of being able to optimize treatment. And ultimately there may be some marketplace advantages to having a full basket of products -- if you think about negotiating with payers and insurers, for example.IBD: In Alzheimer’s, you have different programs going. Do you anticipate there will be multiple drugs in this category?Lechleiter: First of all, if solanezumab is positive -- we’ll know by the end of the year -- that’s going to generate a tremendous amount of interest in companies developing BACE inhibitors, antibodies and other drugs. We believe that ultimately this will probably be treated with a combination, not unlike the way diabetes is treated today, not unlike the way cancer is treated. It may be an antibody with an oral BACE inhibitor, for example. But we’re also developing agents that act against tau (protein), which is a downstream aspect of the disease progression.It remains to be seen, but our best guess is that it will be a combination. If (solanezumab) is successful, others will follow, and we aim to be in that group.IBD: In oncology, again I’m thinking about your positioning -- there's been lot of drug industry activity in cancer. Can you talk about your strategy?Lechleiter: The pillar of our oncology business, going back eight or nine years ago, was Alimta, and it still is today. We bought ImClone in October of 2008. We’ve had two drugs approved from that ImClone pipeine: Cyramza, which now has four indications -- two gastric cancers, colorectal cancer and lung cancer -- and then late last year we got approval for Portrazza, and that’s indicated for squamous-cell non-small-cell lung cancer. And that’s a type of lung cancer that, in the first line, has not seen an improvement in survival for 20 years. So we’re excited about that.We have a third ImClone product that we’ve commenced filing with the FDA, called olaratumab. That is for soft-tissue sarcoma. Behind that we have three drugs in the clinic today that have immune-system components associated with them, as we begin to build an immuno-oncology portfolio. We also have a drug that I think everyone is excited about called abemaciclib. That’s a CDK4/6 inhibitor. We’ll have the phase-two data for breast cancer this year. We also have a phase-three (trial) underway. We also have a phase-three underway for our CDK4/6 inhibitor in lung cancer.So we’re focused on immuno-oncology, microenvironment -- which would be Cyramza, in other words anti-angiogenesis drugs -- and cell cycle inhibitors. So it’s a three-pronged approach, and I think we’ve got a good portfolio of products in the pipeline to address all three.

285,LLY,"Merck (MRK) stock popped Tuesday after the drugmaker posted Q3 earnings that topped Wall Street's expectations, a day after U.S. regulators approved two new Biologics License Applications for its Keytruda lung cancer treatment.But $356 million in worldwide Keytruda sales missed the $386 million expectation of health care tracker Symphony Health Services Consulting, Evercore analyst John Scotti wrote in a research report. U.S. Keytruda sales of $188 million lagged Symphony's model by 10%, he said.In the stock market today, Merck stock rose 2% to 61.95 after falling intraday to 59.55. Shares are up 17% for the year, though IBD's 44-company Medical-Ethical Drugs group is down 23% in 2016.For Q3, Merck reported $10.5 billion in sales, up 4.6% vs. the year-earlier quarter, and $1.07 earnings per share ex items, up 11.5% year over year. Both metrics topped the consensus of 22 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters for $10.2 billion and 99 cents.Merck credited the sales beat to franchises Gardasil and Proquad, vaccines against human papillomavirus (HPV) and measles, mumps, rubella and varicella (chickenpox), respectively. But, Scotti noted, the transition to a two-dose Gardasil regimen will hurt Merck in 2017.The company ""declined to give specific expectations, but did say that they expected revenue declines,"" he wrote.Gardasil sales came in at $860 million in Q3, up 38% year over year, while Proquad sales rose 27% to $496 million. Keytruda led growth for Merck in Q3, pulling in $356 million, up 124%. Diabetes med Januvia/Janumet brought in nearly $1.55 billion in sales, comprising 15% of total quarterly revenue.Merck also updated its fiscal 2016 EPS minus items view to $3.71 to $3.78, which would be up 4.3% on a year-over-year basis. That's in line with analysts' broader views for $3.75.IBD'S TAKE: While IBD's Ethical Drugs group ranks a lowly No. 163, out of 197 groups, the Biomed/Biotech group is No. 17 and has shown some life, as you could have learned from a recent Industry Snapshot. The feature helps investors identify potentially hot industry groups.Meanwhile, drugmakers Eli Lilly (LLY) and Novartis (NVS) both posted Q3 sales misses. Lilly stock rose a fraction, but Novartis stock fell 3.7%.As for Merck, its Q3 results followed a decision Monday from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration allowing two supplemental Biologics License Applications for Keytruda, Merck's lung cancer drug. The drug competes with Bristol-Myers Squibb's (BMY) Opdivo.Keytruda can now be used as a first-line treatment for patients with metastatic nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have a high expression of the PD-L1 receptor. Regulators allowed Merck to include data showing Keytruda improved survival vs. chemotherapy in patients with previously-treated NSCLC with a high expression of the PD-L1 receptor.RELATED:Merck Topples Bristol-Myers On Lung Cancer WinNovartis Tumbles On Q3 Sales Miss; Chemo Sales May Boost IncyteEli Lilly Q3 Revenue, EPS Miss; CEO Praises Drug Pipeline

286,LLY,"Novartis (NVS) stock tumbled to a six-month low Tuesday after the firm's Q3 sales missed views, but double-digit growth in chemotherapy sales could buoy ex-partner Incyte (INCY), said RBC analyst Simos Simeonidis.In the stock market today, however, both Novartis and Incyte stocks toppled, with shares of Incyte testing their 50-day moving average. Novartis stock fell 3.7% to 72.63, with Incyte stock dipped 1.1% to 87.20.For Q3, Novartis reported $12.13 billion in sales and $1.23 earnings per share ex items, down 1% and 3%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier quarter. Sales missed the consensus of six analysts polled by Thomson Reuters for $12.23 billion. EPS topped by 4 cents.But sales of chemotherapy drug Jakavi/Jakafi, used to treat myelofibrosis, MF, and polycythemia vera, PV, grew 45% year over year to $149 million, topping consensus views for $147 million, Simeonidis wrote in a research report.IBD'S TAKE: The biotech sector has been slogged recently, but double-digit gains last month from Kite Pharma and G.W. Pharmaceuticals could breathe some life back into the sector. Get a closer look using the Industry Snapshot.Incyte acquired the rights to develop and commercialize Jakafi for graft-vs.-host disease from Eli Lilly (LLY) in April. Lilly also amended its agreement with Novartis to allow Novartis the right to do so outside the U.S. in exchange for royalty payments.Simeonidis estimates Incyte will pull in $28.4 million in Q3 royalties from Novartis, up 57% vs. the year-earlier quarter. That missed Simeonidis' earlier view for $29.1 million and the consensus model for $29.7 million.""According to Novartis, the increased revenue came from patient gains in MF globally and the launch of PV in key markets,"" he wrote. Inctye's actual royalties likely will be reported Nov. 1 within Inctye's Q3 earnings release.As for Novartis, the firm reiterated his full-year guidance, and expects 2016 sales to be in line with last year's at $49.4 billion.RELATED:Merck Crushes Q3 Expectations Following Lung Cancer Drug WinEli Lilly Q3 Revenue, EPS Miss; CEO Praises Drug Pipeline

287,LLY,"Biogen (BIIB) could add another $1 billion in 2017 sales if its myotonic dystrophy drug in partnership with Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS) garners strong phase 1 and 2 data by year's end, says RBC analyst Michael Yee.Yee boosted his price target on Biogen stock to 375 from 300, and kept his outperform rating. The previous 300 price target was undervalued with potential catalysts like M&A, a boost from Eli Lilly's (LLY) Alzheimer's drug and a growing pipeline, he wrote in a research report.In the stock market today, Biogen stock edged up a small fraction, to 290.78, and remains below its 50-day line. Shares are down 5% for the year, but that's still better than IBD's 421-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group, which has fallen 22%.Wall Street is undervaluing Biogen and Ionis' DMKP (dystrophia myotonica protein kinsae) drug, Yee says. He expects positive data, including a good safety profile, by year's end. Also, the testing includes biopsies examining biomarkers.""We could see key mutated DMPK gene 'knockdown' as proof of concept that the drug is already working and getting rid of the bad species causing the disease,"" he wrote. This ""suggests efficacy happening already and likely for this drug.""IBD'S TAKE: Biogen belongs to the BioShares Biotechnology Products exchange-traded fund, which is down 1.4% year to date amid the volatile election season. Check out IBD's ETFs tracker to keep an eye on potential highflying funds.Biogen's six-year CEO George Scangos announced in July he would leave as soon as a new CEO was named, but as long as that doesn't happen, Yee sees a 30% chance that Biogen could be acquired. He also sees a 30%-50% chance Eli Lilly will have success with its Alzheimer's drug, Solanezumab. Eli Lilly's success would tug up Biogen, which is developing Aducanumab to remove the plaque deposits associated with Alzheimer's.The DMKP market is likely bigger than the SMA (spinal muscular atrophy) and Duchenne muscular dystrophy markets, Yee says.There are two classes of DMKP, the more severe class (DM1) is five times bigger than the DMD patient population, he says.Biogen and Ionis' drug is being tested in patients receiving eight shots over six weeks, and patients receiving 12 shots over 14 weeks. Preclinical trials have shows a 50% knockdown of the mutated DMKP gene can produce significantly improved muscular function, Yee wrote.""We think dose-dependent knockdown with clean safety and improved biomarkers and muscle function could lead to new derisking given DMPK is specifically the toxic accumulated protein preventing production of key proteins needed for muscle function,"" he wrote.RELATEDCelgene Pitted Against Gilead, Biogen In Crohn's Drug BattleCan These Top 5 Biotechs Climb Q3 'Wall Of Worry'?

288,LLY,"Eli Lilly's (LLY) Alzheimer's drug Solanezumab could add $7.5 billion in peak sales and ""supercharge"" earnings, Goldman Sachs analyst Jami Rubin said Tuesday as she upgraded the stock on expectations of long-term sales acceleration.Rubin noted Lilly is highly diversified and not dependent on Solanezumab, an antibody that could act as a neuroprotector for patients with Alzheimer's disease. Without Sola, she sees $12.5 billion in new product sales, representing nearly half of total sales, by 2020.Over the next four years, Eli Lilly plans to launch drugs combating symptoms associated with rheumatoid arthritis, plaque psoriasis and diabetes. Rubin ascribes a 35% success probability to Sola, up from 25% previously.""But even without Sola, Lilly Eli can grow earnings by double digits over the next five years and by high single digits out to 2025, as it has one of the most durable franchises in the industry,"" she wrote in a research report.Rubin upgraded Eli Lilly stock to a buy from neutral and boosted her price target to 95 from 89.Lilly stock is down 6% for the year but is outpacing a 20% decline in IBD's 44-company Medical-Ethical Drugs industry group. The group is ranked No. 114 out of 197 groups tracked, down from No. 83 last week.On the stock market today, Eli Lily lifted 1.7%, to 80.88, retaking its 50-day line after undercutting that support area on Monday.IBD'S TAKE: Biotech stocks have heated recently on M&A speculation amid Big Pharma players.

332,LLY,"2015 was a year with two distinct parts for drug stocks: The first seven months continued the bull run of the last four years, while the sudden resurfacing of the drug-pricing debate led to a rocky five months after that.But overall, the group came out ahead — and these top-performing big caps show that a solid story can make up for political worries in the eyes of investors.•Incyte (INCY) is up 49% — as of Wednesday's close — after a year of steady gains for its lone marketed product, Jakafi, as well as its pipeline of potential blockbusters. In March, Jakafi won EU approval in the blood cancer polycythemia vera, for which it is already approved in the U.S., along with another blood cancer, myelofibrosis. Both those diseases are rare, but Incyte is shooting for much bigger markets with its late-stage candidates baricitinib and epacadostat.Baricitinib, which Incyte is developing in partnership with Eli Lilly (LLY), tested successfully in phase-three trials in rheumatoid arthritis against a placebo, methotrexate and the current market leader, AbbVie 's (ABBV) Humira. In his Nov. 18 initiation report on Incyte, Goldman Sachs analyst Salveen Richter estimated peak annual sales of more than $2 billion after an expected 2017 launch.Richter added that a more important future driver of shares will likely be Incyte's entries into the budding field of immuno-oncology. Incyte has been testing its lead candidate in the field, epacadostat, in combination with Merck's (MRK) Keytruda in a variety of cancers. In early November, Incyte's stock fell after a small study of the combo in patients with advanced cancers disappointed Wall Street, but Richter wrote that 2016 will likely bring more clarity as more results come out.Incyte has been operating at a loss due to all this research spending, but analysts expect it to turn its first annual profit next year. The stock's current IBD Composite Rating is 60.•Danish diabetes giant Novo Nordisk (NVO) is up 39% as it ends the year with a flat base following early gains. In March, the stock rose sharply after Novo said it would refile for U.S. approval of its long-acting insulin analogue Tresiba, along with its shorter-acting sister drug Ryzodeg. The two drugs suffered a surprise rejection in 2013 as the FDA sought more data on their possible risks to the heart. This time around, the agency was convinced, and it approved them on Sept. 25.Also boosting the stock early in the year was Novo's February release of positive clinical-trial data on its latest glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, OG217SC. Novo has been selling its earlier GLP-1 agonist Victoza since 2010, but the market has gotten more competitive in the last couple years with new GLP-1s launching from Sanofi (SNY), GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and Eli Lilly. Those drugs are all injectable, however, while Novo's new candidate is oral. Novo announced further positive results for the drug in July and September.Novo's financial results in U.S. currency suffered from the foreign-exchange headwinds that hit all global drugmakers this year, but it still managed a solid IBD EPS Rank of 85 and a Relative Strength rating of 87.•Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) continued its multiyear run on the stock market, hitting a lifetime high of 605.93 on Aug. 4 before getting caught in the larger biotech sell-off. It's still up 34% for the year.Regeneron's flagship eye drug Eylea continued to perform well, aided by a new approval for diabetic retinopathy in March. But drawing more attention was the launch of its cholesterol drug Praluent in July.Praluent was not only the first of a new class of cholesterol drugs — though it was followed shortly to the market by Amgen 's (AMGN) Repatha — it's also the first of a number of novel monoclonal antibodies that Regeneron has been developing in a partnership with Sanofi. The next entry, dupilumab, is in late-stage testing for asthma and eczema and is also expected to attain multibillion-dollar annual sales.Regeneron is also the highest-rated stock on this list, with the highest-possible Composite Rating of 99.• Eli Lilly is the top-performing traditional big pharma of the year, with a 25% gain. While its sales growth has been flat due to its aging drugs, as well as currency headwinds, the company has improved profit margins through cost controls and gotten a lot of investors excited about its pipeline. As noted above, its partnership with Incyte has borne fruit in the baricitinib trials. Lilly doesn't have much of a presence in rheumatoid arthritis or other immunology diseases, but Lilly is planning to change that not only with baricitinib but with ixekizumab, a psoriasis treatment it's planning to launch next year that is expected to sell in the billions eventually.Lilly's already-launched diabetes drug Jardiance yielded one of pharma's biggest upside surprises this year, when a giant study of its effects on cardiovascular health showed that it reduced death from heart failure by 32%. That drove the stock to a 14-year high of 92.85 in September, which turned into a cup-with-handle base.The stock holds a 72 CR.• Baxalta (BXLT) is up 23% since it started trading July 1 in a spin-off from Baxter International (BAX), which sought to unlock the shareholder value of its biopharma arm. Just 10 days later, the company received an unsolicited $30 billion buyout offer from British drugmaker Shire (SHPG), which saw Baxalta's hemophilia franchise as an ideal addition to its rare-disease portfolio.Baxalta rejected the offer, but the situation remains unresolved. Last week, rumors were buzzing that Shire would up its bid, though it hasn't yet. Baxalta's financials have been slow and steady, leading to an EPS Rank of 62, but the acquisition hopes have lifted the stock's RS Rating to 94.

373,LLY,"Big pharmas Merck (MRK), Eli Lilly (LLY) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) were trading up Tuesday after getting upgrades from Barclays, while AbbVie (ABBV) seesawed on a downgrade.Analyst Geoff Meacham assumed coverage of a newly combined U.S. Pharmaceuticals sector in Barclays' coverage, and while he left most ratings the same he made a few tweaks. Lilly was upgraded to overweight from equal weight, and its price target lifted to 95 from 75, based on the promising pipeline and management's commitment to lowering expenses. Meacham said that Lilly could be building a ""major autoimmune disease franchise"" with its late-stage drug candidates ixekizumab (for psoriasis) and baricitinib, a rheumatoid-arthritis drug it's developing with Incyte (INCY).""Based on the solid Phase 3 data, we view baricitinib as having significant market share potential in rheumatoid arthritis,"" Meacham wrote. ""Our model conservatively projects 2025 risk-adjusted sales of $1.2 billion vs. peak sales of $1.5 billion for (Pfizer 's (PFE) Xeljanz.""Meacham called diabetes drug Jardiance Lilly's ""most important commercial asset over the intermediate term"" since its recent study results showed it sharply reduced deaths from heart failure . He admitted that this has been an overhang for Merck, as it derives a lot of its revenue from competing drug Jardiance, but argued that the stock has overreacted.""While we acknowledge there are multiple headwinds and risks that make Merck a 'show me' story, we think even under most potential negative scenarios that there is too much underlying value to ignore,"" Meacham wrote as he raised Merck's rating to overweight from equal weight and hiked its price target to 66 from 65. ""Even if pipeline assets aren't blockbusters, they add up and are nearly free at the current valuation.""Lilly stock was up almost 5% near 86 in afternoon trading on the stock market today, while Merck stock was up 2% near 54.Meacham also raised J&J to overweight from equal weight, with the price target rising $14 to 155. As with Merck, he felt that the market is undervaluing J&J.""J&J has underperformed the S&P 500 and DRG over the past 12 months due to concerns about the impact of biosimilars on Remicade, low near-term earnings growth, and a lack of significant near-term pipeline catalysts,"" Meacham wrote. ""This has led to calls to break up the conglomerate, but we believe this to be premature.""In Meacham's view, J&J would be better off acquiring growth assets, especially in pharma.J&J stock was up 1% in afternoon trading, near 102.Meanwhile Meacham downgraded AbbVie to equal weight from overweight and trimmed the price target to 72 from 73. Like many analysts, he thought that AbbVie's projections for recently acquired blood-cancer drug Imbruvica and similar drugs in the pipeline — some $20 billion a year at peak — are too high.""Imbruvica and other oncology assets likely to succeed, but the field is highly competitive,"" Meacham wrote.AbbVie stock initially dropped almost 2% in Tuesday's trading, but by afternoon was up about 1.5% near 59.Follow Amy Reeves on Twitter @IBD_Areeves and on Facebook.

382,LLY,"The managers of $2.1 billion Columbia Mid Cap Growth Fund spun their wheels a bit in a difficult third quarter, but have kept their mutual fund on course. After outperforming the broad stock market and peer group tracked by Morningstar in the first and second quarters, the mutual fund lagged its peers in Q3. Some of that underperformance came from holdings in the energy sector.To cope, the fund has cut its energy weighting. It also saw energy holdings lose value. Its energy weighting of 1.56% as of Sept. 30 was more than 5 percentage points lower than a year earlier.In the case of trims, proceeds were recycled into stocks where the managers see better risk-reward opportunities for investors, says lead manager George Myers. ""We invest in growth companies, but we aren't willing to overpay,"" Myers said.The approach has worked long-term as well as recently. The fund's 7.09% gain this year going into Tuesday topped 94% of its peers. The S&P 500 was up 3.27%.The fund carries a B+ 36-month Performance Rating from IBD, having performed among the top 20% of all mutual funds in that period.One stock they added to in Q3 was Signature Bank (SBNY), which is on IBD's Leaderboard. ""We like this bank because, unlike big bank competitors, they offer customers a single point of contact,"" Myers said. ""You don't get passed from one person to another. And the bank continues to take market share.""Myers said the bank's pay package attracts talented employees, who bring their books of business.And Signature stands to benefit from any Federal Reserve interest rate hike.All-Weather StocksThe fund aims for growth stocks that are able to grow earnings no matter where we are in an economic cycle. To do that, a company needs a unique or at least superior product or service.""For example, higher interest rates won't impact people's need to buy products from Incyte (INCY), the oncology (and rheumatoid arthritis) company,"" Myers said.The managers like the prospects for Incyte to build on revenue from new products in addition to its cancer treatment Jakafi. It is working to develop a cancer immunotherapy. And Myers says tests have been promising for a rheumatoid arthritis drug it is developing in a partnership with Eli Lilly (LLY).""We think Incyte's product is superior to (AbbVie (ABBV)'s) Humira, which sells for north of $15 billion globally,"" he said.LinkedIn (LNKD) is another stock that the managers like. ""Our long-term thesis is that the talent solution segment, which is 60% of the business, will be better than people expect,"" said co-manager Brian Neigut. ""The marketing solution segment, which was under pressure in 2015, will also continue to do better than Wall Street expects based on new product updates and ancillary products.""Roper Technologies (ROP) is another favorite that the fund shifted money into. Co-manager William Chamberlain likes the company's knack for making accretive acquisitions such as legal software firm Aderant, in October. He also likes its wide variety of products.Chamberlain calls Roper an industrial firm that he increasingly thinks of as a tech stock.Ultimate Software Group (ULTI) is another fund favorite. The company benefits from an ongoing shift of payroll services to the cloud. ""In 2016 we expect accelerating revenue growth, which will set them apart from many other tech companies, Myers said.

397,LLY,"Goldman Sachs analyst Salveen Richter launched coverage on a group of smid-cap biotech stocks Wednesday, rating the sector as neutral but flagging four stocks as worthy of investor attention. Here are his top picks: Bluebird Bio (BLUE): Richter gave this young biotech a buy rating at a price target of 165, a whopping 107% premium over Tuesday's closing price. Bluebird stock suffered a setback earlier this month when its gene-therapy treatment LentiGlobin missed investors' sky-high hopes in beta thalassemia and sickle-cell disease. But the setback just made for a more attractive entry point for Richter.""Bluebird is also developing Lenti-D, a gene therapy for the rare fatal neurological disease childhood cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy (CCALD), with interim pivotal data expected in 2016,"" Richter noted in his report. ""Beta-thalassemia and CCALD appear somewhat priced in (peak $1 billion and $176 million sales in 2026, respectively), but the sickle cell disease opportunity is upside to current levels (peak $3 billion sales).""Bluebird stock rose 6.3% on the stock market today, to 85.59. BioMarin Pharmaceutical (BMRN): While Goldman Sachs is transferring coverage of this rare-disease specialist from Richter to fellow analyst Terence Flynn, Richter included it in his report with a price target of 158, a 47% premium on Tuesday's close. The analysts noted a ""slew of catalysts"" coming up for BioMarin, including next week's FDA advisory committee meeting on Kyndrisa (drisapersen), the treatment for Duchenne muscular dystrophy that the company acquired last year. Approval of this drug is highly uncertain, given the lack of previously approved drugs for the disease as well as the fact that Kyndrisa technically failed its most recent clinical trial.""We believe the event is likely to be positive, based on data totality (including new analyses), BioMarin's ability to explain the limitations of the failed phase three study (with two controlled phase two trials having shown benefit), the unmet need of the disease, precedent of prior approvals and strong lobbying efforts from patient advocacy groups,"" said the report.BioMarin stock rose a fraction Wednesday, to 107.70. Kite Pharma (KITE): Richter assigned this stock a 39% upside by giving it a price target of 111. He pegged the American Society of Hematology (ASH) conference in early December — where Kite is scheduled to present midstage trial data on KTE-C19, its chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy for blood cancer — as the major near-term catalyst for this stock.""Focus will be on whether Kite can reproduce prior efficacy/safety data in its ongoing pivotal study, having brought manufacturing in-house, and in the competitive landscape,"" Richter wrote. ""In 2016, we expect KTE-C19 interim data in (the second half) to support a regulatory filing by year-end 2016.""Richter added that next year should also bring early-stage data on several other programs for glioblastoma (malignant brain tumor), cervical cancer and head-and-neck cancer.Kite stock rose 8.7% Wednesday, to 86.85. Incyte (INCY): Richter gave this stock a price target of 135 and a 19% upside, calling it ""(the) best-positioned biotech immuno-oncology (IO) company for 2016.""""The lead drug, Jakafi, is on track for $2 billion in U.S. sales (Novartis (NVS) partnership ex-U.S.), and we expect revenue stream diversification with baricitinib (Lilly (LLY) partnership) with market entry in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) likely in late '16/early '17,"" Richter wrote. ""Incyte shares could see more inflection points with 1) initial data from three phase-one/-two combination studies of IDO (Bristol-Myers Squibb's (BMY) PD-1, AstraZeneca's (AZN) PD-L1 and Roche's (RHHBY) PD-L1), likely through first half of 2016 and at ASCO (Jun 3-6, 2015), and 2) decisions to advance IDO combinations into pivotal testing in non-small-cell lung cancer ($1.9 billion peak sales), based on data that will become available 'in house' to Incyte and its collaborators.""

"
403,LLY,"The study's primary endpoint for the drug baricitinib was simply to do better than the placebo as measured on the ACR20 test, which signifies at least a 20% improvement in symptoms. But the drug also outperformed Humira, both on the ARC20 and Disease Activity Score 28 tests after 12 weeks of treatment, and after 24 weeks beat Humira in a measure of joint damage. Lilly and Incyte did not give exact numbers but said detailed data will come in future medical meetings and publications.
"

"

On safety in the trial, the press release reports that serious adverse events for baricitinib were similar to placebo although lower for Humira,"" Schoenebaum wrote in an email to clients.

411,LLY,"Best Mutual Funds 2015: October Performance Report
"
412,LLY,"The $1.2 billion Neuberger Berman Mid Cap Growth Fund is looking to regain the top-notch form it displayed earlier this year, before the made-in-China sell-off dragged down the overall market.
"
413,LLY,"The fund, run by Ken Turek for nearly 13 years, was topping 85% of its midcap growth peers over the past 12 months ended Oct. 31, with a 7.55% gain, according to Morningstar Inc.
"
414,LLY,"That's after the mutual fund slid 7.88% in the past three months, which included the August-September broad market tumble.
"
415,LLY,"Longer-term, Neuberger Berman Mid Cap Growth is a top performing mutual fund that has made a lot of money for its investors.
"
416,LLY,"Over the past five years, the fund's 13.42% average annual gain beat 71% of its direct rivals.
"
417,LLY,"And like many of his rivals, he got a boost by the October rally with IBD from his office in Chicago.
"
418,LLY,"IBD: Like a lot of mutual funds, your portfolio endured a challenging third quarter. October's stock market rally brought relief to you. The Q3 culprits seemed to be the China correction, the Federal Reserve delaying its long-promised interest-rate hike and political bashing of drugmakers. Does that square with your account?
"
419,LLY,"Turek: I think you hit it on the head. From a macro standpoint, the first two points are spot on. Issues in China, the devaluation, caused a lot of uncertainty in global growth and impact on emerging markets.
"
420,LLY,"It put a lot of questions on the table, especially for U.S. exports.
"
421,LLY,"And the Fed punting was not well taken by the marketplace.
"
422,LLY,"From a secular standpoint, health care affected us quite a bit. It started with (Hillary) Clinton's (critical) chatter about drug pricing (being excessive). Then there was piling on by other pundits and politicians. But pricing (criticism) is not a new thing. It's been around, and it will be around. So this too shall pass.
"
423,LLY,"IBD: You trimmed some health stocks due to the beating that segment was taking, right?
"
424,LLY,"Turek: We weren't so concerned about the health care services area, like hospitals. Where we trimmed was in a couple of areas: therapeutics and biotech.
"
425,LLY,"We had success in (those areas). So part of our trimming was profit-taking. Part was due to the uncertainty that the pricing risk to the industry created. We don't know how that will play out. So we more or less across the board trimmed a lot of positions.
"
426,LLY,"IBD: And by ""therapeutics"" you mean which types of stocks?
"
427,LLY,"Turek: Specialty pharmaceuticals and biotech. It does not include the Bristol-Myers Squibbs (BMY) of the world. They're too big. There aren't a lot of regular drugmakers in our midcap space. They're too big. We're interested in smaller versions of Eli Lilly (LLY), Merck (MRK) and Bristol-Myers.
"
428,LLY,"The smaller companies we focus on are specialized in one or two areas of health care.
"
429,LLY,"IBD: You like innovators, right?
"
430,LLY,"Turek: Yes, we look for that whether they're in tech, health care or consumer discretionary.
"
431,LLY,"We like companies that are doing something unique. If a company has a competitive advantage or a moat, so much the better. The advantage could be something like a new drug or software product. In consumer discretionary, it might be that the company is innovative, like Under Armour (UA), coming out with new products consistently, expanding rapidly as well. A couple of years ago, they only made apparel. Now they're coming out with footwear.
"
432,LLY,"IBD: In what sectors are you increasing your weights?
"
433,LLY,"Turek: In October, not much at all. We're watching. Where we're interested in doing that is in tech. And to be quite honest about it: In health care, prices have come down so much that maybe it's overdone. Prices have started to look pretty cheap in the past six to eight weeks.
"
434,LLY,"So perhaps in the near future, we'll be at a point where interest in that area increases quite a bit.
"
435,LLY,"We'll pass on some. But we'll get back to others based on fundamentals — companies that are doing something new and innovative, that deserve to be paid for.
"
436,LLY,"IBD: Do you still like Palo Alto Networks (PANW) despite its recent pullback?
"
437,LLY,"Turek: We still like it. These guys are best of breed as far as creating the next-generation firewall and security, as opposed to a single-point product provider.
"
438,LLY,"We don't think anything has changed. And there's still a high degree of need for security spending from all kinds of enterprises and government units as well. That's not necessarily going to abate.
"
439,LLY,"Competition is vigorous, but Palo Alto has done a good job of being innovative in designing and offering a suite of products to forestall hacking.
"
440,LLY,"IBD: Describe the attractive innovations of Ultimate Software Group (ULTI).
"
441,LLY,"Turek: Ultimate is a human-capital management company. Their niche is the marketplace below large companies, companies with 500 to 1,500 employees, which was their sweet spot for a long time.
"
442,LLY,"They offer cloud-based solutions, so you get continuous updates and upgrades for a suite of products. It makes the cost of ownership affordable, especially for midsize companies that don't necessarily have IT expertise in-house.
"
443,LLY,"What they've done in the past year is move down-market to companies with between 100 and 500 employees. They're starting at the high end of that. And they're having good success.
"
444,LLY,"That's going to add to their top-line growth. They have a high retention rate, over 95% if I remember correctly.
"
445,LLY,"IBD: What innovation by Avago Technologies (AVGO) interests you the most right now?
"
446,LLY,"Turek: Avago is a fabless semiconductor (company). They outsource manufacturing to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) and others.
"
447,LLY,"Their big thing is called FBAR, which stands for ""film bulk acoustic resonators."" FBARs are important, as the amount of data and signals from the expansion in the number of wireless phones causes noise. FBARs smooth out the noise and prevent dropped calls.
"
448,LLY,"As the technology for wireless gets more complicated, more FBARs are needed in each phone.
"
449,LLY,"But even that won't last forever, so they've bought companies to diversify their business stream.
"
450,LLY,"IBD: What made IT hardware and software provider CDW's (CDW) earnings per share grow 9%, 19% and 21% the past three stanzas?
"
451,LLY,"Turek: CDW is a leading distributor of all things information-related. The value they add is that customers — many of which are small or midsize and don't have a lot of in-house IT expertise — rely on CDW to solve problems. They (do that by partnering) customers with their general sales reps and with sales engineers who are experts in fields like Wi-Fi and routing.
"
452,LLY,"IBD: If the U.S. economy is improving, and if car sales are rising, why do consumers need car parts for repairs of older cars? What's the appeal of O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY)?
"
453,LLY,"Turek: The average age of the U.S. car fleet hasn't changed much in recent years, even as new-car sales have risen.
"
454,LLY,"What's transforming the company is that they used to sell just to do-it-yourselfers. What the company did was start to sell parts to the professional or do-it-for-you channel. And they've had a lot of success in that. They're not necessarily selling to dealers, although they do. They're selling to mom-and-pop car-repair shops.
"
455,LLY,"IBD: What is Signet Jewelers' (SIG) innovation?
"
456,LLY,"Turek: We got interested when they bought a primary competitor, Zales. Signet was a better operator. So the opportunity was that Signet would overlay their management ability on Zales and improve the top and bottom lines of Zales over time.
"
457,LLY,"They've owned it about a year and have started to have success in those areas. Unlocking the value in Zales was important (to our decision to invest).
"
458,LLY,"Most recently, this quarter Signet plans their biggest new product introduction ever, a diamond ring called Ever Us, a high-quality diamond ring set that it will roll out across all of their stores. That's unusual. We hope it will be a big product for them in 2015 and into '16.
"
459,LLY,"IBD: You've increased your stake in Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) in recent disclosures. Why do you like them more than other cruiselines?
"
460,LLY,"Turek: They attract a slightly higher-end customer, who are less sensitive to price increases and economic shifts as well.
"
461,LLY,"NCL has a high yield on their ships. They haven't added capacity at the same pace as their competitors, so they're easier to fill for cruises. And, knock on wood, they're accident free, which helps their reputation.
"
462,LLY,"So recently we've liked their pricing power. It's a better offering than Royal Caribbean (RCL). And (low) oil prices have been a tailwind. Plus, they face new opportunities. They're eager to see what happens to Cuba. And now China is opening to cruisers. These should aid NCL and the industry.
"
463,LLY,"IBD: Why have you boosted your stake in Alaska Air Group (ALK) rather than some other airline?
"
464,LLY,"Turek: These guys are really good operators. They started as a West Coast airline. Now they're going transcontinental and midcontinental. They have really good financials, good return on equity, good free cash flow, good customer satisfaction levels. They're growing in the low double digits for the next couple of years. And it's a joy to listen to them talk about their business. They're having fun.
"
465,LLY,"IBD: Why did you start a stake in Tyler Technologies (TYL) this year?
"
466,LLY,"Turek: We started it in June or July, I think. It came from something my analyst had talked about. They're a leader in providing financial and ERP (enterprise resource planning) software to local and state governments.
"
467,LLY,"A lot of those governments are behind in technology, compared with private enterprises, so there's a need for them to modernize a lot of their systems.
"
468,LLY,"Tyler was a leader in the criminal justice area and has branched out into other areas like appraisal, taxes, public safety and vital records. Governments are getting that moving from legacy paper-based records to cloud-based records makes records easier to manage and makes things easier for us as consumers of public records.
"
469,LLY,"You wouldn't think it's a great market, but it is, even with the headwind of a lack of financing.
"
470,LLY,"IBD: Why have you been edging up your stake in Acuity Brands (AYI), a maker of lighting products?
"
471,LLY,"Turek: This is a play on energy efficiency in nonresidential areas. It's not wholly dependent on new construction. A lot of it is retrofitting. They replace a lot of old fluorescent lights with LEDs, which save energy — money — for owners of those businesses.Best Mutual Funds 2015: October Performance ReportThe $1.2 billion Neuberger Berman Mid Cap Growth Fund is looking to regain the top-notch form it displayed earlier this year, before the made-in-China sell-off dragged down the overall market.The fund, run by Ken Turek for nearly 13 years, was topping 85% of its midcap growth peers over the past 12 months ended Oct. 31, with a 7.55% gain, according to Morningstar Inc.That's after the mutual fund slid 7.88% in the past three months, which included the August-September broad market tumble.Longer-term, Neuberger Berman Mid Cap Growth is a top performing mutual fund that has made a lot of money for its investors.Over the past five years, the fund's 13.42% average annual gain beat 71% of its direct rivals.And like many of his rivals, he got a boost by the October rally with IBD from his office in Chicago.IBD: Like a lot of mutual funds, your portfolio endured a challenging third quarter.

These guys are best of breed as far as creating the next-generation firewall and security, as opposed to a single-point product provider.We don't think anything has changed. And there's still a high degree of need for security spending from all kinds of enterprises and government units as well. That's not necessarily going to abate.Competition is vigorous, but Palo Alto has done a good job of being innovative in designing and offering a suite of products to forestall hacking.IBD: Describe the attractive innovations of Ultimate Software Group (ULTI).Turek: Ultimate is a human-capital management company. Their niche is the marketplace below large companies, companies with 500 to 1,500 employees, which was their sweet spot for a long time.They offer cloud-based solutions, so you get continuous updates and upgrades for a suite of products. It makes the cost of ownership affordable, especially for midsize companies that don't necessarily have IT expertise in-house.What they've done in the past year is move down-market to companies with between 100 and 500 employees. They're starting at the high end of that. And they're having good success.That's going to add to their top-line growth. They have a high retention rate, over 95% if I remember correctly.IBD: What innovation by Avago Technologies (AVGO) interests you the most right now?Turek: Avago is a fabless semiconductor (company). They outsource manufacturing to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) and others.Their big thing is called FBAR, which stands for ""film bulk acoustic resonators."" FBARs are important, as the amount of data and signals from the expansion in the number of wireless phones causes noise. FBARs smooth out the noise and prevent dropped calls.As the technology for wireless gets more complicated, more FBARs are needed in each phone.But even that won't last forever, so they've bought companies to diversify their business stream.IBD: What made IT hardware and software provider CDW's (CDW) earnings per share grow 9%, 19% and 21% the past three stanzas?Turek: CDW is a leading distributor of all things information-related. The value they add is that customers — many of which are small or midsize and don't have a lot of in-house IT expertise — rely on CDW to solve problems. They (do that by partnering) customers with their general sales reps and with sales engineers who are experts in fields like Wi-Fi and routing.IBD: If the U.S. economy is improving, and if car sales are rising, why do consumers need car parts for repairs of older cars? What's the appeal of O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY)?Turek: The average age of the U.S. car fleet hasn't changed much in recent years, even as new-car sales have risen.What's transforming the company is that they used to sell just to do-it-yourselfers. What the company did was start to sell parts to the professional or do-it-for-you channel. And they've had a lot of success in that. They're not necessarily selling to dealers, although they do. They're selling to mom-and-pop car-repair shops.IBD: What is Signet Jewelers' (SIG) innovation?Turek: We got interested when they bought a primary competitor, Zales. Signet was a better operator. So the opportunity was that Signet would overlay their management ability on Zales and improve the top and bottom lines of Zales over time.They've owned it about a year and have started to have success in those areas. Unlocking the value in Zales was important (to our decision to invest).Most recently, this quarter Signet plans their biggest new product introduction ever, a diamond ring called Ever Us, a high-quality diamond ring set that it will roll out across all of their stores. That's unusual. We hope it will be a big product for them in 2015 and into '16.IBD: You've increased your stake in Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) in recent disclosures. Why do you like them more than other cruiselines?Turek: They attract a slightly higher-end customer, who are less sensitive to price increases and economic shifts as well.NCL has a high yield on their ships. They haven't added capacity at the same pace as their competitors, so they're easier to fill for cruises. And, knock on wood, they're accident free, which helps their reputation.So recently we've liked their pricing power. It's a better offering than Royal Caribbean (RCL). And (low) oil prices have been a tailwind. Plus, they face new opportunities. They're eager to see what happens to Cuba. And now China is opening to cruisers. These should aid NCL and the industry.IBD: Why have you boosted your stake in Alaska Air Group (ALK) rather than some other airline?Turek: These guys are really good operators. They started as a West Coast airline. Now they're going transcontinental and midcontinental. They have really good financials, good return on equity, good free cash flow, good customer satisfaction levels. They're growing in the low double digits for the next couple of years. And it's a joy to listen to them talk about their business. They're having fun.IBD: Why did you start a stake in Tyler Technologies (TYL) this year?Turek: We started it in June or July, I think. It came from something my analyst had talked about. They're a leader in providing financial and ERP (enterprise resource planning) software to local and state governments.A lot of those governments are behind in technology, compared with private enterprises, so there's a need for them to modernize a lot of their systems.Tyler was a leader in the criminal justice area and has branched out into other areas like appraisal, taxes, public safety and vital records. Governments are getting that moving from legacy paper-based records to cloud-based records makes records easier to manage and makes things easier for us as consumers of public records.You wouldn't think it's a great market, but it is, even with the headwind of a lack of financing.IBD: Why have you been edging up your stake in Acuity Brands (AYI), a maker of lighting products?Turek: This is a play on energy efficiency in nonresidential areas. It's not wholly dependent on new construction. A lot of it is retrofitting. They replace a lot of old fluorescent lights with LEDs, which save energy — money — for owners of those businesses.

"
489,LLY,"Headaches are among the most universal medical problems — but while merely a nuisance for most people, they can be much more than that for many sufferers.
"
490,LLY,"About 18% of U.S. women and 6% of men suffer from migraine, a severe form of headache often accompanied by nausea, hypersensitivity and sometimes visual hallucinations. While many sufferers get only one every month or two, about 2% of the population suffers from chronic migraine — with pain virtually every day.
"
491,LLY,"Traditionally, patients dealt with migraine the same way everybody deals with headaches — through over-the-counter and sometimes prescription pharmaceuticals aimed at pain in general. But a new class of biotech medicines, set to be showcased at the American Headache Society meeting in Washington, D.C., on June 18-21, could bring a sea change in treatment — and a big opportunity for investors.
"
492,LLY,"Drug giants Eli Lilly (LLY) and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA), along with big biotech Amgen (AMGN) and hot startup Alder BioPharmaceuticals (ALDR), are all developing anti-calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) monoclonal antibodies to fight migraine. CGRP, which is produced by neurons, modulates transmission of pain and dilation of blood vessels. Over a decade ago, Merck (MRK) targeted it to treat migraine through traditional small-molecule drug development.
"
493,LLY,"Marcelo Bigal, now head of Teva's migraine program, worked on the original Merck project.
"
494,LLY,"""It never failed on efficacy,"" Bigal told IBD. ""Five small molecules were developed against the target; they all succeeded. But the problem is ... we were causing liver toxicity. That's when we decided instead of developing a small chemical that antagonizes the receptor to CGRP, we'd develop antibodies against the target.""
"
495,LLY,"Antibodies are much more specific to the target, Bigal said, and are not degraded by the liver, so they wouldn't raise the liver toxicity problem. Their long half-life in the body meant that they weren't so helpful against an immediate attack of migraine, but they could be used prophylactically for patients who get frequent migraines.
"
496,LLY,"Other companies watching the failed Merck program got the same idea. And as early results started to come in, the industry started to take notice.
"
497,LLY,"Labrys Biologics, where Bigal moved to develop his antibodies, was acquired by Teva last June for $200 million upfront plus up to $625 million in milestone payments. At around the same time, Alder — which had been trading flat since its early-May IPO at 10 — started to take off. It has since more than quadrupled in price and trades above 45.
"
498,LLY,"The interest in migraine treatment comes partly from the potential size of the market. While not as big as something like lung cancer, migraine drug sales could reach $5 billion to $8 billion a year, advisory firm Evercore ISI estimates. And midstage data, some of which has been reported by all the companies involved, has looked good.
"
499,LLY,"Most of the companies are testing their products in two categories of patient: those with chronic migraines, defined as occurring at least 15 days a month, and those with episodic migraines, whose headaches are less frequent but still a monthly event.
"
500,LLY,"Alder CEO Randy Schatzman told IBD that the distinction is basically artificial. It was created when Allergan won approval for its anti-wrinkle drug Botox to prevent migraine in 2010, as it won approval only for chronic migraine. Actavis (ACT) has since acquired Allergan and Botox.
"
501,LLY,"The Botox regimen is effective, but it's not for the faint-hearted: It involves 31 shots about the head every three months and generally requires two full cycles of therapy. The CGRP antibodies are also injected but make less of a pincushion of the patient. Alder's ALD403 is delivered by a single IV infusion every three months, Teva's TEV-48125 and Amgen's AMG 334 by subcutaneous monthly injection, and Lilly's LY2951742 by biweekly subcutaneous injection.
"
502,LLY,"All the companies have reported phase-two results in episodic migraine except Teva, which will report its episodic data at this month's meeting and reported its chronic-migraine results last month.
"
503,LLY,"While the companies' methodologies differ slightly, making comparisons inexact, their results have been broadly similar: reducing headache days by about one per month.
"
504,LLY,"But what attracted the attention of some on Wall Street were the ""hyper-responders"" — those who were headache-free in the third month of treatment. Amgen did not use this metric, but Lilly's drug achieved it in 15% of patients in the episodic trial, as did Teva's in its chronic-migraine trial. Alder's drug eliminated headaches in 24% of patients in the third month; 16% of them had suffered no headaches since the start of treatment.
"
505,LLY,"""Personally, I think it's really the hyper-responders that may drive the commercial opportunity,"" wrote Evercore analyst Umer Raffat in a May 14 research note.
"
506,LLY,"Opinion does not seem to have coalesced around a clear front-runner. There are differences between the drugs, in addition to the dosing regimens already mentioned. Amgen's AMG-334 targets the CGRP receptor, while the other products target a ligand — a substance that binds to a protein or other structure to serve a biological purpose.
"
507,LLY,"""It's a little early to say what the differences between those two modalities are going to be,"" Alder's Schatzman said. ""That receptor is used by multiple ligands, and when we started our program, we worried that might bring in some biology that we didn't want to modulate. So we steered toward the ligand and stayed away from the receptor.""
"
508,LLY,"Teva's Bigal also notes that when comparing clinical trials, investors should realize that Teva's subjects continued taking their usual medications on top of the CGRP antibody, while those in the other trials did not.
"
509,LLY,"""We wanted to test the medication in the condition as the condition is ordinarily seen by doctors, not in an idealistic view of the condition,"" he said.
"
510,LLY,"Lilly, meanwhile, isn't even conducting a phase-two trial in chronic migraine, though it does have an ongoing episodic trial. Aaron Schacht, the global brand development leader for Lilly's pain business, says that Lilly, like Schatzman, doesn't think there's any real biological difference between chronic and episodic migraine. However, in order to win approval for both, the company will run phase-three trials for both patient groups.
"
511,LLY,"Lilly is also unique in that it's also testing its CGRP antibody outside of migraine. It's started a clinical trial in cluster headaches, a much less common but excruciatingly painful type of headache that occurs on one side of the head, usually around the eye. Schacht says that the FDA might even give Lilly an orphan-drug designation on that use, which would shield it from competition after approval. Lilly's also running a study on arthritic knee pain.
"
512,LLY,"""We believe CGRP is involved in a variety of different pain states,"" Schacht told IBD. ""This is where Lilly's experience with (anxiety drug) Cymbalta, and being able search out the concept of a broad pain indication, is something that we're quite interested in with regards to this molecule.""Headaches are among the most universal medical problems — but while merely a nuisance for most people, they can be much more than that for many sufferers.About 18% of U.S. women and 6% of men suffer from migraine, a severe form of headache often accompanied by nausea, hypersensitivity and sometimes visual hallucinations.

"
515,LLY,"Aaron Levie is always full of energy, always on the go.
"
516,LLY,"Levie left college early to create Box (BOX), an enterprise-class data management and collaboration platform that Levie says is transformative.
"
517,LLY,"As Box chairman and chief executive, Levie led the company's initial public offering on Jan. 23, which raised $175 million.
"
518,LLY,"Levie recently spoke with IBD about his company and industry.
"
519,LLY,"IBD: In your Q4 earnings conference call with analysts, you said Box is creating a new category. How so?
"
520,LLY,"Levie: As technology moves from on-premise systems to the cloud, there's a whole bunch of change that happens.
"
521,LLY,"Salesforce.com (CRM) was able to create a new sales force automation and CRM platform from the cloud. Workday (WDAY) was able to disrupt the human resources, human capital management segment with the cloud.
"
522,LLY,"What we're going after is all of the investment in content management software, storage technology and search appliances — all the things that enterprises need to be able to store and manage their data. We basically moved that to our cloud platform.
"
523,LLY,"We are creating a new category where we're not just managing content, we're not just helping you search it or secure your content, we're helping you collaborate as well. So that's enterprise content collaboration — and that's the market we are going after.
"
524,LLY,"IBD: What is the market size opportunity? I've heard widely different estimates.
"
525,LLY,"Levie: The reason there are different calculations is that a lot depends on how much of that technology can be replaced and subsumed over time by our platform. Certainly we are disruptive to the content management industry. We're disruptive to the on-premise storage technology industry. We combine those solutions into one. That is a tens-of-billions-of-dollars opportunity that we're going after.
"
526,LLY,"IBD: Some say there are three dozen companies in this field. How will Box remain a leader?
"
527,LLY,"Levie: We've been competing in this landscape for 10 years. When a chief information officer sets out to standardize on a platform for their critical corporate information, there are far fewer choices that you have as an enterprise. You can't really go to Amazon's (AMZN) file sharing tool, you can't really go to Dropbox, you can't really go to Google (GOOGL) Drive.
"
528,LLY,"So it largely comes down to us and Microsoft (MSFT).
"
529,LLY,"I think (research firms) Forrester, Gartner and others will confirm that we're really the leader in the market because of our focus on enterprise security, scalability and content management.
"
530,LLY,"When we do go up against Microsoft, we actually win two-thirds of the time. Even in those situations the customer is still likely buying something from Microsoft — Office 365, or the Office productivity suite. But they are using Box for the content management and security around that information.
"
531,LLY,"So even when we do go head-to-head we often still see customers buying our solution alongside Microsoft. We think our differentiation is very clear. It allows us to command a premium price point at a premium position in this market.
"
532,LLY,"IBD: Don't you also have a partnership with Microsoft?

533,LLY,"Levie: We recently announced a partnership with Microsoft as an inaugural member of their cloud storage partner program. When you are a user of Office 365, Box will allow you to seamlessly take your data from Box and interact it with Office products. So, as I mentioned, even when we win an account against Microsoft, customers are still likely buying a Microsoft solution. It's not a zero-sum game where you have to use only one product or another. The synergies and the integration between our products will increase over time.
"
534,LLY,"IBD: So you are just as much a partner with Microsoft as a competitor?
"
535,LLY,"Levie: I think so. I think that is where the trend is going, and you'll see more partnership integration over time with Microsoft.
"
536,LLY,"IBD: Most of your users are using the free version of Box. Is the freemium business model still the best way to go?
"
537,LLY,"Levie: We definitely use free user traction as a way to get into the enterprise. Once Box gets brought into the enterprise, then we can work with those companies and sell a more secure or advanced version of our product.
"
538,LLY,"So when you look at General Electric (GE) or Eli Lilly (LLY), these organizations first started out with users of our free product. Then we were able to sell an enterprise-wide solution to them. More and more, over time, our mix shift is going to go to larger enterprises, where our investment in our sales force and key partnerships with Microsoft and others will be very important.
"
539,LLY,"IBD: Is there a stickiness to your product that once you start you tend to stay?
"
540,LLY,"Levie: We have a very high retention rate. As customers expand their investment in Box, over time, there is a high degree of stickiness. Once you adopt our solution and have more and more of your critical files on our platform, it means that we can drive more productivity and can deliver new, more transformative-use cases within your business. That leads to a very high retention rate and a longer-term demand for our service with customers.
"
541,LLY,"IBD: What do you find satisfying about what you've achieved?
"
542,LLY,"Levie: We definitely love the fact that we're at a stage where we have meaningful conversations with some of the world's largest enterprises. We help them transform how they are using their data and how they are delivering IT in their organization. We have worked for 10 years to build out a differentiated platform and now we have some of the world's largest health care companies, media companies, energy companies and others that are using our product to really transform how they're working.
"
543,LLY,"We have a road map that we think reflects where the world is going and will help us continue to offer a premium service.Aaron Levie is always full of energy, always on the go.Levie left college early to create Box (BOX), an enterprise-class data management and collaboration platform that Levie says is transformative.As Box chairman and chief executive, Levie led the company's initial public offering on Jan. 23, which raised $175 million.Levie recently spoke with IBD about his company and industry.IBD: In your Q4 earnings conference call with analysts, you said Box is creating a new category. How so?Levie: As technology moves from on-premise systems to the cloud, there's a whole bunch of change that happens.Salesforce.com (CRM) was able to create a new sales force automation and CRM platform from the cloud. Workday (WDAY) was able to disrupt the human resources, human capital management segment with the cloud.What we're going after is all of the investment in content management software, storage technology and search appliances — all the things that enterprises need to be able to store and manage their data. We basically moved that to our cloud platform.We are creating a new category where we're not just managing content, we're not just helping you search it or secure your content, we're helping you collaborate as well. So that's enterprise content collaboration — and that's the market we are going after.IBD: What is the market size opportunity? I've heard widely different estimates.Levie: The reason there are different calculations is that a lot depends on how much of that technology can be replaced and subsumed over time by our platform. Certainly we are disruptive to the content management industry. We're disruptive to the on-premise storage technology industry. We combine those solutions into one. That is a tens-of-billions-of-dollars opportunity that we're going after.IBD: Some say there are three dozen companies in this field. How will Box remain a leader?Levie: We've been competing in this landscape for 10 years. When a chief information officer sets out to standardize on a platform for their critical corporate information, there are far fewer choices that you have as an enterprise. You can't really go to Amazon's (AMZN) file sharing tool, you can't really go to Dropbox, you can't really go to Google (GOOGL) Drive.So it largely comes down to us and Microsoft (MSFT).I think (research firms) Forrester, Gartner and others will confirm that we're really the leader in the market because of our focus on enterprise security, scalability and content management.When we do go up against Microsoft, we actually win two-thirds of the time. Even in those situations the customer is still likely buying something from Microsoft — Office 365, or the Office productivity suite. But they are using Box for the content management and security around that information.So even when we do go head-to-head we often still see customers buying our solution alongside Microsoft. We think our differentiation is very clear. It allows us to command a premium price point at a premium position in this market.IBD: Don't you also have a partnership with Microsoft?Levie: We recently announced a partnership with Microsoft as an inaugural member of their cloud storage partner program. When you are a user of Office 365, Box will allow you to seamlessly take your data from Box and interact it with Office products.

"

570,LLY,"When it comes to developing cutting-edge real estate for Big Pharma and tech firms, Alexandria Real Estate Equities CEO Joel Marcus has refined a tried-and-true formula.Started by Marcus back in 1994, Alexandria (ARE) is a real estate investment trust focused on developing science and technology campuses in top urban clusters, adjacent to leading academic and medical institutions, in order to create a collaborative environment.The company's activity is centered on science hubs — such as Cambridge, Mass., the San Francisco Bay Area, San Diego and New York City.""Our platform focuses on irreplaceable urban innovation centers,"" Marcus told IBD.""They're great places to recruit talent, the transportation is good and they have a 24/7 work-play environment,"" he added. ""We try to own and operate and dominate the market in these irreplaceable markets.""The facilities are high tech and advanced, he says, and they include the kind of infrastructure that companies need to do research and development.""We take the campus location and state-of-the-art facilities and marry them at the intersection of science and technology,"" Marcus said. ""That's really been the secret of our success.""Building For Big NamesUsing this approach, Alexandria has developed campuses for drugmakers such as Eli Lilly (LLY), Novartis (NVS) and Pfizer (PFE), plus IBD Leaderboard stock Illumina (ILMN), a genetic-testing equipment maker.This year, which marks Alexandria's 20th anniversary, the company has had plenty of cause to celebrate. Earnings have started to grow again, with double-digit increases the past two quarters, after no gains from the end of 2011 through 2013.In the third quarter, earnings rose 14% to $1.21 a share. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect 2014 earnings to rise 11% to $4.79 a share following declines the prior four years. They see an 8% rise in 2015 and a 4% increase in 2016.Alexandria's stock price has lifted 36% this year.What's been fueling its growth? Marcus says Alexandria has several factors working in its favor.""We're in a very good economic environment, the Fed has kept interest rates low and we've seen substantially rising rents in urban innovation markets,"" he said. ""There's also a constrained supply. The demand we're seeing from the life science and tech sectors are the highest levels we've seen in the 20-year history of the company.""Marcus adds that the company is seeing ""strong internal growth,"" driven by high occupancy and increasing rental rates in its core markets of Cambridge, San Francisco and New York.Alexandria has a $1 billion pipeline of projects under construction, around 85% of which are leased or under negotiations, says Marcus. That's the highest pre-lease level Alexandria has had.The company has another $1 billion pipeline of projects it will put into play in 2015, he says, adding that both pipelines will help drive ""strong demand and continued up earnings"" over the next few years.Marcus, who used to work as a capital markets lawyer, founded Alexandria to address the real estate infrastructure needs of the biotech industry, which he says were unfilled at the time.""We have a first-mover advantage in almost every market in real estate development,"" he said. ""We focus on urban innovation campuses, and no one else really does that.""Healthy Outlook?RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Carroll says one competitor is BioMed Realty Trust (BMR). It's a REIT focused on providing real estate to the life science industry. Other REITs also dabble in the space, he adds, but it's the location of Alexandria's campuses in urban cluster markets that's the differentiating factor.Carroll said the macro environment for the life science industry looks good: ""You're starting to see the pharma tenants that used to own their own real estate in other locations are finding they're getting better results (in terms of) their ability to do research and collaborate more with people within the industry when they move to these core cluster markets owned by other landlords.""Alexandria has been able to create cluster market campuses in some of the major markets in the U.S., Carroll adds.""Now that tech tenants are finding that they like that atmosphere, they're getting demand from tech tenants too,"" he said.One recent tech project, announced in September, is a strategic partnership with app developer Uber Technologies, whose low-fare ride-sharing service has caught on as a taxi alternative. The project includes the acquisition of two key parcels in the Mission Bay area of San Francisco.What's The Deal With Uber?These parcels will support 422,980 rentable square feet of new, ground-up facilities. The joint venture will be 51% owned by Alexandria and 49% by Uber. It will let Uber expand its corporate headquarters in San Francisco in conjunction with a 15-year lease for the entire project.Alexandria is expected to break ground on the project in January 2015 and finish it by the end of 2016.Mission Bay is home to a campus of the University of California, San Francisco, as well as Alexandria's science and technology cluster, which was recently selected to house the future arena of the Golden State Warriors of the NBA.Marcus said the Uber venture is ""very significant because it has very strong yields, and shareholders will reap the benefits with great cash flow.""It represents a milestone to bring more tech companies to Mission Bay, which historically was more of a life science destination, Marcus adds.Carroll also called the venture with Uber significant: ""There's a lot of demand in that area ... in Mission Bay South of Market (SoMa) in San Francisco.""With a market cap around $6.2 billion, Alexandria is one of the smaller companies in IBD's Finance-Property REIT industry group; the largest is Simon Property Group (SPG) with a market cap of $56.6 billion.The group ranks No. 79 in performance of the 197 that IBD tracks.The Medical-Ethical Drugs industry group, where several of Alexandria's customers reside, ranks No. 23, and Medical-Biomed/Biotech ranks No. 4.

573,LLY,"Before founding software company Veeva Systems in 2007, Peter Gassner was certain of two things.He wanted the technology to be cloud-based and to address critical issues for a specific industry. He decided to focus on life sciences.""We could have picked something else, like oil and gas. But that's the one we picked. For one thing, it's a big industry and I like big industries. I knew there was a massive need for good cloud solutions,"" he told IBD.Turned out to be a good idea —Veeva (VEEV) is one of the most successful cloud-based software companies around. Not only has revenue been growing in double digits, it's also profitable.""Cloud companies are usually growing but not usually profitable,"" said Gassner, who is Veeva's CEO. ""We know who we are making products for. It's not a guessing game. So we can have lower sales and marketing costs.""It helped that co-founder and president Matt Wallach built the life science business at Siebel Systems, since acquired by Oracle (ORCL).""He had relationships with all these pharmaceutical companies and said, 'Here's a better version,'"" said Brendan Barnicle, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities. ""A lot of (Veeva's) business is replacing old Siebel systems.""Building SteamVeeva has more than 200 pharmaceutical and biotech customers. They include more than 30 of the 50 largest drug companies worldwide, and range from drug giants such as Merck (MRK), Novartis (NVS) and Eli Lilly (LLY) to emerging biotech outfits.One of Veeva's customers is Gilead Sciences (GILD), the maker of Hepatitis-C wonder drugs. Gilead has been buying more products from Veeva as it grows and expands worldwide, Gassner says.With plenty of customers, Veeva keeps expanding coverage, or users, in those companies and selling them more add-on modules.""That is driving growth and it is why Veeva has high margins,"" Barnicle said. And ""unlike Salesforce.com (CRM), they don't have to grab new customers. They're going to the same customer and selling them more.""Gassner has key contacts from a past employer. He was senior VP of technology at Salesforce.com, charged with building its software-as-a service, or SaaS, platform.CRM Software Drives RevenueVeeva's core Customer Relationship Management, or CRM, software is built on the Salesforce.com platform.""Veeva is Salesforce.com's preferred partner for pharma and biotech,"" Gassner said. ""We are a sales channel for Salesforce.com and a partner.""CRM software accounts for about 90% of Veeva's revenue, which is expected to top $300 million this year.According to research firm Gartner, CRM software revenue worldwide grew in double digits in 2012 and 2013. Moreover, vertical or industry-specific software comprised the largest segment of the enterprise software market, at $107 billion, or 26% of the total.Most of that software is still focused on client servers rather than the cloud, or Internet, Gassner says. ""We're bringing it from client servers to the cloud. There's tremendous opportunity and we're just at the early stage of it.""Veeva's revenue in fiscal 2013 grew 111% to $129.5 million and 62% in to $210.2 million in fiscal 2014, which ended in January.Revenue in the second quarter, which ended July 31, rose 53% to $75.7 million.Net income in the quarter jumped 69% to $12.4 million, or 9 cents per share. Though the company went public in October 2013, it figured EPS in the earlier period amounted to the equivalent of 6 cents a share.Veeva's stock is up more than 40% from its IPO price of 20. After rising at first, shares dipped to 17 in May. But they rebounded sharply after Q2 results were announced on Aug. 28. That day, the company raised its forecast for the full year to $300-$303 million from $277-$282 million previously.Per-share earnings guidance for the year was upped to 30-31 cents from 26-28 cents. Analysts expect Veeva's earnings to come in at 31 cents, for a 35% gain over last year. They see growth of 23% and 32% the next two years, according to Thomson Reuters.Managing Clinical TrialsManagement said the firm made ""great progress"" in the quarter on a second product category called Veeva Vault.Veeva built its own infrastructure for Vault, which focuses on content management for processes such as clinical trials, quality management, manufacturing and sales and marketing.More than 10 new Vault customers were added in Q2, including the second top-10 drug company that signed on for Vault's clinical trial product.""It's the fastest part of the business,"" Barnicle said of Vault. Similar to how Veeva's CRM software replaces Siebel's, Vault is replacing the ""old content management systems"" used in life sciences, Barnicle says.Tracking More DataVeeva's third and newest product line is called Network, a cloud-based solution integrated into the firm's CRM platform to help customers track data on their health care customers.William Blair analysts estimate that Vault and Network offerings could expand Veeva's market opportunity from roughly $700 million to as much as $3.8 billion. The upper target was based on expansion potential of its Network database to other regions of the world beyond the U.S. and China.Veeva's largest market is in the U.S., followed by Western Europe and Asia — especially China and Japan.William Blair analysts expect Veeva's revenue to reach $1 billion by the end of 2020.Veeva is far from the only company offering health care-specific technology. But the William Blair analysts said in their recent initiation report on Veeva that the ""vast majority"" offer on-premises products or use an isolated or single-client hosting model.""We believe these legacy vendors will lose the innovation, speed to market and price battles,"" they wrote.One chief rival is Cegedim, a global tech and services firm focused on health care. Cegedim's CRM business is being acquired by IMS Health (IMS). William Blair estimates that around 40% of Cegedim's seats use on-premises technology.Gassner sees the pending acquisition as a positive for Veeva. ""There will be disruption and we will benefit from that,"" he said.

"
577,LLY,"At a medical conference in France, Biogen (BIIB) reported the results of a phase 1b study in which 166 patients were divided into five groups, one a placebo group and the others taking different doses of Biogen's drug candidate aducanumab, or BIIB-037. After 54 weeks, those in all but the lowest-dose group showed significant slowing in the decline in their cognitive function, as measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE).""Patients ... in the 3 mg/kg and the 10 mg/kg (dose arms) demonstrated an impressive slowed decline to only 0.75 and 0.58 respectively, both statistically significant,"" wrote Cowen analyst Eric Schmidt in a note Friday. ""This represents an impressive 2.39 (76%) and 2.56 (81%) point improvement on MMSE. We think Street expectations were for a 1.5-2 point improvement.""Cowen raised his price target on Biogen stock to 500 from 425. Many other analysts also raised their targets to 500 and up, though there were no upgrades for the widely buy-rated stock.Expects Launch In 2020Leerink analyst Joseph Schwartz raised his target to 532 from 475. He estimated that if Biogen penetrates even 25% to 35% of early-stage patients, the drug could pull in $14.5 billion a year worldwide at peak. That's a ways in the future, though: He's modeling a launch for 2020.The enormous sales projections are a symptom of how vast the unmet need is, for no drug on the market is able to alter the disease the way aducanumab appears to.The other leading candidate in the pipeline is Eli Lilly's (LLY) solanezumab, which brought just a 34% improvement in MMSE scores in its pooled data. Analysts pointed out, however, that the groups weren't directly comparable, since the patients in Biogen's study tilted toward earlier stages of the disease.Biogen also studied the amyloid plaques in patients' brains, which form in Alzheimer's patients and are thought to cause the symptoms, and reported a 95% reduction at the highest dose. But as the doses rose, so did the incidence of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities, or ARIAs, which raised safety concerns. At the highest dose, ARIAs affected some 41% of patients.The most serious abnormality was edema, or ARIA-E. Some 65% of patients with ARIA-E showed no symptoms, while the other 35% reported headaches, visual disturbances and confusion.Biogen said 78% of these symptoms were classified as mild to moderate, and most were resolved within four weeks.Nonetheless, about half of patients with ARIAs dropped out of the study. Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum wrote in an email to clients that this was probably why Biogen added an intermediate 6 mg dose arm to the study: ""They want to see if they can 'thread the needle' on efficacy vs. safety.""Just A Phase One TrialProbably the biggest caveat on the results, however, is that it was a phase one trial. The small size of the patient pool meant each arm had only 30 to 40 subjects, so a much larger confirmatory study is required to prove the results to regulators' satisfaction.In December, Biogen announced that it was skipping over intermediate testing and going straight to a large phase three trial, which first clued the market in to the quality of the phase one results.Other drugs, though, have failed the scale-up in testing before. Of most concern, in late December Roche (RHHBY) stopped a phase three trial of its Alzheimer's candidate gantenerumab due to futility. When talking about the planned phase three trial of aducanumab a few weeks earlier, Biogen R&D head Douglas Williams had described gantenerumab as a similar drug.Nonetheless, Biogen's success seemed to lift all boats Friday. Shares of both Lilly and Roche rose 2.6%, to 76.12 for the former and 35.17 for the latter. This may have been because the aducanumab results further support the targeting of amyloid plaques, which most of the new drugs are doing but which has not been clinically proven to work.

579,LLY,"Two of the world's biggest drugmakers issued a mixture of Q4 reports Friday in what continues to be a tough earnings season.AbbVie (ABBV) said profit excluding one-time items rose 8.5% over the year-earlier quarter to 89 cents, beating analysts' consensus by 3 cents, according to Thomson Reuters. Sales climbed 5.1% to $5.37 billion, $11 million ahead of consensus.For the full year, profit increased 5.7% to $3.32 a share, with sales gaining 6.2% to $19.96 billion.AbbVie affirmed the 2015 guidance it issued earlier this month, which called for earnings of $4.25 to $4.45 but didn't set out a revenue range.However, on the conference call with analysts, CEO Richard Gonzalez said he expects the newly launch hepatitis C combo Viekira Pak to achieve a run rate of $3 billion by the end of this year. In the midst of AbbVie's hepatitis C battle with Gilead Sciences (GILD) to land exclusive deals with payers, Gonzalez said he expects about 40% of insured patients will have access to Viekira Pak.RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee calculated that this will mean about $2 billion this year, which is below consensus of $2.8 billion.""On the positive, ABBV announced their '2nd generation' regimen (improved possible single pill w/ no booster or ribavirin) and will have data soon and plan to go to Phase III later this year. .. . This is one way they may maintain some share as an alternative to GILD,"" Yee wrote in a research note Friday.Still, AbbVie shares fell 2.7% to 61.41 in afternoon trading in the stock market today. The stock fell to a three-month low intraday of 60.12.Eli Lilly (LLY), still in the shadow of the patent cliff, reported that sales shrank 12% to $5.12 billion, missing consensus by nearly $80 million. Earnings rose 1% to 75 cents a share, beating the Street's average estimate by 2 cents.For the full year, profit dropped 33% to $2.78 a share while sales slid 15% to $19.61 billion.Lilly also affirmed its earlier profit guidance of $2.40 to $2.50 a share, but shaved $800 million off its revenue guidance, which is now $19.5 billion to $20 billion. Singing a familiar tune for this earnings season, Lilly blamed the lowered guidance ""solely to reflect the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared with several other currencies.""However, S&P Capital IQ analyst Jeffrey Loo was heartened that the EPS guidance stayed the same, as it pointed to better-than-expected gross margin. He raised his price target to 74 from 66, saying that ""2014 was the low point for sales and (we) see improving growth over the next few years.""Lilly's stock rose 0.9% to 72.73 in afternoon trading.Follow Amy Reeves on Twitter: @IBD_Areeves.

626,LLY,"Big pharmas Novartis (NVS), GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and Eli Lilly (LLY) announced a massive exchange of business units Tuesday morning in a set of deals with a total value of more than $28 billion. Novartis and Glaxo rose on the stock market today, while Lilly slipped a fraction.
"
627,LLY,"Switzerland-based Novartis agreed to buy British Glaxo's oncology business for $14.5 billion, plus up to $1.5 billion in milestone payments depending on how products in the pipeline pan out. In turn, Glaxo will pay $7.1 billion for Novartis' vaccines business. Novartis said that it's selling its flu-vaccine business separately but apparently hasn't yet found a buyer.
"
628,LLY,"The two companies also agreed to form a joint venture in consumer health care, combining their over-the-counter businesses. Novartis will own 36.5% of the JV and hold four of the 11 seats on its board.
"
629,LLY,"Meanwhile, Novartis will also sell its animal-health business to Lilly for $5.4 billion.
"
630,LLY,"In a research note, Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez wrote that this activity was not what Wall Street was expecting. There had been rumors going around in January that Novartis would sell Merck (MRK) its animal health and vaccines in exchange for Merck's over-the-counter business. But Fernandez said he liked the decision to pursue oncology instead.
"
631,LLY,"""The incremental focus the oncology transaction brings to NVS, as well as the opportunity to possibly reconsider pursuit of certain R&D efforts behind unapproved products ... is a positive financial and strategic move,"" Fernandez wrote.
"
632,LLY,"He went on to say that Glaxo was ""probably the biggest surprise participant,"" and noted that Glaxo now ""shifts toward distribution businesses (vaccines and consumer) and exits the increasingly fragmented and crowded oncology markets."" Glaxo's core business will still depend on respiratory products such as Advair, Fernandez added.
"
633,LLY,"Lilly, meanwhile, was following through on its commitment to keep its animal-health business despite some pressure from the Street to divest it. In an email to clients, ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum wrote that Novartis' veterinary unit appears to be losing money, but Lilly said that it expects to get the EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) margins for the combined business to the mid-20% range by 2018.
"

637,LLY,"RELATED: HCV Rivalry Heats Up As Merck Combo Shines.Big pharmas Novartis (NVS), GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and Eli Lilly (LLY) announced a massive exchange of business units Tuesday morning in a set of deals with a total value of more than $28 billion. Novartis and Glaxo rose on the stock market today, while Lilly slipped a fraction.Switzerland-based Novartis agreed to buy British Glaxo's oncology business for $14.5 billion, plus up to $1.5 billion in milestone payments depending on how products in the pipeline pan out. In turn, Glaxo will pay $7.1 billion for Novartis' vaccines business. Novartis said that it's selling its flu-vaccine business separately but apparently hasn't yet found a buyer.The two companies also agreed to form a joint venture in consumer health care, combining their over-the-counter businesses. Novartis will own 36.5% of the JV and hold four of the 11 seats on its board.Meanwhile, Novartis will also sell its animal-health business to Lilly for $5.4 billion.In a research note, Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez wrote that this activity was not what Wall Street was expecting. There had been rumors going around in January that Novartis would sell Merck (MRK) its animal health and vaccines in exchange for Merck's over-the-counter business. But Fernandez said he liked the decision to pursue oncology instead.""The incremental focus the oncology transaction brings to NVS, as well as the opportunity to possibly reconsider pursuit of certain R&D efforts behind unapproved products ... is a positive financial and strategic move,"" Fernandez wrote.He went on to say that Glaxo was ""probably the biggest surprise participant,"" and noted that Glaxo now ""shifts toward distribution businesses (vaccines and consumer) and exits the increasingly fragmented and crowded oncology markets."" Glaxo's core business will still depend on respiratory products such as Advair, Fernandez added.Lilly, meanwhile, was following through on its commitment to keep its animal-health business despite some pressure from the Street to divest it. In an email to clients, ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum wrote that Novartis' veterinary unit appears to be losing money, but Lilly said that it expects to get the EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) margins for the combined business to the mid-20% range by 2018.""We suspect LLY shareholders won't be 'inspired' by LLY's decision to buy an animal-health company (shareholders always want big companies to buy a biotech growth engine — easier said than done, though),"" Schoenebaum wrote. ""However, Elanco (Lilly's animal-health unit) has been a story of success inside LLY, so shareholders are likely to give management the benefit of the doubt on the deal.""Novartis' U.S. stock was up 1%, near 85.50, in morning trading Tuesday.

""The Reporting Persons acquired their positions in the Shares in the belief that they were undervalued,"" stated the Schedule 13D filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. ""The Reporting Persons intend to have conversations with members of (Hologic's) management to discuss ways to enhance shareholder value.""
"
682,LLY,"Analysts say that, with investor unhappiness reaching critical levels after a string of missed quarters, now might be a good time for the sort of aggressive intervention for which Icahn is known. In the last five years, he's helped engineer the sale of ImClone to Eli Lilly (LLY) and MedImmune to AstraZeneca (AZN).

686,LLY,"Fueled by the obesity epidemic and an aging population, diabetes has become a global problem.
"
687,LLY,"It affects an estimated 380 million people worldwide, 27 million in the U.S. But for drug companies, it's an opportunity.
"
688,LLY,"Denmark's Novo Nordisk (NVO) is a leading player in the market. Unlike chief rivals Eli Lilly (LLY) and Sanofi (SNY), which target many other diseases, Novo Nordisk focuses mostly on diabetes therapies.
"
689,LLY,"That sharp focus is a competitive advantage, says Ronny Gal, analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.
"
690,LLY,"""They have very good technical skills, and they spend a lot of money on sales and marketing,"" he said.
"
691,LLY,"Karen Andersen, an analyst with Morningstar, calls Novo Nordisk ""the most innovative player in diabetes.""
"
692,LLY,"But Novo Nordisk got off to a slow start this year. First-quarter sales were hurt in the U.S. as pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts (ESRX) removed three of the company's top drugs from its preferred provider list in favor of drugs with lower prices from Eli Lilly and AstraZeneca (AZN).
"
693,LLY,"Analysts expect 2015 and 2016 to look healthier as Novo Nordisk benefits from price hikes and new drug launches. In May, it raised prices on insulin drugs by 10%.
"
694,LLY,"Growth Estimates
"
695,LLY,"""When you have a growing market and take pricing, you typically have a good business,"" Gal said.
"
696,LLY,"Morningstar estimates that the global diabetes market will grow 12% a year over the next five years.
"
697,LLY,"""Even if pricing power weakens, (Novo Nordisk) will see strong growth over the long run,"" Andersen said.
"
698,LLY,"She says growth in the U.S. is driven by increased diagnosis rates and patients moving to newer and pricier therapies. In emerging markets such as China and Mexico, the growth potential is rooted more in richer diets and less exercise as people move from rural to urban areas. Obesity is one of the biggest risk factors for developing diabetes.
"
699,LLY,"Andersen expects the impact from the Express Scripts decision to linger through the year.
"
700,LLY,"The three drugs cut from the preferred list were NovoLog, the firm's best-selling insulin drug in the U.S., NovoLog Mix and non-insulin drug Victoza.
"
701,LLY,"Sales of Victoza, in a class known as GLP-1, had been growing at double-digit rates. But first-quarter sales slowed, to $535 million from $587 million in the fourth quarter, though they were still 9% higher than a year earlier.
"
702,LLY,"Foreign-exchange head winds didn't help, nor did industrywide inventory cuts by U.S. wholesalers. Also, the company faced generic competition for Prandin, its blood-sugar-lowering oral drug.
"
703,LLY,"Not only did Novo Nordisk miss sales forecasts in Q1, it lowered its forecast for the full year for the first time in a decade.
"
704,LLY,"Revenue in the quarter grew just 2% in Danish kroners to the equivalent of $3.73 billion, or 7% in local currencies.
"
705,LLY,"The new forecast for 2014 calls for 7% to 10% growth vs. 8% to 11% previously.
"
706,LLY,"The quarter's sales results broke a streak of 47 straight quarters of double-digit top-line growth, says Kasper Poulsen, head of investor relations.
"
707,LLY,"""We knew there would be a head wind in Q1,"" he said. But he says the company was ""surprised by how fast Express Scripts implemented the (preferred provider) change,"" which went into effect Jan. 1. It took just one month rather than the typical two to three, he said.
"
708,LLY,"The bottom line fared better. Novo Nordisk earned 45 cents a share in the first quarter, a penny above views, and up 10% from the earlier year.
"
709,LLY,"Gross margin (83%) and operating profit (39.5%) were up 3% and 6%, respectively.
"
710,LLY,"Still, analysts expect per-share profit growth in American depositary receipts to slow this year to 11% from 25% last year. Revenue is seen climbing 7.5% to $16 billion.
"
711,LLY,"As efforts in the U.S. to cut health costs continue, ""The big risk is that people begin to push back (on prices),"" Gal said.
"

713,LLY,"The company's new-generation insulin drug Tresiba has been launched in 12 countries outside the U.S., including the U.K., Germany and Japan. Approval in the U.S. will depend on results of a new clinical trial.
"
714,LLY,"The Food and Drug Administration asked for more data on heart risks for the long-acting insulin product.

715,LLY,"Novo Nordisk says the U.S. trial is progressing ahead of plan and expects to have enough data by mid-2015 to support an interim analysis.
"
716,LLY,"U.S. Launch
"
717,LLY,"If Tresiba shows positive data from the trial, as analysts widely expect, it would bode well for a U.S. launch as early as 2016.
"
718,LLY,"""Tresiba would help to extend their growth and renew their insulin portfolio,"" said Andersen, who expects the drug to generate $3.5 billion by 2023.
"
719,LLY,"Tresiba is an ""improved version of Levemir"" and has ""better pricing power,"" Andersen said.
"
720,LLY,"Tresiba has patent protection through 2028 vs. Levemir's 2019.
"
721,LLY,"Levemir competes with Sanofi's Lantus. Both modern insulin drugs are growing at a robust clip, and are different enough from each other to maintain pricing power, she says.
"
722,LLY,"Lantus will likely see competition in 2016 from a biosimilar drug.
"
723,LLY,"Tresiba's launch in the U.S. would leave both Levemir and Lantus behind as older-generation products more likely to do better in emerging markets, Andersen says.
"
724,LLY,"Novo Nordisk's pipeline includes a combination drug of Tresiba and Victoza, called Xultophy, which could launch in Europe around the new year, pending regulatory approval. A drug to treat obesity is under review by the FDA and by officials in Europe.
"
725,LLY,"Data from other trials are due out next year, including a faster-acting version of NovoLog. An oral GLP-1 class drug is also in development.
"
726,LLY,"""While we expect 2014 to be low on events, we believe 2015 is likely to bring some of the most important events for Novo Nordisk,"" analyst Peter Hugreffe of Stockholm-based SEB Equity Research said in a recent research report.Fueled by the obesity epidemic and an aging population, diabetes has become a global problem.It affects an estimated 380 million people worldwide, 27 million in the U.S. But for drug companies, it's an opportunity.Denmark's Novo Nordisk (NVO) is a leading player in the market. Unlike chief rivals Eli Lilly (LLY) and Sanofi (SNY), which target many other diseases, Novo Nordisk focuses mostly on diabetes therapies.That sharp focus is a competitive advantage, says Ronny Gal, analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.""They have very good technical skills, and they spend a lot of money on sales and marketing,"" he said.Karen Andersen, an analyst with Morningstar, calls Novo Nordisk ""the most innovative player in diabetes.""But Novo Nordisk got off to a slow start this year. First-quarter sales were hurt in the U.S. as pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts (ESRX) removed three of the company's top drugs from its preferred provider list in favor of drugs with lower prices from Eli Lilly and AstraZeneca (AZN).Analysts expect 2015 and 2016 to look healthier as Novo Nordisk benefits from price hikes and new drug launches. In May, it raised prices on insulin drugs by 10%.Growth Estimates""When you have a growing market and take pricing, you typically have a good business,"" Gal said.Morningstar estimates that the global diabetes market will grow 12% a year over the next five years.""Even if pricing power weakens, (Novo Nordisk) will see strong growth over the long run,"" Andersen said.She says growth in the U.S. is driven by increased diagnosis rates and patients moving to newer and pricier therapies. In emerging markets such as China and Mexico, the growth potential is rooted more in richer diets and less exercise as people move from rural to urban areas. Obesity is one of the biggest risk factors for developing diabetes.Andersen expects the impact from the Express Scripts decision to linger through the year.The three drugs cut from the preferred list were NovoLog, the firm's best-selling insulin drug in the U.S., NovoLog Mix and non-insulin drug Victoza.Sales of Victoza, in a class known as GLP-1, had been growing at double-digit rates. But first-quarter sales slowed, to $535 million from $587 million in the fourth quarter, though they were still 9% higher than a year earlier.Foreign-exchange head winds didn't help, nor did industrywide inventory cuts by U.S. wholesalers. Also, the company faced generic competition for Prandin, its blood-sugar-lowering oral drug.Not only did Novo Nordisk miss sales forecasts in Q1, it lowered its forecast for the full year for the first time in a decade.Revenue in the quarter grew just 2% in Danish kroners to the equivalent of $3.73 billion, or 7% in local currencies.The new forecast for 2014 calls for 7% to 10% growth vs. 8% to 11% previously.The quarter's sales results broke a streak of 47 straight quarters of double-digit top-line growth, says Kasper Poulsen, head of investor relations.""We knew there would be a head wind in Q1,"" he said. But he says the company was ""surprised by how fast Express Scripts implemented the (preferred provider) change,"" which went into effect Jan. 1. It took just one month rather than the typical two to three, he said.The bottom line fared better. Novo Nordisk earned 45 cents a share in the first quarter, a penny above views, and up 10% from the earlier year.Gross margin (83%) and operating profit (39.5%) were up 3% and 6%, respectively.Still, analysts expect per-share profit growth in American depositary receipts to slow this year to 11% from 25% last year. Revenue is seen climbing 7.5% to $16 billion.As efforts in the U.S. to cut health costs continue, ""The big risk is that people begin to push back (on prices),"" Gal said.Poulsen says increased pressure to contain costs could result in higher rebates, making it more important to come out with differentiated products.The company's new-generation insulin drug Tresiba has been launched in 12 countries outside the U.S., including the U.K., Germany and Japan.

"
728,LLY,"When big biotechs Amgen and Regeneron launched their new cholesterol drugs Repatha and Praluent this summer, Wall Street uniformly predicted blockbuster sales, though they debated just how big.
"
729,LLY,"After all, one in seven adult Americans have high cholesterol, and Pfizer's (PFE) Lipitor was the biggest-selling drug in the world before it went off patent in 2011 and got generic rivals.
"
730,LLY,"Yet the statins — the drug class to which Lipitor belongs — aren't enough for everyone. Repatha and Praluent, both in a new class called PCSK9 inhibitors, promise to help many of those people whose cholesterol is still too high.
"
731,LLY,"In mid-September, Amgen (AMGN) made an acquisition that signaled where the future might lie. The company agreed to pay $300 million upfront for Dezima Pharma, a company developing a drug called a cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitor. That drug class, which is also being developed by Merck (MRK) and Eli Lilly (LLY), also promises to lower cholesterol for those inadequately treated by statins. But besides lowering LDL bad cholesterol, they've also shown the ability to raise HDL good cholesterol.
"
732,LLY,"In contrast to the biweekly injections required for Amgen's and Regeneron's (REGN) treatments, the CETPs can be taken in one daily pill.
"
733,LLY,"If Dezima's drug candidate succeeds, Amgen is on the hook for up to $1.25 billion in milestone payments. But that could be well worth it if the CETP class turns out to be a real threat.
"
734,LLY,"""It provides a natural hedge on Amgen's important cardiovascular franchise, given PCSK9 Repatha could be a $4 billion-to-$5 billion drug but is injectable, while Phase III competitor CETP inhibitors from Lilly and Merck are oral,"" wrote RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee in a research note on Sept. 16, the day the deal was announced.
"
735,LLY,"For Wall Street, success is a big if. The drug in the class to first make it to phase-three testing, Pfizer's torcetrapib, came to a screeching halt when Pfizer realized the drug was raising patients' death rate by increasing their blood pressure.
"
736,LLY,"""It really shook up the field, because there were high hopes for torcetrapib,"" Daniel Bloomfield, vice president of clinical research in Merck's cardiovascular program, told IBD. ""When they announced their results, we put our program on hold and started to work through some of the issues.""
"
737,LLY,"Bloomfield said Merck isolated the hormone that was responsible for raising blood pressure in Pfizer's trial, and could demonstrate that its own drug, anacetrapib, did not have that risk factor. Lilly also says it's confident its CETP inhibitor, evacetrapib, is safer than its predecessor.
"
738,LLY,"""We enrolled our first patient in 2012, and we have 12,000 patients, most of (whom) are many, many months on treatment without any evidence of a safety signal,"" said Jeffrey Riesmeyer, senior medical director of Lilly's cardiovascular program.
"
739,LLY,"At the same time, though, there's a danger of making the drug too weak. That happened with Roche's (RHHBY) CETP inhibitor dalcetrapib. Its phase-three trial showed no safety problems, but it raised HDL by only 30% — where other candidates have typically raised it in the triple digits — and it didn't affect LDL at all.
"
740,LLY,"This history is the reason PCSK9s are available now, while the CETP inhibitors won't be on the market for at least two years. Amgen and Regeneron were able to win approval on the basis of their cholesterol-lowering powers before the companies demonstrated the drugs' effect on overall cardiovascular health. Both Merck and Lilly, however, are going to complete their cardiovascular outcome studies before they apply for approval.
"
741,LLY,"""When we first started working on anacetrapib, we had alignment with the FDA that they would approve the drug based on LDL lowering,"" Bloomfield said. ""I think (now) the FDA wants to see evidence of outcomes benefit before they approve a drug in this class. I think we want to see it as well, given that shadow overhanging the mechanism.""
"
742,LLY,"Lilly's trial is expected to be done by mid-2016, and Merck's by early 2017, which is also when the PCSK9 data are expected to start coming in. Both companies are studying similar patient groups to those in the PCSK9 trials — mainly those who already have heart disease. Virtually all of them are already on statins and many of them are also taking diabetes medicines, Riesmeyer notes.
"
743,LLY,"Since Lilly's diabetes drug Jardiance was recently shown to improve heart health by itself, the two drugs might work in tandem, Riesmeyer notes.
"
744,LLY,"The main difference between the two drugs is that Merck's anacetrapib has a longer half-life, or time that the drug remains in the body — traces of the drug have been detected in patients up to four years after their last dose. Lilly's Riesmeyer points to this as a potential safety issue, though that has yet to be proved.
"
745,LLY,"So far, the CETP inhibitors' ability to lower LDL has lagged behind the PCSK9s. In its phase-three trial, Praluent reduced LDL by 58%, and Repatha performed similarly. Anacetripib and evacetrapib have lowered it 20% to 40%, though they've also raised HDL as much as 140%. Dezima's drug TA-8995, which has gone through phase two, lowered LDL 40% to 50% while raising HDL 160%, which Amgen advertised when it announced the deal.
"
746,LLY,"""Assuming the LDL hypothesis holds true for CETP's, TA-8995 may potentially be best-in-class,"" wrote Leerink analysts in a July 8 deep-dive report on the cholesterol market.
"
747,LLY,"The uncertainty about the exact connection between cholesterol and heart health leaves it unclear just how this could translate to market share. And Merck's Bloomfield says that will likely be the key factor.
"
748,LLY,"""That's not to say the magnitude of the benefit, the safety and tolerability profile, and the price vs. generics aren't going to be important,"" he said. ""All four of those factors would be important, but I would expect that outcomes would be the required entry into taking significant market share.""When big biotechs Amgen and Regeneron launched their new cholesterol drugs Repatha and Praluent this summer, Wall Street uniformly predicted blockbuster sales, though they debated just how big.After all, one in seven adult Americans have high cholesterol, and Pfizer's (PFE) Lipitor was the biggest-selling drug in the world before it went off patent in 2011 and got generic rivals.Yet the statins — the drug class to which Lipitor belongs — aren't enough for everyone.

"
762,LLY,"And so - let the confessions begin - or not......Yesterday - Citron Research - a firm that publishes negative research and actively makes bets against companies - made some very high-profile allegations against Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) using phrases like - ""web of deception"", ""Fraud"", calling it the ENRON of the pharmaceutical industry.....Now for those of us who actually remember the ENRON scandal - that was not good.... and or those of you who do not - let me outline it....
"
763,LLY,"At the height of its 'season' Enron was an energy, commodity and pulp and paper services company based in Houston, TX. Ticker symbol on the NYSE was ENE and it was one of the most actively traded stocks at the time.....Everyone wanted to be 'in' ENRON.....there was always a big crowd, big trades, lots of action.....Just the name caused your blood to pump and your brow to sweat.........and it was right outside of my booth... ..so the energy and excitement was never far away...... It was a company that claimed to have $100 bil. in revenues in 2000 and for 6 consecutive years was named one of ""America's Most Innovative Companies"" by Fortune magazine..... and then in December 2001 - they filed for bankruptcy and it all went POOF!
"
764,LLY,"Rumors had been building for weeks, questions raised, stories written....but remember - there was NO Internet, no Facebook, no Twitter.....so the news moved a bit slower....but it moved just the same....and then it was revealed...that all of that money and supposed financial condition......was nothing but a fraud.......I will never forget the action on the floor of the NYSE at the time - the stock crashed, dozens of brokers, vying for position, the roar of the market at work....the energy, the excitement, the tension, it was a broker's dream......it was the very definition of the functionality of the exchange....it was the very core, the heart and soul of capitalism........ and so today when something or someone is ENRON-like - it is accusing them of fraudulent and corruptive behavior....It is essentially a death knell......
"
765,LLY,"At about 10:13 am yesterday - the headline hit Twitter - Citron Research was calling 'VRX the pharmaceutical ENRON ' and the rest is history.....The stock crashed - Now the stock fell 30% in 30 mins......only to rally and then fall another 18% by 1:30.....Then Bill Ackman (large shareholder) comes out and announces that he was buying 2 mil more shares....and the company defends itself saying that the report is 'erroneous full of false and misleading statements'......""We categorically deny the allegations"".....Oh boy.....Now it's gonna get interesting..... The stock closed last night at $118.61 (down 28% on the day) and this morning in the pre-market , the stock is trading at $117...this is a story that is far from over.....so sit down and pay attention.....One day there will be a book written about this....
"
766,LLY,"So - that was all the excitement yesterday - pharma and healthcare - and that managed to cast a pall over the broader market...... The decline added to the market's losses from Tuesday and came on top of crude oil price weakness and investors focusing on the latest wave of companies reporting quarterly financial results. The lower close reflected ongoing concerns about corporate earnings and the outlook for the global economy. Now yes BA, and UTX did help to push industrial names higher but the broader market suffered under the negative tone created by the action in VRX and a buildup in oil reserves.......
"
767,LLY,"A DOE (Dept. of Energy) report showed an 8.0 mil barrel inventory build in crude oil, which is the highest weekly inventory build since April 3rd and dramatically higher than what was expected - this caused oil prices to fall $1.09 closing at $45.20. We are still holding within the range ($43/$50), but are now worried if the intermediate-term is looking more and more challenging as supplies continue to build. This morning - oil is trading up a bit - so the churn remains.
"
768,LLY,"As we have noted this is the one to keep your eyes on...a breach below $43 a barrel will bring more selling in the market despite all of the chatter that the Fed governors might say.
"
769,LLY,"Weak earnings continue to pressure stocks....and because earnings expectations have been lowered, when a company beats its expectations it doesn't necessary mean we're expanding - it just means that they beat lowered estimates - just like when you buy or sell a stock in pico seconds - it does NOT mean you did a good job...it just means you did it fast....
"
770,LLY,"So now 3rd quarter earnings for the S&P are coming in slightly better than expected....analysts are now calling for a 4.8% decline in profits - better than the original 7% decline they had prepared us for - this because 70% have beaten the estimate while only 40% are beating the top line.....(disconnect) .....Now 9 of the 10 sectors in the S&P 500 moved lower yesterday. Energy stocks fell the most on the back of weaker oil, industrials the only sector to rise thanks to BA and UTX......

Ticker symbol on the NYSE was ENE and it was one of the most actively traded stocks at the time.....Everyone wanted to be 'in' ENRON.....there was always a big crowd, big trades, lots of action.....Just the name caused your blood to pump and your brow to sweat.........and it was right outside of my booth... ..so the energy and excitement was never far away...... It was a company that claimed to have $100 bil. in revenues in 2000 and for 6 consecutive years was named one of ""America's Most Innovative Companies"" by Fortune magazine..... and then in December 2001 - they filed for bankruptcy and it all went POOF!Rumors had been building for weeks, questions raised, stories written....but remember - there was NO Internet, no Facebook, no Twitter.....so the news moved a bit slower....but it moved just the same....and then it was revealed...that all of that money and supposed financial condition......was nothing but a fraud.......I will never forget the action on the floor of the NYSE at the time - the stock crashed, dozens of brokers, vying for position, the roar of the market at work....the energy, the excitement, the tension, it was a broker's dream......it was the very definition of the functionality of the exchange....it was the very core, the heart and soul of capitalism........ and so today when something or someone is ENRON-like - it is accusing them of fraudulent and corruptive behavior....It is essentially a death knell......At about 10:13 am yesterday - the headline hit Twitter - Citron Research was calling 'VRX the pharmaceutical ENRON ' and the rest is history.....The stock crashed - Now the stock fell 30% in 30 mins......only to rally and then fall another 18% by 1:30.....Then Bill Ackman (large shareholder) comes out and announces that he was buying 2 mil more shares....and the company defends itself saying that the report is 'erroneous full of false and misleading statements'......""We categorically deny the allegations"".....Oh boy.....Now it's gonna get interesting..... The stock closed last night at $118.61 (down 28% on the day) and this morning in the pre-market , the stock is trading at $117...this is a story that is far from over.....so sit down and pay attention.....One day there will be a book written about this....So - that was all the excitement yesterday - pharma and healthcare - and that managed to cast a pall over the broader market...... The decline added to the market's losses from Tuesday and came on top of crude oil price weakness and investors focusing on the latest wave of companies reporting quarterly financial results. The lower close reflected ongoing concerns about corporate earnings and the outlook for the global economy. Now yes BA, and UTX did help to push industrial names higher but the broader market suffered under the negative tone created by the action in VRX and a buildup in oil reserves.......A DOE (Dept. of Energy) report showed an 8.0 mil barrel inventory build in crude oil, which is the highest weekly inventory build since April 3rd and dramatically higher than what was expected - this caused oil prices to fall $1.09 closing at $45.20. We are still holding within the range ($43/$50), but are now worried if the intermediate-term is looking more and more challenging as supplies continue to build. This morning - oil is trading up a bit - so the churn remains.As we have noted this is the one to keep your eyes on...a breach below $43 a barrel will bring more selling in the market despite all of the chatter that the Fed governors might say.Weak earnings continue to pressure stocks....and because earnings expectations have been lowered, when a company beats its expectations it doesn't necessary mean we're expanding - it just means that they beat lowered estimates - just like when you buy or sell a stock in pico seconds - it does NOT mean you did a good job...it just means you did it fast....So now 3rd quarter earnings for the S&P are coming in slightly better than expected....analysts are now calling for a 4.8% decline in profits - better than the original 7% decline they had prepared us for - this because 70% have beaten the estimate while only 40% are beating the top line.....(disconnect) .....Now 9 of the 10 sectors in the S&P 500 moved lower yesterday. Energy stocks fell the most on the back of weaker oil, industrials the only sector to rise thanks to BA and UTX......More earnings to come today.. MCD, CAT, and MMM all report prior to the open.....some have already reported and they have been positive.....SWK, Alaska Air, LLY, LUV, DOW, AEP, RTN, UA.. - all showing bottom line beats....and pre-market trading has most of these names moving higher.... After the bell look for Alphabet (Goog), AMZN, MSFT and T..... Eco data today includes - Inti Jobless Claims of 265k, Cont Claims of 2.18 mil, Existing Home Sales of 5.39 mil, and M/M of +1.5% - Kansas City Fed to show lower activity at -9.....European markets are all slightly higher as they await the ECB rate news....No one expects that Draghi will change rates but will in fact leave the door open to further easing.....

783,LLY,"At the American Association for Cancer Research meeting on Sunday, Pfizer presented final results from its phase-two trial of palbo in patients with metastatic breast cancer. As IBD reported last month, investors were greatly interested in the presentation after an interim analysis in 2012 showed a massive progression-free survival benefit. The question was whether Pfizer could translate that into an overall-survival benefit.
"
784,LLY,"In Sunday's presentation of the Paloma-1 trial, the PFS benefit was somewhat smaller but still substantial — 10.2 months, compared with 18.6 months in the interim analysis. The overall-survival benefit was 4.2 months, but that was not statistically significant.
"
785,LLY,"Analyst Mark Schoenebaum of ISI Group pointed out that since the study enrolled fewer than 200 patients, it would have been very difficult to produce a statistically significant overall-survival, or OS, benefit. The company plans to launch a larger phase-three trial that might yet score. But Sunday's news seemed to sink hopes that Pfizer would file on phase-two data alone.
"
786,LLY,"""To be honest, the message around FDA filing timelines was a bit confusing during the call,"" Schoenebaum wrote Sunday after a conference call with Pfizer and other analysts. ""During the prepared remarks, they said they can 'envision' a filing based on phase 2 data, which got me quite excited (I'm an old man now, and thus stuff like this easily excites me). However, during the Q&A they seemed to back away from proclaiming any certainty around whether the phase 2 alone will be sufficient.""
"
787,LLY,"Leerink Swann analyst Seamus Fernandez said that he was skeptical the FDA would approve palbo without at least interim data from a phase-three trial. ""PFE reported a total of 30 vs. 31 deaths and median OS of 37.5 months vs. 33.3 months (HR=0.81; p=0.21), suggesting a directionally positive but modest effect for admittedly immature OS data in this patient population,"" he wrote in a research note Monday.

790,LLY,"""As a reminder, LLY has argued that their drug might work better because it can be dosed continuously (vs. Palbo's 3 weeks on, 1 week off regimen) due to less severe neutropenia,"" Schoenebaum wrote.

"
794,LLY,"Novo made 45 cents a share in the quarter, up about 10% over the year-earlier quarter in Danish kroner, and a penny above analysts' consensus. Sales increased 2% in kroner to the equivalent of $3.73 billion, missing consensus of $3.97 billion.

812,LLY,"Shares of Eli Lilly (LLY) jumped to a more than 14-year high Thursday as the company presented more evidence that its diabetes drug Jardiance reduces death from heart failure.At the annual European Association for the Study of Diabetes, Lilly and partner Boehringer Ingelheim presented details on the massive Empa-Reg Outcome Trial studying the long-term cardiovascular effects of Jardiance, which they first headlined last month. Lilly and Ingelheim reported that Jardiance reduced death by cardiovascular causes by 38% — although oddly enough, it did not reduce the risk of nonfatal heart attack and stroke. All-cause mortality was cut by 32%, while hospitalizations for heart failure were down 35%.Lilly noted that Jardiance was the first diabetes drug to show this kind of effect.""Addressing the burden of cardiovascular events, including death, is at the core of diabetes care, and until now no single diabetes medication has been associated with a reduction in mortality,"" lead investigator Bernard Zinman said in a statement.Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum reported that the slides from the study generated applause at the meeting. He also noted that it has larger implications in the field of diabetes care. Jardiance is an SGLT2 inhibitor, the same class of drug as Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) Invokana and AstraZeneca's (AZN) Farxiga.On the other hand, Merck's (MRK) similar outcomes study of its Januvia, a drug in a different class called DPP4 inhibitors, did not find a cardiovascular benefit, though it didn't do any harm either.""Based on these data, I think the SGLT2 class is likely to be bigger than the DPP4 class in 3-6 years,"" Schoenebaum wrote in an email to clients. ""Remember, every $1 billion (per year) in additional sales adds $0.25 to Lilly EPS. Peak sales estimates are currently under $2 billion. Merck sells $6 billion of Januvia today. These could invert.""Schoenebaum added that J&J and AstraZeneca are also conducting outcomes studies on the SGLT2 inhibitors — with results due in 2017 and 2019, respectively — that should give a clearer idea of whether this is a class effect.The new data were announced just before noon ET Thursday, sending Lilly stock up nearly 7% to above 90 later Thursday afternoon. Merck stock was down more than 1% in afternoon trading in the stock market today.Follow Amy Reeves on Twitter @IBD_Areeves and Facebook.

813,LLY,"Hillary Clinton has promoted her drug pricing plan as a way to take on an industry she says is guilty of ""outrageous"" prices. But it's her friends in the media who could take the hit.While Clinton's plan wouldn't go as far as some have suggested in banning consumer-directed drug advertising, she would, in effect, tax advertising dollars as if they were after-tax profits.The hope is that doing so would restrain unnecessary prescription drug spending because patients wouldn't ask their doctor if they should be trying out some wonder-cure they learned about on TV, or reading a newspaper.""This would ostensibly decrease pharma ad spending in order to make branded drugs less prevalent in the minds of consumers over cheaper generics,"" wrote Cowen & Co. health care analyst Charles Rhee.An even more certain result would be a hit to media-company profits — or an expansion of their losses.Last year, drugmakers spent $3.2 billion on TV ads, $1.2 billion on magazine ads and $127 million on newspaper ads, according to Kantar Media. Pfizer (PFE) spent more than $1 billion on ads, roughly the same as the combined total of the next three biggest advertisers AbbVie (ABBV), Eli Lilly (LLY) and AstraZeneca (AZN).Yet, Rhee wrote, ""even if the overall pie were to shrink, we think more of the ad pie would shift in favor of digital advertisers in an even accelerated manner as advertisers seek greater return on investment.""In particular, Rhee names WebMD (WBMD) and Everyday Health (EVDY) as potential winners in this scenario, though he sees it as unlikely to come to pass under a Republican-dominated Congress.Still, maybe there's hope that Hillary's plan would help her great friends in the blogosphere.

At the same time, however, Lilly said it had conducted a futility analysis of its phase-three trial and the results were encouraging enough to continue. Results are expected early next year.

In that period, out of 154 sector ETFs tracked by IBD, the top 10 each targeted the health sector.In fact, now more than ever, with biotech and pharma ETFs trading as much as 25% below their 52-week highs, S&P Capital IQ sees a buying opportunity in solid biotech names such as Gilead (GILD) and Celgene (CELG), an IBD 50 stock.Nearly 11.7 million people are newly insured through ObamaCare health exchanges, the firm noted in a recent report. That should drive sales for health care providers and services. A strong dollar is likely to weigh on large-cap pharmaceuticals, but the Big Four — Pfizer (PFE), Merck (MRK), Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and Eli Lilly (LLY) — should ""once again post top-line growth in 2016 for the first time in five years as they pass the patent cliff,"" the report said.Plus, the health care index is nicely valued vs. its 15-year average.""Upside is especially attainable"" within the biotech, pharma and equipment subindustries, the report added.The big upside potential has seen sometimes-risky biotech and drug stocks make their way into many investors' ETF strategies. But now, with China and a global slowdown on their minds, investors are more focused on downside risk.They may be right to be cautious.""While value stocks are at risk should economic growth estimates continue to come down, momentum companies are exposed to more spikes in volatility,"" which has weighed on biotechs lately, Russ Koesterich, global chief investment strategist at BlackRock, wrote recently.He suggested investors consider quality stocks — ""which generally have strong return on equity and low debt"" — for successful investing if the markets stay choppy.Analysts at BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research agree.In a new report, they say health care rates as the most attractive sector based on measures that have historically been best at predicting results, such as EPS and sales revisions, guidance and the prior quarter's results.Stick with health care to stick with quality, BofA Merrill Lynch advised.

885,LLY,"Specialty-drug giant and IBD 50 stock Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) agreed to pay big pharma AstraZeneca (AZN) up to $445 million in a licensing deal for a psoriasis drug candidate that had proved effective but also shown a suicide risk in clinical trials.
"
886,LLY,"Valeant agreed to pay AstraZeneca $100 million upfront for brodalumab, and committed up to $170 million in prelaunch milestones and $175 million in sales milestones. As phase three studies in psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and axial spondyloarthritis have already been completed on the drug, Valeant said it plans to file for FDA approval in Q4.
"
887,LLY,"""We are delighted we were able to reach a licensing agreement with AstraZeneca to commercialize brodalumab, which is potentially the most efficacious therapy yet for moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis,"" Valeant CEO Michael Pearson said in a statement. ""We remain fully committed to dermatology and will continue to advance our pipeline of internally developed and acquired products.""
"
888,LLY,"What Valeant's press release didn't mention is that AstraZeneca's previous partner in brodalumab, Amgen (AMGN), had abandoned the program back in May when several patients in the clinical trials killed themselves. Though the numbers were small compared with the 3,180 subjects who'd gone through the trials, Amgen concluded that the label would be too restrictive to be worth its continued investment.
"
889,LLY,"Novartis, Lilly Have IL-17s
"
890,LLY,"Amgen's reasoning was no doubt influenced by the fact that brodalumab will face a crowded field. Brodalumab is one of a new class called IL-17 antibodies, which includes Novartis' (NVS) recently approved Cosentyx and Eli Lilly 's (LLY) still-in-development ixekizumab. Neither has shown a suicide risk in trials.
"
891,LLY,"In January, Valeant acquired Dendreon, maker of innovative but underperforming cancer drug Provenge after that company went bankrupt. Last month it picked up Sprout Pharmaceuticals, maker of the much-publicized but risky female-libido pill Addyi.
"
892,LLY,"""It's very Valeant-esque in many ways,"" Evercore ISI analyst Umer Raffat wrote of the brodalumab deal in an email to clients. ""Picking up an abandoned biopharma asset. Also signals Valeant's increased interest in launch-ready assets (and hence, continued 'organic growth'). Recall recent deals like Salix (IBS-D launch), Sprout (Addyi launch) and now this IL-17 ahead of FDA filing.""
"
893,LLY,"Raffat noted that Valeant committed little money upfront for an entree into a large market — $5 billion a year for psoriasis alone. Cosentyx is already annualizing $300 million in sales in just its sixth month, in an industry where drugs typically take years to hit their peak sales.
"
894,LLY,"Nonetheless, Valeant stock was down 3% in early trading in the stock market today, near 224, as the stock market in general got off to a poor start. AstraZeneca stock was down 1.5%, near 31.

896,LLY,"Big pharma Eli Lilly (LLY) said Wednesday that its drug candidate ramucirumab improved the survival of lung-cancer patients in a late-stage study. Lilly stock gapped up 3% in early trading on the stock market today.
"
897,LLY,"The study looked at patients with metastatics non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who had failed a previous round of platinum-based chemotherapy. One group of patients took standard cancer drug docetaxel (best known as Sanofi's (SNY) Taxotere) with a placebo, while another took docetaxel with ramucirumab. The company said the ramucirumab group showed a significant improvement in progression-free survival, though exactly how much improvement won't be revealed until an unspecified scientific meeting in the future.
"
898,LLY,"Another piece of data the firm didn't yet reveal was the survival rate of patients with the squamous form of NSCLC vs. those with non-squamous. This is potentially significant because one of the most popular lung-cancer drugs today, Roche's (RHHBY) Avastin, cannot be used on squamous patients, potentially leaving a market opportunity open.
"
899,LLY,"""Assuming ram works in the nonsquamous setting only, we get to peak sales of about $750 million worldwide,"" ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum wrote in an email to clients. ""This assumes 35% penetration, Avastin pricing, 4 months duration of therapy and 40% price discount in the EU. Squamous population represents about 1/3 of all NSCLC patients, and that market is wide open, so the drug if it works in squamous as well (sales) could top $1 billion.""
"
900,LLY,"Since current consensus is calling for peak annual sales of less than $1 billion, including expected approvals for gastric, colorectal and liver cancer, that represents quite a potential upside, Schoenebaum pointed out.
"
901,LLY,"Needham analyst Serge Belanger said this is also good news for biotech Dyax (DYAX), which through a licensing deal will get a 1% to 3% royalty on the drug. Dyax stock was up 2.5% to a nine-year high just below 10 in early trading Wednesday.

907,LLY,"European markets rallied despite signs that Thursday's agreement between Russia, Europe and the U.S. to ease rising tension in Ukraine was faltering. On Tuesday, Ukraine ordered resumption of anti-terror operations.
"
908,LLY,"The massive and complex deal between Swiss drug giant Novartis (NVS) and the U.K.'s GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) was a centerpiece for the session. The two companies effectively restructured in a single swap. Novartis bought GlaxoSmithKline's oncology unit for $14.5 billion. GlaxoSmithKline grabbed Novartis vaccine business for $7.1 billion.

Not all insurers cover sexual-performance treatments.Anthem (ANTM) has put Addyi on its third tier, as it has put Viagra and Eli Lilly's (LLY) Cialis, offering some reimbursement but not as much as its preferred drugs.Other insurers and pharmacy benefit managers have said that they're still thinking about it.""The high level of uncertainty around this product seems like an area (Valeant) management generally tries to avoid,"" wrote Morningstar analyst Michael Waterhouse in a research note.""Additionally, the likelihood of no insurance coverage could also suppress customer willingness to pay out-of-pocket,"" he said, ""but the drug's avoidance of reimbursement does fit nicely with Valeant's preference for cash-pay products.""

962,LLY,"The world looked a bit flat from a market standpoint early Tuesday, with global markets and commodities largely unmoved and stock futures steering the U.S. market toward a mixed open.Dow futures were down 65.4 points, with IBM (IBM) pulling hard to the downside. S&P 500 futures were off a fraction. Nasdaq 100 futures were up 5.4 points.The focal point of the stock market today. Microsoft (MSFT), Yahoo (YHOO) and Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) also report after the close, as do a number of leading stocks, including Blackhawk Network (HAWK), Illumina (ILMN) and GoPro (GPRO).The economic calendar is blank Tuesday, but big names in motion after early earnings reports included Verizon (VZ) (down 2%), Travelers (TRV) (up 2%), Lockheed Martin (LMT) (unchanged) and United Technologies (UTX) (down 4%).IBM dragged 5% lower after reporting its Q2 earnings beat but revenue fell slightly more than analysts had expected. It was the tech giant's 13th straight quarter of declining revenue, and profit margins in its software division — the source of about half the company's profit — narrowed during the quarter. IBM shares have been in a gradual uptrend since January, fighting to climb out of a 10-month consolidation.Tesla Motors (TSLA) slumped nearly 4% ahead of the open. The stock may have been nicked by a UBS downgrade to sell, in a note that reportedly questioned the company's battery storage and auto delivery targets. Shares rose almost 3% in strong trade Monday. The stock is extended after a rebound from 10-week support and above a 258.85 cup-with-handle buy point.India-based software engineer Infosys (INFY) surged 12%. The country's second largest software developer reported better-than-expected Q2 earnings and raised its full-year revenue guidance above consensus expectations.Management said the company signed six contracts during the quarter with a total value of $688 million. Infosys has been consolidating sine February and battling to retake its 10-week line of support for the past five weeks.The dollar was mixed and commodities were generally flat.

972,LLY,"Merck & Co., Inc (MRK  -  Free Report) presented new data from two studies, evaluating its type II diabetes drug Januvia (sitagliptin) as a treatment option on type II diabetes patients, who initiate insulin therapy and those with a mild renal impairment.The CompoSIT-I study showed higher reduction of blood glucose level in patients, who initiated insulin dosage while continuing treatment with Januvia compared with those who discontinued Januvia. The CompoSIT-R trial evaluated subjects with mild renal impairment, who were not adequately controlled by metformin. Data from this study showed that treatment with Januvia resulted in non-inferiority and superiority in reducing blood glucose levels (A1C) as compared to patients, treated with AstraZeneca’s (AZN  -  Free Report) Farxiga (dapagliflozin).These data were presented at the American Diabetes Association meeting in Orlando, FL.Shares of Merck have gained 8.4% year to date versus the industry’s decline of 4.4% Combined sales of Januvia and Janumet declined 3% in 2017 due to ongoing pricing pressure. Merck’s Januvia franchise is facing pricing pressure due to higher discounts and rebates to maintain good managed care coverage. In the first quarter of 2018, sales of Januvia/Janumet rose 7% to $1.4 billion.Last April, the FDA denied an approval to include cardiovascular outcomes on the labels of Januvia and Janumet. With death toll from cardiovascular disease being significantly higher among adults suffering diabetes in comparison to those without it, the addition of positive cardiovascular findings would have helped drive sales of these drugs. Moreover, with Eli Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) and Boehringer Ingelheim including the cardiovascular indication on the label of their SGLT-2 inhibitor, Jardiance, DPP-IV inhibitors like Januvia could see patients switching to SGLT-2 inhibitors.The latest addition to Merck’s diabetes franchise is Steglatro/ertugliflozin, approved as a monotherapy as well as two fixed-dose combinations with metformin and with Januvia in the United States last December and in the EU, this March. It is important to note that Merck markets Steglatro in a partnership with Pfizer, Inc. (PFE).Merck currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

973,LLY,"Eli Lilly & Company (LLY  -  Free Report) has received a favorable ruling from a U.S. district court in a patent dispute against India’s generic drugmaker Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited (RDY  -  Free Report). The case was related to the vitamin regimen patent on Lilly’s key cancer drug, Alimta (pemetrexed disodium).The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana validated Alimta vitamin regimen patent, stating that it would be infringed by Dr Reddy’s proposed generic products, which are alternative salt forms of pemetrexed.Concurrently, Lilly also informed that earlier this month, the district court also ruled in its favor in a lawsuit against Hospira, a subsidiary of Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report). The court denied Hospira's motion for summary judgement and instead, granted Lilly's cross-motion for summary judgement.Although the compound patent covering Alimta in the United States expired in January 2017, the vitamin regimen patent will remain valid till May 2022, if Alimta’s patent is ultimately upheld through all the remaining challenges.  The compound patent already expired across major European countries and Japan in Dec 2015.Other than Hospira and Dr Reddy’s, several other generic manufacturers including Teva (TEVA  -  Free Report) and Sandoz are seeking approvals in the United States for marketing generic forms of Alimta prior to the expiration of its vitamin regimen patents. We remind investors that last October, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office had validated the Alimta vitamin regimen.The latest wins against Hospira and Dr Reddy’s means these companies can launch their generic versions of Alimta only after the patent expires. However, both companies are expected to appeal against the district court’s decision.Notably, Alimta is one of the top revenue grossers at Lilly and a longer commercial life for Alimta would provide top-line support as several products in Lilly’s portfolio are already facing patent expiration.The entry of generic competition for Alimta following the loss of effective patent protection will cause a rapid decline in revenues for the product.In first-quarter 2018, Alimta sales rose 2% to $499.6 million as higher sales in the United States offset sales decline in the international markets. Outside the United States, the sales of this cancer drug are being hurt due to loss of exclusivity in several countries as well as competitive pressure. Its U.S. sales are also being affected by an increased competition due to the entry of immuno-oncology agents in the market. The favourable patent decision lowers the chances of a generic competition for Alimta before patent expiration, which could have hampered its sales more.Year to date, shares of Lilly have risen 2% against the industry’s decline of 4.4%. Lilly currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

974,LLY,"Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) shares have performed well this year so far in contrast to its industry’s performance. Merck belongs to the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, which is a 14-stock group comprising some of the largest drugmakers of the world.The Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry has underperformed the S&P 500 as well the Zacks Medical Sector. While the stocks in this industry have collectively declined 4.4%, the Zacks S&P 500 Composite and the Zacks Medical Sector have risen 3.7% and 0.1% year to date, respectively. However, Merck’s shares have risen 8.4% this year so far against the industry’s decline of 4.4%. Also, earnings estimates for 2018 rose 1.2% while that for 2019 rose 4.1% over the past 60 days.What’s Behind the Rally?A significant part of Merck’s outperformance this year was driven by strong performance and positive regulatory updates related to its PD-1 inhibitor, Keytruda. In a very short span of time, Keytruda has become Merck’s largest product. It is already approved for use in 10 different settings involving seven different tumor types. This year, it has already gained approval for two new indications. These include third-line treatment of adult as well as pediatric patients with primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL), a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and second-line treatment of recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer. These label expansion approvals should drive sales of Keytruda in the future quarters.The treatment generated sales of $1.5 billion in first-quarter 2018, up 12.9% sequentially and 151% year over year. This upside was driven by the global launch of indications, which further boosted demand.  Keytruda sales are gaining, particularly from strong momentum in the first-line lung cancer indication. In fact, Keytruda is the only anti-PD-1 approved in the first-line setting for certain lung cancer patients both as a monotherapy as well as a combination therapy with Eli Lilly’s (LLY  -  Free Report) cancer drug, Alimta (pemetrexed) and carboplatin (pem/carbo).At the recently concluded annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, this PD-L1 inhibitor stole the limelight with encouraging data from multiple clinical studies. The data presentation from Merck that garnered the most attention from physicians and investors was from a second interim analysis of a pivotal lung cancer study on Keytruda — phase III KEYNOTE-407 study.Keytruda is also being studied for more than 30 types of cancer in more than 700 studies, including in excess of 400 combination studies. Merck is collaborating with several companies including Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report), Incyte, Glaxo and Pfizer separately for the evaluation of Keytruda in combination with other regimens.Other than that, this year Merck and partner AstraZeneca (AZN  -  Free Report) gained approval in Europe and Japan for its PARP inhibitor Lynparza for advanced ovarian cancer and in the United States in metastatic breast cancer. Merck also announced positive data from several late-stage studies, mainly evaluating Keytruda for further line extensions. Merck also signed a deal with Japan’s Eisai Co., Ltd to jointly develop and commercialize the latter’s tyrosine kinase inhibitor, Lenvima, both as a monotherapy as well as in combination with Keytruda, for several types of cancer. It also agreed to buy Viralytics Limited, an Australian pharmaceutical company that develops oncolytic immunotherapies for a range of cancers,which should strengthen its oncology portfolio.ConclusionMerck, which carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), has its share of challenges in the form of generic competition for several drugs and pricing pressure and rising competitive pressure on the diabetes franchise and on products like Isentress (HIV), Zepatier (HCV) and Zostavax (vaccine)Nonetheless, going forward, new products like Keytruda, Lynparza, and Bridion should continue to contribute meaningfully to the top line in 2018. Merck’s Animal Health unit is also strong and remains a core growth driver for the company. Meanwhile, Merck will also continue to focus on cost-cutting initiatives, which should drive its bottom line.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

975,LLY,"The large cap pharmaceuticals sector — comprising some of the largest drugmakers of the world developing drugs for human and veterinary use — was off to a strong start in 2018. However, it struggled thereafter probably on U.S. market instability and a few negative updates on the pipeline and regulatory front. Importantly, a relatively weaker top-line performance by some of the bigwigs due to slower sales of older drugs has also hurt the industry’s performance this year so far. Meanwhile, concerns about the government’s move to check higher prices of drugs/medicines remain an overhang.Nonetheless, an ace investor will know that the drug sector has been one of the best-performing industries in the U.S. stock market. It is widely expected that the sector will rebound in the second half of the year.We believe that new product sales ramp up with rising demand, successful innovation and product line expansion, strong clinical study results and frequent FDA approvals may bring the sector back on track this year. Also, many of these companies have accelerated their cost-saving initiatives to enable investment in new products and defend existing products to optimize long- and short-term growth. Cost savings can drive an earnings upside.Importantly, mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity is ramping up with the tax reform in place. The new tax law, which cuts corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and encourages companies to bring back huge cash held overseas at a one-time tax rate of 10%, is spurring merger activity this year.However, headwinds that can put pressure on the sector are drug pricing scrutiny, pricing and competitive pressure, concerns regarding Amazon’s interest in entering the healthcare arena and major pipeline setbacks. Most importantly, a slowdown in sales of some of the most high-profile older drugs, courtesy of payers and competitive pressure from both branded and generic drugs is a concern for the sector.Industry Lags on Shareholder ReturnsThe Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry, which is a 14-stock group within the broader Zacks Medical Sector, has underperformed the S&P 500 and the sector it belongs to on a year-to-date basis.While the stocks in this industry have collectively declined 3.8%, the Zacks S&P 500 Composite and the Zacks Medical Sector have risen 4.1% and 0.2% year to date, respectively.Year-to-Date Price Performance Large Cap Pharma Stocks Trading CheapThanks to the underperformance of the industry this year, the valuation looks really cheap now. One might get a good sense of the industry’s relative valuation by looking at its forward twelve months price-to-earnings ratio (P/E F12M), which is the most appropriate multiple for valuing large-drug companies.The industry currently has a P/E F12M of 14.16, which is near the lowest level in the past year as well as the past five years. When compared with the highest level of 16.11 and median level of 15.69 over the past year, there is apparently some upside left.The space also looks inexpensive when compared with the Medical market at large, as the current as well as median F12M P/E ratio for the Medical sector is 19.07 and 19.06, respectively.Price-to-Earnings Forward Twelve Months (F12M) Compared to the Zacks S&P 500 Composite too, the space looks cheap. The current F12M P/E ratio for the S&P 500 of 17.26 and the median level of 18.28 for the same period are above the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry’s respective ratios.Price-to-Earnings Forward Twelve Months (F12M) Earnings Outlook Appears NegativeWhile the above ratio analysis shows that there is a solid value-oriented path ahead, one should not really consider the current price levels as good entry points unless there are convincing reasons to predict a rebound in the near term.One reliable measure that can help investors understand the industry’s prospects is the earnings outlook for its member companies. Empirical research shows that a company’s earnings outlook significantly influences the performance of its stock.One could get a good sense of a company’s earnings outlook by comparing the consensus earnings expectation for the current financial year with the last year’s reported number. But an effective measure could be the magnitude and direction of the recent change in earnings estimates.While the consensus earnings estimates for the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry of $4.01 per share implies a decent year-over-year improvement, the trend in earnings estimate revisions has not been favorable lately.Price and Consensus: Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts have begun to lose confidence in this group’s earnings potential.The consensus EPS estimate for the current fiscal year has been revised 0.5% downward since May 31.Current Fiscal Year EPS Estimate Revisions Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Prospects for ImprovementThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks.The Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #208, which places it at the bottom 19% of more than 250 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.However, our proprietary Heat Map shows that the industry’s rank was in the top 50% for the past six weeks and deteriorated only in the past two weeks.  Large Drugmakers Promise Long-Term GrowthThe long-term (3-5 years) EPS growth estimate for the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry appears promising. The group’s mean estimate of long-term EPS growth rate has been increasing since January 2018 to reach the current level of 8.3%. Though this compares unfavorably with 9.8% for the Zacks S&P 500 composite, it is the highest level in the past year.Mean Estimate of Long-Term EPS Growth Rate In fact, the basis of this long-terms EPS growth could be the recovery in the top line that these large drugmakers have been showing since the beginning of 2016.Revenues – Large Cap Pharmaceuticals Market In fact, growing demand for drugs particularly targeted or personalized therapies; increases in the incidence of chronic diseases and technological advancements, evolving treatment regimens, an aging population and increased health care spending are some of the factors that should keep the sector on track in the long term. A faster drug approval process and the proposed removal of outdated regulations that drive up costs and slowdown in innovation should also provide benefits.Another important indication of solid long-term prospect is the improvement in the group’s return on equity (ROE), which is a key metric for evaluating large cap drug stocks.Return on Equity – Large Cap Pharmaceuticals MarketBottom LineSucceeding in a shifting global market and evolv­ing healthcare landscape will require pharma­ceutical companies to adopt innovative business models, invest in new technologies, increase investments in personalized medicines and seek external partners and collabora­tors for complementary strengths.The sector may face some volatility due to the drug pricing issue, pricing/re-imbursement pressure, increasing competition, slowdown in legacy product sales, loss of patent exclusivity of some key drugs and pipeline related setbacks.However, pipeline success in innovative and important therapeutic areas, cost cutting, share buybacks, new product launches, increased M&A activity and appropriate utilization of cash may bring the sector back on track this year.In the Large Cap Pharmaceuticals universe, only one stock currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while another has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Both these companies have witnessed positive earnings estimate revisions.(You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.)H.

976,LLY,"Allergan PLC (AGN  -  Free Report) announced positive top-line results from a phase III study, evaluating its pipeline candidate Bimatoprost SR. Bimatoprost SR is Allergan’s investigational implant, developed as the first sustained-release drop-free treatment option for lowering intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.The phase III study (n=594) compared Bimatoprost SR applied on patients with open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension with timolol eye drops. The trial used two dosages of Bimatoprost SR administered in three cycles (Day 1, Week 16 and Week 32) compared with timolol eye drops, used twice daily for up to 20 months.Data from the study showed that Bimatoprost SR reduced IOP by approximately 30% over the 12-week primary efficacy period, demonstrating non-inferiority in case of timolol.Well received by the patients, Bimatoprost SR showed potential for patients staying on treatment free for more than a year after the last implant was inserted.In glaucoma patients, uncontrolled elevated IOP can lead to vision loss. In order to reduce elevated IOP, patients are prescribed eye drops. However, 80% of glaucoma patients fails to use eye drops as prescribed. Bimatoprost SR, if approved, will provide such patients with an option of a drop-free therapy and free them from daily eye drop regimens. Bimatoprost SR is designed to lower IOP for at least four months.Allergan is expected to report additional data and results from a second phase III study with an identical design in the first half of 2019. A new drug application (NDA) filing to the FDA is also anticipated during the second half of 2019.We would like to remind investors that earlier this week, Allergan announced that its second anti-CGRP candidate, atogepant, met its primary endpoint in a mid-stage study. The CGP-MD-01 study evaluated five doses of atogepant for the prevention of episodic migraine over 12 weeks. Atogepant achieved a reduction of statistical significance in monthly migraine/probable migraine (MPM) headache, days from baseline for all doses.Allergan’s another oral anti-CGRP acute migraine treatment, ubrogepant, has already shown positive results in two phase III studies. However, the migraine market is growing extremely competitive. In May, Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) and its partner Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) received approval for commercializing their anti-CGRP drug, Aimovig, for treating episodic migraine.So far this year, shares of Allergan have increased 4% compared with the industry’s rise of 2.4%. Allergan currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

977,LLY,"Allergan’s (AGN  -  Free Report) anti-calcitonin gene-related peptide (“CGRP”) candidate, atogepant, met the primary endpoint in the phase II part of the phase IIb/III study. The CGP-MD-01 study was evaluating oral dosages of the candidate for the acute treatment of episodic migraine.Meanwhile, the company has another anti-CGRP candidate, ubrogepant, in its pipeline that demonstrated positive results in two phase III studies, evaluating it for the treatment of single migraine attack. The positive data readouts from the CGP-MD-01 study boosts the company’s anti-CGRP pipeline. The company is currently in discussion with regulatory authorities, following which it will advance atogepant to phase III stage of development.Allergan’s shares have increased 4.5% this year so far against the industry’s rise of 1.2%.The CGP-MD-01 study evaluated 5 doses of atogepant — once daily 10mg, 30mg and 60mg, and twice daily 30mg and 60mg — for the prevention of episodic migraine over 12 weeks. Atogepant achieved a reduction of statistical significance in monthly migraine/probable migraine (“MPM”) headache days from baseline for all doses.Allergan will present additional details at upcoming scientific meetings.Moreover, a potential approval for these candidates will boost the company’s migraine product line, which includes Botox for the treatment of chronic migraine. The oral administration will also help ubrogepant and atogepant gain an advantage over other injectable drugs, if approved.Meanwhile, the migraine space is attracting lot of interest due to its high unmet need. Several companies are developing treatments for this disease. In May, Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) and its partner Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) received approval for commercializing their anti-CGRP drug, Aimovig, for treating episodic migraine. Other anti-CGRP candidates under development include Eli Lilly’s (LLY  -  Free Report) galcanezumab, Teva Pharmaceutical’s fremanezumab and Alder BioPharmaceuticals’ eptinezumab. Galcanezumab and fremanezumab are under review in the United States.Migarine is a multi-billion dollar market with approximately 36 million people in the United States suffering from it. Among them, five to six million patients have episodic and chronic migraine.Allergan plc Price  Allergan plc Price | Allergan plc QuoteZacks RankAllergan currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

978,LLY,"Incyte Corporation (INCY  -  Free Report) announced that the phase II trial, REACH1, evaluating lead drug Jakafi in combination with corticosteroids for the treatment of patients with steroid-refractory acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), met its primary endpoint.The data from the study showed that Jakafi demonstrated an overall response rate (ORR) of 55% at day 28.Moreover, the number of patients achieving a response at any point of time, during the study, was 73%.Propelled by positive data from the REACH 1 study, Incyte now plans to file a Supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) with the FDA for the label expansion of Jakafi, for the treatment of steroid-refractory acute GVHD, during the third quarter of 2018.Incyte also plans to present full details from the study, at an upcoming scientific meeting.We note that Jakafi, a first-in-class JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor, is already approved by the FDA for the treatment of people with polycythemia vera (PV), who have had an inadequate response to or are intolerant of hydroxyurea.The drug is also indicated for the treatment of people with intermediate or high-risk myelofibrosis (MF), including primary MF, post–polycythemia vera MF and post–essential thrombocythemia MF. Incyte has a collaboration agreement with Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) for Jakafi. While Jakafi is marketed by Incyte in the United States, it is marketed by Novartis outside the country.Jakafi’s performance has been impressive so far. In order to expand the patient population and increase the commercial potential of the drug, the company is working on expanding the drug’s label, further. In October 2017, the FDA approved a label update of the drug to include the addition of new patient-reported outcome (PRO) data from the COMFORT-I study as well as updating the warning related to progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.A potential label expansion for GVHD shall further boost sales.Incyte’s stock has lost 23.5% in the year so far compared with the industry’s 5.2% decline. Meanwhile, apart from the steroid-refractory acute GVHD study, the REACH trial program also includes the ongoing phase III studies in steroid-refractory acute GVHD (REACH2) and steroid-refractory chronic GVHD (REACH3), both in collaboration with Novartis. Data from the studies are expected in 2019.Incyte is also making efforts to develop other candidates and reduce its dependence on Jakafi.The FDA has recently approved the 2-mg dose of Olumiant (baricitinib), a once-daily oral medication for the treatment of adults with moderately-to-severely active rheumatoid arthritis (RA), who have had an inadequate response to one or more tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor therapies. Incyte and Eli Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) have a partnership for Olumiant.However, Incyte suffered a setback with epacadostat. The external Data Monitoring Committee (eDMC) review of the pivotal phase III study, ECHO-301, evaluating epacadostat in combination with Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda in patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma, determined that the study did not meet the primary endpoint of improving progression-free survival in the overall population compared to pembrolizumab monotherapy.  Zacks RankIncyte currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

979,LLY,"AstraZeneca PLC (AZN  -  Free Report) announced that the European Commission has approved the label expansion of its lung cancer drug, Tagrisso (osimertinib). With this latest development, Tagrisso can be used for first-line treatment of adult patients with locally-advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), whose tumors have EGFR mutations.Tagrisso was hitherto approved in the United States, European Union, Japan and China as a second-line treatment option for patients with EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC.Earlier in April 2018, the FDA gave a nod to Tagrisso (osimertinib) in the first line setting.The EU approval was expected as in April, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use lent a positive opinion recommending approval of Tagrisso in the first-line setting.The approval was based on encouraging data from the phase III FLAURA study, which compared Tagrisso with the standard-of-care EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy in the first-line lung cancer setting.Data from the study showed that the chance of progression or death risk was reduced by more than half in the Tagrisso arm compared with the commonly-used EGFR inhibitors. The median progression-free survival was 18.9 months for patients on Tagrisso compared with 10.2 months in the comparator arm. Tagrisso was well received in the trial with a safety profile, consistent with the previous studies.In the first quarter of 2018, Tagrisso recorded sales of $338 million, up 89% year over year, driven by increased testing rates in the United States and Japan. This approval in the first line setting is likely to boost sales of Tagrisso in the coming quarters.Apart from Tagrisso, AstraZeneca markets several cancer drugs like Imfinzi, Lynparza among others. The company markets Lynparza in partnership with Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report). Oncology sales now comprise almost 25% of AstraZeneca’s total product sales and the metric also rose 19% in 2017.Shares of AstraZeneca have gained 4.9% year to date versus the industry’s decline of 3.7%. AstraZeneca currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

980,LLY,"AbbVie, Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has granted approval for the combination use of its cancer drug Venclexta and Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Rituxan for the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (“CLL”) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), with or without 17p deletion, who have received at least one prior therapy.Venclexta is jointly marketed by AbbVie and Roche’s Pharma arm, Genentech in the United States and by AbbVie outside the United States.The FDA approval for combination use was based on positive data from the phase III MURANO study of Venclexta plus Rituxan in relapse/refractory CLLData from the study, presented in September last year, showed that the combination led to a profound improvement in progression free survival compared to Teva Pharmaceutical’s (TEVA  -  Free Report) Treanda plus Rituxan(BR). Results from the study showed that a fixed duration of treatment with Venclexta plus Rituxan significantly reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 81% compared with BR. Overall response rate (ORR) was 92% in the Venclexta/Rituxan arm compared to 72% for BR.Concurrently, the FDA also approved Venclexta as a monotherapy for CLL or SLL patients, with or without 17p deletion. Until now, as a monotherapy, Venclexta was approved to treat patients with CLL with 17p deletion, as detected by an FDA-approved test.The FDA approval for label expansion of Venclexta for this indication should expand the patient population for Venclexta significantly and boost its commercial potential. With the latest approval, Venclexta/Rituxan becomes the first oral, chemotherapy-free, fixed duration treatment option for CLL patients. Also, this summer, AbbVie will file a regulatory application in the United States for Venclexta in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) while a phase III program in multiple myeloma is also progressing well.AbbVie’s shares have gained 3.8% this year so far against the industry’s decline of 3.7%.AbbVie currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

981,LLY,"Novo Nordisk (NVO  -  Free Report) announced positive headline results of two phase III studies PIONEER 4 comparing 14 mg oral formulation of Ozempic (semaglutide) as a treatment for adults with type II diabetes to Victoza1.8 mg and placebo and PIONEER 7 comparing oral formulation of Ozempicas a treatment for adults with type II diabetes to sitagliptin 100 mg. We remind investors that in December 2017, the FDA approved Ozempic once-daily pre-filled pen to improve glycaemic control in type II diabetes patients. It is also approved in Europe, Japan and Canda for the same indication.The 52 week PIONEER 4 study achieved its primary objective according to the primary statistical approach by demonstrating a non-inferior reduction in blood glucose levels (HbA1c) and statistically significant and superior weight loss at 26 weeks with oral Ozempic compared to Victoza. Ozempic also provided statistically significant and superior reductions in HbA1c and weight compared to placebo. For week 26 and week 52, respectively, people treated with Ozempic experienced a reduction in HbA1cof 1.3% and 1.2% compared to 1.1% and 0.9% with Victoza whereas placebo declined 0.1% and increased 0.2%.Ozempic also demonstrated weight loss of 4.7 kg at 26 weeks and 5 kg at 52 weeks versus 3.2 kg and 3.1 kg with Victoza, and 0.7 kg and 1.2 kg with placebo at 26 and 52 weeks respectively.The increased weight loss with oral Ozempic was also significant compared to Victoza and placebo.The 52-week PIONEER 7 study also achieved its primary objective accordingto the primary statistical principle by demonstrating that people treated with oral semaglutide experienced a statistically significant reduction in HbA1cof 1.4% compared to 0.7% with sitagliptin at week 52. The reduction in body weight of 2.9 kg with oral semaglutide was statistically significantly greater at week 52 compared to 0.8 kg with sitagliptin. Novo Nordisk plans to report the PIONEER 3 study comparing 3, 7 and 14 mg oral semaglutide with 100 mg sitagliptin before the end of second quarter of 2018. Shares of the company have moved down 16.6% year to date compared with the industry’s decline of 4.4%. We remind investors that in May 2018, Novo Nordisk announced headline results from PIONEER 2, the second phase IIIa study with oral formulation of Ozempic for treatment of adults with type II diabetes. The study evaluated the efficacy and safety of 14 mg oral Ozempic compared with 25 mg Eli Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) and Boehringer Ingelheim’s Jardiance (empagliflozin) with type II diabetes inadequately controlled on metformin.The 52 week study achieved its primary objective and demonstrated a statistically significant and superior improvement in HbA1c with oral Ozempic compared to Jardiance at 26 weeks. By mid-2018, the company plans to initiate a cardiovascular outcomes study called SOUL for Ozempic. Also the company plans to initiate a phase IIIa program called STEP in 2018 to explore the potential of once-weekly Ozempic as a treatment for people with obesity.This will also include the cardiovascular outcomes trial, SELECT, which will investigate the impact of Ozempic on the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events compared to placebo in patients with established cardiovascular disease and either overweight or obesity.In GLP-1 market, Lilly’s Trulicity and AstraZeneca's (AZN  -  Free Report) once-weekly Bydureon are competitors to Novo Nordisk’s Ozempic.Novo Nordisk A/S Price Novo Nordisk A/S Price | Novo Nordisk A/S Quote Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderNovo Nordisk has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).A better-ranked stock from the same space is Aeglea BioTherapeutics, Inc.

982,LLY,"A smart beta exchange traded fund, the SPDR S&P Pharmaceuticals ETF (XPH  -  Free Report) debuted on 06/19/2006, and offers broad exposure to the Health Care ETFs category of the U.S. equity market.What Are Smart Beta ETFs?The ETF industry has traditionally been dominated by products based on market capitalization weighted indexes that are designed to represent the market or a particular segment of the market.Investors who believe in market efficiency should consider market cap indexes, as they replicate market returns in a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way.There are some investors, though, who think it's possible to beat the market with great stock selection; this group likely invests in another class of funds known as smart beta, which track non-cap weighted strategies.By attempting to pick stocks that have a better chance of risk-return performance, non-cap weighted indexes are based on certain fundamental characteristics, or a combination of such.While this space offers a number of choices to investors, including simplest equal-weighting, fundamental weighting and volatility/momentum based weighting methodologies, not all these strategies have been able to deliver superior results.Fund Sponsor & IndexManaged by State Street Global Advisors, XPH has amassed assets over $350.04 M, making it one of the average sized ETFs in the Health Care ETFs. This particular fund seeks to match the performance of the S&P Pharmaceuticals Select Industry Index before fees and expenses.The S&P Pharmaceuticals Select Industry Index represents the pharmaceuticals sub-industry portion of the S&P Total Markets Index. The S&P TMI tracks all the U.S. common stocks listed on the NYSE, AMEX, NASDAQ National Market and NASDAQ Small Cap exchanges. The Pharmaceuticals Index is a modified equal weight index.Cost & Other ExpensesCost is an important factor in selecting the right ETF, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins if all other fundamentals are the same.Operating expenses on an annual basis are 0.35% for XPH, making it the least expensive product in the space.It's 12-month trailing dividend yield comes in at 0.70%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsEven though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.Representing 100% of the portfolio, the fund has heaviest allocation to the Healthcare sector.Taking into account individual holdings, Allergan Plc (AGN  -  Free Report) accounts for about 4.46% of the fund's total assets, followed by Eli Lilly And Company (LLY  -  Free Report) and Jazz Pharmaceuticals Plc (JAZZ  -  Free Report).Its top 10 holdings account for approximately 41.83% of XPH's total assets under management.Performance and RiskThe ETF has lost about -5.84% so far this year and is down about -0.63% in the last one year (as of 04/24/2018). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $40.03 and $46.85.The ETF has a beta of 1.28 and standard deviation of 25.67% for the trailing three-year period, making it a high choice in the space. With about 45 holdings, it has more concentrated exposure than peers.AlternativesSPDR S&P Pharmaceuticals ETF is a reasonable option for investors seeking to outperform the Health Care ETFs segment of the market. However, there are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider.IShares U.S. Pharmaceuticals ETF (IHE  -  Free Report) tracks Dow Jones U.S. Select Pharmaceuticals Index and the PowerShares Dynamic Pharmaceuticals Portfolio (PJP  -  Free Report) tracks Dynamic Pharmaceutical Intellidex Index. IShares U.S. Pharmaceuticals ETF has $396.12 M in assets, PowerShares Dynamic Pharmaceuticals Portfolio has $563.27 M. IHE has an expense ratio of 0.44% and PJP charges 0.56%.Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Health Care ETFs.Bottom LineTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.

983,LLY,"In response to President Donald Trump’s tweet on Monday, Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) said that it will defer its recent price increases of several prescription drugs maximum until the end of the year. Chief executive officer (CEO), Ian Read, announced the decision following an “extensive discussion” with the President.Last week, the New York based company had announced an increase in list prices of several drugs, effective Jul 1. This was the second time this year that Pfizer increased prices of its medicines. Pfizer raised prices of its medicines by an average of 9%, which is within the agreed limit of 10% price rise a year. However, prices of a few drugs like Xalatan, Viagra and Chanix have already increased in double digits including the January hike.Pfizer defended the price rise by stating that the list price does not reflect the actual price, which includes a discount. It also mentioned that it had hiked prices of only one-tenth of its drug portfolio and reduced prices of five drugs by 16% to 44%.In his first tweet on Monday, the President criticized Pfizer for the price increases. Trump warned that the administration will act in response and Pfizer and other U.S. drugmakers should be “ashamed” that they have raised drug prices for “no reason”. The tweet also said that by raising drug prices in the United States, these drug companies are offering “bargain basement prices” overseas.In the latest statement, Read said the prices of these medicines will return to their pre-Jul 1 levels as soon as technically possible. He also said the prices will be deferred until the President’s drug pricing blueprint goes into effect or until the end of the year, whichever is sooner. Meanwhile, the price cuts by the company will remain in effect. In a tweet on Tuesday, the President appreciated Pfizer’s decision and hoped others would follow suit.Incidentally, Pfizer’s announcement of the price hike came only a few weeks after Trump’s claim in May that pharma companies would soon take massive price cuts voluntarily. However, there have been no signs of such price cuts.Pfizer faced criticism for the price hikes as there is a concern that price hike by one company may soon trigger a market-wide increase in prices by drugmakers like J&J (JNJ  -  Free Report), Merck (MRK  -  Free Report), Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) and others.This year so far, Pfizer's shares have increased 3.3% against a decrease of 2.2% for the industry.  Pfizer currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

984,LLY,"Merck & Co., Inc.’s (MRK  -  Free Report) PD-L1 inhibitor, Keytruda ruled at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) in Chicago as the drug giant presented additional data from two pivotal lung cancer studies on the drug.Merck presented additional data from the pivotal KEYNOTE-042 study in patients with locally advanced or metastatic nonsquamous or squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors express PD-L1 protein levels of 1 percent or greater  (TPS of ≥1 percent).In April, Merck had said that in such patients, Keytruda led to a significant survival benefit compared with platinum-based chemotherapy. With the latest release, the company said that in patients with TPS of ≥1 percent, median overall survival (OS) was 16.7 months in the Keytruda arm versus 12.1 months in chemotherapy arm. In the PD-L1 TPS ≥50 percent patient population, median OS was 20 months while that in patients with TPS of ≥20 percent was 17.7 months versus 12.2 months and 13 months, respectively for chemotherapy alone.Also, Merck said the risk of progression or death or progression-free survival (PFS) — the secondary endpoint — was 19% in the PD-L1 TPS ≥50 percent population at the time of interim analysis, which was not statistically significant.Notably, Keytruda monotherapy is already marketed for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors express PD-L1 protein levels of 50 percent or greater (TPS of ≥50 percent) based on data from the KEYNOTE-024 study.If the OS data from KEYNOTE-042 study are approved to be included in Keytruda’s label, the drug can be prescribed to treat an expanded lung cancer patient population, further reinforcing its position in the lung cancer market. Later in the year, Merck will file regulatory application to get the OS data from the study included in the label of Keytruda.Merck also announced data from a second interim analysis of a pivotallung cancer study on Keytruda — phase III KEYNOTE- 407 study — which evaluated Keytruda in combination with carboplatin-paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel (chemotherapy) for the first-line treatment of metastatic squamous NSCLC. The data from the study showed that the combination of Keytruda plus chemotherapy led to significant improvement in both OS and PFS regardless of PD-L1 expression. The risk of death (OS) was reduced by 36% compared to chemotherapy alone. The median OS was 15.9 months in the Keytruda combination group versus 11.3 months in the chemotherapy arm. The PFS improvement was nearly half for patients in the Keytruda combination group compared with chemotherapy alone. The median PFS was 6.4 months in the Keytruda combination group versus 4.1 months in the chemotherapy arm.A regulatory application to include data from this study was submitted to the FDA in May. At the same time, the company had presented data from the first interim analysis of the KEYNOTE- 407 study. It said that the study met a pre-specified secondary endpoint of overall response rate (ORR) in an early cohort of participants. At ASCO, the company said that ORR was 57.9% in the Keytruda arm compared to 38.4% for chemotherapy aloneMetastatic squamous NSCLC is a difficult-to-treat population, which accounts for about 30% of lung cancer cases. If the Keytruda combination is approved to treat this difficult-to-treat population, lung cancer sales of the drug should improve further.This year so far, Merck’s shares have outperformed the industry. Its shares have risen 7.6% in the period against the industry’s decline of 4.5%.Keytruda is the second largest product in Merck’s portfolio. It is marketed for many types of cancer and treatment settings including lung cancer, melanoma, head and neck cancer, classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma, gastric cancer, bladder cancer and microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient cancer.The treatment fetched sales of $3.8 billion in 2017, up almost 172% year over year. This upside is driven by the global launch of new indications, which further bolstered demand.  Keytruda sales are gaining, particularly from strong momentum in the first-line lung cancer indication. In fact, Keytruda is the only anti-PD-1 approved in the first-line setting for certain lung cancer patients both as a monotherapy as well as a combination therapy with Eli Lilly’s (LLY  -  Free Report) cancer drug, Alimta (pemetrexed) and carboplatin (pem/carbo).Meanwhile, Keytruda is being evaluated in several lung cancer studies across multiple settings and stages of the disease, both as a monotherapy as well as a combination therapy.At ASCO, Merck also presented data from several combination studies of tyrosinekinase inhibitor, Lenvimaplus Keytruda at ASCO.The studies evaluating the Lenvima/Keytruda combination in four different tumor types — unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN), advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC), and advanced endometrial carcinoma (EC) — demonstrated encouraging ORR as well as safety profile of this cancer combination.We remind investors that in March, Merck formed a deal with Japan’s Eisai to co-develop and commercialize Lenvima, both as a monotherapy as well as in combination with Keytruda for several types of cancer.At ASCO, Merck also presented interim data from a mid-stage study (KEYNOTE-427) evaluating Keytruda monotherapy for the first-line treatment of advanced clear cell RCC. The data showed that in the Keytruda arm, the ORR — the primary endpoint — was 38.2%. Meanwhile, in a sub-group of patients whose tumors expressed PD-L1, the ORR was 50%.Keytruda is being studied for more than 30 types of cancer, in more than 700 studies, including in excess of 400 combination studies. Merck is collaborating with several companies including Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report), Incyte, Glaxo (GSK  -  Free Report) and Pfizer separately for the evaluation of Keytruda in combination with other regimens.Merck currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

985,LLY,"Allergan plc (AGN  -  Free Report) announced a nationwide recall of some sample packs of Taytulla softgel oral contraceptive capsules (1mg/20mcg). Allergan said that four non-hormonal placebo pills were erroneously placed where the contraceptive capsules should have been. This instigated the recall following a physician report on the same.Allergan warned that the four inactive pills raise the risk of unintended pregnancy and the patients who have concerns should consult a doctor.Shares of Allergan were down almost 2% on Tuesday following the recall. In fact, so far this year, Allergan’s share price has declined 7.7%, compared with the industry’s decline of 5.8%.Despite a strong first-quarter performance and positive regulatory updates, shares of this pharma company continue to decline this year.We believe that this is because Allergan is facing loss of exclusivity for several of its key products and this will continue through 2018.This is what concerns analysts. While the first generic versions of Alzheimer’s treatment Namenda XR and Estrace cream were launched in the first quarter, that of blockbuster dry-eye drug, Restasis, Allergan’s second best-selling drug, is expected to be launched in the second quarter.A generic version of Delzicol is also expected to be launched in early second-quarter 2018.Allergan estimates that the products facing loss of exclusivity wereworth$3 billion in 2017.

986,LLY,"Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) is reportedly raising prices of almost 100 drugs, effective July 1. This is the second time that the drug giant has raised the prices of its drugs this year. The scrutiny of drug prices has increased since Trump assumed office. However, with a softer drug pricing policy formed last month, we expect other companies to follow suit.The increase in price was nearly 9% for the majority of the drugs, within the agreed limit of 10% price rise a year. However, price of a few drugs like Xalatan, Viagra and Chanix have already increased in double digits including the price hike of January.On May 11, Trump announced plans to control drug prices in the United States. However, a group of investors believe the plan is not likely to have a major impact on the profits of large pharma companies. Instead of including provisions of direct negotiations by Medicare with the pharma companies, Trump targeted intermediaries, certain small pharma companies and foreign countries. Thus, Medicare is a major customer of drugs, paying nearly 30% of dollar values of prescriptions filled. Medicare could have negotiated lower prices directly from the manufacturers.The President also expects to increase competition by streamlining some approval-related regulatory processes and promoting faster approval to generics/biosimilars. The plan allows more substitutions/additions in Medicare’s drug list for single-source generics to contain price rise and gives sponsors more negotiation power with manufacturers. It also instructs companies to display list prices in advertising. The plan also focuses more on transparency related to pricing and availability of generics.Moreover, the announcement of the price hike by Pfizer comes after weeks of Trump’s claim that pharma companies will take massive price cuts voluntarily soon.Pfizer has defended the price rise by stating that list price does not reflect actual price, which includes discount. It also mentioned that it has hiked prices for only one-tenth of its drug portfolio and also reduced prices of five drugs by 16% to 44%.Meanwhile, price hike by one company may soon trigger a market-wide increase in drug prices. Thus, Pfizer’s move can again stir the opposition related to drug price rise, especially by large pharma companies. Along with Pfizer, stock prices of several other large cap pharma companies moved north on Jul 2 including Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report), Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) and AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report). A rise in drugs prices will certainly help these companies to boost its profits.So far this year, the large cap pharma industry has declined 5.1% against the S&P 500’s rise of 2.2%.We expect investors to remain focused on other pharma companies for any announcement related to drug prices and any subsequent move by the government to restrict any further hike.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

987,LLY,"Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA  -  Free Report) confirmed that FDA has extended the action date of the Biologics License Application (BLA) for fremanezumab. The action date for fremanezumab is now set for September 16, 2018, which was previously set for mid-June. There are no additional data requests from the FDA.Fremanezumab is an investigational therapy currently under review by the FDA as a quarterly or monthly injection for the preventive treatment of migraine in adults.  It is also under review in the European Union.Shares of Teva increased 11.6% year to date against the industry’s decline of 6.2%.We remind investors that the FDA accepted for review the company’s BLA for fremanezumab  in December 2017 and  granted fast-track designation to the candidate. However, in January 2018, Teva’s partner Celltrion received a warning letter from FDA for a facility in South Korea, following an inspection of the fill/finish side of the facility, thus delaying the approval of the drug. This facility manufactures active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) for fremanezumab.Teva, thus, stated in its first quarter 2018 earnings call that it did not expect to receive FDA approval on its BLA for fremanezumab on the mid-June date. The company was in a constructive dialogue with the FDA in close collaboration with partner Celltrion.Recently, we note that Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) and partner Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) have received FDA approval for their pipeline candidate Aimovig (erenumab) for the prevention of migraine. The drug is the first FDA-approved treatment, specifically developed to treat migraine by blocking calcitonin gene-related peptide (""CGRP"") receptor.Another Pharma giant Eli Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) has anti-CGRP candidate- galcanezumab, which is under review in the United States.

988,LLY,"Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) announced that its pivotal study – KEYNOTE-407 – evaluating Keytruda-chemotherapy combination in first-line metastatic squamous non-small cell lung cancer (“NSCLC”) met its dual primary endpoint of overall survival (“OS”) and progression free survival (“PFS”). The drug in combination with chemotherapy demonstrated significantly longer OS and PFS versus chemotherapy alone.Merck’s supplemental Biologics License Application (“sBLA”) seeking continued approval of Keytruda combined with Eli Lilly’s (LLY  -  Free Report) Alimta and platinum chemotherapy for treating metastatic non-squamous NSCLC is under review in the United States. The sBLA was filed based on encouraging data from another phase III study, KEYNOTE-189.The company plans to share data from the KEYNOTE-407 study with FDA and may expand the sBLA to include patients with squamous histology.The company will present detailed data from the KEYNOTE-407 study at the upcoming annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology next month.Shares of Merck were up 0.2% in after-market trading after the news was announced. This year so far, Merck’s shares have outperformed the industry. Its shares have risen 5.1% in the period against the industry’s decline of 4%.Notably, Keytruda is already approved as monotherapy for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors express PD-L1 protein levels of 50% or greater. Keytruda also has accelerated approval to treat first-line patients with metastatic NSCLC in combination with Alimta and chemotherapy.Merck remains focused on developing Keytruda as monotherapy or combination therapy for the treatment of lung cancer with various mutation or histology in first-line setting in a bid to further reinforce its position in that segment. Lung cancer is an attractive market as it is the largest cause of death among all cancer patients.Moreover, Keytruda is the only immune-oncology drug, which is approved for the treatment of lung cancer in the first-line setting. We remind investors that Bristol-Myers (BMY  -  Free Report) is also developing its immune-oncology drug, Opdivo, in first-line lung cancer. However, Keytruda’s early entry and positive data readouts from several phase III studies in expanded first-line lung cancer patients bode well for the company’s top line.We note that Keytruda is marketed for many types of cancer and treatment settings including lung cancer, melanoma, head and neck cancer, classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma, gastric cancer, bladder cancer and microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient cancer.Meanwhile, Keytruda is being studied for more than 30 types of cancer, in more than 700 studies, including in excess of 400 combination studies. Merck is collaborating with several companies including Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report), Incyte, Glaxo and Pfizer separately for the evaluation of Keytruda in combination with other regimens.Merck & Co., Inc.

989,LLY,"Investors interested in Large Cap Pharmaceuticals stocks are likely familiar with Eli Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) and Novo Nordisk (NVO  -  Free Report). But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.Eli Lilly has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Novo Nordisk has a Zacks Rank of #5 (Strong Sell) right now. This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that LLY is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the tried-and-true P/E ratio, the P/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use.LLY currently has a forward P/E ratio of 16.87, while NVO has a forward P/E of 17.83. We also note that LLY has a PEG ratio of 1.47. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. NVO currently has a PEG ratio of 2.40.Another notable valuation metric for LLY is its P/B ratio of 6.46. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, NVO has a P/B of 14.94.These metrics, and several others, help LLY earn a Value grade of B, while NVO has been given a Value grade of C.LLY has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than NVO, so it seems like value investors will conclude that LLY is the superior option right now.

Data from the study demonstrated that as an adjuvant treatment, Keytruda significantly increased recurrence free survival (“RFS”) after surgery compared to placebo in such patients. The drug reduced the risk of disease recurrence or death by 43% over placebo.In the study, RFS was achieved in 75.4% of the patients treated with Keytruda over a year, compared to 61% for placebo. Keytruda also significantly prolonged RFS in patients with PD-L1 positive tumors by reducing risk of recurrence or death by 46% over placebo.Data from the study will be presented at the American Association for Cancer Research (""AACR"") Annual Meeting 2018 and will be published in The New England Journal of Medicine.Shares of Merck have outperformed the industry so far this year. Shares have returned 1.6% against the industry’s decline of 2.7% in the said period.The study is being conducted in collaboration with the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer.Merck claimed that Keytruda is the first anti-PD1 therapy to achieve RFS benefit in stage IIIA, IIIB and IIIC melanoma patients.

993,LLY,"AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) has announced that its pipeline candidate, upadacitinib, met the primary endpoints in the 4th phase III study from its SELECT program, which evaluated the candidate for the treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Upadacitinib is an investigational oral JAK1-selective inhibitor, which is being studied as a once-a-day oral therapy.The phase III SELECT-COMPARE study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of upadacitinib (15 mg) compared with placebo and AbbVie’s marketed drug, Humira (adalimumab), over 12 weeks on patients with moderate-to-severe RA, who are on a stable background of methotrexate and had an inadequate response. In the study, upadacitinib met both the primary as well as secondary endpoints compared with placebo while showing superiority as compared to Humira.The primary endpoints of the study registered ACR20 responses and clinical remission. Data from the trial demonstrated that 71% of patients receiving the 15 m oral once-daily dose of upadacitinib 15 mg achieved an ACR20 response compared with 36% of patients receiving placebo at week 12. Moreover, 29% of subjects treated with upadacitinib achieved complete remission in comparison to 6% with placebo.Additionally, data from the study also showed that 45% of patients experienced low disease activity (secondary endpoint) when treated with upadacitinib compared with 29% receiving Humira and 14%, receiving placebo at week 12.Notably, SELECT-COMPARE is the fourth of the six ongoing phase III studies under the SELECT RA clinical trial program conducted on upadacitinib.We remind investors that last December, AbbVie announced that upadacitinib met the primary endpoints in the 3rd phase III study from its SELECT trial.Other researches are also underway on upadacitinib for treating Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis and atopic dermatitis.Shares of AbbVie have rallied 42.7% in the past year, outperforming the industry’s 6.4% rise.Notably, AbbVie already has a strong presence in the RA market with its blockbuster drug, Humira. However, several companies are working on developing biosimilar versions of Humira which could induce competition in the market for the company. Also, the RA market is extremely crowded including drugs like Johnson & Johnson’s Simponi and UCB’s Cimzia among others.Significantly, Eli Lilly’s (LLY  -  Free Report) JAK inhibitor, Olumiant, was approved in the EU for RA last February and Pfizer’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Xeljanz is marketed in the United States for the same indication, which might pose a strong competition for upadacitinib on approval.Also, of late, Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report) has announced resolution of the ongoing patent dispute with AbbVie regarding Biogen’s biosimilar version of Humira, in the EU. Per the settlement agreement, Biogen plans to launch Humira biosimilar in Europe by October, 2018.However, if upadacitinib is approved, it might reduce the potential negative impact of Humira generics on AbbVie’s top line.AbbVie Inc.

994,LLY,"Another Alzheimer’s candidate failed in clinical studies this week. An independent data monitoring committee (“IDMC”) recommended Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) and AstraZeneca (AZN  -  Free Report) to discontinue two studies on lanabecestat. Shares of Israel-based small biotech, Galmed Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (GLMD  -  Free Report) rose after it announced positive data from a mid-stage study on its NASH candidate Aramchol. Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) gained FDA approval for two new indications of its blockbuster anti-PD-1 therapy, Keytruda. While Glaxo’s (GSK  -  Free Report) late-stage HIV studies met the primary endpoint, AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report), Roche (RHHBY  -  Free Report) and AstraZeneca gained regulatory nods for label expansion of their key cancer drugs.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesLilly/AstraZeneca’s Alzheimer’s Candidate Fails: Lilly and AstraZeneca are discontinuing two late-stage studies on their Alzheimer disease candidate, lanabecestat, on recommendation of the IDMC.The IDMC said that the two studies — one in early Alzheimer's disease and the other in mild Alzheimer's disease dementia — were unlikely to meet the primary endpoints upon completion, leading to a decision to discontinue these studies on the oral beta secretase cleaving enzyme (BACE) inhibitor. The latest setback adds to a long list of failed treatment options for this deadly brain disease. (Read more: Lilly & AstraZeneca Scrap Studies on Alzheimer's Candidate)Merck’s Keytruda Gets FDA Nod for Two New Indications: Merck gained FDA’s accelerated approval for two new indications for its blockbuster anti-PD-1 therapy, Keytruda this week. These include third-line treatment of adult as well as pediatric patients with primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL), a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and second-line treatment of recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer. These label expansion approvals should drive sales of Keytruda in the future quarters.Also, Merck’s regulatory application seeking approval for an expanded age indication of its HPV vaccine Gardasil was granted priority review by the FDA. Merck is looking to get Gardasil approved for women and men aged 27 to 45. The HPV vaccine is presently approved for men and women aged 9 to 26.

The studies were conducted on treatment naïve HIV-1 infected adults — those who have not received prior antiviral therapy. Regulatory application to get the two-drug regimen of dolutegravir and lamivudine approved is expected to be filed later this year.In another positive news for Glaxo, Mylan's generic version of Glaxo’s blockbuster respiratory drug, Advair was delayed again with a second complete response letter from the FDA.Galmed Shares Hit the Roof as NASH Candidate Succeeds in Study: Galmed announced positive top-line results from a mid-stage study on its lead candidate, Aramchol, for the treatment of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The study demonstrated that Aramchol was effective at reaching its primary endpoints.Importantly, reduction in liver fat, as measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy, was demonstrated in patients who had completed 52 weeks of treatment with Aramchol 400mg compared to placebo. These results strongly support the advancement of Aramchol to pivotal phase III studies. Shares of the company skyrocketed around 150% after this news was announced. (Read more: Galmed Soars on Positive NASH Data on Aramchol)Allergan’s Anti-CGRP Drug Meets Goal in Study: Allergan announced that its second anti-CGRP candidate, atogepant, met the primary endpoint in a mid-stage study. The CGP-MD-01 study evaluated 5 doses of atogepant for the prevention of episodic migraine over 12 weeks. Atogepant achieved a reduction of statistical significance in monthly migraine/probable migraine (“MPM”) headache days from baseline for all doses.Allergan’s another oral anti-CGRP acute migraine treatment, ubrogepant, has already shown positive results in two phase III studies.Separately, Allergan announced positive top-line data from a phase III study on its pipeline candidate Bimatoprost SR, an investigational implant developed as the first sustained-release drop-free treatment option for lowering intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. Data from the study showed that Bimatoprost SR reduced IOP by approximately 30% over the 12-week primary efficacy period, thereby demonstrating non-inferiority to the study comparator, timolol eye drops.AbbVie/Roche Cancer Drugs Get FDA Nod for Combo Use: AbbVie and Roche announced FDA approval for the combination use of their cancer drugs Venclexta and Rituxan, for previously treated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (“CLL”). The FDA approval was based on positive data from the phase III MURANO study of Venclexta plus Rituxan in relapse/refractory CLL. Venclexta is jointly marketed by AbbVie and Roche’s subsidiary Genentech in the United States and by AbbVie outside the United States.Separately, Roche announced FDA approval for its cancer drug, Avastin in combination with chemotherapy (carboplatin and paclitaxel) for the treatment for women with advanced ovarian cancer following initial surgery. With this latest approval, Avastin is now approved for six different types of cancer in the United States.Tagrisso Gets EU Approval in First-Line Setting: AstraZeneca’s (AZN  -  Free Report) lung cancer drug Tagrisso gained EU approval for the first-line treatment of adult patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have EGFR mutations. A similar label expansion application was approved in the United States in April. Until now, Tagrisso was approved in the United States, European Union, Japan and China as a second-line treatment option for patients with EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC. The label expansion in the first-line setting should drive sales of Tagrisso higher in future quarters.

995,LLY,"Ever since President Trump’s imposition of tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from China, markets at large have suffered dearly. There have been a number of meetings between trade representatives from both the countries but all in vain.To further escalate trade-war tensions, reports have surfaced from the U.S. Treasury Department that it has been drafting policies, which prohibit firms having more than 25% Chinese ownership to benefit from emerging technologies in the United States.Such policies would have negative ramifications for industries like healthcare, biotech and pharmaceutical which are tech-heavy and need to acquire industrially efficient technologies for growth and sustenance. So would a trade-war with China turn out to be a nightmare for the U.S. healthcare sector? Let’s have a look.Trump’s Protectionism Would Dampen U.S. Healthcare FortunesEarly-stage pharmaceutical startups and biotech companies have historically benefited from increased access to Chinese investment and resources. Intellectual property rights’ protection is going to hamper the growing entrepreneurial spirit in the biotech space in the long run. The brunt would be borne more by relatively small-scale startups as American VCs focus more on larger startups from top-notch universities.Further, China has not included any medical products in the retaliatory tariffs that it imposed on the United States and is not likely to do so in the future as well. However, in case such a scenario occurs, it would not be too good for the healthcare industry. As a norm, China refrains from using copies of drugs from American biotech companies. Experts fear that if China gets down to violating patent rights due to the escalation of trade war, it might start copying drugs from companies having significant exposure to the Asian country.Under such circumstances, companies from the U.S. pharmaceutical and drug industry would have to pay dearly. Such a turn of events would also result in dwindling global share of the U.S. healthcare industry.Market leaders of the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceutical Industry such as AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report), GlaxoSmithKline (GSK  -  Free Report), Eli Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report), Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) and Pifzer (PFE  -  Free Report) would end up being the biggest losers. Such companies not only have significant Chinese exposure but are highly vulnerable to instances of I.P. right infringements. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Chinese Investment is Oxygen for U.S. Biotech and Pharma Chinese venture-capital funds have invested a whopping $1.4 billion in U.S. biotech and drug companies in the period between January through March. This surpasses the $125.5 million in investments by Chinese VCs for the whole of 2017. Part of such an increase can be attributed to China’s efforts in becoming the leader in healthcare investments across the globe.China increasingly wants to make use of the manufacturing-intensive nature of their economy. Another reason for typically increasing investments in U.S. biotech firms is that China wants to access novel therapies that it can make use of along with high returns from such investments.However, any restriction by the Trump administration on Chinese involvement in U.S. biotech can spell doomsday for the industry. One of the big reasons is that it is relatively cheaper for the drug and pharmaceutical companies to perform clinical trials in China. The China Drug Administration (CDA) or the Chinese FDA takes less than a third of the time taken by the U.S. FDA in approving results. Consequently, costs involved are also lower over there.To ConcludeThe U.S. pharmaceutical industry has suffered in the recent past due to rising costs associated with raw materials. Trump’s act of tariff imposition on China has proved to be rather counterproductive for several industries at large and might turn out to be nightmarish for the healthcare industry.It is a known fact that Chinese investments breathe life into small and mid-scale healthcare companies in America. Finally, in the event of China infringing drug patent rights from American companies having significant operations on Chinese shores, a bloodbath in the healthcare industry would be inevitable.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

996,LLY,"Merck & Co. Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has accepted its supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for Keytruda, an anti-PD-1 therapy, for review. The company is seeking approval of the blockbuster drug as adjuvant therapy in the treatment of patients with resected, high-risk stage III melanoma. A decision is expected by Feb 16, 2019.This year so far, Merck’s shares have outperformed the industry. Its shares have risen 8.5% in the period against the industry’s decline of 4.9%.The sBLA includes data from pivotal EORTC1325/KEYNOTE-054 study, which demonstrated that Keytruda achieved significant increase in recurrence free survival (“RFS”) after surgery compared to placebo in the patient population. Recurrence free survival was achieved in 75.4% of the patients treated with Keytruda over a year, compared to 61% for placebo. The drug also reduced the risk of disease recurrence or death by 43% over placebo.Merck has claimed that Keytruda is the first anti-PD1 therapy to achieve RFS benefit in stage IIIA, IIIB and IIIC melanoma patients. The drug has achieved RFS benefit in patients irrespective of BRAF-mutation.We remind investors that the drug is already approved for seven types of cancer indications in several settings including first-line melanoma and recently approved cervical cancer and large-cell lymphoma. Keytruda garnered sales of $1.5 billion in first-quarter 2018, up 12.9% sequentially and 151% year over year.Sales of the drug were particularly boosted by the strong momentum in the first-line lung cancer indication. It is the only approved anti-PD-1 therapy as a monotherapy or in combination with Eli Lilly’s (LLY  -  Free Report) cancer drug, Alimta (pemetrexed) and carboplatin.Merck is focused on further developing this successful drug in other indications. Keytruda is being evaluated in more than 700 studies, including in excess of 400 combination studies for more than 30 types of cancer.

997,LLY,"Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) announced FDA’s accelerated approval for its PD-1 inhibitor, Keytruda as a third-line treatment for adult as well as pediatric patients with primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL), a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.The company will need to evaluate the drug in confirmatory studies in this indication for gaining continued approval.This is the second indication for which Keytruda has gained FDA approval this week. On Tuesday, Keytruda gained FDA’s accelerated approval for advanced cervical cancer in second-line setting. These label expansion approvals should drive sales of Keytruda in the future quarters.With the latest approval, Keytruda became the first anti-PD-1 therapy approved in PMBCL. This is also the second indication for Keytruda for a hematologic malignancy, the first being refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) for which FDA approval was received in March 2017. The approval was based on data from KEYNOTE-170 study.This year so far, Merck’s shares have outperformed the industry. Its shares have risen 11.2% in the period against the industry’s decline of 4.4%.Keytruda is the largest product in Merck’s portfolio. Prior to the latest approvals, Keytruda was approved for use in 10 different settings involving seven different tumor types.The treatment generated sales of $1.5 billion in first-quarter 2018, up 12.9% sequentially and 151% year over year. This upside was driven by the global launch of indications, which further boosted demand.  Keytruda sales are gaining, particularly from strong momentum in the first-line lung cancer indication. In fact, Keytruda is the only anti-PD-1 approved in the first-line setting for certain lung cancer patients both as a monotherapy as well as a combination therapy with Eli Lilly’s (LLY  -  Free Report) cancer drug, Alimta (pemetrexed) and carboplatin (pem/carbo).At the recently concluded annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, this PD-L1 inhibitor stole the limelight with encouraging data from multiple clinical studies. The data presentation from Merck, which garnered the most attention from physicians and investors was from a second interim analysis of a pivotal lung cancer study on Keytruda — phase III KEYNOTE-407 study.Keytruda is being studied for more than 30 types of cancer in more than 700 studies, including in excess of 400 combination studies. Merck is collaborating with several companies including Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report), Incyte, Glaxo (GSK  -  Free Report) and Pfizer separately for the evaluation of Keytruda in combination with other regimens.In a separate press release, Merck announced that its supplemental biologics license application (sBLA) seeking approval for an expanded age indication for its HPV vaccine Gardasil was granted priority review by the FDA.The sBLA is aimed at getting Gardasil approved for women and men aged 27 to 45 for the prevention of certain HPV-related cancers and diseases.

998,LLY,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 2.7% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is LLY due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Lilly Tops on Q1 Earnings & Sales, Raises 2018 ViewLilly reported first-quarter 2018 adjusted earnings per share of $1.34, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.13 per share by 18.6%. Earnings rose 37% (up 47% ex Fx) from the year-ago quarter backed by robust growth in new product sales and lower operating costs. Meanwhile, lower tax rates and a reduction in shares outstanding from shares repurchase also led to higher earnings in the quarter.Including asset impairment, restructuring, and other special charges, first-quarter earnings per share were $1.16 against a loss of 10 cents in the first-quarter of 2017.Revenues in DetailQuarterly revenues of $5.70 billion also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.53 billion. Sales grew 9% year over year (up 5% ex Fx) backed by strong demand for its new drugs and favorable currency movement, which made up for lower sales of established products like Strattera, Cialis and Forteo.Volumes rose 2% as increased demand for new products like Trulicity, Cyramza, Taltz, Basaglar, Jardiance and Lartruvo offset decline in sales of some established products like Strattera and Effient and Axiron due to loss of exclusivity and Cialis due to lower demand. However, volume growth was softer than 4% in the previous quarter.New products (products launched since 2014) drove 11% of volume growth and generated over $1.5 billion in revenues, representing nearly 25% total revenues, up from 23% in the previous quarter. On the other hand, the loss of exclusivity for Effient, Strattera, Zyprexa, Cymbalta, Evista and Axiron hurt volumes by 510 basis points. Lower demand for Cialis and food animal products hurt volumes by 230 and 120 basis points, respectively.Higher realized prices for several drugs contributed 3% to sales growth in the quarter. Foreign exchange rate also had a favorable impact of 4%.While U.S. revenues grew 8% to $3.16 billion, ex-U.S. revenues rose 11% to $2.55 billion.Pharmaceutical revenues rose 11% in the quarter. However, decreased demand for food animal products continued to hurt sales in Lilly’s Animal Health segment with sales declining 1% in the quarter.Established products that recorded growth during the quarter include Humalog (up 12% year over year to $791.7 million), Humulin (up 4% to $325.9 million) and Trajenta (up 25% to $141.1 million).Forteo sales declined 10% to $313.2 million due to decreased volume from unfavorable wholesale and retail buying patterns in the United States. However, in ex-U.S. markets, sales of Forteo increased.Cymbalta sales declined 3% to $169.6 million while Erbitux sales declined 3% to $149.6 million. Zyprexa sales declined 17% to $122.6 million.Alimta sales rose 2% to $499.6 million as higher sales in United States offset sales decline in international markets. In ex-U.S. markets, sales declined 3% to $254.3 million due to competitive pressure and loss of exclusivity in certain countries. However, sales of Alimta increased 8% to $245.3 million in the United States due to increased volume and higher realized prices.Cialis sales declined 7% to $495.4 million hurt by lower demand in United States due to the entry of generic sildenafil and loss of exclusivity in Europe.Strattera sales declined 33% to $130.7 million due to loss of exclusivity.Among the new products, Trulicity generated revenues of $678.3 million, up 82% year over year, with U.S. revenues benefiting from growth in the GLP-1 market and market share gains.Cyramza revenues were $183.6 million, up 7% year over year, backed by strong demand. Cyramza’s ex-U.S. revenues increased 10%, benefiting from strong volumes and currency benefit, partially offset by lower realized prices. Cyramza U.S. revenues increased 3% driven by increased volume and higher realized prices.Jardiance sales surged 104% to $151 million, driven by increased market share within the growing SGLT2 class in the United States and increased volume outside the United States.Basaglar recorded revenues of $166.0 million compared with $153.8 million in the previous quarter. It generated revenues of $126.7 million in the United States, which improved sequentially driven by increased demand as the drug gained Medicare Part D formulary access. Sales growth was flat in ex-U.S. markets.Taltz brought in sales of $146.5 million compared with $172.5 million in the previous quarter as higher ex-U.S. revenues were offset by lower U.S. sales. While ex-U.S. sales benefitted from continued uptake from new launches, sales in the United States were hurt by unfavorable specialty pharmacy buying patterns.Lartruvo (olaratumab) generated revenues of $64.4 million in the quarter compared with $59.0 million in the previous quarter.Olumiant (baricitinib) has been launched in select European countries and in Japan for moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis. The drug generated sales of $32.2 million in the quarter backed by strong launch uptake in Germany, compared with $23.0 million in the previous quarter.Verzenio, which was launched in the Unites States in the fourth quarter of 2017, generated sales of $29.7 million in the quarter compared with $21 million in the previous quarter. In the quarter, Verzenio gained FDA approval and was launched in the first-line setting for metastatic breast cancer based on MONARCH 3 data.Elanco Animal Health segment sales declined 1% (down 4% ex-Fx) to $761.3 million due to decreased demand for food animal products.Food animal products revenues declined 7% hurt by market access pressure.Companion animal revenues rose 10% due to higher realized prices and currency benefits.Gross Margin & Operating Income Adjusted gross margin of 75.1% in the quarter decreased 270 basis points as manufacturing efficiencies and higher realized prices were offset by negative product mix and the effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold. Excluding the effects of foreign exchange on international inventory sold, gross margins increased nearly 70 bps.Operating income increased 29% year over year to $1.60 billion due to lower operating costs. Total operating expenses (including research and development and marketing, selling and administrative expenses), as a percent of revenues, declined 710 basis points in the quarter to 46.9% due to the company’s cost saving efforts.While marketing, selling and administrative expenses declined 4%, R&D declined 6% in the quarter.Adjusted effective tax rate was 15.9%, lower than 21.2% in the year-ago quarter driven primarily by the impact of US tax reform.2018 Guidance UppedLilly raised its previously issued outlook for adjusted earnings as well as sales.Adjusted earnings per share are now expected in the range of $5.10 to $5.20, higher than $4.81 to $4.91 expected previously, to reflect the expected benefit from higher operating profits and lower tax rates.The revenue range was also slightly upped to $23.7 billion to $24.2 billion from $23.0 billion to $23.5 billion expected previously.The sales guidance increase was due to lower anticipated rebates/discounts resulting from lower expected Medicaid utilization and payer mix and positive impact of currency.Gross margin is expected to be approximately 75%, same as previously expected. Adjusted tax rate is expected to be approximately 17% (previously approximately 18%).Marketing, selling and administrative expense guidance was tightened to a range of $6.2–$6.3 billion compared with $6.1–$6.4 billion previously. Research and development expense guidance was slightly increased to a range of $5.2–$5.4 billion compared with $5.0–$5.2 billion previously due to increased funding requirement for pipeline development.Going forward, new products like Trulicity, Taltz, Basaglar, Cyramza, Jardiance, Lartruvo, Verzenio and Olumiant are expected to drive revenues.After being slightly negative in the first half, Animal Health revenues are expected to improve in the second half of 2018 supported by new product launches.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates. There have been four revisions higher for the current quarter.Eli Lilly and Company Price and Consensus Eli Lilly and Company Price and Consensus | Eli Lilly and Company QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, LLY has an average Growth Score of C, however its Momentum is doing a bit better with a B.

999,LLY,"Eli Lilly & Company (LLY  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has approved the inclusion of additional data on the label of its psoriasis injection, Taltz. With the latest approval, Taltz label will now include data for psoriasis involving the genital area, which impacts roughly 63% of psoriasis patients over the course of their disease.Taltz is already marketed for the treatment of adult patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy as well as for active psoriatic arthritis. Taltz works by specifically targeting IL-17A, a protein that plays a role in driving underlying inflammation in psoriasis.The drug recorded sales of $146.5 million in the first quarter of 2018. The label expansion will expand the eligible patient population of the drug, which should drive sales going forward.The approval for genital psoriasis was based on data from a study evaluating patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis involving the genital area. In the study, Taltz demonstrated a significant improvement compared to placebo at 12 weeks in the severity of psoriasis affecting the genital area, overall psoriasis, genital itch and the impact of genital psoriasis on sexual activity in such patients.Though many other drugs like Novartis’ (NVS  -  Free Report) Cosentyx, J&J’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) Tremfya and AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Humira are approved to treat plaque psoriasis, Lilly claims Taltz is now the first and only FDA approved treatment for genital psoriasisTaltz is also being studied in a late-stage study for axial spondyloarthritis.Year to date, Lilly’s shares have declined 2.6% compared with the industry’s decline of 3.8%. Lilly currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1000,LLY,"Amgen, Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has approved its supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) seeking label expansion for Prolia for the treatment glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (“GIOP”) in men and women at high risk of fracture or those who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapy.This is the fifth approved indication for Prolia. The approval is backed by increase in bone mineral density (“BMD”) achieved by the drug in a phase III study.The drug is presently marketed in the United States for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture as well as to increase bone mass in men with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture.Shares of Amgen were up 0.1% in after-market trading following the news. The company’s shares have rallied 1.5% this year so far against the industry’s decline of 9.8%.The phase III study evaluated Prolia for the treatment of GIOP patients in men and women at high risk of fracture or those who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapy compared to Allergan’s (AGN  -  Free Report) Actonel (risedronate). The study comprises two patient groups – one with patients who have received glucocorticoid treatment for less than three months prior to study enrollment (glucocorticoid-initiating arm) and the second with patients who have received glucocorticoid treatment for at least three months (glucocorticoid-continuing arm). In both the arms, the glucocorticoid treatment was continued for at least six months.Data from the study showed that Prolia increased lumbar spine BMD by 3.8% compared with 0.8% by Actonel in glucocorticoid-initiating arm. Lumbar spine BMD in patients treated with Prolia in glucocorticoid-continuing arm increased 4.4% compared with 2.3% for Actonel.Glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis is the most common form of secondary osteoporosis. This serious condition is presently treated with glucocorticoid treatment, which increases fracture risk within the first three months of treatment. Prolia can now cater to an expanded patient population and drive sales higher.Prolia is a key revenue generator for Amgen and is witnessing market share gains in both the United States and internationally amid competition from generics of other drugs approved for osteoporosis. In 2017, the drug generated sales of $1.97 billion, up 20% year over year.Prolia faces competition from several drugs, especially from generic versions of Eli Lilly’s (LLY  -  Free Report) Evista (alendronate), Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Fosamax (raloxifene) and Novartis’ Zometa (zoledronate).Amgen Inc.

1001,LLY,"Shares of vTv Therapeutics, Inc. (VTVT  -  Free Report) plummeted significantly after the company announced dismal results from the part A of the phase III trial, STEADFAST, on pipeline candidate, azeliragon.vTv Therapeutics’ stock has plunged 50.6% in the last six months as against the industry’s decline of 18.9%.  The candidate was being evaluated in patients suffering from Alzheimer’s disease. The results showed that the candidate did not meet co-primary efficacy endpoint as patients taking azeliragon versus placebo did not improve in cognitive or functional outcomes as measured by theAlzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog) and the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes (CDR-sb).The study comprised two independent and identical randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III trials (part A and part B). The azeliragon treated group in part A showed a 4.4 point decline from baseline in ADAS-Cog and a 1.6 point dip from baseline in CDR-sb compared to a placebo fall of 3.3 and 1.6, respectively. However, these differences were not statistically significant. azeliragon was generally well-tolerated with a 25% withdrawal rate over 18 months that was similar in both the placebo and treatment arms.Consequently, vTv Therapeutics discontinued ongoing studies involving azeliragon, including the open-label extension study and part B of the STEADFAST study.Nevertheless, a substantial portion of patients in part B of STEADFAST will have completed 12 months of treatment under the study protocol.The failure of the late-stage study is disappointing for investors as the successful development and subsequent commercialization of the candidate would have significantly boosted growth prospects given the complexity of the drugs.Of late, there has been many failures of drugs being developed for Alzheimer’s. In February 2018, Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) announced that it will stop the phase III study, APECS, which was evaluating verubecestat (MK-8931), an investigational small molecule inhibitor of the beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), in patients with prodromal Alzheimer’s disease. The decision was taken after an external Data Monitoring Committee, which assessed overall benefit/risk during a recent interim safety analysis, concluded that it was unlikely that positive benefit/risk was possible.  In January 2018, Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) announced plans to end its research efforts to discover new drugs for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Eli Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) is another major company which has suffered many failures in its attempt to develop drugs for Alzheimer’s.Zacks RankvTv Therapeutics currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

1002,LLY,"Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) announced data from a phase III study which showed that treatment with its PD-1 inhibitor, Keytruda monotherapy led to significantly improved overall survival (OS) as a first-line therapy in certain lung cancer patients.The pivotal KEYNOTE-042 study evaluated patients with locally advanced or metastatic nonsquamous or squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors express PD-L1 protein levels of 1 percent or greater  (TPS of ≥1 percent). In such patients, Keytruda showed a significant survival benefit compared with platinum-based chemotherapyNotably, Keytruda monotherapy is already marketed for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors express PD-L1 protein levels of 50 percent or greater (TPS of ≥50 percent) based on data from the KEYNOTE-024 study.If the OS data from KEYNOTE-042 study are approved to be included in Keytruda’s label, the drug can be prescribed to treat an expanded lung cancer patient population, further reinforcing its position in the lung cancer market.The study will continue to evaluate progression-free survival (PFS) — the secondary endpoint — based on recommendation of an independent Data Monitoring Committee (“DMC”).Later in the year, Merck will present data from the KEYNOTE-042 study medical meeting and will also file regulatory application to get the OS data from the study included in the label of Keytruda.Shares of Merck were up more than 5% on Apr 9 after the news was announced before market open. This year so far, Merck’s shares have outperformed the industry. Its shares have risen 0.7% in the period against the industry’s decline of 3.6%.Meanwhile, Keytruda is being evaluated in several lung cancer studies across multiple settings and stages of the disease, both as a monotherapy as well as a combination therapy.Keytruda is the second largest product in the Merck portfolio. It is marketed for many types of cancer and treatment settings including lung cancer, melanoma, head and neck cancer, classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma, gastric cancer, bladder cancer and microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient cancer.The treatment fetched sales of $3.8 billion in 2017, up almost 172% year over year. This upside is driven by the global launch of new indications, which further bolstered demand.  Keytruda sales are gaining, particularly from strong momentum in the first-line lung cancer indication. In fact, Keytruda is the only anti-PD-1 approved in the first-line setting for certain lung cancer patients both as a monotherapy as well as a combination therapy with Eli Lilly’s (LLY  -  Free Report) cancer drug Alimta (pemetrexed) and carboplatin (pem/carbo).The Keytruda development program also significantly advanced in 2017 with several regulatory approvals in the United States, Europe and Japan. The new approvals expanded the patient population, driving up sales last year. The positive momentum is expected to sustain in 2018 as well.Meanwhile, Keytruda is being studied for more than 30 types of cancer, in more than 700 studies, including in excess of 400 combination studies. Merck is collaborating with several companies including Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report), Incyte, Glaxo (GSK  -  Free Report) and Pfizer separately for the evaluation of Keytruda in combination with other regimens.Merck carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1004,LLY,"Eli Lilly & Company (LLY  -  Free Report) and its Swiss partner AstraZeneca (AZN  -  Free Report) announced the discontinuation of two late-stage studies on their Alzheimer’s disease (AD) candidate, lanabecestat, on recommendation of the independent data monitoring committee (IDMC).The IDMC said that the AMARANTH study evaluating lanabecestat in early Alzheimer's disease and the DAYBREAK-ALZ study in mild Alzheimer's disease dementia were unlikely to meet the primary endpoints upon completion, leading to the decision to discontinue the studies on the oral beta secretase cleaving enzyme (BACE) inhibitor. The companies claim that the recommendation to stop the studies was not based on safety concerns.As Lilly does not expect to incur significant costs related to these discontinuations, it maintained its previously issued 2018 earnings guidance. Meanwhile, the 2014 partnership between Lilly and AstraZeneca to develop a BACE inhibitor remains intact.Lilly and AstraZeneca are also developing another treatment for Alzheimer's disease, an antibody targeting beta amyloid in early-stage studies.Year to date, Lilly’s shares have risen 1.7% against the industry’s decline of 3.7%.This is not the first failure for Lilly in the Alzheimer’s disease market, In November 2016, Lilly’s anti-amyloid candidate solanezumab failed to meet the primary endpoint in a late-stage AD study. Lilly decided to drop the development of solanezumab. Lilly also suffered a major setback in August 2010, when it had to halt the development of another phase III Alzheimer’s candidate, semagacestat.The Alzheimer’s disease market has attracted a lot of attention from several companies. However, the successful development of therapies for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease, a fatal illness that causes progressive decline in memory, is challenging and we note that several companies have failed in this regard.In May this year, J&J (JNJ  -  Free Report) halted development of atabecestat, its investigational BACE inhibitor, which was being developed for preclinical stage Alzheimer’s disease, due to safety concerns.In February this year, Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) discontinued the second late-stage study evaluating its BACE inhibitor verubecestat for the treatment of prodromal Alzheimer’s disease as its success was unlikely. In February last year, Merck discontinued a late-stage study evaluating verubecestat for mild-to-moderate Alzheimer’s disease due to lack of efficacy.In late 2017, Biogen’s Alzheimer’s disease study on BAN2401 failed to show early positive results, which raised investors’ concern about the candidate’s chances of success.The Alzheimer’s disease market represents huge commercial potential and a successfully developed product could generate billions of dollars in sales once launched.Lilly currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1005,LLY,"Alzheimer’s, a fatal illness that causes progressive decline in memory, has always been a highly challenging area with not much progress being made in spite of significant investments (both funds and resources).On Tuesday, Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) and its Swiss partner AstraZeneca (AZN  -  Free Report) said they are discontinuing two late-stage studies on their Alzheimer’s disease candidate, lanabecestat, on recommendation of the independent data monitoring committee (IDMC). The IDMC said that the two studies were unlikely to meet their primary goals upon completion. This prompted the decision of stalling the studies on the oral beta secretase cleaving enzyme (BACE) inhibitor.Several companies have failed to develop safe and effective treatment options for this deadly brain disease.In May this year, J&J (JNJ  -  Free Report) halted development of atabecestat, its investigational BACE inhibitor, which was being developed for preclinical stage AD due to safety concerns.In February this year, Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) discontinued the second late-stage study evaluating its BACE inhibitor verubecestat for the treatment of prodromal AD as its success was unlikely. In February last year, Merck discontinued a late-stage study evaluating verubecestat for mild-to-moderate AD due to lack of efficacy.In January, Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) said it will end R&D efforts in the Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease areas. Long back, Pfizer had shelved its late-stage AD candidate, bapineuzumab IV after it failed two phase III studies.In late 2017, Biogen’s (BIIB  -  Free Report) AD study on BAN2401 failed to show early positive results, which raised investors’ concerns about the candidate’s chances of success.Clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company Axovant Sciences suffered a major setback in September 2017 when its investigational AD candidate failed to meet the co-primary efficacy endpoints in a late-stage study. The company decided to discontinue development of the 35 mg dose for the treatment of AD.Lilly decided in November 2016 that it would not seek approval for its investigational AD treatment, solanezumab, following disappointing results from a late-stage study. The candidate was being evaluated to see whether it can slow the progression of memory problems associated with amyloid, a protein that forms plaques in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s.According to the Alzheimer's Association, in the 10 years from 2002-2012, 244 drugs were tested for Alzheimer’s in studies registered with clinicaltrials.gov out of which only one succeeded and went on to gain FDA approval.This may be somewhat because the underlying causes of severe neurological ailments like Alzheimer’s may not be as clear as diseases like cancer. Also, Alzheimer’s progress may go unnoticed for years.  By the time, the symptoms of the ailment become evident, significant functions may be already lost, which makes developing drugs to treat this disease difficult.Interest Still Alive in the AreaDespite the setbacks, several companies continue to invest heavily in developing Alzheimer’s disease treatments, given the high commercial potential in this market. Success in this area means huge returns considering more than five million Americans are living with Alzheimer’s disease with the numbers expected to triple by 2050 (Data: Alzheimer's Association). It is considered to be one of the biggest burdens of society and is the sixth leading cause of death across all ages in the United States. The market has immense commercial potential and companies coming out with new treatments could rake in billions of dollars in sales.Biogen, Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report), Eisai, AstraZeneca and Amgen are presently working on Alzheimer’s disease treatments.Biogen’s AD pipeline comprises mid as well as late-stage candidates with different mechanisms of action including anti-tau candidate (BIIB092), anti-amyloid (aducanumab) candidates as well as a BACE inhibitor (elenbecestat) program. These candidates are being developed in collaboration with Eisai.  Meanwhile, Novartis and Amgen are collaborating for BACE 1 inhibitor, CNP520, which has fast track status in the United Status. Roche is collaborating with AC Immune for the development of Alzheimer’s disease treatments.Lilly and AstraZeneca are also developing another treatment for Alzheimer's disease, an antibody targeting beta amyloid in early-stage studies.Earlier this year, the FDA proposed new guidelines, which are aimed at lowering the clinical study goals of Alzheimer’s disease drugs aimed to treat earlier-stage patients who have not yet displayed functional disability or clinical abnormality. This strategy is part of FDA’s ongoing efforts to expand access to safe and effective treatment options for many serious conditions. These efforts by the FDA may also reinvigorate research efforts for Alzheimer’s drugs after repeated failures.Lilly and Merck carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1006,LLY,"Last year turned out to be pretty good for pharma and biotech stocks as far as FDA decisions are concerned. The regulatory body approved 46 novel drugs, easily surpassing 2016’s total tally of 22.Landmark decisions last year include the approval of a couple of gene-based therapies for cancer – Novartis’s (NVS  -  Free Report) Kymriah and Gilead Sciences’ (GILD  -  Free Report) Yescarta. These therapies have the potential to change the way we look at cancer treatments.With just a quarter gone by this year, the FDA has already granted approval to six new treatments. Key approvals include J&J’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) next-generation oral androgen receptor (“AR”) inhibitor Erleada (apalutamide) for pre-metastatic prostate cancer (CRPC), Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated’s (VRTX  -  Free Report) third medicine to treat the underlying cause of CF, Symdeko, which is a combination of tezacaftor and ivacaftor, Gilead’s once-daily single tablet HIV regimen Biktarvy and Novartis’s Lutathera for certain gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.With the drug development process being lengthy and time-consuming, plus requiring the utilization of a lot of funds and resources, key pipeline events including data readouts and regulatory updates are of paramount importance and could act as major catalysts. Let’s take a look at a few important regulatory events scheduled for the month of April.Note that this month, the FDA has already approved Pacira Pharmaceuticals’s Exparel for a new indication as a nerve block for regional analgesia and Clovis Oncology’s PARP inhibitor Rubraca as maintenance therapy for recurrent ovarian cancer.Second Indication for Novartis’ Kymriah: On Apr 30, the FDA is expected to give its decision on Novartis’ supplemental biologics license application (BLA) looking for approval of Kymriah for its second indication. With the latest filing, Novartis is looking to get Kymriah approved for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBLC) — most common form of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma — who have failed two or more prior therapies. Kymriah was approved for the treatment of a deadly cancer called acute lymphoblastic leukemia last August. According to the company’s annual report, 10-15% of DLBLC patients do not respond to initial therapy or relapse within three months of treatment, indicating the significant market potential for Kymriah in the DLBLC indication.FDA Decision on Mallinckrodt’s Label Expansion of Amitiza in Children: Mallinckrodt plc’s (MNK  -  Free Report) supplemental new drug application (sNDA) looking to get its constipation drug Amitiza approved for paediatric functional constipation between six and 17 years, is under review. The FDA is expected to give its decision on Apr 28. Amtiza was added to Mallinckrodt’s portfolio with the February acquisition of Sucampo Pharmaceuticals.Amitiza is already approved for chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) in adults, irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C) among adult women and opioid-induced constipation (OIC) in patients with chronic non-cancer pain. According to the company’s press release, Amitiza, if approved for paediatric functional constipation, would be the first and only prescription medication specifically approved for such patients, who have limited treatment options to address their disease.Will an FDA Panel Back GW Pharmaceuticals’ Epidiolex and Incyte/Lilly’s Olumiant? An FDA panel is expected to give its opinion on GW Pharmaceuticals’ lead cannabinoid pipeline candidate, Epidiolex, next week. GW Pharmaceuticals is looking to get Epidiolex approved as an adjunctive treatment for seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (“LGS”) and Dravet syndrome. Both are highly treatment-resistant forms of childhood-onset epilepsy.With the FDA granting priority review to Epidiolex’s NDA, a response from the FDA is expected by Jun 27, 2018. Epidiolex represents blockbuster potential especially if it is approved across all possible indications.An FDA panel is also expected to give its opinion this month on Incyte/Lilly’s (LLY  -  Free Report) Olumiant (baricitinib) for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis. In April 2017, the companies had received a complete response letter (CRL) from the FDA for baricitinib. The FDA required additional clinical data. TheNDA for Olumiant was re-submitted in January. Olumiant has already been launched in select European countries and in Japan, and fetched sales of $46 million in 2017.Although the FDA takes the recommendations of its panels/advisory committe into account while reviewing applications, it is not bound to follow the same.FDA Decisions for Rigel’s Tavalisse and Ultragenyx’s Burosumab on April 17: The FDA is expected to give its decision on Rigel Pharmaceuticals NDA for Tavalisse (fostamatinib) for the treatment of chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) on Apr 17. Rigel is preparing for the launch of this oral spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) inhibitor in the second quarter, if approved. Existing therapies to treat chronic ITP include steroids, blood platelet production boosters (TPOs) and splenectomy. However, still the disease remains inadequately treated in many patients. This means that if approved, Tavalisse should enjoy significant market potential.Another FDA decision expected on Apr 17 is on Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical’s BLA for burosumab to treat pediatric and adult patients with X-Linked Hypophosphatemia (XLH). Burosumab was approved for treating XLH by the trade name of Crysvita in the EU in February.FDA to Decide on Prometic’s Ryplazim: This FDA decision, expected on Apr 14, will be on Canadian biotech Prometic Life Sciences’ biologics license application (BLA) for Ryplazim for the treatment of congenital plasminogen deficiency. Ryplazim enjoyed Orphan Drug and Fast Track Designations by the FDA for the said indication.Bristol Myers’ Opdivo+Yervoy Combo to Get FDA Approval? Bristol Myers (BMY  -  Free Report) has filed an sBLA looking get its blockbuster drug Opdivo approved in combination with its another cancer drug Yervoy in patients with previously untreated advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (“RCC”). The FDA decision is expected in Apr 16.In clinical studies, the combination has demonstrated superior overall survival (OS) compared with the current standard of care sunitinib in intermediate- and poor-risk patients. This bodes well for the drug given the potential in the targeted market.The PD-1 inhibitor is presently approved in several countries including the United States, the EU and Japan for several cancer indications. Label expansion should boost Opdivo’s sales further. Opdivo generated sales of almost $5 billion in 2017.Bristol-Myers is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.

1007,LLY,"Migraine is a serious neurological disease, which has significant effects on patients’ daily life. Patients suffer from debilitating pain and physical impairment along with fear of the next attack. It is estimated that patients with frequent migraine attacks may lose more than half of their life to the disease.Last week, Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) and partner Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) announced FDA approval for their drug, Aimovig (erenumab) for the prevention of migraine. Aimovig is the first FDA-approved drug specifically developed for the treatment of migraine by blocking calcitonin gene-related peptide (""CGRP"") receptor.The approval was based on positive data from several mid- and late-stage studies.The drug achieved significant reduction in monthly migraine days and use of acute migraine medications compared to placebo, per data from these studies. Moreover, Aimovig showed three times higher probability in reducing migraine days by half compared to placebo in patients with  episodic migraine patients and who failed two to four prior treatments.With the approval of Aimovig, investors’ focus has shifted to CGRP drugs/candidates for the treatment of migraine. Eli Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited’s (TEVA  -  Free Report) respective anti-CGRP candidates, galcanezumab and fremanezumab  are under review in the United States. Alder BioPharmaceuticals, Inc. (ALDR  -  Free Report) is also developing its anti-CGRP candidate, eptinezumab, for treating migraine.Alder, in its first-quarter regulatory filing, stated that there are approximately 36 million people living with this serious neurological disease in the United States alone, including five to six million with episodic and chronic migraine. Migraine is ranked among the top 10 causes of years lived with disability worldwide.However, the traditional preventive therapies have tolerability limitations along with several side-effects. This represents a huge unmet need for new anti-CGRP therapies like Aimovig and other under review candidates. Per a CNBC article and Alder’s regulatory filing, the migraine market will be worth $1 - $2 billion in the next few years.Amgen has priced Aimovig at $575 for a once monthly 70 or 140 mg single-use prefilled SureClick autoinjector or $6,900 annually. The price will certainly pinch patients and thus the acceptance of the drug remains to be seen. However, insurance coverage along with Aimovig copay program may significantly bring down the cost. Moreover, potential approval to galcanezumab and fremanezumab in the coming months will increase competition, which may put downward pressure on pricing.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

1008,LLY,"This week AstraZeneca (AZN  -  Free Report), Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) and Eli Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) announced regulatory and pipeline updates on line extensions of their marketed drugs. While AstraZeneca’s asthma drug Fasenra failed to meet the primary endpoint in a late-stage study evaluating it for an expanded indication — chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (“COPD”); Lilly’s migraine candidate galcanezumab met the same in a late-stage study, evaluating it for another indication — prevention of episodic cluster headache.Novartis’ multiple sclerosis (“MS”) drug Gilenya gained FDA approval for use in adolescents. Its CGRP antibody, Aimovig, also gained FDA approval for prevention of migraine. Zoetis (ZTS  -  Free Report) and Lilly announced acquisition deals.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesLilly’s to Buy Another Small Cancer Biotech: Lilly has agreed to buy an early-phase oncology asset, AK-01, from AurKa Pharma to expand its oncology pipeline. Lilly will make an upfront payment of $110 million and acquire all shares of AurKa Pharma. This is Lilly’s second cancer acquisition in less than a week. Last week, Lilly had announced an all-cash deal tobuy immuno-oncology biotech, ARMO Biosciences for $1.6 billion. (Read More: Eli Lilly to Buy AurKa Pharma, Expand Cancer Pipeline)In another development, its migraine candidate galcanezumab met the primary endpoint in a late-stage study, evaluating it for another indication — prevention of episodic cluster headache. Galcanezumab is already under review in the United States for migraine prevention with a decision expected in the third quarter of the year. However, a separate phase III study evaluating galcanezumab in patients with chronic cluster headache did not meet the primary endpoint. (Read more: Eli Lilly’s Cluster Headache Candidate Succeeds in Phase III)Zoetis to Buy Abaxis: Zoetis announced a definitive agreement to buy California-based Abaxis, which is leading global provider of veterinary point-of-care diagnostic instruments for approximately $2 billion or $83 per share in cash.

(Read more: Zoetis Inks Deal to Acquire Abaxis for $2 Billion)Novartis’ Aimovig Gets FDA Nod: Novartis and partner Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) gained FDA approval for their CGRP antibody, Aimovig for the prevention of migraine. With the FDA approval, Aimovig is now the first and only FDA-approved treatment for migraine, which works by blocking the calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor (CGRP) that plays a critical role in migraine attacks. Meanwhile, Lilly and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA  -  Free Report) are also awaiting FDA approval for their CGRP migraine candidates, galcanezumab and fremanezumab this year.Novartis’ MS drug Gilenya gained FDA approval for the treatment of children and adolescents aged between 10 and 18 with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. The approval for this expanded patient population should boost sales of Gilenya. The drug recorded sales of $821 million in the first quarter, representing year-over-year growth rate of 8% on a constant currency basis.

1009,LLY,"AstraZeneca plc (AZN  -  Free Report) missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both earnings and sales in the first quarter of 2018 hit by declining sales of its cholesterol drug, Crestor. The Swiss pharma giant maintained its previously issued outlook for 2018. The stock declined more than 2% in pre-market trading on Friday.This year so far, AstraZeneca’s shares have risen 5.0% against the industry’s decline of 3.8%.First-quarter 2018 core earnings were 24 cents per American Depositary Share (ADS), which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 28 cents. Core earnings per share of 48 cents declined 51% year over year at constant exchange rates (CER) hurt by lower revenues and operating profit. Meanwhile, lower other income due to the unfavorable timing of divestments also hurt earnings in the quarter.Total revenues declined 9% at CER to $5.18 billion in the reported quarter due to lower product sales as well as externalization revenues. Revenues also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.34 billion.All growth rates mentioned below are on a year-over-year basis and at CER.Product Sales DeclineProduct sales declined 2% at CER in the quarter to $4.99 billion. Higher sales of newer medicines and strong performance in China were offset by rapid erosion in sales of Crestor and lower sales of many other legacy medicines. Externalization revenues were $193 million in the quarter, down 67%.Externalization revenues are the revenues arising from AstraZeneca’s externalization agreements.Older ProductsCrestor sales declined 42% to $389 million with the United States accounting for $46 million (down 59%) and Europe contributing $65 million (down 70% at CER). U.S. and Europe sales were weak as multiple generic versions of the drug entered the market.Seroquel XR sales declined 25% to $53 million due to competition from generic launches.Symbicort sales declined 12% in the quarter to $634 million due to sales decline in the U.S. market. Symbicort sales in the United States declined 28% in the quarter due to pricing pressure and the unfavorable timing of government buying. Sales rose in Europe and Emerging markets.Nexium recorded sales of $448 million, down 7% due to declining sales in the United States and Europe.Other key legacy products that recorded sales decline in the quarter include Zoladex (down 6% to $184 million), Arimidex (down 2% to $54 million), Casodex (down 13% to $52 million), Pulmicort (down 3% to $346 million), Daliresp/Daxas (down 16% to $38 million), Synagis (down 2% to $224 million) and Atacand (down 9% to $71 million).Very few older drugs grew in the quarter including Faslodex (up 14% to $254 million) and Seloken/Toprol-XL (up 3% to $200 million).Newer ProductsAmong the newer medicines, Lynparza sales rose 100% to $119 million in the quarter. Sales in the United States surged 144%, gaining from recent label expansion approvals. In Europe, sales rose 44%, pushed higher by a number of successful launches, high BRCA-testing rates and encouraging levels of reimbursement. In the first quarter, Lynparza gained approval in Japan for ovarian cancer and in the United States in breast cancer, which should drive sales further in 2018. Please note that AstraZeneca has a partnership agreement with Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) for Lynparza.Brilinta/Brilique sales were $293 million in the reported quarter, up 24% year over year. Brilinta maintained its leadership position in the U.S. branded oral anti-platelet market as well as in a number of European markets. Farxiga recorded sales of $298 million in the quarter, up 39% as the medicine continued to lead the market by volume.New respiratory product Fasenra got off to a strong start, recording sales of $21 million in the quarter, supported by strong launch and uptake in United States and Germany. Fasenra was approved in the United States in November last year and in the EU and Japan in January this year.In the quarter, Onglyza sales declined 19% to $129 million, reflecting pressure on DPP-4 class and increased competitive pressure from classes of diabetes medicines whose label includes CV benefits.Tagrisso recorded sales of $338 million, up 89% year over year driven by increased testing rates in the United States and Japan. Last month, AstraZeneca secured an FDA approval for Tagrisso in the first-line setting for advanced lung cancer, which can drive sales higher in the future quarters.Among other new medicines, Movantik/Moventig recorded sales of $28 million in the quarter, less than $30 million in the previous quarter while Iressa sales declined 1% to $132 million.Bevespi, a LAMA/LABA in a pressurized metered dose inhaler launched commercially in the United States in January 2017, recorded sales of $5 million in the quarter, less than $8 million in the previous quarter amid slower-than-anticipated growth in LAMA/LABA class.PD-L1 inhibitor Imfinzi generated sales of $62 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared with $18 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. In February, Imfinzi was approved and immediately launched for the second indication in the United States — early stage lung cancer (NSCLC) — which drove sales in the first quarter. Imfinzi was launched in the United States for the first indication – second line advanced bladder cancer - in May 2017.Calquence, which was launched in the United States in October last year, generated sales of $8 million in the first quarter compared with $3 million in the previous quarter.Regional PerformanceIn the United States, product sales were flat at $1.49 billion as higher sales of newer products was offset by lower Symbicort sales, unfavorable managed-care pricing and generic launches. European markets witnessed a 12% decline in sales to $1.12 billion due to weak Crestor sales. Revenues from Emerging Markets were up 8% to $1.77 billion, primarily on the back of strong growth in China (up 22% to $1.03 billion) while sales declined 7% in ex-China markets due to challenging conditions in the healthcare market in Russia. In Established ROW market (comprising Japan, Canada and other markets), sales declined 10% to $612 million.Profit DiscussionAstraZeneca’s core gross margin declined 40 basis points (bps) to 78.8%. Core selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses rose 6% to $2.03 billion due to investment in new product launches.In the quarter, core research and development (R&D) expenses declined 12% to $1.24 billion driven by efficiency savings. Operating margins declined 130 bps to 17.3% in the quarter.2018 OutlookAstraZeneca maintained its previously issued earnings and sales outlook.AstraZeneca expects core EPS for 2018 in the range of $1.65 to $1.75 per ADR. The company expects product sales to grow in low single digit percentage. However, product sales growth is expected to be weighted toward the second half of the year.AstraZeneca is hopeful that the effects of the Crestor patent expiration in Europe and Japan will recede materially in the second halfManagement guided that total externalization revenues and other income in 2018 will be less than 2017.Currency movements are expected to favorably impact product sales and core earnings per share by a low single-digit percentage.While adjusted R&D costs are expected to be in line or decline in a low single-digit percentage range from 2017 levels, the company anticipates SG&A costs to increase by a low to mid-single digit percentage to support product launches like Fasenra and Imfinzi.Adjusted tax rate is expected to be in the range of 16%-20% compared with 14% for 2017.AstraZeneca currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1011,LLY,"Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) announced that the European Commission (“EC”) has approved label expansion of its blockbuster drug, Prolia. The drug is now approved for the treatment of bone loss associated with long-term systemic glucocorticoid therapy in adult patients at increased risk of fracture. This is also called glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis.This is the third approved indication for Prolia in Europe. The approval is backed by increase in bone mineral density (“BMD”) achieved by the drug in a phase III study.A similar line extension application received approval in the United States last month.Prolia is presently marketed in Europe for the treatment of men and postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture as well as to increase bone mass in men with prostate cancer receiving hormone ablation.Amgen’s shares have increased 6% this year so far against the industry’s decline of 6.9%. The phase III study evaluated Prolia for improvement in BMD in patients receiving glucocorticoid treatment, compared to Allergan’s (AGN  -  Free Report) Actonel (risedronate). The study comprises two patient groups – one with patients on sustained glucocorticoid treatment (glucocorticoid-continuing arm) and the second with patients initiating glucocorticoid therapy (glucocorticoid-initiating arm). In both arms, Prolia demonstrated greater improvement in lumbar spine BMD in patients at one year and two years compared to Actonel, the study’s primary endpoint.Glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis is the most common form of secondary osteoporosis. Per the press release, 30% to 40% of the patients receiving glucocorticoid treatment for the long term have shown vertebral fractures. Although the proportion of eligible patients is small, this line extension is likely to boost sales of the drug further.Prolia is one of the major revenue sources for Amgen and is witnessing growth in market share in both the United States and internationally amid competition from generics of other drugs approved for osteoporosis. In the first quarter of 2018, the drug generated sales of almost half a billion dollars, up 16.5% year over year.The drug faces competition from generics of other branded drugs including Eli Lilly’s (LLY  -  Free Report) Evista (alendronate), Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Fosamax (raloxifene) and Novartis’ Zometa (zoledronate).Amgen Inc.

1012,LLY,"There is no approved therapy that can completely cure autoimmune or inflammatory diseases. The development of new treatment technologies is ongoing. Meanwhile, it is difficult to control autoimmune diseases in the majority of patients. The newest class of medications to treat these diseases is janus kinase (“JAK”) inhibitors, which are providing patients a better treatment option. This class of therapies has generated significant interest due to their better efficacy compared to tumor necrosis factor (“TNF”) inhibitor therapies.Autoimmune DiseasesIn patients with autoimmune diseases, the body’s immune system mistakenly attacks the healthy cells. Scientists are yet to find the reason behind this abnormality. However, the incidence of autoimmune diseases is on the rise. There are multiple types of autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis (“RA”), psoriasis, multiple sclerosis (“MS”), inflammatory bowel disease (“IBD”), etc. Several companies are dedicated to bringing better drugs for the treatment of these diseases. The symptoms include fatigue, muscle aches, swelling, and redness in the affected body parts.The most common and first-line treatment for autoimmune disease is disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), especially methotrexate. Apart from methotrexate, there are several classes of DMARDs including TNF inhibitor therapies approved for these diseases that are performing well. AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Humira and Amgen’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) Enbrel are blockbuster TNF inhibitor drugs among others. However, these treatments have serious safety issues which include increased risk tuberculosis and lymphoma among others.JAK InhibitorsSeveral pharma companies are developing JAK inhibitors, which work by blocking a particular signal of a body’s immune response, cytokines, instead of suppressing the immune system as done by DMARDs. Patients treated with JAK-inhibitors in clinical studies have shown faster and better response to the disease. However, the safety concern still looms large. The segment is attractive for companies as there are only two JAK inhibitors, presently approved for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, especially RA. However, several companies are developing their candidates, which is likely to increase competition going forward.The segment was in news recently as Eli Lilly’s (LLY  -  Free Report) Olumiant, a JAK inhibitor, received approval in the United States and AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) announced top-line data from a late-stage study evaluating its JAK inhibitor candidate,upadacitinib.4 Pharma/Biotech Companies in FocusGiven the growing interest in JAK inhibitors, let’s take a look at some pharma and biotech companies that are looking to change the way autoimmune diseases are treated.Pfizer’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Xeljanz (tofacitinib) is the first approved JAK-inhibitor in the United States for the treatment of RA. It has been available in the market since 2012. The drug is also approved for psoriatic arthritis. It generated sales of $326 million in the first quarter of 2018, up 30.4% year over year. A regulatory application seeking line extension of the drug in ulcerative colitis was approved late last month in the United States. Regulatory applications seeking approval in the above three indications are under review in Europe.The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Eli Lilly’s JAK-inhibitor, Olumiant (baricitinib), is the second drug to receive approval for treating RA in the United States. The drug was approved early this month. However, it was launched in certain European countries in 2017. We note that the FDA rejected the company’s new drug application seeking approval of Olumiant in April 2017 citing safety concerns. Lilly develops and commercializes the drug in partnership with Incyte Corporation. The drug generated sales of $32.2 million in the first quarter, sequentially up 40%. Lilly is currently evaluating the drug in another autoimmune indication, atopic dermatitis (eczema), in a late-stage study.The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).AbbVie is another company, which is focused on developing JAK inhibitor based treatments. The company’s JAK inhibitor, upadacitinib, showed promising results in late-stage studies evaluating the candidate in RA patients. It is also being developed for atopic dermatitis in a late-stage study for which it enjoys breakthrough therapy status in the United States. Another late-stage study is evaluating the candidate in Crohn’s disease.The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Galapagos NV (GLPG  -  Free Report) is developing its JAK inhibitor candidate, filgotinib, in collaboration with Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report). Separate late-stage studies are evaluating the candidate in RA, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Moreover, several mid-stage studies are evaluating the candidate in multiple autoimmune indications including ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis and cutaneous lupus erythematosus among others. Data from a mid-stageI study evaluating filgotinib in psoriatic arthritis showed significant improvement in patients.The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Prospects of JAK Inhibitors With several blockbuster DMARDs nearing patent expiration, this new class of drugs holds potential to replace the existing treatments. This boosts the prospects of the companies that have these drugs/candidates in their pipeline or commercial portfolio.However, JAK inhibitors also have several side effects, which may delay their approval. We note that a lower dose of Lilly’s Olumiant was approved along with a boxed warning stating risk of serious infections, malignancies and thrombosis.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

1013,LLY,"Eli Lilly & Company (LLY  -  Free Report) reported first-quarter 2018 adjusted earnings per share of $1.34, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.13 per share by 18.6%. Earnings rose 37% from the year-ago quarter backed by robust volume-driven growth in new product sales and lower operating costs and tax rates.Including asset impairment, restructuring, and other special charges, first-quarter earnings per share were $1.16 against a loss of 10 cents in the first-quarter of 2017.Revenues in DetailQuarterly revenues of $5.70 billion also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.53 billion. Sales grew 9% year over year backed by strong performance of new drugs and favorable currency movement, which made up for lower sales of established products like Strattera, Cialis and Forteo.Volumes rose 2% as increased demand for new products like Trulicity, Cyramza, Taltz, Basaglar, Jardiance and Lartruvo offset decline in sales of some established products. However, volume growth was softer than 4% in the previous quarter.Higher realized prices for several drugs contributed 3% to sales growth in the quarter. Foreign exchange rate also had a favorable impact of 4%.While U.S. revenues grew 8% to $3.16 billion, ex-U.S. revenues rose 11% to $2.55 billion.Pharmaceutical revenues rose 11% in the quarter. However, decreased demand for food animal products continued to hurt sales in Lilly’s Animal Health segment.Established products that recorded growth during the quarter include Humalog (up 12% year over year to $791.7 million), Humulin (up 4% to $325.9 million) and Trajenta (up 25% to $141.1 million). Sales of all other established products declined in the quarter.Forteo sales declined 10% to $313.2 million due to decreased volume from unfavorable wholesale and retail buying patterns in the United States.Cymbalta sales declined 3% to $169.6 million while Erbitux sales declined 3% to $149.6 million.Alimta sales rose 2% to $499.6 million as higher sales in United States offset sales decline in international markets. In ex-U.S. markets, sales declined 3% to $254.3 million due to competitive pressure and loss of exclusivity in certain countries. However, sales of Alimta increased 8% to $245.3 million in the United States due to increased volume and higher realized prices.Zyprexa sales declined 17% to $122.6 million due to loss of exclusivity in Japan.Cialis sales declined 7% to $495.4 million hurt by lower demand in United States and loss of exclusivity in Europe.Strattera sales declined 33% to $130.7 million due to loss of exclusivity.Among the new products, Trulicity generated revenues of $678.3 million, up 82% year over year, with U.S. revenues benefiting from growth in the GLP-1 market and market share gains.Cyramza revenues were $183.6 million, up 7% year over year, backed by strong demand. Cyramza’s ex-U.S. revenues increased 10%, benefiting from strong volumes and currency benefit, partially offset by lower realized prices. U.S. revenues increased 3% driven by increased volume and higher realized prices.Jardiance sales surged 104% to $151 million, driven by increased market share within the growing SGLT2 class in the United States and increased volume outside the United States.Basaglar recorded revenues of $166.0 million compared with $153.8 million in the previous quarter. It generated revenues of $126.7 million in the United States, which improved sequentially driven by increased demand as the drug gained Medicare Part D formulary access.Taltz brought in sales of $146.5 million compared with $172.5 million in the previous quarter as higher ex-U.S. revenues were offset by lower U.S. sales, which were hurt by unfavorable specialty pharmacy buying patterns.Lartruvo (olaratumab) generated revenues of $64.4 million in the quarter compared with $59.0 million in the previous quarter.Olumiant (baricitinib) has been launched in select European countries and in Japan for moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis. The drug generated sales of $32.2 million in the quarter backed by strong launch uptake in Germany, compared with $23.0 million in the previous quarter.The drug is under review in the United States. Lilly and partner Incyte Corporation (INCY  -  Free Report) re-submitted the NDA for baricitinib in January. In a setback to the company, on Monday, Lilly informed that the FDA Advisory Committee has recommended approval of the 2-mg dose of the JAK inhibitor while not recommending the higher dose of 4-mg on the ground that its safety profile is not adequate to support an approval relative to its benefits. The final decision from the FDA is expected in June this year. Please note that in April last year, the FDA had issued a complete response letter (CRL) for the new drug application (NDA) for baricitinib on safety concerns.Verzenio, which was launched in the Unites States in the fourth quarter of 2017, generated sales of $29.7 million in the quarter compared with $21 million in the previous quarter.Elanco Animal Health segment sales declined 1% to $761.3 million due to decreased demand for food animal products.Lilly is exploring strategic alternatives for this business including a sale, merger or creating a separate company through an initial public offer. A decision regarding the same is expected to be announced in July. Lilly might ultimately opt to retain the business.Gross Margin & Operating Income Adjusted gross margin of 75.1% in the quarter decreased 270 basis points as manufacturing efficiencies and higher realized prices were offset by negative product mix and the effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold.Operating income increased 29% year over year to $1.60 billion due to lower operating costs. Total operating expenses (including research and development and marketing, selling and administrative expenses), as a percent of revenues, declined 710 basis points in the quarter to 46.9% due to the company’s cost saving efforts.2018 EPS Guidance UppedLilly raised its previously issued outlook for adjusted earnings as well as sales.Adjusted earnings per share are now expected in the range of $5.10 to $5.20, higher than $4.81 to $4.91 expected previously, to reflect the expected benefit from higher operating profits and lower tax rates.The revenue range was also slightly upped to $23.7 billion to $24.2 billion from $23.0 billion to $23.5 billion expected previously.Gross margin is expected to be approximately 75%, same as previously expected. Adjusted tax rate is expected to be approximately 17% (previously approximately 18%).Marketing, selling and administrative expense guidance was tightened to a range of $6.2–$6.3 billion compared with $6.1–$6.4 billion previously. Research and development expense guidance was slightly increased to a range of $5.2–$5.4 billion compared with $5.0–$5.2 billion previously due to increased funding requirement for pipeline development.Our TakeLilly’s first-quarter results were impressive as it beat estimates for both earnings and sales and also raised its 2018 guidance for both metrics. Shares of the drug giant rose more than 2% in pre-market trading.However, year-to-date, Lilly’s shares have declined 5% compared with the industry’s decline of 4.7%.Going forward, Lilly’s new products like Trulicity, Taltz, Basaglar, Cyramza, Jardiance, Lartruvo, Verzenio and Olumiant are expected to continue to drive revenues.However, competitive pressure on Lilly’s drugs is expected to rise this year. Challenges remain for the company in the form of loss of patent exclusivity for products like Cialis this year and the impact of generic competition for Strattera, Effient and Axiron. The latest baricitinib setback was a disappointment.Lilly carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1014,LLY,"Eli Lilly and Company’s (LLY  -  Free Report) announced that a late-stage study evaluating its already approved cancer drug, Cyramza for the second-line treatment of liver cancer met the primary as well as secondary endpoint.While the primary endpoint was overall survival (OS) — the percentage of patients who are alive after a certain length of time —  the secondary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), the amount of time the patients live without their tumors growing larger.The phase III REACH -2 study evaluated the benefit of Cyramza as a single agent in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), also known as liver cancer, who were intolerant to or experienced disease progression after treatment with Bayer (BAYRY  -  Free Report)/Amgen’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) Nexavar and also had elevated levels of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). According to Lilly’s press release, approximately half of all advanced HCC patients have a high AFP, a marker of poor prognosis.The results from the REACH – 2 study showed that such patients derived a survival benefit with Cyramza treatment following first-line treatment with Nexavar.Please note that Cyramza is already marketed as a single agent and in combination with another agent as a second-line treatment of advanced or metastatic gastric cancer. It is also approved for use in combination with another agent as a second-line treatment of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer and metastatic colorectal cancer.Lilly plans to file regulatory applications seeking label expansion of Cyramza for the specified subgroup of liver cancer patient population by mid-2018.Many cancer drugs are being approved based on progression free survival without evidence of benefit in survival or quality of life. However, OS data, once available, sometimes shows that the drug does not help people live longer. The fact that Cyramza offered an overall survival benefit in the REACH -2 study probably impressed investors, which led the stock to rise 1.4% on Wednesday. However, this year so far, Lilly’s shares have declined 6.2%, comparing unfavorably with the industry’s decrease of 3.1%.Cyramza generated revenues of $758.3 million in 2017, recording a year-over-year increase of 23%. Meanwhile, Cyramza is being evaluated in several studies for additional indicationsPhase III studies of Cyramza in advanced urothelial carcinoma and first-line EGFR mutation positive NSCLC are ongoing. While OS data from urothelial carcinoma study is expected in the first half of the year, PFS data from the EGFR mutation positive NSCLC study is expected to be released in late 2018.In December, Lilly announced top-line data from a phase III study – RAINFALL – evaluating Cyramza as first-line treatment for patients with advanced gastric cancer. The study met its primary endpoint of PFS but failed to improve OS. Lilly decided not to seek regulatory approval in the first-line setting based on the data from this study.Lilly carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1015,LLY,"The FDA’s refusal to review Alkermes plc’s (ALKS  -  Free Report) depression candidate ALKS 5461 this week was a major setback for the company. The decision sent Alkermes’ stock tumbling more than 21%.ALKS 5461, a once-daily oral medication has been developed for the adjunctivetreatment of major depressive disorder (“MDD”) in patients, who have not responded to standard antidepressant therapies.The FDA refused to review the candidate stating that the new drug application (“NDA”) did not have enough evidence that the oral medication will work. The FDAwas of the opinion that additional studies should be conducted to ascertain the drug’s effectiveness for the proposed indication.It goes without saying that unexpected pipeline setbacks like these, shift investors’ focus to companies that market or are developing drugs for the treatment of depression. Alkermes’ latest pipeline setback has shifted investors’ focus to this market. Depression and Types Depression is a medical condition that affects the brain. Individuals with depression feel melancholic and have intricacy in enjoying routine activities. Factors such as stress and brain chemistry are the most common causes of depression. It can also be genetic.There are different forms of depression such as persistent depressive disorder, perinatal depression disorder, psychotic depression, seasonal affective disorder and bipolar depression. Psychotic depression, persistent depressive disorder and bipolar disorder are the most severe forms of depression. According to WHO as of May 30, 2016, an estimated 350 million people worldwide are affected by depression and have been seen to carry suicidal tendencies. Thus, there rose a pressing need to develop drugs for this condition. Known as antidepressants, these drugs are instrumental in identifying the signs and symptoms of the ailment.Several pharma and biotech companies are involved in developing and selling of anti-depressantdrugs.4 Stocks in FocusLet us look at some of the companies that are actively pursuing the development of treatment for various types of depression.Allergan plc (AGN  -  Free Report): This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, looks well-positioned in the depression market. The company has quite a few products in its portfolio including Vraylar (schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder), Viibryd (major depressive disorder) and Saphris (bipolar I disorder). These drugs are also in several label expansion studies. Earlier this week, Allergan announced that a pivotal study evaluating Vraylar for the treatment of adults with major depressive episodes associated with bipolar I disorder (bipolar I depression) met the primary endpoint.Moreover, Allergan moved rapastinel, its NMDA receptor modulator, into phase III development for major depressive disorder. Rapastinel, a potentially game-changing treatment, is expected to be launched in 2021. The drug is expected to generate revenues of $1-$2 billion. Rapastinel was granted breakthrough therapy status for adjunction major depressive disorder by the FDA in 2016.Allergan is also evaluating its flagship product, Botox, for the treatment of major depressive disorder. Allergan has outperformed the industry year to date. The company’s shares have moved up 1.7% against the industry decline of 4.7%.Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report): Healthcare giant, J&J has a strong presence in the neuroscience segment, which is one of its core therapeutic areas. While the company has products like Risperdal Consta (schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder) in its portfolio, one of the most promising candidates in J&J’s pipeline is esketamine, an investigational antidepressant medication with blockbuster potential. Esketamine, an NMDA receptor antagonist, which has a novel mechanism of action, got breakthrough therapy designation from the FDA for major depressive disorder with imminent risk for suicide in 2016. Esketamine has been granted breakthrough therapy designation for treatment-resistant depression and a regulatory application for this indication in the United States is expected to be filed this year.J&J, a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock, has underperformed the industry year to date. The company’s stock has lost 6.7% compared with the industry decline of 3.3%.

1017,LLY,"Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) and partner Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has approved their pipeline candidate Aimovig (erenumab) for the prevention of migraine.The drug is the first FDA-approved treatment, specifically developed to treat migraine by blocking calcitonin gene-related peptide (""CGRP"") receptor. Aimovig will be available in a pre-filled self-administering autoinjector, SureClick, for a once monthly 70 mg dosage. Aimovig is under review in the EU.Amgen’s shares were up 1.3% in after-hours trading following the announcement. Year to date, Amgen’s shares have increased 0.4% compared with the industry’s decline of 9.9%.Aimovig’s approval is backed by positive data from several mid and late stage studies. The drug significantly reduced monthly migraine days and use of acute migraine medications versus placebo in studies. Data from a phase IIIb LIBERTY study in episodic migraine patients who failed two to four prior treatments showed that Aimovig has three times higher probability of reducing migraine days by half compared to placebo.New treatment options, specifically developed to treat migraine, are making their way, suggesting potential demand for Aimovig. Amgen has priced the drug at $575 for a once monthly 70 or 140 mg single-use prefilled SureClick autoinjector or $6,900 annually. We expect the drug to boost Amgen’s top line going forward.We remind investors that Eli Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (TEVA  -  Free Report) also have anti-CGRP candidates, galcanezumab and fremanezumab, respectively, which are under review in the United States.A decision on galcanezumab is expected in the third quarter of the yearA FDA decision on fremanezumab was expected in June. However, earlier this month, Teva informed that it does not expect to get FDA approval for fremanezumab on its PDUFA date in June. This is because Teva’s manufacturing partner for fremanezumab, Celltrion, which makes the API, received a warning letter from the FDA this year that delayed the approval of the drug. However, Teva expects fremanezumab to be approved and launched before the end of this year.Amgen Inc. Price  Amgen Inc. Price | Amgen Inc. QuoteAmgen currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1018,LLY,"Roche Holding AG (RHHBY  -  Free Report) announced encouraging interim data from a phase III study – IMpower150 – evaluating Tecentriq combination regimen for the first-line treatment of metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (""NSCLC""). Data showed that its immuno-oncology drug, Tecentriq, in combination with its another blockbuster cancer drug Avastin plus carboplatin and paclitaxel, significantly improved median overall survival (“OS”) rate by 4.5 months compared to Avastin plus chemotherapies.The Tecentriq combination regimen showed survival benefit in key lung cancer populations such as people with EGFR- and ALK-positive mutations and those with liver metastases and those with varying levels of PD-L1 expression.In November last year, Roche’s IMpower 150 study met the co-primary endpoint of progression free survival (“PFS”) benefit. In March this year Roche announced that the study also met its another primary endpoint of median OS. However, Roche did not provide any OS numbers.Detailed data from the study will be presented at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (""ASCO"") early next month.We remind investors that the combination regimen is already under priority review in the United States for this indication in the first-line setting. A supplemental Biologics License Application was filed based on PFS and OS data from the IMpower 150 study. A decision is expected on Sep 5, 2018. The positive data from the IMpower150 study is likely to boost prospects of a favorable decision by the FDA. The drug is approved for NSCLC in second-line setting.We note that Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda is the only immuno-oncology drug approved alone or in combination with Eli Lilly’s (LLY  -  Free Report) Alimta (pemetrexed) and carboplatin for treating NSCLC patients in first-line setting.Shares of Roche have lost 10.3% year to date compared with the industry’s decline of 4%.The IMpower150 study consisted of three cohorts, evaluating Tecentriq in combination with Avastin, carboplatin and paclitaxel, Tecentriq in combination with only carboplatin and paclitaxel, and Avastin plus carboplatin and paclitaxel in NSCLC patients. Data showed that the Tecentriq-Avastin arm achieved median OS, a co-primary endpoint, of 19.2 months compared with 14.7 months for Avastin arm.However, Tecentriq plus chemotherapies did not achieve any statistically significant improvement in OS compared to Avastin plus chemotherapies.Roche is evaluating Tecentriq as monotherapy or in combination regimens in eight late-stage studies including IMpower 150.In a separate press release, Roche announced follow-up data from the phase III ALEX study comparing Alecensa to Pfizer’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Xalkori (crizotinib) in treatment-naive ALK-positive NSCLC patients. Data from the study demonstrated long-term PFS benefit when treated with Alecensa with median PFS almost tripling to 34.8 months compared to 10.9 months for Xalkori.Roche Holding AG Price  Roche Holding AG Price | Roche Holding AG QuoteZacks RankRoche currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1019,LLY,"Eli Lilly & Company’s (LLY  -  Free Report) pipeline candidate, galcanezumab met its primary as well as secondary endpoint in a late-stage study evaluating it for the prevention of episodic cluster headache.The study (n=106) showed that treatment with galcanezumab(300 mg once-monthly) led to statistically significant differences in the reduction of weekly cluster headache attacks compared to placebo across weeks one to three of the two-month treatment period — the primary endpoint. Meanwhile, at week 3, a statistically significantly greater percentage of patients in the galcanezumab arm achieved at least a 50% reduction in weekly cluster headache attacks (secondary endpoint) compared to placebo. Safety and tolerability were consistent with previous studies evaluating galcanezumab for migraine prevention. Lilly said it will work with regulatory authorities to determine the best path forward for the candidate.However, a separate phase III study (n=237) evaluating galcanezumab in patients with chronic cluster headache did not meet the primary endpoint. According to Lilly’s press release, chronic cluster headache represents 10% to 15% of cluster headache cases. Episodic cluster headache accounts for 85%-90% of the cluster headache market.Galcanezumab is already under review in the United States for migraine prevention with a decision expected in the third quarter of the year.Galcanezumab uses calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) antibody for the prevention of migraine. Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) and partner Novartis’ (NVS  -  Free Report) Aimvog/erenumab and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited’s (TEVA  -  Free Report) fremanezumab have been developed for chronic/episodic migraine prevention using anti-CGRP mechanism and are also under review in the United States. A FDA decision on fremanezumab was expected in June. However, earlier this month, Teva informed that it does not expect to get FDA approval for fremanezumab on its PDUFA date in June. This is because Teva’s manufacturing partner for fremanezumab, Celltrion, which makes the API, received a warning letter from the FDA this year that delayed the approval of the drug. However, Teva expects fremanezumab to be approved and launched before the end of this year.Meanwhile, the FDA action date for Amgen’s CGRP antibody, Aimovig, for the prevention of migraine, is May 17. Amgen looks confident to gain FDA approval, which will make it the first medicine in the CGRP class to get approval.Year to date, Lilly’s shares have declined 2.6% compared with the industry’s decline of 2.9%. Lilly currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1021,LLY,"This week was ruled by cancer data presentations at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (“ASCO”) in Chicago by pharma bigwigs like Bristol Myers (BMY  -  Free Report), Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) and Roche (RHHBY  -  Free Report), among others. JAK inhibitors were in the news this week with Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) finally gaining FDA approval for its rheumatoid arthritis (“RA”) candidate Olumiant (baricitinib) in the United States while AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) presented positive top-line data from its fifth late-stage study on upadacitinib in RA.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesUpdate from ASCO: Merck stole the show at ASCO after presenting data from several cancer studies of its PD-L1 inhibitor, Keytruda. Key presentations were from two pivotal lung cancer trials. KEYNOTE-042 study evaluated Keytruda monotherapy in newly-diagnosed lung cancer patients while KEYNOTE-407 study evaluated Keytruda in combination with chemotherapy in difficult-to treat squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Both the studies showed that treatment with Keytruda led to improved survival. Particularly, data from the KEYNOTE- 407 study, which evaluated Keytruda in combination with chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of metastatic squamous NSCLC was considered “practice changing” by investors.Four and five years follow-up data presented from two advanced melanoma studies showed that treatment with Keytruda led to long-term survival benefit. Interim data from a cohort of a phase II study, KEYNOTE-158, evaluating Keytruda as a monotherapy in patients with previously treated advanced small cell lung cancer (SCLC) demonstrated encouraging response rates in the overall population of SCLC patients as well as in patients whose tumors express PD-L1. Keytruda also demonstrated encouraging ORR in studies evaluating the Lenvima/Keytruda combination in four different tumor types and Keytruda monotherapy for the first-line treatment of advanced clear cell RCC.Bristol-Myers and Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR) presented preliminary data from a mid-stage study evaluating NKTR-214 in combination with Bristol-Myers’PD-L1 inhibitor, Opdivo in several tumor types. The response rates in melanoma and kidney cancer patients did not impress investors, resulting in a 42% drop in Nektar’s stock on Monday.  (Read more: Nektar and Bristol-Myers Present Data on Cancer Study)Bristol-Myers also presented data on Opdivo at ASCO. In a late-stage study evaluating Opdivo versus Yervoy in a broad range of patients with resected stage III or IV melanoma, Opdivo demonstrated sustained, superior recurrence-free survival versus Yervoy. In another study, Opdivo plus chemotherapy showed improved PFS versus chemotherapy in first-line lung cancer patients with PD-L1 expression <1%.Novartis (NVS) announced positive data from a combination study on breast cancer drug Kisqali and from two long-term leukemia studies on Tasigna. (Read more: Novartis Announces Positive Data on Kisqali and Tasigna).Roche presented data from a late-stage study, which showed that Tecentriq (atezolizumab) plus chemotherapy reduced the risk of disease worsening or death (PFS) by 29% in advanced squamous NSCLC patients versus chemotherapy alone.AbbVie presented early data from a phase II study evaluating a combination of its cancer drugs Imbruvica plus Venclexta (venetoclax) for the first-line treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The data demonstrated high rates of responses in such patients. Also, interim data from a late-stage study evaluating Imbruvica plus Roche’s Rituxan in Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia, a rare form of Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, showed that the combination significantly reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 80% compared to placebo plus Rituxan.Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report), AstraZeneca and J&J also made some cancer data presentations at the meeting.Lilly Gets FDA Nod for Lower Dose of Olumiant: Eli Lilly and partner Incyte gained FDA approval for the lower dose of (2 mg) of the companies’ JAK inhibitor, Olumiant. The FDA did not approve the higher dose (4 mg) and the drug’s label was approved with a boxed warning stating risk of serious infections, malignancies and thrombosis. Olumiant is already marketed in Europe and Japan and generated sales of $32.2 million in the first quarter of 2018. In the United States, Lilly faced significant trouble in getting FDA nod for Olumiant. In April last year, the FDA had issued a complete response letter for the new drug application seeking approval of Olumiant, requesting additional information to determine the most appropriate doses. This year in April, an FDA advisory committee had recommended approval of the lower dose of the drug while not recommending the higher dose of 4 mg on inadequate safety profile to support an approval relative to its benefits. (Read more: Eli Lilly's Olumiant Gets FDA Nod for Rheumatoid Arthritis).AbbVie’s 5th Late-Stage Upadacitinib Study Succeeds: AbbVie’s oral JAK-1 selective inhibitor, upadacitinib, met all primary as well as secondary endpoints in the fifth phase III study from its SELECT program. Top-line data from the study showed thata significantly higher proportion of patients treated with upadacitinib in both 15 and 30 mg doses achieved superior responses compared to chemotherapy agent methotrexate. AbbVie plans to submit regulatory applications for upadacitinib in rheumatoid arthritis in the second half of the year.  (Read more: Abbvie’s Upadacitinib Fifth RA Study Data Positive)Allergan Under Activist Pressure to Split CEO-Chairman Roles: Allergan (AGN  -  Free Report) was under pressure this week after two hedge-fund firms, Senator Investment Group and Appaloosa, disclosed a letter urging the company to engage in a management and board overhaul. The firms asked the pharmaceutical company to split its chairman and chief executive roles, both presently held by Brent Saunders, among other management changes. Appaloosa run by David Tepper and Senator Investment Group run by Douglas Silverman, suggested an outsider should be hired for either of the roles. The letter comes on the heels of Allergan’s strategic plan announced last week to divest its women's health and infectious disease units. Allergan responded by saying that the board has been refreshed with the addition of three members in the last 16 months. (Read more: Allergan Requests Shareholders to Veto Management Change).Glaxo Completes Buyout of Novartis’ Stake in Consumer Healthcare JV: Glaxo announced that it has completed its previously announced deal to buy out Novartis’ 36.5% stake in the Consumer HealthCare joint venture for $13 billion (£9.2 billion),With the acquisition of Novartis’ stake, Glaxo now has 100% ownership of its Consumer Healthcare unit, which includes products such as Sensodyne and Flonase. Glaxo and Novartis created the JV in 2015 as part of a three-part transaction between the two companies by combining their consumer divisions.Pfizer to Invest More in Venture Capital Arm: : Pfizer plans to invest $600 million in its venture capital arm, Pfizer Ventures which will be invested in small biotechs and other emerging growth companies. About 150 million will be earmarked for companies involved in promising early-stage neuroscience research. (Read more: Pfizer Boosts Venture Capital Efforts, Neuroscience in Focus)Meanwhile, Pfizer’s regulatory applications for orally-available PARP inhibitor, talazoparib, for metastatic breast cancer patients with an inherited BRCA mutation, were accepted for review by the FDA and the European Medicines Agency. In the United States, the new drug application (NDA) was granted priority review by the FDA with a decision accepted in December this year.Top-line results from talazoparib’s registrational study, EMBRACA, in germline-BRCA mutated breast cancer, presented in December 2017 demonstrated superiority of talazoparib over chemotherapy in improving progression free survival.Roche’s Haemophilia A Candidate Gets Priority Review: Roche’s sBLA looking for label expansion of its drug, Hemlibra for people with haemophilia A without factor VIII inhibitors was granted priority review by the FDA. Hemlibra is presently marketed for routine prophylaxis to prevent or reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes in haemophilia A patients with factor VIII inhibitors.

1022,LLY,"Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) is stealing the limelight at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) in Chicago. After presenting “practice changing” lung cancer data on its PD-L1 inhibitor, Keytruda, the drug giant presented encouraging data from studies evaluating the drug in advanced melanoma and small cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients.Shares of Merck were up 2.4% on Monday in response to the positive news. This year so far, Merck’s shares have outperformed the industry. Its shares have risen 10.2% in the period against the industry’s decline of 4.5%.Four and five years follow-up data presented from two pivotal advanced melanoma studies showed that treatment with Keytruda led to long-term survival benefit.A new analysis of four-year data from the phase III KEYNOTE-006 study showed that 86% of the advanced melanoma patients remained progression free, 20 months after completing two years of treatment with Keytruda.Five-year data from the melanoma cohort of the phase Ib KEYNOTE-001 study demonstrated significant survival benefits in advanced melanoma patients. The five-year OS rate, a secondary endpoint for the study, was 34% in all patients and 41% in previously untreated metastatic melanoma patients.Interim data from a cohort of a phase II study, KEYNOTE-158, evaluating Keytruda as a monotherapy in patients with previously treated advanced small cell lung cancer (SCLC) demonstrated encouraging response rates in the overall population of SCLC patients as well as in patients whose tumors express PD-L1. In the overall population of SCLC patients, overall response rate (ORR – primary endpoint) was 18.7%, while in patients whose tumors expressed PD-L1, ORR was 35.7%.Keytruda is being evaluated in combination with chemotherapy as a first-line treatment in patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer in another phase III study, KEYNOTE-604.Earlier at ASCO, Merck presented data from two pivotal lung cancer trials — KEYNOTE-042 study evaluating Keytruda monotherapy in newly-diagnosed lung cancer patients and KEYNOTE- 407 study evaluating Keytruda in combination with chemotherapy in difficult-to treat squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Both the studies showed that treatment with Keytruda led to improved survival, further cementing Merck’s position in the lung cancer market, which is the most lucrative oncology sector.Meanwhile, Keytruda also demonstrated encouraging ORR in studies evaluating the Lenvima/Keytruda combination in four different tumor types and Keytruda monotherapy for the first-line treatment of advanced clear cell RCC.Keytruda holds a dominant position in lung cancer as it is the only anti-PD-1 approved in first-line setting for certain lung cancer patients both as a monotherapy as well as a combination therapy with Eli Lilly’s (LLY  -  Free Report) cancer drug, Alimta (pemetrexed) and carboplatin (pem/carbo). In fact, Keytruda sales are gaining particularly from strong momentum in the first-line lung cancer indication.Meanwhile, Keytruda is being evaluated in several lung cancer studies across multiple settings and stages of the disease, both as a monotherapy as well as a combination therapy.Keytruda is being studied for more than 30 types of cancer in more than 700 studies, including in excess of 400 combination studies. Merck is collaborating with several companies including Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report), Incyte, Glaxo (GSK  -  Free Report) and Pfizer separately for the evaluation of Keytruda in combination with other regimens.Merck currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1023,LLY,"Shares of ImmunoGen, Inc. (IMGN  -  Free Report) have shot up 157.9% in a year’s time, massively outperforming the industry’s 7.8% increase. Let’s analyze the factors that led to this skyrocketing rally. ImmunoGen’s rapid pipeline progress along with positive readouts and strategic collaborations consistently drove its share price performance.The company made significant advancement with regards to its lead pipeline candidate, mirvetuximab soravtansine, in the last 12 months. It is being evaluated in a phase III study (FORWARD I) as a single-agent therapy for treating patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.ImmunoGenactivated more than 90 sites for study enrolment in the third quarter of 2017, aiming to complete it by the middle of 2018. The readout on the primary endpoint is anticipated in the first half of 2019. Also, the candidate is being evaluated in three phase I expansion cohorts on 113 ovarian cancer patients.An FDA nod for mirvetuximab soravtansine would be a huge boost to ImmunoGen, given its immense commercial potential in the target market. Ovarian cancer causes maximum annual deaths among gynecologic cancers with majority of patients diagnosed at an advanced stage.Meanwhile, combination regimens with mirvetuximab soravtansine for ovarian cancer are also being examined in phase Ib/II FORWARD II study. The trial consists of cohorts assessing mirvetuximab soravtansine in combination with Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Avastin and Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda.In May 2017, ImmunoGen had reported initial results from FORWARD II study, showing mirvetuximab soravtansine with potential to complement the currently available therapies for the indication. Approval for any of these combo therapies will significantly expand the eligible patient population for mirvetuximab soravtansine.Apart from mirvetuximab soravtansine, ImmunoGen is working to develop a couple of early-stage candidates including IMGN779 and IMGN632. In December 2017, ImmunoGen presented positive findings from the ongoing phase I study, evaluating IMGN779 on patients with relapsed or refractory adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) at the annual meeting of American Society of Hematology. Moreover, this January, the company moved IMGN632 into phase I study to treat hematological malignancies including AML.It is also important to note that ImmunoGen signed agreements with several big healthcare players including Amgen, Bayer, Eli Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report), Novartis, Roche, Sanofi and Takeda. By dint of these contracts, other companies are allowed to use ImmunoGen’s antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) technology and provide it with funds in the form of license and milestone fees, royalties, clinical materials revenues plus R&D (research and development) support fees.  Although the platinum-resistant ovarian cancer market offers immense commercial potential, ImmunoGen is notably set to face intense competition upon approval. However, mirvetuximab soravtansine looks promising at this juncture and its approval will lend a big boost to the company.ImmunoGen, Inc. Price ImmunoGen, Inc. Price | ImmunoGen, Inc.

1024,LLY,"Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) has announced that its supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for its PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor, Opdivo (nivolumab), in combination with Yervoy (ipilimumab) has been accepted by the FDA under priority review.The company seeks an approval for label expansion of the combination therapy for addressing patients, previously treated with microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). A response from the regulatory body is awaited on Jul 10, 2018.The Opdivo/Yervoy combo regimen has also been granted a Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the FDA for the aforementioned indication.Notably, Opdivo acquires a nod in several countries including the United States, the EU and Japan for several cancer indications.Shares of the company have rallied 11.7% in the past year, outperforming the industry’s gain of 3.4%. The acceptance of the application was based on positive data from Phase II CheckMate-142 study, announced in January 2018, evaluating the combination therapy for the given indication.Results from the study showed that the primary endpoint of objective response rate per investigator assessment was 55% with a median follow-up of 13.4 months. The overall survival rate at one year was 85% and the median OS was not yet reached. The outcomes showed that Opdivo plus Yervoy provide a durable clinical relief in patients with dMMR or MSI-H metastatic colorectal cancer.The data demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in key patient reports including symptoms, functioning and quality of life.Significantly, this combination procedure is also under assessment in a phase III, Checkmate-227 trial as a first-line treatment for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Last month, Bristol Myers announced positive data from the program, reflecting superior progression-free survival in first-line NSCLC patients compared with chemotherapy. This is the first study to examine combination regimes of two immune-oncology drugs in first line NSCLC patients with high tumor mutation burden.Per the company’s press release, colorectal is one of the most common cancer types and the third leading cause for terminal disease-related deaths in the United States. Approximately, 140,000 new cases of CRC are expected to be diagnosed annually in the country. Moreover, patients with MSI-H or dMMR metastatic CRC have mild possibility to benefit from conventional chemotherapy treatment. Hence, approval of this combo treatment will provide the company with access to a huge patient-population base, in need of an alternative treatment option to apprehend the disease.However, Bristol-Myers faces a fierce competitive pressure in the immuno-oncology space. In fact, Opdivo battles against stiff rivalry from Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) anti-PD-1 immunotherapy Keytruda and Roche’s Tecentriq. Merck’s Keytruda is also being analyzed in a phase III study for CRC. Hence, label expansion of Opdivo/Yervoy combination will lend the company a wider population base of patients for Opdivo.A few approved drugs to treat patients with CRC are Lilly’s (LLY  -  Free Report) Cyramza, Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Avastin and Amgen’s Vectibix.Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Price Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Price | Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Quote Zacks RankBristol-Myers carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1025,LLY,"Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) along with its partner Incyte Corporation (INCY  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has approved the 2 mg dose of Olumiant (baricitinib) for treating moderately-to-severely active rheumatoid arthritis (“RA”). The once-daily oral JAK inhibitor is approved as monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate for treating adult patients with inadequate response to tumor necrosis factor (“TNF”) inhibitor therapies.The approval in the United States was not much of a surprise considering that an FDA advisory committee had recommended approval of the lower dose of the drug in April. However, the 4 mg dose of the drug was not approved.Moreover, the drug’s label includes a boxed warning stating risk of serious infections, malignancies and thrombosis.The companies expect to launch the drug by the end of the second quarter. It will be available at a price 60% lower than the leading TNF inhibitors approved for RA, which includes AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Humira and Amgen’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) Enbrel among others.We remind investors that the FDA had issued a Complete Response Letter in April 2017 for the new drug application seeking approval of Olumiant, requesting additional information to determine the most appropriate doses.Olumiant is already approved in Europe and Japan and generated sales of $32.2 million in the first quarter of 2018. The U.S. approval will further boost the sales of the drug.Lilly’s share price has increased 0.5% year to date compared with the industry’s decline of 4.4%.The approval was based on data from RA-BEACON study, which evaluated Olumiant in combination with disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs versus placebo. Data showed that 49% of the patients treated with Olumiant achieved improvement in the signs and symptoms of RA compared to placebo (27%).The companies will conduct a long-term safety study of Olumiant in RA patients as part of the approval.Following approval in the United States, Incyte is now eligible to receive a milestone payment of $100 million from Lilly, which it expects to record in full in the second quarter of 2018.Olumiant is also being evaluated in a late-stage study for the treatment of atopic dermatitis.Eli Lilly and Company Price  Eli Lilly and Company Price | Eli Lilly and Company QuoteLilly currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1026,LLY,"Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR  -  Free Report) reported a loss of 60 cents per share for the first quarter of 2018, which was wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 52 cents and the year-ago figure of 42 cents due to higher R&D costs.Nektar’s stock was up 2.8% on May 11 following the earnings release. Shares of Nektar have outperformed the industry so far this year. The stock has risen 33% while the industry is up 0.6%.Quarterly revenues soared 53.8% from the year-ago period to $38 million. This upside can mainly be attributed to a $10 million milestone payment under the collaboration agreement with Shire plc (SHPG  -  Free Report) related to the approval of hemophilia drug, Adynovi, in Europe. The top line came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Quarter in DetailThe top line comprised product sales, royalty revenues, non-cash royalty revenues besides license, collaboration and other revenues.In the first quarter, product sales rose 32.4% to $6.3 million from $4.8 million a year ago.  Moreover, non-cash royalty revenues increased 3.9% to $6.9 million.The company reported royalty revenues of $11.1 million in the quarter under review, registering an improvement of 53.5% from $7.2 million a year ago.License, collaboration and other revenues came in at $13.7 million compared with $6.1 million in the prior year, an upside of 125.3%.Research and development (R&D) expenses escalated 62.8% to $99.4 million, primarily due to investments in pipeline including key candidates NKTR-358, NKTR-214 and NKTR-181.General and administrative (G&A) expenses were up 56% to $18.7 million in the reported quarter primarily due to higher stock-based compensation.Pipeline UpdateThe company received a major boost in February when it announced a global strategic collaboration agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY  -  Free Report). Per the agreement, the companies will jointly develop and commercialize Nektar’s lead immuno-oncology candidate, NKTR-214, in combination with Bristol-Myers’ Opdivo (nivolumab) and Opdivo plus Yervoy (ipilimumab).Moreover, pursuant to the contract, the company received $1.0 billion in upfront payment and proceeds of $850 million from share purchase in April.In the same month, Nektar began dosing in a phase I/II study – REVEAL – to evaluate a combination of its two candidates NKTR-262, a toll-like receptor agonist, and NKTR-214, an immuno-stimulatory CD122-biased agonist, in advanced or metastatic solid tumor cancers.Moreover, the company has also collaborated with Takeda to develop NKTR-214 in combination with the latter’s TAK-659, a dual SYK and FLT-3 inhibitor, in liquid and solid tumors. First study under this collaboration is expected to start in the second half of 2018, which will evaluate the combination in non-Hodgkin lymphoma.In May, Nektar initiated a dose ranging phase Ib study to evaluate NKTR-358, a regulatory T cell stimulator, in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, an autoimmune disease. The company has a worldwide license agreement with Eli Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) related to the development of NKTR-358.Apart from these, the company’s pipeline includes two late stage candidates, Onzeald and NKTR-181.Onzeald is currently under evaluation in a phase III (ATTAIN) study for the treatment of adults with advanced breast cancer, having brain metastases. The company is developing NKTR-181 for the treatment of chronic pain. A new drug application is expected to be filed with the FDA this month.Nektar Therapeutics Price and EPS Surprise  Nektar Therapeutics Price and EPS Surprise | Nektar Therapeutics QuoteZacks RankNektar carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

1027,LLY,"AstraZeneca, plc’s (AZN  -  Free Report) new asthma drug, Fasenra (benralizumab) did not meet the primary endpoint in a late-stage study evaluating the respiratory biologic medicine for an expanded indication - chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).Fasenra was approved in the EU in January and in the United States in November last year as an add-on maintenance treatment in patients with severe eosinophilic asthma. Fasenra is given as a fixed-dose subcutaneous injection via a prefilled syringe, once in every eight weeks, making it the first respiratory biologic medicine to be approved in the United States and the EU with the convenient 8-week maintenance dosing schedule. GlaxoSmithKline’s (GSK  -  Free Report) Nucala (subcutaneous administration) and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries' (TEVA  -  Free Report) Cinqair (intravenous infusion) are presently marketed for the same indication but administered once every four weeks.Coming back to the latest news, the phase III study, GALATHEA, evaluated the safety and efficacy of Fasenra in patients with moderate to very severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Top-line results from the study showed that treatment with Fasenra, as an add-on to dual or triple inhaled therapy in COPD patients with a history of exacerbations across a range of baseline blood eosinophils, did not result in a statistically-significant reduction of exacerbations compared to placebo.Full data from the pivotal GALATHEA study is expected to be presented at a future medical meeting. Another pivotal study, TERRANOVA, is also evaluating Fasenra for a similar indication. AstraZeneca will determine the next steps for Fasenra in COPD after it gets results from the TERRANOVA study and full data from the GALATHEA study.AstraZeneca’s shares have risen 4.9% so far this year against the industry’s decline of 3.4%.AstraZeneca currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1028,LLY,"Celldex Therapeutics, Inc. (CLDX  -  Free Report) incurred first-quarter 2018 loss (excluding goodwill impairment charges) of 19 cents per share, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 17 cents but narrower than the year-ago loss of 28 cents. Lower costs and higher revenues led to the year-over-year improvement.Total revenues in the quarter soared 165% year over year to $4.1 million, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.03 million. The manufacturing service agreement with the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative and Frontier Biotechnologies drove the top line.Shares of the company fell 6.5% on May 10 on the wider-than-expected loss and discontinuation of development of three candidates including earlier announced glembatumumab vedotin.However, the stock has not done too well so far this year. It has declined 74.6% compared with the industry’s 11.3% decrease. Quarterly DetailsResearch and development expenses were down 15.1% year over year to $21.9 million during the quarter. General and administrative expenses were $5.6 million, down 22.2% year over year.As of Mar 31, 2017, Celldex had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $123.2 million compared with $139.4 million as of Mar 31, 2018. The biotech company’s weakened cash position was due to higher operating expense, partially offset by net proceeds raised from sales of its common stock this month under a contract with Cantor.2018 OutlookCelldex expects that its cash position as of the end of December plus $6.1 million in net proceeds generated from the sale of its common stock in the last two months and the anticipated proceeds from any future sales of common stock under the agreement with Cantor will be adequate to fund the working capital requirements as well as planned operations through 2020.Discontinued Clinical StudiesIn April 2018, the company announced the failure of its antibody drug conjugate (“ADC”) candidate, glembatumumab vedotin in phase IIb METRIC study, evaluating it in breast cancer. Following the failure, the company has decided to discontinue the development of the candidate across all indications, including metastatic melanoma.Apart from glembatumumab vedotin, Celldex announced in its earnings release the discontinuation of development of early phase ADC candidate, CDX-014 and antibody fusion protein candidate, CDX-1401. The company has taken this decision for better allocation of its resources.Pipeline FocusCelldex is now focusing on development of CDX-1140 and CDX-3379. Varlilumab and CDX-301 will be evaluated externally through investigator-sponsored studies. However, the company will evaluate varlilumab and CDX-301 internally in combination studies. There are several preclinical candidates in its pipeline, including CDX-0159.In January 2018, the company closed enrollment for phase II trial, evaluating varlilumab with Bristol-Myers’ (BMY  -  Free Report) Opdivo including cohorts in five indications namely colorectal cancer, ovarian cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma and glioblastoma.A phase II study is currently evaluating CDX-3379, a human monoclonal antibody, in combination with Eli Lilly’s (LLY  -  Free Report) Erbitux for the treatment of advanced head and neck squamous cell cancer.A phase I study is evaluating CDX-1140 in several solid tumors and Celldex is planning to add cohorts to evaluate CDX-1140 in combination with CDX-301 or varlilumab.

1029,LLY,"Roche Holding AG’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) subsidiary Genentech announced that a phase III study, evaluating a combination of its PD-L1 inhibitor Tecentriq (atezolizumab) and Avastin (bevacizumab) plus carboplatin and paclitaxel for first line treatment of advanced lung cancer met its co-primary endpoint of overall survival (OS).The IMpower150 study showed that the patients with advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who were treated with the combination treatment lived longer compared with Avastin plus carboplatin and paclitaxel.The company plans to submit these additional data to global health authorities as well as to the FDA and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) soon.Over a year, shares of Roche have declined 12.3% against the industry’s growth of 2.8%.In December 2017, the company had announced interim results from the IMpower 150 study. The IMpower150 study showed that Tecentriq and Avastin plus chemotherapy reduced the risk of disease worsening or death by 38% compared with those who were treated with Avastin plus chemotherapy. In November 2017, Roche mentioned that the III IMpower150 study met its co-primary endpoint of progression-free survival.Tecentriq is approved for the treatment of second-line metastatic NSCLC. Label expansion in the first line setting should boost the drug’s sales further. Tecentriq is also approved for the treatment of patients suffering from locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC) who are not eligible for cisplatin chemotherapy. The drug recorded sales of CHF457 million in 2017.We remind investors that Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) PD-L1 inhibitor Keytruda is approved by the FDA  both as monotherapy and in combination with Lilly’s  (LLY  -  Free Report) Alimta and carboplatin for the first line treatment of patients with metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC.Roche Holding AG Price Roche Holding AG Price | Roche Holding AG Quote Zacks Rank & Other Stock to ConsiderRoche carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Another top-ranked stock from the same space is Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN  -  Free Report) ,sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

1030,LLY,"The first-quarter 2018 earnings season started on a solid note, showing signs of yet another reporting cycle emerging strong. Per the latest Earnings Preview, 87 S&P 500 members — accounting for 17.4% of the index — have already released financial figures as of Apr 20, 2018.Total earnings for these index participants jumped 25% from the year-ago quarter, driven by 10.7% improved revenues. The beat ratio was 82.8% for the bottom line and 67.8% for the top line.Further good news is that the ongoing earnings phase seems to have also begun encouragingly for the Drug/Biotech sector. Among the major large cap players, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) kicked off the season strongly, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both earnings as well as sales in first-quarter 2018. Another large cap player having reported earnings performance last week is Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report), which also surpassed both earnings and revenue expectations this quarter.We remind investors that though the Drug/biotech sector faced severe volatility since the last couple of months due to broader market pressure, mainly driven by the U.S.-China trade war, the sector is still likely to improve as the year progresses.We expect a surge in new product sales in sync with rising demand. This apart, a successful innovation and product line expansion, strong clinical study results, more frequent FDA approvals, a consistently sturdy performance of key products, growing demand for drugs, especially to address rare-to-treat diseases, an ageing populace and an increased healthcare expenditure are some of the factors that should keep the sector well in place.Also, according to the Earnings Preview, the broader Medical sector (inclusive of drug, biotech as well as Medical Device companies) is likely to record 6.8% year-over-year growth in revenues and a 9.4% rise in earnings in the period under discussion.Three pharma/biotech giants are scheduled to report earnings numbers on Apr 24.

The company delivered a positive surprise of 5.56% last quarter.

Though the company’s favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) increases the predictive power of ESP, its Earnings ESPof -0.48% leaves surprise prediction inconclusive as the company requires a positive ESP to be confident about a probable surprise. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarterly earnings is pegged at $1.13 per share.Lilly’s strong uptake of new products like Trulicity, Taltz, Basaglar, Cyramza, Jardiance and Lartruvo should compensate the sales decline of its established products, namely Zyprexa, Alimta, Cialis, Strattera and Effient. We expect this uptrend to find reflection in the results of the soon-to-be reported quarter. (Read More: Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) to Report Q1 Earnings: What's in the Cards?).Biogen Inc.

1031,LLY,"Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) will report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 24, before market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 5.56%.Lilly’s shares have declined 5.5% this year so far, underperforming the industry 's decrease of 4.3%.Lilly’s performance has been pretty impressive with earnings beating expectations in each of the last four quarters, bringing the average positive surprise to 4.08%.Eli Lilly and Company Price and EPS Surprise  Eli Lilly and Company Price and EPS Surprise | Eli Lilly and Company QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for this quarter.Factors to ConsiderLike the previous couple of quarters, strong uptake trends of new products like Trulicity, Taltz, Basaglar, Cyramza, Jardiance and Lartruvo should make up for the decline in sales of established products like Zyprexa, Alimta, Cialis, Strattera and Effient.While Trulicity sales are being driven by growth in the GLP-1 market and market share gains, Jardiance sales are likely to be driven by increased market share within the growing SGLT2 class. The positive trend is expected to continue in the first quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Trulicity first-quarter revenues is $586 million.Continued strong uptake outside the United States is likely to drive sales of Cyramza. Strong launch uptake is expected to drive sales of Taltz and Lartruvo.The loss of exclusivity in some countries for Cymbalta, Strattera, Effient, Axiron, Zyprexa and Evista will continue to hurt volumes. Also, lower demand in the United States due to competitive pressure mainly from immuno-oncology agents is hurting Alimta sales in the country – a trend which we believe persisted in the first quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Alimta sales in the first quarter is pegged at $466 million.Olumiant (baricitinib) was launched in select European countries and in Japan in 2017 and generated sales of $46 million in the year supported by a strong launch uptake in Germany, The drug is under review in the United States. Lilly and partner Incyte Corporation (INCY  -  Free Report) re-submitted the NDA for baricitinib in January.Verzenio, which was launched in the United States in the fourth quarter of 2017, generated sales of $21 million. We expect the new cancer drug to generate higher sales in the first quarter. Also, this advanced breast cancer treatment gained FDA approval in the first-line setting in February, which might have led to additional sales in the first quarter.Some older products like Humulin and Forteo are expected to do well while others like Cialis are likely to see weak sales due to lower demand.Elanco Animal Health segment sales were hurt by global competitive pressure in 2017, a trend that may have continued in the first quarter. On the fourth-quarter conference call, management had said that after being slightly negative in the first half of 2018, Animal Health revenues are expected to improve in the second half supported by new product launches. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales in the Animal Health segment is $770 million.Lilly is exploring strategic alternatives for this business including a sale, merger or creating a separate company through an initial public offer. A decision regarding the same is expected to be announced in July and Lilly may ultimately opt to retain the business. Investors may look for an update on the first-quarter conference call.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Lilly will beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Its Earnings ESP is -0.08%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is $1.13 per share. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Lilly’s Zacks Rank #2 increases the predictive power of ESP.

1032,LLY,"Amgen Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) has announced full results from the phase IIIb study on its anti-CGRP receptor antibody, Aimovig (erenumab), which once again demonstrates a significant reduction in migraine frequency. The company is looking to get Aimovig (140mg) approved for treatment of episodic migraine in patients with a previous experience of two to four preventive treatment failures due to lack of efficacy or intolerable side effects.The phase III LIBERTY study randomized 246 patients with the aforementioned indication to receive Aimovig 140 mg or placebo for 12-weeks. Data from the study demonstrated reduction in episodic migraines by at least half in 30% of Aimovig treated patients with multiple treatment failures compared with 14% of patients treated with placebo.Moreover, over 97% of Aimovig patients completed the double-blind phase of the LIBERTY trial. No adverse events were found that might lead to discontinuation of treatment in the Aimovig group. Outcomes from the study will be presented at the 70th annual meeting of the American Academy of Neurology in Los Angeles.Shares of Amgen increased more than 2% on Apr 17 following the news release. The stock has gained 0.5% so far this year against the industry's 7.1% decline. We remind investors that in January this year, the company announced that Aimovig met its primary endpoint in the LIBARTY study with significantly more patients under Aimovig’s dosage experiencing at least a 50% reduction from baseline in their monthly migraine days as compared to placebo. The study met its secondary endpoint as well.Notably, Amgen is developing Aimovig in collaboration with Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report). The companies are focused on developing and commercializing the treatments for migraine and Alzheimer's disease. If approved, Amgen and Novartis will co-commercialize Aimovig in the United States. However, Amgen retains commercialization rights in Japan while Novartis has rights in Europe, Canada and the Rest of World.Importantly, the candidate is under review in the United States for the same indication with a response expected in May 17, 2018. Notably, the candidate is the first investigational therapy targeting the CGRP pathway to having received a regulatory filing acceptance from the FDA for the given indication.Per the company, around 10 million people in the United States are affected by migraine. Among them, approximately 3.5 million are on a preventive therapy with 80% likely to discontinue the treatment within a year. Thus, approval of the drug will address the hugely unmet need of patients suffering the disease in the country.However, several companies, namely Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA  -  Free Report) and Eli Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) among others are developing migraine treatments targeting CGRP.Amgen Inc.

1033,LLY,"The first-quarter earnings season has just kicked off. Per the latest Earnings Preview, the bottom line of S&P 500 companies is expected to increase at a highly impressive rate of 16.6% on a year-over-year basis. This prospective upside marks the maximum quarterly earnings growth pace in seven years. The report further predicts that 11 of the 16 Zacks sectors are projected to exhibit double-digit earnings growth in the to-be-reported quarter. Total revenues for the same set of companies are projected to grow 7.5%.However, focusing our attention on the Large Cap Pharma and Medical-Drugs sector, we note that both these sectors have decreased 6.2% and 4.2%, respectively, since February this year due to broader market pressure. Further, the S&P 500 index has registered a decline of 6.2% since the second month of 2018.We remind investors that the U.S. stock market is facing a severe volatility since the last couple of months despite a strong start this year. This downside can mainly be attributable to a potentially damaging trade war between the world’s two largest economies, United States and China, since this February.After President Donald Trump announced plans to impose tariffs on up to $60 billion of annual Chinese imports, China retaliated by notifying its intention to levy tariffs on 128 U.S. products. Such aggressive exchange has triggered tensions of a possible trade dispute between the two countries. Moreover, sluggish large-cap tech stocks are cited as another reason for this plummet in the market.Despite the recent market unrest, an optimistic sentiment revolves around the remaining year. Notably, the biotech sector is likely to improve as the year advances. We expect new product sales to thrive in tandem with rising demand. This apart, a successful innovation and a host of product launches, strong clinical study outcomes, more frequent FDA nods, solid performance of key products, growing demand for drugs, especially to deal with rare-to-treat diseases, an ageing population and an escalated healthcare expenditure are some of the factors to keep the sector stable. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.It is important to note that the outlook for the upcoming first-quarter results looks bright. Per the Earnings Preview, the broader Medical sector (inclusive of drug, biotech as well as Medical Device companies) is expected to record 6.3% year-over-year growth in revenues and a 7.8% rise in earnings.How to Pick Potential Q1 WinnersGiven the enormity of the healthcare space, the task of selecting stocks with possibilities to beat estimates could appear quite daunting. But the Zacks proprietary methodology makes this job fairly simple. One way to carve out the top choices this reporting cycle is by looking at the stocks with the combination of a favorable Zacks Rank — Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — and a positive Earnings ESP. It is observed that a positive earnings surprise delivered by a company mostly leads to its stock price appreciation.Per the well-researched quantitative model, an Earnings ESP is used for identifying stocks with higher or 70% chances of pulling off a positive surprise in the impending earnings announcement. It shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Per our proven methodology, we culled three stocks from large-cap pharma and two from the medical-drug sector, poised to surpass estimates in the to-be-reported quarter.The three large cap stocks are as follows:Our first pick is AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report). This North Chicago, IL-based company has an Earnings ESP of +0.24% and a Zacks Rank #3.

The consensus mark for first-quarter bottom line is pegged at 73 cents per share. Pfizer is scheduled to release financial figures on May 1.Given below are the two medical-drug stocks:Our first pick from the medical-drug sector is Catalent, Inc. (CTLT  -  Free Report).

1034,LLY,"Roche Holding AG’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) subsidiary Genentech announced that a phase III study, evaluating a combination of its PD-L1 inhibitor Tecentriqplus chemotherapy (carboplatin and Abraxane) for first line treatment of advanced lung cancer met its co-primary endpoint of progression-free survival (“PFS”). The IMpower131 study showed that the combination reduced the risk of disease worsening or death (PFS) compared with chemotherapy alone in the initial treatment of patients with advanced squamous non-small cell lung cancer (“NSCLC”).However, the above results did not show a statistically significant overall survival (“OS”) benefit. Hence the study will be continued. and the interim data will be presented at an upcoming oncology congress.Over a year, shares of Roche have declined 8.2% against the industry’s growth of 8.1%. Tecentriq is marketed for the treatment of second-line metastatic NSCLC. Label expansion in the first line setting should boost the drug’s sales further. Tecentriq is also approved for the treatment of patients suffering from locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC) who are not eligible for cisplatin chemotherapy. The drug recored sales of CHF457 million in 2017.In February 2018, Roche announced positive results from the phase III IMmotion151 study on Tecentriq in combination with oncology drug Avastin (bevacizumab) as a first line treatment for advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma. The study met its co-primary endpoint of investigator-assessed PFS in patients whose disease expressed the PD-L1 protein. Results showed that patients who received Tecentriq plus Avastin had a 26% reduced risk of disease worsening or death (PFS) compared to people treated with Sutent.We remind investors that Merck’s  (MRK  -  Free Report) PD-L1 inhibitor Keytruda is approved by the FDA  both as monotherapy and in combination with Lilly’s  (LLY  -  Free Report) Alimta and carboplatin for the first line treatment of patients with metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC.Roche Holding AG Price Roche Holding AG Price | Roche Holding AG Quote Zacks Rank & Another Stock to ConsiderRoche carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Another top-ranked stock from the same space is Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN  -  Free Report),sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Regeneron’s earnings per share estimates have moved up from $18.65 to $18.68 for 2018 in the last 30 days. The company pulled off a positive earnings surprise in three of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 9.15%.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2%, respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

1035,LLY,"Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) shares increased 2.59% on Apr 16 after it presented full data from the pivotal phase III KEYNOTE-189 study. Data from the same showed that Keytruda combined with Eli Lilly’s (LLY  -  Free Report) Alimta (pemetrexed) and platinum chemotherapy (cisplatin or carboplatin) significantly improved overall survival, thereby reducing the death risk by half (51%) compared with chemotherapy alone.The study evaluated the combination therapy for first-line treatment of patients with metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) regardless of PD-L1 expression. The combo treatment showed progress in overall survival irrespective of PD-L1 expression including patients with tumors testing negative for PD-L1.Meanwhile, a significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) was observed with decrease in death risk by 48% in the Keytruda combination arm compared with the chemotherapy arm. The median PFS was 8.8 months in the Keytruda arm compared with 4.9 months in the chemotherapy one. A PFS improvement was also observed in patients, whose tumors tested negative for PD-L1.The results were presented at the annual meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research.Notably in January this year, Merck had announced that the study met both its primary endpoints, PFS and OS as well.Importantly, Keytruda is the first PD1 inhibitor in combination to show OS in patients with NSCLC.Last May, this combination therapy was granted an accelerated approval by the FDA for the aforementioned indication. The nod was based on tumor response rate and PFS data from the KEYNOTE-021 trial. Hence, the positive readouts from the KEYNOTE-189 confirmatory study will help the company gain a continued approval for the combo therapy, which should in turn support uptake and sales.We remind investors that in the third quarter of 2017, Merck had mentioned that it is including the overall survival (OS) as a co-primary endpoint in the KEYNOTE-189 program, which could defer the readout from the study to 2019. It was then estimated that the evaluation would be completed by February 2019. However, the company released data from KEYNOTE-189 study a year earlier than expected in January 2018.Merck’s shares have gained 6.2% so far this year versus the 2.7% decline of its industry. Concurrently, Bristol-Myers (BMY  -  Free Report) also reported data from a phase III study on its blockbuster drug Opdivo for NSCLC. However, Merck’s Keytruda combination demonstrated better overall survival compared with Opdivo.Zacks Rank & Key PickMerck carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A better-ranked stock in the health care sector is Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (LGND  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

1036,LLY,"Biogen Inc.’s (BIIB  -  Free Report) shares were up around 7% in after-market trading on Thursday on positive top-line data from a mid-stage study evaluating its pipeline candidate, BAN2401 for the treatment of early Alzheimer’s disease (AD).Biogen is developing BAN2401, a humanized beta amyloid antibody, in collaboration with Japan’s Eisai Co., Ltd. Amyloid is a protein that forms plaques in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s. The candidate is being investigated to see whether it can slow the progression of memory problems associated with amyloid.Top-line results of the final analysis of the phase II study (n=856) demonstrated statistically significant slowing of disease progression on the key clinical endpoint (ADCOMS) after 18 months of treatment in patients receiving the highest treatment dose (10 mg/kg biweekly) of BAN2401 as compared to placebo. Meanwhile, treatment with this high dose for 18 months also led to reduction of amyloid beta accumulated in the brain. The study included five dose regimens.This data marked an important breakthrough by Biogen and Eisai in the challenging AD market which led to the share price increase. However, so far this year, Biogen’s shares have declined 6.2%, almost inline with the industry’s decline of 6.5% in the same time frame.   In late 2017, data announced from the same study failed to show early positive results, which raised investors’ concerns about the candidate’s chances of success. An Independent Data Monitoring Committee said that BAN2401 did not meet the criteria for success based on a Bayesian analysis at 12 months as the primary endpoint. With the study failing to show an early positive result, the company said that the blinded study, which is being conducted in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD or mild Alzheimer's dementia (collectively known as early Alzheimer’s disease) will continue with a comprehensive final analysis to be conducted at 18 months.Detailed data from the study is expected to be presented at future conferences.Alzheimer’s, a fatal illness that causes progressive decline in memory, has always been a highly challenging area with not much progress being made in spite of significant investments (both funds and resources).Several companies have failed to develop safe and effective treatment options for this deadly brain disease.Last month, Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) and its Swiss partner AstraZeneca (AZN  -  Free Report) discontinued two late-stage studies on their Alzheimer’s disease candidate, lanabecestat, on recommendation of the IDMC. The IDMC said that the two studies were unlikely to meet their primary goals upon completion. Back in November 2016, Lilly said that it would not seek approval for its investigational AD treatment, solanezumab, following disappointing results from a late-stage study.In May this year, J&J (JNJ  -  Free Report) halted development of atabecestat, its investigational BACE inhibitor, which was being developed for preclinical stage AD due to safety concerns.In February this year, Merck discontinued the second late-stage study evaluating its BACE inhibitor verubecestat for the treatment of prodromal AD as its success was unlikely. In February last year, Merck discontinued a late-stage study evaluating verubecestat for mild-to-moderate AD due to lack of efficacy.In January, Pfizer said it will end R&D efforts in the Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease areas. Long back, Pfizer had shelved its late-stage AD candidate, bapineuzumab IV after it failed two phase III studies.Despite the setbacks, several companies continue to invest heavily in developing Alzheimer’s disease treatments, given the high commercial potential in this market. Success in this area means huge returns, considering that more than five million Americans are living with Alzheimer’s disease with the numbers expected to triple by 2050 (Data: Alzheimer's Association). It is considered to be one of the biggest burdens of society and is the sixth leading cause of death across all ages in the United States. The market has immense commercial potential and companies coming out with new treatments could rake in billions of dollars in sales.Biogen currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1037,LLY,"Merck and Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) gained priority review for yet another supplemental biologics license application (sBLA) for its PD-1 inhibitor, Keytruda. With the latest application, Merck is looking to get Keytruda approved in combination with chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of metastatic squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which is a difficult-to-treat lung cancer patient population. The FDA granted priority review to this sBLA with a decision scheduled on Oct 30.The sBLA filing was based on data from the KEYNOTE-407 study. At the recently concluded annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, data presentation from this pivotal lung cancer study resulted in Merck emerging as a winner at this annual key cancer event. Data from the study showed that the combination of Keytruda plus chemotherapy led to significant improvement in both overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival regardless of PD-L1 expression. PD-L1 is a protein present on the surface of cells.The risk of death (OS) was reduced by 36% compared to chemotherapy alone. The PFS improvement or as we say reduction in the risk of progression or death was nearly half for patients in the Keytruda combination group compared with chemotherapy alone.The data was termed “practice changing” by CNBC – changing the way doctors look at prescribing these drugs to cancer patients. It further cemented Merck’s position in the lung cancer market, which is the most lucrative oncology sector.This year so far, Merck’s shares have risen 7.4% against the industry’s decline of 5.1%.In a short span of time, Keytruda has become Merck’s largest product. It is already approved for use in 10 different settings involving seven different tumor types. This year, it has already gained approval for two new indications. These include third-line treatment of adult as well as pediatric patients with primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL), a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and second-line treatment of recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer. These label expansion approvals should drive sales of Keytruda in the future quarters.The treatment generated sales of $1.5 billion in first-quarter 2018, up 12.9% sequentially and 151% year over year. This upside was driven by the global launch for new indications, which further boosted demand.  Keytruda sales are gaining, particularly from strong momentum in the first-line lung cancer indication. In fact, Keytruda is the only anti-PD-1 approved in the first-line setting for certain lung cancer patients both as a monotherapy as well as a combination therapy with Eli Lilly’s (LLY  -  Free Report) cancer drug, Alimta (pemetrexed) and carboplatin (pem/carbo).Keytruda is also being studied for more than 30 types of cancer in more than 700 studies, including in excess of 400 combination studies. Merck is collaborating with several companies including Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report), Incyte (INCY  -  Free Report), Glaxo and Pfizer separately for the evaluation of Keytruda in combination with other regimens.Merck has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1038,LLY,"Pharma giant Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) announced positive top-line results from a second phase III study on its arthritis drug, Taltz (ixekizumab), for the treatment of Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS), also known as radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (r-axSpA).The phase III study, COAST-W, evaluated the safety and efficacy of Taltz for the treatment of AS. This is the first AS trial on a patient population with inadequate response to one or two tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors or intolerance to a TNF inhibitor.The results showed that Taltz demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in the signs and symptoms of AS, measured by the proportion of patients having achieved Assessment of Spondyloarthritis International Society 40 (ASAS40) response at 16 weeks when compared with placebo. The study met the primary and major secondary endpoints.AS is a type of spondyloarthritis affecting the pelvic joints and spine.Notably, the company had earlier reported positive results from the phase III COAST-V study on Taltz for the therapy of AS.Lilly plans to submit detailed data from the COAST-W study at scientific meetings and in peer-reviewed journals later in 2018. Based on the positive results from the COAST-V and COAST-W studies, the company plans to submit the same for approval in the United States later this year.We like to remind investors that apart from psoriatic arthritis, Taltz is approved for treating moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in adults, eligible for systemic therapy or phototherapy, as well as for active psoriatic arthritis. Although many other drugs like Novartis’ (NVS  -  Free Report) Cosentyx and AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Humira are approved to treat plaque psoriasis, Lilly claims Taltz is now the first and the only FDA approved treatment for genital psoriasis.Taltz logged sales of $146.5 million in the first quarter. The label expansion will in turn, expand the eligible patient population of the drug, driving sales going forward. The drug recorded sales of $559.2 million in 2017.Shares of Lilly have inched up 1.3% year to date against the industry’s decline of 6.1%. Lilly currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The study evaluated the efficacy and safety of 14 mg oral Ozempic compared with 25 mg Eli Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) and Boehringer Ingelheim’s Jardiance (empagliflozin) with type II diabetes inadequately controlled on metformin.The 52 week study achieved its primary objective and demonstrated a statistically significant and superior improvement in blood glucose levels (HbA1c) with oral Ozempic compared to Jardiance at 26 weeks. The study showed a statistically significant improvement in HbA1c of 1.4% at 26 weeks and 1.3% at 52 weeks, compared to an improvement in HbA1c of 0.9% and 0.8% with 25 mg empagliflozin at 26 and 52 weeks, respectivelyOzempic also demonstrated weight loss of 4.2 kg at 26 weeks and 4.7 kg at 52 weeks versus 3.8 kg with 25 mg Jardiance at both 26 weeks and 52 weeks.  The increased weight loss with oral Ozempic was also significant compared to Jardiance at the 52-week time point.We remind investors that in December 2017, the FDA approved Ozempic once-daily pre-filled pen to improve glycaemic control in type II diabetes patients. It is also approved in Europe, Japan and Canda for the same indication.Shares of Novo Nordisk have decreased 12.8% compared with the industry’s decline of 6%.In February 2018, Novo Nordisk successfully completed the first phase IIIa trial, PIONEER 1, with oral Ozempic for treatment of adults with type II diabetes.

1040,LLY,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Lilly has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 18.4, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 21.3. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Lilly’s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years. Moreover, the current level is fairly below the highs for this stock, suggesting it might be a good entry point.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the sector’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 20.2. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Lilly has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 16.2, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Lilly stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Lilly has a P/S ratio of about 3.6. This is marginally higher than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.4 right now. Nonetheless, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.Also, LLY is toward the lower end of its range in the time period from a P/S metric, suggesting some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Lilly currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Lilly a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for Lilly is just 1.5, a level that is lower than the industry average of 2.1. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate.What About the Stock Overall?Though Lilly might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of A and a Momentum score of B. This gives LLY a Zacks VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been mostly trending higher. The current quarter has seen no estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to one lower, while the full year estimate has seen nine upward and one downward revisions in the same time period.As a result, the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 5.6% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has increased 3.6%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Eli Lilly and Company Price and Consensus  Eli Lilly and Company Price and Consensus | Eli Lilly and Company QuoteEven though Lilly has a better estimates trend, the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). That is why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineLilly is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Furthermore, a robust industry rank (among the Top 18%) should boost investor confidence.However over the past two years, the industry has underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:Despite the poor past performance of the industry, a good industry rank signals that the stock is likely to benefit from favorable broader factors in the immediate future. Add to this the positive estimate revisions and robust value metrics, and we believe that we have a strong value contender in Lilly.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

1042,LLY,"Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) announced that its smoking cessation drug, Chantix (varenicline) failed in a phase IV study, evaluating it in adolescent smokers. The study was being conducted as a regulatory post marketing commitment in smokers aged 12 to 16 years in the United States and 12 to 17 years in Europe.The complete study results are expected to be presented at an upcoming scientific congress and will be published later in a peer-reviewed medical journal.Chantix is already on the market as a prescription drug for helping adults aged 18 and over, along with counseling, to stop smoking.Shares of the company were down 3.1% on Mar 23. Meanwhile, Pfizer’s shares have declined 4.8% so far this year, compared with the industry’s decline of 5.8% in that period.The dose ranging multi-centre phase IV study evaluated Chantix for smoking cessation in nicotine dependent adolescents in combination with age-appropriate counselling. The study evaluated two dosages of the drug – 0.5 mg once and twice daily.Chantix failed to meet the primary endpoint of the four-week continuous abstinence rate compared to placebo at weeks 9 through 12.The adverse events observed in the study were similar to those seen in an earlier study conducted in adult smokers.Pfizer is planning to submit data from this study to the FDA for pediatric exclusivity determination. Pediatric exclusivity is granted for six months in return for conducting studies in pediatric patients. With the failure of the study on young smokers, it is unlikely to receive the exclusivity.In another setback for Pfizer, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK  -  Free Report) terminated talks to buy the former’s consumer healthcare business.

1043,LLY,"Shares of Radius Health (RDUS  -  Free Report) fell 4% after the company suffered a setback once again in Europe.Overall, Radius Health’s shares have lost 7% in the last six months as against the industry’s  gain of 3.2%.  The scientific committee of the European Commission, Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”), rendered a negative trend vote on the benefit-risk balance for the marketing authorization application (“MAA”) for abaloparatide-SC in an oral explanation. The CHMP will therefore adopt a negative opinion on the same. The company was planning to get abaloparatide-SC approved for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at increased risk for fracture.Radius Health plans to seek a re-examination of the CHMP opinion.In December 2017, the CHMP issued a third Day-180 List of Outstanding Issues and informed the company that it intends to refer the MAA to a scientific advisory group for additional advice. The company has earlier issued a second Day-180 List of Outstanding Issues. The delay in getting approval in Europe is disappointing given the market potential.We note that abaloparatide injection was approved by the FDA in April 2017 under the brand name Tymlos for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture, multiple risk factors for fracture, or patients who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapy.Tymlos continues to gain traction with approximately 259 million covered lives and 93% coverage in commercial plans. Tymlos market share reached approximately 32% of new patients starting anabolic therapy (NBRx) and 13% of total prescriptions in the anabolic market.Although the osteoporosis market in the United Sates has great potential as approximately 1.4 million postmenopausal women experience an osteoporotic fractur each year, Tymlos is expected to face significant competition from Eli Lilly & Co's (LLY  -  Free Report) Forteo and Amgen's (AMGN  -  Free Report) Prolia.Radius Health’s pipeline includes an abaloparatide patch for potential use in osteoporosis; elacestrant (RAD1901) for the treatment of hormone-receptor positive breast cancer and RAD140, a non-steroidal, selective androgen receptor modulator which is being evaluated for use in hormone-receptor positive breast cancer.Zacks Rank & Key PickRadius Health currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the health care sector is Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN  -  Free Report) which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

1045,LLY,"Radius Health, Inc. (RDUS  -  Free Report) reported a loss of $1.37 per share in the first quarter of 2018, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $1.43 but wider than the year-ago period loss of $1.32. Increase in general and administrative expenses led to the wider than anticipated net loss year over year.The company reported sales of Tymlos (abaloparatide) of $14.5 million surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.8 million.Quarter in DetailTymlos sales of $14.5 million increased 90% from the fourth quarter of 2017. Radius Health received the FDA approval for Tymlos in April 2017 for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk of fracture. The company began shipments of the drug to wholesalers at the end of May 2017.Tymlos continues to gain traction with approximately 263 million covered lives and 88% coverage in commercial plans. Tymlos market share reached approximately 31% of new anabolic patients starting anabolic therapy (NBRx) and 13% of total U.S. anabolic osteoporosis market (based on Patient Months on Therapy, TRx PMOT) in the first quarter of 2018.Research and development expenses for the reported quarter were $22.9 million, up 17% year over year.General and administrative expenses for the reported quarter increased 26% to $48 million due to increase incompensation, travel related expenses and increase in selling,  general and administrative expenses.Pipeline UpdatesThe company is developing two formulations of abaloparatide-SC and abaloparatide-transdermal. Radius Health suffered a setback when the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) adopted a negative opinion on the Radius Health’s marketing authorization application for abaloparatide-SC in March 2018. Consequently, in April 2018, Radius Health submitted a request for re-examination of the CHMP’s opinion.Radius Health initiated the phase III study, ATOM (Abaloparatide Treatment for Osteoporosis in Males) on abaloparatide-SC for the treatment of osteoporosis in men, which, if successful, will form the basis of a supplemental NDA seeking to expand the drug’s label.  The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial will enroll approximately 225 men with osteoporosis at high risk of fracture.  The study will include a primary endpoint of change in lumbar spine bone mineral density at 12 months versus placebo, and specialized high-resolution imaging of bone structure in a subset of the study participants.  Per estimates, male osteoporosis is estimated to account for approximately 10% of the total treated osteoporotic patient population.During the quarter, Radius Health finalized a development pathway for abaloparatide-patch after regulatory alignment with the FDA and entered into a scale-up and commercial supply agreement with 3M Company.Meanwhile, Radius Health will conduct a single, randomized, comparator controlled phase III trial of elacestrant as a third-line monotherapy in approximately 300 patients with ER positive/HER2 negative advanced/metastatic breast cancer as per the feedback from the FDA and EMA.  The results are expected to support applications for global marketing approvals if positive. Patients in the study would be randomized to receive either elacestrant or an investigator’s choice of an approved hormonal agent. The primary endpoint of the study will be progression-free survival. The study is planned to be initiated in the second half of 2018.A phase I study evaluating the safety and maximum tolerated dose of RAD140 in patients with hormone receptor-positive, locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer is currently enrolling. Radius Health expects to provide an update on the RAD140 development program by the end of 2018.Our TakeThe company’s narrower-than-expected loss in the first quarter was encouraging as sales of Tymlos are picking up. Radius Health saw a 103% increase in the total number of U.S. physicians prescribing Tymlos in the first quarter of 2018 as compared to the fourth quarter. Tymlos’ share of new prescriptions by these physicians increased from 32% in the fourth quarter of 2017 to 49% in the first quarter of 2018. The price of the drug was increased by 5.9%, implemented on Feb 22, 2018.Going forward, Radius Health expects Tymlos to capture on average 19-21% of the U.S. anabolic osteoporosis market in 2018, while anabolic market in the United States is expected to increase by 5-7% in volume.Radius Health’ shares have rallied 14.7% in the last six months compared with the industry’s  gain of 7.0%.  Although the osteoporosis market in the United Sates has great potential as approximately 1.4 million postmenopausal women experience an osteoporotic fracture each year, Tymlos is expected to face significant competition from Eli Lilly &Co's (LLY  -  Free Report) Forteo and Amgen's (AMGN  -  Free Report) Prolia.Zacks Rank & Stock to ConsiderRadius Health currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A better-ranked stock in the healthcare sector is Exelixis (EXEL  -  Free Report) which currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Exelixis’ earnings per share estimates increased from 54 cents to 86 cents for 2018 over the past 30 days.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

The company has reported wider-than-expected loss in the trailing four trailing quarters with an average negative earnings surprise of 8.93%.In the last reported quarter, increase in general and administrative expenses led to the wider than anticipated net loss year over year.Radius Health’s shares have lost 11.1% over a year as against the industry’s 3.1% gain.   Let’s see how things are shaping up for the quarter under review.Factors at PlayRadius Health develops therapeutics for the treatment of osteoporosis, oncology and endocrine diseases.The company’s lead drug, Tymlos, was approved in the United States in April 2017. The drug was approved for treating postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture, defined as history of osteoporotic fracture and multiple risk factors for fracture. The drug can also be used for patients who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapies.The company reported sales of Tymlos (abaloparatide) of $7.7 million in fourth-quarter 2017.Hence, we expect investors to focus on the uptake of the drug during the upcoming earnings call.Although the osteoporosis market in the United States has great potential as approximately 1.4 million postmenopausal women suffer from osteoporotic fractures each year, Tymlos is expected to face significant competition from Eli Lilly &Co's LLY  Forteo and Amgen’s AMGN  Prolia.Meanwhile, the company’s Marketing Authorisation Application for Eladynos (abaloparatide-SC) in Europe for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis was under review.  However, the scientific committee of the European Commission, Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”), gave a negative trend vote on the benefit-risk balance for the marketing authorization application (“MAA”) for abaloparatide-SC in an oral explanation. The CHMP will therefore adopt a negative opinion on the same. The company was planning to get abaloparatide-SC approved for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at increased risk for fracture. Radius Health plans to seek a re-examination of the CHMP opinion.In December 2017, the CHMP issued a third Day-180 List of Outstanding Issues and informed the company that it intends to refer the MAA to a scientific advisory group for additional advice. The company has earlier issued a second Day-180 List of Outstanding Issues. The delay in getting approval in Europe is disappointing given the market potential.Meanwhile, the company presented positive data on elacestrant for breast cancer in December 2017. The FDA also granted Fast Track designation to elacestrant in October 2017.  In February 2018, Radius Health obtained scientific advice from the EMA regarding a potential single-arm monotherapy phase II trial of elacestrant in patients with ER-positive/HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Based on feedback from the EMA and the FDA, the company will conduct a single, randomized, controlled phase II trial of elacestrant as a third-line monotherapy in approximately 300 patients with ER positive/HER2 negative advanced/metastatic breast cancer. Hence, we expect the management to throw more light on pipeline progress.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not show that Radius Health is likely to beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for Radius Health is currently pegged at +2.42%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at a loss of $1.37 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at a loss of $1.40.

1048,LLY,"The biotech sector witnessed a series of events over the past week. Quite a few companies reported quarterly results over the week alongside announcing pipeline updates. Over the past week while Amgen revised its annual guidance, Biogen reported quarterly numbers wherein sales missed estimates.Recap of Important Stories:Prothena Plunges on Discontinuation of Study: Shares of Prothena Corp. (PRTA  -  Free Report) plunged as the company decided to discontinue the development of its lead pipeline candidate, NEOD001. The candidate, an antibody, was being evaluated for the treatment of AL amyloidosis. A phase IIb study, PRONTO, did not meet its primary or secondary endpoints. Hence, the company asked the independent data monitoring committee (“DMC”) of the phase III VITAL study to review a futility analysis of the ongoing VITAL study. Thereafter, the DMC recommended discontinuation of the VITAL study for futility.Hence, the company decided to discontinue all studies for the development of NEOD001, including the VITAL study as well as the open label extension studies. The decision came as a major blow to the investors as the company has a very limited number of candidates in its pipeline and NEOD001 was a lead candidate.Prothena carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Incyte/Lilly’s Drug Gets FDA Advisory Committee Nod: Incyte Corp.

The FDA had earlier issued a Complete Response Letter for the same. The drug is approved as Olumiant in Europe.Amgen Revises Annual Guidance: Amgen, Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) revised 2018 guidance concurrent with its first-quarter results.

1049,LLY,"On Monday, President Trump stepped up the rhetoric on pharma companies, saying that his administration would soon take action to bring down drug prices. This is in keeping with promises he made on the campaign trail as well as comments made last year and during his State of the Union address.Meanwhile, industry watchers have grown skeptical about Trump’s intermittent pronouncements on this issue. Also, key government databases which reveal the quantum of funds spent on healthcare have not been updated recently, raising questions on the administration’s seriousness about taking action.Given this backdrop, it makes good sense to invest in select biotech stocks, especially those of small companies focusing on developing cutting edge treatment.Drug Price Cuts around the Corner?On Monday, Trump delivered a speech on the federal government’s initiatives to fight the country’s opioid addiction crisis at Manchester, New Hampshire. During his speech, Trump launched into pharma companies, raising the issue of exorbitant drug pricing once again.Trump said that consumers in the United States were paying more for drugs than many other countries across the world and his administration would work toward changing that situation. The President said that citizens of the United States would witness “drug prices falling very substantially” but characteristically avoided mentioning any specifics.Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar also pitched in during the event to reveal that an entire raft of proposals would be introduced to reduce the price of prescription drugs. Azar too refrained from mentioning concrete plans, choosing only to praise UnitedHealth Group Incorporated’s (UNH  -  Free Report) decision to pass on discounts obtained from pharma companies to customers.Skepticism on Concrete Action AboundsApart from the comments made on the election trail, Trump has called for strong action on drug prices intermittently. In November last year, when Trump appointed Azar to his current position, he claimed that the former chief of the U.S. arm of Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) would be “a star for better healthcare and lower drug prices.” Trump even chose to take up the issue during his State of the Union Address saying drug prices would come down during his tenure.But little action has followed all this tough talk. A much discussed executive order on drug pricing has failed to materialize despite the fact that pharma companies have raised prices of several drugs during Trump’s tenure. Trump met leading pharma officials before completing his first month as President and even had them seated at this table at the World Economic Forum in Davos.Further, Trump has hired several former pharma industry employees for his administration, including Azar, during whose tenure prices of several drugs increased more than 100%. Meanwhile the Department of Health and Human Services has failed to update databases which reveal the quantum of government funds spent on healthcare, including the costs of drugs.This is proving to be advantageous for pharma companies since they can now avoid revealing details on drug pricing. This in turn affects efforts by researchers and non-profit groups who work toward lowering the prices of key drugs.Our ChoicesIndustry watchers feel that pharma investors have gotten used to Trump’s rhetoric on drug prices and largely choose to ignore any such comments. Meanwhile, Trump has inducted several former pharma industry employees into his administration, appointing some to key positions.This is why the outlook for pharma companies, especially those from the biotech industry focusing on unique treatments, remains undimmed. Investing in select biotech stocks looks like a good option at this point. We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and other relevant metrics.Biohaven Pharmaceutical Holding Company Ltd. (BHVN  -  Free Report) is a biopharmaceutical company which focuses on the identification and development of orphan neurologic indications and other neurological pathways.Biohaven Pharmaceutical has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

1050,LLY,"Radius Health, Inc. (RDUS  -  Free Report) announced positive results from the phase III study, ACTIVExtend, at ENDO 2018, the Endocrine Society's 100th Annual Meeting and Expo in Chicago.The phase III study, ACTIVE (Abaloparatide Comparator Trial In Vertebral Endpoints) trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, comparative, multicenter, 18-month international study in 2,463 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. The study evaluated the efficacy and safety of abaloparatide-SC 80 mcg to reduce the risk of vertebral and nonvertebral fractures.  ACTIVExtend is an extension of the ACTIVE trial. The trial enrolled patients who completed 18 months of abaloparatide-SC or placebo in ACTIVE to receive up to 24 additional months of open-label alendronate.Patients who completed 18 months of Tymlos injection or placebo in the ACTIVE trial were transitioned to receive 24 additional months of open-label alendronate, a bisphosphonate.Bone Mineral Density (“BMD”) was measured at the lumbar spine, total hip, and femoral neck from the beginning of ACTIVE to the end of ACTIVExtend. Results showed that BMD response rates increased in both the abaloparatide followed by alendronate group and the placebo followed by alendronate group from ACTIVE baseline through the 43 months of ACTIVExtend. Additionally, greater BMD response rates of more than 0%, 3% and 6% were noted in the abaloparatide followed by alendronate group versus the placebo followed by alendronate group at all three sites combined at 43 months. At each anatomic site, BMD increases of more than 3% and 6% were noted respectively at each visit and at 43 months.60.7% of abaloparatide followed by alendronate patients experienced BMD increases of more than 3 % at all three sites as compared with 24% of patients who received placebo followed by alendronate. The results from the ACTIVExtend Responder Analysis are consistent with the significant BMD response with Tymlos versus placebo observed in ACTIVE trial.We remind investors that in April 2017, the FDA approved Tymlos (abaloparatide -SC) for the treatment of postmenopausal women with high risk osteoporosis for fracture — defined as history of osteoporotic fracture — multiple risk factors for fracture, or patients who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapy.  Radius Health’s shares have moved up 3.9% in the last six months compared with the industry’s  gain of 6.8%.Tymlos continues to gain traction with approximately 259 million covered lives and 93% coverage in commercial plans. Tymlos market share reached approximately 32% of new patients starting anabolic therapy (NBRx) and 13% of total prescriptions in the anabolic market.Although the osteoporosis market in the United Sates has great potential as approximately 1.4 million postmenopausal women experience an osteoporotic fractur each year, Tymlos is expected to face significant competition from Eli Lilly & Co's (LLY  -  Free Report) Forteo and Amgen's (AMGN  -  Free Report) Prolia. The company also suffered a setback when the CHMP issued a third Day-180 List of Outstanding Issues.Zacks Rank & Key PickRadius Health currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the health care sector is Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN  -  Free Report) which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

1051,LLY,"Celldex Therapeutics, Inc. (CLDX  -  Free Report) has incurred fourth-quarter 2017 loss (excluding income tax benefit of $19.1 million) of 17 cents per share, narrower than both the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 23 cents as well as the year-ago loss of 30 cents. Lower costs and higher revenues led to this upside.Total revenues in the quarter soared 84.4% year over year to $3.5 million, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.91 million. The manufacturing service agreement with the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative drove the top line.Shares of the company rose 2% in after-hours trading on Mar 7.However, the stock has not done too well in the past year. Shares of the company have underperformed its industry, having declined 28.4% compared with the industry’s 3.9% decrease. Quarterly DetailsResearch and development expenses declined 4.5% from the year-ago period to $23.5 million.

The biotech company’s weakened cash position was due to higher operating expense, partially offset by net proceeds raised from sales of its common stock this month under the contract with Cantor.2017 ResultsTotal revenues for the year surged 87.8% to $12.7 million, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10.57 million.Net loss for 2017 (excluding income tax benefit of $24.3 million) came in at 91 cents per share, slightly wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 90 cents. However, the company had reported $1.27 of loss a year ago.2018 OutlookCelldex expects that its cash position as of December 2017-end plus $6.1 million in net proceeds generated from the sale of its common stock in the last two months and the anticipated proceeds from any future sales of common stock under the agreement with Cantor will be adequate to fund the working capital requirements as well as the planned operations through 2018.Pipeline UpdateCelldex’s most advanced pipeline candidate is antibody drug conjugate, glembatumumab vedotin, currently under evaluation for the treatment of triple negative breast cancer (phase IIb METRIC study) and metastatic melanoma (phase II). Enrolment in the key METRIC study was completed in August 2017 with top-line data expected in the second quarter of 2018. The company also plans to file a biologics license application in the second half of 2019.In the melanoma study, Celldex added a fourth cohort, a glembatumumab plus CDX-301 arm. The combination will be studied on patients with failed prior checkpoint therapy.Apart from glembatumumab vedotin, promising candidates in the company’s pipeline include varlilumab, CDX-3379 and CDX-014.In January 2018, the company closed enrollment for phase II trial, evaluating varlilumab with Bristol-Myers’ (BMY  -  Free Report) Opdivo including cohorts in five indications namely colorectal cancer, ovarian cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma and glioblastoma.Celldex expanded its phase I study in January, assessing CDX-014 in advanced renal cell carcinoma to include patients with ovarian clear cell carcinoma.In November 2017, the company initiated a phase II program on CDX-3379 in combination with Eli Lilly’s (LLY  -  Free Report) Erbitux in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, having developed resistance to Erbitux.The company also commenced a phase I study in the same month to evaluate CDX-014 for treating locally advanced or metastatic solid tumorsCelldex Therapeutics, Inc.

1052,LLY,"Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) and Boehringer Ingelheim announced plans to expand the clinical program for their SGLT2 inhibitor Jardiance (empagliflozin) in chronic heart failure through the EMPERIAL clinical trials. Lilly’s shares have lost 7.1% over a year against the industry’s upside of 8.4%.  The EMPERIAL clinical trials, comprising two phase III studies, are aimed at assessing possible benefits of Lilly’s type II diabetes drug Jardiance on improving exercise capacity and heart failure symptoms in people with chronic heart failure irrespective of whether they have type II diabetesWe remind investors that in late 2016, FDA approved a new indication for the drug to lower the risk of cardiovascular death in adults with type II diabetes. The approval was based on data from the EMPA-REG OUTCOME study. With the inclusion of the cardiovascular indication in Jardiance’s label in 2017, there has been a surge in sales of the drug. The EMPERIAL clinical studies are based on data obtained from the EMPA-REG OUTCOME study effect of Jardiance on heart failure outcomes.Meanwhile, Jardiance is already being evaluated two phase III EMPEROR studies (outcomes studies) of Jardiance for the treatment of chronic heart failure in patients with and without diabetes.Though the EMPEROR studies focus on long-term morbidity and mortality outcomes in people with heart failure, the EMPERIAL studies will investigate if treatment with Jardiance can help improve the everyday lives of people with chronic heart failureAccording to the company’s press release, heart failure is a serious condition and it affects 26 million people worldwide, including more than 6 million Americans, and is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Both Lilly and Boehringer are looking for ways to see how Jardiance can improve patient health outcomes.Jardiance sales rose 122% to $447.5 million in 2017, driven by increased market share within the growing SGLT2 class in the United States and increased volume outside the United States. Eli Lilly and Company Price  Eli Lilly and Company Price | Eli Lilly and Company Quote Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderLilly carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks from the same space are Regeneron (REGN  -  Free Report), Ligand Pharmaceuticals (LGND  -  Free Report)and Enanta Pharma (ENTA  -  Free Report).

1053,LLY,"Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) announced data from the phase II KEYNOTE-224 study evaluating the use of its anti-PD-1 therapy, Keytruda in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)-a form of liver cancer, who were previously treated with systemic therapy (sorafenib). The data showed that treatment with Keytruda monotherapy led to an overall response rate (ORR) of 16.3%. The data also showed complete response rate of 1% and a partial response rate of 15.4% on treatment with KeytrudaThe data also included six-month overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) rates. The median PFS in the Keytruda arm was 4.8 months with a six-month PFS rate of 43.1 percent. However, the data showed that the median OS was not reached at the time of analysis and the six-month OS rate was 77.9%.The data was presented presented at the 2018 American Society of Clinical Oncology Gastrointestinal (ASCO GI) Cancers Symposium in San Francisco. Notably, Keytruda is already marketed for several cancer indications, including lung cancer, melanoma, head and neck cancer, classical hodgkin lymphoma and bladder cancer.Last week, Merck announced that Keytruda, in combination with Lilly’s  (LLY  -  Free Report) Alimta (pemetrexed) and acisplatin or carboplatin, met dual primary endpoints in a phase III KEYNOTE-189 study. The combination was evaluated for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic non-squamous NSCLC. The study met both its primary endpoints, progression-free survival (PFS) and OS (co-primary endpoint).We remind investors at the third quarter 2017 call, Merck had mentioned that it is including the overall survival (OS) as a co-primary endpoint in the KEYNOTE-189 study, which could defer the readout from the study to 2019. It was then estimated that the study would complete in February 2019 Therefore the one year earlier than expected positive read out of KEYNOTE-189 study was a big boost to the company.Shares of Merck have lost 0.9% in the past one year compared unfavorably with the industry’s 23.9% increase. We remind investors that Keytruda is a key top-line driver for Merck and it brought in $1.5 billion sales in third-quarter 2017, up 18.8% sequentially and 194% year over year. Sales continue to be driven by a launch of new indications globally.Significantly, Keytruda sales in the United States have gained particularly from a strong momentum in the new indication of first-line lung cancer. Meanwhile, the Keytruda development program also significantly advanced in 2017 with regulatory approvals for four new indications in the United States and two additional diseases in Europe.Keytruda is continuously growing and expanding into new indications and markets globally. It is under trial for more than 30 types of cancer in above 650 studies including excess of 300 combination studies.Merck is collaborating separately with several companies namely Amgen, Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report)  Incyte, Glaxo and Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) for the evaluation of Keytruda in combination with other regimens. Merck & Company, Inc. Price  Merck & Company, Inc.

These licensing agreements are expected to provide regular funds to the company.Nektar’s shares have substantially outperformed the industry in a year, skyrocking 466.6% while the industry has registered a rise of 10.4%.  We are pleased with Nektar's efforts to build its pipeline. The company has a robust pipeline of early and late-stage candidates. Nektar has made a significant progress with its lead candidate Onzeald (formerly known as NKTR-102), currently under accelerated assessment in the EU for treating adults with advanced breast cancer as well as brain metastases. A response is anticipated within the first half of 2018.Nektar has also initiated a randomized phase III confirmatory study (ATTAIN) on Onzeald compared with the single-agent chemotherapy of the respective physician’s choice. The trial is being conducted on patients with advanced breast cancer, who shortly complain of brain metastases. Positive results from this evaluation could support a regulatory filing in the United States.The company is further developing several other candidates across important therapeutic areas including oncology, pain, anti-infectives and immunology. Interesting ones include NKTR-181 (phase III – chronic pain), NKTR-214 (phase I/II – solid tumor) and NKTR-358 (phase I-autoimmune disease).We remind investors that in July 2017, Nektar had announced positive top-line results from an oral human abuse potential study on NKTR-181 in order to assess the abuse potential compared with oxycodone. Notably, the FDA granted a Fast Track designation to the NKTR-181 development program.Successful development and commercialization of these candidates will in turn drive the company’s revenues, considering the lucrative markets they target.Importantly, Nektar entered into a co-development deal with Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) for NKTR-358 last July. Pursuant to this agreement, Nektar will be responsible for completing the ongoing phase I study on the candidate. However, going forward, with the phase II trial on the same, Lilly will be capturing 75% of the total costs, which should further lower Nektar’s development expenses on NKTR-358.However, Nektar’s proprietary market products as well as its underdeveloped candidates are subject to stiff competition from various other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies.The company is expected to face intense rivalry in the pain market with several manufacturers developing pain therapies. Competitors include Collegium Pharmaceutical’s Xtampza and Teva Pharmaceutical’s naproxen to name a few. Also, players in PEGylation and polymer conjugate chemistry technology space are Biogen, Savient Pharmaceuticals, Dr. Reddy’s and Novo Nordisk among others.Nektar’s heavy reliance on partners for revenues still remains a huge concern, since partnership-related setbacks may seriously weigh on the company.Nektar Therapeutics Price Nektar Therapeutics Price | Nektar Therapeutics Quote Zacks RankNektar carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1055,LLY,"This week Eli Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) announced an all-cash deal tobuy immuno-oncology biotech, ARMO Biosciences, Inc. . J&J’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) multiple myeloma drug Darzalex gained FDA approval for combination use in first-line setting while Roche (RHHBY  -  Free Report) announced a couple of regulatory/pipeline updates on its PD-L1 inhibitor, Tecentriq. AstraZeneca (AZN  -  Free Report) sold rights to a schizophrenia product and its PARP inhibitor, Lynparza gained marketing approval in the EU.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesLilly to Expand Immunotherapy Pipeline with ARMO: Eli Lilly announced a definitive agreement to buy California-based immuno-oncology biotech ARMO BioSciences for $50 per share or approximately $1.6 billion in an all-cash deal. The acquisition will add ARMO's lead product candidate, pegilodecakin to Lilly’s cancer pipeline. Pegilodecakin, a PEGylated IL-10, is being studied in a late-stage study in pancreatic cancer as well as early-stage studies in lung and renal cell cancer, melanoma and other solid tumor types. ARMO BioSciences went public in January this year.Lilly has a well laid out oncology strategy, which involves building on key cancer treatments like Cyramza, Lartruvo and Verzenio as foundational agents while focusing on developing new standard-of-care changing therapies and combination regimens, including immuno-therapies. The ARMO BioSciences acquisition, which adds a promising next generation immunotherapy pipeline asset to Lilly’s portfolio, is in line with this strategy. The transaction is expected to close by the end of the second quarter of 2018J&J Darzalex Gets FDA Nod in First Line Setting: J&J’s multiple myeloma drug, Darzalexgained FDA approval in first-line setting. With the latest approval, Darzalex can now be prescribed in combination with bortezomib, melphalan and prednisone (VMP) for the treatment ofpatients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who are ineligible for autologous stem cell transplantation. With theapproval in first-line setting expected this year, it is expected that Darzalex saleswill improve further,going forward.J&J also announced data from two phase III studies evaluating its investigational compound esketamine nasal spray in combination with newly initiated oral antidepressant (“NIOD”) in patients with treatment-resistant depression compared to placebo nasal spray and the NIOD. The combination demonstrated a statistically significant, clinically meaningful rapid reduction of depressive symptoms on treatment with flexibly dosed esketamine nasal spray plus NIOD compared to placebo plus NIOD in the study in adults. However, in the study conducted on elderly patients aged 65 and older, though the esketamine arm witnessed clinically meaningful effects compared to the placebo arm, the study narrowly missed statistical significance for its primary efficacy endpoint. The results were presented at the annual meeting of the American Psychiatric Association.AstraZeneca Sells Seroquel Rights to Luye Pharma: AstraZeneca announced an agreement to sell Seroquel and Seroquel XR, a treatment for schizophrenia and bipolar disease, rights in the UK, China and other international markets to Luye Pharma Group. The total consideration is $538 million, which includes upfront payment of $260 million as well as certain future payments to AstraZeneca. The transaction, expected to close in the second quarter, is part of the company’s efforts to focus on its three main therapy areas of Oncology, Cardiovascular, Renal & Metabolism and Respiratory.Sales of Seroquel/Seroquel XR have been declining as the drug is facing generic competition since November 2016. In 2017, Seroquel XR recorded sales of $332 million, representing a year-over year decline of 55%.AstraZeneca& Merck’s PARP inhibitor, Lynparza(tablets) gained EUapproval for use as a maintenance therapy in platinum-sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer, regardless of patients’ BRCA mutation status. The approval thus expands the eligible patient population for Lynparza. Approval for the same indication in the United States was received in August last year.Roche’s Tecentriq in Focus: Roche’s supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for label expansion of its PD-L1 inhibitor Tecentriq was granted priority review by the FDA. With the latest application, Roche is looking to get Tecentriq approved in combination with Avastin (bevacizumab) plus carboplatin and paclitaxel for first-line treatment of advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The FDA’s decision is expected on Sep 5, 2018.Tecentriq is presently marketed for the treatment of second-line metastatic NSCLC. Label expansion in first-line setting should boost the drug’s sales further. Tecentriq is also approved for the treatment of patients suffering from locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC) who are not eligible for cisplatin chemotherapy. The drug recorded sales of CHF457 million in 2017.In another news on Tecentriq, Roche announced that a late-stage study evaluating the drug in combination with Cotellic in heavily pre-treated patients with advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) did not meet its primary endpoint of overall survival (OS) compared to regorafenib.The NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index rose 1.6% in the last five trading sessions. Large Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % Return  Large Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % Return Here is how the seven major stocks performed in the last five trading sessions:All stocks were in the green last week except Bristol Myers (BMY  -  Free Report), which declined 0.6%.

1056,LLY,"Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) announced that a supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for its anti-PD-1 therapy, Keytruda, has been accepted under priority review by the FDA.With the latest application, Merck is looking to expand the label of Keytruda for the treatment of advanced cervical cancer with disease progression on or after chemotherapy. With the FDA granting priority review, a decision is expected on Jun 28.This is the first time that the FDA has accepted a filing for an anti-PD-1 therapy in cervical cancer. Meanwhile, this is the fourteenth regulatory submission for Keytruda accepted by the FDA. The sBLA was based in part on data from phase II KEYNOTE-158 study.This year so far, Merck’s shares have underperformed the industry. Merck’s shares have declined 1.6% in the period against 1.4% increase for the industry.Keytruda is the second largest product in the Merck portfolio. It is marketed for many types of cancer and treatment settings including lung cancer, melanoma, head and neck cancer, classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma, gastric cancer, bladder cancer and microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient cancer.The treatment fetched sales of $3.8 billion in 2017, up almost 172% year over year. This upside is driven by the global launch of new indications, which further boosted demand.  Keytruda sales are gaining, particularly from strong momentum in the first-line lung cancer indication. It is the only anti-PD-1 approved in the first-line setting both as a monotherapy as well as a combination therapy with Eli Lilly’s (LLY  -  Free Report) cancer drug Alimta (pemetrexed) and carboplatin (pem/carbo).The Keytruda development program also significantly advanced in 2017 with several regulatory approvals in the United States, Europe and Japan. The new approvals expanded the patient population, driving up sales last year. The positive momentum is expected to continue in 2018 as well.Meanwhile, Keytruda is being studied for more than 30 types of cancer, in more than 700 studies, including in excess of 400 combination studies. Merck is collaborating with several companies including Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report), Incyte, Glaxo (GSK  -  Free Report) and Pfizer separately for the evaluation of Keytruda in combination with other regimens.Merck carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1057,LLY,"AVEO Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (AVEO  -  Free Report) reported first-quarter 2018 loss of 8 cents per share, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 7 cents but narrower than the year-ago loss of 12 cents. However, excluding gains related to a change in fair value of warrant liability, the company reported a loss of 6 cents per share.AVEO’s first drug, Fotivda (tivozanib) received EU approval in August 2017 for the first-line treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma (“RCC”). The company is focused on launching the drugs in the European countries. Currently, the drug is available in Germany, Austria and the United Kingdom. The company is entitled to receive double-digit royalty payments from EUSA Pharma on net sales of the drug in Europe. However, Fotivda is not yet approved in the United States for RCC.The company did not record any Fotivda sales during the quarter. AVEO’s top line comprises collaboration and licensing revenues and partnership royalties. Total revenues in the first quarter were approximately $1 million, down 59.5% from the year-ago figure. Revenues were almost in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.98 million.Shares of the company crashed 10% on May 8, presumably as the company said it is postponing the data readout from key phase III TIVO-3 study. AVEO’s share price movement shows that the stock has underperformed the industry so far this year. Specifically, the company’s shares have lost 20.3% compared with the industry’s decrease of 11.9%.Operating ExpensesResearch & development expenses were down 32.1% to about $5.4 million. However, general and administrative expenses increased 12% year over year to $2.6 million.Cash GuidanceAVEO expects that its present cash resources of $27 million will allow the company to fund its planned operations through the first quarter of 2019.Pipeline UpdatesConcurrent with the earnings release, the company announced that it is deferring the anticipated topline data readout from TIVO-3 study evaluating Fotivda in first-line RCC in the third quarter of 2018. It was previously expected in the second quarter. AVEO is conducting the study to address the overall survival concerns from the TIVO-1 study identified by the FDA. Data from TIVO-3 study along with TIVO-1 study will be included in the regulatory application for approval of Fotivda in the United States.In April, AVEO announced the launch of Fotivda by its partner EUSA Pharma in Austria. In February, the drug was launched in the United Kingdom which triggered a milestone payment of $2 million from EUSA Pharma.In February 2018, AVEO announced data from the phase II portion of TiNivo study evaluating tivozanib in combination with Bristol-Myers’ (BMY  -  Free Report) PD1 inhibitor, Opdivo, in metastatic RCC. Data from the study showed that 64% patients achieved ORR. The disease control rate achieved by the combination therapy was 100%. In January, data presented from a phase I/II study evaluating Fotivda in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma showed that Fotivda achieved a median PFS of 5.5 months at week 24. The median OS achieved was 7.5 months.Apart from Fotivda, AVEO is also developing ficlatuzumab in combination with Lilly’s (LLY  -  Free Report) Erbitux in a phase II study for treating metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Another phase Ib study is evaluating ficlatuzumab in combination with Nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine in treatment-naive pancreatic cancer. These studies were initiated in December last year.Other UpdatesIn February, the company appointed industry veteran, John H. Johnson, with over 30 years of experience to its board of directors.In January, AVEO announced that it has refinanced its existing debt facility of $20 million with Hercules Capital. The company said that the terms of the new facility will help it to have an additional $12.1 million in cash flow over 2018 and 2019 compared to the prior loan.AVEO Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

1058,LLY,"Total earnings for 83.1% of the total healthcare market capitalization are up 14.7% on revenue growth of 8.1%. The growth rates seem unimpressive when compared with some of the other sectors. Earnings and revenue beat ratios of 88.9% and 75%, respectively, are also not great either.Among the most notable players, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) was the first major drug company to report earnings on Apr 17, followed by Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) on Apr 24 and Apr 26, respectively. Other major U.S. drug companies — Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) and Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) — reported on May 1. These industry bigwigs came up with earnings or revenue beat or both.Earnings in FocusJohnson and JohnsonThe world's biggest maker of healthcare products continued its long streak of earnings beat. Earnings per share came in at $2.06, 5 cents ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate and 12.6% higher than the year-ago quarter. Revenues grew 12.9% year over year to $20.01 billion and edged past the estimated $19.4 billion. Johnson & Johnson raised its revenue guidance from $80.60-$81.40 billion to $81.0-$81.8 billion but maintained its earnings per share outlook of $8.00-$8.20, which reflects growth of 6.8%-9.6% (read: Healthcare ETFs in Focus After Johnson & Johnson Q1 Earnings).PfizerThe U.S. drug giant surpassed earnings estimates but lagged on revenues. Earnings per share of 77 cents came in 3 cents above the Zacks Consensus Estimate while revenues of $12.9 billion fell shy of the estimated $13.1 billion. On an annual basis, earnings per share and revenues rose 12% and 1%, respectively.

1059,LLY,"United Therapeutics Corporation (UTHR  -  Free Report) reported adjusted earnings of $3.76 per share for the first quarter of 2018, which rose 4% from the year-ago quarter due to lower SG&A costs and tax rate. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was pegged at $3.46 per share. Adjusted earnings excluded the impact of share-based compensation gains.Revenues for the reported quarter were $389.2 million, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $385 million. Revenues rose 5% year over year. Sales, however, declined 16.3% sequentially due to unfavorable timing/pricing of distributor orders.United Therapeutics’ first-quarter revenues are usually down or flat from the prior-year fourth quarter levels due to unfavorable timing and magnitude of distributor orders, which are typically placed once a month based on current utilization trends and contractual minimum inventory requirements.Shares of United Therapeutics were down almost 7% on Wednesday. In fact, the stock has underperformed the industry this year so far, having declined 29.5% compared with the industry's decline of 2.5% during the period. Quarter in DetailUnited Therapeutics markets four products for the treatment of PAH – Remodulin, Tyvaso, Adcirca and Orenitram. Please note that United Therapeutics bought exclusive rights to commercialize Adcirca (tadalafil) for the treatment of PAH in the United States from Eli Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) in November 2008. Lilly markets tadalafil as Cialis for erectile dysfunction. Lilly carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Adcirca sales were $97.6 million, up 22% year over year driven by price increases.Orenitram sales amounted to $52.2 million in the quarter, up 33% year over year due to patient growth and a one-time positive impact from an amendment in contractual minimum inventory levels with a U.S. distributor. Remodulin sales were $126.8 million, down 13% year over year due to a reduction in orders from U.S. and international distributors. Tyvaso sales totaled 94.6 million, up 8% year over year due to price increases. However, the amendment in contractual minimum inventory levels, discussed above, hurt sales of both Remodulin and Tyvaso.Please note that Remodulin and Adcirca are expected to face generic competition this year, which could reduce sales from these products.Unituxin’s (for the treatment of pediatric patients with high-risk neuroblastoma) sales of $18.0 million were flat year over year.Research and development (R&D) expenses escalated 41% to $58.2 million due to higher costs to support the company’s pipeline of cardiopulmonary and cancer drugs and to develop its organ manufacturing projects.Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses declined 4% to $66.1 million.Pipeline Update United Therapeutics is working on expanded indications for some of its marketed products like Orenitram and Tyvaso. The company, at present, has seven phase III programs in the fields of cardiopulmonary diseases and oncology. A phase III FREEDOM-EV study is evaluating an oral combination therapy of Orenitram –OreniPlus. Full data from this study is expected this year. Meanwhile, a phase III BEAT study is evaluating Tysuberprost - esuberaprost in combination with Tyvaso. Data from this study is also expected this year.United Therapeutics is also working on new delivery mechanisms for Remodulin. The company is working with Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report) to get RemoSynch, an implantable pump for delivering Remodulin intravenously, approved by the FDA. In order to launch RemoSynch in the United States, United Therapeutics and Medtronic are pursuing parallel regulatory filings related to the device and the drug. Medtronic premarket approval application (PMA) for the catheter for RemoSynch was approved by the FDA in December 2017. United Therapeutics resubmitted its new drug application to get RemoSynch approved by the FDA in January. With a six-month review period, FDA action is expected on Jul 30. United Therapeutics expects to launch the RemoSynch system by early 2019.United Therapeutics has also developed a pre-filled, semi-disposable pump system for subcutaneous delivery of Remodulin (RemUnity) in partnership with DEKA. In February 2018, DEKA filed RemUnity with the FDA (510(k) filing) that was accepted for review by the FDA.Clinical studies on RemoPro, a pain-free new chemical entity version of treprostinil, are expected to begin this year.Several data read-outs and regulatory updates are expected in 2018.To Acquire SteadyMedEarlier this week, United Therapeutics announced a definitive merger agreement with SteadyMed Ltd. (STDY  -  Free Report). United Therapeutics will acquire SteadyMed for $216 million including contingent payments. With the deal, United Therapeutics will add SteadyMed’s drug device pipeline product Trevyent for PAH patients to its portfolio, which could have posed competition to United Therapeutics’ RemoSynch.Trevyent is a single-use, pre-filled pump that has been developed by SteadyMed to deliver a two-day supply of treprostinil subcutaneously using SteadyMed’s PatchPump technology to treat PAH. Though SteadyMed received a refuse-to-file letter from the FDA for want of further information, SteadyMed intends to resubmit its NDA by the end of 2018. United Therapeutics Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  United Therapeutics Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | United Therapeutics Corporation Quote 5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

1060,LLY,"Last week, U.S. Senator Tina Smith expressed concerns that big pharma companies plan to use their large corporate tax savings to reward shareholders instead of bringing down costs of expensive drugs and benefiting consumers. The Senator questioned through letters to CEOs of five big pharma companies — Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report), Merck (MRK  -  Free Report), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report), AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) and Abbott Labs (ABT  -  Free Report) — how they plan to use their extra cash.Please note that on their Q4 conference calls held earlier this year, most big pharma companies discussed what they plan to do with the extra cash they save from the new tax bill. These companies plan to invest the extra cash in capital expenditures, products/pipeline, in-licensing or acquisition deals or rewarding shareholders through higher dividends and share buybacks. Not many talked about taking any steps to lower prescription drug costs.This apart, key announcements this week included the failure of Dermira, Inc.’s (DERM  -  Free Report) acne candidate in two pivotal late-stage studies, Merck’s oncology collaboration with Japan’s Eisai, expansion of Jardiance clinical studies by Eli Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) and FDA committee backing for Pfizer’s Xeljanz for the third indication.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesDermira Shares Sink as Acne Candidate Fails: Shares of Dermira plunged after it announced that its acne candidate, olumacostat glasaretil, surprisingly failed to meet the primary endpoint in either of the two pivotal phase III studies -- CLAREOS-1 and CLAREOS-2. The company said that it will likely stop olumacostat glasaretil’s development following this failure. (Read More: Dermira's Acne Candidate Fails in Pivotal Trials, Shares Sink)Merck to Jointly Develop Eisai’s Cancer Drug Lenvima: Similar to last year’s profit sharing deal with AstraZeneca (AZN  -  Free Report), Merck announced an oncology collaboration with Japan’s Eisai Co., Ltd. Per this deal, the companies will jointly develop and commercialize Eisai’s tyrosine kinase inhibitor, Lenvima, both as a monotherapy and in combination with Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy, Keytruda for several types of cancer. For the deal, Merck will give Eisai an upfront payment of $300 million. The companies will share global development and marketing costs as well as gross profits from Lenvima equally.

1061,LLY,"Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) announced an oncology collaboration with Japan’s Eisai Co., Ltd to jointly develop and commercialize the latter’s tyrosine kinase inhibitor, Lenvima, both as a monotherapy as well as in combination with Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy, Keytruda, for several types of cancer. For the deal, Merck will pay Eisai an upfront amount of $300 million.Lenvima, developed by Eisai, is presently approved for the treatment of thyroid cancer as a monotherapy and second-line treatment of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) — a type of kidney cancer — in combination with Novartis’ (NVS  -  Free Report) Afinitor (everolimus). Meanwhile, Lenvima monotherapy is under review in the United States, EU and Japan for hepatocellular carcinoma, a type of liver cancer. Also, late-stage studies are already ongoing to evaluate Lenvima in separate combination studies with Keytruda and Afinitor for RCC. Meanwhile, the Keytruda/Lenvima combination enjoys Breakthrough Therapy Designation from FDA in RCC.Merck and Eisai plan to jointly develop Lenvima across six cancer types and 11 potential indications. The companies will share global development and marketing costs, as well as gross profits from Lenvima equally. However, Eisai will book Lenvima worldwide product sales both as a monotherapy and in combination.Other than the upfront payment, Merck will also pay up to $650 million for certain option rights through 2020, as well as $450 million as reimbursements for R&D costs. Other than these, Eisai will be entitled to regulatory/sales milestone payments of up to $4.36 billion.So far this year, Merck’s shares have underperformed the industry. Merck’s shares have declined 3.2% in the period compared with a 1.9% decrease for the industry.Keytruda is the second-largest product in the Merck portfolio. It is marketed for many types of cancer and treatment settings including lung cancer, melanoma, head and neck cancer, classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma, gastric cancer, bladder cancer and microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient cancer.The treatment fetched sales of $3.8 billion in 2017, up almost 172% year over year. This upside is driven by the global launch of new indications, further boosting demand. Keytruda sales are gaining, particularly from a strong momentum in the indication of first-line lung cancer, as it is the only anti-PD-1 approved in the first-line setting both as a monotherapy as well as a combination therapy with Eli Lilly’s (LLY  -  Free Report) cancer drug Alimta (pemetrexed) and carboplatin (pem/carbo).The Keytruda development program also significantly advanced in 2017 with several regulatory approvals in the United States, Europe and Japan. The new approvals expanded the patient population, driving up sales last year. The positive momentum is expected to continue in 2018 as well.Meanwhile, Keytruda is being studied for more than 30 types of cancer, exceeding 700 studies, including in excess of 400 combination studies. Merck is collaborating with several companies including Amgen, Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report), Incyte, Glaxo and Pfizer separately for the evaluation of Keytruda in combination with other regimens.We expect Merck to present data from several key Keytruda studies this year, including a combination study with Incyte’s epacadostat in first-line metastatic melanoma. Also, Keytruda could get an approval for the relapsed or refractory primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma indication this year with FDA action expected in April.Merck carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1062,LLY,"In spite of the increasing incidence of Alzheimer's, there is no recognized drug that can cure or slow the progress of the disease. The Alzheimer's Association claims that in every 66 seconds, an American develops Alzheimer's. People living with Alzheimer's find it extremely difficult to carry out daily functions and hence need to be under supervision round the clock.Coming to other life-threatening conditions, CNBC reports that deaths related to Alzheimer’s have skyrocketed 89% while those following heart diseases have dropped 14% since the turn of the century.Detection Years Before Onset of Alzheimer'sA blood test has been introduced to detect Alzheimer's almost two decades before a patient shows any noticeable symptoms. Last year, Dr. Randall Bateman of Washington University announced that the test will be able to detect the accumulation of amyloid beta in the brain. The buildup of the toxic protein is among the first signs of the deadly disease.Also, in January, a team of researchers from Japan and Australia introduced a blood test with accuracy as high as 90% for the detection of the disease. Dr. Bateman employed the mass spectrometry testing for identifying the protein. According to the email of Bateman to CNBC, scientists from Japan had developed an identical mass-spectrometry investigative procedure for protein detection which came up with similar results.  Blood Tests to Speed Up Drug ResearchClinical trials for drugs that could delay the start of the disease failed a number of times, thanks to the unavailability of a decent number of qualified patients, revealed Dr. Jeff Cummings of the Cleveland Clinic. Hence, the wider the patient base, higher will be the possibility of meaningful clinical trials.With the new blood tests, doctors will be able to detect patients early and include them in clinical trials for the development of effective preventive treatments. Also, there would be proper utilization of millions of dollars of federal government funding for the preventive treatment.Importantly, the blood tests will be the most efficient way to detect Alzheimer's as other alternatives are quite expensive. Lumbar puncture for the early diagnosis is among the alternatives that collect cerebrospinal fluid. For the process, a needle is inserted in the lower back of patients, giving rise to the need for local anesthetic. Positron emission tomography is another process that could cost at least $7000. Also, the accuracy of the PET scans is significantly lower than the blood tests.Dr. Robert Vassar of Northwestern University has also backed the efficiency of blood tests over other methods for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's. Meanwhile, Dr. Bateman added that the blood tests will be more in demand once proper preventive measures have been established.Stocks to GainPeople all over the world will likely gain access to the tests in the coming few years, per Dr. Bateman.However, the question that looms large is what is the next course of action for those who find out that they are at a risk of developing Alzheimer’s? Meanwhile, the launch of the blood tests paves the way for advanced clinical trials.More than 5 million people are estimated to be living with the disease in the United States, per The Alzheimer's Association. Notably, the health organization expects this number to rise more than three times by 2050.As Alzheimer's is a pressing concern, there is massive business potential in this space. Hence, the launch of the blood tests will help companies focused on developing preventive treatments make billions.Based in Cambridge, MA, Biogen Inc. (BIIB  -  Free Report) has been paying particular attention on stepping up research work on Alzheimer’s. The company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters, the average positive earnings surprise being 6.9%. Also, we expect the company to witness earnings growth of 13.7% and 4.7% in 2018 and 2019, respectively.It has been almost 30 years that Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) — headquartered in Indianapolis, IN — is fighting Alzheimer’s. The company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the last four quarters. We also expect the company to post earnings growth of 13.1% and 8.8% in 2018 and 2019, respectively.In fact, for treating patients with early Alzheimer’s symptoms, AstraZeneca PLC (AZN  -  Free Report) and Eli Lilly are jointly developing Lanabecestat — a small molecule therapy candidate.Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report), headquartered in Kenilworth, NJ, has been focusing on research for treating Alzheimer's.

1063,LLY,"AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) shares jumped 13.8% following the release of better-than-expected fourth quarter 2017 results and an upbeat outlook for 2018. Results were driven by the performance of Humira, Imbruvica and Mavyret. Imbruvica continued to witness strong uptake for the chronic lymphocytic leukemia (“CLL”) indication while Humira’s performance was driven by robust demand despite the introduction of new mechanisms of action and competition from indirect biosimilars. Meanwhile, Mavyret (hepatitis C virus – HCV) has been witnessing strong uptake in both the United States and international markets. Mavyret exited 2017 with a market share of 32% in the United States and is expected to become a major growth driver for the company.Rosy Outlook for 2018: The company provided an upbeat outlook for 2018 reflecting Mavyret’s strong uptake, the continued robust underlying performance from other products, and a lower tax rate thanks to the passage of the U.S. tax reform. AbbVie expects 2018 earnings per share in the range of $7.33 - $7.43 on revenues of almost $32 billion. The mid-point of the earnings guidance range reflects year-over-year growth of 32%, an improvement over the company’s previously provided guidance of 17% growth at the mid-point (provided with third quarter results).Humira sales are expected to grow approximately 13% - 14% in the United States while ex-U.S. sales are expected to be about $6.2 billion. The company expects to record Imbruvica revenues of more than $3.3 billion in 2018. Mavyret sales are expected to cross $2.5 billion. Other products like Venclexta, AndroGel, and Duodopa are expected to record sales of $300 million plus, $475 million, and $458 million, respectively. Creon sales are expected to grow 10% in 2018 while Synagis, Lupron and Synthroid sales are expected to remain flat. Zinbryta sales are expected to come in below $100 million reflecting the impact of competition and label changes.Cash Repatriation/Capital Deployment: The U.S. tax reform will allow AbbVie more efficient access to its foreign cash and the ability to use it in the United States. The company intends to invest about $2.5 billion in capital within the United States in the next five years and is currently evaluating additional expansion of its U.S. facilities. AbbVie also intends to accelerate pension funding by $750 million and enhance non-executive employee compensation. The company is also planning a one-time shareable contribution of about $350 million to select not-for-profit organizations, supporting initiatives such as the Puerto Rico rebuilding efforts, children's healthcare access programs, and certain charities. AbbVie also said that it would be increasing shareholder returns in what could be a combination of acceleration of dividend growth and more share buybacks. Details will be provided later by the company.What about Deals? As far as deals are concerned, the company’s key focus is on opportunities that could drive growth in the 2023-2025 timeframe. AbbVie said that it is looking at early-stage assets.Catalyst Rich 2018: AbbVie’s R&D spend in 2018 is expected to be about 16% of sales, reflecting higher spending to support the late-stage pipeline and mid-stage programs. In addition to working on expanding the label of approved products like Imbruvica and Venclexta, AbbVie’s late-stage pipeline includes candidates like upadacitinib (rheumatoid arthritis – RA, Crohn's disease) and risankizumab (psoriasis, Crohn's disease). AbbVie is looking to file for regulatory approval of risankizumab for the psoriasis indication in the first half of the year while the regulatory filing for upadacitinib for the RA indication is expected in the second half of 2018.Meanwhile, elagolix is under priority review for endometriosis with a response from the FDA expected in the second quarter.AbbVie’s shares are up 103.9% over the last one year, compared to the 29% rally of the industry it belongs to.

1064,LLY,"Merck's (MRK  -  Free Report) shares gained more than 5% on Jan 16, after the company announced that its anti-PD-1 therapy, Keytruda, in combination with Eli Lilly’s (LLY  -  Free Report) Alimta (pemetrexed) and carboplatin (pem/carbo) met dual primary endpoints in a confirmatory phase III KEYNOTE-189 study. The combination was evaluated for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Notably, in May 2017, this combination therapy was granted an accelerated approval by the FDA for the aforementioned indication. Hence, the positive readouts from the phase III confirmatory study will help the company gain a continued approval for the combo therapy.We remind investors that in the third quarter of 2017, the company mentioned that it is including the overall survival (OS) as a co-primary endpoint in the KEYNOTE-189 study of Keytruda in first-line NSCLC, which will defer the readout from the study to 2019. Therefore, the data now released came in much earlier than investor’s expectations, which is a big boost to the company.Merck’s shares have inched up 1% in a year’s time, comparing unfavorably with the 20.3% rally of its industry.  The study was designed to evaluate the combination therapy compared with the chemotherapies alone. The study met both its primary endpoints, progression-free survival (PFS) and OS (co-primary endpoint).Data from the study demonstrated significant improvement in OS and PFS in NSCLC patients receiving Keytruda combo therapy compared with those receiving chemotherapy alone. This was based on an interim analysis conducted by the independent data monitoring committee. It is important to note that Keytruda is the first PD1 inhibitor in combination to show OS in patients with NSCLC.The company said that data from the trial will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting and submitted to regulatory authorities.Significantly, in October last year, Merck also announced that it has withdrawn its European regulatory application, which sought an approval for the combination of Keytruda with Alimta and carboplatin for NSCLC. The application was based on positive data from the cohort G of KEYNOTE-021 trial. However, with this new positive readout, possibility of the drug getting a nod from the EU increases.Note that Roche (RHHBY  -  Free Report) recently presented data on Tecentriq in novel combinations across a broad range of tumors including lung cancer.We remind investors that Keytruda is the first anti-PD-1 therapy to gain an FDA approval and is being studied for more than 30 types of cancer in above 650 studies including 400 plus combination trials. Keytruda fetched in global sales of $2.5 billion in the first nine months of 2017, up 173% year over year.Merck & Company, Inc. Price Merck & Company, Inc. Price | Merck & Company, Inc.

1065,LLY,"The Dow endured a volatile week during which the index hit a fresh record high. A fall in bank shares led to losses for the index on Monday. The index slipped on Tuesday following positive news from a major component. Surging treasury yields led to losses for the index on Wednesday. Ultimately, the index surged to a record high on Thursday following investor optimism over economic growth.Last Week’s PerformanceThe Dow gained 0.9% last Friday due to optimism built around the implementation of the GOP Tax Bill. Such broad-based gains ensured an improvement for three major benchmarks, negating the effects of dismal economic data.Nonfarm payrolls for the month of December came in at 148,000, lower than the consensus estimate of 190,000 job additions. Further, the U.S. trade deficit increased 3.2% in November to settle at $50.5 billion. This is its highest deficit since January 2012. The ISM Services Index for December declined 1.5 points to 55.7%.The index added an impressive 220.7 points on Friday to finish the session above the 25,000 milestone for the second straight day. This marked its third-straight record close in last four trading sessions — its best opening week since 2006. Gains for the blue-chip index were rather broad based.Over last week, the index gained 2.3%. This marked the Dow’s best weekly run since Dec 1, 2017. During this period the Dow touched the psychological level of 25,000 for the first time. This was the index’s fastest 1,000-point rise since its inception in May 1896.Optimism over strong market performance in 2018 contributed to these gains. Favorable economic data, including an upbeat manufacturing report and record construction spending boosted markets.The Dow This WeekThe index lost almost 0.1% or nearly 13 points on Monday due to a fall in bank shares that snapped its winning run. This marked an end to its four-day streak of gains. The blue-chip index hit an intraday record of 25,311.99 earlier in the session but suffered broad based losses to finish in the negative territory.Shares of major banks such as The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS  -  Free Report) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report) declined by 1.5% and about 0.4% respectively and weighed on the Dow. Bank shares declined after analysts estimated that there would be one-time charges to the fourth quarter earnings that the banks would suffer due to the implementation of tax reforms.The index increased 0.4% on Tuesday following reports that The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) had delivered a record number of airplanes in 2017 pushed the Dow into record territory. Such events led to shares of Boeing gaining 2.7%, which contributed as much as 57 points to the Dow.The blue-chip index amassed 120.8 points to finish at a record 25,385.80. What also contributed to Dow’s gains was increase in the shares of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report), which gained 1.6% and added 15 points to the Dow.The index lost 0.1% on Wednesday after yields on the 10-year benchmark note surged following reports that China was considering halting purchase of U.S. Treasuries. Markets also suffered losses after reports from Canada surfaced that its government expects Trump to pull out of NAFTA soon. Meanwhile, cost of imported goods in the United States surged to a six year high.The index gained 0.8% or 205 points on Thursday hitting another all-time high following investor optimism over economic growth. Shares of Boeing gained 2.4%, emerging as the largest contributor for the Dow. The aircraft manufacturer will likely be one of the major beneficiaries of higher economic growth. Meanwhile, the PPI index declined by 0.1%, moving lower for the first time in more than a year.  Components Moving the IndexBoeing’s 2017 deliveries show a 2% rise in commercial shipments and 5.9% decline in defense shipments, on a year-over-year basis.

1066,LLY,"Eli Lilly and Company's (LLY  -  Free Report) animal health subsidiary, Elanco, and partner Aratana Therapeutics, Inc. (PETX  -  Free Report) have together announced that their veterinary medicine, Galliprant (grapiprant tablets), has been granted a marketing authorization in the EU for the treatment of pain associated with mild to moderate osteoarthritis (OA) in dogs.Notably, OA is incurable and is one of the most common causes of chronic pain in dogs. However, if diagnosed early, the pain and inflammation can be controlled, enabling the arthritic dogs to lead an improved quality of life.The drug was approved in the United States in March 2016 for the aforementioned indication and subsequently, launched last January. This is the first piprant approved for use in the United States for once-daily use in dogs with OA. Also, it can be administered to patients as young as nine months.Shares of Lilly have underperformed the industry in a year. The stock has rallied 12%, comparing unfavorably with the industry’s increase of 18.5% in the period.  We remind investors that the approval in the EU was made on the positive opinion granted by the European Medicine Agency’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use, recommending the approval in November 2017.While Lilly’s Elanco has exclusive marketing rights to Galliprant globally, it co-promotes the product with Aratana in the United States.Elanco makes parasiticides, pain and dermatology medicines for food as well as companion animals. Last January, the division acquired German drugmaker Boehringer Ingelheim’s Vetmedica U.S. pet vaccines unit along with a fully integrated manufacturing and R&D (research and development) site for $885 million.Notably, Lilly bought the animal-health division of Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) in early 2015, strengthening the Elanco division of the company. The Elanco segment recorded sales of $740.6 million in third-quarter 2017, up 5% year over year.Eli Lilly and Company Price  Eli Lilly and Company Price | Eli Lilly and Company Quote Zacks Rank & Key PicksLilly carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1067,LLY,"Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) announced that its anti-PD-1 therapy, Keytruda (pembrolizumab), has been approved in Japan for previously-treated patients with urothelial carcinoma, a type of bladder cancer. This approval makes Keytruda eligible to be indicated for four types of cancer in Japan.Notably, Keytruda has already been approved in the United States and the EU for the first and second-line treatments in patients with the aforementioned indication. Apart from bladder cancer, Keytruda is approved for many malignant disease types and treatment settings including lung cancer, melanoma, head and neck cancer and classical hodgkin lymphoma. It is also approved as a combination therapy with Eli Lilly's (LLY  -  Free Report) lung cancer drugs, Alimta (pemetrexed) and carboplatin (pem/carbo).Merck’s shares have lost 6.6% in the last year, comparing unfavorably with the 16% increase of its industry. The approval was based on positive data from phase III KEYNOTE-045 study. The trial outcomes showed a clinically meaningful and improved overall survival (OS) benefit of Keytruda compared with chemotherapy in patients with the given indication. In the program, Keytruda demonstrated a 27% reduction in death risk as compared to chemotherapy. Moreover, the median OS was 10.3 months in the Keytruda arm in comparison to 7.3 with chemotherapy.Significantly, Merck commercializes Keytruda in Japan in collaboration with Taiho Pharmaceutical company.Per the company’s press release, the incidence of bladder cancer in Japan is anticipated to increase over time. Approximately, 66,000 patients are detected with bladder cancer in the country with 21,000 new cases diagnosed in 2015. Hence, the market opportunity for Keytruda is fairly wide in the country.Keytruda fetched in global sales of $2.5 billion in the first nine months of 2017, up 173% year over year. Sales continue to be driven by the launch of new indications globally. Keytruda sales in the United States gained particularly from a strong momentum in the new indication of the first-line therapy of lung cancer. Outside the United States, Keytruda sales were primarily driven by the melanoma indication.We remind investors that Keytruda is the first anti-PD-1 therapy to gain an FDA approval and is being studied for more than 30 types of cancer in above 650 studies including 400 plus combination trials.Merck & Company, Inc.

1068,LLY,"Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) announced that it is discontinuing another study evaluating verubecestat for the treatment of prodromal Alzheimer’s disease as its success was unlikely.APECS was a phase III study evaluating the efficacy and safety of verubecestat, an oral β-amyloid precursor protein site-cleaving enzyme (BACE) inhibitor, versus placebo.The study was stopped on the recommendation of an external data monitoring committee, which assessed the study’s overall benefit/risk during a recent interim safety analysis. The committee said that the chances of observing positive risk/benefit profile in the study, if it continued, were slim.Shares of Merck declined almost 1% on Tuesday. In the past year, Merck’s shares have underperformed the industry. Merck’s shares have declined 15.8% in the period against a 10% increase for the industry.In February last year, Merck had discontinued another study, EPOCH (phase II/III), on verubecestat, which was evaluating it for mild-to-moderate Alzheimer’s disease due to lack of efficacy. At that time, the committee had recommended that the APECS study continue unchanged. The Alzheimer’s disease market has attracted a lot of attention from several companies. However, the successful development of therapies for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease is challenging and we note that several companies have failed in this regard.Last month, Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) reportedly said in a statement that it will end R&D efforts in the Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease areas, which will result in about 300 layoffs.Long back, Pfizer shelved its late-stage Alzheimer’s candidate, bapineuzumab IV after it failed two phase III studies.In December 2017, Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report) announced that an Alzheimer’s disease study on BAN2401 failed to show early positive results, which raised investor concern about the candidate’s chances of success.In November 2016, Lilly’s (LLY  -  Free Report) anti-amyloid candidate solanezumab failed to meet the primary endpoint in a late-stage AD study. Lilly decided to drop the development of solanezumab. Lilly also suffered a major setback in August 2010, when it had to halt the development of another phase III Alzheimer’s candidate, semagacestat.The Alzheimer’s disease market represents huge commercial potential and a successfully developed product could generate billions of dollars in sales once launched.Merck carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1069,LLY,"A new drug application (“NDA”) for Pfizer’s (PFE  -  Free Report) anaplastic lymphoma kinase (“ALK”) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (“TKI”) candidate, lorlatinib has been accepted by the FDA. The NDA sought approval of lorlatinib for the treatment of patients ALK-positive metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (“NSCLC”) who have received prior treatment with one or more ALK TKIs. The NDA has also been granted priority review. A decision is expected in August 2018.Similar applications seeking marketing authorization in Europe and Japan have also been accepted by the regulatory agencies of the respective countries.Shares of Pfizer were up almost 1.5% following the news. The stock has returned 6.3% in the past year, underperforming the industry’s gain of 11% in that period.Pfizer submitted the regulatory applications based on positive data from phase II portion of a phase I/II study, evaluating lorlatinib in several cohorts based on prior therapies.Non-small cell lung cancer occurs in 85% of the patients who have lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer death worldwide.Lung cancer is an attractive avenue for pharmaceutical companies due to the widespread occurrence of the disease. However, it is also one of the most competitive spaces due to the presence of a large number of players. Several large and small companies are either developing or have approved therapies for the treatment of various forms of lung cancer.We remind investors that last month Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) announced encouraging results from a phase III study evaluating its anti-PD-1 therapy, Keytruda, in combination with Eli Lilly’s (LLY  -  Free Report) Alimta and carboplatin in NSCLC.

1070,LLY,"Incyte Corporation (INCY  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 15, before the market opens.Last quarter, the company beat estimates by 183.33%.Incyte’s earnings track record has been mixed so far. Of the last four quarters, the company surpassed expectations in three and missed estimates in one.Overall, Incyte delivered an average positive surprise of 42.9%.  Incyte’s stock lost 33% in the last six months, worse than the industry’s decline of 5.8%.Let’s see, how things are shaping up for this quarter.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Incyte is likely to beat on earnings this quarter because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP  and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.Zacks ESP:  Incyte has an Earnings ESP of +18.86%, representing the difference between the Most Accurate estimate (loss of 40 cents per share) and the Zacks Consensus Estimate (loss of 49 cents). A positive ESP hints at an earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank:  Incyte has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. Further, combined with a positive ESP, chances of an earnings beat are usually pegged higher.We caution against all Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Incyte Corporation Price and EPS Surprise   Incyte Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Incyte Corporation Quote Factors Driving the GrowthIncyte’s lead drug, Jakafi (ruxolitinib), is a first-in-class JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor, approved for the treatment of patients with polycythemia vera (PV), patients with intermediate or high-risk myelofibrosis (MF), including primary MF, post-PV MF, and post-essential thrombocythemia MF. While Incyte markets the drug in the United States, it is marketed by Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) as Jakavi outside the country.Incyte continues to gain traction by Jakafi’s performance. Jakafi sales are being driven by patient demand. Jakafi was included as a recommended treatment for patients with myelofibrosis and patients with polycythemiavera in the latest National Comprehensive Cancer Network (“NCCN”) Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology for myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) in July 2017. This is likely to boost the demand further.Based on strong performance in the first nine months of 2017, the company upped guidance for Jakafi and now expects revenues in the range of $1,125-$1,135 million, up from the earlier projected range of $1,090-$1,120 million.The company is also working to expand the drug’s label. Results from a phase III trial, REACH3 evaluating Jakafi as a treatment for patients with steroid-refractory chronic graft-versus-host disease (“GVHD”) is expected in the first half of 2018. Assuming positive results, Incyte plans to submit a sNDA seeking accelerated approval of Jakafi in this indication in 2018. Further updates are expected along with the fourth-quarter earnings call.We remind investors that while Jakafi sales and royalties are a key component of Incyte’s revenue growth, Iclusig sales and Olumiant royalties are also contributing to the top line.In February 2017, the European Commission approved Olumiant for patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The approval triggered a $65-million payment to Incyte from Eli Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) along with additional potential milestone payments, as well as royalties on sales of Olumiant. The approval provides Incyte with a further valuable source of revenues, given the potential for milestones and royalties under the company’s license agreement with Eli Lilly. Olumiant is being studied for additional indications as well — atopic dermatitis (phase IIa) and systemic lupus erythematosus (phase II).Incyte’s pipeline also holds promise. The phase III trial, ECHO-301, evaluating epacadostat plus Keytruda in patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma is now fully-recruited and data are expected in the first half of 2018.R&D expenses are now expected in the range of $1,250-1,300 million, up from the earlier forecast of $1,050-1,150 billion due to the acceleration of the phase III plans for epacadostat. SG&A expenses are expected in the range of $340-$360 million.A Stock to ConsiderHere is one other health care stocks worth considering with the right combination of elements to beat on earnings:Exelixis (EXEL  -  Free Report), which is expected to release fourth-quarter results on Feb 26, has an Earnings ESP of +21.98% and a Zacks Rank #2.

1071,LLY,"Radius Health, Inc. (RDUS  -  Free Report) reported a loss of $1.59 per share in the fourth quarter of 2017, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate loss of $1.48 and the year-ago quarter loss of $1.22. Increase in general and administrative expenses led to the wider than anticipated net loss year over year.Radius Health, Inc. Price and Consensus Radius Health, Inc. Price and Consensus | Radius Health, Inc. QuoteThe company reported sales of Tymlos (abaloparatide) of $7.7 million surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.7 million.Quarter in DetailResearch and development expenses for the reported quarter were $22.9 million, down 10.5% year over year due to the reduction in R&D expenses associated with the elacestrant projects and the development of Tymlos.  Radius Health received FDA approval for Tymlos in April 2017 for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk of fracture and began shipments to wholesalers at the end of May 2017.Tymlos continues to gain traction with approximately 259 million covered lives and 93% coverage in commercial plans. Tymlos market share reached approximately 32% of new patients starting anabolic therapy (NBRx) and 13% of total prescriptions in the anabolic market.General and administrative expenses for the reported quarter jumped to $50.7 million from $27.5 million primarily due to personnel, promotional, and consulting expenses related to the launch of Tymlos.Pipeline UpdatesThe company is developing two formulations of abaloparatide-SC and abaloparatide-transdermal. A labeling supplement for Tymlos was submitted to the FDA in the fourth quarter with the positive 43-month data from the ACTIVExtend study, which showed continued significant risk reduction in fractures in patients who were transitioned to receive an additional 24 months of bisphosphonate therapy. In January 2018, Radius Health met with the FDA to discuss the regulatory development path for the abaloparatide patch. The FDA agreed that, depending on the study results, a single, randomized, open label, active-controlled, non-inferiority (to abaloparatide-SC) study of up to 500 patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis at high risk of fracture would be sufficient to gain approval for the abaloparatide patch. The primary endpoint in the study will be change in lumbar spine bone mineral density at 12 months. Radius Health expects to initiate this pivotal trial in mid-2019.Meanwhile, Radius Health’ Marketing Authorisation Application “(MAA”) for Eladynos (abaloparatide-SC) for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis in Europe is under review by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”) of the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”). The company however suffered a setback when the CHMP issued a second Day-180 List of Outstanding Issues. In December 2017, the CHMP issued a third Day-180 List of Outstanding Issues and informed the company that it intends to refer the MAA to a scientific advisory group for additional advice. The Company expects an opinion from the CHMP regarding the MAA in the first half of 2018.  Radius Health and the FDA have also agreed on the design of a clinical trial in men with osteoporosis, which, if successful, will form the basis of an sNDA seeking to expand the use of Tymlos to treat men with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture. The study is expected to be initiated in the first quarter of 2018.The company also plans to initiate a clinical trial in men with osteoporosis, which, if successful, will form the basis of an sNDA seeking to expand the label to treat men with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture. The study is expected to be initiated in the first quarter of 2018.Meanwhile, the company presented positive data on elacestrant for breast cancer in December 2017. The FDA also granted Fast Track designation to elacestrant in October 2017. In February 2018, Radius Health obtained scientific advice from the EMA regarding a potential single-arm monotherapy phase II trial of elacestrant in patients with ER-positive/HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Based on feedback from the EMA and the FDA, the company will conduct a single, randomized, controlled phase II trial of elacestrant as a third-line monotherapy in approximately 300 patients with ER positive/HER2 negative advanced/metastatic breast cancer.Our TakeThe company’s wider-than-expected loss in the fourth quarter was due to escalated expenses with the commercialization of Tymlos. The drug continues to gain traction and grab further market share.Radius Health’ shares have gained 0.2% in the last six months compared with the industry’s  gain of 2.7%.Although the osteoporosis market in the United Sates has great potential as approximately 1.4 million postmenopausal women experience an osteoporotic fractur each year, Tymlos is expected to face significant competition from Eli Lilly &Co's (LLY  -  Free Report) Forteo and Amgen's (AMGN  -  Free Report) Prolia.Moreover, the approved label carries a boxed warning of osteosarcoma (a malignant bone tumor). The company also a setback when the CHMP issued a third Day-180 List of Outstanding Issues.Zacks Rank & Key PickRadius Health currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the health care sector is Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN  -  Free Report) which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

1072,LLY,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 7.2% in the past month, underperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is LLY due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Lilly Tops Q4 Earnings and Sales, Ups 2018 Earnings OutlookLilly reported fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share of $1.14, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.08 per share by 5.6%. Earnings rose 20% from the year-ago quarter backed by robust volume-driven growth in new product sales, lower SG&A costs and a higher other income.Including a $1.9 billion charge related to U.S. tax reform and restructuring, amortization and other charges, fourth quarter 2017 loss per share was $1.58 per share  against earnings of 73 cents in the fourth quarter of 2016.Revenues in DetailQuarterly revenues of $6.16 billion also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.96 billion by 3.3%. Sales grew 7% year over year backed by strong performance of new drugs and favorable currency movement, which made up for lower sales of established products like Strattera, Humalog, Cialis and Effient.Volumes rose 4% as strong performance of new products like Trulicity, Taltz, Basaglar, Jardiance and Lartruvo offset decline in sales of established products. Higher realized prices for several drugs also contributed 2% to sales growth in the quarter. Foreign exchange rate also had a favorable impact of 1%.New products drove 12% of volume growth and generated over $1.4 billion in revenues, representing nearly 23% total revenues, up from 22% in the previous quarter. On the other hand, the loss of exclusivity for Cymbalta, Strattera, Effient, Axiron, Zyprexa and Evista hurt volumes by 540 basis points.While U.S. revenues grew 6% to $3.42 billion, ex-U.S. revenues rose 8% to $2.74 billion.Pharmaceutical revenues rose 9% in the quarter. However, worldwide competitive pressure hurt sales in Lilly’s Animal Health segment.Established products that recorded growth during the quarter include Forteo (up 21% to $513.2 million), Humulin (up 2% to $362.6 million), Cymbalta (up 6% to $192.8 million) and Erbitux (up 10% to $168.9 million). Sales of all other established products declined in the quarter.Humalog sales declined 5% to $782.2 million due to lower realized prices in the United States.Alimta sales declined 3% to $525.2 million, reflecting lower demand in ex-U.S. markets due to competitive pressure and loss of exclusivity in certain countries. However, sales of Alimta increased 1% in the United States due to increased volume, partially offset by lower realized prices.Zyprexa sales declined 1% to $152.2 million due to loss of exclusivity in Japan.Cialis sales declined 12% to $597.4 million hurt by worldwide lower demand.Strattera sales declined 60% to $98.3 million. Effient sales declined 56% to $62.3 million in the quarter. Both the drugs saw lower demand due to loss of exclusivity.Among the new products, Trulicity generated revenues of $649 million, up 93% year over year, with U.S. revenues benefiting from growth in the GLP-1 market and market share gains.Cyramza revenues were $204.8 million, up 16% year over year, backed by strong demand. Cyramza’s ex-U.S. revenues increased 15%, benefiting from strong volumes in Japan, partially offset by lower realized prices. U.S. revenues increased 17% driven by increased volume.Jardiance sales rose 88% to $143.2 million, driven by increased market share within the growing SGLT2 class in the United States and increased volume outside the United States.Basaglar recorded revenues of $153.8 million compared with $145.7 million in the previous quarter. It generated revenues of $114.4 million in the United States, almost flat sequentially, as changes in estimates for rebates and discounts, which increased revenues in the third quarter, were missing in the fourth.Taltz brought in sales of $172.5 million compared with $151.3 million in the previous quarter.Lartruvo (olaratumab) generated revenues of $59 million in the fourth quarter compared with $54.5 million in the previous quarter.Olumiant (baricitinib) has been launched in select European countries and in Japan. The drug generated sales of $23.0 million in the fourth quarter compared with $16.4 million in the previous quarter backed by strong launch uptake in Germany.Verzenio, which was launched in the Unites States in the fourth quarter of 2017, generated sales of $21 million.Elanco Animal Health segment sales declined 6% to $790.9 million as worldwide competitive pressure continued to hurt sales in the segment.Food animal products revenues declined 8% hurt by market access pressure and competitive pressure in cattle.Companion animal revenues rose 1% due to inclusion of $36.5 million of revenues from the acquisition of Boehringer Ingelheim Vetmedica's U.S. feline, canine and rabies (acquired in January 2017). Excluding Boehringer Ingelheim, companion animal revenues declined due to competitive pressure and lower U.S. distributor inventory levels.Lilly is exploring strategic alternatives for this business including a sale, merger or creating a separate company through an initial public offer. A decision regarding the same is expected to be announced in July and Lilly may ultimately opt to retain the business.Gross Margin & Operating IncomeAdjusted gross margin of 76.5% in the quarter decreased 90 basis points as manufacturing efficiencies and higher realized prices were offset by negative product mix and the effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold. Excluding the effects of foreign exchange on international inventory sold, gross margins increased over 130 bps.Operating income increased 20% year over year to $1.46 billion due to lower operating costs. Total operating expenses (including research and development and marketing, selling and administrative expenses), as a percent of revenues, declined 340 basis points in the quarter to 52.8%.While marketing, selling and administrative expenses declined 1%, R&D expenses rose 2% in the quarter.2017 ResultsFull-year 2017 sales of $22.87 billion topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $22.65 billion. Revenues were within the guided range of $22.4 billion and $22.7 billion. Sales rose 8% year over year.Adjusted earnings for 2017 were $4.28 per share, topping the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.22 per share as well as the guided range of $4.15 to $4.25. Earnings rose 22% year over year.2018 EPS Guidance UppedLilly raised its previously issued 2018 adjusted earnings outlook to reflect the expected benefit from the new tax laws. Adjusted earnings per share are now expected in the range of $4.81 to $4.91 compared with $4.60 to $4.70 expected previously. However, revenues are still expected in the range of $23.0 billion and $23.5 billion.Gross margin is expected to be approximately 75%, same as previously expected. Adjusted tax rate is expected to be approximately 18% (previously approximately 21.5%).Marketing, selling and administrative expenses are still expected in the range of $6.1–$6.4 billion, while research and development expenses are projected to be $5.0-$5.2 billion.Going forward, new products like Trulicity, Taltz, Basaglar, Cyramza, Jardiance, Lartruvo, Verzenio and Olumiant are expected to drive revenues. In 2018, Animal Health revenues are expected to be flat to slightly up versus 2017. After being slightly negative in the first half, Animal Health revenues are expected to improve in the second half supported by new product launches.Expected Impact of U.S. Tax ReformAs a result of the new tax laws, Lilly anticipates paying taxes on overseas cash and earnings of approximately $3.6 billion. With increased access to foreign cash following the U.S. tax reforms, Lilly believes now it will have more than $9 billion of extra funds across its global operations, which it does not intend to hold for a long time. Over 2018 and 2019, Lilly plans to use this cash first to support its products/pipeline, then for business development via in-licensing or acquisition and finally to return to shareholders via dividend and share buybacks. It also plans to use roughly $2 billion of repatriated cash to reduce its gross debt level.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. There has been one revision lower for the current quarter.Eli Lilly and Company Price and Consensus  Eli Lilly and Company Price and Consensus | Eli Lilly and Company QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, LLY has a great Growth Score of A, though it is lagging a lot on the momentum front with a C.

1073,LLY,"Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) announced that its new advanced breast cancer treatment Verzenio (abemaciclib) has gained FDA approval in first-line setting.With the latest approval, Verzenio is approved in combination with an aromatase inhibitor (AI -either anastrozole or letrozole) as initial endocrine-based therapy in postmenopausal women with HR+, HER2- advanced/metastatic breast cancer who have had no prior systemic treatment for the advanced disease.Lilly’s shares have declined 5% this year so far while the industry recorded an increase of 0.8%.The approval was based on positive interim results from MONARCH 3 study. The study compared Verzenio, a CDK 4/6 inhibitor, plus an AI versus an AI plus placebo in the above mentioned patients. Data from the study showed that Verzenio plus an AI substantially reduced tumor size and delayed disease progression in such patientsVerzenio is already marketed for two breast cancer indications - as a monotherapy for the treatment of HR+, HER2- advanced breast cancer who had prior endocrine therapy and chemotherapy for metastatic disease; and as a combination therapy with AstraZeneca's (AZN  -  Free Report) Faslodex (fulvestrant)in HR+, HER2- advanced breast cancer patients who had disease progression following endocrine therapy.Verzenio was launched in the United States in the fourth quarter of 2017 and generated sales of $21 million in the first quarter of its launch. We believe that Verzenio’s label expansion in the previously untreated breast cancer population would drive sales higher in future quarters. Verzenio is under review in the EU.Other available CDK4/6 inhibitors in the market include Pfizer, Inc.’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Ibrance and Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) Kisqali.Lilly carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1074,LLY,"With the rise in demand for immuno-oncology drugs and their combinations, Merck & Co., Inc.’s (MRK  -  Free Report) anti-PD-1 therapy, Keytruda, is fast becoming the key top-line driver of the pharma giant.Keytruda is marketed for many types of cancers and treatment settings including lung cancer, melanoma, head and neck cancer, classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma and bladder cancer.Having crossed the $1-billion mark in sales during the third quarter of 2017, Keytruda became the second largest product in the Merck portfolio. The treatment fetched in sales of $2.51 billion in the first nine months of 2017, up 174% year over year. This upside is driven by the global launch of new indications, which further boosts demand. Keytruda sales are gaining particularly from a strong momentum in the indication of first-line lung cancer as the therapy is the only anti-PD-1 approved in the first-line setting.The Keytruda development program also significantly advanced in 2017with regulatory approvals secured for six new indications in the United States, four in Europe and three in Japan. Key approvals for indications included advanced bladder cancer, advanced microsatellite instability-high cancers and the first approval of a combination therapy with Eli Lilly’s (LLY  -  Free Report) cancer drugs Alimta (pemetrexed) and carboplatin (pem/carbo) for first-line lung cancer.The new approvals expanded the patient population, driving up sales in the third quarter. This momentum should be maintained in the fourth quarter and in 2018 as well.Meanwhile, Keytruda is being studied for more than 30 types of cancer in above 600 studies including excess of 400 combination trials. Merck is collaborating with several companies including Amgen, Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report), Incyte, Glaxo and Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report), separately for the evaluation of Keytruda in combination with other regimens. Data from several programs on Keytruda were presented at medical conferences in 2017.We expect Merck to present data from several key Keytruda studies this year including a combination study with Incyte’s epacadostat in first-line metastatic melanoma. Also, Keytruda could get an approval for the relapsed or refractory primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma indication this year with FDA action expected in April.ConclusionMerck did witness some setbacks regarding Keytruda’s pipeline program in 2017. In October, the company announced a delay in the readout from an important lung cancer study and postponed it to 2019. This was due to the inclusion of overall survival as a co-primary endpoint in the KEYNOTE-189 phase III study of Keytruda in first-line lung cancer. This in turn raised investor concern as the delay in the readout can give competitors a chance to gain traction in the lung cancer market.Also, three combination studies of Keytruda on multiple myeloma were put on clinical hold, following reports of death in Keytruda groups last July.Also Merck’s top line has been lately hurt by a generic competition from several drugs and pricing pressure. We believe, Keytruda has immense commercial potential and coupled with some other newer drugs, can ease the impact of genericization. Although rivalry in the immuno-oncology market has risen following FDA approval of newer oncology treatments like Pfizer’s Bavencio (avelumab) for Merkel-cell carcinoma (MCC) and bladder cancer indications and AstraZeneca’s Imfinzi (durvalumab) for bladder cancer, we believe that Keytruda can give these drugs a tough run for money as there is ample scope for growth in the immuno-oncology space.Merck carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1075,LLY,"Quite a few pharmaceutical industry mergers – including some large deals - may be in the cards in 2018 now that the tax reforms are in place. The tax bill was signed into law by U.S. President Donald Trump in December last yearThe tax rate for corporates will now go down from 35% to 21%, which can boost profits of large drug/biotech companies. Meanwhile, the change in tax code will also allow companies to bring back huge cash held overseas at a one-time tax rate of 10%. Also the tax cuts are expected to prevent inversions, which were rampant in the drug industry.These changes should definitely leave more cash in the hands of drug/biotech companies. The cash can be invested for mergers/acquisitions, which have been few in 2017 compared to 2016.Gilead’s (GILD  -  Free Report) nearly $12 billion acquisition of Kite Pharma and Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) $30 billion acquisition of Swiss biotech Actelion were the only two noteworthy deals of 2017.This week, senior executives from some of the largest pharmaceutical/biotech companies discussed the impact of tax reform on mergers and acquisition and their plans to use the excess cash at the JP Morgan HealthCare conference.What the CEOs Said?Brent Saunders, chief executive officer (CEO) of Allergan (AGN  -  Free Report) said that the first half of the year is likely to see smaller deals such as the one by Celgene (CELG  -  Free Report) while the bigger high profile mergers of large pharmaceuticals/biotech companies would probably happen in the latter half of the year or next year.Last week, Celgene announced that it has offered to buy a small cancer drug developer, Impact Biomedicines. (Read More: Celgene to Acquire Impact Biomedicines to Boost Pipeline).Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) CEO Dave Ricks and J&J’s Chief Financial Officer, Dominic Caruso said that with the tax cuts, American companies can compete better with their foreign counterparts, which operate in better tax environments. Caruso said the new tax law provides “more flexibility and ease of analysis in terms of getting a transaction done”.Along the same lines, Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) CEO, Meg Tirrell, said that having access to overseas cash will give it more financial flexibility to “think about different ways to go about the M&A transactions”. Tirrell, however, confidently said that even before the new tax law was implemented, the company had “enough power in their balance sheet” to make the bolt-on acquisitions it wanted to do.Michel Vounatsos, Biogen's (BIIB  -  Free Report) CEO, smartly argued that though the tax overhaul may spur some M&A activity, the rationale behind any M&A activity should not be the cash available. He went on to say that they are looking at “all sets of potential targets”.Gilead CEO, John Milligan, said that the tax reform is good for the company as it “allows to plan for the long term” since the FDA approval process is quite lengthy. Meanwhile, it maintained its goal of investing in M&A to replenish the pipeline. He also said that the excess cash will allow it to clean up its balance sheet by repaying debt.Conclusion Overall, it is quite clear that the drug industry is optimistic that the tax reform will fuel greater M&A activity in 2018.As it is, major drug/biotech players struggling with organic growth need an infusion of new growth drivers in their pipeline/product portfolios — either from internal development or from buyouts. Strategic M&A and licensing deals are therefore inevitable for innovation starved drug/biotech companies looking for growth in a highly competitive and global marketplace.Given that it takes several years and millions of dollars to develop new therapeutics from scratch, large pharmaceutical companies sitting on huge piles of cash may prefer to buy innovative small/mid cap biotech companies to build out their pipelines. What matters for companies looking to buy a drug/biotech stock is the current sales performance of the latter’s drugs/products, prospects of sales growth, and the quality of the pipeline.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.Click for details >>

1076,LLY,"AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) announced that its investigational oral JAK-1 selective inhibitor, upadacitinib, met the primary endpoints in a phase III study from its SELECT program, which evaluated the candidate for the treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (“RA”).AbbVie’s shares have outperformed the industry so far this year. The stock has surged 55.5% compared with the industry’s 16.1% rally.The phase III study — SELECT-MONOTHERAPY — evaluated upadacitinib monotherapy in moderate to severe RA patients who were not responsive to methotrexate for a period of 14-weeks. Both the once daily doses, 15 mg and 30 mg, evaluated in the study demonstrated superiority in ACR20 response and low disease activity (LDA) compared to methotrexate.The ACR20 response was achieved in 68% of the patients receiving 15 mg dose while the response rate was 71% for the 30 mg dose versus 41% for methotrexate. The LDA was achieved in 41%, 28% and 8% of patients receiving 30 mg, 15 mg or methotrexate, respectively.Upadacitinib is being evaluated in a large program, which includes six studies on RA patients. AbbVie is also developing the candidate in psoriatic arthritis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, ankylosing spondylitis and atopic dermatitis.The candidate has also met endpoints in two phase III studies from the SELECT program. The SELECT-MONOTHERAPY study supported the potential of the candidate in treating RA patients without a background methotrexate therapy.Successful development of upadacitinib will boost AbbVie’s RA portfolio, which already includes the blockbuster drug, Humira. Sales of Humira ($13.5 billion) accounted for 66% of net revenues in the first nine months of 2017.The approval of Incyte Corporation (INCY  -  Free Report) / Eli Lilly and Company’s (LLY  -  Free Report) Olumiant in Europe in February 2017 has not had any significant impact on Humira’s sales, as it is approved in patients who are unresponsive to TNF inhibitors like Humira. Moreover, Olumiant’s new drug application received a complete response letter from the FDA in April this year. Meanwhile, upadacitinib may be in direct line of competition with Olumiant as both are JAK-inhibitors.AbbVie Inc. Price AbbVie Inc. Price | AbbVie Inc.

1077,LLY,"Array BioPharma Inc.'s (ARRY  -  Free Report) shares increased more than 15% on Feb 6 after it announced encouraging overall survival (OS) data from a pivotal phase III study evaluating COMBO450, a combination medicine of binimetinib and encorafenib. Array along with partner Pierre Fabre have developed the combo therapy for treating patients with BRAF-mutant advanced, unresectable or metastatic melanoma.Notably, this combined regime is under review in both the United States and the EU for the aforementioned indication. A response from the FDA is expected on Jun 30, 2018. It was accepted for review based on encouraging progression-free survival data from the phase III study reported in September 2016.Array’s shares have outperformed the industry in a year’s time. The stock has soared 54.6% compared with the industry’s increase of 0.2% in the same time frame. The phase III COLUMBUS study is designed to examine the efficacy and safety of the combination therapy compared with Roche Holding AG's (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Zelboraf (vemurafenib) alone on BRAF-mutant melanoma patients. Data from the trial demonstrated a median OS of 33.6 months for patients treated with COMBO450 in comparison to 16.9 months for patients treated with vemurafenib as a monotherapy. This OS finding complements the median progression-free survival and overall response rate results, reported previously.This combination cure was generally well tolerated during the study, which is in line with the outcomes reported earlier.Array at present also evaluates encorafenib in collaboration with Eli Lilly and Company’s (LLY  -  Free Report) Erbitux (cetuximab) with or without binimetinib in the phase III BEACON CRC program on patients with BRAF V600E-mutant colorectal cancer. This study is being performed under a Special Protocol Assessment by the FDA. Patient enrollment for the same is awaited be completed in 2018.We remind investors that Array had regained development and commercialization rights to binimetinib from Novartis Pharma AG (NVS  -  Free Report) back in March 2015.It is important to note that French pharmaceutical company, Pierre Fabre Medicament SAS holds the right to commercialize binimetinib and encorafenib in Europe, Asia and Latin America. Whereas Array retains exclusive rights to commercialize both the drugs in the key markets namely the United States, Canada and Israel. Again, Ono Pharmaceutical, possesses exclusive rights to the products across Japan and South Korea.Per the press release, around 200,000 new cases of melanoma are diagnosed each year, globally. Of this, approximately 50% has BRAF mutations, a key target in treating metastatic melanoma. Hence, approval of this combo therapy is likely to provide the company with access to a potentially strong and huge market.In a separate press release, the company also announced its earnings of second-quarter fiscal 2018, reporting a loss of 17 cents per share, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 23 cents.The company reported revenues of $42.2 million, down 5.2% year over year. However, the top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $25 million. Both the releases drove the company's shares together.Array BioPharma Inc. Price Array BioPharma Inc.

1078,LLY,"2017 turned out to be a notable year for the pharma and biotech industry with the FDA giving its nod to 46 novel drugs as well as several biological license applications (“BLA”) including for path-breaking cancer treatments like Kymriah and Yescarta. This number compares favorably not only to 2016 when just 22 novel drugs were approved, but to earlier years as well. A look at the chart below shows that the highest number of approvals recorded since 1993 was in 1996 when 53 novel drugs were approved.According to the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (“CDER”), a higher number of new applications were submitted in 2017 compared to five year averages. As of Nov 30, 2017, all regulatory applications that were approved in 2017 met their PDUFA goal dates with quite a few approvals coming ahead of the FDA action date. About 88% of these drugs were approved in the first review cycle with 70% being approved under priority review status. As of Nov 30, 2017, the approval action rate was 82%.Many of the drugs approved in 2017 had also gained Breakthrough Therapy designation – while 17 breakthrough therapies were approved last year (as of Nov 30, 2017), since inception, 192 Breakthrough Therapy designations have been granted by the CDER out of a total of 529 requests (as of Nov 30, 2017). A major part of the Breakthrough Therapy requests are for cancer drugs followed by hematology and antiviral.Landmark decisions last year include the approval of a couple of gene-based therapies for cancer – Novartis’s (NVS  -  Free Report) Kymriah and Gilead Sciences’s (GILD  -  Free Report) Yescarta. These therapies have the potential to change the way we look at cancer treatments.Other key approvals included Lilly’s (LLY  -  Free Report) Verzenio (advanced or metastatic breast cancer), Gilead’s Vosevi (hepatitis C virus), Puma’s Nerlynx (to reduce the risk of breast cancer returning), J&J’s Tremfya (moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis), Regeneron (REGN  -  Free Report)/Sanofi’s Kevzara (rheumatoid arthritis), Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) multiple sclerosis treatment, Ocrevus, Regeneron and Sanofi’s eczema treatment, Dupixent, Tesaro’s PARP inhibitor, Zejula, and BioMarin’s Brineura (treatment of a specific form of Batten disease) among others. Many of these drugs have blockbuster potential.What’s in Store for 2018?The FDA intends to continue working on the recruitment and hiring of new drugs program staff. The agency will also work on the continued implementation of new PDUFA VI and BsUFA II agreements, other aspects of the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017 (“FDARA”) and the 21st Century Cures Act. The 21st Century Cures Act is expected to encourage more innovation in the sector and, maybe, a surge in new drug approvals.With the drug development process being lengthy and time-consuming and requiring the utilization of a lot of funds and resources, key pipeline events including data readouts and regulatory updates are of paramount importance and could act as major catalysts. Some of the key drugs currently under FDA review with decisions expected in the coming months include Amgen’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) investigational migraine drug, Aimovig (target action date of May 17, 2018), Dova Pharmaceuticals’s avatrombopag, and GW Pharmaceuticals’s (GWPH  -  Free Report) Epidiolex (cannabidiol or CBD), an investigational treatment for seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (“LGS”) and Dravet syndrome. Epidiolex is currently under priority review for these two rare and difficult to treat conditions of childhood-onset epilepsy with a response from the FDA expected on Jun 27, 2018. Dova’s avatrombopag is also under priority review for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in patients with chronic liver disease (“CLD”) who are scheduled to undergo a procedure – a response from the regulatory body is expected on May 21, 2018.Amgen is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock - you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Zacks’ Best Private Investment IdeasWhile we are happy to share many articles like this on the website, our best recommendations and most in-depth research are not available to the public.Starting today, for the next month, you can follow all Zacks' private buys and sells in real time.

1079,LLY,"Radius Health, Inc. (RDUS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Mar 1.  Radius Health’s shares have lost 7.9% over a year compared with the industry’s 0.9 % slip.Radius Health has a disappointing track record. The company has reported wider-than-expected loss in the trailing four trailing quarters with an average negative earnings surprise of 8.37%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this quarter. Radius Health, Inc. Price and Consensus  Radius Health, Inc. Price and Consensus | Radius Health, Inc. Quote Factors at Play?>Radius Health develops therapeutics for the treatment of osteoporosis, oncology and endocrine diseases.The company’s lead drug, Tymlos, was approved in the United States in April 2017. The drug was approved for treating postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture, defined as history of osteoporotic fracture and multiple risk factors for fracture. The drug can also be used for patients who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapies.The company reported sales of Tymlos (abaloparatide) of $3.5 million in third-quarter 2017.Hence, we expect investors to focus on the uptake of the drug during the upcoming earnings call.Although the osteoporosis market in the United States has great potential as approximately 1.4 million postmenopausal women experience osteoporotic fractures each year, Tymlos is expected to face significant competition from Eli Lilly &Co's (LLY  -  Free Report) Forteo and Amgen’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) Prolia.Meanwhile, the company’s Marketing Authorisation Application for Eladynos (abaloparatide-SC) in Europe for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis was under review.  However, in December 2017, Radius Health announced that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”) will issue a third Day-180 List of Outstanding Issues in its regulatory review of abaloparatide-SC. The CHMP informed the company that it will refer the marketing authorisation application to a scientific advisory group for additional advice as part of its ongoing risk-benefit assessment. Hence, the CHMP expects to give an opinion on the same during the first half of 2018. In July 2017, the CHMP provided a second Day-180 List of Outstanding Issues and requested additional data analyses related to the safety and efficacy of abaloparatide-SC for their ongoing regulatory review. The delay in approval in Europe is disappointing given the potential the market holds.Meanwhile, the FDA granted Fast Track designation to pipeline candidate elacestrant, an experimental selective estrogen receptor down-regulator/degrader for the treatment of women with ER+ and HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer. The elacestrant clinical development program is currently ongoing with two phase I studies in patients with ER+, HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer who have been heavily pre-treated (median of three prior lines of therapy) and have evaluable disease.  In December 2017, Radius Health provided encouraging data from the phase I 005 clinical study of elacestrant (RAD1901) in patients with estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer at the 2017 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium.Approximately 40 patients were treated at the 400 mg dose in the elacestrant phase I dose escalation and expansion cohorts. Of the enrolled patients, 22 patients met the RECIST measurable disease criteria at baseline and there were six confirmed partial responses in this group. Elacestrant was well tolerated with the most common adverse events being low grade nausea, dyspepsia and vomiting. Consequently, Radius Health plans to initiate a phase II study of elacestrant monotherapy, a potentially pivotal study, for women suffering from advanced or metastatic ER+/HER2- breast cancer early in 2018. Hence, we expect the management to throw light on pipeline progress.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Radius Health is likely to beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for Radius Health is currently pegged at -1.22%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at a loss of $1.50 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at a loss of $1.48.

Although the rank is favorable, the company’s negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult. Note that we caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stock to ConsiderHere is a pharma company that you may consider, as our model shows that it has the right combination of elements to deliver an earnings beat this quarter.Gemphire Therapeutics (GEMP  -  Free Report) is expected to release fourth-quarter results on Mar 21.

1080,LLY,"United Therapeutics Corporation (UTHR  -  Free Report) reported adjusted earnings of $3.89 per share in the fourth quarter of 2017, which declined 4.2% from the year-ago quarter due to higher operating costs. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was pegged at $1.94 per share.Adjusted earnings excluded the impact of share-based compensation expenses and the impact of tax reforms.Revenues for the reported quarter were $465 million, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $416 million. Revenues also grew 13.6% year over year. Stronger sales across the PAH franchise pulled up the top line in the quarter.The Quarter in DetailUnited Therapeutics markets four products for the treatment of PAH – Remodulin, Tyvaso, Adcirca and Orenitram. Please note that United Therapeutics bought exclusive rights to commercialize Adcirca for the treatment of PAH in the United States from Eli Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) in November 2008.Adcirca sales were $119.3 million, up 5.9% year over year. Orenitram sales amounted to $48 million in the quarter, up 25.3% year over year due to patient growth. Remodulin sales were $180.1 million, up 19.1% year over year. Tyvaso sales totaled 92.4 million, down 1.3% year over year. Sales of Tyvaso, however, improved sequentially in the quarter. Unituxin’s (for the treatment of pediatric patients with high-risk neuroblastoma) sales of $24.9 million surged 88.6% year over year.Research and development (R&D) expenses escalated 96.4% to $91.5 million due to higher costs to support the company’s pipeline of cardiopulmonary and cancer drugs and to develop its organ manufacturing projects. On the conference call, the company said that R&D costs will continue to rise in 2018 to advance the company’s expanding pipeline.Shares of United Therapeutics were down almost 10% on Wednesday, probably as management hinted at potentially higher costs for 2018. In fact, the stock has underperformed the industry in the past year, having declined 16.8% while the industry has increased 0.5% during the period.Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses rose 8.8% to $69 million.Pipeline Update United Therapeutics is working on expanded indications for some of its marketed products like Orenitram and Tyvaso. The company, at present, has seven phase III programs in the fields of cardiopulmonary diseases and oncology. A phase IV FREEDOM-EV study is evaluating an oral combination therapy of Orenitram –OreniPlus. Full data from this study is expected this year. Meanwhile a phase III BEAT study is evaluating Tysuberprost - esuberaprost in combination with Tyvaso. United Therapeutics has also begun clinical development of dinutuximab, the active ingredient in Unituxin, for small cell lung cancer (phase II/III DISTINCT study) and other high-risk forms of cancer with GD2 expressing cell tumors such as ovarian cancer and several sarcomas.United Therapeutics is also working on new delivery mechanisms for Remodulin. The company is working with Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report) to get RemoSynch, an implantable pump for delivering Remodulin intravenously, approved by the FDA. United Therapeutics expects to launch the RemoSynch system this year. United Therapeutics is also working with DEKA for the development of a pre-filled, semi-disposable pump system for subcutaneous delivery of Remodulin (RemUnity). Clinical studies on RemoPro, a pain-free new chemical entity version of treprostinil, are expected to begin this year.Several data read-outs and regulatory updates are expected in 2018.Patent SettlementsLast week, United Therapeutics announced settlement of its ongoing patent litigation with Actavis Laboratories, a subsidiary of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA  -  Free Report), related to Orenitram. Actavis is looking to bring a generic version of Orenitram. Per the settlement deal, Actavis can launch a generic version of Orenitram after Jun 15, 2027.However, investors should remember that Remodulin and Adcirca could start facing generic competition by middle of the year.United Therapeutics carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

We also see better-than-expected results from ADP’s (ADP  -  Free Report) monthly private sector payroll report.In fact, the 234K new jobs created for January was well ahead of the 180K anticipated, and although December’s results were revised downward by 8000 jobs, it still tallied 242K. This is outstanding jobs growth over the past two months, especially considering we have been near peak employment for quite some time now. Services led the way with 212K new jobs, with Manufacturing adding 12K and Construction +9K.Non-farm payroll figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) on Friday morning should be very interesting in light of today’s results. One thing analysts will certainly be looking at - aside from the Unemployment rate, which is expected to dip to 4.0%  - with be Average Hourly Wage Growth. With a jobs market this tight, it would stand to reason employees will start to see a rise in their take-home pay. The proof, as they say, will be in the pudding.Q4 Earnings on a RollEven before the strong ADP report came out this morning, the Dow was already trading in the pre-market up more than 200 points - not quite erasing the losses from earlier this week, but definitely helping fill the hole. A big part of this came from a huge earnings report home run from Boeing (BA  -  Free Report).The airplane-making giant brought in $4.80 per share in its Q4 earnings report, far ahead of the $2.91 per share expected in the Zacks consensus estimate. Revenues of $25.78 billion trounced the $24.83 billion analysts were looking for. Backlog was up compared to a year ago for the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company, but guidance was also sharply raised for full-year 2018 compared to expectations. As a result, shares shot up 3.6% initially and are approaching +6% at this hour in the pre-market.

Guidance was also upped for full-year to $4.81-4.91 per share, while revenue guidance stayed pat for now.

1082,LLY,"Although there are still a few days left for the year to end, 2017 has turned out to be pretty good for the pharma and biotech sector where FDA approvals are concerned. Till date, the regulatory agency has given its nod to 43 novel drugs, well above the 22 drugs approved last year. Immuno-oncology was a key focus area in 2017, whether it was to do with scientific conferences, clinical trial collaborations, acquisitions or FDA approvals.The approval of Novartis’s (NVS  -  Free Report) Kymriah, a gene cell therapy, and Gilead’s (GILD  -  Free Report) Yescarta, a CAR-T (chimeric antigen receptor T cells) cell treatment, ensured that the highly lucrative immuno-oncology market remained in the limelight.The $11.9 billion acquisition of immuno-oncology focused Kite by Gilead also increased interest in this category with investors expecting more acquisition announcements in this area.While we see 2017 as a year focused on immuno-oncology, here is a look at three therapeutic areas that we think will garner a lot of interest in 2018.Immuno-OncologyImmuno-oncology will remain a key focus area in 2018 as well. The basic concept of cancer immunotherapy or immuno-oncology is to utilize certain parts of the immune system to fight the disease. This can be done by stimulating the immune system to attack cancer cells or by introducing immune system components into the body. While some immuno-oncology treatments have the potential to be effective as monotherapies, others may be more effective when combined with other treatments.Different types of immunotherapies include monoclonal antibodies/mAbs (man-made versions of immune system proteins which can be designed to attack a very specific part of a cancer cell), immune checkpoint inhibitors (recognize and attack cancer cells), vaccines (help prevent or treat cancer) and others that boost the overall immune system.Encouraging results generated by some companies demonstrating partial and complete responses in late-stage cancer patients and the recent FDA approval of Kymriah and Yescarta has raised hopes for cancer patients and increased interest in this segment of the cancer market. With immuno-oncology set to change the treatment paradigm for cancer, this area represents huge commercial potential.Companies that have progressed quite a bit in this area include Juno Therapeutics , Incyte and bluebird bio (BLUE  -  Free Report) with these companies often considered to be acquisition targets.Alzheimer’s DiseaseAlzheimer’s disease is an area where many companies have tried their luck though not with much success. Over the last several years, big players like Merck, Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report), Pfizer and J&J have all faced setbacks in their quest to find a treatment for Alzheimer’s.Companies that are currently working on Alzheimer’s disease treatments include players like Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report), Novartis, AstraZeneca, Eisai and Amgen.Biogen’s aducanumab is one of the most important candidates in the company’s pipeline with the candidate currently in a couple of late-stage studies. Biogen is also working on elenbecestat (E2609), a BACE inhibitor in a phase III program and BAN2401, a humanized beta amyloid antibody in phase II development with top-line results expected by the end of January 2018. All three candidates are being developed in collaboration with Eisai.  Lilly also has quite a few Alzheimer’s disease candidates in its pipeline including lanabecestat, which is being developed in collaboration with AstraZeneca with data readout expected in 2019. Meanwhile, Novartis and Amgen are collaborating for BACE1 inhibitor CNP520 which has fast track status in the United Status. Roche is also collaborating with AC Immune for the development of Alzheimer’s disease treatments.Although Alzheimer’s has historically been a very challenging therapeutic area with quite a few stocks stumbling in their efforts to find a treatment, the market is highly lucrative. As a result, several companies continue to invest heavily in developing Alzheimer’s disease treatments. According to the Alzheimer's Association, in the 10 years from 2002-2012, 244 drugs were tested for Alzheimer’s in studies registered with clinicaltrials.gov out of which only one succeeded and went on to gain FDA approval.While these numbers are far from encouraging, success in this area means huge returns considering more than five million Americans are living with Alzheimer’s disease with the numbers expected to increase to as much as 16 million by 2050 (Data: Alzheimer's Association). It is considered to be one of the biggest burdens of society and is the sixth leading cause of death across all ages in the United States. The market has immense commercial potential and companies coming out with new treatments could rake in billions of dollars in sales.Medical MarijuanaAnother segment of the pharma and biotech industry that will remain in the limelight next year is the medical marijuana industry. The industry got its first exchange traded fund (“ETF”) earlier this year and has been attracting interest from investors over the last few quarters. The industry is expected to grow rapidly with legislators allowing or looking to allow more legal uses of marijuana and marijuana-related products, especially in the medical and life sciences industry.Some of the key players in this area include GW Pharmaceuticals plc (GWPH  -  Free Report), INSYS Therapeutics, Corbus Pharmaceuticals Holdings and Zynerba Pharmaceuticals.GW Pharma commercialized the world's first plant-derived cannabinoid prescription drug, Sativex, which is approved for the treatment of spasticity due to multiple sclerosis. However, the company has been in the news for its lead cannabinoid pipeline candidate, Epidiolex (cannabidiol or CBD), which is in development for a number of rare childhood-onset epilepsy disorders. The company is currently seeking FDA approval for Epidiolex for Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome – approval could come as early as mid-2018 if priority review is granted. Epidiolex represents blockbuster potential especially if it is approved across all possible indications. GW Pharma has several new formulations of CBD in development including improved liquid formulations, a solid dose form and an intravenous formulation.Specialty pharma company, INSYS, uses its proprietary spray technology and capabilities for the development of pharmaceutical cannabinoids for a wide range of indication including treating addiction to opioids, opioid overdose, epilepsy, and other disease areas with significant unmet need.

1083,LLY,"Indianapolis, IN based Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report), is a global healthcare company with core products in a number of primary-care pharmaceutical markets. Lilly generates revenues from its pharmaceutical product and animal health segments.The company’s portfolio includes Zyprexa (schizophrenia and bipolar disorder), Humalog (diabetes), Evista (osteoporosis), Cymbalta (depression), Cialis (erectile dysfunction), Strattera (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder - ADHD), Erbitux (cancer) and Alimta (chemotherapy). Lilly also has a strong presence in the diabetes market. However, many of its key products like Cymbalta and Alimta are facing generic competition. The company also has some new products like Trulicity, Cyramza, Jardiance, Basaglar, Lartruvo and Taltz in its portfolio which are driving revenues.Lilly’s earnings performance has been mixed with earnings beating expectations in three of the last four quarters while missing the same in one, bringing the average negative surprise to 1.68%.Currently, Lilly has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), but that could definitely change following the company’s earnings report which was just released.

1084,LLY,"The FDA has proposed new guidelines, which are aimed at lowering the clinical study goals of Alzheimer’s disease drugs for treating earlier-stage patients who have not yet displayed functional disability or clinical abnormality. This strategy, part of FDA’s ongoing efforts to expand access to safe and effective treatment options for many serious conditions, suggests that the agency may be open to an accelerated approval process for such drugs.FDA’s proposed guidelines came in a week when major disappointments in the field were announced by companies developing drugs to treat this deadly brain disease.Earlier this week, Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) announced that it is discontinuing another study evaluating verubecestat for the treatment of prodromal Alzheimer’s disease as its success was unlikely.Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report) also announced that it has decided to increase the number of patients (enrolment) in studies being conducted on its crucial Alzheimer’s disease candidate, aducanumab, which raised concerns regarding the chances of success of the treatment. In December 2017, Biogen’s Alzheimer’s disease study on another candidate, BAN2401 failed to show early positive results, which raised investor concern about the candidate’s chances of success.The Alzheimer’s disease market has attracted a lot of attention from several companies. However, the successful development of therapies for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease is challenging.This may be somewhat because the underlying causes of severe neurological ailments like Alzheimer’s may not be as clear as diseases like cancer. Also, Alzheimer’s  progress may go unnoticed for years. By the time, the symptoms of the ailment become evident, significant function may already be lost, which makes developing drugs to treat this disease difficult.We note that several companies have failed in this regard.Last month, Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) reportedly announced the termination of its R&D efforts in the Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease areas, which will result in about 300 layoffs. Long back, Pfizer shelved its late-stage Alzheimer’s candidate, bapineuzumab IV after it failed two phase III studies.In November 2016, Lilly’s (LLY  -  Free Report) anti-amyloid candidate solanezumab failed to meet the primary endpoint in a late-stage AD study. Lilly decided to drop the development of solanezumab. Lilly also suffered a major setback in August 2010, when it had to halt the development of another phase III Alzheimer’s candidate, semagacestat.The Alzheimer’s disease market represents huge commercial potential and a successfully developed product could generate billions of dollars in sales once launched.FDA’s latest effort may reinvigorate research efforts for Alzheimer’s drugs after repeated failures.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

1085,LLY,"Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) announced positive top-line data from a phase III label expansion study evaluating its psoriasis drug, Taltz (ixekizumab), in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (“AS”). The drug met the primary endpoint of improvement in the signs and symptoms of AS and all secondary endpoints as well.Taltz, an IL-17A antagonist, is currently approved for the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis or active psoriatic arthritis (PsA).Shares of the company are down 3.3% in the past year, underperforming the industry’s gain of 11.2% in that period.  The phase III study – COAST-V – evaluated the drug in AS patients who have not received any prior treatment with a biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug. The study consisted of a placebo arm and an active control arm with AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) arthritis drug, Humira. Data from the study showed that treatment with Taltz led to statistically significant improvement as measured by the proportion of patients who achieved Assessment of Spondyloarthritis International Society 40 at 16 weeks.Additional data from the study is expected to be presented later this year.Ankylosing spondylitis is a type of spondyloarthritis affecting pelvic joints and spine. It is characterized by chronic inflammatory back pain, stiffness and impaired function and mobility.Taltz sales increased 14% quarter over quarter in the last quarter of 2017, on the back of strong uptake. In January 2018, the drug received approval in Europe for PsA, which is expected to boost sales of the drug in the first quarter of 2018.However, several drugs are approved for the treatment of AS including Humira and Novartis’ (NVS  -  Free Report) Cosentyx. Other companies are developing their therapies for treating AS, which includes Galapagos’ (GLPG  -  Free Report) filgotinib. Eli Lilly and Company Price  Eli Lilly and Company Price | Eli Lilly and Company Quote Zacks RankLilly carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Don’t Even Think About Buying Bitcoin Until You Read ThisThe most popular cryptocurrency skyrocketed last year, giving some investors the chance to bank 20X returns or even more.

1086,LLY,"Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) reportedly said in a statement that it will end R&D efforts in the Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease areas, which will result in about 300 layoffs.The decision to end the neuroscience-discovery program will mainly affect employees at facilities in Andover and Cambridge,  MA, and Groton,  CT. Pfizer, however, intends to continue development of pain candidate, tanezumab, which it is developing in late-stage studies in partnership with Eli Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report), label expansion efforts for pain drug Lyrica and its rare disease program.Shares of Pfizer have risen 10.2% in the past year, comparing unfavorably with a 16.5% increase for the industry.The successful development of therapies for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease is challenging and we note that several companies have failed in this regard.In fact Pfizer itself shelved its late-stage Alzheimer’s candidate, bapineuzumab IV after it failed two phase III studies. Pfizer was developing the candidate in collaboration with Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) and Elan Corporation.In November 2016, Lilly’s anti-amyloid candidate solanezumab failed to meet the primary endpoint in a late-stage AD study.

1087,LLY,"The Alzheimer’s disease (“AD”) area is in focus once again with Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) saying that it will be dropping its plans to develop treatments for Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease. According to news sources, Pfizer expects its decision to result in the elimination of 300 positions from the neuroscience discovery and early development programs. We expect additional details to be available at the company’s presentation at the 36th Annual JPMorgan Healthcare Conference today.Pfizer has had a long association with the Alzheimer’s disease research area. In 2015, the company became a part of the Dementia Discovery Fund, which was formed to speed up the development of new treatments for neurological diseases by bringing together major pharma companies, the UK government and Alzheimer’s Research UK. The Fund is involved in the financing of new, early stage drug development projects.However, Alzheimer’s has always been a highly challenging area with not much progress being made despite the investment of a lot of funds and resources. In fact, Pfizer itself had faced a major setback way back in 2012 in its development efforts for an Alzheimer’s disease treatment. The company and its partner, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report), decided to discontinue the development of bapineuzumab IV following a late-stage failure.Other companies like Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) and Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) have also stumbled in their efforts to develop treatments for Alzheimer’s. Lilly decided in November 2016 that it would not seek approval for its investigational AD treatment, solanezumab, following disappointing results from a late-stage study. The candidate was being evaluated to see whether it can slow the progression of memory problems associated with amyloid, a protein that forms plaques in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s.Meanwhile, the evaluation of Merck’s investigational Alzheimer’s disease treatment, verubecestat, was halted in a phase II/III study (EPOCH) in February 2017 based on an interim analysis by an external Data Monitoring Committee (eDMC) that the study might fail. Another study is ongoing with results expected in February 2019.Biogen also suffered a setback recently when an Independent Data Monitoring Committee said that BAN2401 did not meet the criteria for success based on a Bayesian analysis at 12 months as the primary endpoint in the phase II study. The failure to show an early positive result came as a major disappointment for Biogen which is developing the candidate in association with Eisai.Clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company Axovant Sciences (AXON  -  Free Report) suffered a major setback in September 2017 when its investigational Alzheimer’s disease candidate failed to meet the co-primary efficacy endpoints in a late-stage study. The company decided to discontinue development of the 35 mg dose for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Over the last one year, the company’s shares are down 59.7% compared to the 1.7% decline of the industry it belongs to.According to the Alzheimer's Association, in the 10 years from 2002-2012, 244 drugs were tested for Alzheimer’s in studies registered with clinicaltrials.gov out of which only one succeeded and went on to gain FDA approval.The Road AheadDespite all these setbacks, several companies continue to invest heavily in developing Alzheimer’s disease treatments given the high commercial potential in this market.

1089,LLY,"Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) announced disappointing results from a pivotal phase III KEYNOTE-061 study, evaluating its anti-PD-1 therapy, Keytruda (pembrolizumab), as a second-line treatment for patients with advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction (“GEJ”) adenocarcinoma.Notably, Keytruda is already approved in the United States as a monotherapy for third-line treatment of advanced gastric or GEJ. Additionally, it is approved for many types of cancers and treatment settings including lung cancer, melanoma, head and neck cancer, classical hodgkin lymphoma and bladder cancer.Shares of Merck has lost 4.9% this year so far compared unfavorably with the industry’s 16.5% increase.The phase III study failed to meet its primary endpoint of overall survival (OS). Notably, the progression free survival (PFS) showed no statistical significance in the PD-L1 positive patient population.However, the company said that it will continue to evaluate Keytruda in two other phase III studies, both as a monotherapy as well as in combination with chemotherapy as a first-line treatment for patients with GEJ.We remind investors that Keytruda is a key top-line driver for Merck and it brought in $1.5 billion sales in third-quarter 2017, up 18.8% sequentially and 194% year over year. Sales continue to be driven by a launch of new indications globally.Significantly, Keytruda sales in the United States have gained particularly from a strong momentum in the new indication of first-line lung cancer. The drug’s sales were primarily driven by melanoma outside the United States.Meanwhile, the Keytruda development program also significantly advanced this year with regulatory approvals for four new indications in the United States and two additional diseases in Europe.Important approvals include nods for advanced bladder cancer in both the United States and the EU, advanced microsatellite instability-high cancers and the first sanction for a combination therapy with Eli Lilly & Company’s (LLY  -  Free Report) cancer drug Alimta (pemetrexed) and carboplatin (pem/carbo), a commonly used chemo regimen in lung cancer.Keytruda is continuously growing and expanding into new indications and markets globally. It is under trial for more than 30 types of cancer in above 650 studies including excess of 300 combination studies.Merck is collaborating separately with several companies namely Amgen, Inc.

Roche also presented data on a Tecentriq-Avastin combination in certain people with advanced kidney cancer (Read more: Roche Reports Positive Data from Tecentriq Combination Study) and a Venclexta/Venclyxto - MabThera/Rituxan combination in previously treated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (Read more: Roche/AbbVie Report Positive Phase III Results on Venclexta).Bristol-Myers was also present at ASH with data on Sprycel (dasatinib), which when added to standard chemotherapy showed a three-year survival benefit in pediatric patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Read more: Bristol-Myers Reports Positive Data on Leukemia Drug).The company and partner Seattle Genetics also presented interim results from a phase I/II study on a combination of Adcetris and Opdivo in relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma. Combination data showed an objective response rate of 83% and a complete response rate of 62%.Lilly Provides 2018 Outlook: Lilly provided its outlook for 2018 saying that it expects recently launched products like Trulicity, Taltz, Basaglar, Jardiance, Verzenio, Cyramza, Olumiant and Lartruvo to drive low-single-digit revenue growth. The company expects 2018 earnings per share of $4.60 - $4.70 on revenues of $23 - $23.5 billion. However, challenges remain for the company in the form of loss of patent exclusivity for products like Cialis and the impact of generic competition for Strattera, Effient and Axiron. U.S. pricing access pressure will also remain a headwind in 2018.Meanwhile, the company continues to expect 2017 earnings of $4.15 to $4.25 per share on revenues of $22.4 - $22.7 billion. Lilly raised its quarterly dividend by 8% as well. The company also reaffirmed its guidance of average annual revenue growth of at least 5% from 2015 to 2020 and said that it expects operating margin of at least 30% in 2020.On the pipeline front, Lilly expects regulatory action in the United States for baricitinib (treatment of rheumatoid arthritis), galcanezumab (migraine treatment) and a new indication for Verzenio (breast cancer), and the launch of a new indication for Taltz in psoriatic arthritis in 2018 (Read more: Lilly Issues Guidance for 2018, New Drugs to Drive Top Line). The stock has gained 17.6% year to date, compared to the 17.7% rally of the industry it belongs to.Teva Shares Up on Restructuring Plan: After weeks of speculation that Teva will be cutting down its workforce, the company announced a restructuring plan that will see about 14,000 job cuts (more than 25% of the company’s global workforce) over the next two years with the majority expected in 2018.The new CEO’s goal is to reduce the cost base, simplify the organization and improve business performance, profitability, cash flow generation and productivity. The company expects to cut $3 billion from its $16.1 billion cost base (estimated for 2017) by the end of 2019. The plan also calls for the optimization of the global generics portfolio, especially in the United States, through price adjustments and/or product discontinuation.Several manufacturing plants in the United States, Europe, Israel and Growth Markets as well as R&D facilities, headquarters and other office locations across all geographies will be shut down or divested. As far as the pipeline is concerned, all R&D programs will be reviewed so that core projects can be identified while other projects are terminated immediately.The company also suspended dividend payments and annual bonus and said it will continue to look for opportunities to divest non-core assets.These steps come at a time when Teva is facing several challenges - the company has significant financial obligations in the coming four years while the environment remains challenging in the company’s largest generic market (the United States). Teva also expects fewer generic product launches in the United States.Teva’s shares were up 10.2% on the restructuring announcement as investors cheered the steps taken by the company though execution remains key.  Priority Review for Bristol-Myers’s Opdivo-Yervoy Combination: The FDA has granted priority review to Bristol-Myers’s supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for the label expansion of Opdivo for use in combination with Yervoy for the treatment of intermediate- and poor-risk patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (“RCC”). With the regulatory agency granting priority review, a response should be out on Apr 16, 2018.R&D Updates from Sanofi: Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report) provided an update on its pipeline (71 R&D projects including 37 new molecular entities and novel vaccines) at an analyst meeting this week. The company said that it expects to start at least 10 late-stage studies in 2018. At least 10 pivotal phase III studies are expected to start over the next 12 months. During this period, Sanofi expects to file for regulatory approval of two investigational cancer drugs (cemiplimab and isatuximab), a type I diabetes treatment (sotagliflozin) and a potential treatment for uncontrolled, persistent asthma (dupilumab).In fact, Sanofi and partner Regeneron announced positive topline results from a pivotal mid-stage study on cemiplimab in 82 patients with advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (“CSCC”), the second deadliest skin cancer after melanoma. Overall response rate (“ORR”) of 46.3% was observed in the study. The companies have started submitting a rolling Biologics License Application (“BLA”) for the PD-1 antibody with the submission expected to complete in the first quarter of 2018 (Read more: Regeneron, Sanofi Report Positive Top Line Skin Cancer Data).Meanwhile, Sanofi gained FDA approval for Admelog (insulin lispro injection), a rapid-acting insulin similar to Lilly’s Humalog, for the management of blood sugar levels at mealtime. Admelog was approved in the EU earlier this year in July (Read more: Sanofi Wins FDA Approval for Biosimilar of Lilly's Humalog).Updates on Merck’s Keytruda: Merck provided a couple of updates related to its anti-PD-1 therapy, Keytruda, this week. The company said that an sBLA seeking label expansion for the use of Keytruda for the treatment of relapsed or refractory primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (“PMBCL”) has been granted priority review by the FDA. The company also presented data at ASH which showed that the use of Keytruda resulted in an overall response rate of 41% in this difficult-to-treat patient population. With the FDA granting priority review, a response from the agency should be out by Apr 3, 2018. Approval would make this the second blood cancer indication for Keytruda with the earlier indication being for use in certain patients with classical Hodgkin lymphoma (Read more: Merck's Keytruda Gets FDA Priority Review for Rare Lymphoma).However, Keytruda failed to meet the primary endpoint of overall survival in a pivotal study for the second-line treatment of patients with advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction (“GEJ”) adenocarcinoma.

1091,LLY,"Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) issued financial guidance for 2018, which was in line with market expectations. The company also re-affirmed the previously issued 2017 projection as well as its long-term expectations.Shares were up more than 1% in Wednesday. So far this year, Lilly’s share price has risen 19.5% compared with an increase of 17.7% for the industry.2018 ForecastIn 2018, adjusted earnings per share are expected to be between $4.60 and $4.70, representing growth in the range of low double digit. Revenues are expected to be between $23.0 billion and $23.5 billion, representing growth of about 3% at the mid-point of 2017 and 2018 ranges. Foreign exchange impact is expected to benefit revenues by about 90 basis points. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales and earnings is pegged at $23.07 billion and $4.66 per share, respectively.Lilly’s new products like Trulicity, Taltz, Basaglar, Cyramza, Jardiance, Verzenio and Lartruvo have been driving revenues and the trend is expected to continue in 2018. Strong uptake trends of Lilly’s new drugs have been instrumental in leading the company to increase its 2017 sales outlook twice this year.  However, competitive pressure on Lilly’s drugs is expected to rise next year. Novo Nordisk’s (NVO  -  Free Report) Ozempic/semaglutide, which received FDA approval this month, can pose strong competition to Lilly’s key new growth driver, Trulicity on launch. Meanwhile, Sanofi’s (SNY  -  Free Report) Admelog, the biosimilar version of Lilly’s blockbuster rapid-acting insulin Humalog, which also received FDA approval this month, can hurt sales of Lilly’s branded drug on launch. As it is, the company is facing loss of exclusivity on a number of its products in various markets while pricing headwinds are hurting sales of its older diabetes products.As far as its pipeline is concerned, in 2018, the company expects regulatory action on its rheumatoid arthritiscandidate, Olumiant/baricitiniband migraine preventioncandidate galcanezumab. While a new drug application (NDA) for galcanezumab already under review in the United States, a NDA for Olumiant is expected to be re-submitted in January. We remind investors that in April this year, Lilly received a complete response letter (CRL) from the FDA for Olumiant. The FDA required additional clinical data, which will delay the approval of the drug. Olumiant was approved in the EU in February. The company also expects label expansions for its newly launched breast cancer drug, Verzenio.Marketing, selling and administrative expenses are expected in the range of $6.1–$6.4 billion, while research and development expenses are projected to be $5.0–$5.2 billion. Adjusted gross margin is expected to be approximately 75%. Adjusted tax rate is expected to be approximately 21.5%.Importantly, the company mentioned that the guidance assumes no major healthcare reform in the United States and continuation of current US corporate tax system.2017 Guidance ReaffirmedLilly maintained its previously issued 2017 adjusted earnings and sales outlook for 2017. Adjusted earnings per share are expected in the range of $4.15 to $4.25. Revenues are expected in the range of $22.4 billion and $22.7 billion. Gross margin is expected to be approximately 76%. Adjusted tax rate is expected to be approximately 21%.Marketing, selling and administrative expenses are still expected in the range of $6.4–$6.6 billion, while research and development expenses are projected to be $5.1-$5.2 billion.Long-Term Targets in PlaceLilly further reiterated its annual revenue growth target of at least 5% through 2020 on a constant-currency basis backed by robust volumes. Additionally, the company expects operating margin (excluding currency impact on international inventories sold) to be at least 30%, as a percentage of revenues, in 2020.Lilly carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1092,LLY,"Shares of ImmunoGen, Inc. (IMGN  -  Free Report) have been massively up 227.5% this year so far, outperforming the industry’s 9.8% increase. Let’s analyze the factors that led to this skyrocketing rally.ImmunoGen’s rapid pipeline progress along with positive readouts and strategic collaborations has driven its share price up consistently.The company has made a significant progress regarding its lead pipeline candidate, mirvetuximab soravtansine, this year. It is being evaluated in a phase III study (FORWARD I) as a single-agent therapy for treating patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.ImmunoGenhas activated more than 90 sites for study enrolment in the third quarter this year, aiming to complete it by the middle of 2018. The readout on the primary endpoint is anticipated in the first half of 2019. Also, the candidate is being evaluated in three phase I expansion cohorts on 113 ovarian cancer patients. In May, the company reported positive data from the trial, which demonstrated a promising safety and efficacy profile of the candidate.Meanwhile, combination regimens with mirvetuximab soravtansine for ovarian cancer are also being examined in phase Ib/II FORWARD II study. The trial consists of cohorts assessing mirvetuximab soravtansine in combination with Roche's (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Avastin and Merck's (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda.In May, ImmunoGen had reported initial results from this study, showing mirvetuximab soravtansine with potential to complement the currently available therapies for the indication. Approval of any of these combo therapies will significantly expand the eligible patient population for mirvetuximab soravtansine.An FDA nod for mirvetuximab soravtansine would be a huge boost to ImmunoGen, given its immense commercial potential in the target market. Ovarian cancer causes maximum annual deaths among the gynecologic cancers with majority of patients diagnosed at an advanced stage.Per data provided by the American Cancer Society, approximately 22,440 new cases of ovarian cancer are estimated to be diagnosed across the United States alone in 2017, thereby taking the death toll to more than 14,080.Apart from mirvetuximab soravtansine, ImmunoGen is working to develop a couple of other clinical/pre-clinical candidates including IMGN779 and IMGN632. Notably, IMGN779 is being analysed in a phase I study for treating acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with encouraging data reported earlier this month. On the other hand, the company plans to move IMGN632 into a clinical development soon to address hematological malignancies including AML.The company has signed agreements with several big healthcare players including Amgen, Bayer, Eli Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report), Novartis, Roche, Sanofi and Takeda. By dint of these contracts, other companies are allowed to use ImmunoGen’s ADC technology and provide it with funds in the form of license and milestone fees, royalties, clinical materials revenues plus R&D support fees.  Notably, in August, ImmunoGen had announced a strategic collaboration and option agreement with Jazz Pharmaceuticals for development and commercialization of the two candidates under its ADC programs namely, IMGN779 and IMGN632. Pursuant to this deal, ImmunoGen would be eligible to receive milestone payments based on certain pre-decided conditions.Although the platinum-resistant ovarian cancer market offers immense commercial potential, ImmunoGen is notably set to face intense competition upon approval. However, mirvetuximab soravtansine looks promising at this juncture and its approval will be a big boost to the company.ImmunoGen, Inc. Price ImmunoGen, Inc. Price | ImmunoGen, Inc.

1093,LLY,"Intersect ENT, Inc. (XENT  -  Free Report) received approval from the FDA for SINUVA Sinus Implant. The company has been focused on developing innovative therapies for chronic sinusitis patients.SINUVA is an exclusive approach to treat recurrent nasal polyp disease in patients who have undergone ethmoid sinus surgery. Per management, approximately 635,000 Americans have gone through these surgeries and are looking for treatments to cure side effects.Intersect ENT expects SINUVA to be costlier than other products in the portfolio. However, higher price will not dent the company’s gross margins in the upcoming fourth quarter. It has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 25%.Notably, nasal polyps are inflammations along the lining of nasal passage or sinus resulting in congestion, infections and low sense of smell. SINUVA is Intersect ENT’s fourth commercial product, which is likely to be introduced to physicians across the country in the following months.Shares Shine BrightYear to date, Intersect ENT has had a solid run on the bourses, trading above the market at large.  The company returned 163.2% comparing favorably with the industry’s rally of only 23.2%. Also, the current return is higher than the S&P 500 index’s increase of 21.7% over the same time frame. The stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. Market Trends Buoy OptimismIntroduction of new technologies and rapid innovations in healthcare market are creating opportunities for companies that are striving to make profits in the sinusitis treatment market. Per a report by Persistence Market Research, the Center of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has revealed that 11.7 million people in the United States get diagnosed with chronic sinusitis on a regular basis.Considering the solid prospects of the market, we believe that Intersect ENT will gain strong market traction in the upcoming days. A few other major market players engaged in the manufacturing of treatment products for sinusitis include Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report), Abbott Laboratories (ABT  -  Free Report) and Eli Lilly And Company (LLY  -  Free Report).Our TakeIntersect ENT’s fourth-quarter operating expenses are likely to rise, thanks to the one-time expenses related to the SINUVA launch, production of demo units and costs related to market-access infrastructure.Among latest developments, PROPEL Contour is expected to be an important driver for Intersect ENT. Products like PROPEL and PROPEL mini are drug-eluting implants for patients suffering from chronic sinusitis. It offers products and therapies for ear, nose and throat surgeons to improve treatment of patients with chronic diseases.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?

1094,LLY,"The fourth-quarter 2017 earnings season is in full swing with financial figures from 133 S&P 500 members or 26% of the index already out as of Jan 26, 2018 per the latest Earnings Preview.Total earnings for these index members jumped 12.3% from the year-ago quarter, driven by 8.8% improvement in revenues. The beat ratio was 81.2% for the bottom line and 78.9% for the top line.On a positive note, the ongoing earnings phase seems to have begun well for the Drug/Biotech sector. Among major large cap players, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) kicked off the season with earnings beating estimates while sales slightly missing the same. A few other large pharma companies released their earnings results last week and the picture looks quite encouraging.The pharma bigwigs having reported last week are Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) and AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report), which surpassed both earnings and sales estimates in the quarter under review. While Novartis raised its sales guidance for 2018, AbbVie increased its previously issued earnings expectations for the year.Of the major players in the biotech sector, Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report) announced a mixed performance in the reported period with earnings lagging estimates while sales exceeding the same. However, Celgene Corp. (CELG  -  Free Report) outpaced both the metrics’ expectations during the fourth quarter.Drug/biotech stocks remained on a growth trajectory in 2017, courtesy of a slew of FDA approvals, rise in demand for new product sales, successful innovation and product line expansion, strong clinical reports as well as a continued robust performance of legacy products. Moreover, these impressive factors, along with regular acquisitions, are expected to drive the sector’s growth in 2018 as well.Also, per the Earnings Preview, the broader Medical sector (inclusive of drug, biotech as well as Medical Device companies) is likely to record 4.9% year-over-year growth in revenues and a 4.2% rise in earnings in the period under discussion.Two pharma/biotech giants are scheduled to report earnings numbers on Jan 31. Let's see how things are shaping up for the companies in the upcoming releases.Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report)Lilly is scheduled to release fourth-quarter earnings before the market opens. The company delivered a positive surprise of 1.94% last quarter. Lilly’s earnings performance has been modest with earnings missing expectations in three of the last four quarters while beating the same in the remaining one, thus bringing the average beat to 1.68%.Our proven model shows that Lilly is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. The combination of Lilly’s Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP as a solid Zacks Rank, and a positive Earnings ESP of +0.47% makes us confident about an earnings beat in the impending report. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter to be reported is pegged at $1.08 per share.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.We expect a sturdy uptake of new products like Trulicity, Taltz, Basaglar, Cyramza, Jardiance and Lartruvo. This upside is likely to make up for the decline in sales of established products like Zyprexa, Alimta, Cialis, Strattera and Effient in the fourth quarter. (Read More: Lilly to Report Q4 Earnings: What's in the Cards?).Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (VRTX  -  Free Report)Vertex is slated to release fourth-quarter earnings after the market closes. The company’s track record has also been impressive so far. It delivered a positive surprise in each of the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 32.67%. In third-quarter 2017, Vertex came up with a positive surprise of 43.24%.However, our proven model does not conclusively show that Vertex is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. Though the company’s favorable Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) increases the predictive power of ESP, its Earnings ESP of -4.00% leaves surprise prediction inconclusive.

1095,LLY,"We expect Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 results on Jan 31, before the market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 1.94%.Lilly’s shares have risen 16.6% in the past year while the industry recorded an increase of 29%.Lilly’s earnings performance has been modest with earnings missing expectations in three of the last four quarters while beating the same in the remaining one, bringing the average positive surprise to 1.68%.Eli Lilly and Company Price and EPS Surprise  Eli Lilly and Company Price and EPS Surprise | Eli Lilly and Company QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for this quarter.Factors to ConsiderLike the previous couple of quarters, strong uptake of new products like Trulicity, Taltz, Basaglar, Cyramza, Jardiance and Lartruvo is likely to make up for the decline in sales of established products like Zyprexa, Alimta, Cialis, Strattera and Effient.While Trulicity sales are likely to benefit from growth in GLP-1 and market share gains, Jardiance sales are expected to be driven by increased market share within the growing SGLT2 class.Continued strong uptake outside the United States will continue to drive sales of Cyramza. Strong launch uptake is likely to drive sales of Basaglar, Taltz and Lartruvo. Please note that Taltz was approved for a new indication - active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) – in December 2017 - which can bring in some additional sales in the fourth quarter.Meanwhile, the loss of exclusivity for Alimta, Cymbalta, Strattera, Effient, Axiron, Zyprexa, and Evista will continue to hurt volumes. Also, lower demand in the United States due to competitive pressure mainly from immuno-oncology agents is hurting Alimta sales in the country – a trend which is likely to be reflected fourth-quarter results.Another new drug, Olumiant (baricitinib) was launched in select European countries and in Japan last year while it is under review in the United States. In the third quarter, strong launch uptake in Germany led to better sales of the drug. This trend is likely to be reflected in the soon-to-be reported quarter’s results. Lilly and partner Incyte Corporation (INCY  -  Free Report) plan to re-submit the new drug application (NDA) for Olumiant in United States by this month.Some older products like Humalog, Trajenta and Forteo are also expected to do well.Animal segment sales were hurt by global competitive pressure in the first three quarters of 2017 - a trend we are likely to see this time around as well. On the third-quarter conference call, management had said that it is exploring strategic alternatives for this business including a sale, merger or creating a separate company through an initial public offer. A decision regarding the same is expected to be made no later than the middle of this year, the company then said, and Lilly may ultimately opt to retain the business. Investors may look for an update related to the same on the Q4 conference call.Earnings WhispersOur proven model shows that Lilly is likely to beat on earnings because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate is +0.47%. This is a meaningful indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Lilly has a Zacks Rank #3. The combination of Lilly’s Zacks Rank #3 and positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat in the upcoming release.Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5), on the other hand, should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other large-cap health care stocks worth considering per our model. These have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this time around:Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.06% and a Zacks Rank of 3.

Not only are the growth rates impressive, the earnings and revenues beat ratios of 83.8% and 86.5%, respectively, are great too. The robust numbers have pushed healthcare stocks higher by an average 1.2% against the 0.2% gain for the S&P 500 in response to earnings announcements.Among the most notable players, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) was the first major drug company to report earnings on Jan 23, followed by Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) and Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) on Jan 30 and Jan 31, respectively.

1097,LLY,"Shares of Biogen Inc. (BIIB  -  Free Report) declined by almost 3.3% after the company’s Alzheimer's candidate, BAN2401, failed to meet the criteria for success based on a 12-months interim analysis as the primary endpoint in a mid-stage trial. The company is developing the candidate in collaboration with Eisai Co., Ltd.So far this year, shares of Biogen have gained 13.7% compared with the industry’s growth of 3%.The phase II study (Study 201) involves 856 patients with prodromal or mild Alzheimer's disease and positive biomarkers for brain amyloid pathology. The study uses Bayesian Adaptive Randomization Design which allows automatic changes to the design during the study. For early success, Study 201 will explore efficacy and the dose response of BAN2401 with 16 interim analyses, a 12-month evaluation based on Eisai's in-house developed Alzheimer’s disease Composite Score (ADCOMS) and an 18-month comprehensive assessment of treatment with placebo or 5 active arms. The Bayesian analysis at 12 months indicated that ""success was judged as an 80% or higher probability of achieving"" at least a 25% reduction in the rate of decline of ADCOMS versus placebo.The 16 interim analyses assessed potential for futility or stopping for safety. Neither of these conditions was met and the study continues to a full analysis at 18 months.Biogen stated that the 18-month blinded study will continue further analysis, following the predefined study protocol.  A comprehensive final analysis will be conducted at 18 months looking to demonstrate clinically significant results.  Data from the study are expected in the second half of 2018.Biogen is looking to strengthen its AD and other neurodegenerative disorders pipeline. Notably, the company’s Alzheimer's disease (AD) pipeline comprises candidates with different mechanisms of action including anti-tau candidate (BIIB092/BMS-986168-with potential in AD as well as progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP)), anti-amyloid (aducanumab) candidates as well as a BACE inhibitor (elenbecestat) program.However, the successful development of therapies for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease is challenging and we note that several companies have failed in developing treatments for the same. In November 2016, Eli Lilly & Company's (LLY  -  Free Report) anti-amyloid candidate — solanezumab failed to meet the primary endpoint in a late-stage AD study. Consequently, Lilly decided to drop the development of the candidate.Meanwhile, Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) shelved its late-stage Alzheimer’s candidate, bapineuzumab IV, after it failed two phase III studies. Pfizer was developing the candidate in collaboration with Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) and Elan Corporation.The Alzheimer’s disease market represents a huge commercial potential and a successfully developed product could generate billions of dollars in sales once launched.Biogen Inc.

1098,LLY,"Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has granted priority review to its supplemental biologics license application (sBLA) looking for label expansion of its marketed drug, Keytruda (pembrolizumab), for a rare lymphoma indication.The sNDA is looking to expand Keytruda’s label for treatment of adult and pediatric patients with refractory primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL), a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (“NHL”). With the FDA granting a priority review, its response is expected on Apr 3, 2018. If finally approved, this would be the second nod for Keytruda from the regulatory body for treating a hematologic malignancy indication.In March/April, Keytruda was approved both in the United States as well as the EU for refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma, the first Keytruda approval for hematologic malignancy indication.Merck’s shares have declined 3.3% this year so far, underperforming the industry’s16.4% rally.The sBLA was accepted by the FDA based on encouraging data from the ongoing phase II KEYNOTE-170 and the phase Ib KEYNOTE-013 studies. Both trials are evaluating the safety, tolerability and efficacy of Keytruda as a monotherapy on patients with various blood cancers.In the same press release, the company released outcomes from the KEYNOTE-170 study. Data from the study demonstrated that patients with a relapsed/refractory PMBCL achieved an overall response rate of 41%. Additionally, 24% of patients achieved a complete response rate and a 17% partial response rate at median follow-up of 10.5 months. The drug was however, unable to achieve the median duration of response. Finds from the study were presented at the 59th annual meeting of American Society of Hematology.Notably, Keytruda was granted a Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the FDA in January for the aforementioned indication.Per the company’s press release, PMBCL accounts for an almost 2-4% of all NHL in the United States. Hence, approval of the drug for this expanded indication will provide the company with access to a wider patient population with PMBCL.We remind investors that Keytruda is the first anti-PD-1 therapy to gain an FDA approval and is being studied for more than 30 types of cancer in above 650 studies including 400 plus combination trials. Key recent approvals of drugs have been given for indications including advanced bladder cancer, advanced microsatellite instability-high cancers and the first approval as a combination therapy was granted with Eli Lilly's (LLY  -  Free Report) cancer drugs Alimta (pemetrexed) and carboplatin (pem/carbo) for lung cancer.Merck & Company, Inc.

1100,LLY,"Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) announced that its PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor, Opdivo, in combination with Yervoy, demonstrated superiority in improving progression free survival (“PFS”) in a phase III lung cancer study. The positive data again showed the blockbuster potential of Opdivo, which is already approved in multiple indications and is also being evaluated in several others.Shares of the company have returned 18% in the past year, outperforming the industry’s gain of 13.8% in that period.The phase III study – CheckMate-227 – is evaluating Opdivo monotherapy and combination regimens in non-squamous and squamous advanced non-small cell lung cancer (“NSCLC”) in first-line setting. The study is being conducted in three parts.The data was announced from the part of the study, which evaluated the combination regimen for overall survival (“OS”) in patients whose tumors express PD-L1 and for PFS in patients with high tumor mutation burden (“TMB”), regardless of PD-L1 expression.Data showed that the regimen significantly improved PFS in patients compared to chemotherapy.

1101,LLY,"After two days of market sell-off, suddenly everything’s coming up roses again: President Trump’s State of the Union address last night was followed by strong Q4 earnings results before today’s opening bell. We also see better-than-expected results from ADP’s (ADP  -  Free Report) monthly private sector payroll report.In fact, the 234K new jobs created for January was well ahead of the 180K anticipated, and although December’s results were revised downward by 8000 jobs, it still tallied 242K. This is outstanding jobs growth over the past two months, especially considering we have been near peak employment for quite some time now. Services led the way with 212K new jobs, with Manufacturing adding 12K and Construction +9K.Non-farm payroll figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) on Friday morning should be very interesting in light of today’s results. One thing analysts will certainly be looking at - aside from the Unemployment rate, which is expected to dip to 4.0% - with be Average Hourly Wage Growth. With a jobs market this tight, it would stand to reason employees will start to see a rise in their take-home pay. The proof, as they say, will be in the pudding.Q4 Earnings on a RollEven before the strong ADP report came out this morning, the Dow was already trading in the pre-market up more than 200 points - not quite erasing the losses from earlier this week, but definitely helping fill the hole. A big part of this came from a huge earnings report home run from Boeing (BA  -  Free Report).The airplane-making giant brought in $4.80 per share in its Q4 earnings report, far ahead of the $2.91 per share expected in the Zacks consensus estimate. Revenues of $25.78 billion trounced the $24.83 billion analysts were looking for. Backlog was up compared to a year ago for the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company, but guidance was also sharply raised for full-year 2018 compared to expectations. As a result, shares shot up 3.6% initially and are approaching +6% at this hour in the pre-market. For more on BA’s earnings, click here.Big Pharma’s Eli Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) also topped estimates for both earnings and revenues ahead of the opening bell, with $1.14 per share beating by 6 cents and revenues of $6.16 billion up $200 million from the Zacks consensus. Guidance was also upped for full-year to $4.81-4.91 per share, while revenue guidance stayed pat for now.

Guidance was also raised for full-year 2018, to FFO of $11.90-12.02. For more on SPG’s earnings, click here.

1102,LLY,"DexCom, Inc. (DXCM  -  Free Report) recently announced the signing of a development agreement with Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report). Per the agreement, DexCom’s flagship continuous glucose monitoring system (CGM) will be added to Lilly’s Connected Diabetes Ecosystem.Through the integration of CGM with Lily’s smart insulin delivery devices, DexCom aims to provide a holistic approach to diabetes management for its customers. Notably,clinical trials are expected to begin by the end of 2017.DexCom's FDA-cleared CGM system — the DexCom G4 Platinum — is contributing significantly to the top line. DexCom G4 Platinum is the most innovative CGM system in the market. In June, DexCom had announced the FDA approval of the DexCom G5 mobile app for Android devices.Moreover, DexCom has collaborative agreements with several companies, which should not only bring in cash in the form of milestone payments and royalties but should also help expand its product use. In September 2017, DexCom announced a tie-up with leading wearables brand Fitbit to develop and market products to help people better manage diabetes and get a clearer picture of their overall health. The first planned initiative is to bring DexCom CGM data to Fitbit’s new smartwatch, Fitbit Ionic. The companies aim to make the smartwatch available in 2018 and will continue to explore ways to develop tools to improve diabetes management.We believe the glucose monitoring market represents significant commercial opportunity for DexCom. Per a report by Mordor Intelligence, the global market for diabetes care devices is projected to reach a value of $30.25 billion by 2021, at a CAGR of 5.93%. Also, the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) estimates that by 2035, the worldwide incidence of people suffering from diabetes will reach 592 million.Recently, management at DexCom confirmed that the company is well poised to congregate the unmet demand in the global diabetic space, especially when it comes to CGM. DexCom’s increased patient convenience, enhanced connectivity, data analytics, and lower cost platforms fortify the company’s foothold in the global diabetic space.However, the diabetes market is dominated by many well-established players, Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report) being the most prominent one. In this space, Abbott recently announced the receipt of FDA approval for the FreeStyle Libre Flash glucose monitoring system in the United States.Share Price PerformanceDexCom has been gaining investor confidence on consistently positive results. Over the last month, the company’s share price outperformed the broader industry. The stock has gained 23.1%, as compared with the broader industry’s 1%. The company has also outperformed the 0.9% gain of the S&P 500 market.  Zacks Rank & Key PickDexCom carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked medical stock is PetMed Express, Inc.

1103,LLY,"Novartis AG’s (NVS  -  Free Report) CEO of Oncology business, Bruno Strigini, has announced plans to retire citing personal reasons. Strigini will step from the Executive Committee by Dec 31, 2017. Novartis will name a successor shortly.Earlier, in 2017, Novartis announced that CEO Joseph Jimenez will step down from his position in 2018. Vasant Narasimhan, M.D., Global Head of Drug Development and Chief Medical Officer, will replace him effective Feb 1, 2018. Narasimhan is a member of the Executive Committee and joined Novartis in 2005.Novartis is currently going through a transitional stage. In March 2015, Novartis acquired certain oncology products and pipeline compounds from GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK  -  Free Report) for $16 billion. In exchange, it sold its non-influenza Vaccines business to Glaxo for $7.1 billion.In January 2015, Novartis divested its Animal Health Division to Eli Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) for approximately $5.4 billion. Novartis stock has rallied 20.7% in the year so far compared with the industry’s 20.8% gain.The company’s blockbuster drug, Diovan, is facing stiff generic competition in the United States, EU and Japan. Gleevec lost exclusivity in the United States in February 2016. The company also lost patent protection for the drug in EU in December 2016 leading to generic competition. The loss of patent protection for these top-selling drugs continue to hurt sales.The performance of the Alcon business was weak due to competition faced by intraocular lens and a slowdown in demand for equipment purchases. Consequently, Novartis moved its ophthalmic pharmaceuticals business to the company’s pharmaceuticals division. Alcon will now focus on medical devices, surgical and the vision care business with three major businesses — IOLs, consumables behind the equipment, and contact lenses.The turnaround has been encouraging and management believes creating a standalone company via a capital markets exit could create additional shareholder value. A decision is expected in the first half of 2019, depending on Alcon’s performance in the future.Zacks Rank & Key PickNovartis currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the healthcare sector is Corcept Therapeutics Inc.

1104,LLY,"Radius Health, Inc. (RDUS  -  Free Report) announced that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) will provide a third Day-180 List of Outstanding Issues in its regulatory review of abaloparatide-SC.The CHMP informed the company that it will refer the marketing authorisation application (MAA) to a scientific advisory group for additional advice as part of its ongoing risk-benefit assessment.Hence, the CHMP expects to issue an opinion on the same during the first half of 2018.In July 2017, the CHMP issued a second Day-180 List of Outstanding Issues and requested additional data analyses related to the safety and efficacy of abaloparatide-SC for their ongoing regulatory review.The delay in approval in Europe is disappointing given the potential market. Radius Health’s share price has decreased 21.8% in the year so far compared with the industry’s gain of 7.4%.We note that Tymlos (abaloparatide) was approved by the FDA in April 2017 for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture defined as history of osteoporotic fracture, multiple risk factors for fracture, or patients who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapy.Although the osteoporosis market in the United Sates has great potential as approximately 1.4 million postmenopausal women experience an osteoporotic fractur each year, Tymlos is expected to face significant competition from Eli Lilly & Co's (LLY  -  Free Report) Forteo and Amgen Inc's (AMGN  -  Free Report) Prolia.Moreover, the approved label carries a boxed warning of osteosarcoma (a malignant bone tumor).Meanwhile, Radius Health is also developing abaloparatide-TD for as a short wear-time transdermal patch. In December 2015, the company initiated a human replicative clinical evaluation to compare the optimized abaloparatide-TD patch with its subcutaneous formulation. The company posted positive results from the trial in September 2016.The company is currently focused on completing the manufacturing, scale up, and other required activities needed to initiate a pivotal study to evaluate bioequivalence to abaloparatide-SC.

1105,LLY,"Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) reported fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share of $1.14, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.08 per share by 5.6%. Earnings rose 20% from the year-ago quarter backed by higher operating profits.Revenues BeatQuarterly revenues of $6.16 billion also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.96 billion by 3.4%. Sales grew 7% year over year backed by strong performance of new drugs and favorable currency movement to a lesser extent, partially offset by lower sales of established products like Strattera, Humalog, Cialis and Effient. Lilly’s established products portfolio recorded a decline of 6.3% in worldwide revenues.Volumes rose 4% as strong performance of new products like Trulicity, Taltz, Basaglar, Jardiance and Lartruvo offset decline in sales of established products. Higher realized prices for several drugs also contributed 2% to sales growth in the quarter. Foreign exchange rate also hada favorable impact of 1%.Segment RevenuesPharmaceutical revenues rose 9% in the quarter backed by 12% volume growth of the new products.While U.S. revenues grew 6% to $3.42 billion, ex-U.S. revenues rose 8% to $2.74 billion.Established products that recorded growth during the quarter include Forteo (up 21% to $513.2 million), Humulin (up 2% to $362.6 million), Cymbalta (up 6% to $192.8 million) and Erbitux (up 10% to $168.9 million). Sales of all other established products declined in the quarter.Humalog sales declined 5% to $782.2 million due to lower realized prices in the United States. Moreover in December 2017, the FDA approved Sanofi’s (SNY  -  Free Report) Admelog, a biosimilar version of Humalog. This approval will certainly increase competition. Alimta sales declined 3% to $525.2 million, reflecting lower demand in ex-U.S. markets due to competitive pressure and loss of exclusivity in certain countries. However, sales of Alimta increased 1% in the United States due to increased volume, partially offset by lower realized prices.Zyprexa sales declined 1% to $152.2 million due to loss of exclusivity in Japan.Cialis sales declined 12% to $597.4 million hurt by worldwide lower demand.Strattera sales declined 60% to $98.3 million. Effient sales declined 56% to $62.3 million in the quarter. Both the drugs saw lower demand due to loss of exclusivity.Among the new products, Trulicity generated revenues of $649 million, up 93% year over year, with U.S. revenues benefiting from growth in the GLP-1 market and market share gains.Cyramza revenues were $204.8 million, up 16% year over year, backed by strong demand. Cyramza’s ex-U.S. revenues increased 15%, benefiting from strong volumes in Japan, partially offset by lower realized prices. U.S. revenues increased 17% driven by increased volume.Jardiance sales (up 88% to $143.2 million) were driven by increased market share within the growing SGLT2 class in the United States and increased volume outside the United States.Basaglar recorded revenues of $153.8 million compared with $145.7 million in the previous quarter. Basaglar - Lilly and partner Boehringer Ingelheim’s follow-on insulin to Sanofi’s blockbuster drug, Lantus - was launched in the United States in mid-December 2016.Taltz brought in sales of $172.5 million compared with $151.3 million in the previous quarter, reflecting strong uptake. In December 2017, the drug was approved for psoriatic arthritis and launched in the United States. The European Commission also approved the drug last week.Lartruvo (olaratumab) generated revenues of $59 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with $54.5 million in the previous quarter. Lartruvo was launched in the United States and the EU for soft tissue sarcoma in the fourth quarter of 2016.Lilly and partner Incyte Corporation’s (INCY  -  Free Report) rheumatoid arthritis drug, Olumiant (baricitinib) has been launched in select European countries and in Japan. The drug generated sales of $23 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with $16.2 million in the previous quarter backed by strong launch uptake in Germany.However, in the United States, Lilly received a complete response letter from the FDA for baricitinib in April for want of additional data. The company has re-submitted the application in late 2017.Verzenio, which was launched in the Unites States in the fourth quarter of 2017, Generated a sales of $21 million.Lilly's Elanco Animal Health segment sales declined 6% to $790.9 million due to decrease in food animal revenues (down 8% to $547.4 million). However, companion animal revenues increased 1%, including revenues from the acquisition of Boehringer Ingelheim Vetmedica's U.S. feline, canine and rabies vaccine portfolio (acquired in January 2017) which was offset by competitive pressure and lower demand in the United States.Gross Margin Down but Operating Income RisesAdjusted gross margin of 76.5% in the quarter decreased 90 basis points as manufacturing efficiencies were offset by negative product mix and the effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold.Operating income increased 20% year over year to $1.46 billion. Total operating expenses, as a percent of revenues, declined 340 basis points in the quarter to 52.8%.2018 EPS Guidance UppedLilly raised its previously issued 2018 adjusted earnings outlook. Adjusted earnings per share are now expected in the range of $4.81 to $4.91 compared with $4.60 to $4.70 expected previously, reflecting positive impact of the U.S. tax reform. However, revenues are still expected in the range of $23.0 billion and $23.5 billion.Gross margin is expected to be approximately 75%, same as previously expected. Adjusted tax rate is expected to be approximately 18% (previously approximately 21.5%).Marketing, selling and administrative expenses are still expected in the range of $6.1-$6.4 billion, while research and development expenses are projected to be $5.0-$5.2 billion.Our TakeLilly’s fourth-quarter 2017 results were strong with the company beating estimates on both counts. Meanwhile expectations for a lower tax rate due to new tax laws propelled the company to raise its 2018 earnings outlook.Shares were up 1.1% in pre-market trading. Lilly’s share price has risen 11.7% in the past year compared with an increase of 24.2% for the industry. Going forward, new products like Trulicity, Taltz, Basaglar, Cyramza, Jardiance and Lartruvo are expected to see higher revenues. Lilly is also progressing well with its pipeline. The FDA approval for Taltz’s line extension will also boost Lilly’s product revenues. In October 2017, Lilly has announced that it is looking to sell or spin-off its Elanco Animal Health business. Potential sale of its underperforming Animal Health segment may help improve margins.However, Alimta will continue to be impacted by competition. Other headwinds include competition from immuno-oncology agents as well as loss of exclusivity for many drugs in emerging markets.Eli Lilly and Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Eli Lilly and Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Eli Lilly and Company Quote Zacks Rank & Stock to ConsiderLilly carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1106,LLY,"Indianapolis, IN based Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report), is a global healthcare company with core products in a number of primary-care pharmaceutical markets. Lilly generates revenues from its pharmaceutical product and animal health segments.The company’s portfolio includes Zyprexa (schizophrenia and bipolar disorder), Gemzar (pancreatic cancer), Evista (osteoporosis), Cymbalta (depression), Cialis (erectile dysfunction), Strattera (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder - ADHD), Erbitux (cancer) and Alimta (chemotherapy). Lilly also has a strong presence in the diabetes market. However, many of its key products like Cymbalta and Alimta are facing generic competition. The company also has some new products like Trulicity, Cyramza, Jardiance, and Taltz in its portfolio which are driving revenues.Lilly’s earnings performance has been mixed with earnings missing expectations in two of the last four quarters while beating the same in the other two, bringing the average negative surprise to 0.89%.Currently, Lilly has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), but that could definitely change following the company’s earnings report which was just released. We have highlighted some of the key stats from this just-revealed announcement below:Earnings Beat: Lilly beat on third quarter earnings. The company reported EPS of $1.05 per share while our consensus called for EPS of $1.03.Revenues Beat: Revenues also beat expectations. Lilly posted revenues of $5.66 billion, compared to our consensus estimate of $5.52 billion.2017 Outlook Upped: Lilly raised its previously issued 2017 adjusted earnings and sales outlook – for the second time this year. Adjusted earnings per share are now expected in the range of $4.15 to $4.25 compared with $4.10 to $4.20 expected previously. Revenues are expected in the range of $22.4 billion and $22.7 billion, up from $22.0–$22.5 billion expected previously. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings and revenues is $4.15 per share and $22.43 billion, respectively.Strategic Initiatives: Concurrent with the earnings release, Lilly said it is exploring strategic alternatives for the Elanco Animal Health business including a spin-off, sale, merger or creating a separate company through an initial public offer. A decision regarding the same is expected to be made by middle of next year and Lilly may ultimately opt to retain the business.Stock Price Impact: Shares were up 1.5% in pre-market trading.Check back later for our full write up on this Lilly earnings report later!Eli Lilly and Company Price and Consensus  Eli Lilly and Company Price and Consensus | Eli Lilly and Company QuoteToday's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

1107,LLY,"We expect  Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 27, before market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 16.09%.Merck’s performance has been pretty impressive, with the company exceeding earnings expectations in all the trailing four quarters. The average positive earnings surprise over the last four quarters is 8.11%Merck’s shares have risen 7.7% this year so far, comparing unfavorably with 20.5% increase for the industry.Factors to ConsiderMerck’s new products like Keytruda (cancer), Zepatier (HCV) and Bridion (sugammadex) Injection are likely to drive the top line this quarter.Keytruda sales in the United States are gaining particularly on the back of strong momentum in the new indication of first-line lung cancer. The Keytruda development program significantly advanced in the first half with regulatory approvals for four new indications in the United States and an additional indication in Europe. Key recent approvals include that for advanced bladder cancer, advanced microsatellite instability-high cancers and first approval as a combination therapy with Eli Lilly’s (LLY  -  Free Report) cancer drug Alimta (pemetrexed) and carboplatin (pem/carbo) in lung cancer.The new approvals have expanded the patient population, which is expected to drive sales in the third quarter.However, at the Q2 call, management warned that Zepatier uptake may be impacted by the ongoing decline in overall patient volumes in many markets and increased competition. Previously, strong underlying demand trends in the United States, Europe, and Japan had supported Zepatier’s sales.The company also faces headwinds in the form of genericization as well as increasing competition and the negative impact of currency exchange.Sales of Remicade (lost exclusivity in Europe and facing stiff biosimilar competition in the region), Cubicin (lost patent protection in the United States in June 2016), Zetia (lost market exclusivity in the United States in December 2016) and Vytorin (lost U.S. exclusivity in April 2017) are likely to decline in the quarter.Sluggish growth of the integrase class and continued competitor dynamics in the United States and Europe will continue to affect Isentress’ sales. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Isentress sales is $306 million for the third quarter.Investors will also be focused on the performance of Merck’s DPP-4 inhibitor – Januvia. Pricing pressure hurt sales of the Januvia/Janumet franchise in the first half.The Vaccines and Animal Health franchises are expected to boost sales this quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Vaccines (total) and Animal Health segments is $1.83 billion and $911 million, respectively.At the Q2 call, Merck mentioned a network cyber-attack in June that disrupted its global operations, including manufacturing, research, and sales. At that time, Merck had said that full recovery from the cyber-attack will take some time, which could result in a temporary delay in fulfilling orders of some products (not Keytruda, Zepatier and Januvia) in certain markets. We expect an update on this at the upcoming conference call.Remediation expenses related to the cyber-attack, increased investments behind the ongoing launches and additional R&D costs associated with the new oncology collaboration with AstraZeneca are expected to result in higher operating costs in the quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model shows that Merck is likely to beat estimates this quarter because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for a likely positive surprise.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate ($1.03 per share) and the Zacks Consensus Estimate ($1.02 per share), is +0.61%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Merck has a Zacks Rank #3. The combination of Merck’s Zacks Rank #3 and positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat in the upcoming release.Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5), on the other hand, should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Merck & Company, Inc.

J&J reported better-than-expected third-quarter 2017 results and raised its 2017 sales and profit outlook. J&J’s sales growth accelerated in the third quarter, leading the company to post its first positive sales surprise after almost a year.Here we have three biotech/pharma giants that are set to report third-quarter results on Oct 24. Let's see how things are shaping up for this quarter.Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report)Lilly, which is scheduled to release earnings before the market opens, had delivered a positive earnings surprise of 6.73% last quarter. Lilly’s earnings performance has been mixed with earnings missing expectations in two of the last four quarters while beating the same in the other two, bringing the average negative surprise to 0.89%.For this quarter, Lilly has an Earnings ESP of -0.21% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.03 per share. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.New products like Trulicity, Cyramza, Taltz and Jardiance have supported the top line in the past few quarters. We expect the trend to continue in the third quarter as well. However, decline in sales of Alimta, Cymbalta and Zyprexa is expected to continue due to the loss of exclusivity.

(BIIB  -  Free Report)Biogen, a well-known name in the multiple sclerosis (MS) market, is also scheduled to announce results before the opening bell.

Investor focus will also be on Spinraza’s performance (Read More: Biogen Q3 Earnings: Will it Deliver a Beat Again?)Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report)The Swiss pharma giant is expected to report before market opens.

1109,LLY,"Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) kicked off third quarter earnings season for the pharmaceutical sector on a strong note with the company beating on both earnings and revenues. While focus remained on J&J’s strong earnings results, companies like Allergan (AGN  -  Free Report) were also in the news regarding patent litigation.   Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesJ&J Q3 Results Impress, Raises Outlook: J&J’s Q3 earnings results were strong with the company beating on both earnings and revenues. All three segments (Consumer, Medical Devices and Pharmaceuticals) did well with oncology recording robust growth. Results included contribution from pulmonary hypertension products which became a part of the company’s portfolio following its acquisition of Actelion. Based on solid third quarter results, J&J raised its outlook for the year as well (Read more: J&J Beats on Q3 Earnings, Actelion Buyout Drives Sales).The company has gained 23.3% year to date, compared to the 20.6% rally of the industry it belongs to.Sanofi’s Dupixent Tops in Allergic Inflammatory Disease Study: Sanofi and partner Regeneron Pharmaceuticals announced positive phase II results on Dupixent (dupilumab) in adults with active moderate-to-severe eosinophilic esophagitis, a chronic, allergic inflammatory disease. Patients receiving Dupixent weekly reported a significant improvement in the ability to swallow versus placebo (Read more: Sanofi/Regeneron's Dupixent Succeeds in Phase II Study). The market could be huge for Dupixent if it gains timely approval given the lack of any FDA-approved treatments. Dupixent has orphan drug status in the United States for this indication.Dupixent, which has blockbuster potential, is currently approved for eczema and is being evaluated for additional indications apart from eosinophilic esophagitis. In fact, last month, the companies had announced positive top-line data from a late-stage study on Dupixent for uncontrolled persistent asthma.  Regeneron and Sanofi are also collaborating with Aimmune Therapeutics, a clinical-stage company focused on the development of treatments for potentially life-threatening food allergies. Under the clinical collaboration, Aimmune’s AR101 will be evaluated with adjunctive Dupixent in peanut-allergic patients in a mid-stage study that is scheduled to commence next year. The study will be sponsored by Regeneron while Aimmune will provide clinical supply of AR101 and food challenge materials.Data on Merck’s Keytruda, Priority Review for Lynparza sNDA: Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) presented updated overall survival (“OS”) data on its anti-PD-1 therapy, Keytruda, for the first-line treatment of patients suffering from metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with high levels of PD-L1. The company said that the additional six months of available data continued to show a reduction in the risk of death by 37% for Keytruda compared to chemotherapy. Keytruda more than doubled median OS compared to chemotherapy after two years of follow up.Keytruda is a key product in Merck’s portfolio with the drug bringing in sales of $1.5 billion in the first half of 2017.Merck and partner AstraZeneca also announced that they have been granted priority review by the FDA for their supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for the use of PARP inhibitor Lynparza tablets in patients with gBRCA, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer (“MBC”) who have been previously treated with chemotherapy either in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant or metastatic settings. A response from the agency is expected in the first quarter of 2018.Novo Nordisk Diabetes Drug Gets FDA Panel Support: Novo Nordisk (NVO  -  Free Report) got a boost with an FDA advisory panel (the Endocrinologic and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee) voting unanimously (16-0) in favor of approving once-weekly semaglutide for use in type II diabetes patients. Given the favorable vote, chances of gaining FDA approval look pretty high. On its second quarter call, Novo Nordisk had said that it expects a decision from the FDA by year end. Semaglutide’s approval would be a major positive for the company with the drug expected to be a key growth driver.Novo Nordisk is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock - you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Priority Review for BMY Drug Label Expansion: Bristol-Myers Squibb Company’s (BMY  -  Free Report) immuno-oncology therapy, Opdivo, has been granted priority review by the FDA for label expansion into the treatment of melanoma patients who are at high risk of disease recurrence following complete surgical resection. Opdivo, one of the prioritized brands in Bristol-Myers’ portfolio, brought in sales of $2.3 billion in the first half of 2017 (Read more: Bristol-Myers Gets Priority Review for Opdivo Label Expansion).Adverse Ruling for Allergan in Restasis Patent Litigation: Allergan continues to make headlines related to its blockbuster eye drug, Restasis. This time round, the company announced that it has received an adverse ruling from the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas regarding four patents covering the drug. The court found the patents to be invalid. Allergan intends to appeal the ruling and said that the FDA is yet to approve any generic version of the drug. However, ophthalmology-focused company, Imprimis Pharmaceuticals, announced that it is working on making lower-cost alternatives to Restasis available. The company said that initial prescriptions will be 99 cents for a one month supply while refills will start at $79 per month, including shipping.According to Allergan, the Restasis patents are scheduled to expire on Aug 27, 2024. Allergan, which entered into a settlement agreement with a generic challenger recently (InnoPharma), has been adopting different ways to protect Restasis from generic competition. The company came under fire for entering into an agreement with the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe, with lawmakers questioning the unconventional move adopted by the company to protect the drug from generic competition. Restasis is Allergan’s second best-selling drug bringing in sales of almost $1.5 billion in 2016. Lawmakers pointed out that the sovereign status of Native American tribes would make any patent challenges lengthy and complex as tribes may be immune from the legal claims made by generic drug makers to challenge patents. The deal has basically raised concerns that it will curb generic competition in the pharmaceutical industry and discourage generic drugmakers from making cheaper copy-cat versions of expensive drugs.Impax to Combine with Amneal: Specialty pharma company Impax Laboratories  will be merging with privately-held generic company Amneal Pharmaceuticals in an all-stock transaction. With this merger, the combined company will have high-value generic product pipelines and a growing specialty business. The deal is expected to boost Impax’s stand-alone earnings per share in the first 12 months and generate double-digit revenue and earnings per share growth over the three years following the close of the transaction. Annual cost synergies of about $200 million are expected to be achieved within three years. The merger is expected to go through in the first half of 2018 (Read more: Impax Laboratories and Amneal Pharmaceuticals Agree to Merge).PerformanceLarge Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % Return Large Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % ReturnThe NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index was up 1% this week with the sector reacting positively to J&J’s Q3 results.

1110,LLY,"Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) announced top-line data from the phase III study – RAINFALL – evaluating Cyramza (ramucirumab) as first-line treatment for patients with advanced gastric cancer. The study met its primary endpoint of progression free survival (""PFS"") but failed to improve overall survival (""OS""). The results will be presented at a future medical meeting.The company has also announced that it will not seek regulatory approval in the first-line setting based on the data from this study.Cyramza is presently approved as a single agent or in combination with chemotherapy drug, paclitaxel, for treating advanced or metastatic gastric (stomach) or gastroesophageal junction (“GEJ”) adenocarcinoma in patients whose disease has progressed after prior therapies. The drug is also approved for treating metastatic non-small cell lung cancer and for metastatic colorectal cancer (with tradename Folfiri).Shares of Lilly have gained 6.9% in the past six months, outperforming the industry’s rise of 4.5% in that period.The RAINFALL study evaluated Cyramza in combination with cisplatin and capecitabine or 5-fluorouracil as first-line treatment for HER2-negative metastatic gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma versus a placeboThe company was hopeful that the positive PFS would lead to an OS benefit. Treating advanced gastric cancer is a challenge, which is further underscored by the fact that no major advances over chemotherapies have been achieved for treating metastatic gastric cancer.Moreover, initial data from another phase III study on Cyramza presented at ESMO 2017 Congress showed that the drug met PFS endpoint in patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma.Per the press release, gastric cancer is the fifth most common form of cancer in the world.

1111,LLY,"Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) announced that the European Commission (EC) has approved Tasigna for the treatment of pediatric patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia in the chronic phase (Ph+ CML-CP) and pediatric patients with Ph+ CML-CP with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy including imatinib.An approval was in the cards as European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use had given a positive opinion on the same.We note that Tasigna is already approved for the treatment of chronic phase and accelerated phase Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia (Ph+ CML) in adult patients, resistant or intolerant to at least one prior therapy, including Glivec. It is also approved for the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed Ph+ CML in chronic phase.The drug is also approved in the European Union for the treatment of Ph+ CML in the chronic phase in pediatric patients with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy including Glivec.Hence, a label expansion for the treatment of children with CML will boost sales of the drug given limited treatment options for the same.In June 2017, Tasigna became the first and only TKI to include information on stopping therapy in adult patients with Ph+ CML-CP in both the first-line setting and after switching from Glivec in the EU label.  Novartis’ stock has rallied 3.7% year to date compared with the industry’s  6.8% gain.We remind investors Novartis broadened its oncology portfolio by acquiring GlaxoSmithKline plc’s (GSK  -  Free Report) certain oncology products and pipeline compounds in March 2015 after having divested its Animal Health Division to Eli Lilly and Co.

This will delay generic competition for the drug for an additional six months.The pediatric exclusivity has pushed back patent expiry of the oral PDE-5 inhibitor to May 2018. The patent was otherwise set to expire this month. This means a generic version of the drug cannot be approved until then.Shares of United Therapeutics were up 2.6% on Monday, in response to the positive development. However, a look at United Therapeutics’ share price movement shows that the stock has underperformed the industry this year so far. United Therapeutics stock has declined 12% during this period, while the industry rose 2%.We remind investors that United Therapeutics bought exclusive rights to commercialize Adcirca for the treatment of PAH in the United States from Eli Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) in November 2008. Tadalafil is also sold by Lilly as Cialis for erectile dysfunction.The additional exclusivity for Adcirca was based on some study data submitted by Lilly to the FDA.Separately, United Therapeutics will be required to pay higher royalties on sales of Adcirca, effective from next month, per a previously announced amendment to the licensing agreement. The royalty rate on Adcirca sales is up from 5% to 10%. United Therapeutics also has to make milestone payments of $325,000 for each $1,000,000 in net product sales.Adcirca generated sales of $300.4 million in the nine months of 2017, up 15.8% year over year.Meanwhile, the company has three more PAH products in its portfolio – Remodulin, Tyvaso and Orenitram. With these products, United Therapeutics has a varied range of therapies targeting the PAH market.Lately, growth of Orenitram, Tyvaso and Remodulin has slowed down due to competition, mainly from Actelion’s new drug, Uptravi (selexipag). Actelion is now part of Johnson & Jonson (JNJ  -  Free Report). Also some patients are staying longer on front-line oral AMBITION combination therapy (Adcirca + Gilead’s (GILD  -  Free Report) Letairis) and delaying the transition to inhaled/injectable therapies like Tyvaso/Remodulin, thereby hurting their demand.Meanwhile, Remodulin, which accounts for more than 35% of United Therapeutics’ total sales, could start facing generic competition after June 2018.United Therapeutics carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1114,LLY,"This week, companies like Novo Nordisk (NVO  -  Free Report) and Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) were in the news with both providing regulatory updates. While Novo Nordisk gained approval for a new type II diabetes drug, the FDA expanded the label of Lilly’s Taltz.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesNovo Nordisk Diabetes Drug Gets FDA Nod: Novo Nordisk got a major boost with the FDA approving the company’s new type II diabetes drug, Ozempic. Ozempic, a once-weekly GLP-1 agonist, is approved for use as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type II diabetes mellitus. Approval comes shortly after an FDA advisory panel had voted in favor of approving the drug.Although Ozempic will enter a highly crowded market, it has been shown to lead to clinically meaningful and statistically significant reductions in HbA1c compared with placebo, Januvia (sitagliptin), Bydureon (exenatide extended-release) and Lantus (insulin glargine U100). Ozempic is also associated with weight loss. Ozempic is expected to enter the market in early 2018 and represents blockbuster potential (Read more: Novo Nordisk's Semaglutide Gets FDA Approval for Diabetes).Positive Data on J&J and AbbVie’s Imbruvica-Rituxan Combo for WM: Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) and partner, AbbVie presented data on a combination of their BTK inhibitor, Imbruvica, and Rituxan for the treatment of both newly and previously-treated patients with Waldenström's macroglobulinemia (“WM”). The primary endpoint of progression-free survival (“PFS”) was achieved in the late-stage study. Imbruvica is approved for different indications including chronic lymphocytic leukemia, previously treated mantle cell lymphoma and WM as well as chronic graft-versus-host-disease (Read more: AbbVie/J&J's Imbruvica Succeeds in Combo Study with Rituxan).J&J is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock - you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. The stock has gained 21.5% year to date, compared to the 14.7% rally of the industry it belongs to.Sanofi Presents Toujeo Head-to-Head Data, Ends c. difficile Vaccine Development: Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report) presented positive data on Toujeo from a head-to-head study versus insulin degludec. The effect of Toujeo on blood sugar levels was found to be similar to that of insulin degludec (Read more: Sanofi's Toujeo Meets Key Objective in Head-to-Head Study). Sanofi also announced that it has decided to end the development of its clostridium difficile vaccine based on a planned interim analysis which showed that the chances of the vaccine meeting the primary endpoint in a late-stage study were low.This is the latest blow for the company’s vaccine segment which is facing issues with its dengue vaccine, Dengvaxia, due to safety concerns. Earlier this week, the Philippines FDA asked the company to suspend the sale/distribution/marketing of Dengvaxia and withdraw it from the market pending compliance with the directives of the agency.Second Indication Approved for Lilly’s Taltz: Lilly’s Taltz (ixekizumab) gained FDA approval for its second indication with the agency giving its nod for the use of the drug for the treatment of adults with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Taltz was initially approved for the treatment of adult patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy. Taltz works by specifically targeting IL-17A, a protein that plays a role in driving underlying inflammation in psoriasis (Read more: Lilly's Taltz Gets Approval for Label Expansion in US).FDA Nod for First Herceptin Biosimilar: The FDA granted approval to Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report) and Biocon’s biosimilar version of Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) blockbuster cancer drug, Herceptin (trastuzumab). We remind investors that earlier this year in July, the FDA’s Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (“ODAC”) had voted in favor of approving the biosimilar. Ogivri has been approved for all indications of the reference product, Herceptin, which includes the treatment of HER2-positive breast and gastric cancers. PerformanceLarge Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % Return Large Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % ReturnThe NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index declined 1.6% over the last five trading sessions.

1115,LLY,"Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) announced encouraging new data of a post-hoc analysis from a phase III study, evaluating the combination of its breast cancer drug, Ibrance (palbociclib), with Novartis' (NVS  -  Free Report) Femara (letrozole) for the first-line treatment of ER+, HER2- metastatic breast cancer.Notably, data from the study will be presented at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (SABCS) on Dec 8.Ibrance is approved in the United States for treating HR+/HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer in combination with an aromatase inhibitor as an initial endocrine-based therapy in postmenopausal women. It is also approved to be used with AstraZeneca's (AZN  -  Free Report) Faslodex in women with disease progression following the endocrine therapy. Presently, Ibrance is approved in more than 75 countries.Pfizer’s shares are up 9.9% so far this year, comparing unfavorably with the industry’s return of 16.5%. In the PALOMA-2 study, it was seen that a combination of Ibrance and Femara led to an improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) or the time before recurrence of tumor growth by more than a year compared with Femara plus placebo. In other words, the study showed that the median PFS for women treated with Ibrance plus Femara was 27.6 months compared with 14.5 months for the Femara-placebo combination arm, thereby indicating a 44% reduction in the risk of disease progression.PALOMA-2 had enrolled 666 women in all from 186 global sites across 17 countries. The updated results and the safety profile from the post-hoc analysis are consistent with the primary data from the PALOMA-2 study, reported last November.We remind investors that Ibrance in combination with Femara was cleared in the United States under an accelerated approval in February 2015 for treatment of HR+/HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer. In April, Pfizer received a regular approval for the drug based on data from the PALOMA-2 trial. Also, around the same time, Ibrance’s label was expanded covering a few more indications to be used in combination with any aromatase inhibitor and not just Femara.Pfizer is exploring the possibility of expanding Ibrance into recurrent and subsequent early breast cancer as well as several non-breast cancer indications like pancreatic and head and neck cancers.Ibrance has been generating strong sales as a key driver of the company’s top line. The drug logged sales of $2.41 billion in the first nine months of 2017, up 61% year over year. On successful label expansion, the drug should reap in more revenues.However, in the breast cancer market, competition for Ibrance has increased with recent launches for Eli Lilly's (LLY  -  Free Report) Verzenio and Novartis’ Kisqali.Pfizer, Inc.

1116,LLY,"Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has approved the label expansion of its psoriasis drug, Taltz, to include the treatment of active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in adults.We note that Taltz is presently approved for treating moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in adults who can have systemic therapy or phototherapy.The drug has grown more than 50% in the first nine months of 2017 and contributed significantly to revenues and volumes. This approval for an expanded label in the United States is expected to further boost its growth.Lilly’s stock price has increased 26.9% in the past one year, outperforming the industry’s gain of 20%.Coming back to the news, the FDA’s approval for Taltz’ label expansion was based on data from two phase III studies – SPIRIT-P1 and SPIRIT-P2 – evaluating the drug in active PsA patients, who have not received any  antirheumatic drug therapy or who have failed one or two  tumor necrosis factor (“TNF”) inhibitors, respectively.The drug achieved a reduction of 20% or more in a composite measure of disease activity (ACR20) in more than half of the patient population in both the studies at 24 weeks.The drug (80 mg/mL) can be injected as single agent or in combination with any disease-modifying antirheumatic drug like methotrexate.However, Taltz will face competition from several drugs, especially Novartis’ (NVS  -  Free Report) Cosentyx, as both the drug works by targeting IL-17A. Cosentyx is also approved for PsA and plaque psoriasis.PsA is a chronic form of inflammatory arthritis, which is painful and progressive as well. Per the press release, approximately 1.6 million people in the United States are affected by the disease.

1117,LLY,"Shares of ImmunoGen, Inc. (IMGN  -  Free Report) have been massively up 192.7% this year so far, outperforming the industry’s registered 4.3% increase. Let’s analyze the factors that led to this rally.ImmunoGen’s rapid pipeline progress along with positive readouts and strategic collaborations has pushed its share price up consistently.ImmunoGen has made a significant progress with regard to its lead pipeline candidate, mirvetuximab soravtansine this year. The candidate is being evaluated in a phase III study (FORWARD I) on as a single-agent therapy for treating patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. The company has presently activated over 90 sites for enrolment under the trial, which it aims to complete by the middle of 2018. Also, the candidate is being evaluated in three phase I expansion cohorts on 113 ovarian cancer patients. In May, the company reported positive data from the study which demonstrated promising safety and efficacy profile of the candidate.Meanwhile, combination regimens with mirvetuximab soravtansine in ovarian cancer are also being evaluated in phase Ib/II FORWARD II study. The FORWARD II trial consists of cohorts assessing mirvetuximab soravtansine in combination with Roche's (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Avastin and Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda. In May, ImmunoGen had reported initial data from this study, showing mirvetuximab soravtansine with potential to complement the currently available therapies for the indication. Approval for any of these combination regimes will significantly expand the eligible patient population for mirvetuximab soravtansine.An approval of mirvetuximab soravtansine would be a huge boost to ImmunoGen, given its immense commercial potential in the target market. Ovarian cancer results in maximum annual deaths among gynecologic cancers with majority of the patients diagnosed at an advanced stage. Per data provided by the American Cancer Society, approximately 22,440 new cases of ovarian cancer will be diagnosed in the United States in 2017, resulting in more than 14,080 deaths.Apart from mirvetuximab soravtansine, ImmunoGen is working on developing a couple of other clinical/pre-clinical candidates including IMGN779 and IMGN632. Notably, IMGN779 is being evaluated in a phase I study for treating acute myeloid leukemia (“AML”) with data expected later this year. On the other hand, the company plans to move IMGN632 into clinical development before the year-end to treat hematological malignancies including AML.ImmunoGen has agreements with several big healthcare companies including Amgen, Bayer, Eli Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report), Novartis, Roche, Sanofi and Takeda. These contracts allow other companies to use ImmunoGen’s ADC technology and provide it with funds in the form of license and milestone fees, royalties, clinical materials revenues and R&D support fees.  Notably, in August, ImmunoGen had announced a strategic collaboration and option agreement with Jazz Pharmaceuticals for development and commercialization of the two candidates under ADC programs, IMGN779 and IMGN632. Pursuant to the deal, ImmunoGen would be eligible to receive milestone payments based on certain pre-decided conditions.Though the platinum-resistant ovarian cancer market offers an immense commercial potential, ImmunoGen is notably set to face intense competition, upon approval. However, mirvetuximab soravtansine looks promising at this juncture and its approval will be a big lift to the company.ImmunoGen carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1118,LLY,"There was not much activity in the U.S. cancer space this week. However, we saw two drugs getting regulatory nod from the European Commission (""EC""). Zejula received approval as monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer patients. It is set to give AstraZeneca (AZN  -  Free Report)/Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Lynparza a run for its money in the PARP-inhibitor space in Europe. On the other hand, Novartis’ (NVS  -  Free Report) Tasigna received approval for label expansion in the first-line setting for paediatric patients with chronic myeloid leukemia.Meanwhile, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) submitted regulatory applications for label expansion of Darzalex as first-line therapy for multiple myeloma in both the United States and Europe. Moreover, Roche Holding (RHHBY  -  Free Report) announced encouraging results from a phase III study evaluating Tecentriq in combination with chemotherapy in stage IV non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (""NSCLC"").Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesTESARO’s Zejula Approved in Europe: The European Commission has granted marketing authorization to Zejula as maintenance treatment for women with recurrent ovarian cancer. It is the first PARP inhibitor to receive approval in Europe, which does not require BRCA mutation or other biomarker testing. The drug is already marketed in the United States in the same indication.Zejula will now compete with Lynparza that is already approved in Europe. However, Zejula has an edge as Lynparza requires BRCA-mutation status in Europe. Zejula has performed well in the United States since launch.

1119,LLY,"After a weak performance in 2016 due to drug pricing issues, the pharma industry has bounced back this year except for a minor correction recently. While Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) was one of the very few companies whose shares were up last year notwithstanding the industry’s decline, it’s the other way round this year.Shares of Merck have declined 7.6% this year against a 14.8% increase for the Large-Cap Pharma industry. Let us discuss why.Merck has suffered some notable pipeline setbacks this year. In October, Merck decided not to seek approval for its CETP inhibitor anacetrapib for cholesterol management as its clinical profile was not strong enough to support regulatory filings.Last month, the company also announced a delay in the readout from an important lung cancer study. It said that since it was including overall survival as a co-primary endpoint in the KEYNOTE-189 phase III study of Keytruda in first-line lung cancer, it will delay the readout from the study to 2019. This raised investor concern, as the delay in the readout can give competitors a chance to gain strength in the lung cancer market.In October, Merck also withdrew a regulatory application in Europe, which was looking to get Keytruda approved as first-line combination therapy for lung cancer. Please note that since October, shares of Merck are down 15.1% -- the result of these back-to-back pipeline setbacks.In September, Merck discontinued the development of two of its HCV combination programs — MK-3682B and MK-3682C — saying that the HCV market is becoming extremely crowded. Also, three combination studies of Keytruda for multiple myeloma were placed on clinical hold following reports of death in Keytruda groups in July. Keytruda is seen as a key long-term growth driver at Merck and such setbacks do not bode well for the company.It remains to be seen if the strong performance of its new drugs, particularly Keytruda, its strong vaccines and animal health business and cost saving efforts can help Merck pick up from here.Merck carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1120,LLY,"Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) along with Boehringer Ingelheim announced positive top-line data from two clinical studies – EASE 2 and EASE 3 – from the phase III EASE program evaluating SGLT2 inhibitor, Jardiance (empagliflozin), in type I diabetes.Data showed that Jardiance in addition to insulin therapy met the primary endpoint of reduction of A1C, average blood sugar level, from baseline after 26 weeks of treatment. Detailed results will be presented at the European Association for the Study of Diabetes Annual Meeting in October.The studies evaluated three doses of Jardiance – 2.5mg, 10mg and 25mg – in adult patients. Type I diabetes is a chronic disease that impacts the production of insulin in body, which controls blood sugar level. The disease affects approximately 1.3 million adults in the United States among whom more than two-thirds cannot meet target blood sugar levels, requiring life-long daily insulin administration.Jardiance is approved for treating type II diabetes. A potential approval in type I diabetes will boost the prospects of the drug.Year to date, shares of Lilly have risen 1.6% against the industry’s decline of 4.8%.In a separate press release, Lilly announced data from phase III VIVID study evaluating Humulin R U-500 delivered through Insulet Corporation’s (PODD  -  Free Report) investigational insulin pump Omnipod U-500 compared to multiple daily injections (“MDI”). The study evaluated Humulin R U-500, a highly concentrated insulin formulation, in insulin-resistant type II diabetes patients and who require daily doses of more than 200 units of insulin.Data showed that the drug administered through the investigational pump reduced A1C levels by 1.27% from baseline after 26-weeks compared to 0.85% for MDI administration. Moreover, administration through the pump also lowered total daily insulin dose by 0.47 units/kg compared to MDI.Eli Lilly and Company Price  Eli Lilly and Company Price | Eli Lilly and Company QuoteZacks Rank & Stock to ConsiderLilly currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1121,LLY,"Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of $1.11 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.03 by 7.8%. Earnings rose 3.7% year over year.Among other items, adjusted earnings exclude a charge related to its new oncology collaboration with Britain's AstraZeneca (AZN  -  Free Report).Revenues for the quarter declined 2% year over year to $10.33 billion. Sales also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10.51 billion. Currency movement positively impacted revenues by 1%. Excluding currency impact, sales declined 3% year over year.Lost sales in some markets due to a network cyber-attack in June hurt the top line in the quarter. Meanwhile, unfavorable comparisons with the third quarter of last year hurt sales.Quarter in DetailThe Pharmaceutical segment generated revenues of $9.2 billion, down 3% (down 4% excluding Fx impact) year over year as continued strong sales of PD-1 inhibitor, Keytruda were offset by lower sales of key products like diabetes drug Januvia and HPV vaccine Gardasil/Gardasil 9. As in the previous quarters, loss of market exclusivity for several drugs also hurt the top line.Keytruda brought in sales of $1.05 billion in third-quarter 2017, up 21% sequentially and 194% year over year. Sales continued to be driven by the launch of new indications globally. Keytruda sales are gaining particularly from strong momentum in the indication of first-line lung cancer.Keytruda is already approved for many types of cancers and treatment settings including lung cancer, melanoma, head and neck cancer, classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma and bladder cancer.Meanwhile, the Keytruda development program significantly advanced in the first half with regulatory approvals for four new indications in the United States and an additional indication in Europe. Key recent approvals include that for advanced bladder cancer, advanced microsatellite instability-high cancers and first approval as a combination therapy with Eli Lilly’s (LLY  -  Free Report) cancer drug Alimta (pemetrexed) and carboplatin (pem/carbo) in lung cancer.The new approvals have expanded the patient population, which we believe drove sales in the third quarter.Zepatier brought in sales of $468 million, down from $517 million in the previous quarter.Bridion (sugammadex) Injection generated sales of $185 million in the quarter, up 33% year over year, driven by the strong uptake following its launch in the United States.Meanwhile, combined sales of Remicade (lost exclusivity in Europe and facing stiff biosimilar competition in the region), Cubicin (lost patent protection in the United States in June 2016), Zetia (lost market exclusivity in the United States in December 2016) and Vytorin (lost U.S. exclusivity in April 2017) declined $800 million in the quarter.Remicade sales declined 31% to $214 million in the quarter. Merck markets the branded version of Remicade outside the United States while Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) markets the rheumatoid arthritis drug within the country.Cubicin sales plunged 71% to $91 million in the quarter. The Zetia/Vytorin franchise recorded sales of $462 million, down 51% due to loss of exclusivity for both Zetia and Vytorin.Sales of Isentress and the Januvia/Janumet (diabetes) franchise also declined in the quarter. The Januvia/Janumet franchise recorded sales of $1.53 billion in the quarter, down 2% from the year-ago quarter due to continued pricing pressure.Isentress sales declined 17% in the quarter to 310 million. Lower volumes/demand due to competitive pressure hurt sales of Isentress.Gardasil/Gardasil 9 sales declined 22% to $675 million. The production shutdown following the cyber-attack resulted in supply constraints, which adversely impacted sales in the United States. However sales rose in Europe  boosted by the addition of sales from the terminated vaccine joint venture with Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report) and in Asia Pacific backed by strong demand.Merck’s Animal Health segment generated revenues of $1 billion, up 16% (up 14% excluding Fx impact) from the year-ago quarter, primarily driven by higher sales of companion animal products, primarily Bravecto, companion animal vaccines and contribution from the Vallée acquisition.Gross Margins & Costs Rise                                                   Adjusted gross margin came in at 76%, up 70 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter,, attributable to favorable effects of product mix, which offset the costs related to the cyber attack.Marketing and administrative (M&A) expenses increased 1% to $2.4 billion in the reported quarter. Research and development (R&D) spend increased 8% to $1.8 billion in the quarter.2017 GuidanceMerck raised its previously issued adjusted earnings guidance while raising its sales guidance marginally – for the second time this year. The company expects adjusted earnings in the range of $3.91–$3.97 compared with $3.76–$3.88 expected earlier. The adjusted earnings guidance includes less than 1% negative impact from currency fluctuation, comparing favorably with approximately 1% previously.Revenues are expected in the range of $40.0 billion – $40.5 billion compared with the earlier forecast of $39.4 billion – $40.4 billion, including negative currency impact of less than 1%  (versus approximately 1% previously).Operating expenses are still expected to increase year over year at a mid-single-digit rate. The increased costs are attributable to increased investments behind the ongoing launches, remediation expenses related to the cyber attack, as well as additional R&D costs associated with the new oncology collaboration with AstraZeneca.Our TakeMerck’s third-quarter results were mixed as the company beat estimates for earnings but missed the same for sales. Despite a relatively weaker sales performance, Merck raised its previously issued adjusted earnings guidance for 2017 and also upped its sales guidance marginally.Shares were down 2% in pre-market trading in response to lower sales of Merck’s multiple medicines. This year so far, Merck’s shares have underperformed the industry. Merck’s shares have risen 5.3% this year comparing unfavorably with a 16.1% increase for the industry.All eyes were on the performance of Keytruda, which is being touted as a key long-term growth driver for Merck. The drug continued its strong performance with sales crossing the $1 billion mark this quarter.However, the company has suffered some notable pipeline setbacks this year. Earlier this month, Merck decided not to seek approval for its CETP inhibitor anacetrapib for cholesterol management as its clinical profile was not strong enough to support regulatory filings. Last month, Merck discontinued development of two of its HCV programs saying that the HCV market is becoming extremely crowded. Also, three combination studies of Keytruda for multiple myeloma were placed on clinical hold following reports of death in the Keytruda groups in JulyMerck carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1122,LLY,"On Oct 18, 2017, we issued an updated report on ImmunoGen, Inc. (IMGN  -  Free Report).ImmunoGen is a development-stage biotechnology company, focused on developing targeted cancer therapeutics, using its proprietary antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) technology.ImmunoGen has made significant progress with regard to its lead pipeline candidate, mirvetuximab soravtansine. The candidate is currently in a phase III study (FORWARD I) as a single-agent therapy for treating patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, whose tumors express high or medium levels of FR alpha. Additionally, they have received up to three prior treatment regimens. Successful development and subsequent approval will be a huge boost to the company as ovarian cancer market represents a huge potential.Notably, combination regimens with mirvetuximab soravtansine in ovarian cancer are in the phase Ib/II FORWARD II study. The trial consists of cohorts assessing mirvetuximab soravtansine in combination with Roche’s Avastin and Merck’s Keytruda. ImmunoGen reported initial data from the FORWARD II study in May, demonstrating the candidate to have potential to complement currently available therapies for the indication.Notably, mirvetuximab soravtansine enjoys an Orphan Drug status in both the United States and the EU for treatment of ovarian cancer.Although the platinum-resistant ovarian cancer market provides immense commercial potential, ImmunoGen is set to face intense competition upon approval from established products like Roche’s Avastin and Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) Doxil. Also, several companies are working on to introduce treatments to the market, targeting this disease.Apart from mirvetuximab soravtansine, ImmunoGen is working to develop a couple of other candidates, including IMGN779 and IMGN632. Notably, IMGN779 is being evaluated in a phase I study for treating acute myeloid leukemia with data expected later this year. On the other hand, the company plans to move IMGN632 into clinical development before the year-end to treat hematological malignancies including acute myeloma leukemia (AML).ImmunoGen has agreements with several big healthcare companies including Amgen Inc., Bayer, Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report), Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report), Roche, Sanofi and Takeda. These contracts in turn allow other companies to use ImmunoGen’s ADC technology and provide it with funds in the form of license and milestone fees, royalties, clinical materials revenue and R&D (research and development) support fees.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

1123,LLY,"Radius Health, Inc. (RDUS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 2.  Radius’ share price has decreased 22% year to date compared with the industry’s 6.6% decline.Radius Health has a disappointing track record so far. The company reported wider-than-expected loss in three of the four trailing quarters with a negative average surprise of 6.9%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this quarter.Factors at PlayRadius focuses on the development of therapeutics for the treatment of osteoporosis, oncology and endocrine diseases.The company’s lead drug, Tymlos, was approved in the United States in April. The drug was approved for treating postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture defined as history of osteoporotic fracture and multiple risk factors for fracture. The drug can also be used for patients who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapies.The company reported sales of Tymlos of $1.0 million from the first four weeks of launch.  The company is moving ahead with its plans in contracting with managed care organizations with access to over 133 million covered lives across Commercial and Medicare Part D plans.Hence, we expect investors to focus on the uptake of the drug during the upcoming earnings call.Although the osteoporosis market in the United States has great potential as approximately 1.4 million postmenopausal women experience osteoporotic fractures each year, Tymlos is expected to face significant competition from Eli Lilly &Co's (LLY  -  Free Report) Forteo and Amgen. Inc’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) Prolia.Meanwhile, the company’s Marketing Authorisation Application for Eladynos (abaloparatide-SC) in Europe for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis was under review.  However, the company suffered a setback when the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency issued a second Day-180 List of Outstanding Issues and requested additional data analyses related to the safety and efficacy of abaloparatide-SC. Consequently, Radius is working with the CHMP to address these issues and the company expects a response for Eladynos prior to the end of 2017.In May, Radius Health announced positive top-line results from the completed 24-month ACTIVExtend clinical trial on Tymlos, which met all of its primary and secondary endpoints. The company expects to submit a sNDA to the FDA in connection with the ACTIVExtend results by year end.The FDA granted Fast Track designation to pipeline candidate elacestrant, an experimental selective estrogen receptor down-regulator/degrader for the treatment of women with ER+ and HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer. The elacestrant clinical development program is currently ongoing with two phase I studies in patients with ER+, HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer who have been heavily pre-treated (median of three prior lines of therapy) and have evaluable disease.Hence, we expect the management to throw light on pipeline progress.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Radius is likely to beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for Radius Health is currently pegged at 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at a loss of $1.28. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter..Zacks Rank: Radius Health has a Zacks Rank #3. Although the rank is favorable, the company’s 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult. Note that we caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stock to ConsiderHere is a pharma company that you may consider, as our model shows that it has the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Incyte Corporation (INCY  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +40.11% and a Zacks Rank #3.

1124,LLY,"AstraZeneca, plc (AZN  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has granted approval to a new indication for its breast cancer drug, Faslodex.The label of Faslodex will now be expanded to include combination use with Eli Lilly’s (LLY  -  Free Report) new CDK4/6 inhibitor Verzenio/abemaciclib to treat women with HR+, HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer whose disease has progressed after endocrine therapy.The FDA approval was based on the MONARCH 2 study data, which showed that Faslodex+Verzeniosignificantly improved progression-free survival (16.4 months) compared to Faslodex+ placebo.Shares of this London, United Kingdom based pharma giant have gained 22.2% so far this year, comparing favorably with the industry’s growth of 14%.In August, Faslodex had received FDA approval for a label extension in the first-line monotherapy setting for the treatment of postmenopausal women with HR+ advanced breast cancer. Until this approval, Faslodex was only approved for advanced breast cancer in later lines of treatment.We believe that the FDA approval for two new indications for Faslodex in three months can improve sales of the drug in the future quarters. The drug has generated sales of $703 million in 2017 so far, up 16% year over year.Also, please note that this is the second time that Faslodex has been approved for use in combination with a CDK4/6 inhibitor. It is already marketed in combination with Pfizer’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Ibrance.AstraZeneca carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1125,LLY,"With third quarter earnings season drawing to a close, the focus is back on deals, regulatory approvals and pipeline updates. This week, companies like AstraZeneca (AZN  -  Free Report) and Bayer (BAYRY  -  Free Report) were in the news with the former announcing the FDA approval of its severe asthma drug while Bayer signed a cancer-focused deal with Loxo Oncology.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesFDA Approval for AstraZeneca Severe Asthma Drug: AstraZeneca continues to deliver on its pipeline with the company scoring a couple of FDA nods this week. The regulatory body granted approval to the company’s respiratory biologic, Fasenra (benralizumab), for the add-on maintenance treatment of severe asthma patients (aged 12 years and above) whose disease is driven by eosinophilic inflammation (Read more: AstraZeneca's Asthma Drug Benralizumab Approved by FDA). Moreover, AstraZeneca got a positive opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”) of the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) for Fasenra (Read more: AstraZeneca Gets Positive CHMP Opinion for Asthma Candidate).AstraZeneca also gained FDA approval for the use of its cancer drug, Faslodex, in an expanded patient population. Faslodex can now be used in combination with Eli Lilly’s (LLY  -  Free Report) CDK4/6 inhibitor, Verzenio (abemaciclib), in women with HR+, HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer (“MBC”) whose disease has progressed after endocrine therapy. Study results had shown 16.4 months of progression-free survival (“PFS”) on the combination treatment.This marks the second FDA approval for Faslodex with a CDK4/6 inhibitor – the treatment is already approved for use in combination with Pfizer’s CDK4/6 inhibitor, Ibrance (palbociclib).FDA Advisory Panel Meeting for Pacira’s Exparel sNDA: Specialty pharma company, Pacira Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

1126,LLY,"Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) presented new data from a large CANVAS outcomes program on its type II diabetes drug, Invokana (SGLT2 inhibitor), demonstrating an improved renal outcome. The data was presented at the annual meeting of the American Heart Association Scientific Sessions in California and published in the Circulation.So far this year, Johnson & Johnson’s share price has increased 21.1%, comparing favorably with the 14.4% rally of the industry it belongs to.This new analysis of CANVAS showed a reduction in the risk of the composite renal endpoint in both patient groups — with a history of CV disease (secondary prevention) and those with only risk factors for CV disease (primary prevention). Also, Invokana demonstrated reduction in the risk of hospitalization due to heart failure (HHF) in both patient groups. No new adverse events were reported during this additional analysis.We remind investors that in June, the company reported data from the CANVAS program, which demonstrated that Invokana was successful in reducing the risks of cardiovascular (CV) outcomes in type II diabetes patients, who have established cardiovascular (CV) disease or are at a risk for CV disease. Invokana reduced major adverse CV events or MACE by 14% compared with placebo. MACE is a composite endpoint of CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke. However, the study also showed that the drug increased the risk of amputations.Last month, J&J submitted a supplemental new drug application (sNDA) to the FDA for the label expansion of Invokana to include the cardiovascular indication based on the data from the CANVAS program.Many pharma companies are working hard to get the labels of their diabetes medicines updated to include the cardiovascular benefits. With death from cardiovascular diseases being significantly higher in adults with diabetes compared with those without it, the addition of positive CV outcomes on labels of diabetes drugs can give sales a shot in the arm.Eli Lilly & Company (LLY  -  Free Report) received both FDA and EU approvals last year to include the CV risk reduction data from the EMPA-REG OUTCOME study on the label of Jardiance. Additionally, in August, Novo Nordisk’s (NVO  -  Free Report) Victoza (liraglutide) was approved by the FDA for a new indication to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular (CV) events in adults with type II diabetes and established CV disease.However, in May, Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) was denied an approval by the FDA to include cardiovascular outcomes data from the TECOS trial on the labels of its DPP-IV inhibitor, Januvia (sitagliptin) and other medicines containing Januvia.AstraZeneca’s Bydureon also failed to reduce the cardiovascular risk in a phase IIIb/IV cardiovascular outcomes study, EXSCEL.Johnson & Johnson Price Johnson & Johnson Price | Johnson & Johnson QuoteZacks RankJohnson & Johnson carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

1127,LLY,"Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (TEVA  -  Free Report) announced the submission of a biologics license application (“BLA”) to the FDA seeking approval for its monoclonal antibody candidate, fremanezumab, as a preventive treatment for migraine.The BLA submission was supported by positive data from two phase III studies under HALO program, which evaluated the candidate in patients with episodic migraine (""EM"") and chronic migraine (""CM"").Fremanezumab was subcutaneously administered once a month for two months (quarterly dose regimen), either in high (675mg) or low doses (225 mg, monthly dose regimen) in the study on CM patients. The data demonstrated statistically significant reduction in the number of monthly headache days when treated with fremanezumabcompared to a placebo. The study also met its secondary endpoints and showed significant improvement over placebo.Data from the study on EM patients showed that patients who were treated with monthly as well as quarterly dosing regimens of fremanezumab experienced clinically and statistically significant improvements in monthly average number of migraine days and 12 pre-specified analyses.Given the limited treatment options, fremanezumab represents significant commercial potential. According to Teva’s press release, more than a billion people suffer from migraine across the world including 38 million in the United States.We remind investors that the BLA from Amgen, Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) and partner Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) for approval of their CGRP receptor, erenumab, for the prevention of migraine was accepted by the FDA in July. Eli Lilly & Company (LLY  -  Free Report) is also planning to file for FDA approval of its investigational migraine drug, galcanezumab, in the second half of the year.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

1128,LLY,"Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) announced encouraging results on Revolade from the EXTEND study.The open-label extension study from four trials (TRA100773A, TRA100773B, TRA102537/RAISE and TRA108057/REPEAT) showed long-term disease control in chronic/persistent immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) patients. The research evaluated patients for up to 8 years of continuous treatment. The study found that majority of patients maintained a substantial clinical response and might not need concomitant ITP medications any further.Patients suffering from ITP have a low number of platelets which in turn does not let the blood to clot resulting in bruising and bleeding.  The study results showed that nearly 70% of patients maintain platelet counts without rescue therapy for prolonged periods, reducing the overall risk of bleeding.  In addition, more than one-third of patients permanently stopped one or more concomitant ITP medications (including corticosteroids, danazol, azathioprine). The results establish long-term safety profile and demonstrates treatment benefit with Revolade.We note that the drug is approved in the United States and Europe for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in pediatric patients 1 year or older with chronic ITP who have had an insufficient response to corticosteroids and immunoglobulins. It is marketed as Promacta in the United States.We remind investors that the drug was acquired from GlaxoSmithKline plc. (GSK  -  Free Report). Novartis has a collaboration agreement with Ligand Pharmaceuticals, Inc., (LGND  -  Free Report) for the marketing of the drug.Novartis is currently going through a transitional stage. In March 2015, Novartis acquired certain oncology products and pipeline compounds from Glaxo. In exchange, it sold its non-influenza Vaccines business to Glaxo. In January 2015, Novartis divested its Animal Health Division to Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) .The company’s blockbuster drug, Diovan, is facing stiff generic competition in the United States, EU and Japan. Gleevec lost exclusivity in the United States in February 2016. The company also lost patent protection for the drug in EU in December 2016 leading to generic competition. The loss of patent protection for these top-selling drugs continue to hurt sales.Nevertheless, Novartis has a strong oncology portfolio of drugs like Afinitor, Exjade, Jakavi, Zykadia, Tasigna, Jadenu, and Kisqali. The recent approval of Kymriah for acute lymphoblastic leukemia is a major boost for Novartis given the potential in the CAR T therapy space. Growth drivers like Cosentyx and Entresto, more than offset the impact of generic erosion, mainly due to Glivec.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

1129,LLY,"Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) was the first large-cap pharma stock to report its earnings results for this season on Oct 17. J&J beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both earnings and revenues in the third quarter and also raised its 2017 sales and profit outlook. Shares of J&J were up more than 3% on Tuesday.J&J’s sales growth accelerated in the third quarter leading the company to post its first positive sales surprise after almost a year. Higher sales in the pharmaceutical segment as well as positive contribution from the Actelion deal pulled up the top line in the quarter. J&J acquired Swiss biotech Actelion in June this year for $30 billion.Overall, the pharma sector has witnessed a great turnaround this year after the drug pricing issue crippled its performance last year.After declining 5.2% last year, the Large Cap Pharma industry has risen 18.2% this year so far, outpacing 14.2% gain for the S&P 500 in the same time frame.New product sales ramp up with rising demand, successful innovation and product line expansion, strong clinical study results, more frequent FDA approvals (11 new drugs approved in Q3 alone) and continued strong performance of legacy products have played a pivotal role in bringing the sector on track this year.These factors are likely to drive the sector through the rest of this year and probably the next despite challenges like rising competition, pipeline setbacks, slowdown in growth of mature products and generic competition for certain key drugs.J&J’s better-than-expected results, especially the strong performance of its Pharmaceuticals segment, have raised optimism for another strong quarterly performance by the pharma sector, mainly the large-cap companies.Let’s have a closer look at what to expect from six big pharma stocks when they report this month/early next month. Five out of the six companies are expected to deliver earnings beat this quarter.Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report)Pfizer is scheduled to announce third-quarter results on Oct 31 before the market opens. With a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and Earnings ESP of +1.04%, the chances of the stock beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the third quarter is high. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.New products like Xeljanz (rheumatoid arthritis) and Ibrance (breast cancer) as well as older products like Lyrica (neuropathic pain) and Eliquis (blood thinner) are expected to contribute to Pfizer’s top line meaningfully. However, the loss of exclusivity and associated generic competition for products like Pristiq Vfend, Zyvox and Celebrex and the expiration of a few co-promotion agreements will continue to hamper top-line growth. Blockbuster drug Enbrel sales will continue to be soft in the quarter due to biosimilar competition.Pfizer surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters, as shown in the chart below:Pfizer, Inc.

Keytruda sales in the United States are gaining, particularly from strong momentum in the new indication of first-line lung cancer. The Keytruda development program significantly advanced in the first half with regulatory approvals for four new indications in the United States and an additional indication in Europe. The new approvals expand the patient population and are expected to drive sales further.However, genericization and increasing competition will likely remain overhangs.Merck outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, as reflected in the chart below:Merck & Company, Inc.

Glaxo’s Pharmaceuticals segment is expected to continue being driven by strong sales of new HIV products, Tivicay and Triumeq.However, many of Glaxo’s key drugs like Lovaza and Avodart are facing declining sales due to generic competition. Moreover, sluggish sales growth in the Consumer Healthcare segment due to a slowdown in market conditions and the impact of divestures may negatively impact the top line in the third quarter.Notably, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, as shown in the chart below:GlaxoSmithKline PLC Price and EPS Surprise GlaxoSmithKline PLC Price and EPS Surprise | GlaxoSmithKline PLC QuoteEli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report)Eli Lillyis slated to announce third-quarter results on Oct 24 before the market opens.

Cosentyx has been strong and the company has grabbed market share from rivals like AbbVie’s Humira and Amgen’s Enbrel. Cosentyx achieved blockbuster status in 2016.However, a weak Alcon business and generic competition for several of its key drugs is expected to hurt revenues in this quarter.Notably, Novartis outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, as reflected in the chart below:Novartis AG Price and EPS Surprise Novartis AG Price and EPS Surprise | Novartis AG QuoteThe Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

1130,LLY,"Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) will report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 24, before the market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 6.73%.Lilly’s shares have risen 17% this year so far while the industry recorded an increase of 18.2%.Lilly’s performance has been mixed with earnings missing expectations in two of the last four quarters while beating the same in the other two, bringing the average negative surprise to 0.89%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this quarter.Factors to ConsiderNew products like Trulicity, Taltz and Jardiance have supported the top line in the past few quarters. We expect the trend to continue in the third quarter of 2017 as well. While Trulicity sales are expected to be driven by growth in the GLP-1 market and market share gains, Jardiance sales are likely to be driven by increased market share within the growing SGLT2 class. Newer products like Basaglar, Lartruvo and Taltz may continue to witness better sequential sales backed by strong launch uptake.However, sales of Alimta, Cymbalta and Zyprexa are expected to decline due to the loss of exclusivity. Cymbalta has lost exclusivity in Europe and Canada, Zyprexa in Japan and Alimta in several countries outside the United States. Meanwhile, lower demand in the United States due to competitive pressure mainly from immuno-oncology agents is hurting Alimta sales in the country. The consensus estimate for Alimta for the third quarter is $508 million.Another new drug Olumiant (baricitinib) has been launched in select European countries. In July, the drug was approved in Japan, which is likely to add to the top line in the third quarter. However, in the United States, the drug is under review. In August, Lilly and partner Incyte Corporation (INCY  -  Free Report) announced that they will re-submit the NDA for baricitinib much faster than previously expected. The NDA is expected to be re-submitted in January next year.Meanwhile, older products like Humulin, Trajenta and Forteo may continue to do well.Animal Health segment sales, in the past two quarters, have been hurt by global competitive pressure. At the Q2 conference call, management had said that the global competitive pressure will continue to hurt revenues in the segment through the rest of the year, though to a lesser extent. The consensus estimate for Animal Health segment for the third quarter is $715 million.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Lilly is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Its Earnings ESP is -0.14%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Lilly’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings beat.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Eli Lilly and Company Price and EPS Surprise Eli Lilly and Company Price and EPS Surprise | Eli Lilly and Company QuoteStocks to ConsiderStocks in the pharmaceuticals sector that have both a positive ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank includeBristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report), scheduled to release results on Oct 26, with an Earnings ESP of +2.35% and a Zacks Rank #3.

The company said that business development remains a top priority while it expects to buy back shares worth an additional $250 million by year end (Read more: Bristol-Myers Misses on Q3 Earnings, Opdivo in Focus). The company has gained 4.3% year to date, compared to the 16.1% rally of the industry it belongs to.Sanofi Files Patent Infringement Lawsuit against Mylan for Lantus: French drugmaker, Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report) has filed a patent infringement suit against Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report) for Lantus and Lantus SoloStar. The lawsuit, filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleges infringement of 18 patents. Although Sanofi’s diabetes product sales are under immense pressure, the Lantus franchise remains a major contributor to the top-line. Earlier this year in August, Sanofi had filed a patent infringement suit against Merck alleging infringement of two patents related to Lantus products.Interest Increases in Pfizer’s Consumer Healthcare Business: Ever since Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) announced that it is exploring strategic options for its Consumer Healthcare business, including a full or partial separation via a spin off or sale, quite a few companies have been rumored to be interested in striking a deal. This week, British pharma major, Glaxo, was asked on its third quarter call about its interest in acquiring Pfizer’s Consumer Healthcare business.  Glaxo’s own Consumer segment has been witnessing a material slowdown in global growth across key categories with factors like pricing pressure, increasing competition and tougher emerging markets weighing on performance (Read more: Glaxo Q3 Earnings Beat, Revenues In Line, Shares Down).Meanwhile, according to a Reuters article, Pfizer expects to start the auction process for its consumer healthcare business in November. According to sources, possible bidders apart from Glaxo and Reckitt Benckiser could include names like Procter & Gamble, Sanofi, Johnson & Johnson and Nestle.PerformanceThe NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index declined 3.7% this week. Among major stocks, Glaxo declined 10.9% mainly reflecting concerns about the company’s dividend payouts especially if it strikes a deal for Pfizer’s Consumer Healthcare business.

1132,LLY,"The biotech industry has witnessed a great turnaround this year after the drug pricing issue crippled its performance last year. After declining 5.2% last year, the Large Cap Pharma industry has risen 18.9% so far this year, outpacing 14% gain for the S&P 500 in the same time frame.The NASDAQ Biotechnology Index is up almost 28% year to date after sliding 19.1% in 2016. The NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index has risen 15.4% year to date (YTD) after declining almost 10% last year.The pharma/biotech sector has a number of things going in its favor. Strong quarterly results, new product sales ramp up with rising demand, successful innovation and product line expansion, strong clinical study results, more frequent FDA approvals (11 new drugs approved in Q3 alone) and continued strong performance from legacy products have played a pivotal role in bringing the sector on track this year. Another factor that has contributed to the sector’s surge is that President Trump's expected action on drug prices may not be as onerous as previously feared.These factors are likely to drive the sector through the rest of this year and probably the next despite challenges like rising competition, pipeline setbacks, slowdown in growth of mature products and generic competition for certain key drugs.On the broader macro front, the proposed tax reforms, if approved, will leave more cash in the hands of these companies. The cash can be invested for mergers/acquisitions, which have been relatively fewer this year compared with the last.Meanwhile, the outlook for the upcoming third quarter results looks bright. Per the Earnings Trends article, the broader Medical sector (includes drug, biotech as well as Medical Device companies) is expected to record year-over-year growth of 4.7% in revenues and 0.8% in earnings in Q3.How to Pick Likely Q3 WinnersGiven the enormity of the healthcare space, selecting stocks that have the potential to beat estimates could appear to be quite daunting. But our proprietary methodology makes it fairly simple. One way to narrow down the list of choices this earnings season is by looking at stocks that have the combination of a favorable Zacks Rank – Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) – and a positive Earnings ESP. More often than not, a positive earnings surprise delivered by a company leads to stock price appreciation.Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks that have high chances of delivering a positive surprise in their upcoming earnings announcement. It shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Our research shows that for stocks with this combination, the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70%.  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Here are five large-cap pharma stocks that are poised to beat estimates in the third quarter according to our methodology.

With this latest failure, Lilly joins the list of large pharma companies who have failed in their respective lung cancer pivotal studies in the recent past. However, Verzenio was granted priority review status as first-line treatment for breast cancer.Meanwhile, the FDA granted Breakthrough therapy designation to AstraZeneca PLC’s (AZN  -  Free Report) Tagrisso for EGFR mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer (“NSCLC”) as well as Astellas’ leukemia candidate, gilteritinib. Also, AbbVie and Seattle Genetics announced collaboration agreements to strengthen their oncology pipeline.Let’s see the news in details.Key NewsEli Lilly and Company faced yet another pipeline setback as its phase III JUNIPER study failed to meet the primary endpoint of overall survival.

1134,LLY,"Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has granted priority review to its new drug application (NDA) for Verzenio (abemaciclib). This drug is looking forward to get approved for the first-line treatment of advanced breast cancer.Markedly, the NDA was based upon the positive interim results from MONARCH 3 study. The study compared abemaciclib in combination with an aromatase inhibitor versus an aromatase inhibitor alone as initial endocrine-based therapy in patients with HR+, HER2- advanced breast cancer. A decision from the FDA is expected by June 2018.So far this year, Lilly’s shares have underperformed the industry. While the stock has been up 17.5%, the industry gained 18.9%. Generally, Priority Review designation from the FDA is granted to drugs that have the potential to provide significant improvements in the safety and effectiveness of the treatment, prevention or diagnosis of a serious disease.Verzenio, a CDK 4/6 inhibitor, is one such drug that was approved by the FDA last week for two breast cancer indications. The drug got approved as a monotherapy for the treatment of hormone-receptor-positive (HR+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) advanced breast cancer, who had prior endocrine therapy and chemotherapy for metastatic disease and as a combination therapy with fulvestrant in HR+, HER2- advanced breast cancer patients, who had disease progression following endocrine therapy. While the monotherapy submission was based on data from the MONARCH 1 study, the combination application was based on data from the MONARCH 2 study.We remind the investors that Novartis AG’s (NVS  -  Free Report) Kisqali, is already approved by the FDA. The drug is used in combination with an aromatase inhibitor for the first-line treatment of postmenopausal women with HR+/HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer.Also, AstraZeneca, plc’s (AZN  -  Free Report) breast cancer drug, Faslodex, received the FDA approval in August for a label extension in the first-line monotherapy setting for advanced breast cancer.Eli Lilly and Company Price Eli Lilly and Company Price | Eli Lilly and Company QuoteZacks Rank & Stock to ConsiderLilly carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1135,LLY,"Companies like Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report), Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) and Eli Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) were in the news this week – while Pfizer is mulling strategic options for its Consumer Healthcare business, Merck said that it will not file its CETP inhibitor.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesPfizer to Divest Consumer Healthcare Segment? Pfizer is currently reviewing different strategic options for its Consumer Healthcare business which includes a full or partial separation via a spin off or sale. The company could also ultimately decide to retain the business. This is not the first time that Pfizer has decided to spin off or sell a non-core business segment. Some of the strategic steps taken by Pfizer include the sale of the Hospira infusion systems business to ICU Medical (February 2017), the spin-off of the animal health business that led to the creation of Zoetis (2013) as well as the divestment of the nutrition business to Nestle in 2012. Before that, Pfizer had sold off its Capsugel business to an affiliate of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.The divestment of the Consumer Healthcare business would help Pfizer focus on its Innovative Health segment and would also bring in funds that the company could use for returning value to shareholders in the form of share buybacks and dividends (Read more: Pfizer Considering Sale/Spin-Off of Consumer Healthcare Unit).Pfizer is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock - you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. The company has gained 11.9% year to date, compared to the 18.9% rally of the industry it belongs to.Merck Collaborates with KalVista: Clinical-stage pharma company, KalVista Pharmaceuticals saw its shares shoot up 38.6% on a collaboration agreement with Merck for KVD001 and future oral diabetic macular edema (“DME”) compounds based on plasma kallikrein inhibition.KVD001, an investigational intravitreal (IVT) injection, is scheduled to move into a phase II proof-of-concept study later this year. Merck has the option to acquire rights to the candidate following the completion of the study. Merck has a similar option for certain other DME candidates.KalVista will receive a non-refundable upfront payment of $37 million as well as payments associated with the exercise of the options by Merck and the achievement of milestones for each program that could add up to $715 million. The company also stands to receive tiered royalties on net sales for candidates commercialized under the deal. Merck also acquired a 9.9% ownership stake in KalVista worth $9.1 million. Another Pipeline Setback for Lilly: Lilly suffered a setback with its recently approved breast cancer drug, Verzenio, failing to meet the primary endpoint in a late-stage study in KRAS-mutated, advanced non-small cell lung cancer.  While the CDK4 and 6 inhibitor failed to meet the primary endpoint of overall survival (“OS”), an analysis of the secondary endpoints of progression-free survival (“PFS”) and overall response rate (“ORR”) showed evidence of monotherapy activity (Read more: Lilly's Verzenio Fails in Phase III Lung Cancer Study).Meanwhile, Verzenio has been granted priority review by the FDA for use in the initial treatment of advanced breast cancer. This means a response from the agency should be out within eight months of receiving the regulatory application instead of the usual timeframe of 12 months.J&J Seeks FDA Nod for New Prostate Cancer Treatment: Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen Biotech is seeking FDA approval for apalutamide, an investigational, next generation oral androgen receptor (“AR”) inhibitor for men with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (“CRPC”). There is significant unmet need for this patient population given the absence of FDA approved treatments for these patients.Prostate cancer, the most common cancer among American men, is expected to be diagnosed in more than 161,000 men in 2017, as per the American Cancer Society.Apalutamide became a part of J&J’s pipeline following its 2013 acquisition of privately-held Aragon Pharmaceuticals. Apalutamide’s approval would strengthen and expand J&J’s presence in the prostate cancer market – the company currently sells Zytiga, which is approved for use in combination with prednisone for the treatment of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (“mCRPC”). J&J is looking to expand Zytiga’s label into earlier stages of metastatic prostate cancer.Allergan Settles Restasis Litigation with InnoPharma: Allergan (AGN  -  Free Report) entered into a settlement agreement with InnoPharma related to litigation regarding Restasis patents. The challenged patents are listed in the Orange Book and are scheduled to expire on Aug 27, 2024.Under the settlement agreement, InnoPharma can start selling a generic version of the eye drug in the United States from Feb 24, 2024 or earlier under certain circumstances. Moreover, under certain circumstances, InnoPharma will be allowed to launch an authorized generic version of Restasis on Aug 28, 2024.Allergan is adopting different ways of protecting Restasis from generic competition. The company recently came under fire for entering into an agreement with the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe, with lawmakers questioning the unconventional move adopted by the company to protect the blockbuster eye drug from generic competition. Restasis is Allergan’s second best-selling drug bringing in sales of almost $1.5 billion in 2016. Lawmakers pointed out that the sovereign status of Native American tribes would make any patent challenges lengthy and complex as tribes may be immune from the legal claims made by generic drug makers to challenge patents. In fact, the Tribe is filing to dismiss the ongoing inter partes review (“IPR”) of the Restasis patents based on their sovereign immunity from IPR challenges.The deal with the Tribe has basically raised concerns that it will curb generic competition in the pharmaceutical industry and discourage generic drugmakers from making cheaper copy-cat versions of expensive drugs. Allergan has been asked by the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform to provide certain documents and information about the deal by Oct 17, 2017.Merck Will Not File Anacetrapib: Merck has decided that it will not seek regulatory approval for its investigational CETP inhibitor, anacetrapib. The company’s decision was based on a thorough review of the clinical profile of the drug. We note that Merck is not the first company to drop a CETP inhibitor from its plans.

1136,LLY,"World Diabetes Day is celebrated every year on November 14. The theme this year is ‘Women and diabetes - our right to a healthy future’. The focus is on emphasizing the importance of providing women (diabetics as well as those at risk of being diagnosed with diabetes) with affordable and equitable access to essential diabetes drugs and technologies, self-management education and information needed to achieve optimal diabetes outcomes and strengthen their capacity to prevent type II diabetes. The ninth leading cause of death in women across the world, diabetes accounts for 2.1 million deaths every year.According to information provided by the International Diabetes Foundation (""IDF""), more than 199 million women have diabetes with this figure expected to rise to 313 million by 2040. Among these, more than 60 million women are of reproductive age with one in seven births being affected by gestational diabetes. Gestational diabetes is associated with a higher risk of type II diabetes in the mother as well as the child.Moreover, many people with type II diabetes remain unaware of their condition for a long period of time and this may lead to diabetes-related complications by the time the disease is diagnosed. Women with type II diabetes are considered to be 10 times more likely to suffer from heart disease compared to women without the condition.Other diabetes-related complications include blindness, lower-limb amputation and kidney failure.Given these statistics and complications, it is not surprising that several healthcare companies devote a significant amount of R&D dollars on developing treatments and devices for diabetes and diabetes management. The diabetes market is highly crowded with companies coming out with innovative treatments promising higher efficacy with lower side effects. Currently available diabetes drugs include different classes of treatments like DPP-4 inhibitors (Januvia, Onglyza, Trajenta), GLP-1 receptor agonists (Victoza) and SGLT-2 (Invokana, Farxiga) apart from metformin and insulin.In addition to drugs, the diabetes care market includes glucose monitoring systems, insulin delivery systems as well as insulin pumps.Stocks to Watch on World Diabetes DayThis World Diabetes Day, here is a look at some of the key pharma companies in the diabetes market.Denmark-based Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO  -  Free Report) is among the key players in the global diabetes market. The company’s diabetes portfolio comprises products like Tresiba (a once-daily new-generation insulin), Xultophy (a once-daily single-injection combination of Tresiba and Victoza), Ryzodeg (a soluble formulation of Tresiba and NovoLog), Fiasp (fast-acting mealtime insulin - a new formulation of NovoLog) and Victoza (GLP-1).Recent developments include Victoza and Tresiba’s label updates (Victoza’s U.S. label now reflects prevention of cardiovascular events while Tresiba’s EU label reflects significant reduction in the risk of severe hypoglycemia) as well as a positive FDA advisory panel vote for semaglutide. Approval could come later this quarter.However, pricing pressure in the United States remains a major challenge for the diabetes care market while intense competition across the globe also remains a headwind.Shares of Novo Nordisk have gained 38.8% year to date, significantly outperforming the industry’s 14.5% rally. Novo Nordisk is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock - you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) Rank stocks here.French drugmaker Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report) is another key player in the diabetes market. However, the company’s Diabetes franchise is under pressure with key product, Lantus, facing increasing competitive pressure at the payor level and biosimilar competition in several European markets. Toujeo, Apidra, Amaryl, Lyxumia and Soliqua are some of the other diabetes products in the company’s portfolio. Sanofi expects its global Diabetes sales to decline 6–8% annually (at constant exchange rates) over the 2015–2018 timeframe. Pricing pressure, increasing competition and formulary exclusions will continue impacting the segment.Despite the challenges in the diabetes market, Sanofi continues to work on expanding and strengthening its diabetes portfolio and currently has five diabetes candidates in its pipeline including SAR438335 (GLP-1R/GIPR dual agonist; phase I for type II diabetes), SAR425899 (GLP-1R/GCGR dual agonist; phase II for type II diabetes), sotagliflozin (oral SGLT-1&2 inhibitor; phase III for type I and type II diabetes), SAR341402 (rapid acting insulin; phase III for type I and II diabetes) and efpeglenatide (long-acting GLP-1 receptor agonist; phase III for type II diabetes scheduled to commence this quarter). Late-stage combination studies for sotagliflozin in type II diabetes are scheduled to commence this quarter.Shares of Sanofi are up 10.4% year to date, compared to the industry’s 14.5% rally.Diabetes (New Cardiovascular & Metabolic Diseases) is one of the growth platforms at AstraZeneca plc (AZN  -  Free Report). Key products in AstraZeneca’s diabetes portfolio include Farxiga, Onglyza, and Bydureon among others. Recent approvals include an improved device for Bydureon, Bydureon BCise, and a combination of Farxiga and Bydureon for type II diabetes.AstraZeneca’s Diabetes franchise sales in the United States are also feeling the impact of intense pricing pressure and competition.Shares of AstraZeneca, a Zacks Rank #3 stock, are up 20.5% year to date, compared to the industry’s 14.5% rally.Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) is another well-known player in the diabetes market. Lilly has a strong portfolio of diabetes treatments including Trulicity (GLP-1), Jardiance (SGLT-2), Trajenta, Humulin, Basaglar, Humalog, and Glyxambi. The company has a diabetes alliance with Boehringer Ingelheim for several of these products. Lilly also has a strong diabetes pipeline. While the company expects pricing pressure to continue in the diabetes market in 2018, the exclusion of Jardiance from the CVS health formulary could also impact the company’s diabetes franchise sales.Shares of Lilly are up 12.7% year to date, compared to the industry’s 14.5% rally. Lilly is also a Zacks Rank #3 stock.Merck & Co., Inc.’s (MRK  -  Free Report) diabetes franchise, which accounted for 16.7% of third quarter 2017 pharma segment sales, consists of products like Januvia and Janumet. However, like its peers, Merck’s diabetes segment sales continue to be affected by pricing pressure.Merck, along with partner Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report), is currently seeking FDA approval for ertugliflozin and two fixed-dose combination products (ertugliflozin and Januvia, ertugliflozin and metformin) with a response from the FDA expected in December 2017.Merck is also a Zacks Rank #3 stock. The company’s shares have declined 6.4% year to date, compared to the industry’s 14.5% rally.Although the diabetes market is currently facing intense pricing pressure and competition, the market remains lucrative considering the growing prevalence of the disease and the demand for new and better treatments.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation.See Them Free>>

1137,LLY,"Earnings remained in focus this week with companies like AstraZeneca (AZN  -  Free Report) reporting third quarter results. Meanwhile, companies like Roche (RHHBY  -  Free Report) and Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) were in the news due to regulatory updates.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesMixed Results from AstraZeneca: AstraZeneca’s third quarter results were mixed with the company missing on earnings but beating on revenues. The company has several pipeline events lined up in the coming quarters including data on cancer drugs like Lynparza and Imfinzi as well as regulatory submissions for moxetumomab pasudotox (leukemia) and selumetinib (thyroid cancer) among others (Read more: AstraZeneca Misses Q3 Earnings, Tweaks 2017 EPS View).FDA Nod for Merck CMV Drug: Merck gained FDA approval for Prevymis (letermovir) for the prevention of cytomegalovirus (“CMV”) infection and disease in adult allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (“HSCT”) patients. A common and potentially serious viral infection in allogeneic HSCT recipients, any level of CMV infection is associated with increased mortality in HSCT patients. Merck said that Prevymis is the first new CMV medicine to be approved in the United States in 15 years.Merck intends to launch the drug in December at a list price of $195 per day for the tablets and $270 for the injection. Merck is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock - you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Sanofi Signs MS Deal worth up to $805M: Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report) has entered into an agreement with Principia Biopharma Inc. for the latter’s clinical-stage, blood brain barrier crossing, oral BTK inhibitor, PRN2246, which has the potential to be developed for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (“MS”) and other central nervous system (“CNS”) diseases. Sanofi is willing to shell out up to $805 million including an upfront payment of $40 million. The balance will be payable on the achievement of milestones. Principia will also earn royalties on product sales. Moreover, the company has the option to co-fund late-stage development costs in exchange for either higher royalties on global sales or a profit and loss sharing arrangement in the United States. Sanofi already has a presence in the MS market in the form of Lemtrada and Aubagio.Glaxo Files for Nucala Label Expansion in the United States: GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK  -  Free Report) is looking to expand the label of its IL-5 antagonist, Nucala (mepolizumab), which is currently approved by the FDA as an add-on maintenance treatment for patients with severe asthma aged 12 years and older, and with an eosinophilic phenotype.Glaxo is now seeking FDA approval for the drug to be used as an add-on to maintenance treatment for patients who have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (“COPD”) with an eosinophilic phenotype.According to information provided by the company, COPD is estimated to affect 384 million people across the world and is currently the fourth leading cause of death in the world. However, given its prevalence, it could become the third leading cause of death by 2020.Glaxo has also filed for FDA approval of Nucala for the treatment of adult patients with eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (“EGPA”).Roche Lung Cancer Drug Gets FDA Nod for First-Line Setting: Roche gained FDA approval for its lung cancer drug, Alecensa (alectinib), for the first-line treatment of people with a specific type of lung cancer. The label expansion was based on phase III data which showed that Alecensa significantly extended the time that people lived without their disease worsening compared to Xalkori (crizotinib). The risk of the cancer spreading to or growing in the brain or central nervous system was also significantly lower in the Alecensa arm. This approval expands the patient population for Alecensa significantly with the treatment previously being approved in the second-line setting.Roche also gained FDA approval for its melanoma drug, Zelboraf, for the treatment of Erdheim-Chester disease (“ECD”), a rare blood disease.Roche has gained 1.1% year to date, compared to the 15.9% rally of the industry it belongs to.PerformanceLarge Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % Return Large Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % ReturnThe NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index declined marginally (0.2%) this week.

1138,LLY,"Total earnings for 95.3% of the total healthcare market capitalization are up 7.6% on revenue growth of 4.6%. Though earnings growth appears solid compared with many other sectors, earnings and revenue beat ratios of 72.5% and 58.8%, respectively, look disappointing.Among the most notable players, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) was the first major drug company to report earnings on Oct 17, followed by Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) on Oct 24 and Oct 26, respectively. Two other major U.S. drug companies, Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) and Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report), reported on Oct 27 and Oct 31, respectively. These industry primes posted solid results with either earnings or revenue beats or both.Johnson and Johnson Earnings in FocusThe world's biggest maker of healthcare products continued its long streak of earnings beat. Earnings per share came in at $1.90, 10 cents ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate and 13.1% higher than the year-ago quarter. Revenues grew 10.3% year over year to $19.65 billion and edged past the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $19.28 billion. Johnson & Johnson raised its full-year earnings per share guidance to $7.25-$7.30 from $7.12-$7.22 and revenue guidance to $76.1-$76.5 billion from $75.8-$76.1 billion (read: Healthcare ETFs in Focus on Johnson & Johnson Q3 Earnings).Pfizer Earnings in FocusThe U.S. drug giant came up with an earnings beat and in-line revenues. Earnings per share of 67 cents came in a couple of cents above the Zacks Consensus Estimate while revenues of $13.7 billion were in line with the estimate of $13.17 billion. On a year-over-year basis, earnings per share and revenues rose 10% and 1%, respectively. For 2017, Pfizer narrowed the revenue guidance range to $52.4-$53.1 billion from $52-$54 billion while raised the earnings per share guidance range to $2.58-$2.62 from $2.54-$2.60.Merck Earnings in FocusMerck beat the earnings estimate while missed on revenues. Earnings per share came in at $1.11, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.03 and improving 3.7% from the year-ago quarter. Revenues declined 2% year over year to $10.33 billion and were below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10.51 billion. Merck raised its revenue guidance to $40-$40.5 billion from $39.4-$40.4 billion and earnings per share guidance to $3.91-$3.97 from $3.76-$3.88 for this year.Bristol-Myers Earnings in FocusBristol-Myers missed on earnings while beats on revenues. It reported earnings per share of 75 cents, a couple of cents below the estimate. Revenues grew 7.1% to $5.25 billion and edged past the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.19 billion. The company raised its earnings per share guidance to $2.95-$3.05 from $2.90-$3.00 (see: all the Healthcare ETFs here).Eli Lilly Earnings in FocusEli Lilly topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both fronts. Earnings of $1.05 outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by couple of cents and came in 19% higher than the year-ago quarter. Revenues grew 9% to $5.66 billion and beat the $5.52-billion estimate. Like other drug makers, Eli Lilly also raised its 2017 revenue and earnings guidance. It now expects revenues in the range of $22.4-$22.7 billion compared with the previous expectation of $22.0-$22.5 billion and earnings per share in the range of $4.15-$4.25 versus $4.10-$4.20 expected previously.ETF AngleThe string of earnings beat failed to boost pharma ETFs as they saw rough trading over the past one month.

1139,LLY,"Celldex Therapeutics, Inc. (CLDX  -  Free Report) incurred third-quarter 2017 loss (adjusted for one-time items) of 14 cents per share, which was narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 24 cents as well as the year-ago loss of 29 cents per share. Lower costs and higher revenues led to the narrower loss in the quarter.Total revenue in the quarter rose 77.3% year over year to $3.9 million, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.17 million. The manufacturing service agreement with the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative led to higher revenues in the quarter.Shares of the biotech company rose 10% in after-hours trading on Tuesday.However, the stock has not done too well this year so far. It has declined 26% year to date against the 3.3% increase registered by the industry.Research and development expenses declined 12.4% from the year-ago period to $21.9 million due to lower varlilumab contract manufacturing and clinical studies expenses. General and administrative spend declined 4.3% to $5.3 million due to lower commercial planning costs and stock-based compensation expenses.As of Sep 30, 2017, Celldex had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $140.5 million compared with $154.0 million as of Jun 30, 2017. Celldex expects that this cash plus $11.3 million in net proceeds raised from sales of its common stock this month under the agreement with Cantor will be enough to fund working capital requirements and planned operations through 2018.Pipeline UpdateCelldex’s most advanced pipeline candidate is antibody drug conjugate, glembatumumab vedotin, currently being evaluated for the treatment of triple negative breast cancer (phase IIb—METRIC study) and metastatic melanoma (phase II). Enrolment in the key METRIC study closed this August, with data expected in the second quarter of 2018. In the melanoma study, Celldex added two new cohorts, a glembatumumab plus varlilumab arm and a glembatumumab plus checkpoint inhibitor arm, including either Bristol-Myers’ (BMY  -  Free Report) Opdivo or Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda.Apart from glembatumumab vedotin, other promising candidates in its pipeline, include varlilumab and CDX-014 (phase I—advanced renal cell carcinoma) among others.Varlilumab is being evaluated in combination with Opdivo in a phase II study that includes cohorts in five indications—colorectal cancer, ovarian cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma and glioblastoma. Celldex plans to complete enrolment across all cohorts in the phase II portion of the study in the first quarter of 2018.Along with the earnings release, Celldex announced data from a phase II study evaluating a combination of glembatumumab vedotin and varlilumab in melanoma patients who have progressed on checkpoint inhibitors. Of the 31 eligible patients only one had a confirmed partial response. Another two patients had partial response at a single timepoint. The median progression-free survival was 2.6 months, with 52% of patients having stable disease for six weeks or more. The full data set will be presented at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) annual meeting this week.With the Kolltan acquisition in Nov 2016, Celldex gained rights to two of Kolltan’s cancer pipeline candidates, CDX-0158 and CDX-3379. While CDX-0158 is being evaluated in a phase I study for refractory gastrointestinal stromal tumors/GIST and other KIT positive tumors, a phase II study on CDX-3379 in patients with recurrent/metastatic head and neck squamous cell cancer who are refractory to Eli Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report)/Bristol-Myers’ Erbitux is expected to be initiated by year end.Celldex carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1140,LLY,"Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) announced that its anti-PD-1 therapy, Keytruda has received approval from the European Commission (EC) for the first and second line treatment of certain patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma, a type of bladder cancer.Keytruda has been approved as a first-line therapy for patients who cannot receive standard of care chemotherapy containing cisplatin. Keytruda was also approved as a second-line treatment for patients who have been previously treated with platinum-containing chemotherapyThe approval was expected in July as the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) had granted a positive opinion, recommending approval of Keytruda.In the United States, Keytruda received accelerated approval for advanced bladder cancer indication in May this year.The approvals were based on data from the phase II KEYNOTE-052 trial and the phase III KEYNOTE-045 trial. Data from these studies have shown a clinically meaningful and improved overall survival benefit of Keytruda versus chemotherapy in this difficult-to-treat population.Keytruda is presently approved for many types of cancers and treatment settings including lung cancer, melanoma, head and neck cancer, classical hodgkin lymphoma and bladder cancer.Keytruda brought in sales of $881 million in second-quarter 2017, up 51% sequentially and 180% year over year. Sales continue to be driven by launch of new indications globally. Keytruda sales in the U.S. gained particularly from strong momentum in the new indication of first-line lung cancer. Outside U.S, Keytruda sales were primarily driven by the melanoma indication.Meanwhile, the Keytruda development program also significantly advanced in the first half with regulatory approvals for four new indications in the U.S. and an additional indication in Europe. Important approvals include that for advanced bladder cancer, advanced microsatellite instability-high cancers and first approval as a combination therapy with Eli Lilly & Company’s (LLY  -  Free Report) cancer drug Alimta (pemetrexed) and carboplatin (pem/carbo),), a commonly used chemo regimen, in lung cancer. Further Keytruda data readouts are pending in the second half.Keytruda is continuously growing and expanding into new indications and markets globally. Keytruda is being studied for more than 30 types of cancer in more than 550 studies, including more than 300 combination studies. Merck is collaborating with several companies including Amgen, Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report), Incyte, Glaxo and Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) separately for the evaluation of Keytruda in combination with other regimens.Merck’s shares have risen 8% this year so far against a 12% increase for the industry.Merck carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1141,LLY,"Radius Health, Inc. (RDUS  -  Free Report) posted a loss of $1.31 per share in the third quarter of 2017, wider than the loss of $1.07 per share in the year-ago quarter and the Zacks Consensus Estimate loss of $1.24. The year-over-year increase in net loss was attributable to an increase in general and administrative expenses.Radius Health, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Radius Health, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Radius Health, Inc. QuoteRadius Health’ share price had decreased 18.6% in the last six months compared with the industry’s fall of 2.6%.The company reported sales of Tymlos (abaloparatide) of $3.5 million while license revenues came in at $10 million. However, total revenues of 13.47 million missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $17.48 million.  Quarter in DetailResearch and development expenses for the reported quarter were $21 million, down 23.5% year over year due to a decrease in vasomotor project related spending, a $2.0 million decline in abaloparatide-SC project costs, and a $1.1 million fall in elacestrant (RAD1901) oncology project costs.General and administrative expenses for the reported quarter jumped to $47.7 million from $19.2 million.This increase was primarily the result of an increase of approximately $10.1 million in professional fees and support costs, including the costs associated with increasing headcount and preparing for the commercialization of Tymlos in the United States.Higher compensation expenses, including stock-based compensation, due to an increase in headcount were also responsible for increased costs.Pipeline UpdatesThe FDA approved Tymlos (abaloparatide) injection for the treatment of postmenopausal women with high risk osteoporosis for fracture.The company is developing two formulations of abaloparatide-SC and abaloparatide-transdermal. In May, Radius Health announced positive top-line results from the completed 24-month ACTIVExtend clinical trial on Tymlos, which met all of primary and secondary endpoints. The company expects to submit a sNDA to the FDA in connection with the ACTIVExtend results by year end. The company also plans to initiate a clinical trial in men with osteoporosis, which, if successful, will form the basis of an sNDA seeking to expand the label to treat men with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture. The study is expected to be initiated in the first quarter of 2018.Meanwhile, Radius Health’ Marketing Authorisation Application for Eladynos (abaloparatide-SC) for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis in Europe is under review by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency. The company however suffered a setback when the CHMP issued a second Day-180 List of Outstanding Issues. Consequently, Radius Health is working with the CHMP to address these issues and the company expects a response prior to the end of 2017.The company scheduled a meeting with the FDA in January 2018 to align on a regulatory pathway for a pivotal study for abaloparatide-TD.Meanwhile, the company discussed the regulatory pathway for elacestrant for breast cancer. In the meeting, the FDA indicated that, depending on the study results, which must demonstrate an improvement over the available therapies, the planned single-arm phase 2 trial could be considered a pivotal study for accelerated approval. However, a confirmatory study must be ongoing at the time of the NDA submission. Radius Health will provide further study details when the phase 2 study is initiated (expected in early 2018). The FDA also granted Fast Track designation to elacestrant in October 2017.  The candidate is also being evaluated at low doses as an estrogen receptor ligand for the potential relief of the frequency and severity of moderate to severe hot flashes in postmenopausal women with vasomotor symptoms. An update will be provided by 2017-end.Our TakeThe company’s wider-than-expected loss in the third quarter was disappointing as expenses continue to increase with the commercialization of Tymlos. A potential label expansion of the drug will further boost performance.Although the osteoporosis market in the United Sates has great potential as approximately 1.4 million postmenopausal women experience an osteoporotic fractur each year, Tymlos is expected to face significant competition from Eli Lilly &Co's (LLY  -  Free Report) Forteo and Amgen Inc's (AMGN  -  Free Report) Prolia. Moreover, the approved label carries a boxed warning of osteosarcoma (a malignant bone tumor).

1142,LLY,"Incyte Corporation (INCY  -  Free Report) reported strong results for the third quarter of 2017, wherein both earnings and sales topped estimates.Incyte reported earnings of 17 cents per share beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 6 cents but lower than the year-ago quarter reported figure of 19 cents.Quarterly revenues were $381.5 million, up 41.6% year over year and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $360.2 million. The top line was driven by higher sales of Jakafi in the United States and Iclusig in Europe as well as royalties from sales of Jakavi and Olumiant outside the United States. Incyte’s shares have moved up 13% in the year so far, compared with the industry’s 4.8% gain.Quarter in DetailJakafi sales grew 36%, year over year to $304 million driven by strong patient demand for both indications. Net product revenue of Iclusig amounted to $18 million, up from $13 million in the year-ago quarter. Product royalty revenues from Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) for the commercialization of Jakafi in ex-U.S. markets grew 36.7% to $41 million.Research and development (R&D) expenses were up to $270 million from $143 million in the year-ago quarter. The increase was primarily due to the expansion of the portfolio as well as upfront and milestone expenses of $209 million related to collaboration and license agreements. Selling, general and administration (SG&A) expenses amounted to $91 million, up 19.7% year over year.2017 Outlook UpdatedBased on strong performance so far in 2017, the company upped guidance for Jakafi and now expects revenues in the range of $1,125-$1,135 million, up from the earlier projected range of $1,090-$1,120 million. Iclusig revenues are still expected in the range of $60-$65 million.R&D expenses are now expected in the range of $1,250-1,300 million, up from the earlier forecast of $1,050-1,150 billion due to the acceleration of the phase III plans for epacadostat. SG&A expenses are still expected in the range of $340-$360 million.Incyte Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Incyte Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Incyte Corporation QuotePipeline UpdateResults from a phase III trial, REACH3 evaluating Jakafi as a treatment for patients with steroid-refractory chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is expected in the first half of 2018. Assuming positive results, Incyte plans to submit a sNDA seeking accelerated approval of Jakafi in this indication in 2018. A phase III trial, GRAVITAS-301, on itacitinib, in patients with treatment-naïve acute GVHD, was initiated in July.The phase III trial, ECHO-301, evaluating epacadostat plus Keytruda in patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma is now fully-recruited and data are expected in the first half of 2018.The European Commission approved Olumiant in February 2017 for the treatment of moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis in adult patients who have responded inadequately to, or are intolerant to one or more disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs. The drug was approved in Japan too. However, the company suffered a setback when the FDA issued a complete response letter for Olumiant seeking additional clinical data to determine appropriate dosage.The FDA further stated that additional data are necessary to further characterize safety concerns across treatment arms. In August 2017, partner Eli Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) announced that the NDA will be submitted before January 2018, earlier than anticipated.Concurrent with the third-quarter results, Incyte announced expansion of its collaboration agreement with AstraZeneca PLC’s (AZN  -  Free Report) global biologics research and development arm, MedImmune. Both companies will evaluate the efficacy and safety of epacadostat in combination with AstraZeneca’s Imfinzi (durvalumab), a human monoclonal antibody directed against PD-L1, compared to Imfinzi alone.The two companies will conduct a phase III trial in patients with locally-advanced (Stage III), unresectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose disease has not progressed following platinum-based chemotherapy concurrent with radiation therapy (CRT). The trial is expected to begin in the first half of 2018 and costs will be shared.Our TakeIncyte beat both on earnings and sales in the third quarter on strong Jakafi performance. Jakafi sales were driven by patient demand. The increase in sales guidance was also encouraging. Inclusig also performed well and exceeded expectations.Going forward, the label expansion of Jakafi for GVHD will further boost sales. Meanwhile, partner Lilly plans to resubmit NDA for Olumiant earlier than expected. A potential approval will further boost the top-line.Zacks RankIncyte currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1143,LLY,"AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) reported mixed results in the third quarter of 2017. The company surpassed earnings estimates, while posted in-line revenues during the period. Importantly, the company raised its long-term sales expectations of its blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira, despite rising competition in the market. In response, shares nudged up almost 2% in pre-market trading.In the year so far, AbbVie’s shares have surged 48.6%, significantly outperforming the industry’s 16.1% rally.The biopharmaceutical company reported third-quarter 2017 earnings of $1.41 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.39 by 1.4%. The bottom line grew 16.5% year over year.The company posted revenues of $7 billion in the reported quarter, having met the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Revenues also increased 9.5% year over year. Excluding a 0.7% favorable impact from foreign exchange rate fluctuations, operational revenues climbed 8.8%.Quarter in DetailKey drug Humira recorded sales growth of 14.8%, on an operational basis, with revenues coming in at $4.7 billion. Sales in the United States rallied 19.1% to $3.2 billion. Humira sales in the ex-U.S. market were up 6.8% on operational basis and 9.7% on reported basis to $1.55 billion. Growth across all three major market categories drove the upside, despite increasing competition from new classes of drugs as well as an indirect biosimilar competition in international markets.Third-quarter net revenue from Imbruvica stood at $688 million, up 37.3% year over year. U.S. sales of Imbruvica were $574 million, up 31% compared with the year-ago figure. AbbVie recorded $114 million of international profit sharing with Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report).Other products that delivered an impressive performance include Duodopa, showing revenue growth of 22% on operational and 26.3% on reported basis. Another product called Creon witnessed an increase of 14.8% in revenues on both operational and reported basis.HCV (chronic hepatitis C virus) product recorded sales of $276 million, down 27.7% and 26.8% on operational and reported basis, respectively. The downside can be attributable to intense pricing and competitive pressure in the HCV market.Adjusted SG&A expenses were up 5.8% to $1.45 billion, while R&D expenses escalated 13.3% to $1.19 billion in the quarter. Adjusted operating margin was 43.1% of sales in the reported quarter.AbbVie announced an 11% hike in quarterly dividend to 71 cents per share from 64 cents per share. The increased payment will begin with the dividend payable in February next year.2017 OutlookAbbVie raised its adjusted earnings for 2017 in the range of $5.53-$5.55 compared with $5.44-$5.54, expected previously. The earnings guidance reflects year-over-year growth of 14.9% at the mid-point. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $5.53 per share.Long-Term GuidanceAbbVie projects adjusted EPS in the range of $6.37-$6.57 for 2018, showing an approximate 15-19% rally from the mid-point of the revised range of 2017 outlook.AbbVie estimates Humira to generate global sales of $21 billion in 2020, higher than $18 billion, predicted previously in 2015.Several companies are working on biosimilar versions of Humira. Though Amgen’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) Humira biosimilar received an FDA approval in September 2016, its launch is delayed to 2023 due to settlement of its patent dispute with AbbVie. This will make Humira free from competition for a few more years. Also, AbbVie has a robust intellectual property, which is expected to generate positive sentiments among the investors.Zacks Rank & Key PicksAbbVie currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1144,LLY,"Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter 2017 earnings of $1.01 per share, which easily beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 87 cents by 16.1%. Earnings also rose 8.6% from the year-ago period.Revenues for the quarter increased 1% year over year to $9.93 billion, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.79 billion. Currency movement negatively impacted revenues by 1%. Excluding currency impact, sales rose 2% year over year.Quarter in DetailThe Pharmaceutical segment posted revenues of $8.76 billion, up 1% (up 2% excluding Fx impact) year over year mainly backed by strong sales of PD-1 inhibitor, Keytruda.Keytruda brought in sales of $881 million in second-quarter 2017, up 51% sequentially and 180% year over year. Sales continued to be driven by launch of new indications globally.Keytruda sales in the U.S. gained particularly from strong momentum in the new indication of first-line lung cancer (approved in Oct 2016).In the last 2-3 months, there were a series of regulatory approvals for the label expansion of Keytruda that should drive sales going forward. Important approvals include that for advanced bladder cancer, advanced microsatellite instability-high cancers and first approval as a combination therapy with Eli Lilly & Company’s (LLY  -  Free Report) cancer drug Alimta (pemetrexed) and carboplatin (pem/carbo), in lung cancer.However, earlier this month, a pivotal phase III study of Keytruda in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma failed to meet the primary endpoint of overall survival. Also, three combination studies of Keytruda for multiple myeloma were placed on clinical hold, this month, following reports of death in the Keytruda groups.Meanwhile, competition in the immuno-oncology market is rising following recent FDA approval of Pfizer, Inc.’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Bavencio (avelumab) in Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) and bladder cancer and AstraZeneca plc’s (AZN  -  Free Report) Imfinzi (durvalumab) in bladder cancer.Zepatier brought in sales of $517 million, up from $378 million in the previous quarter, attributable to ongoing launches globally.Bridion (sugammadex) Injection generated sales of $163 million in the quarter, up 44% year over year, driven by the strong uptake from launch in the U.S.Meanwhile, combined sales of Remicade (lost exclusivity in Europe and facing stiff biosimilar competition in the region), Cubicin (lost patent protection in the U.S. in Jun 2016), Zetia (lost market exclusivity in the U.S. in Dec 2016) and Vytorin (lost U.S. exclusivity in Apr 2017) declined $830 million in the quarter. Sales of Isentress and the Januvia/Janumet (diabetes) franchise also declined in the quarter.Remicade sales declined 39% to $208 million in the quarter. Merck markets the branded version of Remicade outside the U.S. while Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) markets the rheumatoid arthritis drug in the U.S. This week, Merck launched Renflexis, a biosimilar version of Remicade, in the U.S.Cubicin sales plunged 71% to $103 million in the quarter. The Zetia/Vytorin franchise recorded sales of $549 million, down 45% due to loss of exclusivity for both Zetia and Vytorin.The Januvia/Janumet franchise recorded sales of $1.51 billion in the quarter, down 8% from the year-ago quarter due to lower sales in the U.S. due to pricing pressure and lower customer inventory levels.Isentress sales declined 17% in the quarter to $282 million. Lower volumes/demand due to competitive pressure is hurting sales of Isentress.Vaccine sales were primarily driven by increases in Gardasil and Pneumovax vaccines. Vaccine sales were also boosted by the addition of approximately $70 million ($40 million from Gardasil) of sales from the terminated vaccine joint venture with Sanofi. Gardasil/Gardasil 9 sales climbed 19% to $469 million driven by strong demand in Asia Pacific and the favorable timing of sales in Brazil.Merck’s Animal Health segment posted revenues of $955 million, up 6% (up 7% excluding Fx impact) from the year-ago quarter, primarily driven by higher sales of companion animal products.Margin DiscussionAdjusted gross margin came in at 77.6%, up 190 basis points (bps) quarter attributable to favorable effects of product mix and lower inventory write-offsMarketing and administrative (M&A) expenses increased 3% to $2.4 billion in the reported quarter. Research and development (R&D) spend increased 8% to $1.7 billion in the quarter.2017 GuidanceDespite lowering its expectations for negative impact of currency exchange rates, the company maintained its previously adjusted earnings guidance while raising its sales guidance marginally. The company expects adjusted earnings in the range of $3.76–$3.88 including approximately 1.0% negative foreign exchange impact (versus 1.5% previously).Revenues are expected in the range of $39.4 billion – $40.4 billion compared with the earlier forecast of $39.1–$40.3 billion, including negative currency impact of approximately 1% (versus 1.5% previously).Operating expenses are expected to increase year over year at a mid-single-digit rate compared with a low single-digit rate expected previously.Our TakeMerck’s second-quarter earnings were encouraging as the company beat both on sales and earnings. Strong performance of new products like Keytruda, Bridion and Zepatier and higher sales of vaccines and animal health franchises offset lower sales of diabetes franchise and loss of market exclusivity for many drugs.Merck’s shares have risen 8.2% this year so far, comparing unfavorably with 9.9% increase for the industry.Merck also announced a cancer collaboration with AstraZeneca to jointly commercialize and develop the latter’s PARP Inhibitor, Lynparza, both as monotherapy and in combination studies, for multiple cancer types. Lynparzais presently marketed for advanced ovarian cancer. Meanwhile, Merck will independently develop combination medicines with Lynpraza and Keytruda. For the deal, Merck will pay up to $8.5 billion in total consideration, including $1.6 billion in upfront payments.Merck also said that a network cyber-attack in June disrupted its global operations which could result in a temporary delay in fulfilling orders of some products.Merck & Company, Inc.

1145,LLY,"Industrial goods manufacturer, IDEX Corporation (IEX  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results after the closing bell on Oct 16. In the last reported quarter, adjusted earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 cents. IDEX’s earnings track record has been quite healthy, having beaten estimates in three of the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 4%.Let's see how things are shaping up for the upcoming quarterly results.Key Factors to ConsiderWith operations across five continents, IDEX’s performance is exposed to the adverse impact of macroeconomic cycles in the United States and international markets. Rising dollar strength and unfavorable foreign currency movements are further likely to add to the woes and impact its bottom line.In addition, the company operates in a highly competitive industry. Maintaining and improving its competitive position entails continued investment in manufacturing, engineering, quality standards, and support and distribution networks. This involves huge recurring R&D expenses that increase its operating costs. This also reduces IDEX’s price control over its products, which often leads to loss of market share, decline in top-line growth and lower operating margin. The impending quarterly results are likely to witness these trends as well, affecting its bottom line.For the to-be-reported-quarter, IDEX’s revenues are likely to be affected by the volatility in the market as it procures substantial amount of raw materials and components from suppliers across the globe. This makes it susceptible to various operating risks, including the availability and prices for raw materials, curtailment or change in parts and components, interruptions in production by suppliers and prevailing price levels.However, IDEX is striving to counter the muted growth environment by improving productivity and conducting heavy restructuring initiatives across its portfolio. At the same time, it aims to exploit suitable acquisition opportunities to fuel its inorganic growth momentum. These acquisitions expand its geographic reach, fill technology gaps and strengthen its foothold in the existing markets along with expanding its product lines.The company also aims to increase its market exposure and improve sales mix by continually developing new products. With a flexible yet disciplined focus on expenses and productivity, it intends to optimize the cost structure, increase competitiveness and reallocate resources to improve profitability.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that IDEX is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is pegged at -0.13%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.IDEX Corporation Price and EPS Surprise IDEX Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | IDEX Corporation QuoteZacks Rank: IDEX has a Zacks Rank #2. While this increases the predictive power of ESP, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.37% and a Zacks Rank #1.

1146,LLY,"It was a historic week not just for Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) but also for the medical community and patients with the FDA giving its nod to the first gene therapy in the United States – Novartis’ Kymriah. This marks the beginning of a new era for the treatment of cancer and other serious and life-threatening diseases.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesNovartis Gets Head Start in CAR-T Market with Kymriah Approval: Novartis got a huge boost with the FDA approving the company’s CAR-T cell therapy, Kymriah for children and young adults with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (“ALL”) that is refractory or has relapsed at least twice. This makes Kymriah the first CAR-T cell treatment to be approved in the United States. The path-breaking immunocellular therapy is a one-time treatment that uses a patient's own T cells to fight cancer. ALL, a cancer of the bone marrow and blood, progresses quickly and is the most common childhood cancer in the United States. According to the National Cancer Institute, about 3,100 patients (20 years and younger) are diagnosed with ALL every year. Kymriah not only provides these patients with a new treatment option, it has also shown promising remission and survival rates in studies.Novartis intends to seek label expansion for Kymriah later this year for additional indications including the treatment of adult patients with r/r diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (Also read: Novartis CAR-T Therapy Kymriah Receives FDA Approval). Shares of Novartis have gained 14.8% year to date, outperforming the industry’s 11.1% rally. Novartis is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.

Austedo, which had gained FDA approval in Apr 2017 for the treatment of chorea associated with Huntington’s disease, is now approved for the treatment of tardive dyskinesia in adults as well. Tardive dyskinesia, a debilitating and often irreversible movement disorder, is estimated to affect about 500,000 people in the United States (Also read: Teva Austedo Gets FDA Nod for Label Expansion in Dyskinesia).Teva is currently going through tough times with the company’s performance being impacted by generic pricing erosion. Teva has many challenges ahead – paying down debt, divesting non-core businesses to increase focus on core areas and generate cash, hiring a permanent CEO, delivering on the pipeline and getting the U.S. generics business back on track.Lilly Provides Baricitinib Regulatory Update: Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) and partner Incyte provided an update regarding the resubmission of their regulatory application in the United States for their experimental rheumatoid arthritis (“RA”) treatment, baricitinib. The companies, which had previously said that they expect a delay of at least 18 months in the resubmission of the regulatory application for baricitinib, announced that they will be resubmitting the regulatory application by Jan 2018.

1147,LLY,"Eli Lilly & Company (LLY  -  Free Report) and partner Incyte Corporation (INCY  -  Free Report) announced that they will re-submit the new drug application (NDA) for its rheumatoid arthritis (RA) drug, baricitinib much faster than previously expected. The NDA is expected to be re-submitted in January next year.In July, Lilly had said that the NDA resubmission for baricitinib will not occur this year and will be delayed by a minimum of 18 months. At that time, Lilly had said that it will evaluate options for resubmission, including further discussions with the FDA or conducting an additional clinical study.In the latest press release, Lilly/Incyte said that the matter was discussed with the FDA this month. Lilly expects the revised submission, which will include new safety and efficacy data, to be classified by the FDA as a Class II resubmission. A decision from the FDA is therefore expected in six months. Importantly, a new clinical study will not be required.Shares of Incyte were up more than 10% on Wednesday while that of Lilly were up around 2.5%. So far this year, Lilly’s share price has risen 6.8% compared with an increase of 11.3% for the industry.The FDA had issued a complete response letter (CRL) for baricitinib earlier this year in April. At that time, the agency had told the companies that it is unable to approve baricitinib NDA in its current form. The FDA had asked for additional clinical data to determine the most appropriate doses as well as to further characterize safety concerns across treatment arms.Baricitinib, a once-daily oral medication, is already marketed in the EU by the trade name of Olumiant. The drug generated sales of $4.8 million in the second quarter of 2017 and $1.9 million in the first quarter.Baricitinib is also being studied in phase II studies for the treatment of atopic dermatitis and systemic lupus erythematosus while the phase III program for psoriatic arthritis is expected to begin next year.The RA market is highly crowded given the presence of treatments like Humira and Xeljanz among others.

1148,LLY,"Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) announced detailed data from a large phase III cardiovascular outcomes study (REVEAL) evaluating anacetrapib, a cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitor in patients with cardiovascular disease.Data from the phase III study showed that anacetrapib and a statin reduced the risk of major coronary events (composite of coronary death, myocardial infarction, and coronary revascularization) by 9% relative to placebo in patients with atherosclerotic vascular disease who are already receiving an effective cholesterol treatment. While anacetrapib reduced the risk to 10.8%, the same was 11.8% for patients on a placebo and a statin. However, no significant benefit was observed in reducing the risk of ischemic stroke.The detailed data were published in the New England Journal of Medicine and presented at the European Society of Cardiology Congress.Merck’s shares have risen 7.2% this year so far, comparing unfavorably with an 11.2% increase for the industry.Top-line data from the study was announced in June 2017 wherein the company said that the study had met the primary endpoint. It also said that the CETP inhibitorled to significant reduction in major coronary eventsversus placebo in patients at high risk of cardiovascular events who are already receiving an effective cholesterol treatment. However, the details have only been mentioned now.The company-funded REVEAL study was conducted in more than 30,000 patients who were taking atorvastatin – a common medicine for lowering ""bad"" cholesterol or LDL - for a median duration of at least four years.It was also said that anacetrapib’s safety profile was in line with that observed in previous studies with the most significant side effect being the accumulation of anacetrapib in adipose or fat tissue for years after taking the drug.As announced in June, Merck is not sure whether the data are strong enough to seek approval and plans to review the results with external experts. The company will then consider whether to file regulatory applications with the FDA and other agencies.We remind investors that three previous experimental CETP inhibitors had failed in their respective studies. CETP inhibitors are designed to raise HDL-cholesterol levels or what is known as “good” cholesterol.In 2015, Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) terminated the development of its late-stage CETP inhibitor, evacetrapib based on the recommendation of an independent data monitoring committee, which suggested that chances of meeting the primary endpoint were low. Back in 2006, Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) had suspended the late-stage development of its CETP inhibitor, torceptrapib, due to safety issues. In 2012, Roche (RHHBY  -  Free Report) discontinued the development of its CETP inhibitor, dalcetrapib, due to lack of efficacy.However, uncertainty regarding whether or not the company will actually file the data with regulators remains. It is apprehended that the accumulation of anacetrapib in fat tissues could get in the way of regulatory approval.Merck carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

(MRK  -  Free Report) announced that it is not going ahead with filing the regulatory applications seeking approval for anacetrapib, a cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitor that it had developed for cholesterol management.The stock was down more than 1% on Wednesday.

Merck said it will consider whether to file regulatory applications with the FDA and other agencies after reviewing the results with external experts. It was apprehended by investors that the accumulation of anacetrapib in fat tissues could get in the way of regulatory approval.Following a thorough evaluation of data and discussions with external experts, Merck decided not to seek approval for anacetrapib as its clinical profile did not support regulatory filings.We remind investors that three previous experimental CETP inhibitors had failed in their respective studies.

1150,LLY,"The series of setbacks continues for Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) as the company announced that its phase III JUNIPER study failed to meet the primary endpoint. The study was evaluating Verzenio in advanced non-small lung cancer (""NSCLC"") with KRAS mutation. Shares fell 1% on Tuesday after the announcement.Verzenio received approval for treating metastatic breast cancer last month in patients where the disease progressed after platinum-based chemotherapy.Lilly’s shares are up 17.1% so far this year, slightly underperforming the industry’s gain of 18.3% in the period.The JUNIPER study compared Verzenio with Roche/Astella Pharma’s Tarceva in stage IV lung cancer patients who have progressed after platinum-based chemotherapy and may have received an additional systemic therapy. The study did not meet its primary endpoint of overall survival. However, it showed some improvement in secondary endpoints of progression-free survival in patients and overall response rate.A successful completion of the study would have given Verzenio an edge over Pfizer Inc's (PFE  -  Free Report) Ibrance and Novartis AG's (NVS  -  Free Report) Kisqali, which are only approved for breast cancer.Lilly is currently evaluating Verzenio in multiple studies in NSCLC, including a combination therapy with Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda, an anti-PD-1 therapy.We remind investors that Lilly faced two major setbacks in the past one year. These included a complete response letter from the FDA for its rheumatoid arthritis candidate, baricitinib, in April 2017 and a failed study on Alzheimer's candidate solanezumab in November last year.Meanwhile, Lilly is also facing generic competition due to loss of exclusivity for several key drugs including Zyprexa and Cymbalta. Moreover, Alimta is facing competition from immuno-oncology agents in the United States.Given the recent setbacks, generic competition and absence of drugs nearing approval, Lilly may struggle to maintain the growth pace that it has shown so far this year.Eli Lilly and Company Price and Consensus  Eli Lilly and Company Price and Consensus | Eli Lilly and Company QuoteLilly carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1151,LLY,"Seattle Genetics, Inc. (SGEN  -  Free Report) and Astellas Pharma Inc announced the initiation of a phase II study-EV-201 of enfortumab vedotin. The study will evaluate patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who have been previously treated with checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) therapy.Enfortumab vedotin is an investigational antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) to target Nectin-4, a cell adhesion molecule which is expressed on many solid tumors.Seattle Genetics’ shares have underperformed the industry year to date. The stock has surged 9.4% compared with the industry’s gain of 14.3%.The study will evaluate the antitumor activity and safety of enfortumab vedotin in order to get the approval of the FDA. The study will enroll about 120 patients and enfortumab vedotin will be administered three of every four weeks for the duration of treatment. The primary endpoint of the study is confirmed objective response rate (ORR), per independent review. The secondary endpoints include assessments of overall survival, progression free-survival, safety and tolerability.The company will move ahead with the EV-201 study based on the results of its ongoing phase I study. The ongoing phase I study is assessing the safety and anti-tumor activity of enfortumab vedotin at escalating doses of 0.5 to 1.25 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg), weekly for three of every four week cycles. The company in June 2017 announced updated data from 81 patients who were diagnosed with mUC and with a median age of 67 years. Of these patients, 46% were previously treated with checkpoint inhibitor (CPIs) and 95% had undergone treatment with a platinum-based chemotherapy. The results showed positive antitumor activity and a well-tolerated safety profile in patients with heavily pretreated metastatic urothelial cancer.The treatment options for metastatic urothelial cancers are limited for those patients who do not respond to chemotherapy and checkpoint inhibitors. There are no therapies approved by the FDA for patients who progress following CPI treatment.  Thus, we see that there are a number of companies evaluating candidates for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer.Last month, Merck & Co., Inc (MRK  -  Free Report) announced that its anti-PD-1 therapy, Keytruda received approval from the European Commission (EC) for the first- and second-line treatment of certain patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma, a type of bladder cancer.Keytruda has been approved as a first-line therapy for patients who cannot receive standard of care chemotherapy containing cisplatin. Keytruda was also approved as a second-line treatment for patients who have been previously treated with platinum-containing chemotherapy.In May 2017, Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) also announced positive results from a phase III study, RANGE, evaluating its oncology drug, Cyramza (ramucirumab), for expanded use in combination with docetaxel in patients with locally advanced or unresectable or metastatic urothelial carcinoma. The study met its primary end-points and demonstrated an improved progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with the given indication. Seattle Genetics, Inc. Price  Seattle Genetics, Inc.

1152,LLY,"The second-quarter reporting cycle is in full swing. The quarter, undoubtedly, is off to a strong start.As of Jul 26, 2017, 171 S&P 500 members, accounting for 44.1% of the index’s total market capitalization, reported results, according to Earnings Preview.Total earnings for these 171 index members were up 8.8% from the year-ago quarter on a 3.4% improvement in revenues.

(BIIB  -  Free Report) released their second-quarter results this week. Both the companies beat earnings and revenue estimates and raised their sales and earnings expectations for the full year.

1153,LLY,"Yesterday, big pharma player, Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) reported better-than-expected second quarter results and raised its outlook for the year. However, shares were down 3% with investors focusing on the company’s update regarding its investigational rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment, baricitinib.Here is a look at a few key takeaways from Lilly’s conference call.How Did Key Drugs Perform?Lilly’s second quarter 2017 revenues increased 8% from the year-ago quarter to $5.8 billion, topping the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.6 billion. New products like Trulicity, Taltz, Basaglar, Jardiance, Lartruvo and Cyramza performed well and drove volume growth. Late life cycle products like Cialis and Forteo drove price growth.Alimta continued to face significant competitive headwinds while Zyprexa, Cymbalta, Evista, Strattera and Axiron were impacted by loss of exclusivity. Cialis was also affected by lower volume in the U.S. reflecting a decline in the overall erectile disorder (ED) market as well as the presence of generics.Animal health revenue declined during the quarter reflecting market access pressure and competitive pressure in cattle and swine (Read more: Lilly Q2 Earnings Top, Baricitinib Re-Filing Delayed).Baricitinib Facing Significant DelayLilly announced that there will be a delay of at least 18 months in the resubmission of the regulatory application for baricitinib, which is being developed in collaboration with Incyte (INCY  -  Free Report). This means the resubmission will not take place this year.The FDA had issued a complete response letter (CRL) for baricitinib earlier this year in April. At that time, the agency had told the companies that it is unable to approve baricitinib, a once-daily oral medication for the treatment of moderate-to-severe RA, in its current form. The FDA had asked for additional clinical data to determine the most appropriate doses as well as to further characterize safety concerns across treatment arms.Although Lilly disagrees with the FDA's conclusions and believes the comprehensive clinical data supports a positive benefit-risk profile, the company will enter into discussions with the FDA to determine the kind of study needed to better define the benefit-risk profile of baricitinib.Meanwhile, Lilly and Incyte have plans to explore baricitinib for other indications with a late-stage study in psoriatic arthritis slated to commence next year while studies in atopic dermatitis and lupus continue. Phase II atopic dermatitis data will be presented at a scientific forum by year end.We note that baricitinib was approved in the EU under the trade name Olumiant in Feb 2017. The European Medicines Agency's (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) recently agreed that the label should be updated to include a precaution for patients who have risk factors for deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). Oncology R&D StrategyLilly provided an in-depth look at its oncology R&D strategy. The company’s strategy involves building on key treatments like Cyramza, Lartruvo and abemaciclib as foundational agents while it will focus on developing new standard-of-care changing therapies that clear a very high bar and will span a variety of mechanisms including immune-oncology. For now, Lilly will focus on seven candidates for priority internal development and three additional candidates (Ang2 MAb, CSF1R MAb and merestinib) with study data pending. The rest of the molecules in the pipeline will be partnered.The seven molecules that have made it to Lilly’s priority development list include abemaciclib which is already under FDA review, TIM-3 MAb, PD-L1 MAb, Erk 1/2 inhibitor, TGFb RI KI, PI3/mTOR inhibitor and prexasertib. About 10 molecules are earmarked for external or partnered development -- while three of these assets are owned by third parties, Lilly is looking for partners for the remaining seven -- a FGFR-3 ADC, ralimetinib, a FGFR inhibitor, a notch inhibitor, galunisertib, a CXCR4 peptide antagonist and emibetuzumab.Bottom LineAlthough Lilly delivered a “beat and raise” quarter, the company’s results got overshadowed by the baricitinib update. Investors were disappointed by the delay in the resubmission of the baricitinib regulatory filing in the U.S. with the company saying that there could be a minimum delay of 18 months. With several products facing generic competition and competitive pressure increasing, Lilly needs to focus on bringing new products to market. The company’s decision to prioritize its oncology pipeline makes sense. Lilly is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock -- you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. Year-to-date, Lilly’s shares have gained 11.8%, just about topping the industry’s 11.2% rally.Watch out for earnings reports from other large cap pharma companies like Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) and Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report). Merck, a Zacks Rank #2 stock has a pretty good earnings track record having surpassed expectations in each of the last four quarters with an average surprise of 4.36%. Merck will be reporting Q2 results on Jul 28.Pfizer’s track record is mixed with the company topping expectations in two of the last four quarters.

Biogen’s AD pipeline comprises candidates with different mechanisms of action including anti-tau candidate (BIIB092/BMS-986168 - with potential in AD as well as progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP)), anti-amyloid (aducanumab) candidates as well as a BACE inhibitor (elenbecestat) program.However, the successful development of therapies for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease is challenging and we note that several companies have failed in developing treatments for the same. In November last year, Eli Lilly & Company's (LLY  -  Free Report) anti-amyloid candidate solanezumab failed to meet the primary endpoint in a late-stage AD study. Lilly decided to drop the development of solanezumab. Lilly suffered a major setback in Aug 2010, when it had to halt the development of another phase III Alzheimer’s candidate semagacestat.Meanwhile, Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) shelved its late-stage Alzheimer’s candidate, bapineuzumab IV, after it failed two phase III studies. Pfizer was developing the candidate in collaboration with Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) and Elan Corporation.The Alzheimer’s disease market represents a huge commercial potential and a successfully developed product could generate billions of dollars in sales once launched.Biogen has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1157,LLY,"Pharma and biotech stocks started 2017 on a strong note with this part of the market remaining in favor as the year progresses. So far this year, the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index and the NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index are up 25.6% and 14.6%, respectively.With investors being more comfortable with the drug pricing scenario, focus has shifted to the fundamentals of the sector. Although the drug pricing issue will remain a headwind, expectations are that steps taken by the Trump administration to drive down drug prices will not be as draconian as previously expected.  Deregulation and increased competition seem to be some of the ways that will be used to control drug prices. The FDA is working to lower healthcare costs by speeding up the development of next-generation treatments, especially for rare diseases or targeted cancer therapies and is also working on clearing up a backlog of orphan drug applications.The FDA has approved far more drugs this year than it did in the whole of 2016. Key approvals this year include Novartis’s (NVS  -  Free Report) Kymriah (the first gene therapy in the United States), Lilly’s Verzenio (advanced or metastatic breast cancer), Gilead’s (GILD  -  Free Report) Vosevi (hepatitis C virus), Puma’s Nerlynx (to reduce the risk of breast cancer returning), J&J’s Tremfya (moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis), Regeneron/Sanofi’s Kevzara (rheumatoid arthritis), Roche’s multiple sclerosis treatment, Ocrevus, Regeneron and Sanofi’s eczema treatment, Dupixent, Tesaro’s PARP inhibitor, Zejula, and BioMarin’s Brineura (treatment of a specific form of Batten disease) among others. Quite a few of these drugs have blockbuster potential.Meanwhile, some other factors that should continue having a positive impact on pharma and biotech stocks are new product sales ramp up, R&D success and innovation, strong results, a higher number of FDA approvals and continued strong performance from legacy products.According to the Zacks Earnings Trends report, the medical sector, which has been among the better performing sectors over the last several quarters, is expected to record earnings growth of 1% on revenue growth of 4.7% in the third quarter.Given this scenario and with medical sector earnings round the corner, it would make sense to look at some pharma and biotech stocks that are expected to report a positive earnings surprise in the quarter.Investing in such stocks could prove beneficial for investors as an earnings beat usually leads to significant share price appreciation.5 Drug Stocks to Keep an Eye on This Earnings SeasonWith the help of the Zacks Stock Screener, we have zeroed-in on five pharma and biotech stocks that sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) and have a positive Earnings ESP.

(PFE  -  Free Report): Pfizer is focused on the development and commercialization of a wide range of medicines and vaccines as well consumer health care products. The company has surpassed earnings expectations in each of the first two quarters of 2017. Key revenue drivers include Ibrance, Eliquis and Xeljanz. Pfizer, which expects 2017 revenues to be affected by about $2.5 billion due to loss of exclusivities (LOEs), is working on bringing new products to market to make up for lost sales. The company has 15 potential blockbusters lined up for the next 5 years with about half of these potentially by 2020. Focus also remains on growing new products like Ibrance, Eliquis and Xeljanz. Meanwhile, the impact of LOEs should continue declining in the coming years (about $2 billion in 2018 as well as 2019, $1 billion - $2 billion in 2020; $1 billion in 2021, and $0.5 billion or less from 2022 to 2025).Pfizer, a Zacks Rank #2 stock, carries a VGM Score of B.

This Zacks Rank #3 stock has an earnings ESP of +4.46% for the third quarter. Lilly surpassed earnings expectations in the first two quarters of 2017.

Estimated earnings growth for the current year is 17.9%.Lilly has gained 18.4% year to date, compared to the 18% rally of the industry it belongs to.Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX  -  Free Report): Vertex, a key player in the cystic fibrosis (CF) market, surpassed earnings expectations in three of the last four quarters with an average surprise of 17.9%. The company holds a strong position in the CF market with two products, Orkambi and Kalydeco, in its portfolio. Early in August, Vertex had said that it expects its CF franchise to deliver revenues of $1.87 billion - $2.1 billion in 2017 including Orkambi revenues of $1.1 billion - $1.3 billion.The company is working on expanding its CF portfolio and is currently seeking both FDA and EMA approval for a tezacaftor/ivacaftor combination. With the FDA granting priority review, a response should be out by Feb 28, 2018.Vertex, a Zacks Rank #1 stock, has gained 111.1% year to date, substantially outperforming the 13.9% rally of the industry it belongs to. The company, which is expected to report third quarter results on October 24, has an Earnings ESP of +2.56% for the quarter.Biogen Inc. (BIIB  -  Free Report): Biogen is a key name in the multiple sclerosis (“MS”) market with several approved products like Tecfidera, Tysabri and Avonex in its portfolio. The company also has a spinal muscular atrophy product (Spinraza) in its portfolio and is working on developing treatments for diseases like Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.Biogen’s earnings track record is good with the company surpassing earnings expectations in each of the last four quarters with an average surprise of 6.4%. The company, which is scheduled to report third quarter results on October 24, has an Earnings ESP of +0.32%.

The company will be reporting Q3 earnings on October 27 - earnings ESP for Q3 is +0.28%. Although the company does have challenges in the form of generic competition as well as safety issues related to some studies being conducted with Keytruda, new products like Keytruda and the strong performance of the base business should provide support. Merck also has a deep pipeline which bodes well for long-term growth.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

1159,LLY,"Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share of $1.11, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.04 by 6.7%. Earnings rose 29% from the year-ago quarter backed by volume driven pharma sales growth and higher profits.Revenues BeatQuarterly revenues of $5.82 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.59 billion by 4.2%. Sales grew 8% year over year backed by higher volumes and realized prices. However, foreign exchange pulled down sales by 1%.Volumes rose 5% as higher volumes of new products like Trulicity, Taltz, Basaglar, Jardiance and Lartruvo offset lower volumes of established products like Zyprexa, Alimta, Cialis and Strattera.Pharmaceutical volumes rose 8% in the quarter. However, worldwide competitive pressure hurt sales in Lilly’s Animal Health segment.Revenue in DetailU.S. revenues grew 15% to $3.32 billion, reflecting higher volume of products like Trulicity, Taltz, Basaglar, Jardiance and Lartruvo, which offset lower volumes of established drugs.Ex-U.S. revenues declined 1% to $2.5 billion mainly due to lower volumes, increased competition and lower realized prices. Higher volumes of newer products like Cyramza and Trulicity were offset by lower volumes of Zyprexa, Cymbalta and Alimta due to the loss of exclusivity. Cymbalta has lost exclusivity in Europe and Canada, Zyprexa in Japan and Alimta in several countries. Lower sales of food and companion animal products hurt outside U.S. sales as well.Established products that recorded growth during the quarter include Forteo (up 22% to $446.7 million), Humulin (up 8% to $357.8 million) and Effient (up 6% to $142.9 million).Alimta sales, however, declined 12% to $532.9 million, reflecting lower demand in the U.S. due to competitive pressure, mainly from immuno-oncology agents. Outside the U.S., sales of Alimta were hurt by loss of exclusivity in several countries, increased competition and lower realized prices.Zyprexa sales declined 33% to $140.8 million due to loss of exclusivity.Humalog sales decreased 3% in the quarter to $678.4 million due to lower realized prices and volumes in the U.S.Cialis sales were flat at $627.3 million hurt by lower demand in the U.S. as well as increased competition from generic sildenafilErbitux sales declined 12% to $159.1 million in the quarter. Strattera sales declined 17% to $186.6 million. Cymbalta sales declined 13% to $206.6 million.Among new products, Trulicity generated revenues of $480.2 million, up 139% year over year, with U.S. revenues benefiting from growth in the GLP-1 market and market share gains.Cyramza revenues were $186.3 million, up 27% year over year, backed mainly by higher outside U.S. revenues. Cyramza’s ex-U.S. revenues benefited from strong volumes in Japan. However, U.S. revenues increased only 1% as higher realized prices made up for lower demand due to competitive pressure.Jardiance sales (up 157% to $103.2 million) were driven by increased market share within the growing SGLT2 class.Basaglar recorded revenues of $86.6 million compared with $46.0 million in the previous quarter. Basaglar - Lilly and partner Boehringer Ingelheim’s follow-on insulin to Sanofi’s (SNY  -  Free Report) blockbuster drug, Lantus - was launched in the U.S. in mid-Dec 2016 where it generated revenues of $59.5 million in the quarter.Taltz brought in sales of $138.7 million compared with $96.6 million in the previous quarter, reflecting strong launch uptake.Lartruvo (olaratumab) generated revenues of $47.4 million in the second quarter of 2017 compared with $42.1 million in the previous quarter. Lartruvo was launched in the U.S. and the EU for soft tissue sarcoma in the fourth quarter of 2016. U.S. revenues were $39.7 million compared with $36 million in the previous quarter.Meanwhile, Lilly and partner Incyte Corporation’s (INCY  -  Free Report) rheumatoid arthritis (RA) drug Olumiant (baricitinib) was approved in EU in Feb 2017. The drug generated sales of $4.8 million in the second quarter of 2017 compared with $1.9 million in the previous quarter. The drug received marketing approval in Japan earlier this month.However, in the U.S., the companies received a complete response letter (CRL) from the FDA in April regarding the new drug application (NDA) for baricitinib. Concurrent with the earnings release, Lilly announced that the NDA resubmission for baricitinib will not occur this year and will be delayed by a minimum of 18 months. The company said that the FDA has indicated that an additional clinical study will be needed for a resubmission.Lilly's Animal Health segment sales declined 9% to $784.8 million despite inclusion of revenues from the acquisition of Boehringer Ingelheim Vetmedica's U.S. feline, canine and rabies (acquired in Jan 2017). Animal Health revenues were hurt due to global competitive pressure that affected sales of both food animal and companion animal revenues in the quarter.Gross Margin & Operating Income RiseAdjusted gross margin of 76.7% in the quarter increased 70 basis points primarily driven by higher realized prices and manufacturing efficiencies.Operating income increased 31% to $1.51 billion on higher gross margins. Operating expenses remained flat in the quarter. However, total operating expenses, as a percent of revenues, declined 390 basis points in the quarter.2017 Outlook UppedLilly raised its previously issued 2017 adjusted earnings and sales outlook. Adjusted earnings per share are now expected in the range of $4.10 to $4.20 compared with $4.05 to $4.15 previously. Revenues are expected in the range of $22.0–$22.5 billion compared with $21.8–$22.3 billion expected previously. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings and revenues is $4.12 per share and $22.18 billion, respectively.Gross margin is expected to be approximately 76%, lower than 77% previously. Adjusted tax rate is still expected to be approximately 22%.Marketing, selling and administrative expenses are still expected in the range of $6.4–$6.6 billion, while research and development expenses are projected to be $5.0-$5.2 billion, slightly higher than $4.9–$5.1 billion expected previously.Our TakeLilly’s second-quarter 2017 results were strong with the company beating estimates on both counts. The pharma giant also raised its sales and earnings outlook for the year. However, the news of the delay in re-filing for baricitinib sent shares down almost 2% in pre-market trading. So far this year, Lilly’s share price has risen 15.2% compared with an increase of 11.8% for the industry.The company also said that it will build on its oncology portfolio and work on developing next-generation immunotherapies. It will prioritize development of seven pipeline candidates.Going forward, new products like Trulicity, Taltz, Basaglar, Cyramza, Jardiance and Lartruvo are expected to see higher revenues. Lilly also expects some established products like Trajenta, Forteo and Humalog to continue doing well. However, Alimta will continue to be impacted by competition. Other headwinds include competition from immuno-oncology agents as well as loss of exclusivity for many drugs in emerging markets. Meanwhile, the recent high-profile pipeline setbacks are an investor concern and so is the weak performance of the Animal Health segment in the first half.Lilly carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1161,LLY,"The third-quarter earnings season is off to a strong start.  The results of the companies that have reported numbers show that earnings and revenue growth pace is accelerating from the first two quarters. In particular, revenue growth has shown significant momentum as evident from the proportion of positive revenue surprises. Total earnings for the S&P 500 index for the third quarter are expected to be up 3% on 4.9% higher revenues.As of Oct 20, 2017, 87 S&P 500 companies which account for 24.7% of index’s total market capitalization have reported results. Results reveal that earnings for these companies are up 9.4% from the year-ago quarter on a 7.3% increase in revenues. Among these, 71.3% beat earnings estimates while 70.1% beat revenue estimates.Medical Sector PerformanceThe Medical sector has performed relatively well till date and this quarter is not going to be any different as per estimates. Of the 5.4% companies that have reported so far, 66.7% beat on revenues while all the companies surpassed earnings expectations. Going forward, the sector is expected to record year-over-year growth of 4.8% in revenues and 1.9% in earnings in Q3.The bellwether of the sector, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) reported better-than-expected third-quarter 2017 results and raised its outlook. Swiss giant Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) too beat on both earnings and sales on the back of new drugs like Cosentyx and Entresto. Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) also reported better-than-expected results in the third quarter.Here we have four major biotech giants that are set to report third-quarter results on Oct 26.

Last quarter, the company beat expectations by 17.4%. Overall, the company recorded an average positive earnings surprise of 6.4%. Gilead currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +0.57%. The combination of Zacks Rank #3 and a positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Strong HIV performance and other antiviral product sales are being driven by continued uptake of tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) based products — Genvoya, Descovy and Odefsey. We expect the trend to continue in the third quarter as well. Genvoya has already become the most prescribed regimen for both treatment-naïve and switch patients since its launch. This should drive the non-HCV product sales.  The TAF-based regimens now represent 51% of total Gilead HIV prescription volume following the launch of Genvoya and Odefsey and Descovy in 2016. Specifically, Genvoya is now the company’s bestselling HIV product with a treatment-naïve patient share of 41%. The Zacks Consensus estimate for Genvoya stands at $919 million.

The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 with an ESP of -0.81%. This makes surprise prediction difficult. Alexion’s blockbuster drug, Soliris, continues to perform well. Alexion continues to identify and treat a consistently high number of new patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) with Soliris, across its 50-country operating platform. Alexion is also working on expanding Soliris’ label into additional indications.

1162,LLY,"We’ve already got a busy day of Q3 earnings reports to sift through, and market participants should take heart that, by and large, most major companies reporting before the opening bell have outperformed expectations — in some cases by a wide margin. After today’s market close, we expect another wave of Q3 reports from companies such as AT&T (T  -  Free Report) and Chipotle (CMG  -  Free Report). But let’s dig in with the breakfast portion of earnings results:Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)-rated Caterpillar (CAT  -  Free Report) is up 7% in pre-market trading following its blowout results in Q3 earnings and revenues. Its bottom line of $1.77 per share amounts to a 45% positive earnings surprise over the $1.22 in the Zacks consensus, and miles ahead of the 85 cents per share in CAT’s fiscal Q3 2016. Sales reached $11.4 billion, far surpassing the $10.6 billion expected and $9.2 billion a year ago. Construction growth in China and on-shore oil & gas businesses in North America drove quarterly growth most notably.Remarkably, CAT’s 45% earnings surprise is roughly in-line with the heavy machinery manufacturer’s trailing four quarters of earnings beats, bolstered by a Q1 2017 surprise of more than 100%. Caterpillar has also upped full-year guidance to around $6.25 per share; $5.26 was the previous Zacks consensus estimate. CAT also carries a Zacks Style Score of A.General Motors (GM  -  Free Report) also outperformed expectations this morning: its $1.32 per share easily outperformed the $1.07 expected — though results are still down more than 20% year over year — on quarterly sales of $33.62 billion — well beyond the $31.6 billion we had been looking for. GM looks to bring two electric cars to market in the next year and a half. It also has posted a positive earnings surprise for at least the past five straight quarters, with a trailing 4-quarter average of 14.7%. Shares of GM are up 3% at this point in today’s pre-market.Defense and aerospace major United Technologies (UTX  -  Free Report) topped expectations on earnings, revenues and guidance. This is the third straight earnings beat for the parent company of Pratt & Whitney, Otis Elevators, and many other companies: $1.73 per share beat the Zacks consensus by 5 cents, whereas the top-line actual of $15.1 billion outperformed the $14.9 billion we had been looking for. Full-year guidance was also raised from $6.45 - 6.60 per share to $6.58 - 6.63.Industrial supply giant 3M (MMM  -  Free Report) also beat top and bottom-line estimates prior to Tuesday’s open, with earnings of $2.33 per share and revenues of $8.17 billion surprising the $2.21 per share and $7.91 billion expected. Full-year guidance was also ratcheted up notably, from the previous Zacks consensus estimate of $8.95 per share to $9.00 - 9.15 as of its Q3 report. Shares of 3M are up 1.6% thus far in today’s pre-market.McDonald’s (MCD  -  Free Report) posted a mixed Q3 earnings report this morning, beating earnings estimates by a penny to $1.76 per share on $5.76 billion, which was a bit shy of the $5.80 billion expected. The Zacks ESP called this one-cent beat exactly, even as the negative impact of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma hit same-store sales in Texas and Florida from Q3 2016. In fact, U.S. comps were up 4.1% in the quarter, and International was up 6%. Shares are currently up 1.3% in early trading.Other companies this morning to have surpassed expectations and also raised full-year guidance are Stanley Black & Decker (SWK  -  Free Report), Eli Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) and Polaris (PII  -  Free Report).

1164,LLY,"Anthera Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ANTH  -  Free Report) announced positive top-line data from the extension of a phase II BRIGHT-SC study, evaluating key pipeline candidate, blisibimod for treatment of patients with IgA nephropathy (IgAN).Notably, the BRIGHT-SC study is randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled, initiated in June 2013, to evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of blisibimod in patients with IgAN.Anthera’s share price movement shows that the stock has significantly underperformed the industry so far this year. The stock has plunged 73% versus the industry’s 9.4% increase during the period.The extension of phase II BRIGHT-SC study demonstrated a tendency toward lower proteinuria in blisibimod when compared to placebo-treated patients. The study also showed a trend toward preservation of renal function (eGFR) in patients treated with blisibimod. The candidate was well-tolerated during the study compared with placebo.The trial was conducted on total 58 patients. Patients enrolled in the study were treated for up to 2 years and had the opportunity to complete at least 60 weeks of treatment. Anthera is planning to share these results with the FDA and proceed with a phase III trial for patients with the same indication.We remind investors that the company has a mid-stage development candidate, Sollpura, acquired from Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) in July 2014. The candidate is being developed for treating patients with low digestive enzyme levels or exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) due to cystic fibrosis or other potential diseases.The company initiated a phase III SOLUTION study on Sollpura in the third quarter of 2015. In December 2016, the company announced that the study had narrowly missed the primary endpoint of a change in the Coefficient of Fat Absorption (CFA) non-inferiority margin. However, Sollpura achieved a statistical criterion for nitrogen absorption and later on, Anthera too reported positive data from the extension phase of the SOLUTION study earlier in March.The company currently has no approved products. Hence, the successful development of these candidates is crucial for its portfolio boost.Anthera Pharmaceuticals, Inc. PriceAnthera Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price | Anthera Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

1167,LLY,"Novo Nordisk A/S’ (NVO  -  Free Report) shares gained 1.1% on Friday after it announced that the FDA has approved the label expansion of Victoza. The drug is now approved as a treatment to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular (CV) events including heart attack, stroke and CV death, in adults with type II diabetes and established CV disease.Victoza is a once-daily human glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue approved for the treatment of type II diabetes in adults. The drug is one of the main revenue contributors for the company with sales of $1.85 billion in the first half of 2017.Novo Nordisk’s shares have outperformed the industry year to date. The stock rallied 28.7% compared with the industry’s gain of 10.9%, over the same time frame.We note that the FDA’s approval was based on data from the pivotal LEADER study on CV outcomes, which evaluated the drug in more than 9,300 people with type II diabetes at high risk of major CV events. The study evaluated the drug in combination with standard-of-care over a period of up to five years. The data from the study demonstrated that Victoza significantly reduced the risk of CV death. The drug lowered the risk of non-fatal heart attack or non-fatal stroke by 13% compared to placebo and showed an absolute risk reduction of 1.9%.Per one study, CV disease is a leading cause for death in diabetic patients. With the addition of new indication to its label, Victoza is expected to bring in more revenues as it can now be prescribed for diabetes medication that also reduces the patient's CV risk.However, last year the FDA approved Eli Lilly and Company’s (LLY  -  Free Report) label expansion for the diabetes drug, Jardiance, to include CV risk reduction data. The drug with the updated label has already been launched in January 2017, which increases competition for Victoza.Moreover, other companies like Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) and AstraZeneca plc (AZN  -  Free Report) are also developing their drug for the same indication. Notably, Merck was denied approval by the FDA in April 2017 to include CV outcomes data from the TECOS study on the labels of Januvia. Also, AstraZeneca’s Bydureon failed to reduce CV risk in a phase IIIb/IV CV outcomes study, EXSCEL.Novo Nordisk A/S Price and Consensus  Novo Nordisk A/S Price and Consensus | Novo Nordisk A/S QuoteNovo Nordisk currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

J&J reported mixed second-quarter results, beating on earnings but missing on sales.  This was the third consecutive sales miss for J&J due to a a slowdown in pharmaceutical product sales. However, J&J is optimistic that sales growth will accelerate in the second half of 2017.

However, Sandoz’s performance was disappointing due to pricing pressure.Here we have three pharma giants that are set to report second-quarter results on Jul 25.

Pre-clinical proof-of-principle studies will be conducted by Topas, which will receive R&D funding from Lilly. Lilly has an option to in-license and develop all candidates produced under the collaboration. The deal signifies Lilly’s focus on immunology. Immune tolerance has been attracting the interest of quite a few large players with Celgene signing an exclusive global research collaboration with Anokion, a privately held company developing novel tolerance-inducing therapeutics for autoimmune diseases, earlier this year.AstraZeneca in mRNA-Focused Deal with Ethris: AstraZeneca entered into a strategic deal with Germany-based Ethris for the development of mRNA therapies for respiratory diseases. The five-year strategic research deal will be focused on the use of Ethris’ proprietary SNIM RNA technology for new stabilized non-immunogenic mRNA therapies for respiratory diseases.AstraZeneca will make an upfront payment of €25 million upfront and provide research funding as well. Other payments include research and development milestone payments and sales related royalties upon commercialization. AstraZeneca has the option to take exclusive worldwide licenses for each target under the collaboration. This is not the first time that AstraZeneca has signed an mRNA-focused deal.

1170,LLY,"This week, companies like Allergan (AGN  -  Free Report), Teva (TEVA  -  Free Report) and Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report) were in the limelight. While Mylan and Teva were in the news related to the FDA approval of Mylan’s generic versions of Teva’s top-selling branded drug, Copaxone, Allergan is under fire for its agreement with the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe for Restasis.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesAllergan’s Restasis Deal under Fire: Allergan’s deal with the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe, announced early in September, has come under fire with lawmakers questioning the unconventional move adopted by the company to protect its blockbuster eye drug, Restasis, from generic competition. Under the terms of the deal, Allergan transferred six patents related to Restasis to the Tribe while being granted exclusive licenses to the patents. In return, Allergan will pay $13.75 million upon execution of the agreement as well as annual royalties of $15 million.Restasis is Allergan’s second best-selling drug bringing in sales of almost $1.5 billion in 2016. While one of the original patents on the drug's active ingredient was set to expire in 2014, Allergan filed additional patents extending protection to 2024.Lawmakers pointed out that the sovereign status of Native American tribes would make any patent challenges lengthy and complex as tribes may be immune from the legal claims made by generic drug makers to challenge patents. In fact, the Tribe is filing to dismiss the ongoing inter partes review (“IPR”) of the Restasis patents based on their sovereign immunity from IPR challenges.The deal has basically raised concerns that it will curb generic competition in the pharmaceutical industry and discourage generic drugmakers from making cheaper copy-cat versions of expensive drugs.Allergan has been asked by the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform to provide certain documents and information about the deal by Oct 17, 2017.Mylan’s Gain, Teva’s Loss: In a major development, Mylan gained FDA approval for its generic version of Teva’s top-selling branded drug, Copaxone, for multiple sclerosis. Mylan gained approval for the 40 mg (thrice weekly) dosage as well as the once-daily 20 mg formulation. With Mylan being among the first applicants to challenge the 40 mg patent, the company could, therefore, enjoy 180 days of exclusivity though a formal communication from the FDA regarding the same is yet to come. Mylan has launched both products. According to QuintilesIMS, brand sales for the 20 mg and 40 mg doses were approximately $700 million and $3.64 billion, respectively, for the 12 months ending Jul 31, 2017. Mylan also gained approval for the 40 mg dose in the EU.While the FDA approval of generic Copaxone is a big boost for Mylan, it is a major blow for Teva which is currently facing a whole lot of challenges. Teva issued a statement saying that the launch of the 40 mg formulation before the final resolution of pending patent infringement lawsuits with Mylan will be treated as an “at-risk” launch which means Mylan would have to pay significant damages if the court upholds the patents protecting the drug.The entry of the 40 mg formulation and the entry of a second generic version of the 20 mg formulation (Sandoz and Momenta have been on the market for quite a while with Glatopa, a generic version of the 20 mg dose) is expected to cut Teva’s 4Q earnings by at least 25 cents per share. Additional details should be out when the company announces third quarter results on November 2. The entry of generic Copaxone just adds to the existing list of problems being faced by Teva (Read more: Teva Shares Plummet After Mylan's Copaxone Generic Gets FDA Approval).Novo Nordisk Gets FDA Approval for Fiasp: Novo Nordisk (NVO  -  Free Report), which has a strong presence in the diabetes market, provided some regulatory updates on its diabetes franchise. The company gained FDA approval for Fiasp, a fast-acting mealtime insulin, for the treatment of adults with diabetes. The approval process was not exactly smooth with the company receiving a complete response letter last year when the agency had asked for additional information related to the assay for the immunogenicity and clinical pharmacology data (Read more: Novo Nordisk's Fiasp Gets FDA Nod for Diabetes in Adults).Meanwhile, the European Medicines Agency’s (“EMA”) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”) endorsed the company’s plan to update the EU label of Tresiba to include results from the DEVOTE study showing a significant reduction in the risk of severe hypoglycemia.Novo Nordisk is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock - you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Sanofi/Regeneron Score a Win in PCSK9 Inhibitor Litigation: Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report) and partner Regeneron got a major boost with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ordering a new trial related to Amgen’s claims regarding patents for PCSK9 inhibitors. The court also vacated the permanent injunction in the lawsuit which means Sanofi and Regeneron can continue selling their PCSK9 inhibitor, Praluent, in the United States.Favorable Court Ruling for Lilly: Another company that got a positive ruling on the patent front is Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report). The company said that the Patent Trial and Appeal Board of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“PTO”) ruled in its favor regarding the vitamin regimen patent for cancer therapy, Alimta (pemetrexed for injection). If the patent is upheld, Alimta will be safe from generic competition until May 2022. This decision has removed an overhang on the shares. Alimta brought in sales of more than a billion dollars in the first half of 2017.This week, Lilly also gained FDA approval for a new cancer treatment, Verzenio, for use in women with HR+, HER2- advanced breast cancer.Lilly has gained 19.2% year to date, compared to the 17.9% rally of the industry it belongs to.PerformanceLarge Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % Return Large Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % ReturnThe NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index gained 1.9% so far this week. Among major stocks, Lilly is up 3.1%.

1171,LLY,"Eli Lilly & Company (LLY  -  Free Report) announced that it has received a favorable ruling from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) in a dispute related to the vitamin regimen patent on its key cancer drug, Alimta (pemetrexed disodium).In an inter partes review (IPR) ruling, the U.S. PTO validated the Alimta vitamin regimen patent, thereby removing a major overhang for Lilly. Markedly, the IPR was initiated by Neptune Generics and Sandoz, the generic arm of Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report).We remind investors that in January this year, the U.S. Court of Appeals ruled in favor of Lilly in a lawsuit against generic drugmaker Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA  -  Free Report) regarding the validity and infringement of the same patent, confirming the earlier decisions by a district court. The U.S. PTO’s IPR ruling is consistent with these previous Alimta decisions.So far this year, Lilly’s share price has risen 19.1% comparing favorably with industry’s growth of 17.9%.  Although the compound patent covering Alimta in the United States expired in January this year, the vitamin regimen patent will remain valid till June 2021 (plus pediatric exclusivity expiring in 2022), if Alimta’s patent is ultimately upheld through all the remaining challenges.  The compound patent has already expired in major European countries and Japan in Dec 2015.More than ten generic manufacturers including Teva and Sandoz are seeking approvals in the United States to market generic forms of Alimta prior to the expiration of its vitamin regimen patents.Notably, Alimta is one of the top revenue grossers at Lilly and a longer commercial life for Alimta would provide top-line support as several products in Lilly’s portfolio are already facing patent expiration.The entry of generic competition for Alimta following the loss of effective patent protection will cause a rapid decline in revenues for the product.In the first half of 2017, Alimta sales declined 13% year over year to $1.02 billion. Outside the United States, the sales of this cancer drug are being hurt due to loss of exclusivity in several countries. However, its U.S. sales are being affected by increased competition owing to the entry of immuno-oncology agents in the market. The favourable IPR narrows down the chances of generic competition to Alimta, which could have hurt sales more.Lilly carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.A better-ranked large cap drug company from the same space is Pfizer, Inc. (PFE) holding a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1172,LLY,"Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share of $1.05, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.03 per share by 1.9%. Earnings rose 19% from the year-ago quarter backed by volume driven pharma sales growth and higher operating profits.Revenues BeatQuarterly revenues of $5.66 billion also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.52 billion by 2.5%. Sales grew 9% year over year backed by strong performance of the new drugs as well as Lilly’s diabetes products. Lilly’s diabetes products recorded revenue growth of 39% worldwide.Volumes rose 7% as a strong performance of new products like Trulicity, Taltz, Basaglar, Jardiance and Lartruvo offset decline in sales of established products like Zyprexa, Alimta, Cialis, Strattera and Effient. Higher realized prices for several drugs also contributed 2% to sales growth in the quarter.Revenue in DetailPharmaceutical revenues rose 10% in the quarter backed by 14% volume growth of the new products.While U.S. revenues grew 9% to $3.1 billion, ex-U.S. revenues rose 8% to $2.55 billion.Established products that recorded growth during the quarter include Forteo (up 13% to $441.7 million) and Humalog (up 9% to $696.2 million). Sales of all other established products declined in the quarter.Alimta sales declined 10% to $514.5 million, reflecting lower demand in the United States due to competitive pressure, mainly from immuno-oncology agents. Outside the United States., sales of Alimta were hurt by loss of exclusivity in several countries, increased competition and lower realized prices.Zyprexa sales declined 6% to $140.6 million due to loss of exclusivity.Humulin sales decreased 7% in the quarter to $300.5 million due to lower realized prices and unfavorable buying patterns in China.Cialis sales declined 4% to $564.9 million hurt by lower demand in the United States as well as increased competition from generic sildenafilErbitux sales declined 11% to $163.5 million in the quarter. Strattera sales declined 31% to $137.1 million. Cymbalta sales declined 42% to $183.2 million. Effient sales declined 56% to $55.9 million in the quarter.Among the new products, Trulicity generated revenues of $527.7 million, up 117% year over year, with U.S. revenues benefiting from growth in the GLP-1 market and market share gains.Cyramza revenues were $196.0 million, up 23% year over year, backed by continued strong outside U.S. revenues and improved U.S. revenues. Cyramza’s ex-U.S. revenues benefited from strong volumes in Japan. U.S. revenues increased 4% driven by increased volume.Jardiance sales (up 168% to $127.2 million) were driven by increased market share within the growing SGLT2 class.Basaglar recorded revenues of $145.7 million compared with $86.6 million in the previous quarter backed by strong launch uptake. Basaglar - Lilly and partner Boehringer Ingelheim’s follow-on insulin to Sanofi’s (SNY  -  Free Report) blockbuster drug, Lantus - was launched in the United States in mid-December 2016 where it generated revenues of $115.2 million in the quarter.Taltz brought in sales of $151.3 million compared with $138.7 million in the previous quarter, reflecting strong launch uptake.Lartruvo (olaratumab) generated revenues of $54.5 million in the third quarter of 2017 compared with $47.4 million in the previous quarter. Lartruvo was launched in the United States and the EU for soft tissue sarcoma in the fourth quarter of 2016.Lilly and partner Incyte Corporation’s (INCY  -  Free Report) rheumatoid arthritis (RA) drug Olumiant (baricitinib) has been launched in select European countries and in Japan. The drug generated sales of $16.2 million in the third quarter of 2017 compared with $4.8 million in the previous quarter backed by strong launch uptake in Germany.However, in the United States, Lilly received a complete response letter (CRL) from the FDA for baricitinib in April for want of additional data. In August, Lilly and Incyte announced that they will re-submit the NDA for baricitinib much faster than previously expected. The NDA is expected to be re-submitted before the end of January next year.Lilly's Elanco Animal Health segment sales rose 5% to $740.6 million due to inclusion of revenues from the acquisition of Boehringer Ingelheim Vetmedica's U.S. feline, canine and rabies (acquired in January 2017). However, worldwide competitive pressure continued to hurt sales in the segment.Concurrent with the earnings release, Lilly said that it is exploring strategic alternatives for the Elanco Animal Health business including a sale, merger or creating a separate company through an initial public offer. A decision regarding the same is expected to be made no later than the middle of next year and Lilly may ultimately opt to retain the business.Gross Margin Down but Operating Income RisesAdjusted gross margin of 75.1% in the quarter decreased 130 basis points as manufacturing efficiencies were offset by negative product mix and the effect of foreign exchange rates on international inventories sold.Operating income increased 18% to $1.38 billion. Total operating expenses, as a percent of revenues, declined 310 basis points in the quarter to 50.8%.2017 Outlook UppedLilly raised its previously issued 2017 adjusted earnings and sales outlook for the second time this year. Adjusted earnings per share are now expected in the range of $4.15 to $4.25 compared with $4.10 to $4.20 expected previously. Revenues are expected in the range of $22.4 billion and $22.7 billion, up from $22.0–$22.5 billion expected previously.Gross margin is expected to be approximately 76%, same as previously expected. Adjusted tax rate is still expected to be approximately 21% (previously approximately 22%).Marketing, selling and administrative expenses are still expected in the range of $6.4–$6.6 billion, while research and development expenses are projected to be $5.1-$5.2 billion compared with $5.0-$5.2 billion expected previously.Our TakeLilly’s third-quarter 2017 results were strong with the company beating estimates on both counts. The pharma giant also raised its sales and earnings outlook for the year. The increase in revenue guidance was supported by strong uptake trends of the new products and also, to some extent, due to the positive impact of Euro.Shares were up 2.6% in pre-market trading. So far this year, Lilly’s share price has risen 18.5% compared with an increase of 20.2% for the industry.Going forward, new products like Trulicity, Taltz, Basaglar, Cyramza, Jardiance and Lartruvo are expected to see higher revenues. Lilly also expects some established products like Trajenta, Forteo and Humalog to continue doing well. Lilly is also progressing well with its pipeline. Earlier this month, Lilly gained FDA approval for Verzenio (abemaciclib), a CDK 4/6 inhibitor for metastatic breast cancer. Since 2014, Lilly has launched nine medicines, including Verzenio and plans to launch eleven more by 2023.However, Alimta will continue to be impacted by competition. Other headwinds include competition from immuno-oncology agents as well as loss of exclusivity for many drugs in emerging markets.Lilly carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.  Biogen Inc. (BIIB  -  Free Report), which also reported third-quarter results today, beat estimates for both earnings and sales. However, its shares were down more than 2% in pre-market trading as sales of its multiple sclerosis drug Tecfidera declined sequentially in the quarter.Eli Lilly and Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Eli Lilly and Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Eli Lilly and Company QuoteToday's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

1173,LLY,"The pharmaceutical sector has been grabbing investors’ attention of late with the NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index gaining 13.1% and the Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry 20.7% year to date, outpacing 14.7% gain for the S&P 500. New drug approvals and tax reforms are expected to provide a further impetus to the stocks. However, factors like drug pricing and competition from biosimilars will continue to act as major deterrents. On the other hand, companies like Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) are resorting to workforce reduction for a leaner cost structure. On the M&A front, apart from Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) acquisition of Actelion Ltd in June, nothing much has happened in this space. Merck & Co (MRK  -  Free Report) recently announced that it will acquire Germany-based Rigontec, a privately held immuno-oncology focused biotech to boost its immune-oncology pipeline. Nevertheless, the proposed tax reforms are expected to boost cash balances of the companies which in turn can be used for mergers/acquisitions.Here we have picked four of the largest drug companies which look well poised for growth and can be a prudent choice for adding to one’s portfolio:Based in Switzerland, Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) is one of the leaders in health care solutions with a wide array of drugs and services. Novartis has a presence in the field of oncology, neuroscience, ophthalmology and generics. Novartis has a strong oncology portfolio of drugs like Afinitor, Exjade, Jakavi, Zykadia, Tasigna, Jadenu and an improved formulation of Exjade.The recent FDA approval of Kisqali for advanced or metastatic breast cancer and breakthrough gene transfer treatment, Kymriah suspension for acute lymphoblastic leukemia has further boosted the portfolio. The approval is a major boost for Novartis given the potential in the CAR T therapy space.Growth drivers like Cosentyx and Entresto more than offset the impact of generic erosion, mainly due to Glivec. Cosentyx achieved blockbuster status in 2016. We believe that the approval of new drugs and label expansion of existing ones should boost the top line going forward. Novartis currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Novartis’ stock has gained 21.8% year to date. Strength in oncology drugs and the approval of the first CAR T therapy should continue to boost performance. Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report), one of the leading pharmaceutical companies in the United States, focuses on the development and commercialization of a wide range of products including human and animal biologic as well as small molecule medicines and vaccines, along with consumer health care products. Pfizer is looking to drive growth through licensing deals and collaborative agreements.The company is looking to expand the labels of approved drugs like Ibrance, Xeljanz, Xalkori and Eliquis. Pfizer also boasts a strong pipeline. Moreover, Pfizer is evaluating various biosimilar molecules in several stages of development given the potential in the market. Shares of the company have moved up 9.3%, in the last three months comparing favorably with the industry’s gain. Pfizer presently carries a Zacks Rank #2. Earnings estimates of the company for 2017 have been static over the past 60 days. Bagsværd, Denmark-based Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO  -  Free Report) is a global leader in the diabetes market. The company is also a key player in hemophilia care, growth hormone therapy, hormone replacement therapy and obesity. The company’s portfolio includes drugs like Levemir, NovoRapid, Victoza, NovoMix 30, NovoMix 50, NovoMix 70, NovoSeven, NovoThirteen and Norditropin.Additionally, obesity drug, Saxenda (liraglutide 3 mg) was launched in the United States in 2015 and its uptake has been encouraging. Victoza is currently the market leader in the GLP-1 segment and we expect Victoza to continue being a significant contributor to the company’s top line. In August, the FDA approved a new indication for Victoza to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular (CV) events in adults with type II diabetes and established CV disease.We believe the label expansion of drugs will further boost the top line. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #2. The company’s shares have rallied 40.5% year to date. The company’s earnings estimates for 2017 have moved up 3% over the last 60 days. Headquartered in Leverkusen, Germany, Bayer AG (BAYRY  -  Free Report) is a life science company with core competencies in the areas of health care and agriculture.  Bayer has been consistently making efforts to transform into a pure life science company. Drugs launched over the last few quarters are expected to continue to drive the top line.  Bayer is looking for a label expansion of its oncology drug Stivarga, which is approved for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer and metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumors.The company has inked several strategic deals and undertook meaningful acquisitions in the recent past. Bayer is looking to acquire Monsanto in an all-cash transaction and the combined business is expected to boost Bayer’s Crop Science business and provide accretion to its bottom-line.Bayer currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The company’s shares have gained 35.1% year to date. Earnings estimates for 2017 of the company have moved north 3.2% over the last 60 days. Bottom Line  Challenges in the form of pricing pressure and competition will remain in the healthcare sector. Nevertheless, picking some outperformers from the space, backed by a solid Zacks Rank and positive price movement could lead investors to gain this earnings season.4 Stocks to Watch After the Massive Equifax HackCybersecurity stocks spiked on recent news of a data breach affecting 143 million Americans.

1174,LLY,"Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) announced that it has submitted a supplemental new drug application (sNDA) to the FDA for the label expansion of its diabetes drug Invokana (to include the cardiovascular indication based on data from a large CANVAS outcomes program.The application, to include the indication of risk reduction of cardiovascular events in type II diabetes patients, also applies to Invokana’s fixed-dose combinations, Invokamet and Invokamet XR.The filing was based on data from the CANVAS Program which evaluated Invokana- a SGLT2 inhibitor compared with placebo on CV events in type II diabetes patients who have established cardiovascular (CV) disease or are at risk for CV disease. The primary endpoint of the study was defined as major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), which included CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction and nonfatal stroke. The study showed that Invokana was successful in reducing the risks of heart attacks and strokes. The CANVAS program comprised two, nearly-identical large outcomes studies called CANVAS and CANVAS-R. However, the study also showed that the drug increased the risk of amputations.So far this year, Johnson & Johnson’s share price has increased 14.7% comparing unfavorably with a gain of 17.6% recorded by the industry it belongs to.Many pharma companies are working hard to get the labels of their diabetes medicines updated to include their cardiovascular benefits. With death from cardiovascular diseases being significantly higher in adults with diabetes compared to those without diabetes, the addition of positive CV outcomes on labels of diabetes drugs can give sales a shot in the arm.Eli Lilly & Company (LLY  -  Free Report) received FDA approval last year to include CV risk reduction data from the EMPA-REG OUTCOME study on the label of Jardiance. The updated label including the cardiovascular indication was launched in Jan 2017 while the American Diabetes Association (ADA) has also updated its diabetes treatment guidelines. The European Commission also approved the Jardiance label update for the cardiovascular indication in 2016.In August 2017, Novo Nordisk’s (NVO  -  Free Report) Victoza (liraglutide)  was approved by the FDA for  a new indication to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular (CV) events in adults with type II diabetes and established CV disease. The FDA's decision was based on the results from the landmark LEADER trial, which demonstrated that Victoza statistically significantly reduced the risk of cardiovascular death, non-fatal heart attack or non-fatal stroke by 13% versus  placebo, when added to standard of care, with an absolute risk reduction of 1.9%.However, in May, Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) was denied approval by the FDA to include cardiovascular outcomes data from the TECOS study on the labels of its DPP-IV inhibitor Januvia (sitagliptin) and other medicines containing Januvia.AstraZeneca’s Bydureon also failed to reduce cardiovascular risk in a phase IIIb/IV cardiovascular outcomes study, EXSCEL.Johnson & Johnson Price Johnson & Johnson Price | Johnson & Johnson QuoteJohnson & Johnson carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

1175,LLY,"Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) announced a number of leadership changes in order to focus on bringing newer drugs to the market. In this regard, the company promoted Josh Smiley to the post of Chief Financial Officer (CFO) effective Jan 1, 2018. In June 2017, the company announced that its current CFO, Derica Rice, would retire at year-end.The company also promoted Dan Skovronsky to senior vice president for the Science And Technology and President of Lilly Research Labs. The change will be effective June 1, 2018.Also, Myles O'Neill has been promoted to Senior Vice President and President of Manufacturing Operations while Aarti Shah, who is a Senior Vice President and Chief Information Officer, has been offered the post of an executive officer.All four of them will become a part of Lilly's executive committee. In addition to these appointments, the company also announced two retirements of Maria Crowe, President of Manufacturing Operations, who will retire in December after 35 years of service. Jan Lundberg, Vice President for Science and Technology and President of Lilly Research Labs, will retire at the end of May 2018 after eight years with Lilly.So far this year, Lilly’s share price has increased 16.3% compared with the industry’s gain of 16.4%.We note that the company has made these changes in order to focus on new medicines in diabetes, cancer, immunology, neurodegeneration and pain. Last month, the company also announced some restructuring initiatives in order to streamline its operations so that it can focus on developing new medicines and improve its cost structure. It announced plans to reduce its global workforce by approximately 3,500 positions. These initiatives are expected to amass annualized savings of approximately $500 million, beginning 2018.Furthermore, it is also closing down several sites, a plant in Iowa, a R&D office in New Jersey and a R&D center in China to save costs.However, the company faces its share of challenges. Several key drugs in its portfolio like Zyprexa and Cymbalta are facing generic competition due to loss of exclusivity. Meanwhile, blockbuster drug, Alimta’s U.S. sales are also being affected by the entry of immuno-oncology agents in the market while outside the United States sales are already being hurt due to loss of exclusivity in several countries.Other headwinds include competition from immuno-oncology agents as well as recent high-profile pipeline setbacks. Also, Lilly’s Animal Health segment did not do too well in the first half due to worldwide competitive pressure.Eli Lilly and Company Price Eli Lilly and Company Price | Eli Lilly and Company QuoteZacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderLilly carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1176,LLY,"We issued an updated report on Zoetis, Inc. (ZTS  -  Free Report) on Aug 18.Zoetis boasts a robust and diversified product portfolio. The company’s business is divided into five categories – anti-infectives, vaccines, parasiticides, medicated feed additives and other pharmaceuticals. Zoetis markets its offerings primarily across eight core species – cattle, swine, poultry, sheep and fish (collectively, livestock) and dogs, cats and horses (collectively, companion animals).Zoetis derives a majority of its revenues from a diversified product portfolio of medicines and vaccines that are used to treat and protect livestock and companion animals. The company continues to strengthen its diverse portfolio of products through lifecycle innovations, strong customer relationships, and access to new markets and technologies. Apoquel and other product launches continue to drive growth in companion animal portfolio.The company expects to witness stronger growth from its companion animal portfolio in 2017 driven by its dermatology portfolio, Apoquel and Cytopoint, further penetration of Simparica, and ongoing uptake of new vaccines.  Latest data shows that 55% of dogs with dermatology problems in the U.S. are treated with Apoquel or Cytopoint, up from 52% in the first quarter.In addition, new approvals further boost portfolio. Zoetis received approval for Clavamox Chewable in the U.S. in May 2017, Cytopoint in the European Union in April and in Canada in March.Zoetis stock has moved up 13.5% in the year so far compared with the industry’s loss of 3.5%.However, disease outbreak among animals is a concern for Zoetis’ livestock products. Such outbreaks may hurt regional or global sales of particular animal-derived food products or result in reduced exports of the same, either due to heightened export restrictions or import prohibitions, in turn, dampening demand for livestock products.Moreover, Zoetis faces stiff competition from other animal health medicines and vaccines companies like Merck Animal Health, the animal health division of Merck & Co (MRK  -  Free Report), Elanco, the animal health division of Eli Lilly and Co. (LLY  -  Free Report), Bayer Animal Health, the animal health division of Bayer AG (BAYRY  -  Free Report) and Boehringer Ingelheim Animal Health (the animal health division of Boehringer Ingelheim).Zacks Rank Zoetis currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1177,LLY,"Novo Nordisk (NVO  -  Free Report) announced results from SUSTAIN 7 study, which showed that people with type II diabetes who are treated with once-weekly semaglutide experienced superior reduction in HbA1c and body weight compared with treatment with Eli Lilly and Co's (LLY  -  Free Report) Trulicity (dulaglutide).  when added to metformin.In fact, semaglutide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue being evaluated for the treatment of adults with type II diabetes. Currently, it is under review by seven regulatory agencies, including the FDA, the European Medicines Agency, and the Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency.Shares of the company have rallied 27.1% compared with the Zacks classified industry’s gain of 11.2% on a year-to-date basis.Notably, the 40-week study evaluated the efficacy and safety of two dosages of semaglutide, in addition to initial standard-of-care therapy metformin against dulaglutide plus metformin. While 0.5 mg semaglutide was compared with 0.75 dulaglutide, 1.0 mg semaglutide was compared with 1.5 mg dulaglutide, when added to metformin.The study presented that both the doses of semaglutide are statistically significant, and results in superior reduction of HbA1c. In addition, it showed people treated with both the doses of semaglutide experienced a statistically significant and superior weight loss at both doses.Meanwhile, the superior glucose control and weight loss achieved with semaglutide compared to dulaglutide were consistent with the entire SUSTAIN program. In fact, the results revealed the potential of semaglutide to set a new standard for treatment of type II diabetes.Novo Nordisk has a strong pipeline, primarily focusing on therapeutic proteins within insulin, GLP-1, blood clotting factors and human growth hormone. The company is making efforts to develop new treatments for diabetes, which is its core area of expertise. Key pipeline candidates include semaglutide and nonacog beta pegol.

1178,LLY,"Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has granted a tentative approval to Lusduna Nexvue, the company’s biosimilar version of Sanofi’s (SNY  -  Free Report) Lantus (insulin glargine) for treatment of people with type I and type II diabetes. Lusduna Nexvue delivers insulin in a pre-filled dosing device.Note that the candidate was formerly known as MK-1293. The FDA has granted a provisional approval to its trade name Lusduna Nexvue, to be used once the product is made available in the U.S.Merck’s shares have underperformed the industry so far this year. The stock has gained 6.9% compared with the broader industry’s increase of 13.2%.Though Lusduna met all the regulatory safety and efficacy standards, the approval is tentative due to an ongoing litigation with Sanofi. The final approval of Lusduna is subject to a resolution of the Sanofi litigation.In September last year, Sanofi sued Merck for patent infringement on Lantus. The litigation automatically invoked a stay on the final FDA approval of Lusduna for up to 30 months, or in the event, a court rules in favor of Merck, whichever is sooner. Notably, Lantus has been a major contributor to the Sanofi’s top line having accounted for 14.1% of the total sales in 2016.However, the company considers the conditional approval as a significant milestone as it is advancing the candidate another step closer to the market.We remind investors that Merck is developing Lusduna in collaboration with Samsung Bioepis. Under the agreement terms, Merck is responsible for clinical development, manufacturing and commercialization, while Bioepis is partially funding the development.Currently, an application for regulatory approval of Lusduna for treatment of patients with type I and type II diabetes is under review in the EU.We remind investors that Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) is already marketing a “follow-on” insulin glargine product, Basalgar, since Dec 2016.In a separate press release, Merck announced a collaboration with Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) modernization of pharmaceutical packaging with the introduction of corning valor glass that enhances the storage and delivery of drug formulations.Merck & Company, Inc.

1179,LLY,"Second quarter earnings season for the pharma sector kicked off this week with industry bellwether Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) and Swiss pharma giant, Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report), reporting results. Meanwhile, Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) gained tentative approval from the FDA for its follow-on biologic basal insulin though the company cannot launch immediately due to an ongoing patent infringement case.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesA Look at J&J and Novartis’ 2Q Results: Industry bellwether J&J and Swiss pharma giant, Novartis, both reported second quarter results earlier this week. J&J surpassed earnings expectations though revenues fell short. The company raised its outlook for the year with operational sales growth expected to accelerate in the second half. Some of the factors that should help this include the earlier launch of Tremfya, a more moderate erosion of the U.S. Remicade business compared to previous expectations as well as the continued strong performance of key drugs. Contribution from new products in the Medical Devices segment is also expected to pick up in the back half of the year with strong growth in the Vision Care segment expected to continue. The Consumer segment, however, will continue to be impacted by weaker macroeconomic dynamics (Read more: J&J Beats on Q2 Earnings, Lags Sales, Ups 2017 View).Novartis’ second quarter results were better than expected with the company beating on both earnings and revenues. Entresto and Cosentyx continued to perform well while Sandoz sales declined reflecting pricing pressure in the U.S. Meanwhile, Alcon’s performance improved encouraging the company to raise its Alcon sales outlook to low single digit growth (Read more: Novartis Tops Q2 Earnings, Sandoz Faces Pricing Pressure). Novartis stock has gained 17.3% year to date, outperforming the 12.2% rally of the industry it belongs to.Tentative Approval for Merck’s Follow-On Basal Insulin: Merck got tentative approval from the FDA for its biosimilar version of Sanofi’s (SNY  -  Free Report) blockbuster diabetes drug, Lantus. Lusduna Nexvue (insulin glargine injection), technically a follow-on biologic basal insulin, has been developed by Merck with funding from Samsung Bioepis.However, Merck will have to wait before it can launch the product due to an automatic 30-month stay resulting from a patent infringement lawsuit initiated by Sanofi in Sep 2016. Merck cannot launch its product before the expiry of the stay period or a favorable court ruling, whichever occurs first.We note that a biosimilar version of Lantus is already on the market in the form of Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) and Boehringer Ingelheim’s Basaglar which entered the market in mid-Dec 2016. Lantus sales declined 14.1% in the first quarter of 2017 including a 20.9% decline in the U.S. reflecting lower average net price, patient switches to Toujeo and the impact of formulary exclusions. Pricing pressure will increase once Merck’s product enters the market.Sanofi and Merck are both Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stocks.

With this deal, Sanofi will gain access to certain Nanobodies in Ablynx’s existing portfolio as well as to Ablynx’s scientists and proprietary Nanobody platform. Sanofi will make an upfront payment of €23 million. Other financial details include up to €2.4 billion in milestone payments as well as tiered royalties. With this collaboration, Sanofi is looking to expand its drug discovery pipeline in immunology.EU Nod for AstraZeneca’s Kyntheum: AstraZeneca’s (AZN  -  Free Report) psoriasis treatment Kyntheum gained approval in the EU plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The company said that its partner LEO Pharma gained approval for the use of the biologic medicine for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy.Kyntheum was approved in the U.S. under the trade name Siliq in Feb 2017 with a black box warning regarding risk in patients with suicidal thoughts or behavior.PerformanceLarge Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % Return Large Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % ReturnThe NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index gained 1.8% over the last five trading sessions.

1180,LLY,"Biogen Inc. (BIIB  -  Free Report), a well-known name in the multiple sclerosis (MS) market, will report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 25, before the market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 4.63%.Biogen’s shares have declined 0.4% this year so far while the Zacks classified Biomed-Genetics industry recorded an increase of 8.8%.Biogen’s earnings performance has been pretty impressive so far, having delivered back-to-back positive surprises. The average earnings beat over the last four quarters is 5.29%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderAt the first quarter call, the company had said that it expects relatively stable demand for both Tecfidera and Tysabri (its multiple sclerosis drugs) in 2017 as patient growth in ex-U.S. markets offsets the modest decline in the U.S. due to rising competition from drugs like Roche’s Ocrevus. It remains to be seen whether its second-quarter performance reflects the trend.Meanwhile, the combined number of patients using Avonex and Plegridy is on the decline as patients transition to other oral multiple sclerosis therapies or other high-efficacy products.Zinbryta, launched in collaboration with AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) in Aug 2016, is expected to continue to contribute to revenues in the U.S. and the EU. The drug benefits from increased use of high-efficacy products.Spinraza approved for spinal muscular atrophy in Dec 2016 was off to a promising start backed by robust underlying demand Notably, Spinraza, which added $47.4 million to the top line in the first quarter of 2017, should contribute further to sales. At the Q1 conference call, the company had said that it is working on expanding access to Spinraza to all patients.However, at the call, the company had warned of possible logistics and coverage restriction on the drug in the U.S. as well as other markets. We expect management to provide an update on the issue at its second quarter conference call.Biogen’s biosimilar products - Flixabi (a biosimilar referencing Remicade) and Benepali (a biosimilar referencing Enbrel) are also generating higher revenues. The trend should continue this quarter as well.Headcount reduction and restructuring initiatives are expected to continue to lower operating expenses. Meanwhile, R&D expenses are expected to increase due to increased business development payments.At the second quarter call, investor focus will remain on Tecfidera’s scrip trends, sales ramp-up of Spinraza, pipeline progress and acquisition plans.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Biogen is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Its Earnings ESP is -5.61% as the Most Accurate estimate stands at $4.21 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher at $4.46. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Biogen’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings beat.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Biogen Inc.

1181,LLY,"Radius Health, Inc. (RDUS  -  Free Report) announced that the first patient has been enroled in the phase I study on pipeline candidate, RAD140.RAD140 is a nonsteroidal selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM) which is being evaluated for the treatment of hormone receptor positive breast cancer. The phase I trial is a safety and dose-ranging study in approximately 40 patients suffering from progressive metastatic or locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Postmenopausal women with metastatic hormone receptor positive breast cancer will receive escalating doses of RAD140 by oral administration over a period of 28 days in part A of the study. The primary safety outcomes include rate of dose-limiting toxicities, adverse events related to treatment and tolerability as measured by dose interruptions or adjustments. In addition, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and tumor response will also be evaluated.The SARM mechanism of action is differentiated from both selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) and selective estrogen receptor degraders (SERDs). Consequently, RAD140 has significant potential to complement future applications of elacestrant (RAD1901) by targeting distinct mechanisms of endocrine resistance.We note that an investigational new drug application submitted to the FDA for RAD140 has been accepted. Radius’ share price has increased 1.4% year to date compared with the industry’s 4.6% gain.In April the FDA approved Tymlos (abaloparatide-SC) for the treatment of postmenopausal women with high risk osteoporosis for fracture — defined as history of osteoporotic fracture — multiple risk factors for fracture, or patients who have failed or are intolerant to other osteoporosis therapies. Although the osteoporosis market in the United States holds great promise as approximately 1.4 million postmenopausal women suffer osteoporotic fracture each year, Tymlos is expected to face significant competition from Eli Lilly &Co's (LLY  -  Free Report) Forteo and Amgen Inc's (AMGN  -  Free Report) Prolia. Moreover, the approved label carries a boxed warning of osteosarcoma (a malignant bone tumor). The company, however, suffered a setback when the CHMP issued a second Day-180 List of Outstanding Issues.Meanwhile, Radius clinical pipeline includes an investigational abaloparatide transdermal patch for potential use in osteoporosis and the investigational drug elacestrant (RAD1901) for potential use in hormone-driven and/or hormone-resistant breast cancer, and vasomotor symptoms in postmenopausal women.Zacks Rank & Key PickRadius Health currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1182,LLY,"On Sep 26, 2017, we issued an updated report on Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR  -  Free Report), a biopharmaceutical company, focused on developing treatments, utilizing PEGylation and advanced polymer conjugate technology platforms.The company’s portfolio comprises two drugs — Movantik for opioid-induced constipation (OIC) and Adynovate for treating hemophilia A. Both drugs are showing impressive performance.Nektar shares a global license agreement with AstraZeneca (AZN  -  Free Report) under which, the latter was granted worldwide, exclusive, rights to develop, market and sell for Movantik as well as fixed-dose combination products.The company also has a licensing, collaboration and manufacturing contract with Shire plc (SHPG  -  Free Report) for Adynovate. It receives royalties and sales milestones related to both the drugs. These licensing agreements are expected to provide regular funds to the company.Also, Nektar has made a significant progress with lead candidate, Onzeald (formerly known as NKTR-102), currently under accelerated assessment in the EU for treating adults with advanced breast cancer as well as brain metastases. A response is anticipated soon.Nektar has also initiated a randomized phase III confirmatory study (ATTAIN) on Onzeald compared with the single-agent chemotherapy of physician’s choice. The trial is being conducted on patients with advanced breast cancer, who shortly complain of brain metastases. Positive results from this evaluation could support a regulatory filing in the United States.The company is further developing several other candidates across important therapeutic areas including oncology, pain, anti-infectives and immunology. Interesting ones include NKTR-181 (phase III – chronic pain), NKTR-214 (phase I/II – solid tumor) and NKTR-358 (phase I-autoimmune disease).We remind investors that in July, Nektar announced positive top-line results from an oral human abuse potential (HAP) study on NKTR-181 in order to assess the abuse potential compared with oxycodone. Notably, the FDA granted a Fast Track designation to the NKTR-181 development program.Successful development and commercialization of these candidates will in turn drive the company’s top line, considering the lucrative markets they target.Importantly, Nektar entered into a co-development deal with Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) for NKTR-358 earlier in July. Pursuant to this agreement, Nektar will be responsible for completing the ongoing phase I study on the candidate. However, going forward with the phase II study on the same, Lilly will be capturing 75% of the total costs which should lower Nektar’s  development expenses on NKTR-358.However, Nektar’s proprietary market products as well as its underdeveloped candidates are subject to stiff competition from various other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies.The company is expected to face intense rivalry in the pain market with several manufacturers developing pain therapies. Competitors include Collegium Pharmaceutical’s Xtampza and Teva Pharmaceutical’s naproxen to name a few. Also, players in PEGylation and polymer conjugate chemistry technology space are Biogen (BIIB), Savient Pharmaceuticals, Dr. Reddy’s and Novo Nordisk among others.Nektar’s heavy reliance on partners for revenues still remains a huge concern, since partnership-related setbacks may seriously weigh on the company.4 Stocks to Watch after the Massive Equifax Hack Cybersecurity stocks spiked on recent news of a data breach affecting 143 million Americans.

1183,LLY,"We expect Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 25, before the market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2.08%.So far this year, Lilly’s share price has risen 13.8% compared with an increase of 11.9% for the Zacks classified Large-Cap Pharma industry.Lilly’s earnings performance has been mixed with earnings missing expectations in two of the last four quarters, while beating in the other two, bringing the average negative surprise to 2.28%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this quarter.Factors at PlayContinuing the trend of the past few quarters, new products like Trulicity, Cyramza, Taltz and Jardiance are likely to support the top line in the second quarter. While Trulicity sales are being driven by growth in the GLP-1 market and market share gains, Jardiance sales should continue to be driven by increased market share within the growing SGLT2 class.In Dec 2016, the FDA approved Jardiance for the CV indication (launched in Jan 2017) while the American Diabetes Association (ADA) updated its diabetes treatment guidelines. At the first quarter call, management had said that since the launch of the CV indication and ADA’s addition of Jardiance to its treatment guidelines, Jardiance new-to-therapy volume has increased by 75%. This is expected to translate into higher sales.However, sales of Alimta, Cymbalta and Zyprexa are expected to continue to decline due to the loss of exclusivity. Cymbalta has lost exclusivity in Europe and Canada, Zyprexa in Japan and Alimta in several countries outside U.S. Also, lower demand in the U.S. due to competitive pressure mainly from immuno-oncology agents is hurting Alimta’s U.S. sales.Nevertheless, older products like Humalog, Trajenta and Forteo should continue to do well.Newly launched drugs like Basaglar and Lartruvo should add to the top line. Basaglar - Lilly and partner Boehringer Ingelheim’s follow-on insulin to Sanofi’s (SNY  -  Free Report) blockbuster drug, Lantus - was launched in the U.S. in mid-Dec 2016. Lartruvo (olaratumab) was launched in the U.S. and the EU for soft tissue sarcoma in the fourth quarter of 2016. Both the new drugs are expected to generate decent revenues in the to-be-reported quarter.Another new drug, Olumiant has been launched in select European countries and should add to the top line in the second quarter. The drug is under review in the U.S.  In Apr 2017, Lilly received a complete response letter (CRL) from the FDA for baricitinib. The FDA requires additional clinical data, which will delay the approval of the drug. An update on the same is expected on the conference call.Animal Health segment sales suffered last quarter due to global competitive pressure. It remains to be seen if trends improve this quarter.What Our Model IndicatesOur proven model shows that Lilly is likely to beat on earnings because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate ($1.04 per share) and the Zacks Consensus Estimate ($1.03 per share), is +0.97%.

1184,LLY,"Shares of Radius Health ((RDUS  -  Free Report)) dropped more than 7.8% in early morning trading hours Monday after the company announced that Jesper Høiland, a former top-ranking executive at Novo Nordisk ((NVO  -  Free Report)), has been appointed its new president and chief executive officer.  Høiland joins Radius at an integral moment for the company, which recently received approval for its once-daily, injectable osteoporosis treatment, Tymlos.  “We are pleased to welcome Jesper to Radius Health at this important time, and believe that he is uniquely qualified to lead Radius through the successful launch of TYMLOS™, and the advancement of our exciting clinical stage assets including elacestrant,” said Radius Chairman Kurt Graves. Høiland replaces Bob Ward, who served as Radius’ CEO since 2013 and helped lead the company through its IPO in 2014. Not long after its market debut, shares of Radius reached a peak of more than $80 during the summer of 2015, but the stock has struggled to maintain momentum since then. “I am delighted to be joining Radius in the exciting, early stages of the commercialization of TYMLOS™,” said Jesper Høiland, “and I look forward to guiding the continued development of its strong pipeline.” The new appointment comes in the wake of Radius Health rival Amgen’s ((AMGN  -  Free Report)) announcement that its own osteoporosis drug did not receive FDA approval. For now, the list of approved treatments for building bone strength to fight this degenerative condition remains at just two, with Eli Lilly’s ((LLY  -  Free Report)) Forteo remaining the market leader. For Radius investors, today’s appointment will likely lead to some short-term volatility, but a fresh face at the top of the company’s management could be the much-needed ignition source for this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock. Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.  And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - Q1 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over.

1185,LLY,"It was a busy week for the FDA’s Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (ODAC) which reviewed several experimental treatments this week including Novartis’ (NVS  -  Free Report) CAR-T cell drug. Meanwhile, French pharma giant Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report) announced it will be acquiring a vaccines company.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesFDA Panel Supports Novartis Car-T Drug: Novartis got a huge boost with an FDA advisory panel voting unanimously in favor of the company’s experimental CAR-T cell therapy CTL019. Novartis is looking to get the treatment approved for pediatric, young adult relapsed or refractory (r/r) B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The positive vote is a major milestone for the company which could become the first to launch a CAR-T cell therapy if the FDA follows the advisory panel’s advice. CTL019 is currently under priority review in the U.S. -- with the advisory panel issuing a positive recommendation, we believe chances of gaining approval are high (Read more: Novartis CAR-T Therapy Drug Recommended by FDA Panel).So far in 2017, Novartis has outperformed the Zacks categorized Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry with shares gaining 13.3% while the industry is up 11.3%.FDA Nod for J&J Psoriasis Treatment: J&J’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) Tremfya gained FDA approval for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. This makes the drug the first and only biologic approved that selectively blocks only IL-23, a cytokine that plays a key role in plaque psoriasis. Although the psoriasis market is pretty crowded, Tremfya demonstrated superior results in skin clearance compared with Humira in head-to-head analyses at weeks 16, 24 and 48.Tremfya is currently in a late-stage study for the treatment of active psoriatic arthritis and a phase III program evaluating its efficacy compared with Cosentyx in the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.Mar 2018 PDUFA Date for Pfizer’s Xeljanz Label Expansion: Pfizer’s (PFE  -  Free Report) sNDA for Xeljanz has been accepted for review by the FDA with a response expected in Mar 2018. Timely approval would make Xeljanz the first oral Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor to be available for people living with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC).Pfizer also got a favorable vote from the FDA’s advisory panel for its acute myeloid leukemia (AML) drug, Mylotarg, for newly-diagnosed patients. A final decision from the FDA should be out by Sep 2017. Mylotarg was initially approved in 2000 but was subsequently withdrawn from the market after a late-stage study failed to show a clinical benefit. Moreover, a higher rate of fatalities resulting from treatment-related toxicity was observed in the Mylotarg arm.Priority Review for Lilly’s Advanced Breast Cancer Drug: Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) got priority review from the FDA for its CDK 4 & 6 inhibitor abemaciclib. The company is looking to get abemaciclib approved as monotherapy and combination therapy (with fulvestrant) for patients with advanced breast cancer. Given the priority review status, Lilly should get a response from the FDA in the first quarter of 2018. Currently approved CDK 4/6 inhibitors include Pfizer’s Ibrance and Novartis’ Kisqali (Read more: Lilly's Breast Cancer Drug Gets Priority Review Status by FDA).Lilly also entered into a settlement agreement with generic players to settle patent infringement lawsuits related to the Cialis (tadalafil) unit dose patent. With the settlement agreement, the patent, which was previously set to expire on Apr 26, 2020, will now end on Sep 27, 2018. Cialis is approved for the treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED) and the frustrating urinary symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Cialis sales were $2.5 billion in 2016.Lilly said that the Adcirca (tadalafil) patent will remain protected until Nov 21, 2017, or May 21, 2018, if pediatric exclusivity is granted. Adcirca is approved for pulmonary arterial hypertension (Read more: Lilly Settles Patent Litigation on Cialis with Generic Firms).Sanofi to Buy Vaccines Company for Up To $750M: Sanofi, which failed in its efforts to acquire Medivation and Actelion, announced that it will be acquiring Protein Sciences, a U.S.-based privately held vaccines biotech company, for up to $750 million. This includes an upfront payment of $650 million and up to $100 million on the achievement of certain milestones.  With this acquisition, Sanofi is looking to expand its flu portfolio with the addition of a non-egg based vaccine. Protein Sciences’ Flublok Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine (QIV), which was approved by the FDA in Oct 2016, is the only recombinant protein-based flu vaccine approved by the agency. The acquisition is scheduled to close in the third quarter of 2017.  Sanofi is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock -- you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Mylan’s Herceptin Biosimilar Gets Favorable Panel Vote: Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report) got a boost with its biosimilar version of Herceptin (trastuzumab) getting a favorable recommendation from an FDA advisory panel. The panel voted 16-0 in support of eligible indications of the reference product which include HER2+ breast cancer in the metastatic and adjuvant settings. The biosimilar version has been developed under a collaboration with Biocon.PerformanceLarge Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % Return Large Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % ReturnThe NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index gained 0.4% over the last five trading sessions.

1186,LLY,"On Tuesday, shares of biopharmaceutical company Axovant Sciences Ltd. (AXON  -  Free Report) have crashed, and the stock is currently down over 70% to $6.72 per share in late-morning trading after it said that its experimental Alzheimer’s drug failed a key late-stage trial.The drug, called intepirdine, was being tested in patients that suffered from mild to moderate Alzheimer’s and who did not respond to initial treatments. The late-stage trial was highly-anticipated, but intepirdine failed to improve cognitive abilities and daily activities; it was also compared to a placebo.""While we are deeply disappointed by these trial results, we also are saddened for the millions of patients and families impacted by Alzheimer's disease,"" Axovant CEO David Hung said. ""However, we believe that the fight against Alzheimer's and other important areas of unmet need in neurology is too important to be derailed by this setback.""Alzheimer’s is a type of dementia that causes problems with memory, thinking, and behavior; symptoms develop slowly and worsen over time, becoming severe enough that they interfere with daily life. Alzheimer’s affects more than 5 million Americans, and is the sixth leading cause of death in the U.S.While there is no current cure of Alzheimer’s, there are treatments available for symptoms. But only four drugs have been approved to treat symptoms, with the most recent drug approval in 2003.Axovant’s setback follows that of other companies. Eli Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report), Merck (MRK  -  Free Report), and Denmark’s Lundbeck all suffered through failed Alzheimer’s drug trials. Similar to Lundbeck’s drug idalopirdine, intepirdine is a so-called 5-HT6 antagonist, which works to block the 5-HT6 receptor to release acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that is needed for normal cognition.Axovant, though, isn’t giving up completely. The company is now testing intepirdine in patients that suffer from a condition known as Lewy body dementia, a neurodegenerative disease with symptoms similar to those of Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s. This trial’s results are expected at the end of the year. The company will also test the drug in patients whose dementia is affecting their balance and gait.Shares of Axovant are up over 97% year-to-date, and the stock experienced a nice rally back in April when Dr. Hung came on as chief executive. The company has three other drugs in development, and currently sits at a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank.Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio?Earlier this month, credit bureau Equifax announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of every 3 Americans.

1187,LLY,"On Aug 11, 2017, we issued an updated report on Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR  -  Free Report), a biopharmaceutical company, focused on development of treatments by utilizing PEGylation and advanced polymer conjugate technology platforms.Nektar’s shares have significantly outperformed the industry so far this year, having surged 48.9%, while the industry registered a decrease of 3.4%.The company’s portfolio comprises two drugs – Movantik for opioid-induced constipation (OIC) and Adynovate for treating hemophilia A.Nektar has a global license agreement with AstraZeneca (AZN  -  Free Report) under which, the latter was granted with a worldwide, exclusive, license to develop, market and sell rights for Movantik as well as fixed-dose combination products.The company also has a licensing, collaboration and manufacturing contract with Shire plc (SHPG  -  Free Report) for Adynovate. It receives royalties and sales milestones related to both the drugs.Also, Nektar has made a significant progress with its lead candidate, Onzeald (formerly known as NKTR-102), currently under accelerated assessment in the EU for treating adults with advanced breast cancer as well as brain metastases. A response is anticipated soon.Nektar has also initiated a randomized phase III confirmatory study (ATTAIN) on Onzeald, compared with the single-agent chemotherapy of physician’s choice. The trial is being conducted on patients with advanced breast cancer, who shortly complain of brain metastases. Positive results from this study could support a regulatory filing in the U.S.The company is further developing several other candidates across important therapeutic areas including oncology, pain, anti-infectives and immunology. Interesting ones include NKTR-181 (phase III – chronic pain), NKTR-214 (phase I/II – solid tumor) and NKTR-358 (phase I-autoimmune disease).We remind investors that in July, Nektar announced positive top-line results from an oral human abuse potential (HAP) study on NKTR-181 in order to assess the abuse potential compared with oxycodone. Notably, the FDA granted a Fast Track designation to the NKTR-181 development program.Successful development and commercialization of these candidates will in turn boost the company’s top line, considering the lucrative markets they are targeting.Importantly, Nektar entered into a co-development deal with Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) for NKTR-358 this month. Pursuant to this agreement, Nektar will be responsible for completing the ongoing phase I study on the candidate. However, going forward with the phase II study on the same, Lilly will be capturing 75% of the total costs to possibly lower the company’s development expenses on NKTR-358.However, Nektar’s proprietary market products as well as the candidates under development are subject to stiff competition from various pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies.The company is expected to face intense rivalry in the pain market with several manufacturers developing pain therapies. Competitors include Collegium Pharmaceutical’s Xtampza and Teva Pharmaceutical’s naproxen to name a few. Also, players in PEGylation and polymer conjugate chemistry technology space are Biogen (BIIB), Savient Pharmaceuticals, Dr. Reddy’s and Novo Nordisk among others.Nektar’s heavy reliance on partners for revenues remains a concern, since partnership-related setbacks may seriously weigh on the company.Nektar Therapeutics Price and ConsensusNektar Therapeutics Price and Consensus | Nektar Therapeutics QuoteZacks RankNektar currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1188,LLY,"Nektar Therapeutics’ (NKTR  -  Free Report) shares have declined almost 9% since Aug 8 after the company reported second-quarter results. The biotech reported a wider-than-expected loss while sales missed estimates.Nektar’s second-quarter 2017 loss of 39 cents per share was wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 35 cents. This reported loss was also wider than the year-ago loss of 36 cents per share.Nektar’s shares have significantly outperformed the industry so far this year. The company’s shares have surged 46.3% while the industry has registered a decrease of 4.1%.Quarterly revenues rose 5.5% to $34.6 million from the year-ago quarter. This increase in revenues can mainly be attributed to the rise in product sales and royalty revenues. However, the top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $36 million.Quarter in DetailThe top line comprised product sales, royalty revenues, non-cash royalty revenues, license, collaboration and other revenues.In the second quarter, product sales increased 21.7% to $15.7 million from $12.9 million a year ago. However, non-cash royalty revenues decreased 18.5% to $6.6 million.The company reported royalty revenues of $7.4 million, registering a huge improvement of 111.4% in the second quarter compared with $3.5 million in the year-ago quarter. This was mainly thanks to royalty revenues from Movantik sales.License, collaboration and other revenues came in at $4.8 million, down 42.2% compared with $8.3 million a year ago. This fall in revenues can mainly be attributed to the recognition of $3.2 million, received from Daiichi Sankyo for the sublicense of Onzeald (formerly known as NKTR-102) in Europe in second-quarter 2016.Research and development (R&D) expenses climbed 15.1% to $60.3 million, primarily due to investments in pipeline, including key candidates, NKTR-358 and NKTR-181.General and administrative (G&A) expenses were up 45.5% to $16 million. This massive jump can mainly be attributed to a payment of $7 million for settlement of a litigation regarding a cross-license agreement with Enzon, Inc., a Florida-based pharma company.Pipeline UpdateThe most advanced candidate in the company’s portfolio is Onzeald, currently under accelerated assessment in the EU for treatment of adults with advanced breast cancer, having brain metastases. However, the company was informed last month by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) that it had adopted a negative opinion for the conditional marketing application for the candidate in the EU. Subsequently, in the same month, the company filed a request for examining the opinion adopted by the CHMP.Apart from Onzeald, another candidate in the company’s immuno-oncology portfolio is NKTR-214. A phase I/II study evaluating NKTR-214 as a potential combination treatment regimen with Bristol-Myers Squibb’s (BMY  -  Free Report) Opdivo is underway. During the second quarter, Nektar announced that it has started dosing patients in the trial and plans to enroll up to 260 patients in eight target cancer indications. The company expects to report initial data from the dose-escalation part of the study soon.Notably, in May, Nektar announced a research collaboration agreement with Japanese pharma company, Takeda Pharmaceuticals, to explore the combination of NKTR-214 with five oncology compounds from Takeda’s cancer portfolio.Last month, Nektar announced that it has entered into a strategic collaboration contract with Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) to co-develop NKTR-358 (phase I study ongoing) for treatment of a number of autoimmune and other chronic inflammatory conditions.2017 Outlook UpdatedNektar raised its revenue outlook for 2017 to account for a $150 million upfront payment it expects to receive from Lilly. The company now estimates revenue in the range of $215-$225 million compared with $145-$155 million, projected previously.Driven by the same reason, Nektar also raised its expected cash position for the year ending 2017 with approximately $350 million compared with $225 million, estimated previously.Nektar Therapeutics Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseNektar Therapeutics Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Nektar Therapeutics QuoteZacks Rank & Key PicksNektar currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A better-ranked stock in the health care sector is Enzo Biochem, Inc. , carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Enzo Biochem’s loss per share estimates narrowed from 12 cents to 7 cents for 2017 and from 11 cents to 3 cents for 2018 over the last 60 days.

1189,LLY,"Celldex Therapeutics, Inc. (CLDX  -  Free Report) incurred second-quarter 2017 loss of 23 cents per share, which was narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 25 cents as well as the year-ago loss of 32 cents per share. Lower costs and higher revenues led to the narrower loss in the quarter.Total revenue in the quarter rose 171.4% year over year to $3.8 million, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.82 million. The manufacturing service agreement with the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative led to higher revenues in the quarter.Shares of the biotech company rose 4.3% in after-hours trading on Tuesday.However, the stock has not done too well this year so far. It has declined 27.7% year to date against the 9.7% increase registered by the industry.Research and development expenses declined 2.7% from the year-ago period to $25.0 million. General and administrative spend declined 16.7% to $6.5 million.As of Jun 30, 2017, Celldex had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $154.0 million compared with $167.0 million as of Mar 31, 2017. Celldex expects that this cash plus anticipated proceeds from the future sales of its common stock under the agreement with Cantor will be enough to fund working capital requirements and planned operations through 2018. However, the guidance assumes that Celldex will pay future Kolltan contingent milestones, if any, in stock and not in cash.Pipeline UpdateCelldex’s most advanced pipeline candidate is glembatumumab vedotin, currently being evaluated for the treatment of triple negative breast cancer (phase IIb - METRIC study) and metastatic melanoma (phase II). Enrolment in the METRIC study is expected to be completed in September this year, with top-line data expected in the second quarter of 2018.Data from the phase II metastatic melanoma study of glemba, as a single agent, was presented in June at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO). Glemba performed well in the single agent setting with 11% response rate, a 52% disease control rate and a median duration of response of six months in patients who have failed three or four prior lines of therapy. The study also includes two new cohorts, a glembatumumab plus varlilumab arm - data expected by year end - and a glembatumumab plus checkpoint inhibitor arm, including either Bristol-Myers Squibb Company’s (BMY  -  Free Report) Opdivo or Merck & Co, Inc.’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda.Apart from glembatumumab vedotin, Celldex has several promising candidates in its pipeline, including varlilumab and CDX-014 (phase I—advanced renal cell carcinoma) among others.Varlilumab is being evaluated in combination with Bristol-Myers Opdivo in a phase II study that includes cohorts in five indications - colorectal cancer, ovarian cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma and glioblastoma. Celldex plans to complete enrolment across all cohorts in the phase II portion of the study in the first quarter of 2018. Meanwhile, the company presented data from the phase 1 potion of varlilumab/Opdivo combination study at ASCO in June. The data showed that the combination was well tolerated at all tested dose levels without any increased autoimmunity or inappropriate immune activation.With the Kolltan acquisition in Nov 2016, Celldex gained rights to two of Kolltan’s cancer pipeline candidates, CDX-0158 and CDX-3379. While CDX-0158 is being evaluated in a phase I study for refractory gastrointestinal stromal tumors/GIST and other KIT positive tumors (data expected by year end), a phase II study on CDX-3379 in patients with recurrent/metastatic head and neck squamous cell cancer who are refractory to Eli Lilly & Company (LLY  -  Free Report)/Bristol-Myers’ Erbitux is expected to be initiated in the fourth quarterCelldex Therapeutics, Inc.

1190,LLY,"World Heart Day is observed every year on September 29 to raise awareness across the world about cardiovascular (CV) diseases. CV diseases, more commonly known as heart disease or stroke, are basically diseases of the heart or blood vessels.According to the World Heart Federation, CV diseases are the biggest killers in the world accounting for 17.5 million deaths every year with the number expected to cross 23 million by 2030. Some of the factors contributing to these numbers include uncontrolled hypertension, high cholesterol levels, obesity, smoking, diabetes and a sedentary lifestyle.The theme this World Heart Day is “Share the Power” with the focus on inspiring people across the world to be heart healthy. The focus is on creating heart-healthy environments that will help reduce cardiovascular risk be it at work or at home. Simple changes in lifestyle including healthy eating, exercising, lower alcohol consumption and giving up smoking are some of the ways to cut or even prevent the risk of CV diseases.According to the FDA, 2,200 people die from cardiovascular disease every day in the United States – this adds up to about 815,000 Americans every year. Given these statistics, it is not surprising that several healthcare companies devote a significant amount of R&D dollars on developing treatments and devices for cardiovascular and other diseases that increase the risk of heart issues. According to a GBI Research report, more than 1,400 products are in active development for CV diseases with the focus being on four main indications – hypertension, heart failure, dyslipidemia and thrombosis.Importantly, it is not just healthcare companies that are involved in the fitness segment – with many CV diseases being preventable by addressing behavioral risk factors like food consumption, smoking and lack of exercise, people are becoming more conscious about their health. This has led to tech companies coming out with fitness trackers that help keep track of heart rates, calories burned and sleep patterns all of which help in the management of lifestyle diseases like diabetes and obesity.With World Heart Day coming up, let’s take a look at some well-positioned stocks in this segment of the market.  BioTelemetry, Inc. (BEAT  -  Free Report): Malvern, PA-based BioTelemetry is a wireless medical technology company which provides health information with the aim of improving the quality of life and reduce the cost of care. The company provides cardiac monitoring services, original equipment manufacturing with a primary focus on cardiac monitoring devices and centralized core laboratory services.The Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has a strong earnings track record having surpassed expectations in each of the last four quarters. The recent acquisition of LifeWatch has positioned the company as the largest provider of remote healthcare services in the world. BioTelemetry looks well-positioned in the rapidly evolving connected health market and expects to serve more than a million patients in 2018.Shares of BioTelemetry have gained 39.8% year to date, significantly outperforming the industry’s 4% rally.Edwards Lifesciences Corp. (EW  -  Free Report): Edwards Lifesciences holds a leading position in patient-focused innovations for structural heart disease and critical care monitoring. The company’s portfolio includes products like annuloplasty rings, catheters and heart valves that enable the treatment of patients with cardiovascular disease. Edwards Lifesciences is focused on developing transformational structural heart therapies and estimates that the global transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) opportunity could cross $5 billion by 2021 driven by increasing awareness, expanding indications and improving technology. Shares of this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock, which holds a strong position in the approximately $1.8 billion global surgical heart valve segment, are up 17.9% year to date compared to the industry’s rally of 17.8%. The company has consistently surpassed earnings expectations in each of the last four quarters.Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report): Although Swiss drugmaker, Novartis, has been in the news lately for gaining approval for the first CAR-T cell treatment in the United States, the company is also a key player in the heart failure segment – the Zacks Rank #2 stock has an approved drug in the form of Entresto for the treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Heart failure, a debilitating and life-threatening condition, is estimated to affect more than 60 million people across the world. About 50% of heart failure patients suffer from reduced ejection fraction. Novartis is working on generating more data on Entresto and heart failure through more than 40 active or planned studies. Novartis also has a good earnings track record with earnings surpassing expectations in each of the last four quarters.Shares of this Zacks Rank #2 stock are up 18.4% year to date compared to the industry’s rally of 16.7%.In addition to the above three stocks, there are several other companies involved in this therapeutic area including companies like Merck (MRK  -  Free Report), Novo Nordisk (NVO  -  Free Report) and Eli Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) among others.

1191,LLY,"Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has denied approval to its investigational rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment, sirukumab, an IL-6 inhibitor, for want of additional safety data.The FDA issued a complete response letter (CRL) for J&J’s Biologics License Application (BLA) for sirukumab which was filed in September last year.The company is looking to get sirukumab approved for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active RA who have had an inadequate response or are intolerant to one or more disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs).Regulatory applications are under review in EU and Japan as well. The proposed trade name for sirukumab is Plivensia.So far this year, J&J’s share price has increased 13.8%, comparing unfavorably with a gain of 17% recorded by the industry it belongs to.The CRL was somewhat expected as last month, FDA’s Arthritis Advisory Committee had not recommended approval of sirukumab, raising some safety concerns. The panel was concerned with the increased mortality rates for both the evaluated doses of (50 mg and 100 mg) of sirukumab.The FDA in its CRL has asked for additional clinical data to further evaluate the safety of the candidate. J&J plans to meet with the FDA for a follow-up discussion. The CRL is expected to delay the drug’s approval, which was previously expected to happen this year.In July this year, J&J’s partner for sirukumab, U.K. based drug giant GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK  -  Free Report), informed the termination of its collaboration with J&J.We remind investors that Eli Lilly & Company (LLY  -  Free Report) and partner Incyte Corporation (INCY  -  Free Report) had also received a CRL for their experimental JAK inhibitor, baricitinib to treat RA as the FDA demanded additional data.However, in August, the companies informed that they will re-submit the NDA for baricitinib much faster than previously expected as they will not be required to conduct an additional study. The NDA is expected to be re-submitted in January next year.RA is a common, chronic, life-long, autoimmune disease that affects about 1.3 million people in the United States.J&J carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1192,LLY,"Key highlights in the pharma sector include a complete response letter (“CRL”) from the FDA for Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) investigational rheumatoid arthritis (“RA”) treatment and FDA approval for Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) and Bristol-Myers Squibb’s (BMY  -  Free Report) cancer drugs.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesCRL for J&J RA Drug: J&J’s Janssen Biotech got a CRL from the FDA for sirukumab for the treatment of moderately to severely active RA. The agency has asked for additional data on the safety of sirukumab. This does not come as a surprise considering the investigational treatment failed to get the support of an FDA advisory panel last month. Given the safety concerns raised by the panel, the request for additional data was more or less expected. J&J intends to meet with the agency to determine the requirements for gaining approval for the IL-6 inhibitor.Meanwhile, the company has submitted a new drug application (“NDA”) for the first darunavir-based single tablet regimen for the treatment of HIV. Approval would make this combination the only complete regimen with the potential to deliver the advantages of a single table regimen with the high genetic barrier to resistance of darunavir and the demonstrated safety profile of TAF.Another FDA Nod for Merck’s Keytruda: Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy, Keytruda, has gained FDA approval for yet another indication. The cancer therapy, which is already available for a wide range of indications, can now be used in previously-treated patients with recurrent locally advanced or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma whose tumors express PD-L1. This marks the tenth new indication for Keytruda over a three-year period.Keytruda is a key product in Merck’s portfolio with the drug bringing in sales of $1.5 billion in the first half of 2017. The company is working on expanding the label of the drug which is currently in more than 550 studies covering a wide range of cancers and treatment settings (Read more: Merck's Keytruda Gets FDA Nod for Advanced Gastric Cancer).Merck is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Allergan Announces Share Buy Back, CFO Departure: Allergan (AGN  -  Free Report) continues to work on returning capital to its shareholders with the company announcing its intention to buy back shares worth $2 billion. This comes shortly after the company completed a $15 billion share buyback program. Allergan also reaffirmed its commitment to increase its cash dividend every year while reiterating its commitment to maintaining investment grade credit ratings and paying down $3.75 billion of debt in 2018.The company also announced the departure of Tessa Hilado, executive vice president and chief financial officer (""CFO""), who will be retiring from the company once a successor is appointed.Bristol-Myers’ Opdivo Gets Another Approval: Bristol-Myers also gained approval for another indication for its immune-oncology therapy, Opdivo. With the latest approval, Opdivo can now be used for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma patients previously treated with Nexavar (sorafenib). This makes Opdivo the first and only immuno-oncology agent to be approved for this patient population (Read more: Bristol-Myers Opdivo Gets Approval for Liver Cancer).The company also gained approval in Japan for the use of Opdivo for the treatment of unresectable advanced or recurrent gastric cancer which has progressed after chemotherapy. Gastric cancer is highly prevalent in Asian countries and is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in Japan.Bristol-Myers also entered into a clinical trial collaboration with AbbVie under which a combination of Opdivo and AbbVie’s investigational antibody drug conjugate ABBV-399 will be evaluated in c-met overexpressing non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Bristol-Myers stock has gained 8.1% year to date, compared to the 17.1% rally of the industry it belongs to.Priority Review for Aradigm Drug: Aradigm got priority review for Linhaliq for the treatment of non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis (NCFBE) patients with chronic infections with pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa). A response from the agency regarding the approval status of the drug should be out by Jan 26, 2018. NCFBE, a severe, chronic and rare disease, affects more than 150,000 people in the United States and over 200,000 people in Europe. With no drug currently approved for the treatment of this condition, there is significant unmet need. Aradigm’s shares were up 32.8% on the news.PerformanceLarge Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % ReturnLarge Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % ReturnThe NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index is down 0.1% so far this week.

1193,LLY,"On Jul 12, 2017, we issued an updated report on ImmunoGen, Inc. (IMGN  -  Free Report).ImmunoGen is a development-stage biotechnology company focused on developing targeted cancer therapeutics, using its proprietary antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) technology.The company’s shares have significantly outperformed the Zacks categorised Medical-Drugs industry so far this year, having soared 239.2%, while the industry has registered an increase of 6.3%.ImmunoGen has made a significant progress with regard to the lead pipeline candidate, mirvetuximab soravtansine, which is currently in a phase III study (FORWARD I) as a single-agent therapy. It has been put on trial for treating patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer whose tumors express high or medium levels of FR alpha and who have received up to three prior treatment regimens.Combination regimens with mirvetuximab soravtansine in ovarian cancer are in the phase Ib/II FORWARD II study, aiming to expand the eligible patient population. Following successful completion of dose escalation, a phase II expansion cohort in combination with Roche’s Avastin is also ongoing. ImmunoGen expects to report initial data from the FORWARD II study soon.Notably, mirvetuximab soravtansine enjoys Orphan Drug status in both the U.S. and the EU for treatment of ovarian cancer.Although the platinum-resistant ovarian cancer market provides an immense commercial potential, ImmunoGen is set to face intense competition, upon approval. Nonetheless, mirvetuximab soravtansine looks promising at this juncture and its sanction will be a huge boost to the company.Apart from mirvetuximab soravtansine, ImmunoGen is working on developing a couple of other candidates, including IMGN779 and IMGN632. IMGN779 is being evaluated in a phase I study for treating acute myeloid leukemia with data expected later this year. The company plans to file an investigational new drug application (INDA) for IMGN632 to treat hematological malignancies in the third quarter of 2017.ImmunoGen has agreements with several big healthcare companies including Amgen Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report), Bayer, Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report), Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report), Roche, Sanofi and Takeda. These agreements in turn allow other companies to use ImmunoGen’s ADC technology and provide it with funds in the form of license and milestone fees, royalties, clinical materials revenue and R&D support fees.ImmunoGen, Inc.

1194,LLY,"Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has approved its anti-PD-1 therapy, Keytruda as a monotherapy for third-line treatment of advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma.Keytruda is already approved for many types of cancers and treatment settings including lung cancer, melanoma, head and neck cancer, classical hodgkin lymphoma and bladder cancer.The drug’s label has now been expanded to include treatment of heavily pre-treated patients with recurrent locally advanced or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer whose tumors express PD-L1, as determined by an FDA approved test. However, the approval for this tenth new indication for Keytruda comes on an accelerated basis with continued approval dependent on further benefit demonstrated from clinical studies.The FDA approval was based on data from the KEYNOTE-059 study.Keytruda is key top line driver for Merck and it brought in sales of $881 million in second-quarter 2017, up 51% sequentially and 180% year over year.Sales continue to be driven by launch of new indications globally. Keytruda sales in the U.S. gained particularly from strong momentum in the new indication of first-line lung cancer. Outside U.S, Keytruda sales were primarily driven by the melanoma indication.Meanwhile, the Keytruda development program also significantly advanced this year with regulatory approvals for four new indications in the U.S. and two additional indications in Europe. Important approvals include that for advanced bladder cancer in both United States and the EU, advanced microsatellite instability-high cancers and first approval as a combination therapy with Eli Lilly & Company’s (LLY  -  Free Report) cancer drug Alimta (pemetrexed) and carboplatin (pem/carbo),), a commonly used chemo regimen, in lung cancer. Further Keytruda data readouts are pending this year.Keytruda is continuously growing and expanding into new indications and markets globally. Keytruda is being studied for more than 30 types of cancer in more than 550 studies, including more than 300 combination studies.Merck is collaborating with several companies including Amgen, Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report), Incyte, Glaxo and Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) separately for the evaluation of Keytruda in combination with other regimens.Merck carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1195,LLY,"Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) and partner Incyte Corporation (INCY  -  Free Report) announced that its pipeline candidate, baricitinib, met the primary endpoint in a phase II study in patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD), a type of eczema.So far this year, Lilly’s shares have underperformed the industry. While, the stock has been up 12.9%, the industry gained 17%.Notably, the results showed that after 16 weeks of treatment, 61% of patients treated with baricitinib (4 mg) in plus topical corticosteroid (TCS) achieved a 50% or greater improvement in the signs and symptoms of AD versus 37% in patients treated with TCS alone. Thereby, suggesting that baricitinib may have the potential to become an oral treatment option for patients suffering from atopic dermatitis who are unable to achieve adequate control with topical steroids.  However, in patients treated with the 2 mg dose group of baricitinib in combination with TCS, the primary endpoint was not statistically different compared to treatment with TCS alone. At four weeks of treatment, 68% of patients treated with baricitinib (4-mg) plus TCS combination and 62% of patients treated with baricitinib (2-mg )plus TCS combination witnessed an improvement in the signs and symptoms of AD compared to 16% of patients in TCS alone.Therefore, based on the phase II results, Lilly and Incyte plan to initiate a phase III study for atopic dermatitis later this year.Baricitinib, a once-daily oral medication, is already marketed in the EU by the trade name of Olumiant for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA).We remind the investors that in the United States the FDA had issued a complete response letter (CRL) for baricitinib’s new drug application (NDA) for rheumatoid arthritis in April. In fact, the FDA had asked for additional clinical data to determine the most appropriate doses as well as to further characterize safety concerns across treatment arms.In July, Lilly had declared that the NDA resubmission for baricitinib will not occur in 2017 and will be delayed by a minimum of 18 months.But, in August, Lilly and Incyte announced that they will re-submit the NDA for baricitinib much faster than previously expected. To this end, the NDA is expected to be re-submitted in January, 2018.Consequently, the company expects the revised submission, which will include new safety and efficacy data, to be classified by the FDA as a Class II resubmission. A decision from the FDA is therefore expected in six months. Importantly, a new clinical study will not be required.Markedly, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (REGN  -  Free Report) and partner Sanofi’s  (SNY  -  Free Report) Dupixent Injection was recently launched in the United States for the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe AD in March, 2017..  Currently, the drug is under review in the EU for the same indication.Eli Lilly and Company Price  Eli Lilly and Company Price | Eli Lilly and Company QuoteZacks RankLilly carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1196,LLY,"Several important developments were reported this week with key highlights including the termination of a hepatitis C virus deal, the approval of the first cancer biosimilar in the United States and the presentation of data by companies like Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY  -  Free Report) among others.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesAchillion Down on HCV Deal Termination: Achillion Pharmaceuticals’s (ACHN  -  Free Report) shares fell on the termination of the company’s partnership agreement with Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen Pharmaceuticals for hepatitis C virus (""HCV""). Janssen said that it will not continue with the development of JNJ-4178, a combination of three direct acting antivirals: AL-335, odalasvir and simeprevir. The decision to discontinue development does not come as a big surprise given the intense competition and pricing dynamics in the HCV market. Achillion intends to focus on the development of advanced multiple small molecule factor D inhibitors of the complement alternative pathway (Read more: Achillion's HCV Partnership with J&J Terminated, Stock Falls).First Cancer Biosimilar Gets FDA Nod: The FDA approved Allergan (AGN  -  Free Report) and Amgen’s Mvasi, a biosimilar version of Roche’s blockbuster cancer drug, Avastin (bevacizumab). Mvasi can be used for all eligible indications of the reference product. Approval was in line with expectations considering the favorable vote the biosimilar got from an FDA advisory panel recently. The approval is quite a boost for the companies as well as the effort to lower drug prices though so far biosimilars are yet to make a significant dent in referenced product sales in the United States. Mvasi is under review in the EU.Pfizer’s Xtandi PROSPERs in Late-Stage Study: Pfizer and partner Astellas Pharma could well be on the path to boost sales of their prostate cancer drug, Xtandi, with the companies announcing positive top-line data from a late-stage study (PROSPER) in patients with non-metastatic (M0) castration-resistant prostate cancer (""CRPC""). The companies plan to discuss this data with regulatory authorities for the expansion of the drug’s label. Xtandi sales, which have been under pressure, should receive a boost on approval for this patient population.Bristol-Myers Signs Deal, Presents Cancer Data: Bristol-Myers Squibb presented data at the European Society for Medical Oncology (""ESMO"") 2017 Congress showing that treatment with Opdivo led to superior recurrence-free survival (35%) compared to Yervoy in patients with resected high-risk melanoma (Read more: Bristol-Myers Reports Positive Results from Melanoma Study).Meanwhile, the company has signed a deal with Halozyme for the latter’s ENHANZE technology. The global collaboration and license agreement is focused on the use of Halozyme’s technology for the subcutaneous administration of Bristol-Myers’s immuno-oncology drugs thereby providing patients with more flexible and convenient treatment delivery options.Bristol-Myers will shell out $105 million upfront plus make future milestone and royalty payments. The dilutive transaction is expected to hit Bristol-Myers’s 2017 and 2018 earnings by a penny and 2019 earnings by five cents.Lilly’s Baricitinib Fares Well in Mid-Stage Eczema Study: Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) and Incyte presented new safety and efficacy data from a mid-stage study on baricitinib for eczema at the annual meeting of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (""EADV""). Baricitinib, when combined with a mid-potency topical corticosteroid (""TCS""), significantly improved the signs and symptoms of eczema compared to TCS alone. The companies intend to commence a phase III program for the eczema indication later this year. Baricitinib is currently approved in the EU under the trade name Olumiant for moderate-to-severe-active rheumatoid arthritis. However, approval is yet to come in the United States where a regulatory filing will be resubmitted by Jan 2018. Lilly stock has gained 12.9% year to date, compared to the 16% rally of the industry it belongs to.Teva Appoints New CEO: Teva (TEVA  -  Free Report) has finally ended its search for a Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) with the company announcing the appointment of Kare Schultz as the company’s President and CEO. A seasoned veteran in the healthcare industry, Schulz will bring with him almost thirty years of experience in this segment. Schulz was recently serving as the President and CEO of H. Lundbeck A/S, where he was responsible for implementing significant restructuring initiatives and launching a robust turnaround strategy. Schulz has a daunting task ahead of him considering the challenges being faced by Teva including generic pricing erosion. The company needs to work on paying down debt, divesting non-core businesses to increase focus on core areas and generate cash, delivering on the pipeline and getting the U.S. generics business back on track (Read more: Teva Hires Kare Schultz as CEO: Is a Recovery in the Cards?).Positive FDA Panel Vote for Glaxo’s Shingles Vaccine: GlaxoSmithKline (GSK  -  Free Report) got a positive vote from the FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (“VRBPAC”) for Shingrix for the prevention of herpes zoster (shingles) in adults ages 50 and over. Given the positive vote, chances of gaining approval look pretty high. We note that Merck’s Zostavax, a live attenuated virus vaccine is currently available for the prevention of shingles in the same patient population (Read more: Glaxo's Shingles Candidate Gets Positive FDA Committee Vote).Glaxo is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.

1197,LLY,"Within the Medical sector, biotech stocks have performed well in the first half of the year, despite challenges like rising competition, pipeline setbacks, slowdown in growth of mature products and generic competition for certain key drugs. The sector recovered from the pricing controversy of 2016 and defied uncertainties surrounding President Trump’s proposed healthcare policy.Some of the factors that are responsible for the biotech sector performing well in the current year so far are an increase in FDA approvals, new product sales ramp up, R&D success and innovation, strong clinical study results and continued strong performance of legacy products.A few other events also contributed to the rally in the sector in the past month. These include pharmaceutical giant, Gilead Sciences (GILD  -  Free Report) decision to acquire immunotherapy focused company, Kite Pharma .The FDA’s approval of Novartis AG’s NVS gene transfer treatment, Kymriah (tisagenlecleucel) suspension for the treatment of patients up to 25 years of age with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) that is refractory or in second or later relapse was another good news for the sector. Kymriah, formerly CTL019, is the first chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy to be approved.Further, two companies -- Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ALXN  -  Free Report) and Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) -- announced restructuring initiatives including job cuts recently. While the former will reduce its global workforce by about 20%, Lilly will do the same by about 8%. Both the companies plan to invest the cost savings in new drugs/line extensions which in turn bodes well for growth of the sector as well.Industry and Rank PerformanceThe broader Drugs market is up 11.9% year to date, outpacing the 11.8% gain for the S&P 500.Two of the four Zacks industries — Medical-Biomed and Genetics (16% versus 11.8%) and Large-Cap Pharma (16% versus 11.8%) have outperformed the S&P 500 Index.The Zacks Industry Rank for Medical-Biomed and Genetics is #105 (top 40% of the 265 Zacks industries), for Medical-Drugs the rank is #105 (top 40%), for  Large-Cap Pharma it is #79 (top 30%) Our back testing shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Which Stocks to Pick?To cash in on the favorable trends in the drug/biotech space, this is the right time to add a few stocks that have growth potential.We have taken the help of the Zacks Stock Screener  to select the right stocks.

1198,LLY,"Total earnings for 83.3% of the total healthcare market capitalization are up 6% on revenue growth of 4.1%. Though earnings growth is weak compared with many other sectors, earnings and revenue beat ratios of 85% and 70%, respectively, are particularly encouraging. In fact, healthcare is the fourth sector that surprised investors the most on earnings, trailing aerospace, technology and materials.Among the most notable players, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) was the first major drug company to report earnings on July 18, followed by Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) on July 25 and July 27, respectively. Two other major U.S. drug companies – Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) and Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) – reported on July 28 and August 1, respectively. These industry primes posted solid results with earnings beat while a few lagged on the revenue front.Johnson and Johnson Earnings in FocusThe world's biggest maker of healthcare products continued its long streak of earnings beat but narrowly missed the top–line estimate. Earnings per share came in at $1.83, 4 cents ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate and 5.2% higher than the year-ago quarter. Revenues grew 1.9% year over year to $18.84 billion but fell shy of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $18.89 billion.Johnson & Johnson raised its full-year earnings per share guidance to $7.12–$7.22 from $7.00–$7.15 and revenue guidance to $75.8–$76.1 billion from $75.4–$76.1 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was pegged at $7.10 for earnings per share and $75.71 billion for revenues at time of earnings release. JNJ has gained 0.9% to date since its earnings announcement (read: J&J Brightens Outlook: Healthcare ETFs in Focus).Pfizer Earnings in FocusThe U.S. drug giant beat on earnings but missed on revenues. Earnings per share of 67 cents came in couple of cents above the Zacks Consensus Estimate while revenues of $12.9 billion fell shy of our estimate of $13 billion. On an annual basis, earnings per share rose 5% and revenues declined 2%.For 2017, Pfizer expects revenues in the range of $52-$54 billion and raised the lower end of the earnings per share guidance to $2.54-$2.60 from $2.50–$2.60. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is correctly pegged at $52.79 billion for revenues and $2.56 for earnings per share. Shares of PFE are up 1.8% since the earnings announcement.Merck Earnings in FocusEarnings per share came in at $1.01, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 87 cents and improving 8.6% from the year-ago quarter.

1199,LLY,"Radius Health, Inc. (RDUS  -  Free Report) posted a loss of $1.58 per share in the second quarter of 2017, wider than the loss of $1.01 per share in the year-ago quarter and wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate loss of $1.35. The year-over-year increase in net loss was attributable to an increase in general and administrative expenses.Radius’ share price increased 13.3% year to date against the industry’s gain of 1%.The company reported sales of Tymlos (abaloparatide) of $1.0 million from the first four weeks of launch, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.96 million.Quarter in DetailResearch and development expenses for the reported quarter were $19.6 million, down 27% year over year due to a decrease in regulatory and professional fees associated with abaloparatide-SC regulatory applications, decrase in elacestrant (RAD1901) project costs and a decrease in development costs associated with abaloparatide-TD.General and administrative expenses for the reported quarter jumped to $50.1 million from $17.2 million. The increase was attributed to growth in professional support costs, including the costs associated with increasing headcount for the commercialization of Tymlos. Higher compensation expenses, including stock-based compensation, due to an increase in headcount were also responsible for increased costs.Radius Health, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Radius Health, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Radius Health, Inc. QuotePipeline UpdatesOn Apr 28, the FDA approved Radius Health’s lead candidate Tymlos injection for the treatment of postmenopausal women with high risk osteoporosis for fracture – defined as history of osteoporotic fracture – multiple risk factors for fracture, or patients who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapy.The company is developing two formulations of abaloparatide- abaloparatide-SC and abaloparatide-transdermal.Meanwhile, Radius Health’ Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) for Eladynos (abaloparatide-SC) for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis in Europe is under review by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency. The company however suffered a setback when the CHMP issued a second Day-180 List of Outstanding Issues. Consequently, Radius is working with the CHMP to address these issues and the company expects a response prior to the end of 2017.In May, Radius Health announced positive top-line results from the completed 24-month ACTIVExtend clinical trial on Tymlos, which met all of its primary and secondary endpoints. The company expects to submit a sNDA to the FDA in connection with the ACTIVExtend results by year end.The company reported positive data from its ongoing phase I dose-escalation and expansion study on elacestrant in advanced metastatic breast cancer. The company discussed these data from the ongoing phase I studies with the FDA to determine the next steps for elacestrant breast cancer program, including the design of a phase II trial.Following this discussion, the FDA agreed that a single-arm monotherapy phase II study of under 200 patients is appropriate. The agency also provided additional feedback on the proposed clinical protocol, including confirmation that the primary endpoint will be objective response rate, along with durability of response. The FDA also stated that if the study results demonstrate superiority to the then-available therapies, the single-arm phase II trial could be considered a pivotal study for accelerated approval as long as the company has also commenced a confirmatory study by the time of its new drug application (NDA) submission.In addition, elacestrant is also being evaluated at low doses as an estrogen receptor ligand for the potential relief of the frequency and severity of moderate to severe hot flashes in postmenopausal women with vasomotor symptoms. The company expects to report results from its phase IIb clinical study of elacestrant for the potential treatment of postmenopausal vasomotor symptoms in the second half of 2017.Our TakeThe company’s wider-than-expected loss in the second quarter was disappointing as expenses continue to increase with the launch of Tymlos. The company is moving ahead with its plans in contracting with managed care organizations with access to over 133 million covered lives across Commercial and Medicare Part D plans.Although the osteoporosis market in the U.S. has great potential as approximately 1.4 million postmenopausal women in the U.S. experience an osteoporotic fracture each year, Tymlos is expected to face significant competition from Eli Lilly &Co's (LLY  -  Free Report) Forteo and Amgen Inc's (AMGN  -  Free Report) Prolia. Moreover, the approved label carries a boxed warning of osteosarcoma (a malignant bone tumor). The company, however, suffered a setback when the CHMP issued a second Day-180 List of Outstanding Issues.Zacks Rank & Key PickRadius Health currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A better-ranked stock in the healthcare sector is Gilead Sciences. Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) which currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1200,LLY,"This week, companies like Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report), Allergan (AGN  -  Free Report) and Teva (TEVA  -  Free Report) reported second quarter results. While Pfizer reported a mixed quarter, Allergan topped expectations. Teva, however, had a tough quarter. Meanwhile, Bristol-Myers (BMY  -  Free Report) announced immune-oncology (IO) focused deals including an acquisition.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesA Look at Q2 Earnings Results: Big companies like Pfizer, Allergan and Teva reported second quarter results this week. Pfizer surpassed earnings estimates but missed on revenues raising concerns about the company’s top-line growth prospects. While Prevnar and Enbrel sales declined during the quarter, Pfizer is facing two key loss of exclusivities (LOEs) in the U.S. -- Viagra later this year and Lyrica at the end of 2018 (Read more: Pfizer Surpasses Q2 Earnings Estimates, Misses Sales).Meanwhile, Allergan topped both earnings and sales estimates and raised its outlook as well (Read more: Allergan Q2 Earnings & Sales Top, Restasis Sales Down).Teva’s shares fell 24% on a dismal quarter with the company missing on earnings and sales reflecting the performance of the U.S. generics business and the continued deterioration in Venezuela. The generics business was hit by accelerated price erosion and lower volume mainly due to customer consolidation, higher competition, and delayed new product launches. Teva lowered its outlook for the year and slashed its dividend as well. The company also expects to exit 45 markets across the globe by year end and will be cutting its headcount by about 7,000 since the closing of the Actavis Generics business deal. Teva has lost 34.5% of its value year to date versus the 7.6% decline of its industry.J&J, AbbVie Drug Gets FDA Nod for cGVHD: Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) and AbbVie’s BTK inhibitor Imbruvica gained FDA approval for its first non-cancer indication -- chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD) in adults after failure of one or more systemic lines of therapy. This makes Imbruvica the first and only approved treatment for this patient population. This marks the sixth indication for Imbruvica in the U.S. J&J stock has gained 15.8% year to date, outperforming the 10.9% rally of the industry it belongs to.Bristol-Myers in Acquisition Deal Worth Up to $2.3B: Bristol-Myers announced that it will be acquiring IFM Therapeutics, a venture-backed biotech company working on treatments that modulate novel targets in the innate immune system to treat cancer, autoimmunity and inflammatory disorders.With this acquisition, Bristol-Myers will gain full rights to IFM’s preclinical STING (stimulator of interferon genes) and NLRP3 agonist programs that are focused on cancer. The STING agonist program includes a lead asset while the NLRP3 agonist program includes a potential first-in-class pipeline candidate.This acquisition, scheduled to close in the third quarter, will strengthen Bristol-Myers’ immune-oncology (IO) pipeline. The deal will see Bristol-Myers shelling out $300 million upfront while additional payments of up to $1.01 billion will be made for each of the first products from the two programs on the achievement of certain milestones.Additional milestone payments could be made for further products resulting from these programs.Bristol-Myers signed another IO focused deal this week -- the company signed a clinical collaboration agreement with Clovis Oncology under which its immunotherapy Opdivo will be evaluated in combination with Clovis’ PARP inhibitor Rubraca in mid- and late-stage studies for different types of tumors.Meanwhile, Opdivo’s label was expanded in the U.S. this week for the treatment of adult and pediatric (12 years and older) patients with microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) that has progressed following treatment with a fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan. Accelerated approval was granted on the basis of overall response rate (ORR) and duration of response.However, we note that Merck’s Keytruda gained approval earlier this year for patients with MSI-H or dMMR in a wider patient population -- Merck’s label includes patients with solid tumors that have progressed following prior treatment and who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options as well as colorectal cancer patients whose disease has progressed following treatment with certain chemotherapy drugs.J&J RA Drug Fails to Get FDA Advisory Panel Support: J&J’s investigational rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment, Plivensia (sirukumab), an IL-6 inhibitor, failed to get the support of the FDA’s Arthritis Advisory Committee on safety concerns. The company is looking to get Plivensia approved for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active RA who have had an inadequate response or are intolerant to one or more disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). RA is a common, chronic, life-long, autoimmune disease that affects about 1.3 million people in the U.S. Although the FDA is not required to do so, it usually follows the advice of its advisory panels. Considering the safety concerns raised by the panel, the agency could well ask for additional information before granting approval.Pfizer Drug Gets Advisory Panel Support: Pfizer’s supplemental new drug applications (sNDAs) for its JAK inhibitor, Xeljanz (5 mg twice daily) and Xeljanz XR (11 mg once daily), for the treatment of adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA), got the support of the FDA’s Arthritis Advisory Committee. The advisory panel voted 10 to 1 in favor of approving the proposed dose of Xeljanz for the PsA indication. A decision from the FDA should be out by Dec 2017. Xeljanz, currently approved for RA, brought in sales of $587 million in the first half of 2017.Priority Review for AstraZeneca BTK Inhibitor: AstraZeneca’s (AZN  -  Free Report) investigational BTK inhibitor, acalabrutinib, was granted priority review by the FDA. The company is looking to get the drug approved for use in patients with relapsed/refractory mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) who have received at least one prior therapy. A response from the agency is expected in the first quarter of 2018. Acalabrutinib was also given Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) for this indication.AstraZeneca’s Imfinzi also got BTD this week for the treatment of patients with locally-advanced, unresectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose disease has not progressed following platinum-based chemoradiation therapy.Positive Data on Lilly Migraine Drug: Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) presented late-stage data on its investigational migraine drug, lasmiditan, saying that it met the primary endpoint as well as key secondary endpoints. The results were consistent with results presented from an earlier late-stage study. Lilly expects to file for FDA approval in the second half of 2018.Lilly is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock.

1202,LLY,"Array BioPharma (ARRY  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has accepted for review its two New Drug Applications (NDAs), seeking approval for the combination of binimetinib 45 mg twice daily and encorafenib 450 mg once daily (COMBO450) to treat patients with BRAF-mutant advanced, unresectable or metastatic melanoma. The FDA has set an action date of June 30, 2018 for both applications.The NDA submissions were supported by an encouraging data from phase III COLUMBUS study (n=1577), conducted in two parts.Array’s shares have underperformed the industry year to date. The stock has been up 14.9% compared with the industry’s gain of 16.5% in the same time frame.In September 2016, Array had announced a positive top-line data from part 1 of the phase III study. The results from this evaluation showed that the combination (COMBO450) of (45 mg twice daily) and encorafenib (450 mg once daily) have significantly improved the progression-free survival (PFS) in comparison to Roche Holding AG’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Zelboraf (vemurafenib), thus meeting the primary endpoint. Additionally, the combo therapy was generally well-tolerated and all adverse events were consistent with previous trials.In May 2017, the company had further revealed a positive data from part 2 of the COLUMBUS study, which was specifically designed to evaluate the given combination (COMBO300) by reducing encorafenib’s dose to 300mg compared with its lower dosage.In fact, the median PFS for patients treated with COMBO300 was 12.9 months compared with the 9.2 months for patients treated with single agent encorafenib. This fusion was also endured well during the study.Currently, Array is evaluating encorafenib, in collaboration with Eli Lilly and Company’s (LLY  -  Free Report) Erbitux (cetuximab) with or without binimetinib, in the phase III BEACON CRC study in patients with BRAF V600E-mutant colorectal cancer. This experimental trial is being performed under a Special Protocol Assessment (“SPA”) with the FDA. Patient enrollment for the same is expected to be complete in 2018.We remind investors that Array had regained development and commercialization rights for binimetinib from Novartis Pharma AG (NVS  -  Free Report) in March 2015.Array BioPharma Inc.

1203,LLY,"AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) shares increased almost 2% after the company announced that its oral JAK-1 selective inhibitor, upadacitinib (ABT-494), met primary endpoints in a phase III study for treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).In fact, AbbVie’s shares have rallied 38.9%, outperforming the industry’s 15.8% rise so far this year.The phase III SELECT-BEYOND study is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel group study. It is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of two doses (15 mg and 30 mg) of upadacitinib compared with placebo over 12 weeks in patients with moderate-to-severe RA, who are on a stable dose of conventional synthetic DMARDs and have had shown an inadequate response to the dosage.The study met its primary endpoints with highly statistically significant and clinically meaningful results for both the doses as compared to placebo. The trial’s primary endpoints were ACR20 responses and low disease activity (LDA).The results showed that 65% of patients, receiving 15 mg and 56% of patients, administered with 30 mg dose once daily of upadacitinib, achieved ACR20 responses after 12 weeks of treatment in comparison to 28% of patients receiving placebo.LDA was achieved by 43% and 42% of patients in the 15 mg and 30 mg dose arms, respectively, compared with 14% of patients receiving placebo. Additionally, the study met its secondary endpoints too.Notably, SELECT-BEYOND is the second out of the six ongoing phase III studies in the SELECT RA clinical trial program, conducted on upadacitinib.Other researches are also underway for upadacitinib for treating Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis and atopic dermatitis.We remind investors that last week, the company announced upadacitinib to having met primary endpoints in a phase IIb study for atopic dermatitis. The company plans to advance the candidate into phase III studies next year for the given indication.We note that AbbVie already has a strong presence in the RA market with its blockbuster drug, Humira. However, several companies are working on developing biosimilar versions of Humira which could induce competition in the market for the company. Also, the RA market is extremely crowded including drugs like Johnson & Johnson’s Simponi and UCB’s Cimzia among others.Significantly, Eli Lilly’s (LLY  -  Free Report) JAK inhibitor, Olumiant, was recently approved in the EU and Pfizer’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Xeljanz is marketed in the United States for treating RA, which might pose a strong competition for upadacitinib on approval.Also, Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) has already received approval to market a Humira biosimilar but the drug has not been launched yet due to ongoing litigation. If upadacitinib is approved, it may reduce the potential negative impact of Humira generics on AbbVie’s top line.AbbVie Inc. PriceAbbVie Inc. Price | AbbVie Inc.

1204,LLY,"Eli Lilly & Company (LLY  -  Free Report) announced plans on Thursday to reduce its global workforce by approximately 3,500 positions. These initiatives are expected to amass annualized savings of approximately $500 million, beginning 2018. The drug giant plans to invest the savings in new drugs and overall growth of the company.Lilly is looking forward to launch two new medicines by the end of next year, probably galcanezumab for migraine prevention and galcanezumab and abemaciclib for breast cancer.Shares of Lilly were up 1.3% on Thursday. So far this year, Lilly’s share price has risen 10.8% compared with an increase of 12.6% for the industry.Lilly expects most of the layoffs to come from a U.S. voluntary early retirement program that it is offering to some employees. This plan is expected to be completed by December. It is also closing down several sites, a plant in Iowa, a R&D office in New Jersey and a R&D center in China to save costs.The job cuts are not expected to affect Lilly's adjusted earnings forecast for 2017. Lilly expects to achieve total operating expense efficiency of 49% or less of revenues by the end of 2018. Earlier, the company had expected operating expense efficiency of 50% or less.Lilly faces its share of challenges. Several key drugs in its portfolio like Zyprexa and Cymbalta are facing generic competition due to loss of exclusivity. Meanwhile, blockbuster drug, Alimta’s U.S. sales are also being affected by the entry of immuno-oncology agents in the market while outside U.S. sales are already being hurt due to loss of exclusivity in several countries.Other headwinds include competition from immuno-oncology agents as well as recent high-profile pipeline setbacks, the latest being a delay in approval of its rheumatoid arthritis candidate, baricitinib, in the United States. Also, Lilly’s Animal Health segment did not do too well in the first half due to worldwide competitive pressure. The cost savings will likely help Lilly offset the impact of some of these challenges to an extent.Lilly carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked biotech stocks include Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

1205,LLY,"Last week, several pharma majors reported second quarter results. Meanwhile, important study data was released by Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) and AstraZeneca (AZN  -  Free Report).Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesA Look at Q2 Earnings Results: Big pharma companies like Merck, Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report), Glaxo, Roche, Bristol-Myers (BMY  -  Free Report) and AstraZeneca reported second quarter results last week. Bristol-Myers, Lilly and Merck all beat expectations. While Merck maintained its outlook for the year (Read more: Merck Beats on Q2 Earnings and Sales, Keeps 2017 View), Bristol-Myers updated the same (Read more: Bristol-Myers Beats on Q2 Earnings, Tweaks 2017 View). Lilly was hit by its baricitinib update despite reporting a “beat and raise” quarter (Read more: Key Takeaways from Lilly's Q2 Call: Baricitinib, Cancer Pipeline). Meanwhile, AstraZeneca’s results were over-shadowed by disappointing MYSTIC data on Imfinzi in treatment-naïve non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with the company’s shares falling 14.9% (Read more: AstraZeneca Beats on Q2 Earnings, Falls on Failed Study).British drugmaker Glaxo set out new priorities for the company with the company deciding to allocate 80% of capital to priority assets in two current (respiratory and HIV/infectious diseases) and two potential (oncology and immuno-inflammation) therapy areas. Glaxo also said that more than 30 pre-clinical and clinical programs will be stopped (Read more: GlaxoSmithKline Beats on Q2 Earnings, Lowers Guidance).Lilly and Merck are both Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stocks. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Merck’s Keytruda Misses Endpoint in HNSCC Study: There were a lot of updates from Merck last week in addition to the earnings results. The company was hit by disappointing results from a late-stage study evaluating its anti-PD-1 therapy, Keytruda, as a monotherapy in patients with previously treated recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). The study failed to meet the pre-specified primary endpoint of overall survival (OS). This is the latest Keytruda-related setback for Merck. Earlier this month, the company had announced that the FDA has placed a clinical hold on three combination studies (KEYNOTE-183, KEYNOTE-185 and KEYNOTE-023) being conducted with Keytruda for multiple myeloma (MM).Meanwhile, a look at Merck’s second quarter results shows that Keytruda remains strong in the lung cancer setting. Keytruda is currently in more than 550 studies including more than 300 combination studies.Merck-AstraZeneca Sign Oncology Collaboration: Merck and AstraZeneca will be collaborating for the global development and commercialization of Merck’s Keytruda and AstraZeneca’s PARP inhibitor Lynparza for different types of cancer. Lynparza, currently approved for BRCA-mutated ovarian cancer in multiple lines of treatment, is in different studies for a range of tumor types including breast, prostate and pancreatic cancers. The deal will cover the evaluation of PARP and MEK inhibitors with PD-L1/PD-1 inhibitors. AstraZeneca stands to receive up to $8.5 billion including an upfront payment of $1.6 billion, $750 million for certain license options and up to an additional $6.15 billion on the achievement of regulatory and sales milestones.Merck stock has gained 8.9% year to date (YTD), lagging the 10.5% rally of the industry it belongs to while AstraZeneca has gained 10.8% YTD.J&J’s Janssen Inks Deal with Bavarian Nordic: Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies and Denmark-based biotech company Bavarian Nordic entered into an additional worldwide exclusive license and collaboration agreement under which Janssen will get exclusive rights to Bavarian Nordic’s MVA-BN technology for two additional programs targeting vaccines against hepatitis B virus (HBV) and HIV-1.J&J will make an upfront payment of $10 million and an equity investment worth $33 million. Bavarian Nordic will also be eligible to receive milestone payments worth up to $836 million plus tiered royalties on future sales.With this deal, the companies are now collaborating for four programs combining Bavarian Nordic’s MVA-BN technology with Janssen’s AdVac technology platform.Pfizer-Astellas’ Xtandi Breast Cancer Program Dropped: Astellas, which reported results last week, provided an update on its pipeline which showed that the company and its partner, Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report), have decided to drop the development of Xtandi for breast cancer. The development program included a phase III study for triple negative breast cancer and a phase II study for ER/PR positive, HER2 positive breast cancer. Astellas said that the decision was based on discussions with Pfizer, the change in the competitive landscape, need for further diagnostic development and new phase II data.Ongoing programs for Xtandi include non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (phase III), prostate cancer in patients with non-metastatic biochemical recurrence (phase III), metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (phase III) and hepatocellular cancer (phase II).PerformanceLarge Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % Return Large Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % ReturnThe NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index declined 1.8% over the last five trading sessions. Among major stocks, Merck was up 2.4% while AstraZeneca lost 11.1%. Over the last six months, J&J was up 17.8% while Bristol-Myers gained 17.4% (See the last pharma stock roundup here: J&J, NVS' Q2 Earnings, Merck Drug Gets Tentative FDA Nod).What's Next in the Pharma World?Watch out for second quarter earnings results from companies like Pfizer, Shire (SHPG  -  Free Report) and Allergan (AGN  -  Free Report) among others. Moreover, the FDA’s Arthritis Advisory Committee will be meeting on Aug 2 to discuss J&J’s regulatory application for its investigational rheumatoid arthritis treatment, Plivensia (sirukumab).More Stock News: 8 Companies Verge on Apple-Like RunDid you miss Apple's 9X stock explosion after they launched their iPhone in 2007?

1207,LLY,"There were quite a few important developments this week with Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) announcing that it is streamlining its operations and cutting down its workforce as it focuses on developing new medicines and improving its cost structure. Meanwhile, Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) announced that its CEO will be stepping down in 2018.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesLilly to Streamline Operations, Cut Jobs: Lilly announced a restructuring plan which will see the company streamlining operations so that it can focus on developing new medicines and improving its cost structure. The company will be cutting down 3,500 jobs with most of the reductions expected from a U.S. voluntary early retirement program. Lilly will also be closing down certain sites and will move production from its Larchwood, IA animal health manufacturing facility to an existing plant in Fort Dodge, IA. A research and development office in Bridgewater, NJ, and the Lilly China Research and Development Center in Shanghai, China, will also shut down.Lilly expects to generate annualized savings of about $500 million from 2018 – this will be used toward improving the cost structure, new product launches and label expansion studies. The streamlining program will result in the company incurring pre-tax charges of about $1.2 billion (post-tax charges of 80 cents per share) which will be recognized in the third and fourth quarters of 2017. While this will cut down the reported earnings guidance, adjusted earnings outlook remains unchanged. Lilly also said that with its streamlining efforts, it now expects to achieve an OPEX-to-revenue ratio of 49% or less in 2018, indicating an improvement from its previous forecast.Merck to Buy Rigontec in Immuno-Oncology Focused Deal: The immune-oncology space continues to attract the interest of big pharma players with Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) announcing its intention to acquire Rigontec in a deal worth up to €464 million including an upfront payment of €115 million. Rigontec's expertise lies in accessing the retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) pathway, which is a part of the innate immune system, with the goal of inducing both immediate and long-term anti-tumor immunity. The acquisition will add Rigontec’s lead candidate, RGT100, to Merck’s pipeline. RGT100 is currently in early-stage development in patients with various tumors (Also read: Merck Opts for Buying German Immuno-Oncology Biotech).Merck also announced that the European Commission has expanded the label of its anti-PD-1 therapy, Keytruda, for the treatment of certain patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma, a type of bladder cancer (Also read: Merck's Keytruda Gets EU Approval for Bladder Cancer).BMY’s Opdivo Impresses in RCC Study: Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) had some mixed news on its PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor Opdivo. The company said that  a late-stage study (CheckMate -214) evaluating Opdivo plus Yervoy  was stopped early for showing overall survival (“OS”) benefit in patients with previously untreated advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (“RCC”).Following a planned interim analysis, an independent Data Monitoring Committee (“DMC”) recommended that the study should be stopped early. The combination would provide RCC patients with a new first-line treatment option. Approval for this indication would boost sales significantly. There is significant unmet need in this area with RCC being the most common type of kidney cancer in adults with a five-year survival rate for the advanced or metastatic stage being 12.1%.The second set of Opdivo related news was not so encouraging with the company saying that a partial clinical hold has been placed by the FDA on three Opdivo-based combination studies in multiple myeloma. The FDA decided to place the studies on partial hold following the identification of risks identified in combination studies evaluating Merck’s Keytruda for multiple myeloma.Mylan Faces 3-Month Delay in Herceptin Biosimilar Decision: Mylan NV (MYL  -  Free Report) and partner Biocon will have to wait a bit longer before they get a response from the FDA for their biosimilar version of Roche’s blockbuster drug, Herceptin (trastuzumab). The FDA informed Mylan that it is extending the target action date by three months so that it can review some of the clarificatory information submitted to them as a part of the application review process. As a result, the regulatory body will now issue a response regarding the approval status of the biosimilar on Dec 3, 2017.The biosimilar version had received a favorable vote (16-0) in July from the FDA’s Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (“ODAC”). Herceptin is approved for a wide range of indications including HER2+ breast cancer in the metastatic and adjuvant settings.Novartis CEO to Retire in 2018, Replacement Announced: Novartis’ CEO, Joseph Jimenez, will be stepping down from his position in 2018. The Board of Directors has appointed Vasant (Vas) Narasimhan, M.D., Global Head of Drug Development and Chief Medical Officer, as his successor, effective Feb 1, 2018 (Also read: Narasimhan to Replace Jimenez as Novartis CEO in 2018). Novartis' stock has gained 17.1% year to date, outperforming the 12.7% rally of the industry it belongs to. Novartis is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.FDA Issues Warning Letter to Pfizer: Pfizer got a warning letter from the FDA regarding its manufacturing facility, Meridian Medical Technologies, Inc. at Brentwood, MO. The letter mentions significant violations of current good manufacturing practice (“CGMP”) requirements for combination products. The company has been accused of failing to thoroughly investigate several serious component and product failures for its EpiPen products (manufactured on behalf of Mylan), including failures associated with patient deaths and severe illness.Earlier this year in March, Meridian Medical Technologies had announced a voluntary recall of its EpiPen products following the receipt of two previously disclosed reports outside the United States of failure to activate the device due to a potential defect in a supplier component.PerformanceLarge Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % Return Large Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % ReturnThe NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index was up 1.5% over the last four trading sessions.

1208,LLY,"Cancer is the second most common cause of death in the U.S. preceded only by heart disease.The traditional cancer treatments include surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. However, immunotherapy, gene therapy and other new novel therapies are being developed to improve, supplement or replace traditional cancer treatments with the target to reduce or remove cancerous growths.According to a report by the American Cancer Society, almost 1.7 million new cancer cases are expected to be diagnosed in 2017, which creates significant need for effective cancer medication. It goes without saying that all big pharma companies are gearing up to develop and bring innovative cancer treatments to market as well as expand the labels of their marketed oncology drugs. These pharma/biotech giants have significant financial resources at their disposal and have even collaborated to pool their resources and technology.Here we discuss four pharma giants, which possess the industry’s strongest oncology pipeline portfolios.AstraZeneca (AZN  -  Free Report)AstraZeneca is working on strengthening its oncology product portfolio and has several candidates in its pipeline. The company’s target is to launch at least six new oncology medicines between 2014 and 2020, including Lynparza, Tagrisso and Imfinzi, which are already approved and marketed.An interesting candidate in the company’s immuno-oncology pipeline is Imfinzi (durvalumab) being evaluated for multiple cancers (either alone or in combination with other regimens), including phase III trials in combination with tremelimumab in first-line urothelial cancer, NSCLC, small cell lung cancer and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) among others. Imfinzi was launched in the U.S. for the first indication – second line advanced bladder cancer - in May 2017.Other phase III oncology candidates in AstraZeneca’s pipeline include acalabrutinib (blood cancers.), moxetumomab pasudotox (leukaemia), selumetinib (thyroid cancer) and savolitinib (kidney cancer).Lynparza, presently marketed for advanced ovarian cancer, is also in different studies for a range of tumor types including breast, prostate and pancreatic cancers as well as earlier-line settings for ovarian cancer. Tagrisso is also being evaluated in earlier-line settings for lung cancer.AstraZeneca carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.So far this year, AstraZeneca’s shares have moved up 10%, comparing unfavorably to a 12.3% increase for the large-cap pharma industry.Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report)Pfizer’s newly approved immunotherapy, Bavencio, is being considered a significant top-line driver for this New York-based pharma giant.Bavencio/avelumab received FDA approval for metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) in March 2017 and for advanced bladder cancer in May. Bavencio is under review in the EU for MCC with a decision expected in the third quarter of 2017. Pfizer is focusing on continuously growing and expanding Bavencio into new indications and markets globally.Pfizer has also initiated avelumab double/triple combination studies for chemotherapy and targeted therapies and has 11 avelumab combination therapies with immuno-oncology agents under development.Pfizer’s two other oncology candidates have also been approved by the FDA recently – Besponsa - for relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia in August and Mylotarg for new or relapsed CD33-positive acute myeloid leukemia in September. Other cancer candidates in Pfizer’s pipeline include talazoparib (advanced breast cancer) and dacomitinib (advanced NSCLC with EGFR activating mutations).Pfizer is also aggressively working on expanding the labels of approved cancer drugs like Ibrance and Xalkori.Pfizer also carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). So far this year, Pfizer’s shares have moved up 4.1%.AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report)AbbVie is working on expanding and accelerating its presence in oncology and building upon its growing position in hematological oncologyAbbVie’s Imbruvica, currently approved for several cancer indications, has multi-billion dollar potential and AbbVie is exploring the potential to expand Imbruvica’s label into solid tumors and autoimmune diseases. AbbVie is positioning Imbruvica as a “pipeline in a molecule” - the treatment is in several company-sponsored studies.With the 2016 acquisition of cancer drugmaker, Stemcentrx AbbVie gained a late-stage candidate, rovalpituzumab tesirine or Rova-T, four additional early-stage compounds in solid tumor indications and a significant portfolio of pre-clinical assets. Rova-T is currently in registrational studies for small cell lung cancer (SCLC). A phase I, eight-arm ""basket study"" on Rova-T in neuroendocrine tumors is also ongoing. According to AbbVie, the candidate has blockbuster potential and could be launched in 2018. AbbVie intends to study the candidate for additional indications and estimates peak sales close to $5 billion.AbbVie is also studying marketed cancer drug Venclyxto/Venclexta to expand the label to address the broader relapsed/refractory CLL patient population, expand into earlier lines of therapy, and broaden into other hematologic malignancies.AbbVie also carries a Zacks Rank #3. So far this year, AbbVie’s shares have moved up 20.2%.Bristol-Myers (BMY  -  Free Report)Bristol-Myers PD-1 inhibitor, Opdivo, has been performing impressively while Bristol-Myers is working on expanding the label of Opdivo further, alone or in combination therapies with Yervoy and other anti-cancer agents.Further, Bristol-Myers’ cancer portfolio includes multiple myeloma drug, Empliciti and leukemia drug, Sprycel, contributing to the top line. In addition, Bristol-Myers is evaluating other immune system pathways for the treatment of cancer. These pathways may help the company bring to market potentially transformational immunotherapies – in combination or as monotherapy – to help fight different types of cancers.Bristol-Myers also carries a Zacks Rank #3. So far this year, Bristol-Myers’ shares have moved up 2.3%.Others Not Far BehindMerck (MRK  -  Free Report) is also conducting numerous studies to evaluate its highly successful anti-PD-1 therapy, Keytruda for more than 30 types of cancer in more than 550 studies, including more than 300 combination studies.Roche (RHHBY  -  Free Report) dominates the breast cancer space with strong demand for its HER2 franchise drugs like Herceptin, Perjeta and Kadcyla. Apart from its strong breast cancer franchise, Roche’s oncology portfolio also boasts of lung cancer drugs like Avastin and Tarceva, immuno-oncology drugs like Tecentriq and newly approved multiple sclerosis drug Ocrevus. Label expansion efforts are ongoing for all these cancer drugs.Swiss drugmaker Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) also boasts many experimental cancer drugs in its R&D pipeline including a couple of biosimilar versions of popular cancer drugs. Novartis' cancer pipeline was bolstered by the deal to buy most of Glaxo's (GSK  -  Free Report) oncology portfolio in 2014.Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) also laid out its oncology strategy at its Q2 call held in July, which involves building on key treatments like Cyramza, Lartruvo and abemaciclib as foundational agents while focusing on developing new standard-of-care changing therapies and combination regimens, including immuno-therapies.ConclusionCompetition in the cancer market is fierce and not all pipeline candidates will be successful. However, pharma biggies have enough late-stage cancer programs in their portfolios and there are chances of quite a few rollouts in the coming years.4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye On Tech stocks have been a major force behind the market’s record highs, but picking the best ones to buy can be tough.

1209,LLY,"Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) announced that its Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Joseph Jimenez will step down from his position in 2018. Vasant Narasimhan, M.D., Global Head of Drug Development and Chief Medical Officer, will replace him effective Feb 1, 2018. Narasimhan is a member of the Executive Committee and joined Novartis in 2005.Narasimhan led the Consumer Health Division and was the Division Head of Novartis Pharmaceuticals.Novartis is currently going through a transitional stage. In March 2015, Novartis acquired certain oncology products and pipeline compounds from GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK  -  Free Report) for $16 billion. In exchange, it sold its non-influenza Vaccines business to Glaxo for $7.1 billion.In January 2015, Novartis divested its Animal Health Division to Eli Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) for approximately $5.4 billion.The company’s blockbuster drug, Diovan, is facing stiff generic competition in the United States, EU and Japan. Gleevec lost exclusivity in the United States in February 2016. The company also lost patent protection for the drug in EU in December 2016 leading to generic competition. The loss of patent protection for these top-selling drugs continue to hurt sales.Of late, the performance of the Alcon business has been quite disappointing due to lower surgical equipments sales as a result of competition faced by intraocular lens and a slowdown in demand for equipment purchases. Despite the restructuring initiatives of the company, the segment’s performance remains dismal. In particular, the surgical business is taking longer to turnaround.Hence, Novartis is mulling strategic options for Alcon which includes retaining the business to separation via capital transactions such as a spin-off or an initial public offering. The company will throw light on its plans for Alcon later in 2017.Last week, the company got a boost when the FDA has approved its breakthrough gene transfer treatment, Kymriah (tisagenlecleucel) suspension for the treatment of patients up to 25 years of age with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The approval opens up new frontiers in the treatment of cancer by advancing immunocellular therapy for children and young adults with r/r B-cell ALL which comprises approximately 25% of cancer diagnoses among children under 15 years and is the most common cause of childhood cancer in the United States.Novartis stock has rallied 14.8% in the year so far compared with the industry’s 12.3% gain.Zacks Rank & Key PickNovartis currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the healthcare sector is Aduro Biotech, Inc.
