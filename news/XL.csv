1,XL,"Axa Chief Executive Officer Thomas Buberl is betting the worst is over for insurance.X His $15.3 billion purchase of XL Group (XL), the company's biggest ever, will make Axa the top provider of commercial casualty coverage just as premiums rise after last year's hurricanes and California wildfires. The deal will also allow the insurer to focus on parts of the industry that are less sensitive to financial markets, a key target for insurers after investment income was hurt by a decade of low interest rates.Shareholders were less than enthusiastic about the deal. The Paris-based firm fell the most since June 2016 after the announcement, with analyst Daniel Bischof of Baader Helvea saying that the deal has a sound logic, but the price is at the upper end of expectations. Axa is paying 57.60 a share, a premium of about one-third compared with the stock's closing price on Friday. XL's shares had gained 23% this year before Monday's announcement.The price ""means a substantial part of the expected synergies were passed on to existing shareholders,"" Bischof wrote. It should result in a lower cost of equity for Axa and reinforces the firm's growth potential, he said.Use IBD's MarketSmith For Free Until March 11

The shares were trading at 22.97 euros at 1:54 p.m. in Paris.Insurance premiums had been falling for most of the past decade, driven by a lack of natural disasters and competition from hedge funds. The $306 billion of losses last year from weather-related disasters including Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria is finally leading to increases in pricing, prompting an uptick in deals.Buberl, the 44-year-old CEO, agreed the biggest-ever purchase of a U.S. insurer by a European buyer less than two years after taking the position. Bloomberg reported Saturday that Axa was in advanced talks on the deal, citing people with knowledge of the matter. XL had also attracted interest from competitors including Germany's Allianz SE, Bloomberg reported earlier.""This is not an obvious fit for Axa,"" UBS Group analyst Colm Kelly wrote in a note to clients. In recent years, ""Axa has grown via bolt-on acquisitions to achieve scale, not large-scale M&A.""The deal does chime with Buberl's plan to focus on products that require technical expertise and regular customer contact, which may allow the firm sell additional policies to the clients. It will lead to annual pretax synergies of $400 million and will be cash-accretive, according to Axa's statement on Monday.""From a P&C perspective, Axa needed in my view a stronger presence in the U.S."" Davide Serra, CEO of money manager Algebris Investments, said in an interview on Bloomberg Television. Focusing on that segment ""over the medium term, it's a safer bet.""The insurer plans to finance the acquisition using cash in hand, subordinated debt and proceeds from an IPO of its existing U.S. operations. It's also arranged 9 billion euros ($11 billion) of backup bridge financing.The IPO, which Axa announced last year, will see the insurer list its U.S. Life & Savings unit and its 64% stake in AllianceBernstein (AB) in the second quarter. Axa plans to accelerate its sell-off of the combined businesses following the XL deal.Companies like XL Group have become takeover targets after the heavy toll of natural disasters last year pushed prices for coverage higher. Last month, the firm's CEO Michael McGavick said he was optimistic about XL's progress on the back of a solid capital position and growth in premiums.The biggest insurance takeover this year had been January's American International Group (AIG) agreement to buy Validus Holdings Ltd. for more than $5 billion in cash. SoftBank Group wants to buy a stake in reinsurer Swiss Re AG and Phoenix Group Holdings is buying Standard Life Aberdeen's insurance business.Formerly a regional insurer in Normandy, Axa built itself into Europe's second-largest insurer through major takeovers in the 1990s. Recent deals have been smaller-scale, acquiring assets or setting up partnerships in emerging markets including China, Nigeria and Colombia.

5,XL,"Despite the daily pounding he receives from the media, President Trump enjoys two advantages — low expectations and lots of time.When the opposition party and their media cohorts call Trump an idiot, a fool, a liar, racist, sexist, homophobic, anti-immigrant, anti-Mexican, incompetent, lazy, unfocused, greedy, hateful, fascist, tyrannical and/or Hitler-esque, there's really nowhere to go but up.Recall how immediately after Trump took office, ""experts"" predicted a short administration, perhaps of months-long duration. Critics said Trump did not really think he would win. The recent anti-Trump book by Michael Wolff even claims that Trump did not want to win. Some even predicted that Trump, having captured the presidency, would grow bored and quickly return to his construction business.This brings us to Trump's second advantage: time. There is a long time between now and November, let alone between now and the end of Trump's second term. The piling-on in the first year and a half of the Trump presidency contradicts a reality, quite annoying to Trump bashers: The man is fulfilling one campaign promise after another.The Obama administration, for example, complained about our NATO partners' failure to spend the expected amount on national security. After Trump loudly complained that only five of the 29 member nations spend the minimum NATO requirement of 2% of their gross domestic product on defense; that America was being used and financially ripped off by an ""obsolete"" NATO, which doesn't fight terrorism; and that member nations need to ""promptly pay their bills,"" what happened? Several members pledged to increased their military spending.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseHow many Republican presidential candidates over the years complained about the ban on drilling for oil in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, known as ANWR? Trump signed legislation to begin the process of repealing the ban. Trump successfully appointed more federal appellate judges than any first-year president in history. Trump lowered the corporate tax rate, once the highest statutory rate in the industrialized world. Trump, as promised, eliminated or delayed numerous job-killing regulations. He approved the construction of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines.The stock market has repeatedly reached all-time highs, and for the first time in years, polls show that Americans believe young peoples' lives will be better than their parents'. An April 2018 Gallup poll found 61% believe today's youth ""will have a better life than their parents did,"" the highest mark since 2010.When Trump derisively called North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un ""rocket man,"" critics practically counted down our remaining days on earth before we would see mushroom clouds. As the only President ever with neither political nor military experience, Trump was called everything from a warmonger to naive. In January, former Vice President Joe Biden said, ""(North Korea) is not a game. This is not about 'can I puff my chest out bigger than yours.' (Trump's threat) is just not — it's not presidential.""President Trump, shortly after taking office, placed American aircraft carriers in the Sea of Japan. Three aircraft carriers and their multi-ship strike groups conducted war exercises in mid-November. Well, well. It was not long after this that Kim Jong Un became the first North Korean dictator to set foot on South Korean soil. Kim announced plans to end the 68-year-old Korean War and even promised to ""denuclearize,"" as Trump demanded as a condition of removing economic sanctions.Ronald Reagan would caution the new President to ""trust, but verify,"" and there's a long way to go before Trump can declare victory on the North Korean issue. But even Trump haters, whether or not they give Trump credit, must admit that the world is better off with a North Korea without nuclear weapons.Trump's achievements are all the more impressive given that from the beginning of his presidency he has been under investigation for allegedly ""colluding"" with the Russians to win the election. The collusion investigation has apparently evolved into an investigation of lying to investigators, obstruction of justice, money laundering and possible campaign finance violation over the $130K payoff to porn star Stormy Daniels.There is an irony here. Many of the Trump bashers cheering special counsel Robert Mueller's probe also called the impeachment of President Bill Clinton a ""witch hunt."" To this day, many believe Congress impeached Clinton because of his extramarital affair in the White House with an intern. In fact, the House impeached him because he lied under oath and committed obstruction of justice. He was later found in contempt of court for lying and temporarily lost his license to practice law.Former California Republican Congressman James Rogan was a House manager, one of the House members who agreed to prosecute Clinton in the Senate. Rogan, now a judge, said that had Congress done nothing to Clinton it would have set a precedent that a president can, without consequences, lie under oath. And if a president can lie under oath, argued Rogan, why can't any person justify or rationalize lying under oath?Had Clinton not been impeached, and had the precedent been established that presidents could lie under oath, Trump would have little to fear from a ""perjury trap.""Other columns by Larry Elder

6,XL,"Obama Legacy: This week, the Trump administration announced that it would revise President Obama's draconian auto fuel economy mandates. That alone is big news. But it marks the near total reversal of Obama's anti-growth domestic policies. That's bigger news.EPA head Scott Pruitt said Tuesday that the administration would rewrite Obama's fuel economy standards starting with model year 2022. Obama's plan was to mandate that all cars sold average 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025, up from 38.3 mpg this year.As we have repeatedly explained in this space, Obama's fuel economy mandate was little more than a thinly disguised electric car mandate, since hitting that level would have required a substantial increase in plug-in sales. As it stands, there are only a handful of powered cars that can go more than 54 miles on a gallon of gas.Pruitt said that, instead of trying to force consumers into more expensive cars that environmentalists like, the focus at the EPA will be ""on making cars that people actually buy and that are efficient.""We'd prefer it if the government chucked this fuel economy mandate altogether. Consumers already have a wide range of choices when it comes to mileage. And fuel economy mandates in the past have forced the industry to shrink car sizes, making them less safe.Even so, it's a huge blow to one of Obama's much heralded policy victories.When he announced the fuel standards in 2011, Obama declared that were ""the single most important step we've ever taken as a nation to reduce our dependence on foreign oil."" As it turns out, it was fracking that was the most important step.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThis isn't the first of Obama's policies enacted during his eight years in office that Trump has killed off in his first 14 months.Trans-Pacific Partnership. Obama heralded the TPP as a ""defining trade deal"" and said it would ""bolster our leadership abroad and support good jobs here at home."" Trump ditched it shortly after taking office.Clean Power Plan. Obama called this massive expensive proposal ""the single most important step America has ever taken in the fight against global climate change."" Critics noted it would cost a total of $100 billion by 2030 and even the Obama administration admitted that it would do nothing to prevent climate change. Trump ordered the EPA to withdraw the rules in April.Keystone XL. Obama tried to kill this pipeline, which would bring Canadian oil down to refineries in the south, saying it ""would not serve the national interest of the United States."" Trump overturned that decision, and construction on this critical piece of infrastructure is set to begin next year.Clean Water Rule. Obama said the EPA's expansive Clean Water Rule would ""restore protection for the streams and wetlands that form the foundation of our nation's water resources."" But it also gave the government the unprecedented ability to regulate almost any type of water. Trump suspended the rules in January.Paris Climate Agreement. In December 2015, Obama announced that he'd signed on to the Paris agreement, under which countries volunteered to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions to set levels, ""a turning point for the world."" Since then, the UN has admitted that various countries aren't making good on their CO2 pledges, and that even if they did, they wouldn't make a difference in terms of global warming. Trump pulled America out of it in June 2017.Net Neutrality. When the FCC announced that it was imposing 1930s era telephone regulations on the internet in the name of ""net neutrality,"" Obama said it would ""protect innovation and create a level playing field for the next generation of entrepreneurs."" Nobody who looked at the FCC's terrible track record would believe such a thing. And Trump's FCC head, Ajit Pai, rescinded the rules in December.Dodd-Frank. One of Obama's biggest ""successes"" was arguably the Dodd-Frank banking bill, which imposed a vast array of new regulations on the financial sector, most of which sought to fix alleged problems that had nothing to do with the financial crisis. Obama boasted as he signed the bill that ""these reforms represent the strongest consumer financial protections in history. In history."" He said it would ""rein in the abuse and excess that nearly brought down our financial system."" None of that turned out to be true, as subsequent studies showed. And one of the impacts Dodd-Frank did have was to push countless local community banks out of business. In a rare show of bipartisanship, 17 Democrats joined 50 Republicans and voted this March to roll back much of Dodd-Frank. The House already passed a broader Dodd-Frank overhaul, so now it's just a matter of bringing the two bills together.Taxes. Obama spent eight years claiming that the rich didn't pay their ""fair share"" of taxes and pushing, often successfully, for tax hikes. The claim was false, and his tax policies helped slow the economic recovery. In December, Trump signed a tax bill that marked a 180-degree departure from Obama's tax policies, and renounced Obama's class warfare rhetoric, by cutting income tax rates across the board, including for those at the top, while slashing the corporate tax rate.On immigration, oil exploration, education reform, and other areas, Trump is also dismantling Obama policies.So what remains?Just 14 months after Trump took office, the only major domestic policy achievement that Obama has left is ObamaCare.But while Trump and the Republicans failed to repeal it last year, they are busy chipping away at it. The tax bill ended ObamaCare's mandate penalty and got rid of other noxious provisions. Trump is also working to expand access to other insurance options besides the overpriced ObamaCare plans.What is remarkable isn't just the speed with which Trump has dismantled most of Obama's legacy, or the fact that the economy has responded with a surge of optimism, stronger GDP growth, and healthy gains in jobs and wages.What's remarkable is that the mainstream press has almost entirely ignored these developments, as it focuses instead on such important matters as Trump's tweets, his sex life and a bogus Russia investigation.As long as Trump continues to move in this policy direction, we're happy that the liberal press is too distracted to notice.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Don't Believe The Class Warriors: America's Income-Tax Code Doesn't Favor The RichThe Stunning Statistical Fraud Behind The Global Warming ScareObamaCare Is The Real Junk Insurance, And It's Killing People

7,XL,"Two years ago, then-candidate Donald Trump laid out an ""America First"" energy plan, stating that under his presidency, ""American energy dominance will be declared a strategic, economic and foreign policy goal of the United States. It's about time.""Making good on that promise two months into his presidency, President Trump began to roll back burdensome regulations on domestic energy production. He then moved on, approving the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines and, most recently, releasing a new draft five-year offshore oil and natural gas leasing plan that could greatly expand the federal areas where drilling is allowed.All of this bodes well for the long-term energy security of the United States which, thanks to the shale revolution, has made a remarkable transition from energy dependence to a nation on track to become a net energy exporter by 2022.Yet all this good news is overshadowed by President Trump's approach to trade. His threats to walk away from the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) and imposition of broad punitive tariffs on imported steel and aluminum are inconsistent with his commitment to rev up U.S. economic activity and energy output.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseNafta affects nearly every sector of the U.S. economy. The three nations party to the 24-year-old agreement — the United States, Canada and Mexico — make up the world's largest free trade area and account for $1.1 trillion worth of U.S. trade.Trump has labeled the agreement a ""disaster"" and has called for it to be renegotiated. But his threats to withdraw from the agreement would hurt not only Nafta's core industries, like agriculture and auto manufacturing, it would also harm U.S. energy producers and consumers.Energy trade between Nafta participants provides the underpinning for North America's growing energy self-sufficiency and remains a major economic driver for the United States. Mexico accounts for more than 60% of U.S. natural gas exports; Canada takes 61% of U.S. oil exports. Over the past two decades, Nafta has forged an integrated North American energy market that benefits all participants. Americans benefit not only from the economic trade, but from jobs and more affordable energy.As Karen Harbert, president and CEO of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's Global Energy Institute put it, ""The U.S. energy economy has nothing to fear from Nafta — and a lot to gain. A modernized Nafta could help solidify the recent advances and create advantages for North American industry, advancing market-based integration of the energy sector, including energy production, transportation and processing, as well as electricity generation, transmission and distribution.""While there's little dispute over whether the nearly quarter-century-old trade agreement is overdue for modernization, scrapping it altogether would hurt the industries directly covered by Nafta even more than the energy sector.American farmers send 30% of all agricultural exports to Mexico and Canada. Since Nafta was implemented agricultural exports to those countries have totaled $310 billion, with trade increasing by more than 300%. Abandoning the agreement could cause Mexico and Canada to respond with tariffs on U.S. agricultural goods, making American farmers less competitive.U.S. automakers and their workers have also benefited under Nafta. Global exports of American-built vehicles have doubled since the agreement went into effect. Since 2009, vehicle exports have increased by 52% to Canada and 51% to Mexico. Withdrawing from Nafta could increase costs and make U.S. automakers less competitive globally.After years of recession followed by a sluggish recovery, the U.S. economy is finally starting to gain momentum thanks to the Republican tax cuts. The president's commitment to remove regulatory obstacles and open new federal areas to exploration is hastening the country down the path to energy dominance.Tearing up an agreement with our two closest trading partners would put the United States at a disadvantage with global competitors and undercut the economic investment incentive that American companies received under tax reform. In the next round of negotiations set for April in Washington, D.C., the Trump administration should work with Canada and Mexico to modernize and strengthen an agreement that has proven mutually beneficial to all involved.Walking away from Nafta now would dim the lights on a bright energy and economic future for all Americans.You Might Also Like:Fix Nafta, Don't Break ItThe Winning Case For Free TradeHigh Tariffs And Weak Dollar Are No Way To Make America Great Again Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

14,XL,"Bill Cowher relied on three guiding principles for himself and for his teams.They came from his father, an insurance auditor, and were a product of growing up in the steel-tough city of Pittsburgh.Cowher wound up coaching his hometown Steelers from 1992 to 2006, winning over 60% of his games and capturing a Super Bowl title. In the process he amassed Hall of Fame-worthy coaching credentials.""No. 1: Never quit; finish whatever you start,"" Cowher, 60, told IBD. ""Don't ever quit, because if you quit once, you'll quit again. ... Even (those) players finishing a running test — it may not be the time they want, but just learn to finish. Finish things, finish anything.""The second thing is you have to work harder than the other person. Your work ethic is really defined by what you do when no one is watching. What sacrifices are you making? Are you putting in the extra time and study?""And the third thing is never be intimidated by anyone or anything — self-confidence. Because if you don't have confidence in yourself, how can others have confidence in you?""Respectful but unfazed by taking over for the legendary Chuck Noll, Cowher's NFL regular season head-coaching record in 15 seasons was 149-90-1 — good for a .623 winning percentage. And good enough to put him 25th on the all-time list, even though most in that top echelon coached for fewer than Cowher's 15 seasons and many for far fewer. His 149 wins puts him 20th among all NFL head coaches in history, and all those ahead of him coached more than Cowher's 15 seasons.Cowher led the Steelers to the playoffs 10 times, for a 12-9 record and a .571 winning percentage. Under Cowher the Steelers reached the Super Bowl twice, winning Super Bowl XL in 2006 vs. the Seattle Seahawks.""Coaching is about teaching,"" Cowher said. ""You have to be able to motivate to teach, and surround yourself with assistant coaches who are also very good teachers. You have to surround yourself with a lot of people that think the way you think. You have to be patient, but yet demanding. You have to have structure, but be flexible.""You have to keep your team focused. Continue to make the changes that you have to make as long as the changes allow you to grow collectively. And the biggest thing you have to do is hold people accountable.""""He was one of the most competitive people I've ever been around,"" said former NFL head coach Chan Gailey, who was an assistant under Cowher from 1994-97. ""He wanted to win and he conveyed that to everyone in the organization.""He was tough but fair. He coached the game the way he played the game — he was all in.""""Cowher did a wonderful job of making that personal connection with his players by consistently showing us that he cared and wanted all of his players to be successful on and off the football field,"" said former Steelers star running back Barry Foster. ""He would offer coaching advice about football specifics, but he also asked about your family, where you grew up. ...""Gailey said Cowher gave his assistant coaches autonomy and respect. ""He made us feel like our job was really important. He had suggestions, he had things he wanted done, but he wasn't one that interfered with what you were trying to do.""After Cowher retired he became a studio analyst for the CBS pregame show, ""The NFL Today,"" This season will be Cowher's 11th, as the show celebrates its 50th anniversary. He's also part of the network's ""Thursday Night Football"" team.""I see so many similarities in the way the (Rooney family) ran the Steelers and the way Les Moonves, Sean McManus, David Berson run CBS,"" Cowher said. ""It's very family oriented, but still holding people very accountable. It's forward-thinking in the things they want to do, along with great respect for the product that they have.""Cowher's performance as the public face of the Steelers for 15 years might have impressed TV executives. ""Cowher showed great professionalism during TV interviews while praising opposing teams, coaches and players,"" Foster said. ""When I would see him in the Pittsburgh community, he was always approachable and friendly with the fans ... a very genuine guy.""Born in Crafton, Pa., a suburb of Pittsburgh, Cower attended North Carolina State University from 1974 to 1978, where he played linebacker, first under legendary coach Lou Holtz and then Bo Rein. He was the team captain and named its Most Valuable Player in his senior year.Cowher then tried out for the Philadelphia Eagles as an undrafted free agent and didn't make the team. He returned to N.C. State and earned his degree in 1979 while also becoming a graduate assistant for the football team.He also determinedly pursued his goal of playing in the NFL, and in 1980 Cowher was signed by the Cleveland Browns. He made a name for himself in the league as a special-teams player while also being a backup linebacker for three years under defensive coordinator Marty Schottenheimer.After Schottenheimer became the Browns' head coach, he offered Cowher the position of special teams coach in 1985. Cowher was then with the Eagles and decided he'd have a better future in coaching than playing, and took the opportunity.Steadily moving up in coaching responsibilities, Cowher was the Browns' special teams coach for two years and then coached their defensive backfield. When Schottenheimer became the head coach of the Kansas City Chiefs in 1989, Cowher went with him, promoted to defensive coordinator.When the Steelers were looking for a new head coach in 1992 to replace four-time Super Bowl champ Chuck Noll, Cowher was hired at 34 years old. He was taking over a Steelers team that had only been to the playoffs one time in the previous seven years.Cowher took stock of what he'd learned from observing successful coaches like Holtz, Dick Vermeil, and Schottenheimer, one of only seven coaches in NFL history with 200 or more career wins.""The big thing I learned from all those guys is they were genuine,"" Cowher said. ""They all were uniquely different, but they all were very good teachers. They all had an ability to communicate with everybody on the team and they had a good pulse for their team.""""He wasn't trying to go in there and mimic Chuck Noll,"" said Gailey. ""He was going in there to be Bill Cowher.""""You have to be yourself,"" Cowher said. ""When you're standing up in front of people and you start talking about things that don't really resonate with you, I think players are very perceptive.""The Steelers responded to Cowher by posting an 11-5 record and won the AFC Central Division before losing to the Buffalo Bills in the first round of the playoffs.Right from the start, Foster recalled, Cowher ""worked hard to create togetherness.""""Win as a team, lose as a team and be there for one another,"" Foster added, ""and like Bill Cowher used to always tell us, `Don't get too high with the highs and don't get too low with lows, but keep an even keel. Be consistent.' ""Cowher built on that first year to become only the second coach in NFL history to lead his team to the playoffs in his first six seasons.""A coach's job every year is to manage expectations,"" Cowher said. ""Obviously you're measured by wins and losses, but to me also it's: What direction is your team going? Are they growing as a team? Are the expectations becoming a little bit higher? That is the job of the coach, to understand each team and to have a plan in place where you can continue to grow, but do it with having sustainability.""From 1998-2000 the Steelers missed the playoffs and had losing records in the first two years of that slide. Cowher says understanding the pulse of a team might require a coach to be different in some ways year to year.""I'm going to treat a veteran team a lot differently than if I have a young team that's coming off a disappointing year,"" he said. ""I need to re-create a degree of confidence, a degree of toughness, a degree of disciple that may be different from when I had a team that was 15-1 or one coming off a championship season.""The 2004 Steelers were 15-1 but lost in the Conference Championship game to the 14-2 New England Patriots, who went on to win the Super Bowl.Cowher had higher expectations for his 2005 Steelers and was more demanding. The team went 11-5 and qualified for the playoffs as a wild-card team. That Steeler team then won three road games to get to and win Super Bowl XL.Cowher was a hallmark of consistency during his career and with his approach.""The naysayers will be out there, but you got to work,"" he says. ""It's not going to come overnight. You're not going to be measured by how many times you get knocked down; you're going to be measured by how many times you get back up.""Coached Pittsburgh Steelers from 1992-2006, for a record as an NFL head coach of 149-90-1 in regular-season play, a .623 winning percentage. Led the Steelers to the playoffs 10 times and won Super Bowl XL.Overcame: The challenge of replacing a legendary coach and created his own winning legacy.Lesson: Focus on who you are and what you believe in.""I tried to get my players feel comfortable, to feel confident, to take ownership in the locker room, to walk onto the field with a swagger, but also to have a great respect for anything that you accomplish, great respect for the opponent, great respect for those that came before you.""MORE ABOUT LEADERS & SUCCESS:Coach Paul Brown Put His Name On Pro FootballBret Favre Passed The Test Of Life And Football On His Way To The TopFor Former Running Back Eddie George, It's About Forward ProgressVince Lombardi Injected Redskins With A Winning Fever

15,XL,"Natural Resources: Last week President Trump announced plans to make the U.S. not just energy independent, but a global energy powerhouse. Too bad everyone was hyperfocused on his tweets.On Thursday, Trump said he was ushering in a new energy policy that marked an end to decades of fretting about an alleged ""energy crisis"" brought on by supposed limited domestic supplies and an insatiable demand for fossil fuels.""We now know that was all a big, beautiful myth,"" Trump said in remarks at the Department of Energy. ""The truth is that we have near-limitless supplies of energy in our country.""Trump had already taken several steps toward unleashing domestic energy supplies, but he announced six more that he plans to take, including reviving nuclear energy, lifting barriers to building coal plants overseas, building more energy pipelines — including one into Mexico — increased natural gas exports, and creating a new offshore-leasing program.""The golden era of American energy is now underway,"" he said.If that sounds overly dramatic, it isn't. Recent developments in drilling technology have made vast domestic supplies of oil and natural gas available for production. That, combined with the country's abundance of coal, means the U.S. could be a net energy exporter in nine years.The impact of this on the economy — new jobs, lower energy costs — and on international relations — ending dependence on energy supplies from unstable and unfriendly regions — cannot be underestimated.Administration critics, naturally, are determined to downplay this announcement by saying — as both Reuters and CNBC put it, using exactly the same words — that Trump had simply ""re-branded efforts … set in motion during the previous presidential administration.""But the truth is that the difference between Trump and President Obama on energy could hardly be more stark.While Obama mouthed the words ""all of the above"" when describing his own energy policy, his administration did everything it could to thwart all sources of energy except unreliable and heavily subsidized wind and solar.Obama canceled the Keystone XL pipeline; put vast tracts of land and offshore areas off-limits to oil and gas development; denied a permit for a liquefied natural gas export terminal in Oregon; endlessly pushed for huge tax hikes on energy companies; called oil the ""energy of the past""; and tried to kill coal with his ""Clean Power Plan."" Nuclear power was at a standstill. Even hydropower production dropped 7% on his watch.It is true that oil and natural gas production took off while Obama was in the White House, but this was despite Obama's best efforts, not because of them, since those production gains were on private lands.Trump's ""make American energy great again"" approach is a nightmare to environmentalists, who endlessly preach global-warming doom and fantasize about a world powered by windmills and solar panels.America is truly blessed with an incredible abundance of natural resources, and Trump is right to put the fortunes of today's Americans ahead of supposed climate change threats that won't materialize — if they do at all — for another 100 years.Getting the government out of the way of these resources is the best energy policy anyone could hope for, and it's the one Trump is pushing. If only the public, and the news media, would take notice.RELATED:Making American Energy Great AgainTrump's Energy Revolution Can't Come Soon EnoughEnviros Freak Over Trump's Climate Change Order, But Will Earth Notice?By Leaving Paris Climate-Change Deal, Trump Will Do U.S. Economy A 'Yuuuge' Favor

17,XL,"Substance and style — it's easy to get them confused or mistake one for the other. And they're never entirely unconnected, though exactly how much so is a matter of debate.That's especially true when it comes to evaluating Donald Trump's performance — a word particularly ambiguous in his case, as referring to either oratorical style or policy substance.The new president's detractors see a would-be autocrat threatening freedom of the press (""dishonest media"") and the independence of the judiciary (""so-called judge""). They see a barefaced liar or fantasist who maintains that his 306 electoral votes (two of which were cast for others) were more than George H.W. Bush's 426 in 1988, Bill Clinton's 379 in 1996 and Barack Obama's 365 in 2008.But the detractors' case can be overstated — and often has been in the press, much of which seems bent on validating Trump's news conference statement that ""the press has become so dishonest."" They pooh-poohed his misleading reference to immigrant violence in Sweden, only to learn, from rioting just a few nights later, that it's a real thing.The press expects that Trump's denunciation of leaks is the preliminary to a government crackdown on free speech. But so far, there has been nothing like the Obama administration's subpoena of New York Times reporter James Risen, its naming Fox News' James Rosen as an unindicted co-conspirator in another case and its prosecution of more leakers under the Espionage Act of 1917 than all previous administrations combined.In substance, Trump's administration has accomplished quite a lot in five weeks. It overturned a passel of Obama administration executive orders issued on the falsifiable and now falsified assumption that Democrats would hold the White House indefinitely.The Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines are now headed for approval, and the Environmental Protection Agency's Clean Power Plan and Waters of the United States mega-regulations are on the way out. Federal hiring is frozen, and two old regulations must be rescinded for each new one issued. The result has been some major changes in policy, as promised during the campaign — the way the political process is supposed to work.The executive order blocking travelers from seven predominantly Muslim countries has been blocked by a federal appeals court decision — labeled ""totally unconvincing"" by former New York top court judge and Trump critic Robert Smith — which the administration has meekly obeyed. A rewrite is being prepared.Meanwhile, this week's executive order enforcing existing immigration laws that the Obama administration refused to enforce (""prosecutorial discretion"") seems likely to deter future illegal entries. And it may well incentivize people who are already here illegally to, in Mitt Romney's phrase, ""self-deport"" as state legislation in Arizona has done over the past decade.Trump critics have pointed out, accurately, that immigration from south of the border has slowed since the 2008 financial collapse. The Trump enforcement strategy seems likely to slow it further, in a way that could falsify predictions of a majority-minority population by 2040 or so.That's consequential, whether you think it's a good thing or not. And it's probably what Trump voters hoped their candidate would accomplish.Consider also the Trump record on appointments. The press is full of articles about the number of important positions still unfilled. True enough — and true also of the early Obama, Bush and Clinton administrations. It's an inevitable result of the detailed disclosure requirements and Senate confirmation process required by statute.
"
18,XL,"And there have been headlines after the firing, only 24 days into the job, of national security advisor Michael Flynn.But some of Trump's appointments have been clearly first-rate. Defense Secretary James Mattis and new national security advisor H.R. McMaster not only bring records of impressive accomplishments as military leaders and thinkers but also have shown a steady willingness to speak truth to power.Then there's Judge Neil Gorsuch, who appears certain to be confirmed for the Supreme Court. In his engagingly written opinions as an appeals court judge, he has shown an openness to arguments from all ideological sides and to qualms about an ever-expanding administrative state.These are not the kind of people you would appoint to the highest positions if you aspired to impose authoritarian rule over a free people.Nor are they people you'd appoint if you wanted to abjure alliance commitments or kick sand in the faces of allies. Trump has had amicable and constructive meetings with the elected leaders of Britain, Japan and Canada and has argued with Mexico's leader not to argue in public about the wall.So whatever you think of the style, you have to admit there's significant substance there.RELATED:Trump News & Tweets

Lo and behold, they discovered that it's getting a lot done.""Trump Has Quietly Accomplished More Than It Appears"" reads the headline in the Atlantic.""With the Trump administration's chaos sucking up all the attention,"" the article begins, ""it's been able to move forward on a range of its priorities.... It is remaking the justice system, rewriting environmental rules, overhauling public-lands administration, and greenlighting major infrastructure projects. It is appointing figures who will guarantee the triumph of its ideological vision for decades to come.""It goes on to detail these achievements, many of which we've highlighted on these pages.Border crossings, for example, have plummeted, even though all Trump has done so far is promise to enforce existing laws.The Supreme Court approved parts of Trump's travel ban, a success made possible by Trump's appointment of Neil Gorsuch to the bench.Trump is busy filling lower court positions with conservative justices. Ron Klain, a White House aide to Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, said that Trump ""is proving wildly successful in one respect: naming youthful conservative nominees to the federal bench in record-setting numbers.""What else? Well, Trump pulled out of the Paris climate change deal, which as we noted in this space is a yuuuge win for the economy.The EPA, meanwhile, is dismantling Obama's coal-killing, growth-choking Clean Power Plan, and draining the heavy-handed Waters of the United States rule. When a veteran EPA official resigned this week, she complained in a letter to her former colleagues that ""the new EPA Administrator already has repeals of 30 rules under consideration,"" which the New York Times described as ""a regulatory rollback larger in scope than any other over so short a time in the agency's 47-year history.""Trump promised to kill two regulations for every new one enacted, but in his first six months the ratio was 16-to-1.Trump also approved the Keystone XL and other pipeline projects held up by Obama. He's also rolled back a ban on coal mining on public lands.To be sure, Trump hasn't scored a major legislative achievement on signature issues like ObamaCare and tax reform.The Atlantic writer describes the administration's achievements as something akin to a shadow government. But these actions aren't in the shadows. They're just being ignored by a media that is obsessed with digging up dirt on Trump.RELATED:Trump Approval Hits New Low As Support From His Base Slips: IBD/TIPP PollHow Can We Make America's Economy Great Again?

They argue that the available data prove fuel mandates have helped Americans wean themselves off foreign energy sources.However, these charts — which only show correlation, not causation — are highly misleading.The United States consumes about 19.6 million barrels of oil per day. Globally, 96 million barrels of oil are consumed daily, or about 35 billion barrels per year. When one considers that there are 42 gallons in every barrel, the record-setting 14.7 billion gallons of ethanol produced in 2015 amounts to only 350 million barrels of ethanol. This is only about 18 days' worth of oil-based fuel consumption in the United States, or 1% of annual world oil consumption.It is true that net crude oil imports have been cut in half over the past several years, but this is because hydraulic fracturing, commonly called ""fracking,"" has nearly doubled U.S. oil production since 2008. America's growing energy independence is not due to ethanol mandates.Officials at the Energy Information Administration estimate that America could be totally energy independent by 2026, but should this occur, it will be because of U.S. oil and natural gas development, not ethanol production.Not only has ethanol done little to help America become energy independent, it has also failed to reduce consumer costs at the pump. Ethanol is more expensive than gasoline, because a gallon of ethanol contains 33% less energy than a gallon of pure gasoline.The math looks something like this: An average gallon of gasoline costs $1.59 before state and federal taxes are added. A gallon of ethanol costs $1.49. On the surface, it appears that ethanol is cheaper, but because drivers get 33% fewer miles per gallon with ethanol than gasoline, their costs are actually higher. ($1.49x0.33= $.49. $1.49+$.49=$1.98).The ethanol mandate has also driven up the cost of doing business in farm country. Increased demand for corn caused prices of land, seed, and farm machinery to rise.For instance, in 2005, the average cost of rent for farmland in central Illinois was $147 per acre, but after seven years of the ethanol mandate that price has nearly doubled to $270 per acre.There is no dispute that the ethanol mandate provided a temporary stimulus to rural America, but it did so by diverting 40% of the nation's corn crop to fuel production. Corn growers have responded by producing more corn and, as a result, prices have fallen below the cost of production.Like all government programs, the ethanol mandate is subject to the law of diminishing returns. Corn producers need an ever-higher mandate to keep corn prices on an upward trajectory, but most cars can only run on fuel containing 10% ethanol.As a result, the ethanol mandate has been a double whammy for farmers who took out loans to buy equipment at artificially inflated prices. Now, they are left struggling to pay off their debts.The RFS is a failed experiment. It did not reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil or reduce consumers' costs, and it continues to distort grain markets and disrupt farmers' market-driven business model.The Trump administration has already taken action to streamline the permitting of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines. Next up on the list of things to do should be to phase out the ethanol mandate, ""making ethanol grain again.""
"
23,XL,"President Trump took steps to advance construction of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines, marking the start of an era with fewer constraints on the oil industry to the chagrin of environmentalists who have bitterly fought the projects.The moves, among Trump's first actions since taking office, are a major departure from the Obama administration, which rejected TransCanada's Keystone proposal in 2015 and has kept Dakota Access blocked since September. Environmentalists, concerned about climate change and damage to waters, land and Native-American cultural sites, now face an executive branch that's less sympathetic to their efforts. For the oil industry, it heralds more freedom to expand infrastructure and ease transportation bottlenecks.""We are going to renegotiate some of the terms,"" Trump told reporters today in the Oval Office as he signed the two measures. ""We will build our own pipelines we will build our own pipes.""Foreshadowing Trump's plans, the president told U.S. auto executives at a White House meeting Tuesday morning: ""We're going to make the process much more simple for the oil companies and everybody else that wants to do business in the United States.""TransCanada (TRP) climbed 3.7% to 48.92 in afternoon trade on the stock market today. Energy Transfer Equity (ETE) and Energy Transfer Partners (ETP), the developers of the Dakota project, climbed 3% and 4%, respectively.TransCanada had no immediate comment on the president's actions before they were announced, and Energy Transfer didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. A spokeswoman for the Standing Rock tribe that opposes the Dakota project says she would comment ""if it happens.""IBD'S TAKE: TransCanada is among five hot stocks soaring to new highs Tuesday.White House press secretary Sean Spicer on Monday said both Dakota Access and Keystone are examples of projects that would ""increase jobs, increase economic growth, and tap into America's energy supply more."" He said Trump wanted to balance environmental protection with activity that can grow jobs and the economy.It wasn't immediately clear what mechanism the documents Trump signed today would take. But his advisers have urged the new president to direct the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to grant an easement that would allow construction of the final portion of Dakota Access, reversing the Obama administration's conclusion that more environmental scrutiny was needed.The advisers had also urged the president to pave the way for Keystone XL by rescinding a 49-year-old directive from former President Lyndon B. Johnson that assigned the State Department responsibility for determining whether proposed cross-border energy projects serve the ""national interest.""TransCanada may need to submit another formal application to build the pipeline. The company's plans for Keystone XL already have been vetted, with years of environmental scrutiny culminating in Obama's 2015 decision that the pipeline was not in the U.S. interest.TransCanada has not said it would reapply for permission to build the pipeline, but the day after Trump's election, the Calgary-based company said it was looking for ways to convince the new administration of the project's benefits to the U.S. economy. The company has previously said it remains ""committed to Keystone XL.""Environmentalists fiercely battled the project, making it a flashpoint in broader debates about U.S. energy policy and climate change. Landowners in the pipeline's path warned that a spill of dense crude could contaminate the Ogallala aquifer, a source of drinking water that stretches from Texas to South Dakota. And activists said it would promote further development of oil sands in Alberta, Canada that generally require more energy to extract.Dakota Access opponents say the pipeline would damage sites culturally significant to Native Americans and pose an environmental hazard where it crosses the Missouri River. Earlier this month, the Department of the Army withheld the final easement necessary for construction beneath the lake.Energy Transfer has argued it went through the full permitting process and has the necessary approvals. The company has said the line will be in service in the first quarter of this year, a delay from its original expectations that Dakota Access would be operational by the end of 2016.Swift approval of Dakota Access could reinvigorate the sometimes violent protests at the site of the proposed construction. Environmental activists vowed to continue battling both projects.""A powerful alliance of indigenous communities, ranchers, farmers, and climate activists stopped the Keystone pipeline the first time, and the same alliance will come together to stop Keystone again if Trump tries to raise it from the dead,"" said Travis Nichols, a spokesman with Greenpeace.Josh Nelson, the deputy political director of the CREDO activist group said the action would show Trump is ""in the pocket of big corporations and foreign oil interests.""""Fierce grassroots activism has stopped these pipelines over and over again,"" he said. ""CREDO will do everything in its power to stop the Dakota Access and Keystone XL pipelines, and keep dirty fossil fuels in the ground where they belong.""Pipeline supporters said a final easement for the project would illustrate Trump's commitment to building out energy infrastructure needed to ferry oil and gas around the U.S. Although Keystone XL would transport oil sands crude from Canada, some space on the line is slated to be filled by supplies from North Dakota's Bakken shale play.Dakota Access, likewise, is aimed at giving Bakken producers a new route to energy markets, allowing them to forgo more costly rail shipments that have been a backstop when existing pipes fill up. With a capacity of about 470,000 barrels a day, Dakota Access would ship about half of current Bakken crude production and enable producers to access Midwest and Gulf Coast markets.Craig Stevens, spokesman for the Midwest Alliance for Infrastructure Now said moves to advance Keystone XL and Dakota Access would be a ""positive development"" for ""our nation's resource development energy infrastructure as a whole.Energy Transfer owns the Dakota Access project with Phillips 66 (PSX) and Sunoco Logistics Partners (SXL). Marathon Petroleum (MPC) and Enbridge Energy Partners (ENB) announced a venture in August that would also take a minority stake in the pipeline.
"
24,XL,"President Donald Trump's decision to revive TransCanada's (TRP) Keystone XL pipeline may herald a new era of pipeline abundance for Canadian oil producers after years of bottlenecks, while lowering the discount on the region's crude.The U.S. president signed documents to advance the project Tuesday, more than a year after his predecessor, Barack Obama, rejected it on grounds it would contribute to climate change. The decision follows the Canadian government's approval in November of Kinder Morgan's (KMI) Trans Mountain line to the Pacific and Enbridge's (ENB) expansion of Line 3 to the U.S. Midwest.The three lines would add 1.8 million barrels a day of crude export capacity, enough to handle Western Canada's growing oil production for 20 years, according to National Energy Board projections.That would add more than $4 billion a year to Western Canada's economy by making the region's crude more valuable relative to other grades, Tim Pickering, founder and chief investment officer of Auspice Capital Advisors Ltd. in Calgary, said in a phone interview. Because of the lack of capacity, refiners haven't paid as much for Canadian crude.""Too much capacity is not a big concern for the Canadian marketplace and producers right now,"" Pickering said. ""It gives us room down the road to increase production.""Canadian oil producers such as Suncor Energy (SU), Cenovus Energy (CVE) and Imperial Oil (IMO) have sold their heavy crude at discounts to West Texas Intermediate futures of as much as $40 a barrel in recent years amid constraints in pipeline space. Western Canadian Select's discount to West Texas Intermediate crude averaged about $14 a barrel over the past year, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That may shrink to $5 to $7 a barrel should all three lines get built, Pickering said.More pipelines from Canada would also ""generate greater competition for crudes of comparable quality such as those imported from Mexico or Venezuela,"" Harry Tchilinguirian, head of commodity-markets strategy at BNP Paribas in London, said in an instant message.The administration moved to expedite approval and construction of the Keystone XL pipeline as well as the Dakota Access line through North Dakota. Trump said he wanted to renegotiate terms to get a better deal for the U.S., including more U.S.-made materials in the lines.The 830,000-barrel-a-day Keystone XL has been blocked since it was first proposed in 2008. TransCanada said in a statement it will reapply for the project.The approval of Keystone XL and other lines ""will mean better netbacks to producers,"" Tim McMillan, chief executive officer of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, said in a phone interview Tuesday. ""It's really just a more efficient system for our economy.""Kinder Morgan's TransMountain line and Enbridge's Line 3 are scheduled for completion by the end of the decade, both companies have said. TransCanada also plans to build the Energy East line from Alberta to the Atlantic Coast.The pipelines may be more than the industry needs, according to Wood Mackenzie.""While we forecast continued growth in Canadian oil production; there might be too much pipe if Trans Mountain Expansion and Line 3 Replacement (approved in Nov 2016) and Keystone XL all start up by 2020,"" according to a note Tuesday from analyst Afolabi Ogunnaike. ""At best we would expect TransCanada to build Keystone XL or Energy East but not both.""Trans Mountain, which still faces at least two legal challenges, has the added advantage of opening up access to Asian markets for Canadian crude. Canada now sells nearly all its oil to the U.S.""Our view has been first of all that we need to diversify our markets, we can't rely on one market and one market only,"" Alberta Premier Rachel Notley told reporters in Edmonton on Tuesday.TransCanada has declined to comment on the timing of construction. In a best-case scenario, work could start this year, Dennis McConaghy, former executive vice president of corporate development at the company and a current shareholder, said by phone.
"
25,XL,"A few years back, in one of his finest moments, Sen. John McCain said on a Sunday talk show, ""Russia is a gas station masquerading as a country."" It was right when he said it, and it's even more right today.Russian President Vladimir Putin's circle of corrupt oligarchs gouge whatever money they can from the impoverished Russian economy and move it to bank accounts overseas. And they do this after giving Putin his cut, which he apparently also sends overseas.Many say Putin is the richest man in Russia, worth billions and billions. So the old Soviet model of nomenklatura communist bureaucrats getting rich while the rest of the country declines is still in place.But with energy prices falling, Putin's Russia has essentially been in a recession over the past four years. With oil at $50 a barrel or less, Russian budgets plunge deeper into debt. It's even doubtful the Russians have enough money to upgrade their military-energy industrial complex.Through crafty media relations and his own bravado, a deluded Putin struggles to maintain the illusion that Russia is a strong economic power. But it ain't so. Not even close.Now, Russia still has a lot of oil and gas reserves. And it uses this to bully Eastern and Western Europe. It threatens to cut off these resources if Europe dares to complain about Putin power grabs in Crimea, eastern Ukraine, the Baltics and elsewhere.But enter President  Trump. In his brilliant speech in Warsaw, Poland, earlier this week, he called Putin's energy bluff.It may well have been the best speech of his young presidency. Trump delivered a stirring leadership message, emphasizing the importance of God, freedom, strong families and democratic values.And while unambiguously pledging to uphold NATO's Article 5 — which commits the members to protect one another — Trump went even deeper. ""The fundamental question of our time is whether the West has the will to survive,"" he said. ""Do we have the confidence in our values to defend them at any cost? ... if we do not have strong families and strong values, then we will be weak and we will not survive."" He also spoke several times of the religious leadership and bravery of Pope John Paul II.It was a bold strike for the West.But in an absolutely key part of the speech, he took direct aim at Putin's energy bullying.Trump said, ""we are committed to securing your access to alternate sources of energy, so Poland and its neighbors are never again held hostage to a single supplier of energy.""President Trump has quickly made it clear that former President Barack Obama's war on business is over. He's also made it clear, through regulatory rollbacks of breathtaking scope, that the Obama war on fossil fuels is over.Trump wants America to achieve energy dominance. He withdrew from the costly Paris climate accord, which would have severely damaged the American economy. He directed the EPA to rescind the Obama Clean Power Plan, which would have led to skyrocketing electricity rates. He fast-tracked the Keystone XL pipeline. He reopened the door for a modernized American coal industry. He's overturning all the Obama obstacles to hydraulic fracturing, which his presidential opponent Hillary Clinton would have dramatically increased. And he has opened the floodgates wide to energy exports.Right now, U.S. oil reserves are almost in parity with those of Saudi Arabia. We have the second most coal reserves in the world. There are enough U.S. gas reserves to last us about a century. We have already passed Russia as the world's top natural gas producer. We are the world's top producer of oil and petroleum hydrocarbons. And exports of liquefied national gas are surging, with the Department of Energy rapidly approving new LNG projects and other export terminals.All these America-first energy policies are huge economic-growth and high-wage job producers at home. But in the Warsaw speech, Trump made it clear that America's energy dominance will be used to help our friends across Europe. No longer will our allies have to rely on Russia's Gazprom supplies with inflated, prosperity-killing prices.In short, with the free market policies he's putting in place in America's energy sector and throughout the U.S. economy, the business man president fully intends to destroy Russia's energy-market share. And as that takes hold, Russia's gas station economy will sink further.And as that takes hold, Bully-boy Putin will have to think twice about Ukraine, Poland and the Baltics. He'll have to think twice about his anti-American policies in the Middle East and North Korea. And he'll have to think twice about his increasingly precarious position as the modern-day Russian tsar.And the world may yet become a safer place.Trump has Putin over a barrel. RELATED:Why Can't The U.S. Defend Against A North Korea Nuke Attack?

26,XL,"With near unanimity, my never-Trump friends confess a sense of relief. It could have been worse. They thought it would be worse. A deep apprehension still endures but the international order remains intact, the republic still stands, and no ""enemy of the people"" has (yet) been arrested.Admittedly, this is a low bar. And this is not to deny the insanity, incoherence and sheer weirdness emanating daily from the White House, with which we've all come up with our own coping technique. Here's mine: I simply view President Trump as the Wizard of Oz.Loud and bombastic. A charlatan. Nothing behind the screen — other than the institutional chaos that defines his White House and the psychic chaos that governs his ever-changing mind. What to do? Ignore what's behind the curtain. Deal with what comes out in front: the policy, the pronouncements, the actions.And so far they hang together enough — Neil Gorsuch, Keystone XL, NATO reassurances, Syria strike, Cabinet appointments — that one can begin to talk plausibly about the normalization of this presidency.Hence the relief. But there are limitations to the Wizard of Oz approach. Some things do extrude from behind the curtain that are hard to ignore. And here I am not counting the gratuitous idiocies that can, despite their entertainment value, be safely ignored — for example, Trump's puzzlement as to why the Civil War was not avoided and how Andrew Jackson, who'd been dead 16 years, was so upset by its outbreak.These are embarrassments, but they don't materially affect the course of his presidency or of the country. Some weirdnesses, however, do.Such as, Trump's late-April pronouncements on South Korea. Being less entertaining, they were vastly underreported. Here's the context:Trump is orchestrating a worldwide campaign to pressure North Korea on its nukes and missiles. He dispatches (finally) the USS Carl Vinson strike group to Korean waters and raises the possibility of a ""major, major conflict"" with Pyongyang. Meanwhile, we are working furiously to complete a THAAD anti-missile system in South Korea to intercept North Korean rockets.
"
27,XL,"At which point, out of the blue, Trump tells Reuters that Seoul will have to pay for the THAAD system. And by the way, that 5-year-old U.S.-South Korea free trade agreement is a disaster and needs to be torn up.Now, South Korea is in the middle of a highly charged presidential campaign. The pro-American president was recently impeached and is now under indictment. The opposition party is ahead. It is wary of the U.S., accommodating to North Korea and highly negative about installing that THAAD system on its soil.We had agreed with Seoul that they would provide the land and the infrastructure, and we would pay the $1 billion cost. Without warning, Trump reneges on the deal, saying South Korea will have to foot the bill. This stirs anti-American feeling and gives opposition candidate Moon Jae-in the perfect campaign issue.What is it with this president insisting that other people pay for things we want? And for what? In a $4 trillion budget, $1 billion is a rounding error.
"
28,XL,"So self-defeating was the idea that within three days, national security adviser H.R. McMaster had to walk it all back, assuring the South Koreans that we would indeed honor our agreement and send no $1 billion invoice.But the damage was done. Moon's campaign feasted. The pro-American party was thrown on its heels. And the very future of THAAD — and a continued united front against Pyongyang under a likely Moon administration — is in doubt.As for the trade deal, the installation of THAAD has so angered China that it has already initiated an economic squeeze on South Korea. To which Trump would add a trade rupture with the United States.The South Korean blunder reinforces lingering fears about Trump. Especially because it was an unforced error. What happens in an externally caused crisis? Then, there is no hiding, no guardrails, no cushioning. It's the wisdom and understanding of one man versus whatever the world has thrown up against us. However normalized this presidency may be day to day, in such a moment all bets are off.What happens when the red phone rings at 3 in the morning?I'd say: Let it ring. Let the wizard sleep. Forward the call to Defense Secretary Mattis.
"
29,XL,"Yesterday's conventional wisdom: A wave of insurgent populism is sweeping the West, threatening its foundational institutions — the European Union, the Western alliance, even liberal democracy itself.Today's conventional wisdom (post-first-round French presidential election): The populist wave has crested, soon to abate.Chances are that both verdicts are wrong. The anti-establishment sentiment that gave us Brexit, then Donald Trump, then seemed poised to give us Marine Le Pen, has indeed plateaued. But although she will likely be defeated in the second round, victory by the leading centrist, Emmanuel Macron, would hardly constitute an establishment triumph.Macron barely edged out a Cro-Magnon communist (Jean-Luc Melenchon), a blood-and-soil nationalist (Le Pen) and a center-right candidate brought low by charges of nepotism and corruption (Francois Fillon). And the ruling Socialist candidate came in fifth, garnering a pathetic 6% of the vote.On the other hand, the populists can hardly be encouraged by what has followed Brexit and Trump: Dutch elections, where the nationalist Geert Wilders faded toward the end and came nowhere near power; Austrian elections, where another nationalist challenge was turned back; and upcoming German elections, where polls indicate that the far-right nationalists are at barely 10% and slipping. And, of course, France.In retrospect, the populist panic may have been overblown. Regarding Brexit, for example, the shock exaggerated its meaning. Because it was so unexpected, it became a sensation. But in the longer view, Britain has always been deeply ambivalent about Europe, going back at least to Henry VIII and his break with Rome. In the intervening 500 years, Britain has generally seen itself as less a part of Europe than an offshore island.The true historical anomaly was Britain's EU membership with all the attendant transfer of sovereignty from Westminster to Brussels. Brexit was a rather brutal return to the extra-European norm, but the norm it is.The other notable populist victory, the triumph of Trump, has also turned out to be less than meets the eye. He certainly ran as a populist and won as a populist but, a mere 100 days in, he is governing as a traditionalist.The ObamaCare replacement proposals are traditional small-government fixes. His tax reform is a follow-on to Reagan's from 1986. His Supreme Court pick is a straight-laced, constitutional conservative out of central casting. And his more notable executive orders read as a wish list of traditional business-oriented conservatism from regulatory reform to the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines.I happen to support all of these moves, but they don't qualify as insurrectionist populism. The one exception may be trade policy. As of now, however, it remains ad hoc and idiosyncratic. Trump has made gestures and threats to those cunning Mexicans, Chinese and now Canadians. But it's not yet clear if he is serious about, say, withdrawing from NAFTA or just engaging in a series of opening negotiating gambits.The softwood timber dispute with Canada is hardly new. It dates back 35 years. Every intervening administration has contested the terms of trade in various forums. A full-scale trade war with our leading trading partner would indeed break new ground. Anything short of that, however, is the art of the deal.The normalization of Trump is one indicator that there may be less to the populist insurrection than imagined. The key, however, is Europe, where the stakes are infinitely higher. There the issue is the future of the nation state itself, as centuries of sovereignty dissolve within an expanding superstate. It influences every aspect of daily life — from the ethnic makeup of neighborhoods to the currency that changes hands at the grocery.The news from France, where Macron is openly, indeed ostentatiously, pro-European (his campaign headquarters flies the EU flag) is that France is not quite prepared to give up on the great experiment. But the Europeanist elites had better not imagine this to be an enduring verdict. The populist revolt was a reaction to their reckless and anti-democratic push for even greater integration. The task today is to address the sources of Europe's economic stagnation and social alienation rather than blindly pursue the very drive that led to this precarious moment.If the populist threat turns out to have frightened the existing powers out of their arrogant complacency, it should be deemed a success. But make no mistake: The French election wasn't a victory for the status quo. It was a reprieve. For now, the populist wave is not in retreat. It's on pause.RELATED:Trump News & TweetsIBD Commentary and OpinionNever Mind Macron And Le Pen — Can Anyone Make France Great Again?
"
30,XL,"According to The New York Times, 10 moderates, 15 conservatives and eight other Republicans would have voted against the Republican bill to repeal and replace ObamaCare. So, then, 15 or so conservatives made it impossible to pass the bill favored by nearly every other Republican and President Donald Trump. If that is the case, what we have here is another conservative example of purism and principle ruining another major opportunity to do good.The first purist conservative example were the Never-Trumpers, who believed it was better for Hillary Clinton to be elected president and for the left to have four more years of presidential power than for Trump to win.There were valid reasons to wonder whether Trump was a conservative and valid reasons to oppose him in the primaries. There were no valid reasons to oppose him in the general election. I said all these things then and have thus far been validated beyond my wildest dreams.In terms of policy, Trump is a conservative dream. From appointing a conservative to the Supreme Court; to approving the Keystone XL pipeline; to weakening the fanatical, hysterical and tyrannical Environmental Protection Agency; to appointing an ambassador to the United Nations who has moral contempt for that immoral institution; to backing Israel; to seeking to reduce economy-choking regulations on business, all of which are essentially everything conservatives would wish for in a president, Donald Trump is almost too good to be true.But he's still not good enough for those conservatives who remain Never-Trumpers or the members of the House Freedom Caucus, at least with regard to the bill to repeal and replace ObamaCare that he worked so hard to have passed.It is quite possible that I and most other conservatives who supported the bill agree with just about every criticism of the bill that House conservatives made. But just as the question in the general election wasn't whether candidate Trump was our ideal, the question now wasn't whether the bill was our ideal. The question during the election was: What will happen if the Democrats and the left win the presidency again? And the question now is: What will happen if the Republicans don't pass a bill favored by all but about 30 Republican congressmen and, most importantly, by President Trump?But purists don't ask such questions. They live in a somewhat different world than the rest of us who actually agree with them on everything because we don't ask what is ideologically pure and true to our principles. We ask: What is closest to our ideology and our principles?Or, to put it another way, we have one larger principle than even the conservative principles we share with the purists: defeating the left because that is the No. 1 priority of those who cherish Western Civilization and regard America as the last best hope for humanity.The conservative Never-Trumpers and conservatives who voted for Trump had everything in common except for that overriding principle. Conservatives who voted for Trump believed that defeating the left is the overriding moral good of our time. We are certain that the left (not the traditional liberals) is destroying Western civilization. The external enemy of Western civilization is Islamists (the tens or perhaps hundreds of millions of Muslims who wish to see the world governed by sharia), and the internal enemy of the West is the left. What the left has done to universities and Western culture at the universities is a perfect example.Passing even a tepid first bill to begin the process of dismantling the crushing burden of ObamaCare would have been an important first step in weakening the left, not only by beginning to repeal ObamaCare but also by strengthening the Trump presidency and the president's ability to go forward with tax reform and other parts of his conservative agenda. The president is now damaged, and the Republican Party looks ludicrous — what other word can one use to describe the party that has voted more than 60 times in seven years to repeal ObamaCare and can't pass a bill to repeal or replace it when it is given the House, the Senate and the presidency?Make no mistake, ye of pure heart: This may well be the last time in your lifetimes that Republicans control both houses of Congress and have a conservative president. And understand that time is not on our side; there are congressional elections in a year and nine months.Providence or luck made it possible to have a conservative president. Act accordingly.And perhaps consider inscribing on the walls of your House and Senate offices a motto as relevant as In God We Trust — ""The Best Is the Enemy of the Better.""RELATED:Republicans Cave On ObamaCareSlow Slide Into Single-Payer Health CareWhere Did The Uninsured Go Under ObamaCare?

31,XL,"Politics: During the primaries and the presidential campaign, Donald Trump rarely described himself as a conservative. But his appointments and his initial actions as president have turned out to be as about as right wing as it gets.Trump over the years has earned a healthy amount of skepticism from conservatives, including from this page.National Review, in its editorial denouncing Trump early in the  primary season, called him ""a menace to American conservatism who would take the work of generations and trample it underfoot in behalf of a populism as heedless and crude as the Donald himself.""We asked at one point whether Trump was a ""common-sense conservative"" — as he described himself — or ""just mostly liberal."" When Trump secured the nomination, we argued that ""Republicans have managed to pick the least reliably conservative candidate out of a field that started with some of the most experienced, dedicated and successful conservatives ever to have thrown their hats into the ring.""But since winning the election, Trump has acted more conservative than Ronald Reagan.Consider the Cabinet Trump has assembled: school choice activist Betsy DeVos for Education, attorney general and EPA foe Scott Pruitt to head that agency, and former Texas governor Rick Perry to run Energy. Trump picked Tom Price, who had developed a detailed ObamaCare replacement plan, to run Health and Human Services, and Sen. Jeff Sessions, who gets a 94% lifetime rating from the American Conservative Union, as attorney general. Trump also named a staunch opponent of net neutrality to head the Federal Communications Commission.CNN described it as a ""conservative dream team of domestic Cabinet appointments that promises to move swiftly to dismantle the Obama administration's legacy in health care, education, labor and environmental policies.""Bill Bennett, who served as education secretary under Reagan, said ""these picks so far are not the most conservative by a Republican president since Reagan. They're the most conservative including Reagan. I was there. I sat around that table. I knew who those folks were.""Conservative favorite Ted Cruz summed it up by calling Trump's picks ""a team of all stars.""And when Trump whittled his list of Supreme Court justices down to three — Third Circuit judge Thomas Hardiman, Tenth Circuit judge Neil Gorsuch, and Eleventh Circuit judge William Pryor — conservatives were delighted with the choices.Meanwhile, his early actions as president have been making liberals' heads swim.In his first three full days in office, Trump has ordered a freeze on federal hiring and raises, moved to overturn President Obama's ban on the Keystone XL pipeline, talked about turning Medicaid into block grants and vowed to cut spending by $10 trillion. He's been prodding the GOP to come up with an ObamaCare replacement plan now, not put it off for two years as the Republican leadership had planned. He re-instituted Reagan's ban on U.S. aid to foreign organizations that perform abortions. And he told business leaders he wants to cut federal regulations by 75% or ""maybe more.""Not even Reagan was as bold as Trump has been in pushing a conservative agenda right out of the gate.Of course, this is Donald Trump we are talking about. It's possible that he's simply getting ready to make deals, and is merely offering an opening bid. ""Aim very high,"" is how he puts his deal-making strategy in his book ""Art of the Deal.""Also, we don't know what Trump has in mind for health care, spending on roads, and other areas that will reveal his governing style. We are suspicious of his anti-trade rhetoric and his interventionist instincts at home, even if they are labeled ""pro-worker."" (Reagan, it's worth noting, regularly made decisions that rankled his conservative base.)But it's also possible that the ferocious attacks coming from Democrats, the liberal media and the ""Never Trump"" crowd (i.e., moderate to liberal establishment Republicans) are pushing Trump further to the right. Out of spite if nothing else.If that's the case, then we hope Trump's critics keep it up.

32,XL,"U.S. stocks rose the most in three weeks, sending the S&P 500 Index to an all-time high, while Treasuries tumbled as investors resumed bets that growth in the world's largest economy is set to accelerate. Commodities rallied.The Nasdaq Composite Index also climbed to a record, with materials producers leading gains as copper and aluminum advanced. Housing stocks surged after the largest U.S. builder delivered earnings, while engineering firms gained as President Trump took steps to advance construction of oil pipelines. Banks jumped as the yield on the 10-year Treasury note climbed back above 2.45%. Crude topped $53 a barrel.Politics continued to sway financial markets as a U.K. court ruled that parliament must vote on any Brexit plan. And Donald Trump sought to cajole U.S. automakers to build plants in America and vowed to renegotiate the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines. Investors also turned to a slate of corporate earnings that began to show signs that the economy was on firm footing at the end of 2016. D.R. Horton's (DHI) results come amid data showing rising home construction and a pickup in demand as mortgage rates start to climb. The first reading on last quarter's U.S. economic output is due Friday.The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose four basis points to 2.43% as of 10:16 a.m. in New York. Tuesday's $26 billion two-year U.S. note sale drew a yield of 1.21%, above the level indicated before the auction.

34,XL,"Oil gains eased in New York after an industry report said U.S. crude and fuel stockpiles climbed last week.Crude supplies rose 2.93 million barrels, the American Petroleum Institute was said to report. Futures lost about 27 cents per barrel from the close after the release of the data. Iraq has trimmed supply by 180,000 barrels a day and will cut a further 30,000 a day by the end of the month, Oil Minister Jabbar Al-Luaibi said. President Trump took steps to advance construction of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access oil pipelines while foreshadowing a ""renegotiation"" of terms.Oil has held above $50 a barrel since the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and 11 additional countries agreed late last year to curtail supply by about 1.8 million barrels a day. While Saudi Arabia says more than 80% of the targeted cut has been implemented since the deal took effect Jan. 1, Goldman Sachs warned Tuesday that prices above $60 will boost output, including from shale. U.S. drillers last week added the most oil rigs since 2013.""The market is having to filter a lot right now: Keystone, Trump and OPEC issues,"" Tim Pickering, founder and chief investment officer of Auspice Capital Advisors Ltd. in Calgary, said by phone. ""OPEC adherence appears to be a lot better than anticipated.""West Texas intermediate crude for March delivery rose 43 cents, or 0.8%, to settle at $53.18 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It was the highest close for a front-month contract since Jan. 6. Total volume traded was about 13% below the 100-day average. WTI traded at $52.91 at 4:40 p.m. in New York after the API report.Brent for March settlement climbed 21 cents, or 0.4%, to $55.44 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange, closing at a $2.26 premium to WTI.Gasoline inventories increased 4.85 million barrels in the week ended Jan. 20, according to people familiar with the API data. Stockpiles of distillate fuel, a category that includes heating oil and diesel, rose 1.95 million.Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg project that the Energy Information Administration will report on Wednesday that U.S. crude stockpiles rose by 2.5 million barrels last week.TransCanada's Keystone pipeline was rejected under former President Obama, and Energy Transfer Partners LP's $3.8 billion Dakota Access project was stalled when the Obama administration halted work on land near Lake Oahe in North Dakota amid protests by Native American groups.""It's the oil industry's turn to be in Trump's barrel,"" John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital LLC, a New York-based hedge fund that focuses on energy, said by phone. ""This isn't a surprise because these pipelines fit into his pro-industry, pro-infrastructure agenda.""In Iraq, OPEC's second-biggest producer, 90% of output cuts have come from oil companies run by the federal government. But Baghdad is also coordinating reductions with the semi-autonomous region of Kurdistan and international oil companies, Al-Luaibi said in London. It's too early to say if the cuts could be extended beyond the initially-agreed-upon six-month term, he said.

35,XL,"AK Steel (AKS) and Allegheny Technologies (ATI) reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings Tuesday, with Steel Dynamics (STLD) set to release results after the closing bell. Allegheny Tech stock flew, lifting U.S. Steel (X) and Nucor (NUE). But AK Steel erased early gains in an ugly reversal.AK Steel earned 25 cents a share excluding various items, down 17% vs. a year earlier but easily beating views for 6 cents. Sales fell 8% to $1.4186 billion, just exceeding forecasts for $1.41245 billion. Steel prices rose 7% to $998 a ton on a better sales mix and better carbon steel spot pricing.But AK Steels sees steel prices little changed in Q1 vs. Q4.Specialty steel producer Allegheny lost 4 cents a share, but that was better than views for an 11-cent loss and last year's 56-cent loss. Revenue rose 8% to $796.1 million, below views for $803.62 million. Allegheny also was relatively bullish about 2017.IBD'S TAKE: While steel and materials stocks have been leaders of the postelection rally, the big-cap tech ""FANG+"" stocks are all at or near buy zones, with Amazon and Facebook trying to break out.President Trump Tuesday morning signed executive orders approving the Keystone XL and Dakota pipelines, with a stipulation that the pipes should be made using U.S. steel.Allegheny spiked 31% to 22.28, busting out of a base at 19.30 to an 18-month high.AK Steel shot up as high as 10.26, retaking its 50-day moving average, and putting the stock back in buy range. But shares abruptly reversed on the stock market today, closing down 6.6% to 8.68.Other stocks traded off intraday peaks. U.S. Steel climbed 1.3% to 33.22, off session highs of 34.94 and closing below its 50-day line. Nucor rose 1.4%, failing to hold its 50-day. Steel Dynamics closed 2.1%, still above that key area.Steel Dynamics late Tuesday reported a 378% EPS gain to 43 cents, in line with views. Revenue climbed 20% to $1.91 billion vs. estimates for $1.875 billion. Steel Dynamics did not offer specific guidance in the 6 p.m. ET release, but was generally upbeat.""The company believes that current and anticipated macroeconomic and market conditions are in place to benefit the domestic steel industry in the coming year,"" said CEO Mark Millett.Shares were not active immediately after the release. Steel Dynamics will hold a conference call Wednesday morning.On Jan. 18, steel stocks rebounded from 50-day lines after Trump's Commerce Secretary nominee Wilbur Ross signaled he would support additional tariffs on Chinese steel. But the sector wiped out those gains on Thursday after Citigroup said the group's strong postelection rally had priced in most of the potential upside.RELATED:Steel Stocks Erase Wednesday's Trump Trade Gains; Citi Says Upside Priced InSteel Stocks Trigger Buy Points As Wilbur Ross Signals China Tariffs
"
36,XL,"Energy: With the swipe of a pen on Tuesday, President Trump will begin to erase the anti-energy legacy of the previous administration. It's one of the most important things he will do as president. And he's not done yet.Talk about ""repeal and replace."" By executive order, Trump will end the Environmental Protection Agency's war against cheap energy by reversing the Obama administration's burdensome and economically ruinous orders limiting carbon emissions from the nation's power plants.Announcing the changes on Sunday, new EPA chief Scott Pruitt made very clear that the Obama administration's Clean Power Plan, which mandated specific carbon emission targets for the states and which devastated the coal industry, is about to become null and void.""This is about making sure that we have a pro-growth and pro-environment approach to how we do regulation in this country,"" Pruitt told ABC's ""This Week,"" adding that the executive order and other actions seek to ""address the past administration's efforts to kill jobs across this country through the Clean Power Plan.""This joins a number of other recent actions by the Trump White House to give American energy producers the green light to discover and deliver massive new supplies of energy to the market, writing an end to the U.S.' dependence on politically questionable foreign energy sources.Last week, for instance, Trump approved the Keystone XL pipeline, which will ensure a continuing flow of millions of barrels of crude from Canada's oil-rich tar sands region.That, too, will help the economy by making more energy available while also creating thousands of well-paying jobs to build the pipeline and to maintain it.In his remarks, Pruitt also suggested that the U.S. will ignore the so-called Paris Agreement that seeks to limit carbon output by wealthier nations, in particular the U.S.Pruitt notes, rightly, that the free-market-driven fracking boom and clean coal technologies have put the U.S. at the forefront of reducing its carbon output. The U.S. didn't need the job-killing Paris deal to cut carbon emissions; it did it all by itself, without the aid or interference of capitalism-loathing climate change bureaucrats.U.S. energy-related CO2 emissions plunged from 6,001 million metric tons in 2007 to 5,259 million tons in 2015, a 12.4% decline. In the decade from 2005 to 2015, overall carbon intensity — a measure of how much energy it takes to produce a dollar of GDP — declined an average of 1.5% a year in the U.S.It is a major shift, thanks almost entirely to private energy producers — not government bureaucrats. We're cleaner and richer, a clear win-win.Now, with the Trump administration setting a new course on energy — and keeping a major promise he made during the campaign — his nomination of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court looms even larger.How so? The high court in early 2016 gave the EPA carte blanche in imposing painful economy-dampening regulations on the states — something that, on its face, appears to be plainly unconstitutional.But Gorsuch has in the past expressed his strong opposition to so-called ""Chevron deference,"" the doctrine named for a 1984 high-court case in which the justices gave extraordinary and sweeping rights to unelected bureaucrats to make laws. That 1984 case disenfranchised all Americans, even as it empowered left-leaning government officials who can't be fired or voted out of office.This unwarranted court decision, in essence, created a fourth branch of government outside of the three branches created by the Constitution.It's time to cut this leviathan down to size. And energy is a very good place to start. It is the lifeblood of all economic activity, and to attack energy is to attack the economy itself. That's why today's leftists, who hate capitalism, pose as ardent ""environmentalists.""It's one thing to propagate common-sense rules that keep the environment clean without bankrupting entire industries; quite another to turn the U.S. regulatory apparatus into an active enemy of a healthy economy and more jobs, which is precisely what President Obama did.Trump's energy deregulation will bear fruit for years to come. It won't get the attention that the health care fight did, but it's just as important.RELATED:Can Trump's Energy-Savvy Cabinet 'Make American Energy Great Again'?As He Leaves Office, Obama Makes A Last-Ditch Effort To Kill Fossil FuelsThe Rogue EPA's Shocking Disregard For The Law

37,XL,"Natural gas is making such a resurgence that some are calling it ""the product of the future,"" and Rice Midstream Partners (RMP) is evidence of that.The natural gas distributor is a master limited partnership formed by Rice Energy (RICE), one of several companies making a big bet on natural gas. Rice Energy owns more than 40% of the relatively young Rice Midstream.Unlike many companies of its kind, Rice Midstream concentrates almost exclusively on natural gas when it comes to transporting energy.""Rice Midstream is a pure play on gathering dry gas production and getting it to the market,"" said Tristan Richardson, an equity research analyst at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. ""Other midstream firms are diversified across wet gas and crude.""But Rice Midstream isn't the only sign energy companies are turning to natural gas for future revenue. BP (BP) has said it wants natural gas to make up 60% of its energy mix in the next 10 years.Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) Chief Executive Ben van Beurden said the liquefied natural gas market will grow four times faster than oil, and double in the next 15 years. Plus, Dow component Exxon Mobil (XOM) announced plans to build liquefied natural gas terminals in Texas and Louisiana.There are others who are joining the party in the same vein as Rice, with midstream companies founded by parent energy firms. They include Antero Resources' (AR) Antero Midstream (AM), EQT Corp.'s (EQT) EQT Midstream (EQM) and Cone Midstream (CNNX), which was formed by Consol Energy (CNX) and Noble Energy (NBL).The Oil & Gas-Transport/Pipeline group is ranked No. 84 out of the 197 industry groups that IBD tracks. Rice Midstream has a 92 Composite Rating, meaning it's outperforming 92% of stocks tracked by IBD. It's also on IBD's IPO leaders list.Rice Midstream debuted in December 2014 and is headquartered in Canonsburg, Pa., near the heart of the Marcellus shale oilfield in the state's Appalachian basin. That's where most of Rice Midstream's natural gas operations are.In addition to distributing natural gas, Rice Midstream supplies water for hydraulic fracturing, a key ingredient in the process. During ""fracking,"" water is injected into wells along with sand or another type of material to loosen the natural gas or oil trapped in the rocks.""The water business has tailwinds right now,"" said Brian Brungardt, a research analyst at Stifel. ""Every (exploration and production) operator continues to improve the well designs they are employing on the fracking side. Improvement largely means using more sand per well.""With more sand comes more water. Another improvement is longer laterals from each well, requiring more water.Of the midstream companies, only Antero and Rice supply water — and Rice stands out from Antero on that count as well.While Antero Midstream just services the needs of parent Antero Resources, Rice Midstream serves third-party customers like EQT, along with parent Rice Energy, its primary customer.Water accounts for 30% of Rice Midstream's operational revenue, but Richardson said the business will be a smaller piece of its operations in the next two to three years as Rice Midstream acquires more infrastructure for distributing natural gas, known as gathering.Midstream companies gather natural gas from wellheads in the field and then ship it along smaller pipelines to larger pipelines that carry gas across state borders.Rice Midstream's gathering volumes jumped 25.7% to 1.2 million cubic feet of natural gas in the fourth-quarter vs. the third quarter. Its Q4 gathering and compression revenue was up 25% to $41.8 million compared with Q3.IBD'S TAKE: Rice Midstream Partners holds a high IBD Composite Rating of 92, but it's not even the highest-ranked stock in its group. Tops on the list is Argentina's TGS (TGS). For more on that company, check here.Gathering volumes could increase even more this year as natural gas prices rise, spurring exploration and production firms to increase spending and drill more.In a January 2017 report outlining short-term production, the Energy Information Administration said it sees natural gas spot prices averaging $3.55 per million British thermal unit this year and $3.72 next year vs. an average of $2.51 in 2016.Rice Energy plans to boost 2017 net production by 59% vs. 2016 and raised its capital spending outlook to $1.035 billion for drilling and completion activity from $686 million in 2016.Even if natural gas prices fall, Rice Midstream will be shielded from commodity price fluctuations as Rice Energy is ""significantly hedged through 2017,"" said Stifel's Brungardt.But if prices were to drop and stay low for an extended period and Rice Energy scaled back production, then Rice Midstream's revenue results could take a hit on reduced volumes, according to SunTrust's Richardson.President Trump's election has given energy firms a boost as his energy policies are widely viewed as a plus for the industry as he promised to push back environmental regulations and allow drilling on federal lands.He also allowed construction on the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline to restart and said TransCanada should ""resubmit its application"" for the Keystone XL project President Obama rejected.But local politics could still inhibit drilling and pipeline expansion.""It appears the new administration early on is taking a more constructive view with various infrastructure projects, pipelines included,"" Brungardt said. ""But local opposition, that 'not in my backyard' mentality, certainly continues to be an issue.""But Richardson said the local regulatory environment has been more bullish as the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and state governments approved more pipelines in Appalachia in recent months, including the Williams' (WMB) Atlantic Sunrise pipeline and Energy Transfer Partners' (ETP) Rover pipeline.Brungardt has a hold rating on the stock due to valuation, but says Rice Midstream has a ""solid balance sheet."" Richardson has a buy rating on the stock.Shares of Rice slipped 1.3% to close at 24.92 Friday.RELATED:'Permania' Infects CERAWeek But Don't Count Out Bakken, Natural GasAnalysts Are Bullish On Fracking Supplier Antero Midstream

39,XL,"With Inauguration Day just around the corner, it is important to remember that every new administration brings changes.The incoming U.S. president has expressed skepticism about several international trade deals, including NAFTA. That's worrying to many Canadians. A poll conducted last November found that 57% of Canadians think the pact has made their economy better off (vs. just 20% who say it is worse off).There is also the open question of how well this new Republican administration and the Republican-controlled Congress will get along with Canada's still-young Liberal government. At least on the surface, President-elect Donald Trump and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau seem to be very different from one another.Yet there is cause to believe that the two countries on either side of the world's longest border will remain close in the coming years. Whatever difficulties threaten to strain relations — and there are always some — should be weathered reasonably well.Take the issue of NAFTA. While there are understandable fears regarding the prospect of reopening this trade deal, there is also the real possibility that doing so could lead to more free trade between our countries, not less. Contentious issues — like Canada's supply management for dairy and poultry, or U.S. tariffs on Canadian softwood lumber — might actually get resolved to the benefit of consumers on both sides of the border.Furthermore, Mr. Trump favors easier trade with Canada on at least one specific point: approval of the Keystone XL pipeline. Connecting Hardisty, Alberta, to Steele City, Neb., the 1,179-mile pipeline could transport up to 830,000 barrels of Canadian oil daily to Gulf Coast refineries. Thus far, however, this important project has been blocked by President Obama.Though many Americans do not realize it, Canadian oil still matters quite a great deal to the United States. It is true that technological advancements like horizontal drilling and fracking have allowed U.S. oil and natural gas producers to tap previously unreachable domestic resources, leading to a substantial drop in total oil imports.Nevertheless, Canada remains the top foreign oil supplier to the U.S. In fact, imports from Canada are up, thanks to the displacement of imports from other countries, the addition of new pipeline capacity, and more U.S. refinery space for heavy oils from Western Canada. In 2015, 40% of all oil imported by the U.S. came from its peaceful northern neighbor.Although Mexico is set to overtake Canada this year as the No. 2 exporter of goods to the U.S. (behind China), Canada remains the top export destination for 35 American states. It is also the number one supplier to the U.S. not just of crude oil, but also of refined petroleum products, natural gas and electricity. And it's a leading supplier of uranium, too.The fact is that our two countries have a long history of cooperation, even when our leaders and governments have hailed from opposite sides of the political spectrum.Through decade after decade of peaceful coexistence, the United States and Canada have been reliable allies in an uncertain world. They have fought side by side, too, to defend freedom around the world. Our nations' closeness derives from proximity, to be sure, and from a shared history as well.But more profoundly, what binds the two allies are shared values. Whatever our differences in this regard, they have always been far outweighed by our commonalities.Our two countries have long been beacons of freedom and progress in a world that still cannot take these for granted. Our two organizations, the Heritage Foundation and the Montreal Economic Institute, have always championed these core values. And we are confident, given all of the above, that the new administration in D.C. will work to uphold them as well, and to maintain the close relationship that persists between the land of the free to the south and the true north, strong and free.

40,XL,"Another day, another pipeline protest by ""keep it in the ground"" activists.On Dec. 8, a dozen people swarmed a construction site near the Hudson River in an attempt to halt construction of Spectra Energy's AIM pipeline, which is designed to carry natural gas from New Jersey to Massachusetts. The protesters, who call themselves the HudsonStand12, were arrested and charged with criminal trespass and resisting arrest by authorities in Cortlandt, New York.Those arrests come on the heels of the monthslong protests against the Dakota Access oil pipeline project in North Dakota, which, of course, followed the brouhaha over the Keystone XL pipeline.Climate activists are now hoping to block oil and gas pipeline projects across the country due to their claim that we must keep all hydrocarbons in the ground to avert catastrophic climate change. Those same activists repeatedly claim we don't need fossil fuels because we can rely solely on wind and solar energy.But while they obsess over our carbon footprint, climate activists don't give a fig about the land-use footprint of renewables. Indeed, the dirty truth about ""clean"" energy is that it requires shocking amounts of land. In a recent report for the Manhattan Institute, I show that using wind and solar energy to reduce domestic carbon dioxide emissions by 80% by 2050 (80 by 50) will require covering about 287,700 square miles of territory — an area about the size of Texas and West Virginia combined.I calculated the land-use requirements by examining three decarbonization scenarios that have been published over the past few years including the wind, water, and solar scenario that has been endorsed by the leaders of the Sierra Club, Greenpeace, and 350.org. Averaging those three scenarios shows that achieving 80 by 50 with renewables alone will require about 1,958 gigawatts of wind energy capacity and about 2,441 gigawatts of solar capacity.I then used data from the Department of Energy and published media stories to calculate wind energy's capacity density, that is, its overall footprint. The result: wind energy's footprint is 3 watts per square meter, or 1 gigawatt per 131.3 square miles. I relied on published data for three large California solar-photovoltaic projects to calculate solar's capacity density. The result: solar's footprint is 36.3 watts per square meter or 1 gigawatt per 10.6 square miles.These land-use figures are relevant because of the growing rural backlash against renewable-energy projects. For instance, while national media focused on protesters who gathered near Cannon Ball, North Dakota, to oppose Dakota Access, they ignored the recent rejection of a huge wind project located about 170 miles west of there.On Nov. 15, Billings County officials rejected the application for a 383-megawatt wind energy project that was to cover some 25,000 acres. Chief among their concerns was the project's visual impact, including the fact that some of the turbines would have been visible from inside Theodore Roosevelt National Park.In New York, three upstate counties — Erie, Orleans, and Niagara — as well as the towns of Yates and Somerset, are all fighting a proposed 200-megawatt project called Lighthouse Wind. In Vermont, about 160 towns and cities have signed the Rutland Resolution which calls for more local control over the siting of renewable-energy projects.Renewables are also hammering wildlife. Not only are wind turbines killing significant numbers of eagles and other birds, a recent study by scientists from the US Geological Survey have found that wind turbines are now the planet's largest killer of bats.For decades, a central tenet of environmentalism has been small footprints in everything from agriculture to urban planning. But now, in the name of climate change, environmentalism has been turned on its head. Rather than advocate for people, landscapes and wildlife, our biggest environmental groups are cheering for renewable energy schemes that disregard all three.In short, keeping it ""in the ground"" requires decimating much of what's above ground. That's a lousy trade.

41,XL,"The day after the presidential election the executive director of the Sierra Club glumly called the Donald Trump victory ""deeply disturbing for the nation and the planet."" Well, yes, if you're a climate change alarmist who hates fossil fuels, you're in for a bad four and maybe eight years.Greenpeace Executive Director Annie Leonard was even more apocalyptic, saying: ""I never thought I'd have to write this. The election of Donald Trump as President has been devastating. … There's no question, Donald Trump's climate denial is staggering. He wants to shut down the EPA, cancel the Paris Cimate Agreement, stop funding clean energy research and drill baby drill."" Ah, but if this is so crazy, why did he win?The short answer is that Americans went to the polls and rejected environmental extremism among other things. The biggest loser on election night was the Big Green movement in America dedicated to the anti-prosperity proposition that to save the planet from extinction we have to deindustrialize the U.S. and throw millions and millions of ‎our fellow citizens out of their jobs. Voters turned thumbs down on the climate change lobby and rightfully so.It may seem an exaggeration to say that the radical leftist green groups want to throw working class Americans out of their jobs — but it isn't. They openly admit it.The Sierra Club actually declared ""victory"" last year when it helped push several of America's leading coal production companies into bankruptcy.Sierra Club spokeswoman Lena Moffitt took credit for destroying coal production in America, but she neglected to mention the tens of thousands of miners, truckers, construction workers and other blue collar workers who lost their jobs due to the Sierra Club campaign. What humanitarians these people are!Ms. Moffitt promised that the Sierra Club will ""bring the same expertise that we brought to taking down the coal industry and coal-fired power in this country to taking on gas in the same way. … to ensure that we're moving to a 100% clean energy future.""Wait a minute. There are an estimated 10 million Americans who are directly or indirectly employed by the oil and gas and coal industries. The left wants to put every one of these people out of a job? Will they use Stalinistic worker relocation programs to pull this off?And by the way, someone might want to inform these self-proclaimed scientific geniuses that natural gas is clean energy.‎Fortunately, we learned on Election Day that voters aren't as alarmed as the alarmists are. Almost none of the voters that I met in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Indiana or Michigan had anything but contempt for the climate change fanatics. They view this as another attempt by Washington to run their lives and completely ignore their economic plight in favor of grandiose dreams of the government somehow changing the weather.In so many ways climate change was one of the primary issues that allowed Donald Trump to crash through the blue wall of the industrial Midwest. The Democrats' preposterous opposition to building the Keystone XL pipeline, which could create as many as 10,000 high-paying construction, welding, pipe fitting and electrician jobs, is emblematic of how the party that is supposed to represent union workers turned their backs on their own members and their families.The Paris climate-change treaty puts America last and forces us to stop using cheap, reliable and abundant domestic fossil fuels while the rest of the world — particularly China and India — are all-in on coal. Nobody in Washington seemed to notice that, as the Wall Street Journal reported last month, ""China's government said it would raise coal power capacity by as much as 20% by 2020, ensuring a continuing strong role for the commodity in the country's energy sector.""That's more than the entire energy usage of Canada in a year. Um, does this sound like a country that has any interest in cutting its carbon emissions? Amazing that the truck drivers in Indiana, and the coal workers in West Virginia, and the steel producers in Ohio get that the rest of the world is laughing at us, and the president of the United States doesn't.The surprise of this election is that Democrats were surprised by the mass voter rejection of the radical climate-change agenda. Every poll for the last five years, at least, has shown that climate change barely registers as a leading concern of American voters. Jobs and the economy were always issues Nos. 1 and 2, and global warming was usually close to last on the list.A 2015 Fox News poll found that only 3% of Americans believed that climate change was ""the most important issue facing America today.""That means 97% disagreed with Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders and Tom Steyer that global warming was the greatest threat to America. This didn't stop Hillary Clinton from telling West Virginians that she would put every coal miner out of a job. Then she wonders why she got crushed in this unionized, historically reliably Democratic state.The issue that now confronts Democrats is whether they can reconnect with blue collar union voters by disassociating themselves from the fanatical greens who are trying to destroy union blue-collar jobs. It won't be easy. Environmental groups are said to be raising record hauls of cash from their millionaire and billionaire donors since the election. Ultra-green environmentalists like Tom Steyer may call the party's tunes, but then don't be surprised when millions of blue collar middle-class workers flee to the Republicans.In the Democratic Party, something has to give. My prediction is that Democrats will only make a comeback in American politics when they throw the likes of crazies such as Tom Steyer, the Sierra Club, and Greenpeace off the bus and start listening to the everyday concerns of working class Americans again.

42,XL,"‎ Back in early 2015 oil and gas company ConocoPhillips requested a permit from the Obama administration to launch an oil drilling project in Alaska.The energy project, called the Greater Moose's Tooth Development, is located within the National Petroleum Reserve and ‎would create thousands of jobs in an economically depressed area of the state.The project has the full approval of the local community, and poses little threat to the environment in a sparsely populated region.It is a multi-billion dollar jobs and infrastructure project with roads and housing and pipelines. It won't cost the federal taxpayers a penny to build. In fact the royalties from the project will likely raise hundreds of millions of tax dollars for the federal government and the state.A no-brainer, right? Not exactly. For years the Obama administration has tangled up the project in regulatory red tape.""We are ready to break ground on day one after we get the permit,"" a frustrated Conoco-Phillips vice president John Dabbar tells me. ""We're going to employ nearly everyone up there,"" he adds.It still hasn't been approved because Obama hates fossil fuels.If Donald Trump is smart, he will green-light the drilling project the day he enters office.Now multiply this story by several hundred at least. The radical green agenda of the Obama regime has for eight years canceled, delayed, denounced and disrupted these types of smart energy, mineral and transportation projects all over the country.The value of these financially lucrative and job-creating initiatives — such as the Keystone XL pipeline — is in the hundreds of billions of dollars.Think about that in connection with Donald Trump's promise of as much as $1 trillion for new infrastructure spending. I am always asked, where will the money come from to pay for these projects given that the government is already running near trillion dollar annual deficits?We've all been looking at this the wrong way. Smart infrastructure investment in America doesn't require one penny of new federal spending. In fact these projects can substantially reduce government borrowing and increase revenue inflows.All President-elect Trump must do to unleash the mighty spending of private, for-profit enterprise is to give the companies and the localities the green light to build, to drill, to mine, to invest.A new study from the Committee to Unleash Prosperity, by Jackson Coleman, a former Interior Department energy expert, finds that the value of energy resources on federal lands could exceed $50 trillion. The federal leasing revenues and income tax receipts from developing these resources could reach $3 trillion.The Obama administration has held up at least five trans-national pipelines that could create tens of thousands of high paying union jobs.In the mountain states like Montana, Idaho and Wyoming, dozens of major mining projects for urgently-needed rare minerals have been bottled up by the federal regulators.  Apparently, Obama would rather import these from resources from China.Then there are coal plants necessary to secure our electric power supply. America desperately needs to build clean coal fire plants to ensure reliable electricity to our homes and businesses. Obama has shut them down while bankrupting the industry.We also need refineries and LNG terminals to allow America to export more of our abundant shale oil and gas. Since we have the cleanest oil, gas, and coal in the world, developing U.S. Energy is positive for the global environment and reducing greenhouse gases.There is one key distinction between private and public infrastructure spending. For-profit projects by definition must have a positive return on investment. Public infrastructure projects often have negative returns because they generate so little revenue.Think of the $70 billion bullet train in California that will carry very few passengers. Would any private company in its right mind ever build this rolling white elephant?  Or think about the Bridge to Nowhere in Alaska or the Obama ""investments"" in green energy projects that have gone belly up.Sure we need road and bridge and airport improvements. But that isn't what is holding back growth. We don't need more public works projects. We need more private investment.For seven years now the economy has severely underperformed because business capital investment — in factories, equipment, computers, tractors, warehouses, and laboratories — has dried up. That's the real infrastructure crisis in America.Trump can fix that capital infrastructure deficit by simply giving permits to the myriad bricks and mortar projects, like the Greater Moose's Tooth Development. In other words we can solve the infrastructure problem and lower the budget deficit at the same time.

43,XL,"President-elect Donald Trump's decision to nominate former Texas Governor Rick Perry to head the Department of Energy opens the door to U.S. energy independence in the near future — not to mention a growing economy, fueled by private-sector investment and high-paying jobs.In other words, a radical break from the past eight years of the Obama administration.Trump has outlined several steps he wants to take in energy policy. First, he has pledged to roll back the obstructionist regulatory efforts of the Environmental Protection Agency.  And no one will be better at achieving that goal than Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, who Trump picked to run the agency.For years now, Congress has been ceding tremendous power to federal agencies, and bureaucrats have gladly embraced that handover.  But under President Obama, several federal agencies decided to expand their legal mandate to an ideological mandate — and no agency more so than the EPA.  Look for Pruitt to rein in that agency and slap down its power grab.Second, the president-elect has promised to revisit the Keystone XL pipeline decision.Government environmental-impact studies cleared the pipeline to proceed. Waiting until voters could no longer express their disapproval at the polls, Obama finally decided to squash the infrastructure project — along with the thousands of high-paying jobs needed to build it.Similarly, the Dakota Access pipeline had received needed government approvals and was nearly complete when the Standing Rock Sioux tribe — along with hundreds of environmentalists and celebrities looking for a photo-op — decided to try to stop it. Obama did his best to help them. A Trump administration is likely to remove any remaining barriers so that pipeline can be completed.Third, Trump has said his administration will allow more drilling on federal land. That would be a big step toward achieving true energy independence.The U.S. is now the largest producer of crude oil and natural gas in the world, but we still import about 25% of the crude we need. Opening up more federal lands and offshore production will allow us to fill that gap.Trump has pledged to use the billions of dollars in federal mineral royalties to help pay for his ambitious infrastructure rebuilding program. A better use of those funds would be to offset the costs of his tax reform proposal.  But either way, it's refreshing to talk about growing government revenues without growing taxes.Increased production will also allow the U.S. to export more crude oil and natural gas to our allies, many of whom rely on Russia for their energy needs. For example, the European Union depends on Russia for about a third of its energy and would love to have an affordable alternative. Moving the U.S. from oil importer to oil exporter will also dramatically reduce our trade deficit, another Trump goal.Finally, Trump has pledged to revive the coal industry, especially ""clean coal."" That promise may be a bridge too far. While the EPA has indeed been hounding the coal industry beyond all reason, competition from natural gas is doing as much if not more damage.Innovative drilling techniques have swelled supplies and lowered the price of gas, making it one of the cheapest options for power generation. And it burns cleaner, emitting about half the carbon of coal.As a result of power plants shifting to gas, the U.S. Energy Information Administration recently announced that energy-related carbon emissions for the first six months of this year were down to their lowest level since 1991 — when there were about 60 million fewer Americans.President-elect Trump's energy agenda would be a shot in the economic arm. The government will be taking in mineral royalty revenue from energy companies and from income taxes they and their newly hired workers will pay. All President Trump has to do is get the government out of the way.
"
44,XL,"Politics: If you want to know why the economy has been struggling so much under President Obama, look no further than the arbitrary and capricious decision by his Army Corps of Engineers to block the Dakota Access pipeline it had already approved. How many days does he have left in office?In July, the Corps said it had approved 200 water crossings and easements for the 1,172-mile pipeline to cross Lake Oahe, Lake Sakakawea and the Missouri River.  When it's finished, the $3.8 billion project will transport 450,000 barrels of oil a day from western North Dakota to Patoka, Ill.But then protests erupted, fueled by environmentalist and misguided Native Americans, who said the pipeline's crossing of Lake Oahe could pollute water of the Standing Rock Sioux reservation in North Dakota. In September, President Obama egged the protestors on and said the Corps would look for alternative routes. On Sunday, the Army Corps decided to overturn itself, and deny the Lake Oahe easement until it explores these alleged alternative routes.Energy Transfer Partners, which is building the pipeline, called the decision ""a purely political action,"" accusing the Obama administration of having ""abandoned the rule of law in favor of currying favor with a narrow and extreme political constituency.""They've got that right.The company notes that it did everything by the book, according to the rules set out by the Corps, before getting its approval. Denying it after the fact makes no sense and sets a terrible precedent.Plus, it's not as though this area is pristine wilderness. In fact, there are at least two crude oil pipelines cross the Missouri river upstream from the Standing Rock reservation. That's to say nothing of the natural gas pipelines that crisscross North Dakota, the crude oil rail terminals along the river, the coal mines nearby, as well as other potential sources of water pollution.What's more, the blocked section of the pipeline wouldn't cross over or through the lake, but run deep underneath it.So the likely impact of this one additional pipeline, built to meet strict environmental standards, on North Dakota's water quality or the environment is negligible, if it exists at all.Indeed, if anything, blocking this pipeline will increase the risk of environmental harm, since the oil has to get to its destination somehow, which means relying on riskier forms of transportation such as trains.The real motivation of the environmentalists who joined this protest isn't to protect the purity of an Indian reservation's water. It's to make it increasingly difficult to drill, ship and consume oil.As The Hill noted, ""environmentalists took up Standing Rock's cause, pushing Obama to deny the project as part of the burgeoning 'keep it in the ground' movement to stop fossil fuel production in the United States.""This is, in fact, simply a replay of Obama's decision to derail the Keystone XL pipeline, not because of any legitimate environmental concern, but because he is — despite his supposed ""all of the above"" energy policy — captive of this extremist green movement.Thankfully, there will be a new sheriff in town in just over a month. President-elect Trump has promised voters an energy revolution as a key plank of his economic growth agenda. Getting the Dakota Access pipeline restarted, and green lighting the Keystone pipeline, would send a powerful message that he means it.

49,XL,"Billionaire Tom Steyer vowed to make climate change a major issue in the 2016 election. His plan was to link arms with the AFL-CIO to mobilize the Democratic base and recruit Millennial voters to rise up to defeat Donald Trump and put Hillary Clinton in the White House. He failed abysmally on every count.One might be tempted to feel pangs of sympathy for the man who is showing every sign of positioning himself for running for governor of California in two years and who presumably hoped his electoral heroics would make his star the shiniest among those Democrats aspiring to even greater heights.More's the pity that he spent so much of his own money in this failed effort. A lot of it. In fact, the hedge fund tycoon spent more money than any other individual in the 2016 election cycle. His crocodile-tear declaration in July that, ""We believe that there is too much emphasis on money in politics"" notwithstanding, Steyer and his super PAC NextGen Climate Action poured about $100 million into the election effort.The fact that most of that money came from Steyer's own checkbook suggests that climate change isn't much of a priority among other Democratic donors. Indeed, only 6% of Democrats listed climate change as their top concern, according to a Fox News poll of more than 1,000 registered voters taken just a year ahead of the election.Just 7% of Democrats identified climate change as the most important issue in determining which candidate to support for the party's presidential nominee in a February 2016 poll from Quinnipiac University. The New Republic calls climate change the biggest nonissue of this election cycle, noting how climate change was discussed for a scant 325 seconds in the presidential debates.Despite Steyer's spin suggesting this was the year for political action on climate change and that his army of millennials would push the issue over the top, Trump won one out of three millennial voters — 37%.  According to the Center for Information & Research on Civic Learning and Engagement (CIRCLE), 55% of voters aged 18 to 29 supported Hillary Clinton in comparison to Donald Trump's 37%. But Clinton had a poor showing in contrast to the 67% millennial voter support for Obama in 2012.In May, Steyer announced the formation of a new super PAC which would be a partnership between his NextGen Action and the AFL-CIO aimed at coordinating voter turnout efforts. But many union laborers were already furious with Steyer for leading the campaign to kill the Keystone XL pipeline and the thousands of high paying union jobs that went with it. Outraged officials from eight unions fumed that ""the AFL-CIO has now officially become infiltrated by financial and political interests that work in direct conflict to many of our members.""Terry O'Sullivan, president of the Laborers' International Union of North America wrote, ""We object to the political agenda of the AFL-CIO being sold to a job-killing hedge fund manager with a bag of cash.""Four years ago — before policies of Steyer's moneyed elite destroyed their jobs and caused green energy poverty by causing utility rates to skyrocket — union households supported Obama by an 18-point margin. In this election, their support for the Democratic candidate dropped a precipitous 10 points, with Clinton eking out an anemic eight-point lead within this traditional Democratic stronghold. In the end, rank-and-file union voters pushed Trump over the top in the critical states of Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania.This isn't the first time Steyer has failed spectacularly. During the 2014 midterm election, in which he was also the largest individual donor, he dumped more than $73 million in an effort in which very few of the candidates he backed won and in which climate change action actually dropped as a priority (from 37% of Americans before the election season to just 28% by election's end).With a track record of that kind of ""help"" Democrats would be well served to deliver one of Donald Trump's most famous lines on Tom Steyer: ""You're fired.""

51,XL,"Another day, another Hillary Clinton bombshell disclosure.This time the scandal comes from disgraced former congressman Anthony Weiner's laptop computer, bringing more suggestions of Clinton's sloppy attitude about U.S. intelligence law. Meanwhile, seemingly every day WikiLeaks produces more evidence of the Clinton Foundation leveraging the Clinton State Department for pay-for-play profiteering.At this point, Clinton has trumped former President Richard Nixon's skullduggery -- but without the offset of Nixon's foreign policy accomplishments.Even before the most recent scandals, Clinton's campaign had an eerie resemblance to the Nixon playbook.Compare the election of 2016 to the election of 1972. The favored Nixon re-election juggernaut (dubbed CREEP, or the ""The Committee for the Re-election of the President"") squeezed corporations and wealthy individuals for millions in donations, in much the same way that Clinton's multimillion-dollar cash machine has vastly outspent her opponent, Donald Trump.The Watergate tapes later revealed an entirely cynical Nixon campaign team and a hard-nosed White House cadre led by H.R. Haldeman and John Ehrlichman -- plus a host of lesser toadies, such as the conniving John Dean. They all took for granted that Washington functioned on a quid-pro-quo and pay-for-play basis.In that regard, the Clinton campaign under chairman John Podesta (the new Haldeman) has become Nixonian to the core, thanks to Podesta's ruthlessness.The WikiLeaks/Podesta email trove reveals that Hillary's consultants have no moral compass. They lampoon Latinos as ""needy."" Catholics are written off as being stuck in medieval times. Aides bartered with plutocrats for Secretary of State Clinton's face time on the basis of cash donations. A primary debate question was tipped off by CNN contributor and Democratic operative Donna Brazile.The nickname ""Tricky Dick"" referred to Nixon's perceived anything-goes campaign style and his ""flexibility"" on issues. CREEP's ""plumbers"" staged break-ins to look for leaked information. Petty activists supposedly tried to disrupt rallies for Nixon's 1972 opponent, George McGovern.Clinton is using similar tactics. In the ambush tapes of Project Veritas, Clinton's for-hire thugs bragged on film of provoking violence at Trump rallies and bringing in voters by bus to cast illegal ballots.The anti-communist and free-marketer Nixon turned out to be a wheeler-dealer who had no problem wooing communist China or imposing socialist wage and price controls.From hacked emails, it is clear that Hillary's positions on fracking, trade deals, the Keystone XL pipeline, immigration and foreign policy hinged on whatever best served her political self-interest.Most loyal aides who served Nixon ended up disgraced, jailed or humiliated. Does anyone think that Podesta, Cheryl Mills or Huma Abedin -- the fixers so prominent in the WikiLeaks scandal -- will have a political future, given their aiding and abetting of Clinton knavery and profiteering?We know that Nixon lied about what he had known about the cover-up of the Watergate break-in. And now we know from the WikiLeaks email dumps and the FBI investigation that Clinton likewise has never told the truth about her email server, the Clinton Foundation's pay-for-play schemes or the catalysts for the Benghazi killings.Nixon always attacked the messenger in hopes of discrediting the message -- and now Clinton is going after FBI Director James Comey.Nixon professed that he never knew the sordid details of his campaign's dirty tricks. Clinton has resorted to the same defense with regard to the shady activities of the now-disgraced subordinates who resigned after being caught trying to disrupt Trump rallies.Stonewalling was a Nixon specialty. Clinton told FBI investigators 27 times that she could not remember key details about the email scandal.A Democratic operative from a political action committee bragged on tape that Clinton herself liked the operative's idea of having protestors decked out in Donald Duck costumes provoke Trump supporters at his rallies. (""In the end, it was the candidate, Hillary Clinton, the future president of the United States, who wanted ducks on the ground,"" the operative said on tape.)Abedin wrote in an email to Podesta and Clinton aide Robby Mook that the idea of accepting $12 million to speak at an event held by a Moroccan-government-owned mining company (which had received a $92 million loan guarantee from the U.S.-financed Export-Import Bank) was Clinton's: ""This was HRC's idea, our office approached the Moroccans and they 100 percent believe they are doing this at her request.""A Clinton family advisor described shakedown efforts to reap millions of dollars for former President Bill Clinton as being the work of ""Bill Clinton Inc.""There remains, however, one disconnect.Nixon covered up misdeeds long enough to be re-elected in a 1972 landslide -- only later to resign before his looming impeachment, when even his administration flunkies could no longer mask his past misdeeds.Would an elected President Hillary Clinton eventually meet the same fate?This time around, there is not the same sort of investigative reporting that there was in 1973-1974. Much of the media is backing, rather than investigating, Clinton.Does the death of independent journalism ensure that Clinton's hubris will never earn a Nixonian comeuppance -- or at least not until after the election?RELATED:Hillary Clinton Email Scandal ExplainedClinton Foundation ScandalIBD/TIPP Presidential Election Tracking Poll: Latest ResultsTrump Opens Big Lead Over Clinton On Character, Economy: IBD/TIPP Poll

If that happens, the front air bags won't inflate in a crash and the seat belts may not work either.GM says the defect is linked to at least one death and three injuries.The company learned of the problem in May when a 2014 Chevrolet Silverado crashed and its air bags didn't deploy. GM notified Delphi Automotive (DLPH), the supplier that made the module. The two companies tested the modules and decided to recall the vehicles last week.

71,XL,"Election 2016: After the Democratic Convention, it quickly became common wisdom that, in selecting Tim Kaine as her vice presidential running mate, Hillary Clinton picked a solid political centrist who will poach votes from the Republicans. The only problem with that scenario is: Kaine is no centrist.Yes, he's reportedly a nice guy who, in interviews, describes himself as ""boring."" But to call him a centrist is a stretch.He supports curbs on the Second Amendment. He likes ObamaCare. He wants more federal government involvement in education and is OK with income redistribution through the tax code. He backs the government's unscientific war against ""climate change."" And, with Obama, opposed the job-creating Keystone XL pipeline.These are not centrist stances. He styles himself a ""traditional Catholic."" Really? He supports abortion. Regardless how you feel about abortion rights, you cannot support abortion and call yourself a ""devout"" Catholic.But those are mere political stances, and we know that all politicians' stances are malleable.How does he vote?Well, ""centrist"" Sen. Kaine of Virginia was recently scored by Conservative Review for his votes in office. He got a big fat ""zero"" -- no conservative votes at all, 100% liberal.Is that some kind of outlier, a mistake? Hardly. Claims of centrism notwithstanding, the liberal Americans for Democratic Action gave him a 90% rating on key liberal votes. And, despite his public agonizing over the abortion issue, he gets a 100% rating from Planned Parenthood, which calls Kaine ""a solid vote and really an ally.""The nonpartisan, but libertarian, Cato Institute has also given Kaine a grade in the past, though it did so when he was governor of Virginia from 2006 to 2010. Cato gave Kaine a ""D"" grade because he ""helped pass a large revenue package that included tax and fee increases, higher penalties for driving infractions and the creation of regional taxing authorities within Virginia."" That latter move was swatted down by the Virginia Supreme Court, by the way, as unconstitutional.A blog post on the arch-liberal Huffington Post web site even makes the case that Kaine is ""more progressive than Bernie Sanders,"" citing their records as recorded by the American Conservative Union, which ranks politicians based on two dozen key votes. The HuffPost notes that Kaine had a perfect ACU score of zero in 2013, his first year in the Senate, and was tied for the most liberal voting score in either the House or the Senate in both 2014 and 2015. Sanders actually had more pro-conservative votes than Kaine, according to the ACU.You'll hear a lot about the amiable ""centrist"" Democrat looking for your vote as vice president this election. But rhetoric deceives: He's truly a member of his party's far left.
"
72,XL,"Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump don't agree on much of anything, but there is one area where they have a meeting of the minds: They both want to spend way more on public works programs. Hillary ‎Clinton says that her primary jobs stimulus will be a massive $275 billion-plus infrastructure spending binge.Donald Trump one-upped Hillary last week promising to spend twice that amount. He says the money is necessary because of crumbling roads and ""bridges that are falling down.""It's a rare source of agreement, so wouldn't you know it: They're both wrong.If our infrastructure is crumbling, it surely isn't because the feds are spending too little money. Public works projects were supposed to be the centerpiece of the Obama $830 billion stimulus bill. We were promised ""shovel-ready"" jobs. Remember that? But job growth has remained abysmal for seven years. So what happened to all that money? No one in Washington wants to ask or answer.We now know a lot of the money didn't even get spent on public works, but got intercepted for projects like the now-bankrupt Solyndra solar energy company and more still for food stamps and welfare programs. Some of Obama's spending went to build big white elephants like the $70 billion California high-speed train‎ from and to nowhere, or low-return investments such as the Washington Metro Silver Line with at least five cost overruns and almost no riders.Over Obama's presidency, Washington has spent nearly $1 trillion on infrastructure. As the chart shows, this was more money than any other president in history has spent. Amazingly, it cost about $250 billion to build the interstate highway system.  Obama has spent at least three times more than that and we still have what more pot holes in America than jobs.Yet here we are with Hillary arguing for bigger deficits and more public works projects as the engine for growth revival. (At least Trump has a way to pay for infrastructure: He would allow companies to repatriate capital from abroad at a low tax rate and use the money raised to fix bridges and roads. He would also let an independent commission rather than politicians decide what projects should get funded.) The road builders, unions, municipal bond traders are drooling at the idea of all this money.Davis-Bacon rules make sure that nearly every penny goes to inflated union wages. For every three bridges we build, we could fix a fourth one for free just by jettisoning these costly regulatory hurdles. While Trump wants to deregulate to get more bang for our buck, Hillary is too beholden to special interests to allow that.We also need to spend our federal infrastructure dollars on projects that make sense. The real transportation scandal is that Congress keeps stealing almost 20 cents of every dollar from gas taxes, paid by motorists, to pay for transit projects that carry less than 5% of all commuters -- except for a few cities like New York. Congress keeps building mass transit trains even though in a decade or so bus and rail systems will go the way of rotary phones. Driverless-cars and smart road/traffic light technologies will personalize transportation and enable cheap and speedy door-to-door delivery.Most liberals I know hate cars and think, as Al Gore does, that the combustion engine is going to burn up the planet. So why would we expect the same people who want to get motorists off the roads and into buses and on bicycles to fix the highways? I remember reading once from a prominent leftist thinker that traffic jams are good because they are the ultimate sign of democracy and fairness. They waste time for everyone and make us all equally miserable.Hillary is the ultimate hypocrite on infrastructure because for the entire time she was secretary of state she postponed the building of the Keystone XL pipeline that would make oil and gas transportation cleaner and safer, create about 10,000 high-paying jobs, and would not cost taxpayers a dime.Nearly a dozen other cross-country pipelines have been blocked by the Obama-Clinton regulators, according to the Wall Street Journal. But Hillary is in the hip pocket of the radical greens who hate fossil fuels, so she is unlikely to approve any of them. We've spent $150 billion subsidizing green energy, but the oil and gas industry, which pays taxes, rather than consumes them, can't get approval for its infrastructure projects. We also need liquefied gas terminals and refineries in America -- but the government won't those get built either.The real infrastructure crisis in America is private infrastructure. Computers. Factories. Plants. Forklifts. Trucks. Warehouses. Businesses aren't buying them because they are bleak about the future. Business spending over the past year is negative. Partly that's because Obama has raised taxes on business investment. Hillary wants to raise the tax on private infrastructure financing again to as high as 45%. Donald Trump wants to cut those taxes to 15%. I wonder which will lead to more funding for bricks and mortar.Amazing: Obama has spent more than any other president, he has borrowed $8 trillion, he has promised millions of jobs, and yet after all of this, his own transportation secretary has called America ""one giant pothole.""  Now we're supposed to forget all this and do it all over again. 
"
73,XL,"Every president since Richard Nixon has promised to make America energy independent, but  we still import nine million barrels of oil a day, with much of it coming from the Middle East and OPEC.  Now for the first time in a half century -- thanks to the shale oil and gas revolution -- the dream of American energy independence is not just a pipedream but easily achievable if the next president takes the right steps to make it happen.This Made in America energy strategy means we could stop draining our economy of about $200 billion a year that could be used to rebuild our own country.  This isn't just about the economy.  We know from intelligence reports that as much as $500 million a year of petro-dollars find their way into the coffers of terrorist networks like ISIS.To achieve American energy self-sufficiency I'm not talking about the left's strange infatuation with building more windmills (sorry Hillary). We only get about 5% of our energy from windmills and solar panels.What I am talking about is about taking the strategic steps necessary to making the United States the energy dominant force on the planet within five to 10 years by using our super-abundance of fossil fuel resources.  Thanks to the amazing made-in-America technological breakthroughs of the last decade -- including horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing to get at shale oil and gas reserves -- the U.S. now has at least 150 years of oil and natural gas resources on top of 500 years of coal.Consider what has happened in less than a decade with oil production.  ‎In 2008 the U.S. produced about 5 million barrels a day. We hit 8.7 million ‎in 2014 and could double that by 2025.As we tap into the full potential of our tens of billions of shale oil and gas we can become the number one export nation on the planet. This could easily mean more than $1 trillion a year in oil, gas and also coal exports each year -- perhaps exceeding 5% of GDP.Let's not forget about coal.  America was built on coal, and our nation has far more of it than any other nation. And we burn it cleanly and efficiently, unlike the Chinese and India who build hundreds of coal plants every year, but spew out dirty emissions.I estimate that with five simple steps taken by the next president, America will gain its energy independence:1. Allow drilling and mining permits on federal lands.  So far at least 90% of the shale gas and shale oil revolution has happened on private land.  But around half of all the land west of the Mississippi is government owned.  We estimate there are $50 trillion of energy resources stored underneath non-environmentally sensitive federal lands.  This is the biggest treasure chest in the world.2. Build a national network of pipelines across the country by allowing the permitting for projects like Keystone XL and many others.  Right now the federal government is holding up as many as a dozen necessary pipelines to get the oil and gas across the country and then shipped across the world.3. Build refineries and liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals in the United States. The Energy Information Agency says the latest refiner ""began operating in 1977"" – or almost 40 years ago even though the U.S. population has nearly doubled since the mid 1970s and our energy production has doubled as well.4. Stop the Obama war on coal.  The environmentalists have tried to shutdown coal production, the next president should revive it.  This means putting a muzzle on the EPA to allow our energy resources to be harnessed and used in an environmentally responsible way.  Environmental rules have to be shown to be cost-effective, meaning that the cost to the economy of complying with the rules is justified on the basis of the environmental benefits -- and measured honestly.5. End all subsidies for all forms of energy. The left complains about taxpayer subsidies for oil and gas. The best way to promote efficient energy is to let the free market work and remove government handouts – particularly to the green energy sector.If we get this right, America can declare its independence from OPEC and Middle Eastern oil.  We can become the Saudi Arabia of the 21st century.

74,XL,"Hillary Clinton is a seasoned liberal politician, but one with few core beliefs. Her positions on subjects such as gay marriage, free-trade agreements, the Keystone XL pipeline, the Iraq War, the Assad regime in Syria and the use of the term ""radical Islam"" all seem to hinge on what she perceives 51% of the public to believe on any given day.Such politicians believe truth is a relative construct. Things are deemed false by politicians only if they cannot convince the public that they are true -- and vice versa. When the majority of Americans no longer believe Clinton's yarns about her private email server to the point of not wanting to vote for her, then she will change her narrative and create new, convenient truths to reflect the new consensus.Donald Trump is an amateur politician but a politician nevertheless. He is ostensibly conservative, but he likewise seems to change his positions on a number of issues -- from abortion to the Iraq War -- depending on what he feels has become the majority position. And as with Clinton, Trump's idea of truth is defined as what works, while falsity is simply any narrative that proved unusable.Politicians glad-hand, pander and kiss babies as they seek to become megaphones for majority opinions. But ideologues are different. They often brood and lecture that their utopian dreams are not shared by the supposedly less-informed public.To gain power, of course, ideologues can temporarily become political animals. Barack Obama ran in 2008 on popular positions such as reducing the national debt and opposing gay marriage and immigration amnesties, only to flip after he was re-elected and no longer needed to pander to perceived majority opinions.But otherwise, Obama the ideologue seems to believe that big redistributive government is always necessary to achieve a mandated equality of result -- regardless of whether it ever works or should work in reality. He opposes a reduction in capital gains tax rates even though he concedes that such cuts might bring in more revenue.The administration has deemed the Affordable Care Act successful even though Obama's assurances that it would lower deductibles and premiums, give patients greater choices, and ensure continuity in medical providers and plans have all proven to be untrue.No matter: Obamacare fulfills the president's preconceived notion that state-mandated health care is superior to what the private sector can provide.Abroad, Obama starts from the premise that an overweening U.S. is not to be congratulated for saving the world in World War II, winning the Cold War and ushering in globalization. Instead, its inherent unfairness to indigenous peoples, its opposition to revolutionary regimes and its supposed interventionist bullying disqualify it from being a moral and muscular leader of the world.As a consequence of all this, facts often must be created to match pre-existing ideology.A homophobic, radical Islamic terrorist in Orlando shouted ""Allahu akbar"" as he mowed down the innocent in a gay nightclub. He called 911 to make sure the world knew that his killing spree was in service to the Islamic State. And in the midst of his murdering, he even called a local TV news station to brag on his jihadist martyrdom in progress.No matter. To Obama, who asserts that radical Islamic terrorism, which he refuses to identify in such terms, poses little threat (far less of a threat, he has said, than the dangers posed by accidental falls in bathtubs), the Orlando shooting was instead a symptom of a lack of gun control or endemic homophobia -- anything other than what the killer himself said it was.Guns, of course, had nothing to do with the 3,000 people killed on 9/11, with the Boston Marathon bombing, or with recent terrorist attacks in Oklahoma and at the University of California, Merced,  perpetrated by blade-wielding assailants. Tight restrictions on semi-automatic weapons could no more stop shootings in Europe than stop an epidemic of inner-city shootings in Chicago. No matter: The Orlando shooting must be ascribed to the availability of guns rather than to radical Islamic terrorism.In both word and deed, Iran, Cuba and Turkey are revolutionary societies in turmoil that have often voiced anti-Americanism. But to Obama, who at times has warmed up to all three, those regimes fit his deductive notion that America's past behavior has earned it understandable antipathy from countries with legitimate grievances.Bipartisan analyses agree that the withdrawal of all troops from Iraq in December 2011 threw away the victory obtained by the American surge of 2007, eroded the foundation of the nascent Iraqi democracy, and helped to birth and empower the Islamic State.But to an ideologue like Obama, the withdrawal simply reflected a universal truth that the U.S. must get out and leave the Middle East to its rightful owners -- even if the president has been forced to send nearly 5,000 troops back into Iraq.In general, politicians are rank opportunists, but at least most of them are malleable and attuned to public opinion.But ideologues are far more anti-empirical -- and thus dangerous.
"
75,XL,"Bernie Sanders is not going gently into that good night, at least not yet.After hearing Monday from the Associated Press that Hillary Clinton had clinched the nomination, after absorbing Tuesday night a solid defeat in the California primary and losses in three other states, Sanders was still pledging to go on campaigning for the District of Columbia's 20 delegates in its primary next Tuesday and to fight on until the Democratic National Convention opens in Philadelphia July 25.It's possible to ridicule Sanders' protests that he can still win the nomination of a party of which he's never been a member. But give him credit. He won 42% of the popular vote in primaries against Hillary Clinton and a whopping 62% of the votes cast in caucuses.He carried 23 states, from Maine to Hawaii, and came within 2% of carrying five others. He carried or came close to carrying white Democrats nationally.More important, he moved Hillary Clinton -- and the Democratic Party -- well to the left.Clinton reversed previous positions and came out against the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement and against the Keystone XL pipeline. She promised that she would effectively end fracking, which has sharply reduced oil and natural gas prices, and would discourage the mining of coal.She came close to matching Sanders' promise of free college. She repudiated her husband's 1994 crime bill and his support of financial deregulation. Yes, a second President Clinton could and probably would welch on some of these promises.But she's not going back to the first President Clinton's policies.Sanders can claim credit for moving the Democratic Party closer to his own political creed, socialism, than any Democrat has cared or dared to do before. He did so with the critical help of young voters, the millennial generation, who voted about 80% for him against Clinton -- and for whom, multiple polls suggest, his self-proclaimed socialism is not a bug but a feature.A YouGov survey in January, for example, found that 43% of under-30s were favorable toward socialism and only 26% unfavorable. A 2015 Reason-Rupe poll in 2015 found 48% of under-35s positive toward socialism. A 2010 Pew Research poll found 43% of under-30s positive toward socialism, nearly twice the 23% favorable among those over 30.The promise of what Mitt Romney infelicitously called ""free stuff"" may account for some of the attractiveness of socialism to Americans too young to have any living memory of the collapse of communism and to have been taught a history that emphasizes the iniquities of oppressive Western societies. Hey, free college and free health care don't sound so bad.Those who have actually had experience with government-run economies feel differently, as one can see from recent political results in Latin America.In Venezuela, the socialism of the late President Hugo Chavez and his chosen successor, Nicolas Maduro, has destroyed the oil-rich nation's economy, to the point that toilet paper, groceries and medicines are simply unavailable, crime has soared to world-high rates and pro-government thugs crack down on protesters. Voters elected an opposition legislature, but Maduro is defying the law to stay in power.In Argentina, voters in December repudiated leftist President Cristina Kirchner and elected businessman Mauricio Macri. In Brazil, leftist President Dilma Rousseff was impeached last month and removed from office pending trial in the Senate amid record unemployment and the revelation of multimillion-dollar bribery conspiracies.Peru has just had a close presidential election between two candidates both described by Reuters as ""business friendly.""Or look at Sanders' favorite example, Scandinavia, where governments have, as Emily Elkins and Joy Pullman write in The Federalist, ""opened their economies to free-market forces in the 1990s, sold off state-owned companies, eased restrictions on business startups, reduced barriers to trade and business regulation, and introduced more competition into health care and public services.""You didn't hear much about these developments in the Democratic primaries and caucuses. Nor did you hear much about the dismal performance of government here in everything from veterans' hospitals to Washington's Metrorail. You just heard bland assurances that an expanded government could provide free goodies without perceptible costs or glitches.Hillary Clinton's leftward lurch in response to Sanders may not prevent her from beating Donald Trump. But it may not serve America or the Democratic Party well in the long run.

76,XL,"Politics: After Republicans took back Congress, it was clear they'd clash with President Obama on nearly every issue. They have. Now, Obama is using executive orders and regulation to do what he wants anyway.Meanwhile, Republicans have been in a holding pattern, with little evidence that they intend to advance much of anything important when it comes to legislation.They've avoided confrontation when head-butting is what's needed and desired by Republican primary voters given the far-left agenda of this White House.Congressional GOP leaders promised that they would push pro-growth initiatives through Congress and land them on President Obama's desk.The strategy was to force Obama to swallow hard and sign bills or veto legislation that has broad public support. This would have the bonus benefit of cornering vulnerable congressional red-state Democrats into taking tough votes both on bill passage and veto overrides.When Nancy Pelosi was elevated to Speaker of the House she became an expert at this tactic. George W. Bush was forced politically to sign bad bills on energy regulation and minimum-wage hikes, just to name a few.The liberal agenda picked up ground in 2007 and 2008, laying the groundwork for the Obama coup.So where are the GOP bills and where are the Obama vetoes? So far this year Obama has only had to veto two bills and only four total as president.By comparison, President Bill Clinton, faced with a sudden Republican majority just as President Obama is, vetoed over 30 bills.When a Republican Congress under Newt Gingrich sent a torrent of popular laws to Clinton, he often caved in. He eventually signed a conservative welfare reform bill — after vetoing similar bills twice — and a growth-enhancing capital gains tax cut.Obama's only noteworthy veto this year was the bill to build the Keystone XL pipeline.Conservatives are now fuming that Senate Republicans allowed Democrats to avoid a series of tough votes on the wildly unpopular Iran non-treaty.Why?The John Boehner-Mitch McConnell strategy needs to be revived to highlight in vivid colors the distinction between Republicans and Democrats on key issues.Here are just a few bills that the GOP should push through Congress immediately and force Obama's hand. Reduce the corporate tax rate from 35% to 25% (the international average) to avoid more companies fleeing the U.S. Overturn Obama EPA regulations on natural gas and coal production. These rules are killing our domestic energy production, sharply reducing U.S. GDP growth and costing hundreds of thousands of American jobs. Repeal the medical device tax that holds back medical innovation. Create a 5% repatriation tax to bring back to these shores money held by American companies overseas. Repeal the ObamaCare regulation requiring firms with 50 or more workers to offer health insurance. Restore the historical legal separation between companies and franchise-store owners to encourage more small-business creation.These laws would create jobs and lift the economy. There are many more that should showcase to voters that Republicans are the party of solutions, and Obama is the agent of gridlock.In politics sometimes you win when you lose. No one expects Republicans to win every battle but they do expect them to stand up and fight.

You may be accused of ""environmental racism.""If you weren't aware ""environmental"" and ""racism"" could go together, you're not alone. But then, this White House sees a racist conspiracy in just about everything, including global warming.So it has tasked the EPA with conjuring up sweeping industry guidelines to protect minority communities (or as agency insiders call them, ""environmental justice communities"") against what it sees as racist polluters.Behind the scenes, EPA bureaucrats are finalizing the new guidelines, known collectively as ""Draft EJ 2020 Action Agenda Framework"" (EJ stands for environmental justice) to be integrated into all agency programs, including rule-writing, permitting and enforcement.Overseeing implementation is a Cabinet-wide task force — ""Interagency Working Group on Environmental Justice"" — that includes top-level representatives from 17 agencies, including transportation and justice.Racially balancing pollution, ZIP code by ZIP code, is a hot topic of the group's meetings.

96,XL,"Let's look back on the primary campaign -- completed for Republicans, still ongoing for Democrats -- and see if we can identify what Sherlock Holmes referred to as dogs that didn't bark.For what's unusual about this campaign is not only that unexpected things happened -- improbable candidates Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders getting more than 40% of their parties' popular votes -- but that things everyone has come to expect did not.One clear example is the declining salience of the abortion issue. For a quarter-century this has been a litmus test for both parties' presidential nominations: Republicans wouldn't seriously consider pro-choice candidates; Democrats wouldn't seriously consider pro-lifers.Much less has been heard about it this year. Donald Trump's conversion to pro-life got perfunctory mention, but clearly didn't sway many voters. Neither did Hillary Clinton's pro-choice fealty.Why? The issue seems to be settled, in a way most voters find tolerable. Abortion is not going to be criminalized, but it is increasingly stigmatized. The abortion rate peaked in 1980, and the absolute number of abortions has been declining since 1990.Abortions, like divorces and extramarital births, are rare among upscale Americans; they've become a mostly downscale phenomenon. Abortion clinics are closing, due to lack of demand as well as restrictive state laws. The procedure is disfavored in medical schools, where about half their students are women.""Choice"" -- the brilliant euphemism for abortion -- is not rallying voters to Clinton like her strategists had hoped. For women of a certain age, the abortion issue is a proxy for other choices they have made that run contrary to how they were brought up.These women have been giving Clinton big margins over Sanders. But younger women, raised to assume they should work outside the home, have voted heavily for Sanders. It's not clear they'll rally to the polls for Clinton in November.If women have not been united among Democrats, evangelical Protestants have not been united among Republicans. Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum, big winners among evangelicals in 2008 and 2012, had almost no support, even in Iowa, which they both won. Evangelicals voted in large numbers for Trump as well as Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio.One reason is the vast change of opinion on same-sex marriage, now supported by about one-third of Republicans and clear majorities of all voters. Religious conservatives dismayed by this may simply be turning away from politics or voting on other issues. You didn't hear candidates boasting they were the strongest gay-marriage opponents.Also largely missing from this year's campaign have been foreign policy appeals, which have prevailed in the past. Sanders berates Clinton for her 2002 vote authorizing military action in Iraq, but with less effect than Barack Obama had in 2008. Trump accuses the last Republican president of lying us into war and wins the party's nomination nonetheless.You heard some Republican candidates vow to vanquish the Islamic State terrorists in Iraq and Syria, but none proposed anything like the massive military efforts launched in 1991 and 2003, much less ""nation building.""Nor has there been much talk from the three remaining candidates about honoring the nation's commitments to NATO or our Asian allies. What you have heard from all three is a repudiation of free-trade policies followed by administrations of both parties since the 1930s.From all three you've heard moaning about today's economy -- and total unawareness that policies they oppose have over the last 70 years built a world of increasing prosperity and growing freedom.Trump talks vaguely of ""making America great again,"" a backward-looking slogan that invites voters to imagine some time when everything worked. But a trade war doubling all prices at Wal-Mart isn't going to get us there.Clinton has allowed Sanders to push her left on the Pacific trade agreement, the Keystone XL pipeline and Social Security: She now wants to increase already undeliverable benefits. As for promises of free college and health care, the experience of the last 30 years shows that pumping government money into these sectors only makes them more expensive.A case can be made that old issues have become stale: No reason for the old dogs to bark anymore. But they've been replaced by a different kind of barking or braying -- angry rhetoric, nostalgia for imagined pasts and litanies of laughably unrealistic policies. That's not a step forward for America or the world.

97,XL,"Party Politics: Every day there are stories about how deeply troubled the Republican Party is with Donald Trump as its presumptive candidate. But, if anything, the Democratic Party is in far worse shape.Think about it. Democrats still can’t decide if Hillary Clinton is electable -- in fact, her support has diminished as the primary season has dragged on. There are fears of a party revolt by Bernie Sanders supporters at the July convention, and there’s a huge rift forming between two of its major factions. Plus, polls show that the supposedly can't-possibly-win Donald Trump is now close to Clinton.The latest evidence of trouble came with Tuesday's primaries, where Clinton beat Sanders by a mere half a percentage point -- 46.8% to 46.3% -- in Kentucky, a state where in 2008 Clinton walloped Obama by 66% to 30%. Sanders beat her in Oregon by an almost 10-point margin.Of the past 20 primaries, Clinton has won only eight to Sanders' 12. And as the accompanying chart shows, her vote average has dropped sharply in the second half of the primary season, while Sanders' climbed. As a result, her lead among delegates today is actually narrower than it was back in late March.To make matters worse, 150 “superdelegates"" -- who can pick their candidate independent of any primary -- could put Clinton over the top right now by announcing their support for her but, as Bloomberg reports, they are still refusing to do so.Meanwhile, the party is increasingly worried that Sanders supporters, feeling they had the nomination snatched from them by a rigged system, could stage damaging protests at the party's convention, after his supporters turned a Nevada state Democratic convention into a chaotic mess.""Many Democrats fear that if Sanders does not rein in his supporters, the same ugly scene that occurred in Las Vegas last weekend could replicate itself in the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia,"" is how CNN put it.If that weren't enough, a major fight has developed between two of the Democratic Party’s most important constituencies -- rich environmentalists and labor unions. After the AFL-CIO announced that it was teaming up for a get-out-the-vote effort with billionaire climate-change fanatic Tom Steyer -- who helped block the job-creating Keystone XL pipeline -- several building-trade groups sent a blistering letter to Richard Trumka saying the AFL-CIO has ""now officially become infiltrated by financial and political interests that work in direct conflict to many of our members' -- and yes, AFL-CIO dues paying members' lives.""Terry O’Sullivan, head of the Laborers' International Union of North America, called the partnership a “politically bankrupt betrayal” of union members.As a result, ""Trump could well outperform Clinton with the unions that signed on to the letter, a heavily working-class and white male demographic,"" the New York Times reports.Trump is far from an ideal candidate, in our view, given his liberal bent and erratic personality, and his prospective nomination poses real risks to the Republican Party's future.But at this point, the GOP looks like a proverbial island of stability compared with the Democrats.

98,XL,"When Bill and Hillary Clinton moved out of the White House fifteen years ago, they were “dead broke,” says Hillary. Today they’re worth up to $150 million. A new documentary, Clinton Cash, reveals how they went from broke to filthy rich, with an emphasis on filthy.The Clintons have made out like bandits compared with another political couple, former Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell and his wife Maureen. The McDonnells were convicted of accepting over $150,000 in gifts while in office from a businessman.The Clintons raked in seven hundred times that amount -- $105 million--  under the pretext of speaking fees while Hillary Clinton was in public office. Yet the McDonnells face time in the big house, while the Clintons are aiming for the White House.Clinton Cash is based on a book by former Hoover Institution fellow Peter Schweizer that has withstood a year of intense scrutiny by critics. It’s fact, not fiction, and the facts are compelling.The documentary whisks you to corrupt places around the globe where the Clintons personally pocketed six figure speaking fees or collected billions for their family foundation. How? Trading on Hillary’s position as Secretary of State and possible future presidency. They sold out to titans, dictators and shady characters in Nigeria, the Congo, Kazakhstan, United Arab Emirates, not to mention Goldman Sachs and TD Bank.Along the way, the Clintons betrayed values they profess on the campaign trail – human rights, environmentalism, and democracy. Schweizer plans a screening to coincide with the Democratic National Convention --to show the party faithful how the Clintons sabotaged liberal principles to amass a fortune.The Clintons earned the bulk of their money from speaking fees.   How could making millions be that simple? It’s not. Bill’s fees skyrocketed when Hillary became Secretary of State in 2009, suggesting that countries and companies hiring him counted on getting more than Bill – they wanted what his wife had to offer.For example, a Nigerian newspaper publisher tied to the ruling People’s Democratic Party (anything but democratic) paid Bill a whopping $1.4 million to deliver two speeches in 2011 and 2012. The Clintons closed their eyes to the human rights abuses by Nigeria’s brutal president Goodluck Jonathan.Instead, Secretary Clinton made an official visit to Nigeria in 2012, congratulating Jonathan on his nonexistent “reform efforts.” American legitimacy bestowed at a bargain price. Just the opposite of what Human Rights Watch had implored Secretary Clinton to do.Here’s another: TD Bank never paid Bill Clinton to speak during his first eight years out of the White House. But in 2009, four days after Hillary was nominated Secretary of State, Bill made the first of a string of speeches for which TD Bank paid almost $2 million. An astounding  amount.And guess what? TD Bank was the single largest shareholder in the Keystone XL pipeline, which required State Department approval. Lo and behold, Hillary Clinton decided to support the pipeline – a heresy to environmentalists – and delayed the Obama administration’s rejection of it.Coincidence? There’s no smoking gun proving Clinton speaking fees came with promises in return. But Schweizer says the evidence points to a pattern of conduct that other politicians would never get away with. They’re sent to jail for less.Like the McDonnells, convicted of corruption for accepting  a Rolex and other luxuries from a businessman. Their lawyers argue they’re innocent because they merely opened doors. They never expressly said “pay me and I’ll do what you want.”The McDonnells appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, where their conviction may be overturned. The Clintons must be watching intently. Chief Justice Roberts suggested that politicians shouldn’t be convicted of corruption unless there’s proof of a quid pro quo.That might be a good rule for courts. But voters can smell the corruption in pay-to-play politics. That’s why on election day they should vote against the Queen of Crooked, Hillary Clinton.
"
99,XL,"There's a good reason why Texas is often called ""America's economic miracle"" — the Lone Star State led the nation in job creation before, during and after the Great Recession.From 2007 to 2014, the state created nearly 1.6 million jobs, and its employment level grew by more than 14% — 31 times the paltry 0.46% growth rate for jobs nationwide.Under Gov. Rick Perry's leadership, Texas created nearly 28% of all new jobs nationally — the majority of which paid average or above average wages.Much has been said recently about the Texas economy being tested by a drop in oil prices. As the nation's largest producer of oil and gas, it's natural that Texas would feel the effects of a 45% decline in oil prices over the last year.The state's oil and gas industry payrolls have decreased by more than 2,000 jobs over the last six months through May — the largest six-month job loss for the industry since the Great Recession.Some have compared the recent energy downturn to the 1980s, when an oil shock crippled the state. But the state has actively worked to diversify its economy since then.Case in point: Oil and gas extraction has decreased as a share of economic output in Texas, accounting for more than 19% of the state's economy in 1982, but less than 11% in recent years. Meanwhile, growth in other Texas industries has exploded as a result of the state's low-tax environment, stable rules and regulations, skilled workforce, and responsible legal environment that have come to be known as the Texas Model. While Perry was in office, CEO Magazine ranked Texas the No. 1 state to do business for ten years in a row, and 1.7 million companies filed to do business in the state.Austin has become the new Silicon Valley and Texas surpassed California in 2012 for the first time ever to become the nation's largest high-tech exporting state.Houston is a medical mecca — its Texas Medical Center is the largest medical center in the world — and the state is top ranked for employing biotech-related scientists and doctorate holders.Dallas is a global transportation hub, and the state is home to the headquarters of two international airlines and two of the world's busiest airports.For the last several years, Texas metro areas have led the nation with the most entrepreneurial startup activity, according to the annual Kauffman Index of Entrepreneurship.In 2015, Austin ranked as the most entrepreneurial metro area in the country, followed by Houston at No. 8, San Antonio at No. 10 and Dallas at No. 15.Such economic diversification and job growth were not inevitable, and the Texas Miracle is often reduced to the state's booming oil and gas industry. In fact, according to the Texas Workforce Commission, there were 88,000 jobs created in the oil and gas industry from 2009-2014.That was far fewer than the Texas jobs created in other sectors over that period, like education and health services (243,200), trade and transportation (230,000), leisure and hospitality (201,200) and professional and business services (253,600).Importantly, employment in non-energy Texas industries continues to grow even now. Job growth in financial activities is up by 2.8% in May from a year ago, education and health services jobs are up 3.8%, retail trade and transportation payrolls are both up about 3.5%, and leisure and hospitality employment is up 5.5%.This economic diversification helps explain why Texas continues to outperform the rest of the nation on major labor market indicators, in spite of an oil price shock and a weak U.S. economy. The Lone Star State's unemployment rate in May was 4.3% — the 104th consecutive month that Texas' unemployment rate has been at or below the national average.And over the last year through May, the state added 262,800 new private jobs for an annual growth rate of 2.7% compared to a 1.1% increase in private jobs nationally.Unfortunately, Obama's policies haven't done much to help the rest of the country achieve the Texas Miracle.The U.S. continues to have the highest corporate tax rate in the developed world, putting our domestic manufacturers at a competitive disadvantage. The administration refuses to pass the Keystone XL pipeline and has left an arcane energy export ban in place, making the oil price shock more punishing for our producers and job creators. And the Obama administration has saddled the economy with $2 trillion in taxes and thousands of pages of regulation — the negative effects of which are being felt in every state.The good news is that the business-friendly conservative principles that brought jobs and economic growth to Texas can and should be the centerpiece of a national economic policy.What worked so well for Texans in America's economic miracle state can work for all Americans if the ""Texas Model"" can be successfully implemented nationwide. Perry is a resident scholar at The American Enterprise Institute and a professor of economics at the Flint campus of The University of Michigan.

100,XL,"What happens when protesters learn they're being used by billionaires? They dig in their ideological heels and shout insults.As hydraulic fracturing and Canadian oil sands development sent North American petroleum production soaring, new pipelines were approved and constructed, including the Keystone system's first three phases. They augmented 2.5 million miles of liquid petroleum, gas transmission and gas distribution pipelines that already crisscross the U.S.But when the Keystone XL segment was proposed, intense opposition suddenly materialized. Protesters railed that habitat disturbance, potential leaks, climate change and ending fossil-fuel use necessitated ""no more pipelines.""Now the Sandpiper Pipeline from North Dakota's Bakken shale region across Minnesota to Superior, Wis., is meeting similar resistance. As with Keystone, the protesters say they're concerned student, hiker and Native American grass-roots activists. The facts do not support their narrative.Putin-allied Russian billionaires laundered $23 million through the Bermuda-based Wakefield Quin law firm to the Sea Change Foundation and thence to anti-fracking and anti-Keystone groups, the Environmental Policy Alliance found. Sandpiper opponents are likewise funded and coordinated by wealthy financiers and shadowy foundations, researcher Ron Arnold discovered.Several small groups are involved in Sandpiper. But the campaign is coordinated by Honor the Earth, a Native American group that is actually a Tides Foundation ""project,"" with the Tides Center as its ""fiscal sponsor,"" contributing $700,000 and extensive in-kind aid. Out-of-state donors provide 99% of Honor's funding.The Indigenous Environmental Network also funds Honor the Earth. Minnesota corporate records show no incorporation entry for IEN, and that 95% of its money comes from outside Minnesota. Tides gave IEN $670,000 to oppose pipelines. Indeed, $25 billion in foundation investment portfolios support the anti-Sandpiper effort. Vastly more backing makes the $13-billion-per-year U.S. environmentalist movement a power to be reckoned with, Arnold and I document in our book, ""Cracking Big Green.""These tax-exempt foundations do not simply give money to pressure groups. They tell them what campaigns to conduct, what tactics to use. Meanwhile, donors enjoy deductions for ""charitable giving"" to ""education, conservation and other social change"" programs.Tides Foundation combined cash flows exceed $200 million a year, Canadian investigative journalist Cory Morningstar reports. She and fellow sleuth Vivian Krause have delved deeply into troubling arrangements among Big Green, Big Government and Big Finance.Morningstar calls the San Francisco-based Tides operation ""a priceless, magical, money funneling machine of epic proportions."" It enables uber-rich donors to distribute funds to specific organizations and campaigns of their choice, without disclosing their identities.Even more interesting, among Tides' biggest donors is Obama friend and advisor Warren Buffett. Beginning in 2004, Buffett funneled $30.5 million through his family's NoVo Foundation to Tides, and ultimately to selected pressure groups that led campaigns against Keystone and other projects, Morningstar and Arnold discovered.By donating the market value of greatly appreciated Berkshire Hathaway shares to NoVo, the Omaha billionaire avoided income taxes on his gains. Even more important, while public, media and political attention was riveted on Keystone, Berkshire Hathaway quietly bought the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad and Union Tank Car manufacturing company — with no notice, dissent or interference, Morningstar observed.When Keystone XL et al. were blocked, more oil was shipped by rail — much of it via Buffett companies. In fact, oil-by-rail skyrocketed from 9,500 carloads in 2009 to 450,000 carloads in 2014. Buffett's ""investment"" in anti-pipeline activism garnered billions in rail revenues.The anti-pipeline campaigns thwarted thousands of jobs and increased risks of tank car derailments, like the Lac Megantic, Quebec, spill that destroyed much of the town and immolated 47 people. That may be one reason why Buffett recently criticized President Obama's veto of Keystone XL legislation. He now says the pipeline would be good for both Canada and America, and it is a mistake to jeopardize trade relationships with Canada.But the campaigns rage on. They are not grassroots, or even AstroTurf. Their ""green"" tint is the color of unfathomable behind-the-scenes wealth.The clandestine Buffett-Berkshire-NoVo-Tides-activist-railroad arrangement reflects ""a devious strategy on the part of both benefactor and recipient,"" Morningstar concludes. ""At minimum, it demonstrates an almost criminal conflict of interest."" Perhaps legislators and regulators should investigate.Meanwhile, pro-Sandpiper students from the Collegians For A Constructive Tomorrow presented these inconvenient financial truths to anti-pipeline protesters at an April 30 University of Minnesota rally.One red-faced protester walked away. Others intensified their chants or shouted racially tinged epithets at the multi-ethnic CFACT students. None wanted to discuss funding issues, America's need for oil or how best to transport fuels safely. Such is the state of ""environmental studies,"" ""robust debate"" and ""higher education"" on campuses today. Driessen is senior policy analyst for the Committee For A Constructive Tomorrow and co-author of ""Cracking Big Green: Saving the world from the Save-the-Earth money machine.""

101,XL,"No thanks to lengthy licensing delays on construction projects, U.S. energy infrastructure is under increasing strain.The current problems require urgent attention to insure that private investment is put to productive uses, like the construction of oil and gas pipelines and improvements to the electric-power grid.Now is the time — past due time — to impose a time limit on government decision-making. Only then will companies be able to make informed, sensible decisions, confident that they will be told in a reasonable period of time whether a project will be approved or not.Transparency and disclosure are essential. The Keystone XL pipeline experience shows us the importance of limiting the time that the government takes to reach a decision.President Obama has repeatedly stalled on a decision regarding the pipeline, despite its importance to the oil and gas industry and to our nation's economy as a whole. Regulatory delays are holding up more than a dozen other interstate pipeline projects.Recent developments throughout the energy sector underscore the problems posed by uncertainty.With energy infrastructure, you can't turn any dirt without government playing a role in regulation, rights of way, bonds and public-private contracts with detailed oversight.Nearly all large projects — power plants, wind farms, transmission lines — come in way over budget and behind schedule, in no small part due to regulatory uncertainty.We can't expect to keep even existing energy infrastructure to continue operation because of unimaginably complex and ever-changing government regulations.Consider nuclear power, which supplies nearly 20% of the nation's electricity.Some nuclear plants, crucial as they are, might have to close prematurely because of interminable delays in getting their operating licenses renewed.Although an application to renew the license of the Indian Point nuclear plant in New York State was submitted seven years ago, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has yet to reach a decision on its continued operation.Nor, after eight years of study, has the NRC said whether it will allow the Pilgrim nuclear plant in Massachusetts to generate electricity once its license expires.The loss of either plant will likely lead to power shortages and increases in air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.Maintaining a strong energy infrastructure is essential to our nation's economic and environmental security. Without a robust network of pipelines to deliver natural gas to power plants, efforts to switch from coal to gas in electricity production will be hampered. And carbon emissions will likely increase.Recent developments underscore the challenges presented by a lack of stability and predictability in government regulation.In New England, where companies have been unable to build large-scale infrastructure projects, a pipeline shortage has led to rising costs for natural gas and electricity, along with economic strain, despite its proximity to the Marcellus shale, the nation's largest gas field.Because New England lacks adequate gas pipeline capacity, the total cost of electricity on a single day in January 2013 was $100 million more than it would have been if New England had experienced prices like those of the rest of the nation, according to a study by the Industrial Energy Consumer Group, which represents some of region's largest industrial facilities.Just how troublesome the situation becomes will depend in large measure on what the U.S. government does to fix the regulatory system for our energy infrastructure.The continuing absence of a coherent regulatory policy would mean continuing deterioration of the nation's energy infrastructure, which would result in less domestic energy production, delayed construction plans, reduced payrolls and deferred development of a smart electric grid and pipeline system.A smarter and more streamlined approach to government energy policy, with the right regulatory regime and a firm time limit on decision-making, would mean quite the opposite.If high and increasing levels of investment ensue, it could hasten the development of a robust and resilient energy infrastructure, encourage a switch to cleaner energy technologies and promote economic development. Perry is a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, a professor of economics at the Flint campus of the University of Michigan and a member of IBD's Brain Trust.

102,XL,"Leadership: President Obama's quiet veto of the Keystone XL pipeline is a study in political cowardice. But slinking away from a popular bill on technical grounds won't fool voters. It's time for Congress to step in to override it.It was only the third veto of his presidency, and for some reason he didn't have much to say about it. In fact, it would be hard to find more gobbledygook intended to obscure his true thoughts in his written statement about his Keystone XL veto Tuesday.""Through this bill, Congress attempts to circumvent longstanding and proven processes for determining whether or not building and operating a cross-border pipeline serves the national interest,"" read President Obama's written statement.""And because this act of Congress conflicts with established executive branch procedures and cuts short through consideration of issues that could bear on our national interest — including our security, safety and environment — it has earned my veto.""""Processes?"" ""Cuts short through consideration?"" Anyone have any idea what he's talking about?He just vetoed an 1,179-mile, $8 billion engine of American energy security and the thousands of jobs for Americans that would come of it, and he's claiming it was his own fussy worries about ""procedures"" and a need for more red tape.Canada called it ""a slap in the face"" and House Speaker John Boehner called it ""an embarrassment,"" given that Russia and China were forging ahead on comparable pipelines, leaving America in the dust.But in Obama's statement, his idea was to make you think his veto had nothing to do with his not wanting the pipeline, which he made abundantly clear over the past six years of his presidency.Nor could it have anything to do with his obeisance to his rich environmental bundlers and fundraisers who also don't want the pipeline, nothing to see there, move along.Nor would it have anything to do with his relentless hostility to Canada, which has a conservative government, a pro-free market agenda, and the usual economic boom that goes with that, making Obama's U.S. economy look scabrous by comparison.These are all realistic explanations that reveal the venal reasons behind his outrageous veto on one of the biggest no-brainers to come across his desk from Congress — the jobs, energy security, reliable supply, increased safety and the enhanced ties with Canada that are part and parcel of the Keystone XL pipeline.What's more, the American people want it.A January poll of 1,011 U.S. residents by CNN/ORC showed that a solid majority — 57% — supported building the pipeline, with support even higher in the Midwest and South (which might just be important for Obama's party in the 2016 election).Constructing this pipeline would not only provide at least 4,000 jobs for Americans and tens of thousands more in the economic downstream as the oil boom hits towns across America's heartland, it would also help secure America's and Canada's places as the new global energy powerhouses and bring prosperity to thousands of unemployed Americans.But what are the people's interests and America's energy security, not to mention the hundreds of elected members of Congress who voted for this, compared to Obama's claimed reasons?Far easier to just say no, make it look like a question of more studies and red tape needed, and, above all, blame Republicans.As a result, not only will thousands of Americans remain unemployed in the heartland, more Americans will die as energy continues to be dangerously transported by train, raising the possibilities of fiery crashes.In just the last year, West Virginia, North Dakota and Quebec suffered such deadly explosions — explosions a pipeline would have prevented.It's the triumph of politics over the national interest.Congress should do all it can to override the veto, because it's the only way to hold Obama responsible for what he's trying to slink away from.

Because the Mrs. is seeking the presidency, the Clintons' family foundation has changed its policy on accepting millions of dollars in donations from foreign governments.It seems many worry that foreign governments might just maybe possibly be seeking favorable treatment from another Clinton administration through the back door -- if you can imagine such a thing from the people who brought you Whitewater, Travelgate, Monica, Emailgate and more. And remember the Lincoln Bedroom business, where Clinton guests overnighted and then later, coincidentally, happened to donate to Clinton causes?But like so much of what this trio has pulled off during its long, controversial, tawdry run in American public life, the policy 'change' depends on what your definition of 'change' is.The foundation board (yes, Bill and Chelsea are on it) will halt some foreign government donations. But not all. They'll keep others. But not all. And those newly-banned from donating to one part of the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation can still donate to a subsidiary, the Clinton Global Initiative.Because for the Clintons, you understand, it's not about them or their money; it's about helping the world.In short, the policy change is very Clintonian, meaning it's meant to look legal and transparent but actually obscures and deceives. And maybe you believe that Hillary, the ex-secretary of State and now White House candidate, is clueless about where the foreign millions originate and whose calls to take.Remember President Clinton's Clintonian testimony to the independent counsel investigating the lie about his Monica Lewinsky affair? ""It depends on what the meaning of the word 'is' is. If the—if he—if 'is' means is and never has been, that is not—that is one thing. If it means there is none, that was a completely true statement.""Got that?Right. Same just as clearly goes for this week's Clinton foundation changes.So, the foundation will in future accept donations only from six foreign countries. They are Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, Germany and the Netherlands. Also Norway.Because who could possibly object to these white-hat countries, right?If, let's just say hypothetically, Canada gave a couple million dollars to the Clinton family foundation, only a royal cynic would suspect that might possibly perhaps theoretically help persuade someone somewhere in the U.S. government to finally approve the Keystone XL pipeline to carry Canadian oil across the Heartland to Texas.Everybody else can no longer donate -- unless they already are donating as part of ongoing annual gifts. Or want to increase them. That would be OK. From other countries. Because who would want to interrupt such help for millions of poor people elsewhere?Also, officials from any government can attend and participate in any foundation programs anywhere and will be ""allowed"" to pay $20,000 admission for the privilege. That's just lunch money on Planet Clinton.RELATED:Hillary sees a need to curb free speech rights (of others)Hillary Clinton 'wants' to be the president, but hasn't said why?

104,XL,"Stimulus: Obama says jobs from the Keystone project aren't permanent and it's just one pipeline that will move foreign oil to foreign markets. But fixing the bridge he once used as a prop didn't create permanent jobs either.'Let's set our sights above a single pipeline,"" the leader of the party of infrastructure told Congress in the State of the Union. But this Congress has 80 more Republicans than when he took office, and on Thursday the Senate rejected his admonition by a 62-36 vote.Eight Democrats crossed the aisle after a series of amendment votes, a process that had vanished under former Majority Leader Harry Reid. While not approved with a veto-proof majority, the Keystone bill, after House approval, will head to Obama's desk, where stopping the pipeline will finally put the onus on him and him alone.The president wants a bill that fixes the nation's bridges and roads — legislation he touted when he spoke last July with the Interstate 495 bridge over the Christina River near Wilmington, Del., as a backdrop. The bridge had been closed for emergency repairs after the discovery of four tilting support columns. Yet Obama didn't make the argument it was just one bridge or that the jobs fixing it wouldn't be permanent.Yes, Keystone is just one pipeline. But its 1,700 miles would join the more than 50,000 miles of existing pipelines crisscrossing the U.S., including one already carrying crude from Canada. When those building the pipeline finish it, they'll just move on to other pipelines and projects, like people who finish a bridge or road move on to other bridges and roads.Keystone XL would bring up to 830,000 barrels of oil per day and directly create 20,000 truly shovel-ready jobs. And it would carry not only Canadian oil, but also oil from the Bakken shale formation of North Dakota.Even if it carried only Canadian oil to foreign markets, it and the Gulf Coast refineries that would process the oil would be operated not by robots but by American workers. Would President Obama rather live in a world dependent on oil from North America or on oil from the Middle East and OPEC?Most of the Bakken crude is now carried to market via far more dangerous shipments by BNSF Railway Co., which has more than 1,000 miles of tracks in the region. BNSF was bought by Obama's favorite one-percenter, Warren Buffett, in 2010.The Keystone XL bill should arrive on the president's desk just as the State Department receives final comments on the proposed Canada-to-Texas project. Agencies are required to send their recommendations to the State Department by Feb. 2, another step in the seemingly endless six-year review of the project. We have fought and won wars in less time.As the Heritage Foundation notes, an earlier approval by Hillary Clinton's State Department concluded that:""The pipeline posed minimal environmental risk to soil, wetlands, water resources, vegetation, fish and wildlife, and creates few greenhouse-gas emissions. Keystone XL also met 57 specific pipeline safety-standard requirements created by the State Department and the Department of Transportation's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration.""The State Department has also concluded that not building Keystone will not accomplish anything environmentally, since the crude will still be extracted from Alberta's oil sands and simply shipped by another route, as Canada is already planning to do.Obama's opposition is about presidential ego and ideology more than about environmental safety or jobs or even infrastructure. We don't know if enough votes can be mustered to override a veto. But we do know there's another election in 2016. Thankfully, this president's job isn't permanent.What do you think, Hillary?
"
105,XL," The Obama administration’s decision to reverse course and withdraw a proposal to allow oil and natural gas drilling off the southeast Atlantic coast is more about the president’s future than the country’s. The decision comes as President Obama tries to “build an ambitious environmental legacy” for himself, as the New York Times describes it.We’ve seen this story before. Obama is determined to be remembered as the president who passed comprehensive health care reform, no matter how many Americans lose their doctor and coverage and are forced to pay much higher premiums. He is determined to be remembered as the president who signed a deal with Iran, no matter how many times that country publicly and flagrantly violates the agreement. And he is the president who wants to be remembered as a green warrior, no matter how that action affects U.S. security and energy independence, the trade deficit, and the loss of high-paying jobs.In January 2015, the Obama administration released a “Draft Proposed Program” (DPP)  for expanding offshore oil and natural gas drilling leases in Alaska, the Gulf of Mexico and in the mid- and south Atlantic. Of course, environmentalists were outraged.But now, a year later, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) has apparently changed its mind: “After a robust public comment process, the Mid- and South Atlantic Program Area lease sale proposed for 2021 in the DPP has been removed from the Proposed Program for a number of reasons, including strong local opposition, conflicts with other ocean uses, and current market dynamics.”The BOEM did receive complaints from some coastal communities concerned that a Deepwater Horizon-type oil spill might affect their coasts and economies. But many prominent elected officials from all four of the affected states -- Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia -- also supported the plan because the drilling would provide jobs and royalties for their states.The fact is that large spills are extremely rare, and the industry has since adopted numerous additional safeguards. Plus the proposed Atlantic drilling area has a minimum 50-mile buffer zone from the coast -- Deepwater was about 40 miles out.The BOEM also mentions commercial and military “conflicts.” But commercial and military interests are also present in the Gulf of Mexico, and energy companies have been drilling there for decades. Yet BOEM is willing to expand leases there. Given that the Atlantic rigs would be scattered over more than 100 million acres of open water, and the Department of Defense’s limited objections, it’s hard to see why a workable compromise couldn’t be reached -- just use the Gulf as a model.Finally, the agency’s comment about “market dynamics” refers to the current global oil glut that has depressed oil and natural gas prices and resulted in many U.S. energy companies scaling back capital spending. Given that offshore drilling usually costs more and involves significantly longer lead times than onshore plays, companies may not be rushing to add to the glut -- at least immediately.But the BOEM’s time frame for a lease sale was not until 2021. A lot can change in the energy markets and the global economy between now and then. Offshore rigs don’t appear on location overnight. It can take years, not to mention billions of dollars, for energy companies to go from signing a lease to full production in the off-shore arena.Energy prices are cyclical, and in a few years oil may be approaching $100 a barrel again. Plus the U.S. has begun exporting both oil and natural gas to other countries. If those exports expand quickly -- especially since many countries dependent on Russian natural gas would prefer ours -- companies could soon be scrambling to produce more. Those exports would help lower the trade deficit and create greater energy security for the U.S. and our allies.In short, the Obama administration’s reasons for reneging on is initial proposal are weak and politically suspect, just as the president’s decision to reject the Keystone XL pipeline. In that case, the State Department, which had to assess any potential environmental impact, green-lighted the Canada-to-Nebraska pipeline -- more than once. Yet Obama rejected it, too, a decision that cost thousands of high-paying mostly blue-collar jobs.The Obama administration’s reversal from its original lease proposal was another disappointment from a president who has had a long string of policy disappointments. Like his health care and Iranian nuclear legacies, the president wants a green legacy, and he’s willing to make the country pay any price to get it.

106,XL,"Millions of Indonesians will gain access to the Internet if Alphabet (GOOGL) can follow through with plans to put large balloons high in the sky as part of its Project Loon program.Like Alphabet, Facebook (FB) is also working on plans to bring Internet services to large swaths of people in places where it’s hard to connect fiber-optic cable. Instead of balloons, Facebook is experimenting with large drones flying at high altitudes.Neither project is expected to easily fly over friendly skies. Alphabet’s Project Loon has faced opposition from Indonesia’s largest telecom company while Facebook’s Free Basics plan, which currently provides free Internet service in India, was thwarted by Indian regulators.Project Loon was first announced by Google about four years ago. The idea is to put a network of balloons traveling near the edge of space, designed to provide Internet coverage for people in rural and remote areas. Google has tested the concept with test flights across jungles, mountains and plains. It started with a trial of about 30 balloons over New Zealand. Trials also have been held over Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Australia, Brazil, France and elsewhere.The first commercial implementation is set for later this year over Indonesia. Agreements are in place with three mobile network operators, Indosat, Telkomsel and XL Axiata, as partners for the service. Telekomunikasi Indonesia, the largest telecommunication services company in Indonesia, in comments last October said the plan could harm local telecommunications providers. Alphabet has said it would work with Indonesian companies to develop a business model that works with the country’s law.About 2 in 3 of Indonesia’s 250 million residents do not have Internet access, Alphabet says. That’s largely because stringing fiber networks or installing mobile phone towers across the more than 17,000 islands that make up Indonesia is a significant challenge. Through balloon-to-balloon communication, Project Loon can receive and transmit wireless signals to even the most remote islands.The balloons are about 50 feet in diameter and soar at an altitude about twice that of other aircraft. Electronic gear and solar panels hanging with the balloons include an altitude control system. The balloons can then be programmed to rise or fall in order to catch stratospheric winds that can position the balloons at the right locations.Facebook, through its Free Basics service, provides free but limited Internet service on mobile devices. The service is available to about 1 billion people across Asia, Africa and Latin America, designed to “bring more people online and help improve their lives,” Facebook says. It’s part of Facebook’s Internet.org initiative that has provided Internet access to 19 million people in 38 countries.Last week, India’s Telecom Regulatory Authority ruled against differential pricing for Internet service, thwarting the idea for Facebook’s Free Basics and other similar services. Entrepreneurs in India had criticized the service, saying it positioned Facebook as a gatekeeper to the Web and that they feared being left at a competitive disadvantage.

108,XL,"It might have been the biggest jaw-dropping moment during the State of the Union address. ""We've cut our imports of foreign oil by nearly 60%, and cut carbon pollution more than any other country on Earth,"" President Obama proclaimed. ""Gas under two bucks a gallon ain't bad, either.""Sure, Mr. President. Take a bow for the smashing success of the domestic oil and gas industry you have tried to destroy.But even Obama couldn't carry this one off. The smirk on his face as he sang the praises of an oil and gas industry was unmistakable. This is the man who just two months ago pledged to his pals in the multibillion-dollar climate-change industry that he is committed to shutting down American fossil fuel production.Right after he boasted of these low gas prices, the president reverted back to form:""We've got to accelerate the transition away from dirty energy"" — by which he means fossil fuels. Then the hammer came down: ""I'm going to push to change the way we manage our oil and coal resources, so that they better reflect the costs they impose on taxpayers and our planet.""So 30 seconds after toasting lower gas prices he pledges to find ways to make gas more expensive.Climate Change FanaticThe irony of Obama's war against fossil fuels is that America's shale oil and gas revolution has saved him.During his first term, all the net new jobs created in the U.S. came from oil and gas as fracking took off in Texas, Oklahoma, North Dakota, West Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania. Obama owed his reelection to the frackers, but instead he and his EPA have tried to shut them down.The EPA has issued three regulations in the last year — a clean power plant rule, a methane rule and tougher clean air statutes — that have begun to shut down fossil-fuel production as planned. Arch Coal has filed for bankruptcy, thanks to Obama's climate-change fanaticism.How bad are these rules? According to Harold Hamm of Continental Resources, a major driller in North Dakota: ""These rules and red tape are killing us. They are raising our costs at a time when oil prices are low and margins are already thin. This means layoffs of workers.""Obama seems to be doing exactly what the Saudi oil sheiks are trying to achieve: shut down fracking in America.Meanwhile, Obama won't allow drilling on federal lands or give the go-ahead to the Keystone XL pipeline or any other pipelines. Instead, he wants to raise taxes on oil and gas production and just handed out hundreds of millions of dollars to keep the solar and wind industries from bankruptcy. Other than that, he's pro oil and gas.Cleaned By FreedomThe president also neglected to mention that the major reason why carbon emissions are falling is that cheap and clean-burning natural gas from shale drilling is becoming America's No. 1 source of electricity production. The lesson: free markets and innovation are almost always the best way to clean the environment.If Obama's vision of an American energy future is fulfilled, the price of oil and gas will skyrocket — again. He'd like that to happen because wind and solar companies privately concede it's the only scenario that makes green energy financially feasible.Raising the cost of energy — and particularly gas prices at the pump — will be a gut punch to consumers. Motorists are saving about $500 a year from these lower gas prices. It's one of the few positive trends in an otherwise limping economy.One last point about low gas prices. Why when oil prices rise is the entire industry accused of price-fixing to gouge consumers? And if the industry has the monopolistic power to keep prices as high as possible, why isn't it doing that now?The answer is that in the new era of shale oil and gas the industry is brutally price-competitive — unlike in the past when the OPEC was able to fix prices. The cartel can no longer manipulate prices because the U.S. will soon be the world's largest producer. All the more reason to let the domestic oil and gas industry flourish.For now, however, Obama will hog the credit for lower gas prices that he never wanted in the first place while he finds every way possible to make gas more expensive in the years to come.• Moore is a Fox News contributor and a member of the IBD Brain Trust.

120,XL,"Energy: A few weeks ago, when gasoline prices were closer to their recent bottom, President Obama told the American people, ""You're welcome."" Will he apologize now that prices are going back up?While speaking at Ivy Tech Community College in Indianapolis on Feb. 6, Obama claimed credit for lower pump prices.""We're as free of foreign oil as we've been in 30 years,"" he reported. ""We've doubled the amount of clean energy that we're producing. A lot of families are saving a lot of money at the gas pump, which is putting some smiles on folks' faces.""Then, the most anti-oil president in history told the appreciative crowd of low-information admirers: ""You're welcome.""On the day Obama delivered that speech, the national average for regular gasoline was $2.17 a gallon, up from a low in late December of just over $2, which was the lowest since 2009. (For the record, a gallon cost a mere $1.85 on the day Obama was inaugurated in January 2009.)But as of Wednesday, the price was back up to $2.33, according to the American Automobile Association's Fuel Gauge Report. Prices have now increased every day for more than four weeks.The fact is, Obama had nothing to do with the drop in gasoline prices. But he does have a role in their re-ascension.It was back in 2006, when Obama was just a senator, that he insisted the country ""can't drill away its energy problem."" In fact, while campaigning for president two years later, he said he preferred a ""gradual adjustment"" toward higher gasoline prices. And he again said higher pump prices are ""one emergency we can't drill our way out of.""Candidate Obama also asserted that ""there's nothing that can be done"" about rising gas prices.As president, Obama has obstructed oil recovery whenever and wherever he could. He has virtually blocked new offshore drilling, positioned his administration to put 12 million acres of the crude-rich Arctic National Wildlife Refuge off limits, delayed and then finally vetoed the Keystone XL oil pipeline, hired an energy secretary — Steven Chu — who favored $8-a-gallon gasoline, and used taxpayers' dollars to fund failed renewable energy schemes.His administration has even been held in contempt of court when it refused to issue drilling permits in the Gulf of Mexico.But Obama hasn't been able to stop the fracking revolution on private lands. A bogeyman to the political left, fracking has helped the U.S. increase domestic supplies 50% in five years.Fracking has also helped slash gas prices, created jobs and kept the economy from lapsing into recession. As IBD Brain Truster Stephen Moore has calculated: ""From 2008 to 2013, the oil and gas industry created more jobs on net than all other industries combined.""The president's liberal constituency may not like it, but the United States is an oil-producing machine, and all of us are beneficiaries. Just don't include Barack Obama among our benefactors.

I’m also honored to have served this past year as leader of the Senate’s new Republican majority.When you voted for this new majority last November, the Senate was a mess. Some thought the Senate could never be cured of its dysfunction and its gridlock.But the new majority you elected didn’t agree. We believed the Senate could be restored to a place of high purpose again, and we’ve made great strides over the past year proving that it can. (Scroll down for video of these remarks.)Here’s how we did it:We got committees working again, just like we promised.We opened up the legislative process, just like we promised.We gave Senators of both parties more of a say, and it opened a floodgate of legislative accomplishments and good ideas.We passed a balanced budget, for the first time since 2001.We reformed No Child Left Behind and its Common Core mandates—replacing a broken law with the most significant K-12 education reform in more than a dozen years.We addressed America’s crumbling roads and bridges—passing the first long-term transportation bill in a decade.At a time of economic uncertainty, we passed permanent tax relief for families and small businesses. We voted to empower job creation by doing things like lift a 40-year ban on energy exports and an act to measure that can help knock down foreign trade barriers.At a time of diverse global threats, we voted to enact significant military acquisition reform and to provide more of the funding needed to modernize our armed forces. We voted to help those who’ve suffered from the VA scandal and to give our troops the support they need to better confront threats like ISIL.We passed legislation to help protect your personal financial information from cyber-attackers. We made important reforms to help improve the viability of programs you look to in retirement, like Medicare.We worked together to extend a hand of compassion to wounded veterans and to bring a ray of hope to victims of human trafficking and modern slavery. And when it came to some of Washington’s artificial cliffs and manufactured dramas, we were able to pass real, permanent solutions instead of more temporary patches.These are just a few of the measures the new Senate has passed this year.Many issues had languished in the old Senate for years. Some were assumed to be too difficult for any Senate majority to address.But the Republican Senate you elected, working with the men and women who stand up for you in the House of Representatives, tackled each of them—and the President signed most into law.Of course there are other bills he didn’t or won’t sign. Like the one we passed to repeal a health law that attacks the Middle Class: ObamaCare.Or the ones we passed to protect coal families, or to approve the Keystone XL pipeline.It’s true that a new President will be required to notch wins like those for the Middle Class.But the Republican Senate majority is proving that you can still get a lot done with a President from a different party. We’re proving you can actually enact significant, long-term reforms—achieve conservative policy goals—and get them signed into law.That’s good for the Senate. Most importantly, it’s good for our country.I’m proud of what the new Republican majority has accomplished in such a short time. We’re not only putting the Senate back to work, we’re putting it back to work on your side.Just like you asked. Just like we promised.Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays to you and your family, and to all of our brave armed services stationed abroad around the world. ####Previous weekly party remarks are available here.RELATED:

132,XL,"Energy: Three million gallons of Bakken crude burning in rural West Virginia after an oil train derails in a snowstorm ought to underscore the environmental safety of replacing rail cars with the Keystone XL pipeline.One of the reasons President Obama says he'll veto the Keystone pipeline bill that, as a result of last November's GOP electoral gusher, has found its way to his desk is that it will only carry Canadian crude to foreign markets and is not worth jeopardizing the environment.Two things are wrong with that argument.The first is that Keystone XL will also bring Bakken crude to the American market, accelerating the oil boom from fracking in the shale formation centered on North Dakota. This will make North America energy independent and the rest of the world less dependent on Middle Eastern oil, a matter of no small significance.Second, as the State Department's multiple reviews point out, the Keystone XL pipeline itself poses no serious risk to the environment, no more than the tens of thousands of miles of pipeline that already crisscross the U.S., including one from Canada, all operating quite safely.As the Heritage Foundation notes, an earlier approval by Hillary Clinton's State Department concluded: ""The pipeline posed minimal environmental risk to soil, wetlands, water resources, vegetation, fish and wildlife, and creates few greenhouse-gas emissions. Keystone XL also met 57 specific pipeline safety-standard requirements created by the State Department and the Department of Transportation's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration.""The State Department has also concluded that by not building Keystone we will accomplish nothing environmentally, since the crude will still be extracted from Alberta's oil sands and simply shipped by another route, as Canada is already planning to do.So even if Obama vetoes the Keystone XL bill and the veto is not overridden, both Bakken and Canadian crude will find their way to market.The only thing the president would accomplish would be to, er, derail a pipeline that would bring up to 830,000 barrels of oil per day to our Gulf Coast refineries and directly create 20,000 truly shovel-ready jobs.The train that derailed about 30 miles outside of Charleston, W.Va., was carrying Bakken crude from North Dakota. In addition to the explosions and fire, at least one tanker found its way into a nearby Kanawha River tributary. Two water treatment plants had to be closed. Hundreds of families were evacuated, but property damage was minimal thanks to the relatively remote location of the derailment.As more oil flows out of North Dakota, more of these accidents and potential catastrophes will happen. Two days before the West Virginia wreck, 29 cars of a 100-car Canadian National Railway train carrying Bakken crude derailed about 50 miles south of Timmins, Ontario, spilling oil and catching fire.A little more than a year ago, Casselton, N.D., had a near-brush with tragedy after a train of tank cars carrying crude oil derailed, resulting in fiery explosions and a call from the town's mayor for a re-examination of how such fuel is transported across the United States.Rail shipments of crude have increased from 9,500 carloads in 2008 to more than 435,000 in 2013, driven largely by the Bakken boom. Limited pipeline capacity in the region forces more than 70% of the crude to be shipped to the refineries by rail, increasing the dangers.There doesn't seem too much of a debate that pipelines are safer than rail shipments. The right-leaning Manhattan Institute says trains spill 33 times more oil than pipelines, while the left-leaning Brookings Institution says the evidence that railroads are far less safe than pipelines is ""overwhelming.""So is the evidence of the economic need for the Keystone XL pipeline. Sign the bill, Mr. President.

144,XL,"Energy: President Obama has junked the Keystone XL pipeline. His stated reason: The U.S. needs to lead the ""serious action to fight climate change."" His real reason is different.'America,"" Obama said, is ""now a global leader"" in the climate war, ""and frankly, approving this project would have undercut that global leadership.""He insists now is the time to ""protect the one planet we've got while we still can."" Though his rhetoric will resonate with those who want to hear that sort of bunkum, the rest of us recognize its vast emptiness.Obama's decision Friday was based on nothing more than political opportunity. The announcement was timed to coincide with the United Nations climate talks, which begin in Paris at the end of the month, and shaped to make him look like a strong leader.As usual, it was all about Obama, who craves the international approval and domestic back-pats he will get for being such a forward thinker.But here's what we have learned through almost seven years of his presidency — when it's all about Obama, the rest of us generally get a boot to the head. In the instance of his Keystone decision, we're talking lost jobs and energy prices that will be higher than they should be.Let's start with jobs. TransCanada, the company that was to build the Keystone XL pipeline connecting the oil fields of Alberta, Canada, with the crude refineries on our Gulf coast, says ""the $8 billion project will create 9,000 well-paying construction jobs.""If that estimate seems too self-serving, consider that in its Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement, the State Department said in March that more than 40,000 jobs would be spun off from the project during construction.Would some — maybe even many — of the jobs be temporary? Yes, that's the nature of construction jobs. But two points on this:One, temporary work is better than no work. And two, the president and his party have been screaming now for some time about the country's need to ""invest"" in more infrastructure projects because of the jobs they provide. Evidently infrastructure that carries a commodity that the political left detests doesn't count.Now we move on to energy prices. Can anyone honestly say that more crude pouring into the country won't push down our gasoline prices? Robert Bradley, CEO of the Institute for Energy Research, assured us four years ago in Forbes that ""a new influx of up to 700,000"" barrels per day ""from Canada will dramatically increase U.S. supplies, and in turn drive gas prices down.""Of course, lower gasoline prices are not what the environmentalists that support Obama and the Democrats want. They want high gasoline prices so less is burned.They have a long history of pointing to the high prices in Europe and saying that Americans should be dealing with the same pain.And it's not just gasoline prices. Obama made it a goal to push the cost of burning coal in power plants so high that they will go bankrupt.America is now a global leader, all right — in a costly fight against an imaginary enemy.

146,XL,"Energy: President Obama says he's taking every step to thwart the Islamic State terrorism threat. Alas, that isn't so. We can and should drill our vast oil and gas resources to reduce petro-dollar funding of ISIS.But for this administration — hyper-obsessed as it is with its crusade against fossil fuels — fighting a war against terrorism remains a distant second priority.The dollars ISIS uses to buy arms, train terrorists, make bombs and build a network of murderous operatives around the world come from Middle East oil.Every credible news agency and intelligence report tells us they are able to wreak world havoc because they have as much as $50 million of oil money flowing in each month.One obvious way to disrupt those now threatening to launch Paris-like attacks in London, Washington, D.C., New York and elsewhere is to produce more oil right here in the U.S. — depriving terrorists in the Mideast of a major part of their revenue stream.We now have an economic and national security case for shale oil and gas drilling and for using our vast coal resources. As such, to support domestic energy production so we don't have to finance those who are trying to kill us is, well, patriotic.With a pro-drilling policy, the U.S. can be a net exporter of oil and natural gas within five years or so.Technological leaps forward have given us more energy production capacity than any other nation in the world. We can easily replace OPEC and Russia.But Obama is doing all he can to stop U.S. production, and he recently declared that we need to keep our energy resources ""in the ground.""If anti-energy decisions — such as the ban on oil and gas exports and Obama's recent rejection of the Keystone XL pipeline — were reversed, domestic production could easily double.Domestic drilling alone won't destroy ISIS, but it's a simple and obvious step that will incapacitate our sworn enemies and help our domestic economy at the same time.After the events of last week and the latest ISIS warnings of attacks to come in the U.S., if Obama won't make domestic energy independence a high priority, he isn't taking the terrorist threat nearly as serious as he claims.

156,XL,"After years of review, President Obama has killed the Keystone XL pipeline project, which would have moved crude oil from Western Canada to Nebraska, where it would have connected to existing pipelines and moved the oil to refineries at the U.S. Gulf Coast.

"
157,XL,"Energy: With gas prices continuing to drop in many markets, Americans are seeing first-hand the dividend from the shale oil and gas revolution. But this good news has only intensified the left's crusade against fossil fuels.The latest scheme by the greens to sabotage domestic oil and gas production is to prevent the building of pipelines, not just Keystone XL, but a network of thousands of miles of pipelines needed to get our bountiful energy resources to market.Keystone XL gets all the headlines, but the Wall Street Journal reports that environmental groups have delayed about a dozen other pipeline projects. These groups are holding ""training"" sessions to teach activists how to hold up pipeline projects with protests, bogus legal challenges, local ordinances and even throwing their bodies in front of the bulldozers.These pipelines, which would carry millions of barrels of oil and massive amounts of natural gas, would crisscross throughout North America — Alaska, Alberta, New York, Pennsylvania, Minnesota, Nebraska, North Dakota and Wisconsin.Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida has noted that just as President Eisenhower built the interstate highway system in the 1950s, America now needs a national network of pipelines. And these are the very kinds of ""shovel ready"" infrastructure projects President Obama says we need for jobs.Unlike the make-work and often-misdirected public works projects on which his administration wants to spend $100 billion of taxpayer money, these 10,000 miles of pipelines will be built with private money, so they don't cost government a dime. We're talking about potentially hundreds of thousands of jobs and tens of billions of dollars of private spending.What's not to like? Those on the left say they're opposing pipelines because of pollution and potential leakage into water supplies. But that's clearly disingenuous. The chart shows that pipelines are much more efficient and less accident-prone in shipping oil and gas than trucks or railroad cars or ships. That's a lesson that has hit home with recent oil-car derailments.Meanwhile, in energy-drilling hot spots such as North Dakota and Texas, natural gas is burned off with flares because there aren't pipelines to transport the gas cheaply so it can be used to produce electricity, run factories and heat homes. Since when is it ""green"" to waste a resource?The fact is, pipelines aren't just good for the economy and jobs. They're beneficial to the environment as well. But the war against them isn't really about preventing leakages or spills. It's the latest tactic by radical leftists to stop America's energy revolution.They use the same tactics to stop coal trains and close down coal plants, and the same tactics to stop liquefied natural gas terminals necessary to export our vast natural gas resources.They aren't for infrastructure. They aren't for jobs. They aren't for energy independence or low gas prices. Democrats, alas, are too tethered to the extremists in the green movement to stand up to these no-nothing radicals.This is another opportunity for Republicans to take their message to blue-collar union halls that Big Green is costing America high-paying union jobs and making America poorer.

158,XL,"Gov. Mary Fallin gives the Republican Party's Weekly RemarksGood morning, I’m Mary Fallin, governor of the great state of Oklahoma. And today, like most Americans, I’m urging President Obama to approve the Keystone XL pipeline.With this project, we have the opportunity to support at least 42,000 jobs in our country, and that’s according to the president’s own State Department. Not only that, we can secure the safest, most cost-effective way to transport these resources. And we can continue building our energy future and reducing our dependence on foreign oil. (Scroll down for a video of these remarks.)Keystone has now been through more than six years of scrutiny — far more than any project of its kind — and it’s passed every test and cleared every hurdle. But still, the president just drags his feet.The good news now is, members of both parties in Congress have come together to pass a bill giving Keystone the green light.Today I’d like to share with you a story to help illustrate why President Obama should sign it.You see, here in Oklahoma, we have the part of this pipeline that’s already been approved. It’s the Gulf Coast portion that runs from Cushing, Oklahoma south into Texas.This one portion of the pipeline is on track to generate over $15 million annually in tax revenue for Oklahoma. That's a big boost for our state, with 85 percent of that money going to our public schools. If the whole project is approved, the volume of oil flowing through Oklahoma would increase by 75 percent. That’s a steady, reliable source of revenue coming in for the foreseeable future.The construction of this pipeline has helped fuel our state’s economic comeback. The project had two main construction bases — one in Prague and one in Atoka. These are small towns, populations of no more than a few thousand people or so. Having about 1,000 workers based out of these camps was a great source of economic development for those communities. And at its peak, about 4,000 workers were part of the construction of the Gulf Coast pipeline. That’s some 12 million man-hours of labor.And even now, after construction, the pipeline continues to bring jobs and opportunities into Oklahoma. Statewide, since 2010, Oklahoma has seen a 44 percent jump in pipeline transportation and construction jobs.Remember, this is all from ONE part of ONE pipeline in ONE state. Just think of what we could achieve if this whole project were allowed to go forward.Now I know these are a lot of numbers — especially for a Saturday morning — but behind each one is a story of its own: a worker who now has a job, who now has insurance, who can put food on the table, who can plan and hope for the future.Out here, that’s what Keystone is about. Not politics, not Republicans and Democrats. It’s about jobs. It’s about energy. It’s about infrastructure. It’s about hope.President Obama was once about that too. That’s why I’m appealing to him to do the right thing, sign this bill, let us finally build this pipeline. Let us get our people working.Thank you for listening, and of course, Happy Valentine’s Day. ####Previous weekly remarks from both parties are available here.RELATED:Hillary's poll numbers collapseStages set for 2016 conventions.

159,XL,"Fiscal Policy: President Reagan's annual budgets and their spending cuts were always derided as ""DOA: dead on arrival."" President Obama's latest spending plan may be the first to be stamped ""DBA: dead before arrival.""But that's good news, because his $4 trillion blueprint, the broad details of which were revealed during his State of the Union address, isn't so much a spending and tax plan as a grandiose political/social statement about where this president wants to take the nation: even further left.The thinking behind this wish list of new taxes and spending is that government — not private businesses, entrepreneurs, workers and employers — is the primary springboard of growth. It reflects the philosophy of a president who tells America's great companies and small-business men and women: ""You didn't build that.""The plan would lift spending by $74 billion over the spending caps the president himself invented back in 2011. To entice Republicans to go along, he's offering $35 billion more for the military.Over five years his budget would spend almost $350 billion over the self-imposed caps — which are the main reason the deficit has been falling in recent years.The era of big government would be back with a vengeance. Obama wants a preposterous 7% spending hike this year for government agencies — with more nanny-state money for schools, early-childhood education, roads and bridges, child care, green energy and corporate welfare for manufacturers.He calls this bloat ""middle-class economics."" But when was the last time American families who'll have to pay for all this had a 7% pay raise? The debt would rise an additional $5 trillion over the next decade and would never get within even a half-trillion of balance.Obama's tax scheme would raise the capital gains and dividend taxes to 28% and impose new taxes on inheritances. Mr. President, this rise in investment taxes will mean less investment, not more.Entitlement spending would be left on autopilot and nearly double by 2016. A $478 billion infrastructure fund would be created to help finance projects such as California's $68 billion high-speed rail project to nowhere. But of course Obama opposes privately funded infrastructure such as the Keystone XL pipeline.To fund the orgy of public works projects, he wants yet another new tax — a 14% levy imposed on profits parked outside the country. This won't raise much money.But it will ensure that most multinationals are foreign-owned, not American. Under the president's plan, a firm in Ireland or Germany or China would pay roughly 14% less tax on profits on overseas operations. This is a head start program for countries we compete against.Everything voters said in November that they want less of, this budget would provide more. Sadly, Rep. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, the top Democrat on the House Budget Committee, said Sunday that the plan ""will have broad and deep support from Democrats.""The broad strategy here is to take $500 billion from the wealthiest Americans and redistribute it to everyone else. The government already spends $1 trillion a year on welfare programs that are supposed to do that.But income redistribution is not an economic strategy. Republicans should counter with a budget that focuses on growth, jobs and doing what every family in America must do: balance its books.
"
160,XL,"Rep. Lynn Jenkins gives the Republican Party's Weekly RemarksGood morning. I’m Lynn Jenkins, Congresswoman from the Second District of Kansas and Vice-Chair of the House Republican Conference.This is the time of year when high school seniors are putting the final touches on their college applications. That means it’s also the time when families are preparing to start paying for that education — whether it’s a 4-year college, community college, or a technical school. (Scroll down for video of these remarks.)As a parent with two children in college, I know this can be one of the most rewarding, and at the same time challenging, aspects of being a parent — particularly at a time when costs are going up while wages stay about the same. All told, Americans now owe more than $1 trillion in student loan debt.And so in the new Congress, Republicans are working to lower costs for middle-class families and empower folks with bottom-up solutions that help prepare you for the future.That’s why, this week, I introduced a bipartisan plan to expand popular 529 college savings accounts.As you know, these 529 plans were created to help middle-class families save and plan for college. Many parents open them not long after their children are born. And ever since Congress allowed folks to withdraw from these accounts tax-free for college expenses, 1 million account holders have turned into 12 million.Unfortunately, instead of expanding 529s, the president recently proposed raising taxes on college savings. If implemented his scheme would have turned back the clock on middle-class families, and taken money from your savings to pay for more government. This would have discouraged families from using 529s, meaning less savings, more debt, and more government dependence.It was a terribly misguided idea, but it took a public outcry for the president to realize it. Just days after proposing this tax on 529s, he agreed to drop it from his budget.But with hardworking families struggling, abandoning his proposal is not enough.First, the president should put his full weight behind our plan to expand and strengthen 529 accounts. We can remove common paperwork problems, empower students to use the money to pay for computers, and make it easier for families to send their kids to the college of their choice. Because we should be rewarding people who work hard and play by the rules — not punishing them.Second, the president should reconsider his threats to veto our common-sense jobs bills. We’ve voted to approve the Keystone XL pipeline, which would create 42,000 American jobs. We’re ready to restore the 40-hour workweek so we can get people working full-time again. And we think bureaucrats should have to regulate with more transparency and less cost. That’s just common sense.Expanding opportunity, protecting middle-class savings, holding government accountable: these are your priorities, which means they are Republicans’ priorities.As we saw this week, when the people speak out, government has to listen. Now we need President Obama to keep listening. It’s the best thing he can do for our families and our future. Thank you for listening, and enjoy the Super Bowl. ####Previous weekly remarks from both parties are available here.RELATED:Hillary's poll numbers collapseCan Hillary survive Benghazi?Obama vows vigilance on terrorism, frees more Gitmo prisonersGOP: After 2,300 days of Obama indecision, it's time to act on Keystone

162,XL,"After years of waffling, Hillary Clinton has come out against construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, calling it ""a distraction."" Actually, it's a pander on her part. So much for Clinton's vaunted concern for America's middle class.The Democratic presidential front-runner had refused to give a straight answer about the proposed construction of the mighty oil pipeline from Canada to the Lower 48, despite the fact that her own State Department gave the pipeline a clean bill of health on its environmental impact, and Big Labor enthusiastically endorses the project.When she finally did, she said that ""I think it's imperative to look at the Keystone pipeline as what I think it is, a distraction to the important work we have to do on climate change.""A distraction? In saying ""no"" to Keystone, Clinton revealed herself as willing to pitch the middle class she claims to stand for over the side to please big-money campaign donors who have made Keystone their hobbyhorse.Not only would Keystone create 179,000 American jobs, it would also help provide a more secure source for oil, and keep energy costs low. Lower energy costs and a reliable energy are the top reasons that manufacturing jobs are returning to the U.S. from China.Hillary's ""no"" also goes against the verdict of popular polls, which show that the vast majority of Americans favor the Keystone XL project.And guess what, it even comes at the expense of the environment. For anyone who actually cares about climate change, Clinton's claim that squelching the pipeline will keep the air cleaner is living in la-la land. Canada's shale field oil from up north is already coming here, but not by safe, low-impact pipelines. It's being transported to the states by high-polluting and high-risk rail transport instead of an inconspicuous pipeline. As for the little villages that risk getting blown up in the conflagrations near rail stations, Clinton seems to find them a distraction, too.Meanwhile, for a former secretary of state, Clinton's willingness to alienate top ally Canada and throw a bone to an increasingly aggressive China is more than a little passing strange.Yet all of this is irrelevant to Clinton, given that socialist rival Bernie Sanders is gaining on her in the race for the Democratic nomination, Clinton's stance is simply to ""price match"" Sanders' extremism.Just don't call it principled.

164,XL,"Sen. Lisa Murkowski gives the Republican Party's Weekly RemarksHello. I’m Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. This past week, President Obama, in his State of the Union address, laid out his plans for America. And as part of his speech, he called on Congress to pass an infrastructure bill that will create jobs and make our nation stronger for decades to come.I welcomed that message, and the fact is, we’ve already started. For over two weeks now, the Senate has been working hard on a bipartisan bill to approve the Keystone XL pipeline. This important infrastructure project will support thousands of jobs. It would carry both American and Canadian oil, in the cleanest and safest way, and help keep energy affordable for American families. (Scroll down for video of these remarks.)After more than 2,300 days of presidential indecision, it’s important for us to act. The world is watching to see whether the United States is willing to lead as a global energy superpower that respects its neighbors, trades with its allies, and builds needed infrastructure. I believe we are ready for that role — and our leadership can start with the approval of Keystone XL.The new Republican congress you elected has only been in office a few weeks now, but already we’ve made important strides towards making congress function again and getting Washington back to work. We’re fulfilling the promises made in the recent elections, and considering legislation in an open and a transparent manner where both Republicans and Democrats can offer their ideas.Now, here’s an interesting fact: more amendments were voted on in the Senate just this past week, than were voted on during all of 2014.Our approach to this energy infrastructure bill is one that allows members from both parties — and every state — the chance to have their voices heard.Once Congress approves the Keystone XL pipeline with bipartisan support, we will have an opportunity to put forth additional energy solutions that will grow our economy and help hardworking Americans.We are focusing on energy because it is vital to....

165,XL,"....our prosperity, and a strategic asset that we can use to assist our allies and trading partners. It is in our interest to continue making our energy abundant, affordable, clean, diverse, and secure. And I am confident we can reach those goals by strengthening our supply, modernizing our infrastructure, supporting energy efficiency, and ensuring federal accountability.As Chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, I will do my best to ensure the Senate approves broad energy legislation this year. The last time that happened was in 2007. That was a time of scarcity, but America is now producing more energy than ever before.We’ve seen firsthand that American supply matters to global prices — and the only question now is whether we’re going to take the steps necessary to keep energy affordable.We can start by looking to Alaska, where we have tremendous amounts of oil just waiting to be produced. We have prolific resources in our National Petroleum Reserve and offshore. If we also unlock just a fraction of the non-wilderness portion of ANWR, we could bring about a huge range of economic benefits.Some may consider this controversial, but it really is not. Even the head of the Alaska Democratic Party wrote a piece this week, urged that it be opened. It’s time we embrace the opportunities before us.Republicans have a positive agenda that will help create jobs, keep energy affordable, and increase our security.Over the next two years, it is our hope that President Obama will be a partner in our efforts, and that he will start by finally approving the Keystone XL pipeline. Thank you for listening. ####Previous weekly remarks from both parties are available here.RELATED:FCC ponders routing 911 calls through Russian satellitesWhat's Obama's problem calling radical Islam radical Islam?

167,XL,"Energy: While taking credit for increased oil and gas production on private and state lands, the president moves to put 12 million acres of the oil-rich Arctic National Wildlife Refuge off limits. OPEC and the Saudis are smiling.Whoever's in charge of presidential optics these days fits the classic definition of the blind leading the blind.It's bad enough that President Obama doesn't have time to get to Paris for a global protest against terrorism after the Charlie Hebdo attack but can meet and greet the San Antonio Spurs.But then he privately slams an invitation by Congress to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, our only true ally in a terror-stricken Middle East, with whom he has no time to speak, while he travels to Saudi Arabia to meet with new Saudi King Salman and extend our condolences on the death of King Abdullah.And the way to Riyadh, Obama gives the Saudis a gift in the form of the proposed wilderness designation of three energy-rich areas of Alaska: 1.52 million acres of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge's coastal plain, 5.85 million acres of the Brooks mountain range and 4.92 million acres of the Porcupine Plateau.The proposed designation comes from a president who has taken credit for an oil boom on private and state lands that has driven down oil prices to the point that the Russian economy is cratering and OPEC is hyperventilating.It also comes from the president who in 2012 mocked the ""drill, baby, drill"" mantra of former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin. ""Since it's an election year (Republicans) are already dusting off their three-point plans for $2 gas,"" Obama said, adding that ""we can't just drill our way to lower gas prices.""Well, we could and we did and $2 gas is here — despite a president who restricts domestic oil exploration and production in federal waters and on federal lands, and blocks the Keystone XL pipeline lest North America leave OPEC in the dust and literally pounding sand.Is President Obama worried that fossil fuels, our fossil fuels, are becoming the energy source of the future and that he must — like a King Canute of energy — try to stem waves of them?""Alaska's National Wildlife Refuge is an incredible place — pristine, undisturbed,"" Obama said Sunday. ""It supports caribou and polar bears, all manner of marine life, countless species of birds and fish, and for centuries it supported many Alaska native communities. But it's very fragile.""Fact is, the coastal plain, where the drilling would occur in ANWR, is far from the scenic areas shown in Sierra Club ads. Half the year it's in total darkness, reaching temperatures of 50 below. Spit freezes before it hits the ground. Most of the year it's uninhabited and uninhabitable by wildlife.Nearby Prudhoe Bay has supplied an average of 9%, and as much as 12%, of our daily consumption since oil first flowed southward on June 20, 1977, after critics said it held only a six-month supply and was among the most environmentally sensitive oil operations in the world. Caribou frolic and play by the pipeline, enjoying its warmth as herds have expanded manyfold.The Trans-Alaska pipeline, which at one point carried 2.1 million barrels of oil a day from Prudhoe Bay, now carries well under a million as production has dwindled. If output drops below 300,000 a day, it will have to shut down due to flow requirements.ANWR's coastal plain alone is estimated to hold 28 billion barrels of oil. The Trans-Alaska pipeline needs that additional production, and we do too. So drill, baby, drill, and let the Saudis fend for themselves.

205,XL,"Energy Transport: New data show fast-rising rail shipments from North Dakota's Bakken shale formation and the need for a safer alternative to rail — like the Keystone XL pipeline.In his post-election press conference, the president noted in justifying his continual kicking of the Keystone XL oil drum down the road that ""while this debate about Canadian oil has been raging ... we've seen some of the biggest increases in American oil production and natural gas production in our history.""That increase is due in large part to oil recovered from the Bakken shale formation centered on North Dakota. So much oil has been found there that the Energy Information Administration notes a 13.4% jump in rail shipments of oil over last year, a trend likely to continue.This is both good news and bad news, for increased rail shipments of oil raise the risk of catastrophic train derailments. A State Department analysis released in June found that rejecting the Keystone XL pipeline project would result in 2,947 injuries and 434 deaths as oil companies shipped their oil by means, including rail, that are demonstrably less safe.As we've noted, Keystone would not only carry oil from Canada to U.S. refineries, but also link to the Bakken formation. Many rail shipments from the Bakken fields are being handled by BNSF Railway.The danger of rail shipments from Bakken is heightened by the fact that Bakken crude is more flammable than other crude, according to the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration.""The no-action alternative of rail is a misguided plan,"" former PHMSA head Brigham McCown said in the Washington Free Beacon. ""Pipelines have proved themselves to be safer, more environmentally friendly and more cost effective than the alternative.""Environmentalists claim the Keystone pipeline from Canada represents an unprecedented environmental threat. But Keystone poses no greater danger than the more than 50,000 existing miles of safely operating pipeline already crisscrossing the U.S.The right-leaning Manhattan Institute says trains spill 33 times more oil than pipelines, and the left-leaning Brookings Institution says the evidence that railroads are far less safe than pipelines is ""overwhelming.""Keystone not only means jobs, lower energy prices and economic growth, it also means more safety and security for the American people.

233,XL,"President Obama will deliver yet another State of the Union Address with much the same message and policy prescription of his first six: Spread the wealth around. He wants $320 billion in new taxes on both the middle class and wealthy over the next decade to pay for income redistribution handout programs that are supposed to help the poor and middle class.
"
234,XL,"But Obama has been president now for six years. If his redistribution policies worked, why are the poor getting poorer and why has the middle class stalled out? Is this George Bush's fault?
"
235,XL,"The irony of the Obama presidency is that a White House obsessed with income inequality has managed to produce only more inequality. Arguably every policy that this administration has pursued — from the $830 billion stimulus bill, to giant welfare program expan sions, to massive infusions of cheap money into the economy via the Federal Reserve, to ObamaCare and then tax increases on those at the top of the income ladder — was designed as part of a great Robin Hood strategy to take from the rich and give to the poor. Instead, by the president's own admission, the bottom 90% have seen almost no progress.

So Obama's infatuation with steal from the rich and give to the poor has backfired. Just listen to a speech by the darlings of the left these days, Hillary Clinton and Elizabeth Warren, and all you will hear is how the middle class has gotten shafted while Obama has been president. News alert: That may be why Democrats got wiped out in the last election.
"
238,XL,"So why would anyone think that more of the same is going to lead to a different result?
"
239,XL,"Mr. Obama likes to say that the middle class has been in a rut for decades. Nonsense. In the 1980s and 1990s, the middle class made startling financial progress. From 1983 to 2005, upward income mobility allowed the middle class to see a rise in real incomes of near 30%. That was an era of relatively low tax rates, free trade, a responsible Fed, welfare reform, and pro-business regulatory policies that allowed American companies to compete in world markets. Many people at the top became very wealthy, but the rising tide of that era lifted almost all boats.
"
240,XL,"What does Mr. Obama propose to help the middle class? Start with a series of boneheaded new taxes on the rich that sound like they were designed by French economist Thomas Piketty, the new guru on economics in liberal America. They could very easily stall the economy yet again:

Raising the tax will mean less money flows to get new American companies running, at a time when studies are showing that entrepreneurial ventures are already getting started at a slower pace under Obama. Fewer new businesses means fewer jobs.
"
242,XL,"Raise the estate and inheritance tax to 60%. Two years ago, Congress and the president reached a rare bipartisan deal to cap the death tax at 40%. Now Obama wants to raise it even further. But when you tax lifetime savings, the rich — who already have paid taxes on their income when they earned it — simply invest less in family businesses and find tax shelters to avoid paying the tax. Family-owned businesses are the lifeblood of the American economy, and if we want more jobs we need more investment in them, not less.

243,XL,"A new tax on banks. This seems like a small tax of 0.07% on liabilities at about 100 large financial firms with more than $50 billion in assets.

How will making trades and deals that get made in firms based in Manhattan or Los Angeles or Chicago more expensive relative to those in Tokyo, Beijing, London, or Hong Kong help American workers?
"
244,XL,"What would this money be used for? Free stuff. Free community college. More dollars for student loans. Mandatory paid family leave. ""Gender equity"" in the workforce. Minimum-wage hikes. More infrastructure spending — just not for the Keystone XL pipeline. Tax credits for those at the bottom of the income scale, even though the vast majority of those in the bottom 40% already pay no income tax.
"
245,XL,"These tax-and-spend policies are hardly innovative or original. In fact, Europe has tested them for decades. In euroland, high investment and income taxes — along the lines of Obama and Piketty — pay for a vast social welfare state to help the poor.

271,XL,"Rep. Steve Russell gives the Republican Party's Weekly RemarksGood morning. I’m Steve Russell, a new member of the House of Representatives from Oklahoma’s Fifth District.Our new Congress has a great opportunity to restore Constitutional government and place the American people and their priorities first. As lawmakers, we must never forget that our government was designed to derive its power from the consent of the people. (Scroll down for video of these remarks.)Sadly, we’ve seen Washington ignore your concerns about the economy, spending, jobs and making our nation secure.Republicans and Democrats both care, but we hold different views about the ability of the people to make a bright future or whether the government should stand in your way and define that future for you.As Americans, we have not lost our capacity for greatness. We can still overcome the odds.Take the President’s regulations and obstruction of our energy sector: we have seen hard-working Americans innovate and transform our economy only to have the president try and take credit for it.We have seen Americans families work together in their communities to make ends meet paycheck to paycheck even while our volunteer armed forces sacrifice to keep us safe in a dangerous and shifting world.Despite it all, deep in our hearts, Americans still want America to be great. We still are.I, like you, refuse to give up on this great country. I'm joined by a wave of colleagues that you sent to Congress who believe the same thing.We have the resources to transform our economy, the talents to work together to solve our problems, and the grit to lead in a dangerous world that looks to us for hope and stability—an American beacon that still shines when others only provide a dim view of the future.With your inspiration, this new Congress is hard at work. Here are four things the House has already voted to do:Lift the burden on small businesses so they can hire more of our veterans without penalties;Repeal ObamaCare’s absurd 30-hour work-week definition so we can get people working again full-time;Build the Keystone XL pipeline, with its more than 42,000 American jobs and safe energy for our children's future, friends and allies;Force bureaucratic agencies to regulate with more honesty, thrift and transparency.These measures are only the beginning.Now President Obama doesn’t agree with our direction, the one that you, the voters, asked us to take, and he has threatened to block your progress. But we challenge him to listen to the people instead of standing in the way of your future.As we take these steps, we must do it with the guidance and principles that founded our nation. You don’t build a building without a blueprint. You don’t chart your future by taking shortcuts but rather do it with fairness and unity.That's why the House voted to....
"
272,XL,"....stop the president’s unilateral action on immigration. It's not about opportunity, it is about the Constitution and being fair to those legal immigrants who follow the law.On at least 22 separate occasions, the president said he did not have the authority to do what he did, and we are holding him to his word.Every time the president makes the playing field uneven and unfair, he tramples on the opportunity for all Americans.We can and will find solutions to immigration and will be happy to do it. But they will be your solutions through the Congress, not unfair executive actions.As we look to the future, let us do it together. We have heard your voice, and now we need your support. Together, we can get it done. Thanks for listening. Say a prayer for those protecting us and may God bless this great Republic. ####Previous weekly remarks from both parties are available here.RELATED:What you should know as the 2016 field formsWhat's Obama's problem calling radical Islam radical Islam?

277,XL,"Energy Policy: In spite of dramatically lower methane emissions from fracking, according to the EPA's own data, the agency wants to impose draconian regulations on the oil and gas industry similar to those on coal.The new rules that the White House announced on Wednesday aim to cut oil emissions of methane, a target of environmental groups, by 45% below 2012 levels, despite the fact that the emissions already show a sharp decline even as shale oil and gas production has skyrocketed.This war-on-shale action mirrors the administration's war on coal, with EPA rules impossible to meet economically and sometimes requiring technology that doesn't even exist.Never mind that there's no evidence of the climate change that environmentalists fear. And the EPA doesn't seem to care that the U.S. leads in reducing the fake nightmare of greenhouse gases.It is an alleged threat of methane to the Earth's climate that has green groups pushing the EPA to limit hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, a technology that has spawned a job-creating oil and natural-gas boom.It has also been used as a weapon against the Keystone XL pipeline, which would ship oil from Canada's oil sands and North Dakota's Bakken shale formation to our Gulf Coast refineries.""Reported methane emissions from (the) petroleum and natural gas systems sector have decreased by 12% since 2011, with the largest reductions coming from hydraulically fractured natural gas wells, which have decreased by 73% during that period,"" according to the EPA itself.The EPA would like to take credit for that reduction even as the technology improves on its own.But are we ready to bankrupt an energy industry for a marginal reduction in emissions whose effect on climate can't be measured, if it exists at all?We are doing this based not on science but on ideology, because this is what the administration's leftist environmental base wants.Environmental groups insist that methane is much more potent a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide and, if unregulated, would wipe out all the emission reductions achieved through the increased use of natural gas through fracking.As noted by Energy in Depth, a petroleum-industry research, education and outreach campaign, CO2 emissions are at their lowest in 20 years due to greater use of natural gas from fracking — part of an energy boom creating thousands of jobs and enhancing energy security.But ""ton for ton, methane causes at least 80 times more warming than carbon dioxide over a 20-year period,"" reads a letter signed by 15 Democratic senators, led by Rhode Island's Sheldon Whitehouse, to Obama, not bothering to explain how global temperatures have essentially flat-lined over the past 20 years.""This is the biggest opportunity to curb climate-change pollution that they (Obama and the EPA) haven't already seized,"" says David Doniger, director of the climate and clean air program at the National Resources Defense Council, an Obama ally in the war on fossil fuels. An environmental crisis, even if made up, is a terrible thing to waste.Methane emissions from oil and gas production, particularly fracking, are already declining. Also, as Howard Feldman, regulatory director at the American Petroleum Institute, points out, methane itself is a natural gas, and the industry already has a financial incentive to capture and sell it. Perhaps that explains the drop in emissions.""We don't need regulation to capture it, because we are incentivized to do it,"" Feldman says. ""We want to bring it to market.""Unfortunately, neither the EPA nor the White House wants to be confused with facts or with the truth that the free market, like earth's climate, can be self-regulating to our benefit.

280,XL,"Shares of TransCanada (TRP), developer of the Keystone XL pipeline, quickly jumped, then eased to a 1.3% afternoon gain in the stock market today after a Nebraska Supreme Court ruling helped clear the way for the pipeline's planned route through the state.The decision comes a day after the newly Republican-controlled Senate Energy Committee approved a bill that would allow the pipeline to be built. The bill now goes before the full Senate for debate, with a final vote expected before month's end. The House on Friday approved a measure allowing the pipeline's construction. But a veto threat from President Obama looms.Republicans, who now control Congress, said that they would make the pipeline a top priority, arguing that the project would create jobs and boost U.S. energy independence. Critics of the pipeline argue that the project's prospects for job creation are vastly overrated, and they have raised concerns about potential environmental impact.The pipeline would ship crude oil from Canada to refineries near the Gulf Coast.On Friday, four of the seven Nebraska Supreme Court judges voted to block a 2012 law that allows the state's governor to determine the pipeline's route, agreeing with a lower court's ruling on a lawsuit from property owners challenging the measure. But five votes were needed to deem the law unconstitutional. The lack of enough votes dismissed the lawsuit and allowed the law to stand.The court's ruling essentially leaves the proposed pipeline to the State Department for a final decision on the matter because it crosses the Candadian border. The Obama administration had delayed the decision pending the lawsuit's outcome.President Obama has also expressed concern about whether the pipeline could negatively impact the environment, despite numerous studies showing otherwise. Most experts consider the pipeline safer and less polluting than moving the oil by truck or rail.TransCanada's stock has struggled with its 50-day line since September and was still below the line on Friday. Its Friday gain put shares at 46.99 while the 50-day line hovered at 48.31.Canadian oil stocks, like Suncor Energy (SU), Talisman Energy (TLM) and Canadian Natural Resources (CNQ), were little changed on the news. The oil sector overall has struggled due to sinking oil prices.

311,XL,"His long Hawaii vacation over and new Republican majorities ensconced in firm control of Congress, President Obama today set out to make the last quarter of his administration more productive and radically different from his first six years racked by partisanship and finger-pointing.Obama wasted no time setting a New Year's tone of conciliation and cooperation with the empowered GOP through a series of urgent meetings with congressional leaders to find common ground on work for the American people. As he put it in his Dec. 19 news conference:""I’m being absolutely sincere when I say I want to work with this new Congress to get things done, to make those investments, to make sure the government is working better and smarter.""Oh, wait. No. Obama's done none of that. That's what a smart
"

313,XL,"1994. And clearly has no intention of
"
314,XL,"fulfilling his ""absolutely sincere"" pledge to work with the equal branch
"
315,XL,"of government on Capitol Hill.In fact, on the very day the 114th Congress convened, the new, more cooperative Obama kicked off the session by vowing to veto a bipartisan congressional endorsement of the job-rich Keystone XL pipeline that he's been pretending to evaluate for six years now. That could prove embarrassing, however, if Keystone gets a veto-proof two-thirds vote.Then to underline his disinterest in developing a viable working relationship, the Democrat is fleeing Washington today and tomorrow and the next day for his umpteenth campaign swing telling voters what they need to tell Congress to do.The White House bills the trip to Detroit, Phoenix and Knoxville as a preview of his State of the Union address on Jan. 20. He will talk about the auto industry recovery that cost nearly 10-billion taxpayer dollars and the booming economy, housing and affording college.Most presidents travel to repeat their SOTU wish-list themes after they're presented to a joint session of Congress on prime-time TV. But aides say this year Obama intends to spend the next two weeks talking about what he's going to talk about. On Jan. 20, he'll actually talk the talk. And then after, he'll talk about what he talked about.Conan O'Brien pointedly described the president's pointless advance speech journey earlier this week: ""Obama plans a three-day tour to preview his State of the Union address. It's pretty exciting—Obama rushes out on the stage and shouts, “ARE YOU READY FOR SOME STUFF THAT’S NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN?”These last 24 months of a presidency (or 743 days) are difficult for any chief executive, especially one who cherishes the controlled speaking spotlight as much as Obama.He has no control in Congress anymore, no Harry Reid to prevent bills from reaching the Oval Office so that Obama can blame the Republican House for obstruction.He's hashed and re-hashed and re-re-hashed the same subjects for a very long time. And it shows.When Obama sought to help Democrat candidates with joint campaign appearances before Nov. 4, audience members could be seen departing as he began to speak, as if they'd seen that movie before.This White House could be buoyed by a few recent polls showing a minor tick up in Obama's job approval. It may not be coincidence that the improvement coincides with Obama's vacation and 18-day absence from the news cycle.The Gallup Poll has noted that Obama's job approval in 2014 was remarkably steady compared to previous years. He began full of hope and change at 67% in 2009, quickly faded to 51% in 2010-11 as the stimulus failed, bounced up to 57% for the reelection, then down to 54% as his high in 2013.Last year as impatience mounted with the tepid economic recovery, the VA hospital scandals and the unfolding ObamaCare disaster, the Democrat's highest approval cratered to 45% and his lowest was 40%. That's better than George W. Bush's 37% during his Iraq war-weary sixth year.But Obama's approval is well under the sixth-year approval of every other two-term president since World War II, especially Bill Clinton's 67%.Gallup notes Obama's smaller five-point range last year, saying that indicates his approval/disapproval is pretty well set in the minds of Americans and has become largely immune to positive news like improving economic indicators Obama will tout on his trip.Of course, Obama could break pattern and act like a leader, engaging with Speaker John Boehner and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and calling their bluff on GOP promises of cooperation and joint efforts. Maybe actually agree on a few things. That would take some humility and more effort than flying around in a luxury 747 and talking at select adoring audiences.Obama's not the first president in his last two years to confront a Congress controlled by the opposition. As one of them promised, ""We're going to disagree on some things, but there are going to be areas of agreement and we've got to be able to make that happen.""That POTUS, by the way, was Barack Obama last month.RELATED:The GOP's plan to boost hiring of veteransObama promised unity, delivered spectacular divisionsLoser Louie Gohmert's got a problem winning with Boehner
"
316,XL,"GOP Senate Candidate Bill Cassidy delivers the Republican Party Weekly MessageHello. I’m Doctor Bill Cassidy. I’ve had the privilege of representing the 6th Congressional District of Louisiana.As a doctor, I’ve worked in Louisiana’s public hospital system treating the uninsured and under-insured for 25 years.When my patients tell me about their health concerns, they also tell me they are worried about the economy, their jobs, the direction of our country. Many families, many Louisiana families, are struggling. They need better jobs, better wages, better benefits.We have the opportunity to create these jobs. It starts with developing North America's natural resources and securing America’s energy independence now.That’s why I’ve been fighting for job-creating projects like the Keystone XL pipeline.Last week, the House of Representatives passed the Cassidy Keystone bill which would approve the construction of this pipeline. This is the ninth time the House has voted to build the Keystone pipeline.Building Keystone would create more than 40,000 high-paying jobs, putting billions of dollars in workers’ pockets, and give a much needed boost to America’s construction industry.Manufacturers and their employees throughout the economy also benefit from the construction of this infrastructure project.Refiners in Louisiana and along the Gulf Coast benefit from a reliable supply of heavy crude, including American oil from North Dakota, which would be transported through the pipeline.More than 60 percent of Americans support building the pipeline.The State Department review found that the pipeline would have little or no impact on the environment. And it will also save lives, because when oil is transported by train or truck, inevitably there are accidents and workers may die.Yet President Obama doesn’t seem to care.The case for approving the pipeline is clear and obvious. This is a perfect example of what the American people want President Obama and Congress to do. Americans’ frustration with the President’s failure to strengthen the economy, create jobs and make America energy secure was evident in the election November 4th.But more than six years after the Keystone application was first submitted, the pipeline has still not been approved. This is six years too long. So why hasn’t President Obama approved?Why did it take Louisiana’s Senior Senator nearly 3,000 days to do something about it?If there was ever legislation that should be easy to get through the United States Senate, it is the Keystone XL pipeline.When the House passed the Cassidy Keystone bill, we made it as easy as possible for the Senate to get a bill to the President’s desk. The Cassidy bill contained the legislative language proposed by the Senate.I worked with colleagues in the House of Representatives to pass this version as quickly as possible. It passed with strong Republican and Democrat support.Unfortunately, President Obama and his supporters in the Senate oppose the Keystone jobs.It is time for the President to approve these jobs.But this isn’t just about Keystone. Keystone has become a symbol for the need to achieve North American energy independence.We need to expand access for energy production both on and offshore, and to allow the development of the infrastructure to transport fuel to the American people.That’s why Americans spoke loud and clear on November 4th. They want Congress to work together to do what’s right for the American people. They rejected President Obama’s agenda that discourages the creation of manufacturing and construction jobs — the jobs that would be created because of projects like Keystone.Americans voted for Republicans. Republicans — we are the party of jobs. And on December 6th, it’s the people of Louisiana’s turn to be heard.We, the people of Louisiana will decide whether we want someone in the Senate who represents President Obama, or who represents us. Someone who will work hard for jobs in Louisiana all the time, not just when their job is on the line.Someone who will repeal and replace ObamaCare with patient-centered solutions; Who will push back on the EPA’s job-killing regulations; Who will fight against President Obama’s executive amnesty;Who will defend our second amendment rights; And who will push to get the Keystone pipeline and other energy development projects built.I’m running for the United States Senate because I am that person. Louisiana needs a Senator who can pass Keystone. Louisiana does not need a Senator who supports President Obama 97 percent of the time; we need a Senator who supports us, the people of Louisiana, 100 percent of the time.Representing the people of Louisiana is a great honor. On December 6th, Louisiana will choose our next U.S. Senator. My commitment to you is that if you choose me, Bill Cassidy, I will do my best to live up to that honor. Thank you. God bless America, and God bless the great state of Louisiana. ####Previous weekly remarks from both parties are available here.RELATED: Is it Clinton or Warren in Democrats' future?Can you skip your ObamaCare premiums next month?White House fence-jumping incidents traced to Joe Biden

317,XL,"Extremism: The Keystone pipeline's failure in the Senate doesn't just doom Sen. Mary Landrieu in next month's runoff. It proves the Democrats who smear Republicans as extremists are the real radicals.There's little of greater value politically than a U.S. Senate seat; for a party shifting into the minority it could mean the difference between success and failure in a filibuster, or in preventing override of their president's veto.But given the chance to help Landrieu, their somewhat moderate comrade, keep her seat representing Louisiana, Senate Democrats gave her the cold shoulder, choosing instead environmentalist ideology — and cold cash.Landrieu, facing a Dec. 6 runoff election against Republican Rep. Bill Cassidy, sought to convince Louisianans of her clout with Democratic leader Harry Reid by lobbying her fellow Democrats and engineering passage of the Keystone XL pipeline, supported by about 65% of Americans. But by a razor-thin 59-41 she failed to get the required 60 votes.That means the new Republican-controlled Senate can start things off next year with a real chance for a veto-proof 67 votes in favor of extending the pipeline from western Canada to the U.S. Gulf Coast. Along with the new oil would come 42,000 jobs, enhanced energy security and lower fuel prices.If Republicans are the extremists Democrats and their friends in the establishment media make them out to be, how come they have any chance at all of getting a bipartisan veto-proof majority on Keystone next year?  How come President Obama refuses to commit himself with an explicit veto warning?An override of an Obama veto next year would be an earthquake in Washington, confirming him as a lame duck. Which is why the president is keeping his options open and may well sign it into law, accompanied by the usual claims about backing it all along.There's another reason so many of Landrieu's fellow Democratic senators would rather wave goodbye to her than vote for Keystone. Billionaire environmentalist Tom Steyer with his NextGen Climate activist organization spent more than $57 million financing the campaigns of many of them this last election cycle.He has become the Democrats' biggest money man, but his donations are only part of about $85 million that green interests spent to help the party in this year's midterms.And don't forget Warren Buffett, who gave a cool billion to Barack ""I don't take money from super-PACs"" Obama's Priorities USA Action super-PAC in 2012.  Keystone would be a direct competitor to Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway railway.When it comes to extremism and corruption, Democrats win hands down — even if it means not helping one of their own to win.

Ackman's Pershing Square fund built up a stake as it had pushed for Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) to acquire Allergan. And Citigroup Tuesday raised its price target on Actavis to $310 from $250, citing potential synergies and growth prospects for Actavis.Investors seemed pleased that Valeant will not have to go through the merger process with Allergan, and took its stock up more than 4% in more than double usual volume, after rising nearly 2% on Monday. Valeant, under a deal with Ackman, will get 15% of the profit from Pershing Square's Allergan holding.Allergan rose 2.1% to 213.50 as Actavis' higher stock price means a higher deal valuation.Valeant, which is also on the IBD 50 list of top-rated stocks, can now focus on its broad line of drugs, mainly in dermatology, neurology, eye health and branded generics. Its portfolio includes antidepressant Wellbutrin XL and Liposoniz, Thermage and Fraxel in the professional skin-care sector.Gilead Sciences (GILD) climbed 3% in higher volume after the European Union granted the company permission to market Harvoni, the first once-daily single tablet regimen to treat hepatitis C, a highly infectious disease that primarily affects the liver and can lead to cirrhosis, a potentially fatal disease. It combines the blockbuster Sovaldi with another drug.Israel-based Taro Pharmaceutical (TARO) continued to recover from an 11% drop in three days after the company on Nov. 9 reported strong earnings and revenue gains for the Sept. 30-ended quarter, partly on price increases, but said it also had a marginal decline in volume.Its stock was on track Tuesday afternoon to post its third straight daily rise, and was trading up 1% in more than twice normal volume.Follow James DeTar on Twitter: @IBD_JDeTar.

"
322,XL,"start on the people’s business. (Scroll down for video of these remarks.)If we work together, we have a great opportunity to grow our economy and put our nation on solid footing for a bright future. That’s why the House will start off with jobs bills that have bipartisan support but were never considered by a Democratic-run Senate.One of those initiatives is a bill I’ve sponsored called the Hire More Heroes Act. What this bill does: it makes a commonsense change to the president’s health care law that will encourage small businesses to hire more of our nation’s veterans.You see, one problem with the health care law — one of many — is that because of its costs and mandates, small businesses face higher costs and have to hold off on hiring. When small businesses — the engine of our economy — can’t hire, we can’t move forward.That’s where the Hire More Heroes Act comes in. This bill exempts veterans already enrolled in healthcare plans through the Department of Defense or the VA from being counted toward the employee limit under the health care law.So not only are we providing small businesses — and our economy — with much-needed relief, but we’re also helping more of our veterans find work. Because despite receiving the best training in the world, post-9/11 veterans are consistently faced with higher unemployment rates than that of other veterans. As more and more of these men and women return home, the Hire More Heroes Act will give them a better chance in a still-tough job market.The Hire More Heroes Act is an example of the kind of bipartisan jobs bills the House will be bringing up on your behalf. In the coming days, the House will also act on legislation to approve the Keystone XL pipeline, and to restore the 40-hour workweek for middle class families.From there, more good ideas for jobs and growth will follow. If the president is willing to work with us, we’ll have a real chance to address our nation's most pressing challenges.There’s one more thing I want to tell you about the Hire More Heroes Act. This idea didn’t come from Washington; it came from right here in Illinois. Brad Lavite, the superintendent of the Veterans Assistance Commission in Madison County came to me after seeing how unemployed veterans and service members were having a difficult time navigating the new health care law. Then we got started on this and other ideas to helpListening to the people and making your priorities our priorities: that’s what you can expect from this new American Congress. If we all unite and work together, 2015 will be a great year for our country.For now, thank you for listening. God bless all our veterans and service members, and God bless the United States of America. ####Previous weekly remarks from both parties are available here.RELATED:From Hawaii, the Obamas praise holidays in the White HouseAs Obama golfs, Joe Biden speaks eloquently at slain cop's serviceObama hurries Cuba relations thaw before Sony makes a Castro movie

323,XL,"Politics: When they had the majority, Senate Democrats quarterbacked President Obama's delay-of-game strategy on the Keystone XL pipeline and its tens of thousands of jobs. Now they hold a vote just to save one senator's job.When Democrat Sen. Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, locked in a runoff battle with Louisiana Rep. Bill Cassidy, announced Wednesday that she had secured an agreement from her party leaders to hold a floor vote on the Keystone XL pipeline after years of delay, we had to add ours to the voices asking, why now?For Landrieu, a vote on Keystone may seem to be just the life preserver she needs as she struggles to survive the GOP wave of 2014. For the Democratic Party, it may seem an opportunity to salvage at least one of their brethren and why not vote now, when an outgoing Democratic senate and not an incoming Republican one could take the credit.We welcome a vote and approval in the Senate as well as the House vote and approval on legislation approving KXL sponsored by Landrieu's opponent, Cassidy. The pipeline would create tens of thousands of new jobs in its construction, operation, and in spin-off effects as it brings nearly a million barrels of oil a day from not only Canada's tar sands but also the exploding oil fields of North Dakota's Bakken shale formation.To be fair, Landrieu and GOP Sen. John Hoeven of North Dakota introduced the Senate bill on May 1. A May 2013 vote on a nonbinding amendment to a Senate budget draft won the votes of 17 Democrats, including Landrieu, to go along with all 45 Republicans. Buy no real vote was scheduled until the Democrats lost the Senate and Landrieu teetered on the edge of political oblivion.The Democrats cynical scheduling of a Keystone vote can only feed the cynicism most voters feel toward politicians and the political process.Democrat Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, a state suffering from the administration's war on fossil fuels in general and coal in particular — and which just elected Republican Shelley Moore Capito to a formerly Democratic seat — expressed bewilderment at the news conference with Landrieu that a vote has taken so long.""I can't for the life of me understand why we haven't to date been able to move this piece of legislation forward,"" said Manchin.Well, Senator, maybe because your Majority Leader Harry Reid, Obama and the likes of wealthy donor Tom Steyer didn't want it to happen. Now all concerned want to salvage a Senate seat and deny Republicans credit for what would happen in January anyway.""It has been 600 days since 62 senators signed their support for constructing the Keystone XL pipeline and only now is Sen. Landrieu putting her foot down,"" says a skeptical Dan Holler, communications director for Heritage Action for America, the advocacy arm of the Heritage Foundation.""Demanding a vote now, in the middle of a runoff, is pretty blatant and everybody gets the joke.""Keystone XL merits our approval, but Landrieu and her scheming party do not.

324,XL,"Rep. Brad Wenstrup gives the Republican Party's Weekly RemarksGood morning, I’m Dr. Brad Wenstrup, and I have the honor of representing Ohio’s Second Congressional District.In the days since the election, Republicans have begun to make good on our vow to honor your trust by focusing first on jobs and the economy. (Scroll down for video of these remarks.)On Friday, the House voted to approve the Keystone XL pipeline, which will help lower energy costs and get people back to work. We ask President Obama and Senate Democrats to finally give this project the green light that the American people have been waiting for.We’ll also work to pass the Hire More Heroes Act, which will encourage businesses large and small to hire America’s veterans - the very Americans to which we owe our security and freedom.We’ll take on ObamaCare... and we’ll propose that Congress — not the bureaucrats — has the final say on all new major regulations.This is just a start on getting some important things done in the months ahead.Now, after the election, the president may have said “I hear you,” but by the looks of things, it’s just the opposite.On Monday, he proposed a new set of rules to regulate — of all things — the Internet, one of the few places innovation has thrived, even in a struggling economy.Then he agreed with the Chinese government on rules that continue his misguided crusade against affordable, reliable energy. In this economy, we need relief from the EPA’s grip, not more heavy-handed mandates that take away American jobs and squeeze middle-class families.The president also continues to raise the possibility of taking unilateral action on executive amnesty. We've warned him that such action would make it that much harder to pass immigration reform and find common ground.Sadly, there’s even more.We’ve now come to learn that one of ObamaCare’s architects said the law passed because Americans were “too stupid to know” what was happening.This is the same arrogance we’ve seen time and time again from this administration and its allies. This is insulting to all of us.They say one thing and do another. They spend money we don’t have - with little to show for it but more debt and broken promises. And they stay off course - even when hardworking people are stuck earning less and paying more for just about everything.Americans deserve far better.You deserve a government that doesn’t just “hear you,” but actually listens to you and puts your priorities first — that focuses on securing more jobs and a better future for our children.That’s what you can expect from the new Republican majority. Thank you for listening, and God bless the United States of America. ####Previous Weekly Remarks by both parties are available by clicking here.

""Never let up"" is one of Saul Alinsky's ""Rules For Radicals.""'Will Obama fade or fight?"" asks the headline of a Los Angeles Times story reporting the details of how ""an unbowed President Barack Obama"" will, to quote the president, ""squeeze every last little bit of opportunity"" to enact the rest of his agenda over his final two years in office.""Down But Not Out,"" Obama ""Presses Ahead,"" says a New York Times headline to a similar story.What a difference from even the Times' token ""conservative"" columnist David Brooks, who once upon a time declared of Democrats' success in the 2006 midterm elections: ""The American public delivered a stunning electoral judgment against the Iraq War, the Republican Party and President Bush.""We didn't hear then from the establishment media about a ""down but not out"" George W. Bush pressing ahead. We did hear right after the new Congress convened in 2007, however, from none other than one Sen. Barack Obama that ""removing of all U.S. combat forces from Iraq by March 31st, 2008"" was ""what the American people demanded in the November election.""In the 2014 November election, there was ""a stunning electoral judgment"" against President Obama and his policies — which the president himself during the campaign conceded were on the ballot — and ""what the American people demanded"" was that he be stopped.But instead, the president will go full frontal and defy the American people: Within days he is to issue an executive order that cannot be viewed as less than an impeachable offense, giving at least 6 million illegal immigrants amnesty — as criminal aliens taunt the law enforcement officials holding them in custody. The ""landmark"" greenhouse gas pact he brings home from Beijing asks the Chinese only to increase emissions more slowly by 2030, while the U.S. commits to further decrease our output. He plans through regulation what amounts to a government takeover of the Internet. Aides warn that he will veto the Keystone XL pipeline, which would bring crude oil to U.S. refineries. Perhaps biggest of all, he seems set this month to agree to a deal that would let Islamofascist Iran keep its nuclear program, endangering the free world in Neville Chamberlain-like fashion.No one should be surprised.Rule number 8 in Obama idol Saul Alinsky's book ""Rules For Radicals"" states: ""Keep the pressure on. Never let up.""Alinsky advises radicals to ""Attack, attack, attack from all sides, never giving the reeling organization a chance to rest, regroup, recover and re-strategize.""Barack Obama first came to note when in his keynote address to the 2004 Democratic convention he warned of ""those who are preparing to divide us ... who embrace the politics of anything goes.""A decade later, even with his agenda refuted by voters, this is a president for whom anything goes when it comes to what he wants the U.S. government doing. And he's not done yet.

339,XL,"After the border surge that saw thousands of young immigrants from Latin America cross into the U.S., setting off an often-bitter political debate, fully 59% say a new immigration law is unlikely in 2015.

344,XL,"Other IBD/TIPP findings include:

"
352,XL,"Good morning, I’m Mike Kelly, and I have the tremendous privilege of representing Pennsylvania’s Third Congressional District.
"
353,XL,"Today I’m offering President Obama a lump of coal for Christmas. Not because he’s been bad this year — though I’ll get to that. (Scroll down for video of these remarks.)
"
354,XL,"No, I’m offering the president a lump of coal because this product right here holds the potential for a 21st-century economic revival.
"
355,XL,"You see, coal is our most abundant and valuable resource. It lights our homes, keeps our electric bills low, and puts food on the table for countless families. More than 40,000 jobs in my state alone are tied to coal.
"
356,XL,"But this isn’t just about coal country — no, it’s about our whole country.
"
357,XL,"Because no other nation in the world has been blessed with such abundant, affordable, and accessible resources.
"
358,XL,"And with all that God has given us, we shouldn’t be just trying to keep up with the pack. My goodness, we should be leading the world.
"
359,XL,"Now if only we had a president willing to seize this opportunity. He tells us he’s for ‘all of the above’ but then he leaves out everything that’s below.
"
360,XL,"The president said he would bankrupt the coal industry and he’s spent his presidency trying to do just that. Federal regulations have already forced two coal-fired power plants in my district to close over the past two years. Hundreds more are set to shut down around the country.
"
361,XL,"He’s put up so many roadblocks to American energy that all our production is coming from state and private lands.
"
362,XL,"Now even when the president’s own party stopped him from imposing his cap-and-trade tax, he said it was ‘just one way of skinning the cat’ and then he directed the EPA to do his bidding for him.
"
363,XL,"Instead of forcing our workers to live with less, the president should let us use our God-given resources and talents to help Americans get back to work and make our nation the energy superpower it can be — and quite frankly, that it needs to be. 
"
364,XL,"So whether it’s stopping these regulations, expediting infrastructure, or expanding production, there’s so much we can do to encourage the development of all forms of American energy.
"
365,XL,"These aren’t just Republican solutions — these are common-sense American ideas that have support in both parties. You’re going to see them again in the new Congress, starting with a vote to approve the Keystone XL pipeline.
"
366,XL,"Because manufacturing things, making things — and doing it better than anyone else in the world — that’s what America’s always been about. That’s how we’ve built such a robust and dynamic economy. If we all pull together, we can make 2015 the year we restore our nation of builders.
"
367,XL,"But that’s next year. Right now, we are getting ready to celebrate Christmas. And as we do, I hope you’ll set aside a moment to remember all those who gave their lives this year for the cause of freedom, and pray for those spending this holiday season away from their families and loved ones.

"
391,XL,"** The country has 759 days left of Obama in the Oval Office. Forget Gallup.

"
403,XL,"Text of President Obama's Year-End News Conference Dec. 19, 2014
"
404,XL,"THE PRESIDENT: Hello, everybody. We've really got a full house today, huh? Well, all I want for Christmas is to take your questions. (Laughter.) But first let me say a little bit about this year.
"
405,XL,"In last year’s final press conference, I said that 2014 would be a year of action and would be a breakthrough year for America. And it has been. Yes, there were crises that we had to tackle around the world, many that were unanticipated. We have more work to do to make sure our economy, our justice system, and our government work not just for the few, but for the many. But there is no doubt that we can enter into the New Year with renewed confidence that America is making significant strides where it counts.
"
406,XL,"The steps that we took early on to rescue our economy and rebuild it on a new foundation helped make 2014 the strongest year for job growth since the 1990s.  All told, over a 57-month streak, our businesses have created nearly 11 million new jobs.  Almost all the job growth that we’ve seen have been in full-time positions.  Much of the recent pickup in job growth has been in higher-paying industries.  And in a hopeful sign for middle-class families, wages are on the rise again.
"
407,XL,"Our investments in American manufacturing have helped fuel its best stretch of job growth also since the 1990s.  America is now the number-one producer of oil, the number-one producer of natural gas.  We're saving drivers about 70 cents a gallon at the pump over last Christmas.  And effectively today, our rescue of the auto industry is officially over.  We've now repaid taxpayers every dime and more of what my administration committed, and the American auto industry is on track for its strongest year since 2005.  And we've created about half a million new jobs in the auto industry alone.
"
408,XL,"Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, about 10 million Americans have gained health insurance just this past year.  Enrollment is beginning to pick up again during the open enrollment period.  The uninsured rate is at a near record low.  Since the law passed, the price of health care has risen at its slowest rate in about 50 years.  And we’ve cut our deficits by about two-thirds since I took office, bringing them to below their 40-year average.
"
409,XL,"Meanwhile, around the world, America is leading.  We’re leading the coalition to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL -- a coalition that includes Arab partners.  We’re leading the international community to check Russian aggression in Ukraine. We are leading the global fight to combat Ebola in West Africa, and we are preventing an outbreak from taking place here at home. We’re leading efforts to address climate change, including last month’s joint announcement with China that’s already jump-starting new progress in other countries.  We’re writing a new chapter in our leadership here in the Americas by turning a new page on our relationship with the Cuban people.  And in less than two weeks, after more than 13 years, our combat mission in Afghanistan will be over.  Today, more of our troops are home for the holidays than any time in over a decade. Still, many of our men and women in uniform will spend Christmas in harm’s way.  And they should know that the country is united in support of you and grateful not only to you but also to your families.
"
410,XL,"The six years since the crisis have demanded hard work and sacrifice on everybody’s part.  But as a country, we have every right to be proud of what we’ve accomplished -- more jobs; more people insured; a growing economy; shrinking deficits; bustling industry; booming energy.  Pick any metric that you want -- America’s resurgence is real.  We are better off.
"
411,XL,"I’ve always said that recovering from the crisis of 2008 was our first order of business, and on that business, America has outperformed all of our other competitors.  Over the past four years, we’ve put more people back to work than all other advanced economies combined.  We’ve now come to a point where we have the chance to reverse an even deeper problem, the decades-long erosion of middle-class jobs and incomes, and to make sure that the middle class is the engine that powers our prosperity for decades to come.
"
412,XL,"To do that, we're going to have to make some smart choices; we've got to make the right choices.  We're going to have to invest in the things that secure even faster growth in higher-paying jobs for more Americans.  And I’m being absolutely sincere when I say I want to work with this new Congress to get things done, to make those investments, to make sure the government is working better and smarter.  We're going to disagree on some things, but there are going to be areas of agreement and we've got to be able to make that happen.  And that's going to involve compromise every once in a while, and we saw during this lame duck period that perhaps that spirit of compromise may be coming to the fore.
"
413,XL,"In terms of my own job, I'm energized, I'm excited about the prospects for the next couple of years, and I'm certainly not going to be stopping for a minute in the effort to make life better for ordinary Americans.  Because, thanks to their efforts, we really do have a new foundation that's been laid.  We are better positioned than we have been in a very long time.  A new future is ready to be written.  We've set the stage for this American moment.  And I'm going to spend every minute of my last two years making sure that we seize it.
"
414,XL,"My presidency is entering the fourth quarter; interesting stuff happens in the fourth quarter.  And I'm looking forward to it.  But going into the fourth quarter, you usually get a timeout.  I'm now looking forward to a quiet timeout -- Christmas with my family.  So I want to wish everybody a Merry Christmas, a Happy Hanukkah, a Happy New Year.  I hope that all of you get some time to spend with your families as well, because one thing that we share is that we're away too much from them.
"
415,XL,"And now, Josh has given me the “who’s been naughty and who’s been nice” list -- (laughter) -- and I'm going to use it to take some questions.  And we're going to start with Carrie Budoff Brown of Politico. There you go, Carrie.
"
416,XL,"Q: Thank you, Mr. President.  I’ll start on North Korea -- that seems to be the biggest topic today.  What does a proportional response look like to the Sony hack?  And did Sony make the right decision in pulling the movie?  Or does that set a dangerous precedent when faced with this kind of situation?
"
417,XL,"THE PRESIDENT:  Well, let me address the second question first.  Sony is a corporation.  It suffered significant damage.  There were threats against its employees.  I am sympathetic to the concerns that they faced.  Having said all that, yes, I think they made a mistake.
"
418,XL,"In this interconnected, digital world, there are going to be opportunities for hackers to engage in cyber assaults both in the private sector and the public sector.  Now, our first order of business is making sure that we do everything to harden sites and prevent those kinds of attacks from taking place.  When I came into office, I stood up a cyber-security interagency team to look at everything that we could at the government level to prevent these kinds of attacks.  We’ve been coordinating with the private sector, but a lot more needs to be done.  We’re not even close to where we need to be. 
"
419,XL,"And one of the things in the New Year that I hope Congress is prepared to work with us on is strong cyber-security laws that allow for information-sharing across private sector platforms, as well as the public sector, so that we are incorporating best practices and preventing these attacks from happening in the first place.
"
420,XL,"But even as we get better, the hackers are going to get better, too.  Some of them are going to be state actors; some of them are going to be non-state actors.  All of them are going to be sophisticated and many of them can do some damage.
"
421,XL,"We cannot have a society in which some dictator someplace can start imposing censorship here in the United States.  Because if somebody is able to intimidate folks out of releasing a satirical movie, imagine what they start doing when they see a documentary that they don’t like, or news reports that they don’t like. Or even worse, imagine if producers and distributors and others start engaging in self-censorship because they don’t want to offend the sensibilities of somebody whose sensibilities probably need to be offended.
"
422,XL,"So that’s not who we are.  That’s not what America is about.
"
423,XL,"Again, I’m sympathetic that Sony as a private company was worried about liabilities, and this and that and the other.  I wish they had spoken to me first.  I would have told them, do not get into a pattern in which you’re intimidated by these kinds of criminal attacks.  Imagine if, instead of it being a cyber-threat, somebody had broken into their offices and destroyed a bunch of computers and stolen disks.  Is that what it takes for suddenly you to pull the plug on something?
"
424,XL,"So we’ll engage with not just the film industry, but the news industry and the private sector around these issues.  We already have.  We will continue to do so.  But I think all of us have to anticipate occasionally there are going to be breaches like this.  They’re going to be costly.  They’re going to be serious.  We take them with the utmost seriousness.  But we can’t start changing our patterns of behavior any more than we stop going to a football game because there might be the possibility of a terrorist attack; any more than Boston didn’t run its marathon this year because of the possibility that somebody might try to cause harm.  So let’s not get into that way of doing business.
"
425,XL,"Q    Can you just say what the response would be to this attack?  Would you consider taking some sort of symbolic step like watching the movie yourself or doing some sort of screening here that -- 
"
426,XL,"THE PRESIDENT:  I’ve got a long list of movies I’m going to be watching.  (Laughter.)
"
427,XL,"Q Will this be one of them?
"
428,XL,"THE PRESIDENT:  I never release my full movie list. But let’s talk of the specifics of what we now know.  The FBI announced today and we can confirm that North Korea engaged in this attack.  I think it says something interesting about North Korea that they decided to have the state mount an all-out assault on a movie studio because of a satirical movie starring Seth Rogen and James Flacco [Franco].  (Laughter.)  I love Seth and I love James, but the notion that that was a threat to them I think gives you some sense of the kind of regime we’re talking about here.
"
429,XL,"They caused a lot of damage, and we will respond.  We will respond proportionally, and we’ll respond in a place and time and manner that we choose.  It’s not something that I will announce here today at a press conference.
"
430,XL,"More broadly, though, this points to the need for us to work with the international community to start setting up some very clear rules of the road in terms of how the Internet and cyber operates.  Right now, it’s sort of the Wild West.  And part of the problem is, is you’ve got weak states that can engage in these kinds of attacks, you’ve got non-state actors that can do enormous damage.  That’s part of what makes this issue of cyber-security so urgent.
"
431,XL,"Again, this is part of the reason why it’s going to be so important for Congress to work with us and get a actual bill passed that allows for the kind of information-sharing we need.  Because if we don’t put in place the kind of architecture that can prevent these attacks from taking place, this is not just going to be affecting movies, this is going to be affecting our entire economy in ways that are extraordinarily significant.
"
432,XL,"And, by the way, I hear you’re moving to Europe.  Where you going to be? Brussels.
"
433,XL,"Q    Yes.  Helping Politico start a new publication.  
"
434,XL,"THE PRESIDENT:  Well, congratulations.  
"
435,XL,"Q    I’ve been covering you since the beginning.
"
436,XL,"THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think --
"
437,XL,"Q    It’s been a long road for the both of us.
"
438,XL,"THE PRESIDENT:  I think there’s no doubt that what Belgium needs is a version of Politico.  (Laughter.)  
"
439,XL,"Q    I’ll take that as an endorsement.  
"
440,XL,"THE PRESIDENT:  The waffles are delicious there, by the way. Cheryl Bolen.  You’ve been naughty.  (Laughter.)  Cheryl, go ahead.
"
441,XL,"Q    Thank you, Mr. President.  Looking ahead to your work with Congress next year, you’ve mentioned as an area of possible compromise tax reform.  And so I am wondering, do you see a Republican Congress as presenting a better opportunity for actually getting tax reform next year?  Will you be putting out a new proposal?  Are you willing to consider both individual and corporate side of the tax ledger there?  And also, are you still concerned about corporate inversions?
"
442,XL,"THE PRESIDENT:  I think an all-Democratic Congress would have provided an even better opportunity for tax reform.  But I think, talking to Speaker Boehner and Leader McConnell that they are serious about wanting to get some things done.  The tax area is....
"
443,XL,"....one area where we can get things done.  And I think in the coming weeks leading up to the State of Union, there will be some conversations at the staff levels about what principles each side are looking at.
"
444,XL,"I can tell you broadly what I’d like to see.  I’d like to see more simplicity in the system.  I’d like to see more fairness in the system.  With respect to the corporate tax reform issue, we know that there are companies that are paying the full freight -- 35 percent -- higher than just about any other company on Earth, if you're paying 35 percent, and then there are other companies that are paying zero because they’ve got better accountants or lawyers.  That's not fair.  
"
445,XL,"There are companies that are parking money outside the country because of tax avoidance.  We think that it’s important that everybody pays something if, in fact, they are effectively headquartered in the United States.  In terms of corporate inversion, those are situations where companies really are headquartered here but, on paper, switch their headquarters to see if they can avoid paying their fair share of taxes.  I think that needs to be fixed.  
"
446,XL,"So, fairness, everybody paying their fair share, everybody taking responsibility I think is going to be very important.  
"
447,XL,"Some of those principles I’ve heard Republicans say they share.  How we do that -- the devil is in the details.  And I’ll be interested in seeing what they want to move forward.  I’m going to make sure that we put forward some pretty specific proposals building on what we’ve already put forward.
"
448,XL,"One other element of this that I think is important is -- and I’ve been on this hobby horse now for six years.  (Audience member sneezes.)  Bless you.  We’ve got a lot of infrastructure we’ve got to rebuild in this country if we're going to be competitive -- roads, bridges, ports, airports, electrical grids, water systems, sewage systems.  We are way behind.  
"
449,XL,"And early on we indicated that there is a way of us potentially doing corporate tax reform, lowering rates, eliminating loopholes so everybody is paying their fair share, and during that transition also providing a mechanism where we can get some infrastructure built.  I’d like to see us work on that issue as well.  Historically, obviously, infrastructure has not been a Democratic or a Republican issue, and I’d like to see if we can return to that tradition. Julie Pace.
"
450,XL,"Q    Thank you, Mr. President.  I wanted to ask about Cuba. What would you say to dissidents or democracy advocates inside Cuba who fear that the policy changes you announced this week could give the Castro regime economic benefits without having to address human rights or their political system?  When your administration was lifting sanctions on Myanmar you sought commitments of reform.  Why not do the same with Cuba?
"
451,XL,"And if I could just follow up on North Korea.  Do you have any indication that North Korea was acting in conjunction with another country, perhaps China?
"
452,XL,"THE PRESIDENT:  We’ve got no indication that North Korea was acting in conjunction with another country.
"
453,XL,"With respect to Cuba, we are glad that the Cuban government have released slightly over 50 dissidents; that they are going to be allowing the International Committee of the Red Cross and the United Nations human rights agencies to operate more freely inside of Cuba and monitor what is taking place.
"
454,XL,"I share the concerns of dissidents there and human rights activists that this is still a regime that represses its people. And as I said when I made the announcement, I don’t anticipate overnight changes, but what I know deep in my bones is that if you’ve done the same thing for 50 years and nothing has changed, you should try something different if you want a different outcome.
"
455,XL,"And this gives us an opportunity for a different outcome, because suddenly Cuba is open to the world in ways that it has not been before.  It’s open to Americans traveling there in ways that it hasn’t been before.  It’s open to church groups visiting their fellow believers inside of Cuba in ways they haven't been before.  It offers the prospect of telecommunications and the Internet being more widely available in Cuba in ways that it hasn’t been before.
"
456,XL,"And over time, that chips away at this hermetically sealed society, and I believe offers the best prospect then of leading to greater freedom, greater self-determination on the part of the Cuban people.  
"
457,XL,"I think it will happen in fits and starts.  But through engagement, we have a better chance of bringing about change then we would have otherwise.
"
458,XL,"Q    Do you have a goal for where you see Cuba being at the end of your presidency?
"
459,XL,"THE PRESIDENT:  I think it would be unrealistic for me to map out exactly where Cuba will be.  But change is going to come to Cuba.  It has to.  They’ve got an economy that doesn’t work.  They’ve been reliant for years first on subsidies from the Soviet Union, then on subsidies from Venezuela.  Those can’t be sustained.  And the more the Cuban people see what’s possible, the more interested they are going to be in change.  
"
460,XL,"But how societies change is country-specific, it’s culturally specific.  It could happen fast; it could happen slower than I’d like; but it’s going to happen.  And I think this change in policy is going to advance that. Lesley Clark.
"
461,XL,"Q    Thank you, Mr. President.  I had a number of questions on Cuba as well.  Appreciate that.  I wanted to --
"
462,XL,"THE PRESIDENT:  Do I have to write all these down?  How many are there?  (Laughter.)  “A number” sounded intimidating.
"
463,XL,"Q    As quick as I can.  As quick as I can.  I wanted to see if you got an assurances from the Cuban government that it would not revert to the same sort of -- sabotage the deal, as it has in the past when past Presidents had made similar overtures to the government.
"
464,XL,"THE PRESIDENT:  Meaning?  Be specific.  What do you mean?
"
465,XL,"Q    When the Clinton administration made some overtures, they shot down planes.  They sort of had this pattern of doing provocative -- provocative events.
"
466,XL,"THE PRESIDENT:  Okay, so just general provocative activity.
"
467,XL,"Q    Provocative activities any time the U.S. has sort of reached out a hand to them.  I wanted to see what is your knowledge of whether Fidel Castro -- did he have any role in the talks?  When you talked to President Raul Castro, did Fidel Castro’s name come up?  Or did you ask about him?  How he’s doing?  People haven't seen him in a while.  Given the deep opposition from some Republicans in Congress to lifting the embargo, to an embassy, to any of the changes that you’re doing, are you going to personally get involved in terms of talking to them about efforts that they want to do to block money on a new embassy?
"
468,XL,"THE PRESIDENT:  All right, Lesley, I think I’m going to cut you off here.  (Laughter.)  This is taking up a lot of time.
"
469,XL,"Q    Okay, all right.
"
470,XL,"THE PRESIDENT:  All right.  So, with respect to sabotage, I mean, my understanding of the history, for example, of the plane being shot down, it’s not clear that that was the Cuban government purposely trying to undermine overtures by the Clinton administration.  It was a tragic circumstance that ended up collapsing talks that had begun to take place.  I haven't seen a historical record that suggests that they shot the plane down specifically in order to undermine overtures by the Clinton government.
"
471,XL,"I think it is not precedented for the President of the United States and the President of Cuba to make an announcement at the same time that they are moving towards normalizing relations.  So there hasn’t been anything like this in the past. That doesn’t mean that over the next two years we can anticipate them taking certain actions that we may end up finding deeply troubling either inside of Cuba or with respect to their foreign policy.  And that could put significant strains on the relationship.  But that’s true of a lot of countries out there where we have an embassy.  And the whole point of normalizing relations is that it gives us a greater opportunity to have influence with that government than not.  
"
472,XL,"So I would be surprised if the Cuban government purposely tries to undermine what is now effectively its own policy.  I wouldn’t be surprised if they take at any given time actions that we think are a problem. And we will be in a position to respond to whatever actions they take the same way we do with a whole range of countries around the world when they do things we think are wrong.  But the point is, is that we will be in a better position I think to actually have some influence, and there may be carrots as well as sticks that we can then apply.
"
473,XL,"The only way that Fidel’s name came up -- I think I may have mentioned this in the Davie Muir article -- interview that I did -- was I delivered a fairly lengthy statement at the front end about how we’re looking forward to a new future in the relationship between our two countries, but that we are going to continue to press on issues of democracy and human rights, which we think are important.  
"
474,XL,"My opening remarks probably took about 15 minutes, which on the phone is a pretty long time.  And at the end of that, he said, Mr. President, you’re still a young man.  Perhaps you have the -- at the end of my remarks I apologized for taking such a long time, but I wanted to make sure that before we engaged in the conversation he was very clear about where I stood.  He said, oh, don’t worry about it, Mr. President, you’re still a young man and you have still the chance to break Fidel’s record -- he once spoke seven hours straight.  (Laughter.)
"
475,XL,"And then, President Castro proceeded to deliver his own preliminary remarks that last at least twice as long as mine.  (Laughter.)  And then I was able to say, obviously it runs in the family.  But that was the only discussion of Fidel Castro that we had. I sort of forgot all the other questions.  (Laughter.)  
"
476,XL,"Q    I have a few more if you’re -- how personally involved are you going to get in -- 
"
477,XL,"THE PRESIDENT:  With respect to Congress?  We cannot unilaterally bring down the embargo.  That’s codified in the Libertad Act.  And what I do think is going to happen, though, is there’s going to be a process where Congress digests it.  There are bipartisan supporters of our new approach, there are bipartisan detractors of this new approach.  People will see how the actions we take unfold.  And I think there’s going to be a healthy debate inside of Congress.  
"
478,XL,"And I will certainly weigh in.  I think that ultimately we need to go ahead and pull down the embargo, which I think has been self-defeating in advancing the aims that we’re interested in.  But I don’t anticipate that that happens right away.  I think people are going to want to see how does this move forward before there’s any serious debate about whether or not we would make major shifts in the embargo. Roberta Rampton.
"
479,XL,"Q    I want to follow on that by asking, under what conditions would you meet with President Castro in Havana? Would you have certain preconditions that you would want to see met before doing that?  And on the hack, I know that you said that you’re not going to announce your response, but can you say whether you’re considering additional economic or financial sanctions on North Korea?  Can you rule out the use of military force or some kind of cyber hit of your own?
"
480,XL,"THE PRESIDENT:  I think I’m going to leave it where I left it, which is we just confirmed that it was North Korea; we have been working up a range of options.  They will be presented to me.  I will make a decision on those based on what I believe is proportional and appropriate to the nature of this crime.With respect to Cuba, we’re not at a stage here where me visiting Cuba or President Castro coming to the United States is in the cards.  I don’t know how this relationship will develop over the next several years.  I’m a fairly young man so I imagine that at some point in my life I will have the opportunity to visit Cuba and enjoy interacting with the Cuban people.  But there’s nothing specific where we're trying to target some sort of visit on my part. Colleen McCain Nelson.
"
481,XL,"Q    Thank you, Mr. President. 
"
482,XL,"THE PRESIDENT:  There you are. 
"
483,XL,"Q    You spoke earlier about 2014 being a breakthrough year, and you ended the year with executive actions on Cuba and immigration and climate change.  But you didn't make much progress this year on your legislative agenda.  And some Republican lawmakers have said they're less inclined to work with you if you pursue executive actions so aggressively.  Are you going to continue to pursue executive actions if that creates more roadblocks for your legislative agenda?  Or have you concluded that it’s not possible to break the fever in Washington and the partisan gridlock here?
"
484,XL,"THE PRESIDENT:  I think there are real opportunities to get things done in Congress.  As I said before, I take Speaker Boehner and Mitch McConnell at their words that they want to get things done.  I think the American people would like to see us get some things done.  The question is going to be are we able to separate out those areas where we disagree and those areas where we agree.  I think there are going to be some tough fights on areas where we disagree.  
"
485,XL,"If Republicans seek to take health care away from people who just got it, they will meet stiff resistance from me.  If they try to water down consumer protections that we put in place in the aftermath of the financial crisis, I will say no.  And I’m confident that I’ll be able to uphold vetoes of those types of provisions.  But on increasing American exports, on simplifying our tax system, on rebuilding our infrastructure, my hope is that we can get some things done.  I’ve never been persuaded by this argument that if it weren’t for the executive actions they would have been more productive.  There’s no evidence of that.  So I intend to continue to do what I’ve been doing, which is where I see a big problem and the opportunity to help the American people, and it is within my lawful authority to provide that help, I’m going to do it.  And I will then, side-by-side, reach out to members of Congress, reach out to Republicans, and say, let’s work together; I’d rather do it with you.
"
486,XL,"Immigration is the classic example.  I was really happy when the Senate passed a bipartisan, comprehensive immigration bill.  And I did everything I could for a year and a half to provide Republicans the space to act, and showed not only great patience, but flexibility, saying to them, look, if there are specific changes you’d like to see, we're willing to compromise, we're willing to be patient, we're willing to work with you.  Ultimately it wasn’t forthcoming.
"
487,XL,"And so the question is going to be I think if executive actions on areas like minimum wage, or equal pay, or having a more sensible immigration system are important to Republicans, if they care about those issues, and the executive actions are bothering them, there is a very simple solution, and that is:  Pass bills.  And work with me to make sure I’m willing to sign those bills.  
"
488,XL,"Because both sides are going to have to compromise.  On most issues, in order for their initiatives to become law, I’m going to have sign off.  And that means they have to take into account the issues that I care about, just as I’m going to have to take into account the issues that they care about. All right.  I think this is going to be our last question.  Juliet Eilperin.  There you go. 
"
489,XL,"Q    Thanks so much.  So one of the first bills that Mitch McConnell said he will send to you is one that would authorize the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline.  When you talked about this in the past, you’ve minimized the benefits and you highlighted some of the risks associated with that project.  I’m wondering if you could tell us both what you would do when faced with that bill, given the Republican majority that we’ll have in both chambers.  And also, what do you see as the benefits?  And given the precipitous drop we’ve seen in oil prices recently, does that change the calculus in terms of how it will contribute to climate change, and whether you think it makes sense to go ahead with that project?
"
490,XL,"THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I don’t think I’ve minimized the benefits, I think I’ve described the benefits.  At issue in Keystone is not American oil.  It is Canadian oil that is drawn out of tar sands in Canada.  That oil currently is being shipped out through rail or trucks, and it would save Canadian oil companies and the Canadian oil industry an enormous amount of money if they could simply pipe it all the way through the United States down to the Gulf.  Once that oil gets to the Gulf, it is then entering into the world market, and it would be sold all around the world.  
"
491,XL,"So there’s no -- I won’t say “no” -- there is very little impact, nominal impact, on U.S. gas prices -- what the average American consumer cares about -- by having this pipeline come through.  And sometimes the way this gets sold is, let’s get this oil and it’s going to come here.  And the implication is, is that’s going to lower gas prices here in the United States.  It’s not.  There’s a global oil market.  It’s very good for Canadian oil companies and it’s good for the Canadian oil industry, but it’s not going to be a huge benefit to U.S. consumers.  It’s not even going to be a nominal benefit to U.S. consumers.
"
492,XL,"Now, the construction of the pipeline itself will create probably a couple thousand jobs.  Those are temporary jobs until the construction actually happens.  There’s probably some additional jobs that can be created in the refining process down in the Gulf.  Those aren’t completely insignificant -- it’s just like any other project.  But when you consider what we could be doing if we were rebuilding our roads and bridges around the country -- something that Congress could authorize -- we could probably create hundreds of thousands of jobs, or a million jobs. So if that’s the argument, there are a lot more direct ways to create well-paying Americans construction jobs.
"
493,XL,"And then, with respect to the cost, all I’ve said is that I want to make sure that if, in fact, this project goes forward, that it’s not adding to the problem of climate change, which I think is very serious and does impose serious costs on the American people -- some of them long term, but significant costs nonetheless.  If we’ve got more flooding, more wildfires, more drought, there are direct economic impacts on that.  
"
494,XL,"And as we’re now rebuilding after Sandy, for example, we’re having to consider how do we increase preparedness in how we structure infrastructure and housing, and so forth, along the Jersey Shore.  That’s an example of the kind of costs that are imposed, and you can put a dollar figure on it.
"
495,XL,"So, in terms of process, you’ve got a Nebraska judge that’s still determining whether or not the new path for this pipeline is appropriate.  Once that is resolved, then the State Department will have all the information it needs to make its decision.  
"
496,XL,"But I’ve just tried to give this perspective, because I think that there’s been this tendency to really hype this thing as some magic formula to what ails the U.S. economy, and it’s hard to see on paper where exactly they’re getting that information from.
"
497,XL,"In terms of oil prices and how it impacts the decision, I think that it won’t have a significant impact except perhaps in the minds of folks -- when gas prices are lower, maybe they’re less susceptible to the argument that this is the answer to lowering gas prices.  But it was never going to be the answer to lowering gas prices, because the oil that would be piped through the Keystone pipeline would go into the world market.  And that’s what determines oil prices, ultimately.
"
498,XL,"Q    And in terms of Congress forcing your hand on this, is this something where you clearly say you’re not going to let Congress force your hand on whether to approve or disapprove of this?
"
499,XL,"THE PRESIDENT:  I’ll see what they do.  We’ll take that up in the New Year.Q    Any New Year’s resolutions?
"
500,XL,"THE PRESIDENT:  I’ll ask -- April, go ahead.  
"
501,XL,"Q    Thank you, Mr. President.  Last question, I guess.  (Laughter.)  Six years ago this month, I asked you what was the state of black America in the Oval Office, and you said it was the “the best of times and the worst of times.”  You said it was the best of times in the sense that there was -- has never been more opportunity for African Americans to receive a good education, and the worst of times for unemployment and the lack of opportunity.  We're ending 2014.  What is the state of black America as we talk about those issues as well as racial issues in this country?
"
502,XL,"THE PRESIDENT:  Like the rest of America, black America in the aggregate is better off now than it was when I came into office.  The jobs that have been created, the people who’ve gotten health insurance, the housing equity that’s been recovered, the 401 pensions that have been recovered -- a lot of those folks are African American.  They’re better off than they were.
"
503,XL,"The gap between income and wealth of white and black America persists.  And we’ve got more work to do on that front.  I’ve been consistent in saying that this is a legacy of a troubled racial past of Jim Crow and slavery.  That’s not an excuse for black folks.  And I think the overwhelming majority of black people understand it’s not an excuse.  They’re working hard. They’re out there hustling and trying to get an education, trying to send their kids to college.  But they’re starting behind, oftentimes, in the race.
"
504,XL,"And what’s true for all Americans is we should be willing to provide people a hand up -- not a handout, but help folks get that good early childhood education, help them graduate from high school, help them afford college.  If they do, they’re going to be able to succeed, and that’s going to be good for all of us.
"
505,XL,"And we’ve seen some progress.  The education reforms that we’ve initiated are showing measurable results.  We have the highest high school graduation that we’ve seen in a very long time.  We are seeing record numbers of young people attending college.  In many states that have initiated reforms, you’re seeing progress in math scores and reading scores for African American and Latino students as well as the broader population.  But we’ve still got more work to go.Now, obviously, how we’re thinking about race relations right now has been colored by Ferguson, the Garner case in New York, a growing awareness in the broader population of what I think many communities of color have understood for some time, and that is that there are specific instances at least where law enforcement doesn’t feel as if it’s being applied in a colorblind fashion.  
"
506,XL,"The task force that I formed is supposed to report back to me in 90 days -- not with a bunch of abstract musings about race relations, but some really concrete, practical things that police departments and law enforcement agencies can begin implementing right now to rebuild trust between communities of color and the police department.
"
507,XL,"And my intention is to, as soon as I get those recommendations, to start implementing them.  Some of them we’ll be able to do through executive action.  Some of them will require congressional action.  Some of them will require action on the part of states and local jurisdictions.  
"
508,XL,"But I actually think it’s been a healthy conversation that we’ve had.  These are not new phenomenon.  The fact that they’re now surfacing, in part because people are able to film what have just been, in the past, stories passed on around a kitchen table, allows people to make their own assessments and evaluations.  And you’re not going to solve a problem if it’s not being talked about.
"
509,XL,"In the meantime, we’ve been moving forward on criminal justice reform issues more broadly.  One of the things I didn’t talk about in my opening statement is the fact that last year was the first time in 40 years where we had the federal prison population go down and the crime rate go down at the same time, which indicates the degree to which it’s possible for us to think smarter about who we’re incarcerating, how long we’re incarcerating, how are we dealing with nonviolent offenders, how are we dealing with drug offenses, diversion programs, drug courts.  We can do a better job of -- and save money in the process by initiating some of these reforms.  And I’ve been really pleased to see that we’ve had Republicans and Democrats in Congress who are interested in these issues as well.
"
510,XL,"The one thing I will say -- and this is going to be the last thing I say -- is that one of the great things about this job is you get to know the American people.  I mean, you meet folks from every walk of life and every region of the country, and every race and every faith.  And what I don’t think is always captured in our political debates is the vast majority of people are just trying to do the right thing, and people are basically good and have good intentions.  Sometimes our institutions and our systems don’t work as well as they should.  Sometimes you've got a police department that has gotten into bad habits over a period of time and hasn’t maybe surfaced some hidden biases that we all carry around.  But if you offer practical solutions, I think people want to fix these problems.  It’s not -- this isn’t a situation where people feel good seeing somebody choked and dying.  I think that troubles everybody.  So there’s an opportunity of all of us to come together and to take a practical approach to these problems.
"
511,XL,"And I guess that's my general theme for the end of the year -- which is we’ve gone through difficult times.  It is your job, press corps, to report on all the mistakes that are made and all the bad things that happen and the crises that look like they're popping.  And I understand that.  But through persistent effort and faith in the American people, things get better.  The economy has gotten better.  Our ability to generate clean energy has gotten better.  We know more about how to educate our kids.  We solved problems.  Ebola is a real crisis; you get a mistake in the first case because it’s not something that's been seen before -- we fix it.  You have some unaccompanied children who spike at a border, and it may not get fixed in the time frame of the news cycle, but it gets fixed.  
"
512,XL,"And part of what I hope as we reflect on the New Year this should generate is some confidence.  America knows how to solve problems.  And when we work together, we can't be stopped.  And now I’m going to go on vacation.  Mele Kalikimaka, everybody.  (Laughter.)  Mahalo.  Thank you, everybody. ####

514,XL,"A new Gallup Poll finds less than a quarter of Americans (23%) are satisfied with the way things are going in their country.But that didn't stop President Obama from pronouncing 2014 a really good year overall in his year-end news conference. ""My presidency is entering the fourth quarter,"" said president No. 44. ""Interesting stuff happens in the fourth quarter."" (Scroll down for a C-SPAN Library video of the entire news conference.)** The country has 759 days left of Obama in the Oval Office. Forget Gallup. ""There is no doubt that we can enter into the New Year with renewed confidence that America is making significant strides where it counts,"" Obama claimed. .And according to the lame duck chief executive, he's pumped about what he can still do:""In terms of my own job, I'm energized, I'm excited about the prospects for the next couple of years, and I'm certainly not going to be stopping for a minute in the effort to make life better for ordinary Americans.""** ""I’m being absolutely sincere when I say I want to work with this new (Republican) Congress to get things done.""

They aren't.** ""Like the rest of America, black America in the aggregate is better off now than it was when I came into office."" That's breaking news for all the unemployed African Americans. November unemployment nationally was 5.8%.

We've really got a full house today, huh? Well, all I want for Christmas is to take your questions. (Laughter.) But first let me say a little bit about this year.In last year’s final press conference, I said that 2014 would be a year of action and would be a breakthrough year for America. And it has been. Yes, there were crises that we had to tackle around the world, many that were unanticipated. We have more work to do to make sure our economy, our justice system, and our government work not just for the few, but for the many. But there is no doubt that we can enter into the New Year with renewed confidence that America is making significant strides where it counts.The steps that we took early on to rescue our economy and rebuild it on a new foundation helped make 2014 the strongest year for job growth since the 1990s.  All told, over a 57-month streak, our businesses have created nearly 11 million new jobs.  Almost all the job growth that we’ve seen have been in full-time positions.  Much of the recent pickup in job growth has been in higher-paying industries.  And in a hopeful sign for middle-class families, wages are on the rise again.Our investments in American manufacturing have helped fuel its best stretch of job growth also since the 1990s.  America is now the number-one producer of oil, the number-one producer of natural gas.  We're saving drivers about 70 cents a gallon at the pump over last Christmas.  And effectively today, our rescue of the auto industry is officially over.  We've now repaid taxpayers every dime and more of what my administration committed, and the American auto industry is on track for its strongest year since 2005.  And we've created about half a million new jobs in the auto industry alone.Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, about 10 million Americans have gained health insurance just this past year.  Enrollment is beginning to pick up again during the open enrollment period.  The uninsured rate is at a near record low.  Since the law passed, the price of health care has risen at its slowest rate in about 50 years.  And we’ve cut our deficits by about two-thirds since I took office, bringing them to below their 40-year average.Meanwhile, around the world, America is leading.  We’re leading the coalition to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL -- a coalition that includes Arab partners.  We’re leading the international community to check Russian aggression in Ukraine. We are leading the global fight to combat Ebola in West Africa, and we are preventing an outbreak from taking place here at home. We’re leading efforts to address climate change, including last month’s joint announcement with China that’s already jump-starting new progress in other countries.  We’re writing a new chapter in our leadership here in the Americas by turning a new page on our relationship with the Cuban people.  And in less than two weeks, after more than 13 years, our combat mission in Afghanistan will be over.  Today, more of our troops are home for the holidays than any time in over a decade. Still, many of our men and women in uniform will spend Christmas in harm’s way.  And they should know that the country is united in support of you and grateful not only to you but also to your families.The six years since the crisis have demanded hard work and sacrifice on everybody’s part.  But as a country, we have every right to be proud of what we’ve accomplished -- more jobs; more people insured; a growing economy; shrinking deficits; bustling industry; booming energy.  Pick any metric that you want -- America’s resurgence is real.  We are better off.I’ve always said that recovering from the crisis of 2008 was our first order of business, and on that business, America has outperformed all of our other competitors.  Over the past four years, we’ve put more people back to work than all other advanced economies combined.  We’ve now come to a point where we have the chance to reverse an even deeper problem, the decades-long erosion of middle-class jobs and incomes, and to make sure that the middle class is the engine that powers our prosperity for decades to come.To do that, we're going to have to make some smart choices; we've got to make the right choices.  We're going to have to invest in the things that secure even faster growth in higher-paying jobs for more Americans.  And I’m being absolutely sincere when I say I want to work with this new Congress to get things done, to make those investments, to make sure the government is working better and smarter.  We're going to disagree on some things, but there are going to be areas of agreement and we've got to be able to make that happen.  And that's going to involve compromise every once in a while, and we saw during this lame duck period that perhaps that spirit of compromise may be coming to the fore.In terms of my own job, I'm energized, I'm excited about the prospects for the next couple of years, and I'm certainly not going to be stopping for a minute in the effort to make life better for ordinary Americans.  Because, thanks to their efforts, we really do have a new foundation that's been laid.  We are better positioned than we have been in a very long time.  A new future is ready to be written.  We've set the stage for this American moment.  And I'm going to spend every minute of my last two years making sure that we seize it.My presidency is entering the fourth quarter; interesting stuff happens in the fourth quarter.  And I'm looking forward to it.  But going into the fourth quarter, you usually get a timeout.  I'm now looking forward to a quiet timeout -- Christmas with my family.  So I want to wish everybody a Merry Christmas, a Happy Hanukkah, a Happy New Year.  I hope that all of you get some time to spend with your families as well, because one thing that we share is that we're away too much from them.And now, Josh has given me the “who’s been naughty and who’s been nice” list -- (laughter) -- and I'm going to use it to take some questions.  And we're going to start with Carrie Budoff Brown of Politico. There you go, Carrie.Q: Thank you, Mr. President.  I’ll start on North Korea -- that seems to be the biggest topic today.  What does a proportional response look like to the Sony hack?  And did Sony make the right decision in pulling the movie?  Or does that set a dangerous precedent when faced with this kind of situation?THE PRESIDENT:  Well, let me address the second question first.  Sony is a corporation.  It suffered significant damage.  There were threats against its employees.  I am sympathetic to the concerns that they faced.  Having said all that, yes, I think they made a mistake.In this interconnected, digital world, there are going to be opportunities for hackers to engage in cyber assaults both in the private sector and the public sector.  Now, our first order of business is making sure that we do everything to harden sites and prevent those kinds of attacks from taking place.  When I came into office, I stood up a cyber-security interagency team to look at everything that we could at the government level to prevent these kinds of attacks.  We’ve been coordinating with the private sector, but a lot more needs to be done.  We’re not even close to where we need to be. And one of the things in the New Year that I hope Congress is prepared to work with us on is strong cyber-security laws that allow for information-sharing across private sector platforms, as well as the public sector, so that we are incorporating best practices and preventing these attacks from happening in the first place.But even as we get better, the hackers are going to get better, too.  Some of them are going to be state actors; some of them are going to be non-state actors.  All of them are going to be sophisticated and many of them can do some damage.We cannot have a society in which some dictator someplace can start imposing censorship here in the United States.  Because if somebody is able to intimidate folks out of releasing a satirical movie, imagine what they start doing when they see a documentary that they don’t like, or news reports that they don’t like. Or even worse, imagine if producers and distributors and others start engaging in self-censorship because they don’t want to offend the sensibilities of somebody whose sensibilities probably need to be offended.So that’s not who we are.  That’s not what America is about.Again, I’m sympathetic that Sony as a private company was worried about liabilities, and this and that and the other.  I wish they had spoken to me first.  I would have told them, do not get into a pattern in which you’re intimidated by these kinds of criminal attacks.  Imagine if, instead of it being a cyber-threat, somebody had broken into their offices and destroyed a bunch of computers and stolen disks.  Is that what it takes for suddenly you to pull the plug on something?So we’ll engage with not just the film industry, but the news industry and the private sector around these issues.  We already have.  We will continue to do so.  But I think all of us have to anticipate occasionally there are going to be breaches like this.  They’re going to be costly.  They’re going to be serious.  We take them with the utmost seriousness.  But we can’t start changing our patterns of behavior any more than we stop going to a football game because there might be the possibility of a terrorist attack; any more than Boston didn’t run its marathon this year because of the possibility that somebody might try to cause harm.  So let’s not get into that way of doing business.Q    Can you just say what the response would be to this attack?  Would you consider taking some sort of symbolic step like watching the movie yourself or doing some sort of screening here that -- THE PRESIDENT:  I’ve got a long list of movies I’m going to be watching.  (Laughter.)Q Will this be one of them?THE PRESIDENT:  I never release my full movie list. But let’s talk of the specifics of what we now know.  The FBI announced today and we can confirm that North Korea engaged in this attack.  I think it says something interesting about North Korea that they decided to have the state mount an all-out assault on a movie studio because of a satirical movie starring Seth Rogen and James Flacco [Franco].  (Laughter.)  I love Seth and I love James, but the notion that that was a threat to them I think gives you some sense of the kind of regime we’re talking about here.They caused a lot of damage, and we will respond.  We will respond proportionally, and we’ll respond in a place and time and manner that we choose.  It’s not something that I will announce here today at a press conference.More broadly, though, this points to the need for us to work with the international community to start setting up some very clear rules of the road in terms of how the Internet and cyber operates.  Right now, it’s sort of the Wild West.  And part of the problem is, is you’ve got weak states that can engage in these kinds of attacks, you’ve got non-state actors that can do enormous damage.  That’s part of what makes this issue of cyber-security so urgent.Again, this is part of the reason why it’s going to be so important for Congress to work with us and get a actual bill passed that allows for the kind of information-sharing we need.  Because if we don’t put in place the kind of architecture that can prevent these attacks from taking place, this is not just going to be affecting movies, this is going to be affecting our entire economy in ways that are extraordinarily significant.And, by the way, I hear you’re moving to Europe.  Where you going to be? Brussels.Q    Yes.  Helping Politico start a new publication.  THE PRESIDENT:  Well, congratulations.  Q    I’ve been covering you since the beginning.THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think --Q    It’s been a long road for the both of us.THE PRESIDENT:  I think there’s no doubt that what Belgium needs is a version of Politico.  (Laughter.)  Q    I’ll take that as an endorsement.  THE PRESIDENT:  The waffles are delicious there, by the way. Cheryl Bolen.  You’ve been naughty.  (Laughter.)  Cheryl, go ahead.Q    Thank you, Mr. President.  Looking ahead to your work with Congress next year, you’ve mentioned as an area of possible compromise tax reform.  And so I am wondering, do you see a Republican Congress as presenting a better opportunity for actually getting tax reform next year?  Will you be putting out a new proposal?  Are you willing to consider both individual and corporate side of the tax ledger there?  And also, are you still concerned about corporate inversions?THE PRESIDENT:  I think an all-Democratic Congress would have provided an even better opportunity for tax reform.  But I think, talking to Speaker Boehner and Leader McConnell that they are serious about wanting to get some things done.  The tax area is........one area where we can get things done.  And I think in the coming weeks leading up to the State of Union, there will be some conversations at the staff levels about what principles each side are looking at.I can tell you broadly what I’d like to see.  I’d like to see more simplicity in the system.  I’d like to see more fairness in the system.  With respect to the corporate tax reform issue, we know that there are companies that are paying the full freight -- 35 percent -- higher than just about any other company on Earth, if you're paying 35 percent, and then there are other companies that are paying zero because they’ve got better accountants or lawyers.  That's not fair.  There are companies that are parking money outside the country because of tax avoidance.  We think that it’s important that everybody pays something if, in fact, they are effectively headquartered in the United States.  In terms of corporate inversion, those are situations where companies really are headquartered here but, on paper, switch their headquarters to see if they can avoid paying their fair share of taxes.  I think that needs to be fixed.  So, fairness, everybody paying their fair share, everybody taking responsibility I think is going to be very important.  Some of those principles I’ve heard Republicans say they share.  How we do that -- the devil is in the details.  And I’ll be interested in seeing what they want to move forward.  I’m going to make sure that we put forward some pretty specific proposals building on what we’ve already put forward.One other element of this that I think is important is -- and I’ve been on this hobby horse now for six years.  (Audience member sneezes.)  Bless you.  We’ve got a lot of infrastructure we’ve got to rebuild in this country if we're going to be competitive -- roads, bridges, ports, airports, electrical grids, water systems, sewage systems.  We are way behind.  And early on we indicated that there is a way of us potentially doing corporate tax reform, lowering rates, eliminating loopholes so everybody is paying their fair share, and during that transition also providing a mechanism where we can get some infrastructure built.  I’d like to see us work on that issue as well.  Historically, obviously, infrastructure has not been a Democratic or a Republican issue, and I’d like to see if we can return to that tradition. Julie Pace.Q    Thank you, Mr. President.  I wanted to ask about Cuba. What would you say to dissidents or democracy advocates inside Cuba who fear that the policy changes you announced this week could give the Castro regime economic benefits without having to address human rights or their political system?  When your administration was lifting sanctions on Myanmar you sought commitments of reform.  Why not do the same with Cuba?And if I could just follow up on North Korea.  Do you have any indication that North Korea was acting in conjunction with another country, perhaps China?THE PRESIDENT:  We’ve got no indication that North Korea was acting in conjunction with another country.With respect to Cuba, we are glad that the Cuban government have released slightly over 50 dissidents; that they are going to be allowing the International Committee of the Red Cross and the United Nations human rights agencies to operate more freely inside of Cuba and monitor what is taking place.I share the concerns of dissidents there and human rights activists that this is still a regime that represses its people. And as I said when I made the announcement, I don’t anticipate overnight changes, but what I know deep in my bones is that if you’ve done the same thing for 50 years and nothing has changed, you should try something different if you want a different outcome.And this gives us an opportunity for a different outcome, because suddenly Cuba is open to the world in ways that it has not been before.  It’s open to Americans traveling there in ways that it hasn’t been before.  It’s open to church groups visiting their fellow believers inside of Cuba in ways they haven't been before.  It offers the prospect of telecommunications and the Internet being more widely available in Cuba in ways that it hasn’t been before.And over time, that chips away at this hermetically sealed society, and I believe offers the best prospect then of leading to greater freedom, greater self-determination on the part of the Cuban people.  I think it will happen in fits and starts.  But through engagement, we have a better chance of bringing about change then we would have otherwise.Q    Do you have a goal for where you see Cuba being at the end of your presidency?THE PRESIDENT:  I think it would be unrealistic for me to map out exactly where Cuba will be.  But change is going to come to Cuba.  It has to.  They’ve got an economy that doesn’t work.  They’ve been reliant for years first on subsidies from the Soviet Union, then on subsidies from Venezuela.  Those can’t be sustained.  And the more the Cuban people see what’s possible, the more interested they are going to be in change.  But how societies change is country-specific, it’s culturally specific.  It could happen fast; it could happen slower than I’d like; but it’s going to happen.  And I think this change in policy is going to advance that. Lesley Clark.Q    Thank you, Mr. President.  I had a number of questions on Cuba as well.  Appreciate that.  I wanted to --THE PRESIDENT:  Do I have to write all these down?  How many are there?  (Laughter.)  “A number” sounded intimidating.Q    As quick as I can.  As quick as I can.  I wanted to see if you got an assurances from the Cuban government that it would not revert to the same sort of -- sabotage the deal, as it has in the past when past Presidents had made similar overtures to the government.THE PRESIDENT:  Meaning?  Be specific.  What do you mean?Q    When the Clinton administration made some overtures, they shot down planes.  They sort of had this pattern of doing provocative -- provocative events.THE PRESIDENT:  Okay, so just general provocative activity.Q    Provocative activities any time the U.S. has sort of reached out a hand to them.  I wanted to see what is your knowledge of whether Fidel Castro -- did he have any role in the talks?  When you talked to President Raul Castro, did Fidel Castro’s name come up?  Or did you ask about him?  How he’s doing?  People haven't seen him in a while.  Given the deep opposition from some Republicans in Congress to lifting the embargo, to an embassy, to any of the changes that you’re doing, are you going to personally get involved in terms of talking to them about efforts that they want to do to block money on a new embassy?THE PRESIDENT:  All right, Lesley, I think I’m going to cut you off here.  (Laughter.)  This is taking up a lot of time.Q    Okay, all right.THE PRESIDENT:  All right.  So, with respect to sabotage, I mean, my understanding of the history, for example, of the plane being shot down, it’s not clear that that was the Cuban government purposely trying to undermine overtures by the Clinton administration.  It was a tragic circumstance that ended up collapsing talks that had begun to take place.  I haven't seen a historical record that suggests that they shot the plane down specifically in order to undermine overtures by the Clinton government.I think it is not precedented for the President of the United States and the President of Cuba to make an announcement at the same time that they are moving towards normalizing relations.  So there hasn’t been anything like this in the past. That doesn’t mean that over the next two years we can anticipate them taking certain actions that we may end up finding deeply troubling either inside of Cuba or with respect to their foreign policy.  And that could put significant strains on the relationship.  But that’s true of a lot of countries out there where we have an embassy.  And the whole point of normalizing relations is that it gives us a greater opportunity to have influence with that government than not.  So I would be surprised if the Cuban government purposely tries to undermine what is now effectively its own policy.  I wouldn’t be surprised if they take at any given time actions that we think are a problem. And we will be in a position to respond to whatever actions they take the same way we do with a whole range of countries around the world when they do things we think are wrong.  But the point is, is that we will be in a better position I think to actually have some influence, and there may be carrots as well as sticks that we can then apply.The only way that Fidel’s name came up -- I think I may have mentioned this in the Davie Muir article -- interview that I did -- was I delivered a fairly lengthy statement at the front end about how we’re looking forward to a new future in the relationship between our two countries, but that we are going to continue to press on issues of democracy and human rights, which we think are important.  My opening remarks probably took about 15 minutes, which on the phone is a pretty long time.  And at the end of that, he said, Mr. President, you’re still a young man.  Perhaps you have the -- at the end of my remarks I apologized for taking such a long time, but I wanted to make sure that before we engaged in the conversation he was very clear about where I stood.  He said, oh, don’t worry about it, Mr. President, you’re still a young man and you have still the chance to break Fidel’s record -- he once spoke seven hours straight.  (Laughter.)And then, President Castro proceeded to deliver his own preliminary remarks that last at least twice as long as mine.  (Laughter.)  And then I was able to say, obviously it runs in the family.  But that was the only discussion of Fidel Castro that we had. I sort of forgot all the other questions.  (Laughter.)  Q    I have a few more if you’re -- how personally involved are you going to get in -- THE PRESIDENT:  With respect to Congress?  We cannot unilaterally bring down the embargo.  That’s codified in the Libertad Act.  And what I do think is going to happen, though, is there’s going to be a process where Congress digests it.  There are bipartisan supporters of our new approach, there are bipartisan detractors of this new approach.  People will see how the actions we take unfold.  And I think there’s going to be a healthy debate inside of Congress.  And I will certainly weigh in.  I think that ultimately we need to go ahead and pull down the embargo, which I think has been self-defeating in advancing the aims that we’re interested in.  But I don’t anticipate that that happens right away.  I think people are going to want to see how does this move forward before there’s any serious debate about whether or not we would make major shifts in the embargo. Roberta Rampton.Q    I want to follow on that by asking, under what conditions would you meet with President Castro in Havana? Would you have certain preconditions that you would want to see met before doing that?  And on the hack, I know that you said that you’re not going to announce your response, but can you say whether you’re considering additional economic or financial sanctions on North Korea?  Can you rule out the use of military force or some kind of cyber hit of your own?THE PRESIDENT:  I think I’m going to leave it where I left it, which is we just confirmed that it was North Korea; we have been working up a range of options.  They will be presented to me.  I will make a decision on those based on what I believe is proportional and appropriate to the nature of this crime.With respect to Cuba, we’re not at a stage here where me visiting Cuba or President Castro coming to the United States is in the cards.  I don’t know how this relationship will develop over the next several years.  I’m a fairly young man so I imagine that at some point in my life I will have the opportunity to visit Cuba and enjoy interacting with the Cuban people.  But there’s nothing specific where we're trying to target some sort of visit on my part. Colleen McCain Nelson.Q    Thank you, Mr. President. THE PRESIDENT:  There you are. Q    You spoke earlier about 2014 being a breakthrough year, and you ended the year with executive actions on Cuba and immigration and climate change.  But you didn't make much progress this year on your legislative agenda.  And some Republican lawmakers have said they're less inclined to work with you if you pursue executive actions so aggressively.  Are you going to continue to pursue executive actions if that creates more roadblocks for your legislative agenda?  Or have you concluded that it’s not possible to break the fever in Washington and the partisan gridlock here?THE PRESIDENT:  I think there are real opportunities to get things done in Congress.  As I said before, I take Speaker Boehner and Mitch McConnell at their words that they want to get things done.  I think the American people would like to see us get some things done.  The question is going to be are we able to separate out those areas where we disagree and those areas where we agree.  I think there are going to be some tough fights on areas where we disagree.  If Republicans seek to take health care away from people who just got it, they will meet stiff resistance from me.  If they try to water down consumer protections that we put in place in the aftermath of the financial crisis, I will say no.  And I’m confident that I’ll be able to uphold vetoes of those types of provisions.  But on increasing American exports, on simplifying our tax system, on rebuilding our infrastructure, my hope is that we can get some things done.  I’ve never been persuaded by this argument that if it weren’t for the executive actions they would have been more productive.  There’s no evidence of that.  So I intend to continue to do what I’ve been doing, which is where I see a big problem and the opportunity to help the American people, and it is within my lawful authority to provide that help, I’m going to do it.  And I will then, side-by-side, reach out to members of Congress, reach out to Republicans, and say, let’s work together; I’d rather do it with you.Immigration is the classic example.  I was really happy when the Senate passed a bipartisan, comprehensive immigration bill.  And I did everything I could for a year and a half to provide Republicans the space to act, and showed not only great patience, but flexibility, saying to them, look, if there are specific changes you’d like to see, we're willing to compromise, we're willing to be patient, we're willing to work with you.  Ultimately it wasn’t forthcoming.And so the question is going to be I think if executive actions on areas like minimum wage, or equal pay, or having a more sensible immigration system are important to Republicans, if they care about those issues, and the executive actions are bothering them, there is a very simple solution, and that is:  Pass bills.  And work with me to make sure I’m willing to sign those bills.  Because both sides are going to have to compromise.  On most issues, in order for their initiatives to become law, I’m going to have sign off.  And that means they have to take into account the issues that I care about, just as I’m going to have to take into account the issues that they care about. All right.  I think this is going to be our last question.  Juliet Eilperin.  There you go. Q    Thanks so much.  So one of the first bills that Mitch McConnell said he will send to you is one that would authorize the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline.  When you talked about this in the past, you’ve minimized the benefits and you highlighted some of the risks associated with that project.  I’m wondering if you could tell us both what you would do when faced with that bill, given the Republican majority that we’ll have in both chambers.  And also, what do you see as the benefits?  And given the precipitous drop we’ve seen in oil prices recently, does that change the calculus in terms of how it will contribute to climate change, and whether you think it makes sense to go ahead with that project?THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I don’t think I’ve minimized the benefits, I think I’ve described the benefits.  At issue in Keystone is not American oil.  It is Canadian oil that is drawn out of tar sands in Canada.  That oil currently is being shipped out through rail or trucks, and it would save Canadian oil companies and the Canadian oil industry an enormous amount of money if they could simply pipe it all the way through the United States down to the Gulf.  Once that oil gets to the Gulf, it is then entering into the world market, and it would be sold all around the world.  So there’s no -- I won’t say “no” -- there is very little impact, nominal impact, on U.S. gas prices -- what the average American consumer cares about -- by having this pipeline come through.  And sometimes the way this gets sold is, let’s get this oil and it’s going to come here.  And the implication is, is that’s going to lower gas prices here in the United States.  It’s not.  There’s a global oil market.  It’s very good for Canadian oil companies and it’s good for the Canadian oil industry, but it’s not going to be a huge benefit to U.S. consumers.  It’s not even going to be a nominal benefit to U.S. consumers.Now, the construction of the pipeline itself will create probably a couple thousand jobs.  Those are temporary jobs until the construction actually happens.  There’s probably some additional jobs that can be created in the refining process down in the Gulf.  Those aren’t completely insignificant -- it’s just like any other project.  But when you consider what we could be doing if we were rebuilding our roads and bridges around the country -- something that Congress could authorize -- we could probably create hundreds of thousands of jobs, or a million jobs. So if that’s the argument, there are a lot more direct ways to create well-paying Americans construction jobs.And then, with respect to the cost, all I’ve said is that I want to make sure that if, in fact, this project goes forward, that it’s not adding to the problem of climate change, which I think is very serious and does impose serious costs on the American people -- some of them long term, but significant costs nonetheless.  If we’ve got more flooding, more wildfires, more drought, there are direct economic impacts on that.  And as we’re now rebuilding after Sandy, for example, we’re having to consider how do we increase preparedness in how we structure infrastructure and housing, and so forth, along the Jersey Shore.  That’s an example of the kind of costs that are imposed, and you can put a dollar figure on it.So, in terms of process, you’ve got a Nebraska judge that’s still determining whether or not the new path for this pipeline is appropriate.  Once that is resolved, then the State Department will have all the information it needs to make its decision.  But I’ve just tried to give this perspective, because I think that there’s been this tendency to really hype this thing as some magic formula to what ails the U.S. economy, and it’s hard to see on paper where exactly they’re getting that information from.In terms of oil prices and how it impacts the decision, I think that it won’t have a significant impact except perhaps in the minds of folks -- when gas prices are lower, maybe they’re less susceptible to the argument that this is the answer to lowering gas prices.  But it was never going to be the answer to lowering gas prices, because the oil that would be piped through the Keystone pipeline would go into the world market.  And that’s what determines oil prices, ultimately.Q    And in terms of Congress forcing your hand on this, is this something where you clearly say you’re not going to let Congress force your hand on whether to approve or disapprove of this?THE PRESIDENT:  I’ll see what they do.  We’ll take that up in the New Year.Q    Any New Year’s resolutions?THE PRESIDENT:  I’ll ask -- April, go ahead.  Q    Thank you, Mr. President.  Last question, I guess.  (Laughter.)  Six years ago this month, I asked you what was the state of black America in the Oval Office, and you said it was the “the best of times and the worst of times.”  You said it was the best of times in the sense that there was -- has never been more opportunity for African Americans to receive a good education, and the worst of times for unemployment and the lack of opportunity.  We're ending 2014.  What is the state of black America as we talk about those issues as well as racial issues in this country?THE PRESIDENT:  Like the rest of America, black America in the aggregate is better off now than it was when I came into office.  The jobs that have been created, the people who’ve gotten health insurance, the housing equity that’s been recovered, the 401 pensions that have been recovered -- a lot of those folks are African American.  They’re better off than they were.The gap between income and wealth of white and black America persists.  And we’ve got more work to do on that front.  I’ve been consistent in saying that this is a legacy of a troubled racial past of Jim Crow and slavery.  That’s not an excuse for black folks.  And I think the overwhelming majority of black people understand it’s not an excuse.  They’re working hard. They’re out there hustling and trying to get an education, trying to send their kids to college.  But they’re starting behind, oftentimes, in the race.And what’s true for all Americans is we should be willing to provide people a hand up -- not a handout, but help folks get that good early childhood education, help them graduate from high school, help them afford college.  If they do, they’re going to be able to succeed, and that’s going to be good for all of us.And we’ve seen some progress.  The education reforms that we’ve initiated are showing measurable results.  We have the highest high school graduation that we’ve seen in a very long time.  We are seeing record numbers of young people attending college.  In many states that have initiated reforms, you’re seeing progress in math scores and reading scores for African American and Latino students as well as the broader population.  But we’ve still got more work to go.Now, obviously, how we’re thinking about race relations right now has been colored by Ferguson, the Garner case in New York, a growing awareness in the broader population of what I think many communities of color have understood for some time, and that is that there are specific instances at least where law enforcement doesn’t feel as if it’s being applied in a colorblind fashion.  The task force that I formed is supposed to report back to me in 90 days -- not with a bunch of abstract musings about race relations, but some really concrete, practical things that police departments and law enforcement agencies can begin implementing right now to rebuild trust between communities of color and the police department.And my intention is to, as soon as I get those recommendations, to start implementing them.  Some of them we’ll be able to do through executive action.  Some of them will require congressional action.  Some of them will require action on the part of states and local jurisdictions.  But I actually think it’s been a healthy conversation that we’ve had.  These are not new phenomenon.  The fact that they’re now surfacing, in part because people are able to film what have just been, in the past, stories passed on around a kitchen table, allows people to make their own assessments and evaluations.  And you’re not going to solve a problem if it’s not being talked about.In the meantime, we’ve been moving forward on criminal justice reform issues more broadly.  One of the things I didn’t talk about in my opening statement is the fact that last year was the first time in 40 years where we had the federal prison population go down and the crime rate go down at the same time, which indicates the degree to which it’s possible for us to think smarter about who we’re incarcerating, how long we’re incarcerating, how are we dealing with nonviolent offenders, how are we dealing with drug offenses, diversion programs, drug courts.  We can do a better job of -- and save money in the process by initiating some of these reforms.  And I’ve been really pleased to see that we’ve had Republicans and Democrats in Congress who are interested in these issues as well.The one thing I will say -- and this is going to be the last thing I say -- is that one of the great things about this job is you get to know the American people.  I mean, you meet folks from every walk of life and every region of the country, and every race and every faith.  And what I don’t think is always captured in our political debates is the vast majority of people are just trying to do the right thing, and people are basically good and have good intentions.  Sometimes our institutions and our systems don’t work as well as they should.  Sometimes you've got a police department that has gotten into bad habits over a period of time and hasn’t maybe surfaced some hidden biases that we all carry around.  But if you offer practical solutions, I think people want to fix these problems.  It’s not -- this isn’t a situation where people feel good seeing somebody choked and dying.  I think that troubles everybody.  So there’s an opportunity of all of us to come together and to take a practical approach to these problems.And I guess that's my general theme for the end of the year -- which is we’ve gone through difficult times.  It is your job, press corps, to report on all the mistakes that are made and all the bad things that happen and the crises that look like they're popping.  And I understand that.  But through persistent effort and faith in the American people, things get better.  The economy has gotten better.  Our ability to generate clean energy has gotten better.  We know more about how to educate our kids.  We solved problems.  Ebola is a real crisis; you get a mistake in the first case because it’s not something that's been seen before -- we fix it.  You have some unaccompanied children who spike at a border, and it may not get fixed in the time frame of the news cycle, but it gets fixed.  And part of what I hope as we reflect on the New Year this should generate is some confidence.  America knows how to solve problems.  And when we work together, we can't be stopped.  And now I’m going to go on vacation.  Mele Kalikimaka, everybody.  (Laughter.)  Mahalo.  Thank you, everybody. ####Video courtesy of the C-SPAN Video Library.

516,XL,"Energy Policy: Hours before the president who stalled the Keystone XL pipeline arrived in Beijing, Russia and China signed 16 energy agreements, including one to supply Russian natural gas to its energy-hungry neighbor.Chinese President Xi Jinping's meeting Sunday night with Russian President Vladimir Putin was the 10th between the two since Xi took China's helm 20 months ago. They talked energy, the critical role of which in world affairs they, if not the Obama administration, seem to recognize.The 16 agreements that they inked included one dealing with a western pipeline, the Altai route, to carry 30 billion cubic meters (bcm) of Russian natural gas to China annually, part of a framework agreement between Russian energy giant Gazprom and the state-run China National Petroleum.The new energy supply line complements an already announced pipeline in the east, dubbed the Power of Siberia, which will supply 38 bcm annually to China. Work on that route began after a $400 billion deal was signed in May.Yang Cheng of the Center for Russian Studies in Shanghai said of the agreements that they represent ""the shared pursuit of major emerging economies seeking a greater capability to shape the international and regional order.""Both Russia and China are expansionist powers, with Putin seeking to reassemble the lost Soviet empire and China pursuing territorial ambitions in the East and South China Seas.Shaping the international and regional order is the furthest thing from President Obama's mind as America withdraws from the world stage, while China and Russia rush to fill the power vacuum that we have created.To Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry, fossil fuel, including natural gas, contributes to climate change and is a threat greater than Russia, China or Islamist terrorism.Elections have consequences, as the president has noted, and the 2014 midterms mean that approval of the Keystone XL pipeline from Canada to our Gulf Coast refineries may be the very first piece of legislation that the new Republican Congress places on Obama's desk.Asked about it at his post-election news conference last Wednesday, Obama once again said there was a ""process that's moving forward, (and) I'm going to let the process play out.""The question, he said, is whether the pipeline is ""something that doesn't increase climate change that we're going to have to deal with,"" and he was going to ""gather up the facts.""He's had six years to gather up the facts as the process played out. The facts are in, and they are that the State Department, tasked with examining and approving the international pipeline, has repeatedly approved it, with the latest report last January again affirming in its fifth and final environmental impact statement that the pipeline itself would have no net detrimental impact.Obama added, ""While this debate about Canadian oil has been raging . . . we've seen some of the biggest increases in American oil production and American natural gas production in our history.""True enough, but it's an increase he had nothing to do with. The increase is due to the use of a free-market technology called fracking, which his environmental base opposes, to develop oil and gas on private and state lands, as federal lands remain off limits.Keystone is not just about Canadian oil. As we've noted, the pipeline would not only carry oil from Canada to U.S. refineries, but also have a link to the Bakken formation oilfields of North Dakota.Most of the oil must now be shipped by dangerous rail tank cars. Many rail shipments from the Bakken fields are being handled by BNSF Railway, owned by Obama's favorite one-percenter, Warren Buffett.Get that bill ready, Congress. It's time that we pursue our energy and national security interests as diligently as the Russians and Chinese.

517,XL,"One clear winner on election night was energy. While the economy may have been voters' primary concern and the president's health care law second, energy issues played a key role, especially in those states that gave Republicans control of the Senate.It's a message that those newly elected senators, all of whom stressed their support for expanding energy development, aren't likely to forget. And it's one that Senate Majority Leader-elect Mitch McConnell, who repeatedly stressed his support for the Kentucky coal industry in his campaign, will push to the forefront.First should come the easy stuff. There is bipartisan support for approving the Keystone XL oil pipeline. President Obama has delayed this privately financed infrastructure project for several years, even though his own State Department determined that there would be no environmental damage. And Canada has been sending oil from Alberta to refineries in Illinois for four years through the first phases of the Keystone pipeline system.All the Keystone XL does is run a second pipeline from Alberta through Montana, connecting to the existing Keystone pipeline in Nebraska, and picking up 100,000 barrels a day in Montana while it's at it.Obama clearly does not want to approve the Keystone, or else he would have done it. But would he veto legislation approving it? Maybe, but there might be enough bipartisan support to override his veto. Many elected Democrats, seeing their colleagues booted out over failure to take a stand for energy, could be willing to buck the president on this issue.The second easy step is to allow crude oil and natural gas exports. In the mid-1970s, when U.S. oil and gas production was declining and gas lines were forming, Congress passed legislation prohibiting most crude oil and natural gas exports. Today, we have become the world's largest producer of natural gas and the top oil producer in a year or two. Indeed, our current problem is surpluses, not shortages.Ironically, the export ban covers crude oil, which you can't safely put in your gas tank, but there is no export ban on gasoline, which you can.There is bipartisan support for ending the export ban — Obama's secretary of energy even suggested it — and it would put the U.S. back in control of world energy policy, along with its foreign policy implications, for the first time in half a century.Third, the Obama administration should be pushed to approve more applications for drilling on federal land and offshore. Most of the drilling that has spurred several state economies has been on private or state-controlled land, where Washington has no say.But there are countless energy sources to tap on federal land and offshore that the administration has denied, stalled or slow-walked. Congress could help by passing legislation stipulating that drilling permits will be deemed approved unless the controlling agencies object within a specific amount of time.While those options would increase federal revenues and spur state economies and job growth, Congress should take a separate action that would save tax dollars: cut most or all of Obama's subsidies for renewable energy projects. Obama's clean-energy handouts have been an unmitigated disaster, so that words like ""Solyndra"" — a defunct solar energy company that cost taxpayers half a billion dollars — have become synonymous with waste and government incompetence.Where to start? The first step is to not reauthorize the Production Tax Credit (PTC) that provides billions of taxpayer dollars for wind turbines. The PTC died last year after 20 years of taxpayer life support, but there is a bipartisan effort to bring it back in the lame duck Congress.The Senate Finance Committee has already approved an $85.3 billion tax-extender bill that Congress is likely to take up in December.The bill provides $19.6 billion almost entirely for renewable energy projects, including $13.3 billion for the PTC. Congress should approve most of the extenders — with a promise of comprehensive tax reform soon — but drop the crony environmentalism.The U.S. has become the world's energy powerhouse; it's time to act like the global leader that we are. We have the technology to expand energy production, which would have the additional benefit of providing jobs, growing the economy and enhancing national security.Thanks to the election, we also have the elected representatives to get the job done. Matthews is a resident scholar with the Institute for Policy Innovation in Dallas.

As we consider their sacrifices, let us vow to live up to the promises that we’ve made to them and their families.We cannot rest until our veterans have the 21st-century health care system they deserve. It is the least a grateful nation can do. (Scroll down for full video of these remarks.)This is also a time to consider the line in Scripture that says, “to whom much is given, much is expected.” Republicans are humbled by the trust the American people have placed in us.We’ll honor that trust by listening to you, by making your priorities our priorities.That means focusing first on helping middle-class families still struggling to pay the bills and find good-paying jobs.We’ll start by debating and voting on the many jobs bills the House has acted on with bipartisan support. We’ll work to approve the Keystone XL pipeline, which will mean lower energy costs for families and more jobs for American workers.We’ll advance the Hire More Heroes Act, which will encourage employers to hire more of our nation’s veterans.And we’ll take on ObamaCare regulations that threaten the 40-hour workweek and the pay and peace of mind of so many Americans.These types of common-sense solutions, so long ignored by the outgoing Senate majority, offer a good starting point. They’ll help break the logjam here in Washington, and establish a foundation of certainty and stability that both parties can build on.From there, more good ideas will follow, and with them, a chance to address some of the most pressing challenges that we face, whether it’s a broken tax code that’s driving jobs overseas, health care costs that continue to rise, or an education system that leaves too many of our young people unprepared for the future.This is a time for solutions to get our economy moving again, and we’re eager to get to work.Your priorities will be our priorities.

By the end of this term in 2016, or any academic semester, so many other things have come to pass that midterms pale in significance.Having said that, Tuesday's midterms were a stunning slap to Barack Obama, his agenda and the defensive inertia of about-to-be-ex-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. Second-term midterms are historically tough for the White House party. But it's hard to imagine a worse night for Obama.If the 2010 midterms were a ""shellacking"" in the president's own word, then Tuesday's results were an entire sanding and refinishing job. Nine more Republicans join Speaker John Boehner's near historic GOP majority. Seven, maybe nine, new Republican senators, twice the average gain in recent such midterms.And, most unexpectedly, a whole slew of new or reelected Republican governors who will provide the 2016 GOP presidential nominee. Including three successful and popular conservative women governors -- New Mexico's Susanna Martinez, Oklahoma's Mary Fallin and South Carolina's Nikki Haley. Some GOP war on women.Also including -- wait for it -- new GOP governors in not-so-true-blue Massachusetts, Maryland and Obama's home turf of Illinois. That either makes all three states very racist. Or even blue state voters dislike Obama's policies. He personally campaigned for the three Democrat candidates.

He will acknowledge the defeats briefly, likely blame them on the advantageous geographic playing field for the GOP and say the right things about working together. But he won't.

559,XL,"The 2010 Republican wave election was about Obama's ideas, which Americans didn't like. And he purposely delayed implementation of those ideas until after the 2012 voting. This wave was about Americans' unhappiness with the results of his ideas -- losing their doctors and insurance under ObamaCare, paying more for less, not seeing real results from an improving economy, Obama's scandals, ineptness and lazy leadership abroad.Yes, the unemployment rate is down, but not because the economy is up. Because 10 million people have left the workforce. The rich are richer and the middle and lower classes are poorer, despite Obama's feckless complaints. Photo-ops have gotten Obama about as far as he can go.Will Obama take the lesson of Bill Clinton when he lost both houses in the 1994 midterms? Clinton realized that actual accomplishments, not just clever maneuverings, can be good politics. So, he worked with Republican leaderships (Remember the Contract with America?) as a doer to produce a handy reelection. A prosperous economy. And a lasting favorable legacy.We bet that's beyond Obama's vision or abilities.The Great Uniter thrives on division; that's how Chicago mayors control all 50 wards. Obama gets presiding. That's easy. But he has no clue about actual governing. He won't present his own positive agenda.In fact, we bet Obama will force a constitutional crisis over unilateral executive immigration reforms. See if he can lure Congressional Republicans into a bitter fight on his home field and herd Latinos into the Democrat camp for a generation.Hopefully, McConnell and Boehner will simply start defunding those efforts. And simultaneously proceed with presenting their own governing agenda. It's no longer sufficient to be an Obama opponent. Show us what the GOP would do, so the nation will have a real choice in 2016.Start with things some congressional Dems might go for, say, approving the Keystone XL pipeline. How about some trade reforms, which Obama has favored? Call his bluff.Tax reforms to encourage U.S. corporations to repatriate those $2 trillion in profits stashed abroad. Chip away at the most onerous ObamaCare problems; revoke the medical device tax inhibiting innovation. Forbid forced loss of family doctors.Americans will see a real alternative. Sure, Obama may veto many of these efforts.

561,XL,"Thanks mainly to the shale revolution, oil production in the U.S. hit a 28-year high last month while imports were at their lowest levels since 1995. Consequently, prices have fallen 15% since June, and Saudi Arabia has cut production by 400,000 barrels a day — providing further evidence that OPEC no longer has the power to set prices.Against these developments, the current ban on exporting American oil is nonsensical.Even the liberal Brookings Institution in a recent study concludes that it's time to remove the ban, arguing that the more we export the greater the expected decline in gasoline prices, perhaps as much as 12 cents per gallon. ""As counter-intuitive as it may seem, lifting the ban actually lowers gasoline prices by increasing the total amount of crude supply.""In addition the study identifies a number of other economic benefits from exporting oil, including higher GDP and lower unemployment.Some politicians and pundits claim that exporting oil will divert us from the path toward ""energy independence."" Others argue that exporting oil will weaken our energy security since we're still a net importer. Still others claim that keeping domestic oil at home will help lower gasoline and diesel prices.All of these arguments are baseless. Currently, we lead the world in the output of natural gas, nuclear power and renewables. We're still No. 3 in oil production, but the International Energy Agency projects that within a few years America will reclaim the No. 1 ranking. In short, we're already energy independent.As for energy security, it's hard to envision a political scenario that would result in our inability to import oil.Over the past two years we've seen political unrest in Iraq, Libya, Bahrain, Syria and other petroleum exporting countries, but oil prices have actually fallen. Most of the oil we import today comes from friendly nations like Canada and Mexico. OPEC now accounts for less than 10 percent of U.S. consumption, with half coming from Saudi Arabia to supply its huge refinery in Port Arthur.What's more, we still have the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in the unlikely event of a political conflict that could disrupt global oil movements.And because the price of oil is determined (more or less) by global supply and demand, keeping U.S. oil in the U.S. will not confer any benefits to consumers. On the other hand, exporting some of our oil can help sustain the energy boom that has created hundreds of thousands of jobs in recent years against the backdrop of a less-than-robust economic recovery from the Great Recession.Obviously, changing the laws that banned the export of crude oil in the aftermath of the mid-1970s energy crisis will not be easy, for two reasons.First, politicians, the media and the public must recognize that oil is simply a commodity. Just as we export rice and wheat at the same time we import rice and wheat, there's no reason we shouldn't do the same with oil.Second, most mainstream environmental groups oppose oil exports for the same reason they oppose natural gas exports, offshore drilling and the Keystone XL pipeline. To them, any of these developments will bring about more fossil fuel production and more fossil fuel consumption. That's bad for the planet, end of story. But they exist outside of reality.If it makes economic and logistical sense to export some grades of oil, such as light sweet crude where we have a supply glut from the Eagle Ford shale in Texas, we should do so. And if it makes economic and logistical sense to import oil, such as diluted bitumen from the Alberta Oil Sands to feed into Gulf Coast refineries that are designed to process heavy crude, we should do so as well.America is an energy-rich country, the richest in the world. We need to stop acting as though we're energy poor. Weinstein is associate director of the Maguire Energy Institute and an adjunct professor of business economics in the Cox School of Business at Southern Methodist University.

593,XL,"Inflation: We've chastised President Obama many times for failing to live up to promises he made when running for the office. So in fairness, we want to credit him for fulfilling one of them: his pledge to raise energy costs.In early 2008, candidate Obama told the San Francisco Chronicle that ""under my plan ... electricity rates would necessarily skyrocket.""Obama was referring to his plan to cap greenhouse-gas emissions, which would, among other things, effectively choke off coal as an energy source. He was just as fond of high gasoline prices, telling CNBC in June 2008 — as gas prices shot up to $4 a gallon — that he ""would have preferred a gradual adjustment.""Six years later, and Obama has succeeded.According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the energy price index has been higher than the overall Consumer Price Index since December 2010 — 46 straight months and counting.To say this is a historical anomaly is putting it mildly. Almost without exception, energy prices climbed more slowly than the overall CPI since 1957, the first year in the BLS' monthly energy price data.Even in the wake of the ""energy crisis,"" the energy index barely topped the CPI. And while the 2008 gasoline price spike pushed energy costs up, it lasted for only a short time. When Obama took office, the energy price index was 15% below the overall CPI.Since then, gasoline prices have been stuck above $3 a gallon while electricity prices climb. In the first half of this year, they jumped 3.2% — the highest on record since 2009.Why the big reversal? Despite Obama's alleged ""all of the above"" energy policy, he's declared virtual war on conventional energy sources.Oil production on federal lands has dropped 6%, according to a Congressional Research Service report. Obama continues to block the Keystone XL Pipeline, and he's planning new smog rules that will dramatically raise the cost of energy production.The EPA's greenhouse-gas rules could be the death knell for coal — which generates almost 40% of the nation's electricity.So congratulations, Mr. President. You've made it that much harder for the economy to grow and for families to make ends meet.
"
594,XL,"Energy: Canada is tired of waiting on the administration to make a decision on the Keystone XL pipeline; so tired that Ottawa has gone ahead and approved a pipeline to Canada's west coast. The White House fails again.Six months ago, Canadian Foreign Minister John Baird said ""the time for Keystone is now."" His country needed an answer on the pipeline from President Obama ""even if it's not the right one,"" he told a U.S. Chamber of Commerce audience. Canada just couldn't ""continue in this state of limbo.""Half a year after Baird almost pleaded for Obama to make a decision on Keystone, the president still has not. But Al Gore, who called the pipeline proposal ""absurdly reckless"" in a recent article he wrote for Rolling Stone, says that Obama has signaled he will reject it.Gore didn't say what the signal is. But given the multiple delays Obama has hidden behind while ""trying"" to make a decision, Gore is probably right.Actually, it would be quite a surprise if Obama, whose own State Department has said the pipeline is not an environmental menace, did approve Keystone XL. The White House and the offices of almost all elected Democrats are owned by radical environmentalists.Democrats dare not make a policy decision that will upset the green lobby or Tom Steyer, the hedge-fund billionaire who has put his substantial fortune behind alternative energy, probably seeing how crony capitalism works and deciding to get in on the action.Rejecting Keystone XL will be a mistake, however. The pipeline that would carry crude from Alberta's rich reserves to the U.S. Gulf Coast for refining and distribution would be an important piece of the North American energy domain.If it is not built, Canada will ship the crude to Asia from a super-tanker port on its Pacific coast, where it will arrive from Alberta's oil fields through the Enbridge Northern Gateway pipeline approved Tuesday.At its peak, the 1,179-mile Keystone XL pipeline could carry 830,000 barrels of oil into the U.S. each day. How does the administration plan to make up that loss if the crude flows to Asia instead?It seems Obama believes that all America needs to do to keep pace with its energy needs is for the government to fund more green energy projects. But that's a fantasy.Need anyone remind the president of the failures of Solyndra, A123 Systems, Beacon Power, First Solar and the dozens of other government-backed green energy companies that have bombed under his presidency?Without Keystone, the U.S. would most likely have to continue relying on energy from global hotspots and unreliable sources for much of its stock. A completed Keystone XL could cut by 40% our reliance on Venezuela and the Middle East — a region where Obama's foreign policy has been a disaster.His domestic policy is no better. Flowing away to Asia with the Canadian oil will also be American jobs.The assembly of Keystone XL would create 20,000 new U.S. jobs: 13,000 in construction and another 7,000 in manufacturing parts. All told, according to the State Department, the project would create 42,000 new U.S. jobs, nearly half directly related to its construction, the rest from the economic stimulus it will create.Can the administration really afford to stand in the way of putting that many to work in the private sector when less than 60% of adult Americans have a job and the labor-force participation rate is at its lowest since Jimmy Carter's second year in office?Maybe Obama thinks he's playing smart politics. As a practical matter, though, he's being unwise. But that's been the hallmark of his presidency. There's no reason to think he's going to improve his failure rate now.

They've said no to raising the minimum wage. They've said no to fair pay.""Some of them have denied that there's even a problem, despite the fact that women are getting paid 77 cents for every dollar a man is getting paid.""Those big bad Republicans, who control one-half of one of three branches of government, ""don't do anything except block me and call me names,"" he whined.Since only 5% of American workers earn the minimum wage, does anyone believe this is the magic bullet to solve our slow-growth rut?The problem with declining wages the past decade, as we have explained on these pages, is a problem for both genders, not just women.And speaking of not bringing issues to a vote, how about Harry Reid in the Senate blocking the Keystone XL Pipeline, medical device tax repeal and a change in the 30-hour-a-week rule under ObamaCare, to name a few job bills the upper house has buried?This is becoming a predictable pattern of economic excuse-making every time we get rocked by bad news.At first, the White House blamed the underperforming economy on the Polar Vortex, the severe cold weather in the East and Midwest in January and February. Then, when the gross national product numbers were revised downward, no one believed a cold winter could cause a 3% economic contraction. A survey of other really cold winters in the past reveals the economy still managed to grow.Last year, Obama suggested the economy was weak because of budget cuts forced on him by House Speaker John Boehner and the Republicans.  White House economists likened fiscal ""austerity"" to the medieval practice of ""bleeding the patient"" to cure him.Never mind that the deficit that year was still well over $500 billion — hardly austerity.When the economy got tripped up in 2012, the president blamed the disappointment on ""economic headwinds."" He actually used that phrase more than a dozen times.What were those headwinds?  One was ATM machines, which were blamed for poor job growth.""There are some structural issues with our economy,"" Obama explained, ""where a lot of businesses have learned to become much more efficient, with a lot fewer workers. You see it when you go to the bank and use an ATM — you don't go to a bank teller. Or you go to the airport, and you're using a kiosk, instead of checking in at the gate."" Maybe the Luddites in the White House will propose banning farm equipment as a way to put everyone to work.Then, of course, there was Superstorm Sandy that forced the economy into a tailspin.To believe the rhetoric, one must believe that Mother Nature is just out to get this president. In 2011, he blamed the slow growth on the earthquake and the resulting tsunami that hit Japan.Before that, it was the Arab Spring and high gas prices that reduced GDP. Before that, it was the economic calamity in Greece and other European nations that accounted for our economic ""bumpy ride."" Before that, it was a downturn in the housing market that was more severe than originally thought.""I wish I knew, and I wish everybody knew, just how deep the crisis was when I was first sworn into office,"" Obama said in 2011. ""I think we understood that it was bad, but we didn't know how bad it was.""This is the standard White House fallback: Blame it on George W. Bush.Maybe the root of the problem is Obama's policies themselves: the passage and launch of ObamaCare, the bailouts, the tax increases, the business-bashing, the EPA regulations, the cash-for-clunkers debacle, the $6 trillion of new debt, the $830 billion economic stimulus plan and so on.Either the policies are the real problem, or Obama is the unluckiest president in history. We've had earthquakes and hurricanes and Mideast turmoil and high gas prices and labor-saving devices and blizzards and other such calamities before. But it's only under this president and his policies that we've had so flimsy a recovery.Meanwhile, we're still waiting for that ""Summer of Recovery"" Vice President Joe Biden promised back in 2009. By now we were supposed to by now have 5.5 million more jobs and an unemployment rate of 5%. We're not even close.The 11% GDP growth over the last five years has been about half a normal expansion. Incomes for the middle class have not risen above the level when Obama took office, and the labor force participation rate is lower than it's been in 35 years.The Middle East again has turmoil, gasoline prices are back on the rise and who knows what the hurricane season will look like later this summer. We're running out of time for a real and sustained economic recovery, and there is even chatter about a double-dip recession.What Obama never seems to run out of are new ""headwinds"" to blame for his lousy performance.

"
644,XL,"By now, everyone's become annoyingly familiar with the eagerness of Barack and Michelle Obama and their administrative minions across the country to tell Americans how to live their lives, according to Democrat dicta of what is healthy, desirable, proper and politically correct.They've only got 938 days left to cram more rules, regulations and requirements down the national throat. Don't forget, the Chicagoan has a phone and a pen to circumvent Congress and now House Speaker John Boehner says he'll sue the administration over its self-granted powers.So, there seems to have been a flood of new attempts to control more of American life. Using the Patent Office, for example, the black president's White House is trying to change the Redskins' team name.Mrs. Obama, a known french-fry addict who serves nine pies at Thanksgiving. has never been accused of anorexia. But she's pushing restaurant chains across the country to modify the contents and portions of their menus' most popular items to make them healthy and less tasty.Mrs. Obama has, unsolicited, instructed American parents what they should and should not be serving up for their family's consumption at the breakfast and dinner table.And using the financial clout of federal subsidies, she's also driving school cafeterias to alter menus to follow her approved healthy guidelines, even if tons of that stuff then gets tossed uneaten into landfills because tomorrow's leaders disagree with the tastes of today's first lady.Using regulations and permits, Obama has stunted energy explorations on federal land and stalled the Keystone XL pipeline because to him oil is a four-letter word. Remember too ObamaCare with its 15-foot tall stack of new rules and regulations.The Environmental Protection Agency, which intends to strangle the coal industry with unattainable rules on CO2 emissions, among other things, has its eyes set on regulating pretty much any collection of water down to private puddles.But now it turns out Empress Gina McCarthy and her unfettered EPA regulation empire have encountered an environmental problem of their very own. And it stinks. Really.Someone or someones has taken to defecating in EPA office hallways.Yes, it's gross. But also hilariously karmic for environmental enforcers.If this happened in a private business, government regulators would descend in funny rubber suits, ribbon off the contaminated ares and remove the unauthorized waste disposal for further analysis.Then, they'd stand in a row behind their boss giving a full sit-rep for the TV cameras that answered the agency's news-release summons. Your tax dollars at work. While not making it all the way to the EPA's restrooms might be a relief of sorts, it could also be considered a health threat. Ask New York City subway riders.On Wednesday, McCarthy informed the House Oversight Committee that, doggone it, a whole bunch of emails sought by Congress have just up and disappeared. Quite a coincidence given the strange timing of a half-dozen crashed and trashed hard-drives over at the Internal Revenue Service containing subpoenaed evidence.Fortunately, at least one EPA email survived and Government Executive's Eric Katz found it. In the message to Denver employees, EPA Deputy Regional Administrator Howard Cantor described several damaging incidents of inappropriate bathroom behavior, including toilet sabotage and disturbing deposits of human fecal material in adjacent hallways.He said such material presented health hazards to fellow employees. Managers consulted with a workplace violence expert who warned that such anti-social behavior was not only unhealthy and unsafe but likely to escalate to something.“Management is taking this situation very seriously,"" Cantor wrote, ""and will take whatever actions are necessary to identify and prosecute these individuals."" He asked EPA workers with any information on suspected hallway poopers to alert their supervisor.An Environmental Impact Statement on the incidents is expected within a couple of years.*RELATED:Bill and Hillary go to the grocery just like usAmericans' confidence in Obama has cratered

648,XL,"Rep. Fred Upton gives the Republican Party's Weekly RemarksSo, let’s talk about energy — how it affects our daily lives, and how Republicans are working to make it more affordable, reliable, and beneficial.Not too long ago, we thought America’s energy needs could only be met through increasing foreign dependence. It’s a scary thought, particularly as we watch the chaos unfold overseas and gasoline prices closing in on four bucks a gallon here at home. I hear constantly from working families struggling with the cost of filling the tank just to drive to and from work.Energy is at the core of American life. It supports jobs and our economy, and it affects everything from the price at the pump and the monthly electric bill to the cost of groceries — all of the things that Americans need to make ends meet. Schools, churches, hospitals, and manufacturing plants in my home state of Michigan and around the country … they all depend on affordable energy.That’s why, this coming week, the House is going to vote on bills designed to make the most of America’s abundant energy supplies by building pipelines and transmission lines to connect our energy abundance to consumers, and by using our energy strength to fight back against hostile nations who use their resources to hold the rest of the world hostage.We have already taken steps to modernize permitting, approve major energy projects, cut red tape for hydro-power plants, and keep American coal in our energy mix.But we're not going to stop there. We are offering more predictable regulations that encourage investment, lower prices, and create jobs here at home. We're making targeted energy efficiency reforms, which will also help reduce costs and eliminate waste. And we're focusing on the safety and reliability of the electrical grid to protect against everything from security threats to brownouts and blackouts. We're working to keep nuclear power safe and sustainable for the long-term.That's what we mean by an “all-of-the-above” energy strategy. Fossil and renewable fuels, expanded production and conservation … together, these steps could help save money for American families, create the new jobs and industries that we want, and strengthen our position across the globe.It’s very different than President Obama’s vision. His recently announced EPA rules for power plants is going to make it harder to use all of our American resources, and could well force states to ration energy, which certainly is going to make it more expensive to power our homes and factories.His record of energy development on federal lands remains dismal. And we all may rue the day that his president decided he could not say yes to the job-creating Keystone XL pipeline, which is going to displace energy from hostile parts of the world like Venezuela and the Middle East and replace it with supplies from our ally, our friend, Canada; instead, the project is in regulatory purgatory, and America waits and waits.We can do better, yes, we can. The U.S. has entered an era of energy abundance, and now we need the architecture — the infrastructure and policies — to support it. That’s exactly what Republicans are working to deliver. Thanks for listening, have a great weekend. ####Previous weekly remarks are available by clicking here.RELATED:Americans' confidence in Obama cratersObama's decided Iraq's Maliki must go, but be very wary of historyAmerica's newest hero: A Marine who dived on a grenade to save a buddyHe's got presidential perqs down, now it's time Obama masters the work part

Why? Because rather than being a partner in prosperity, the federal government has become an obstacle to progress.Federal agencies won’t allow Alaskans to build crucial roads and bridges. The EPA and Washington, DC try to dictate how we manage our state-owned lands. The Interior Department locks up huge swaths of oil and gas resources, stifling our economic potential and costing us high-paying jobs.This problem isn’t specific to Alaska. It’s actually nationwide, and it’s being quarterbacked by President Barack Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid.The Obama-Reid agenda has locked up America’s natural resources, burdened small businesses throughout the country with an avalanche of regulations and suffocated job growth through a complete disrespect for the rule of law.What our friends on the other side of the aisle don’t understand is that none of this is helpful.

652,XL,"Energy: President Obama continues to drag out a decision on the Keystone XL pipeline. Meanwhile, the Canadians have been standing by while the administration dithers. Now they're tired of waiting.'The time for Keystone is now,"" Canada's Foreign Minister John Baird said Thursday while speaking to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Canada has reached the point where the uncertainty has become intolerable. Baird said Canada needs an answer right away, ""even if it's not the right one,"" because his country ""can't continue in this state of limbo.""If approved, the Keystone XL pipeline will transport crude from Alberta's oil sands to Gulf Coast refineries. It will merely be another pipeline in a web of many across the U.S. What, we wonder, is just one more?But crude is not all Keystone will move. The pipeline will also put people to work.The State Department, which is playing a major role in the Keystone decision, has found that ""including direct, indirect and induced effects, the proposed project would potentially support approximately 42,100 average annual jobs across the United States over a one- to two-year construction period.""Over the long term — 15 years — Keystone will create 117,000 new U.S. jobs, says the Canadian Energy Research Institute.Obama, however, has said the pipeline would create only ""about 50 permanent jobs."" So the president, it appears, is at odds over employment estimates with his own State Department, which is to determine if ""the proposed pipeline would serve the national interest.""Is it a signal that he's going to reject the State Department's recommendation if it determines Keystone is indeed in the national interest?What is clear is that the Obama White House, which has rejected the pipeline once, is afraid to make a decision.In late 2011, the administration put off any announcement until late 2013 — which has already come and gone. Now it looks like a decision won't be made until just after the November elections, if then, as Obama ordered the Energy Department on Jan. 9 to review the infrastructure for ""transporting, transmitting, and delivering energy.""One energy analyst quoted by Bloomberg News said the Quadrennial Energy Review, which won't have to issue its recommendations until Jan. 31, 2015, is the ""perfect cover"" for further delay.As a consequence of these delays, what should have been an objective decision has instead become a political calculation that puts a worthwhile project at risk.But don't worry about those anxious Canadians. They'll find someone to buy their oil if Obama blocks Keystone. China, for instance, would be glad to have it, and the OPEC countries that provide almost half of our oil imports will be content to keep sending us large volumes of their expensive crude.That's not an outcome anyone in this country should like. But it appears to be the one Obama is determined we'll get.

671,XL,"Energy: As a big Dem donor talks of pipeline terrorism, new federal reports warn that killing Keystone XL will overburden rail transport of oil and result in more frequent and deadlier environmental disasters.Environmentalists who claim that the Keystone pipeline from Canada represents an unprecedented environmental threat ignore that the pipeline would pose no greater danger than the more than 50,000 existing miles of safely operating pipeline already crisscrossing the U.S.They also ignore the very real and growing environmental danger in the only viable alternate for transporting oil — by rail. Keystone would not only carry oil from Canada to U.S. refineries but also have a link to the Bakken formation oilfields of North Dakota. As the North Dakota boom expands, so does the amount of tank cars full of Bakken crude riding the nation's rails.The Energy Information Administration has just released a report that documents how the lack of pipeline capacity is forcing increasing shipments by rail.""The number of rail carloads of crude oil began rising in 2012, as production in the Bakken shale and other shale plays grew,"" the report found. ""According to the North Dakota Pipeline Authority, Bakken rail outflow capacity totaled 965,000 barrels per day (bbl/d) at the end of 2013, compared to 515,000 bbl/d of pipeline capacity.""About a dozen crude-oil unit trains depart daily from the oil region in western North Dakota. Due to the lack of pipelines, some 69% of the state's oil is currently shipped to market by rail. The state's top oil regulator has said that as much as 90% of North Dakota oil is to be carried by train this year.Many rail shipments from the Bakken fields are being handled by BNSF Railway, which has more than 1,000 miles of tracks in the region. President Obama's favorite one-percenter, Warren Buffett, made a good investment when he bought BNSF in 2010 for $26.5 billion.With increased reliance on rail for oil shipments comes increased danger to the public. It was no surprise when the State Department, in an update to a prior report, raised the stakes for continued reliance on rail transport by oil considerably.In Friday's update, the department said that crude-oil transportation by rail could cause accidents resulting in 2,947 injuries and 434 deaths over a decade. That number is up from the earlier estimate of 700 injuries and 92 deaths.Casselton, N.D. (pop. 2,400), recently had a near brush with tragedy after a train of tank cars carrying crude oil derailed just outside the town, resulting in fiery explosions and spilling 400,000 gallons of oil into the surrounding area. Had it derailed in the city center, it would have been a major catastrophe.The North Dakota accident was the fourth major North American derailment in six months by trains transporting crude. The danger of rail shipments from Bakken is heightened by the fact that Bakken crude is more flammable than other crude, according to the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration.Interestingly, billionaire Tom Steyer, a climate-change activist, Keystone opponent and major Democratic donor, has hired retired Navy SEAL chief David Cooper to assess how vulnerable Keystone might be to sabotage by terrorists. Yet they have 50,000 existing miles of pipeline already to target as well as the vulnerable rail shipments.Oil pipelines such as Keystone transport oil much more safely than trains and ships, notes James Taylor, a senior fellow for environmental policy at the Competitive Enterprise Institute. Not building Keystone is an invitation to disaster.

673,XL,"The U.S. economy contracted during the first quarter of 2014. Policymakers in Washington need to get past the idea that this is simply a cyclical problem that a monetary policy of low interest rates can solve. They must realize that it is an economic growth problem that requires a different approach.Excessive regulation is choking the recovery. To spur faster economic growth, regulatory policies must change.Despite the actions of the Federal Reserve and the fiscal stimulus, the U.S. economy has grown at an average annual rate of 2.5% since the end of the Great Recession in mid-2009. The rate compares to an average rate of 4% over comparable periods after the three previous recessions.Labor markets have not recovered as promised by the administration. The unemployment rate remains stubbornly high at 6.3%. If we include part-time workers who would prefer to work full time, the rate jumps to 12.3%.More than one-third of these unemployed or underemployed workers have been without work for more than 27 weeks. Teenage unemployment is near 20%. The longer these individuals are out of work, the harder it will be for them to secure employment. They are permanently hurt by this prolonged period of stagnant economic growth.One remedy is to roll back regulatory intrusions that have prevented a normal recovery. The most visible culprits are requirements that firms provide workers with mandated health-insurance coverage, state laws that raise the price of energy, and policies that have kept banks from their traditional role of facilitating investment and, therefore, job growth.The federal policies of extending unemployment compensation and liberalizing disability eligibility rules may have helped initially, but they've also reduced the incentive to search for work after the economy bottoms out. In addition, the new health care law places significant burdens on small firms, discouraging hiring.Increased bank regulation has reduced the traditional role of the banking sector in identifying and funding investment and job creation in a recovery. The Dodd-Frank Act has significantly added to the cost of doing business.It hasn't helped that, since the passage of Dodd-Frank in 2010, only about half the rules needed to implement the law have been finalized, resulting in a high level of policy uncertainty discouraging lending. Financial-institution compliance has been costly, especially for smaller institutions.Regulatory uncertainty makes firms less willing to invest. For example, the administration has postponed its decision on the Keystone XL pipeline until after the November elections. Long delays of this sort do more than prevent job creation associated with construction of the pipeline. Given the uncertainty surrounding this project, other potentially important projects are likely to be postponed or canceled.At the state level, clean-energy policies have acted as brakes on economic activity, discouraging job creation by raising energy prices and generating uncertainty about future energy prices.President Obama's solutions — heavy federal stimulus spending and interventions in the labor market to raise the minimum wage and the wages of women — cannot reinvigorate the economy. These policies may score some political points with some voters, but they are the antithesis of what is needed to speed up growth and lower unemployment.Has not one adviser pointed out that an increase in the minimum wage would reduce access to employment for low-skilled workers or that mandating wage equality where it is not justified by market conditions will discourage firms from employing women?The U.S. is not in cyclical recovery but in a period of slow growth weakened by growing regulatory constraints and costs. Research shows that expanding the size and scope of government is a cause of slow economic growth, because its rules act as a tax on business.Serious regulatory reform and a reduction in regulatory uncertainty would help return the economy to a healthy growth rate and put people back to work. Regulations need to be clear and certain, minimizing the costs to businesses. These costs have been growing for some time and have accelerated under the Obama administration.Only the private sector can create jobs. It's time to let the private sector do what it does best by freeing businesses from regulatory overkill and mandated benefits that get in the way of job creation. Krol is a retired professor of economics at California State University, Northridge.

"
681,XL,"warnings of fundamental tech troubles within his namesake legislation.And
"

"
683,XL,"treatment for vets from the media, which had chronicled his original
"
684,XL,"outrage over unconscionable delays fully six years ago. Delays he
"
685,XL,"vowed then to fix should he become king president.But,
"
686,XL,"according to Obama, he was not stunned or surprised at all, not even
"
687,XL,"mildly shocked by the nationwide, bipartisan outrage over his illegal
"
688,XL,"swapping of the Taliban's Terrorism Board of Directors for an American
"
689,XL,"who not only volunteered for the U.S. Army, but then volunteered to walk
"
690,XL,"over to the enemy busy killing his comrades.And to see that man and his eccentric parents hailed in a special Saturday Rose Garden photo-op celebrating his release with an heroic tone. True, this prisoner-bargain controversy buried the VA scandal for the moment. But it's also hijacked coverage of the president's week-long attempted reset of security policy in Europe.""I'm never surprised by controversies that are whipped up in Washington,"" the president claimed in a Thursday news conference.What planet has he been on? Does Obama ever talk with his staff, who didn't tell him about the IRS, ObamaCare and the VA? They've been quoted all week saying (anonymously) they were caught flat-footed by the political wildfire ignited by the deal to release five of the world's worst bad guys in or out of prison. ""Blind-sided,"" was their preferred word.""Sire,"" a minister once told the French monarch. ""The peasants are revolting.""""I know,"" said that country's last king, ""They never bathe.""Then, conveniently misunderstanding the target of widespread criticism, Obama added: “I make absolutely no apologies for making sure we get back a young man to his parents."" What a thoughtful politician! Always thinking of others.OK. Well, how about making sure that five top-ranking terrorists -- two of them wanted elsewhere for crimes against humanity -- don't get back with their IED-making, girls-school machine-gunning colleagues? No regrets there either, the Democrat professes, because he'll be ""keeping eyes on them.""This from the man whose administration can't lay eyes on the Benghazi murderers 633 days after the president vowed swift justice for them and months after raid leaders were interviewed by U.S. media outlets.According to Obama and his apologists, speed was suddenly of the essence in this bargain because the American might be in poor health and -- who knows? -- the Taliban might kill him.Which -- let's be honest for a change, sir -- they could have done during any one of the 2,592,000 minutes they held him. But they didn't -- did they? -- because they knew he was worth more alive.So, big Obama hurry after five years of nothing. Come to think of it, that's about the same time-frame Obama's held the Keystone XL pipeline as prisoner.The U.S. commander-in-chief acts like he had no leverage on these Taliban guys, who kept returning to the table for years. What might that suggest to even the dimmest of used-car salesmen?
"
691,XL,"Vladimir Putin, Bashir al-Assad, Nouri al-Maliki, Kim Jong-Un, Hamid Karzai and Iran's mullahs have been playing Obama like this for years.The alleged need for speed is also Obama's excuse for violating the law he signed last December requiring 30 days' notice to Congress before moving any Guantanamo prisoner. Susan Rice's credibility is even lower than Obama's job approval. But she says the prisoner deal was essentially done May 27 and finalized the next day.So, that's only three days to get a call through the 16 blocks to Capitol Hill.“The White House,"" Democrat Sen. Dianne Feinstein observed with a collegial shrug, ""is pretty unilateral about what they want to do when they want to do it.""Obama claims that years ago his people told Congress he might do a prisoner deal. But then, years ago he also promised the Recovery Summer of 2010. Obama is so smart he doesn't want to waste time talking with mere Americans, as opposed to at us. So, we're left to mine news conference blather to detect his thinking.Of course, Obama won't be the one to feel the blast of his mistakes. But in Warsaw, the president made a stunning public admission about the released Taliban for someone in charge of United States national security:“Is there a possibility of some of them trying to return to activities that are detrimental to us?"" Obama asked himself out loud. ""Absolutely!""Obama said the possibility of freed terrorists returning to battle has been true of all the prisoners he's released from Guantanamo. And many have.You've almost got to admire someone with the nerve to cite his own failures as evidence he has the courage to repeat them.Almost.

"
695,XL,"Obama and those who control the Senate have been doing a lot of polling
"
696,XL,"and focus groups and have come up with a proposal to take money from
"
697,XL,"those they define as rich and give it to a few college graduates within a
"
698,XL,"group who have student loan debt. (Scroll down for video of these remarks.)The left is masterful at buying votes with other people’s money, but knocking a few dollars off the average monthly college loan payment does not make up for the policies they have enacted that make it harder for businesses to create jobs and Americans to make a living.There are better ways to help graduates and other Americans who want a better life. We need to rapidly expand the job market.Republicans know Americans deserve better from Washington. Republicans have proposals to help employers create more jobs and help students access a good education. We know when you give Americans new opportunities, they achieve far more than anyone could imagine.From what I’ve seen of the early versions of the Democratic student loan plan, it would not make college more affordable, it would not reduce the amount of money students will have to borrow, or do anything about the lack of jobs grads face in the Obama economy. The proposal would increase the federal debt (it’s already $17 trillion) it would increase it by $400 billion more. The only way to claim it wouldn’t is to use more phony accounting.The proposal would also set a dangerous precedent by making private debt into public debt, not to mention that it would enact a job-destroying tax that the Senate’s already rejected.Republicans have introduced bills designed to enable more high school students to attend a college of their choice while creating jobs, while eliminating regulations that don’t make a difference and forms required just for the sake of curiosity.The more involved the federal government becomes in something, the more it seems to cost. Health care is an example.In the early days of selling his health care plan, the President said it was going to bring health care prices down. I warned then that we would see massive increases in not only what patients pay, but also what the federal government has to pay.Now many people’s premiums are up and continuing to climb. The IRS prepares to collect heavy health care taxes. This may be the most expensive free lunch in our nation’s history.There are better ways to ensure more people have improved, affordable health care. GOP senators have introduced measures that would repair the damage. We would protect take-home pay by restoring the 40-hour work week. We would encourage businesses to hire more people without penalty.I want to repeal the ‘Unaffordable’ Health Care Act and replace it with common-sense, patient-centered reforms that let you keep your doctor, that let you choose your hospital, that reduces health care costs and increases access to affordable, high-quality care that you and your doctor agree on.We’ve introduced plans that would do that. The Administration and Senate majority favor costly government-centered mandates and regulations. They’re building a system that, as one health insurance executive puts it, would ‘break people away from the choice habit’ and ‘fixation on open access.’America was built on citizens having the freedom to make choices that best fit them as individuals. That’s what Republican education, Republican health care, and other proposals do.Energy is another key area where we need policy changes.The Administration has set out to kill coal and its 800,000 jobs. If it succeeds in death by regulation, we’ll all be paying a lot more money for electricity — if we can get it. Our pocketbook will be lighter, but our country will be darker. The Administration also slow walks approval of domestic oil and gas production. It’s death by delay for the Keystone XL Pipeline. We all want clean air and clean water. We don’t want costly regulations that make little or no difference, that are making things less affordable. Republicans want electricity and gas when you need it, at a price you can afford.Students, recent graduates and all of us don’t have to let ourselves be ruled by executive orders without basis in law, for agency mandates that cost without benefit and policies where only the federal government is smart enough to make your decisions.America works best when Americans are making their own choices.Americans are inventive. Let’s free our students with policies that provide opportunity. Don’t handcuff them with ‘I’m from the government and I’m here to help.’ That kind of help will only hold them back.Quit holding Americans, particularly students, hostage to government gifts for which they will ultimately have to pay a high price. Thanks for listening and God bless America. ####Other recent party remarks can be read here.RELATED:The why and how of Shinseki's VA 'resignation'As usual, Obama feigns outrage over his latest scandalWhat's not to trust in Obama's team investigating Obama's team?

700,XL,"Rep. Steve Scalise gives the Republican Party's Weekly RemarksGood morning, I’m Steve Scalise, representative of Louisiana’s First Congressional District and incoming House Majority Whip.I’m speaking to you from the Old House Chamber, the same room where Abraham Lincoln once served as a member of Congress. And I’m just steps from where House Republicans are working to build a stronger economy and a better future. (Scroll down for video of these remarks.)This is certainly a long way from Jefferson, Louisiana -- a town on the banks of the Mississippi where my wife Jennifer and I are raising our two young children.I’d like to talk to you today about something near and dear to me, and that’s hard work. Only in America, can a boy born in a single-room cabin in rural Kentucky work hard and become the 16th President of the United States.And only in America, can the great-grandson of an Italian immigrant who came to the United States as an indentured servant, work hard and be elected by his colleagues to serve as the Majority Whip of the House of Representatives.Because of my great-grandparents’ sacrifices, I was born into a middle-class family in New Orleans. Growing up, I was taught the value of hard work. I worked at Home Depot to help pay my way through LSU, where I became the first in my family to graduate college.From an early age, I was taught that this is just what you do — work hard, play by the rules and never give up. It’s what’s made America the greatest country on Earth.That’s a lesson Democrats in Washington don’t seem to understand. They think every problem can be solved by raising taxes and borrowing money we don’t have to grow an already bloated federal government.And where has this gotten us?On the president’s watch, the number of Americans age 16 and over who are not working has jumped to a record 92 million. That’s about 10 million more Americans not working than when President Obama took the oath of office.Hard-working taxpayers know we can do better. Because when Americans work hard, there’s nothing we can’t accomplish.Here’s an example: If you look at the regions in the country with the lowest unemployment rates, many have energy-based economies. I’m proud to represent one of them -- the Houma-Thibodaux area, which boasts a 3.7 percent unemployment rate.In Southeast Louisiana, someone can graduate high-school and get an entry-level job making over $60,000 a year producing American energy.American energy brings billions into our economy, increases our nation’s energy security, and helps lower gas prices at the pump.The American people know energy is the best way to jump-start our economy.But Democrats running Washington don’t seem to get it. They block bill after bill that would expand energy production, would lower gas prices, and create jobs.As a matter of fact, there are nearly 300 House-passed bills collecting dust in the Senate today — more than 40 of them specifically focused on creating jobs.These include popular bipartisan projects like the Keystone XL pipeline — something the president’s own administration says will create 40,000 jobs.Washington Democrats have said no to legislation to rein in the size of government, no to fixing our broken tax code, and no to lower health care costs.Every time they say no — every time they pick their interests over yours — they hold our economy hostage, and with it, our chance to make sure our kids will have that same shot at the American Dream.The president likes to say he can makes things happen with a pen and a phone. Well, what will it be, Mr. President?Will you put down the pen and stop trying to rewrite laws you don’t like, and instead pick up the phone and call on Senate Democrats to get to work passing those good bipartisan jobs bills?Will you help us make real progress, or will you sit by and encourage more gridlock and more politics as usual?It’s your call.We stand ready to work with you to solve our nation’s problems.In the meantime, we’ll be here in the House continuing to work hard for the American people. Thank you for listening. ####For previous Weekly Remarks by either party, click here.

734,XL,"Certainly the residents of Casselton, N.D., would agree.Energy Policy: An oil-laden train collides with another and bursts into flames in a small American town, proving why pipelines are safer and why environmentalist opposition to a pipeline from Canada is misguided.Casselton, N.D., had a near brush with tragedy after a train of tank cars carrying crude oil derailed, resulting in fiery explosions and a call from the town's mayor for a re-examination of how such fuel is transported across the United States.The railroad runs right through the middle of Casselton, a town of 2,400 people about 25 miles west of Fargo, and Mayor Ed McConnell said dozens of people could have been killed had the derailments had occurred in the town, not just outside.It's time, he said, to ""have a conversation"" with federal lawmakers about the dangers of transporting oil by rail.""There have been numerous derailments in this area,"" he told the Associated Press. ""It's almost gotten to the point that it looks like not if we're going to have an accident, it's when. We dodged a bullet by having it out of town, but this is too close for comfort.""Thanks to a boom in oil production in the Bakken shale formation that runs underneath the state, North Dakota has become the No. 2 oil-producing state in the nation. It's creating a lot of the kind of high-paying jobs that the rest of America desperately wants — and needs.An estimated 11 to 12 crude-oil unit trains depart daily from the oil region in western North Dakota. Due to lack of pipelines, some 69% of the state's oil is currently shipped to market by rail.The state's top oil regulator has said as much as 90% of North Dakota's oil is to be carried by train in 2014.In July, a train loaded with North Dakota crude derailed and burned in the Quebec town of Lac-Megantic, 130 miles east of Montreal. The accident created an inferno of burning crude, killing 47 and incinerating the downtown area.The Canadian and North Dakota oil train derailments come amid the controversy over the transport of Canadian crude through the proposed Keystone XL pipeline to Gulf Coast refineries. Keystone XL would not only transport Canadian oil from the sands of Alberta.It would also carry oil from the Bakken in North Dakota, where jobs and the economy are booming as a result.Many of the rail shipments from the Bakken fields are being handled by BNSF Railway Co., which has more than 1,000 miles of tracks in the region.President Obama's favorite 1-percenter, Warren Buffett, made a good investment when he bought BNSF in 2010 for $26.5 billion.With the explosive development of the Bakken shale formation, its oil riches are shipped south on Buffett's railroad in dangerous tank cars instead of a proposed link to the stalled Keystone XL pipeline.Environmentalists worry about pipeline leaks, but the fact is railroads suffer spills 2.7 times more often than pipelines, according to the Association of American Railroads.""The evidence is overwhelming that railroads are far less safe than pipelines,"" says Charles Ebinger, director of the Brookings Institution's energy security initiative.Environmentalists fighting Keystone XL ignore the fact that there would be no greater danger from the pipeline than that posed by any of the more than 50,000 existing miles of safely operating pipeline already crisscrossing the U.S., including Nebraska and the Ogallala Aquifer.Certainly pipelines do not derail and burn in or near population centers.Speaking of Keystone XL's economic benefits in a sluggish economy, former President George W.

772,XL,"Only a few weeks after President Obama's controversial decision to delay the building of the Keystone XL pipeline, the Obama administration is expected in the next several weeks to approve a 500-mile green energy transmission line project running through Arizona and New Mexico that his own Defense Department says may pose ""an unacceptable risk to national security."" 
"
773,XL,"The multibillion-dollar electric power line project, financed by a group called SunZia, would connect wind power facilities in eastern New Mexico to the electric grid and supply power to Arizona and California.
"
774,XL,"About 45 miles of the transmission lines would be located in a ""restricted zone"" because it would overlap an Army missile testing ground at New Mexico's White Sands Missile Range.
"
775,XL,"'National Security Risk'
"
776,XL,"Rep. Steve Pearce, R-N.M., says the plan would compromise the military base's central mission of testing cruise missiles and ""create a serious national security risk.""  New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez has also weighed in, saying: ""I am seriously concerned that the planned route for the project"" poses ""an unacceptable national security risk.""
"
777,XL,"Pearce and Martinez have for many months advised the SunZia management to reroute the power lines in a way that won't interfere with the army base operations. But the investors have objected on the grounds that drawing up a new course for the lines would be too expensive and lead to years of environmental impact delays.
"
778,XL,"This line of defense has almost never stopped the government from killing economic development projects in the past.
"
779,XL,"SunZia has awkwardly pitted two agencies of the Obama administration against each other: the Bureau of Land Management, which is all-in on the White House's green energy crusade, and the DOD, which warns that the project could jeopardize security operations.
"
780,XL,"The power line could obstruct vital operations at White Sands, which is the Pentagon's largest testing station for long-range weapons. DOD has already vetoed the project twice, but the greens in the administration keep agitating for it.
"
781,XL,"Public Lands For Some
"
782,XL,"The Obama administration from its first days in office has issued guidelines requiring the Department of the Interior to make public lands available for ""renewable energy projects.""  It has sided with SunZia and has endorsed the planned route for the transmission that intersects with the military base as the ""preferred alternative.""
"
783,XL,"This is the same Interior Department that has raised myriad obstacles impeding the oil and gas industry's ability to obtain leasing permits for drilling projects.
"
784,XL,"In an attempt to resolve the internal Obama administration dispute, the feds last year sponsored a study by researchers at MIT Lincoln Laboratory to examine how great the disruption would be to military testing. That study's findings were issued last week, but the precise contents have been kept under wraps as ""confidential.""
"
785,XL,"Several sources have read it, and they confirm the negative impact on the missile testing — which may be why the report hasn't seen the light of day.  Rep. Pearce says that the study ""well validated"" national security concerns and confirms his concern that SunZia could ""shut down 30%"" of the White Sands missile base operations.
"
786,XL,"Why would a study of a project that its supporters say does not pose a threat to national security be classified as confidential?
"
787,XL,"Under one draft plan that the Obama administration is pushing, the project would go forward and most of the costs associated with mitigating the transmission line interference with military operations at White Sands would be paid for by DOD, not the SunZia investors.
"
788,XL,"For example, one way to negate interference from the power lines would be to bury them underground. But that is far more expensive and, under one plan the Obama administration is pushing, DOD may have to absorb about 80% of the cost, not the private investors who will profit from the project.
"
789,XL,"DOD's resources are already stretched thin from sequester cuts and spending caps that have cut almost $100 billion from its budget in recent years.
"
790,XL,"The green energy lobby has called in its heaviest of political artillery to get the project approved. In March Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid wrote a letter to Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and Interior Secretary Sally Jewell that states:
"
791,XL,"""I have been monitoring the progress of the SunZia transmission line. I understand that over $44 million has been expended on permitting over the last five years, with delays due to the Department of Defense's reversal of two approvals and unclear guidance from DOD.""
"
792,XL,"Then he warns: ""I strongly suggest that the Department of Defense work collaboratively with the Department of the Interior immediately"" to resolve the delays.
"
793,XL,"What is striking about this debate is that the position of the White House and Harry Reid is diametrically opposite to the reaction to the Keystone XL pipeline.
"
794,XL,"Harry Reid won't even allow the pipeline to come up for a vote in the U.S. Senate, but the SunZia dispute should be resolved ""immediately.""
"
795,XL,"On Keystone, the White House announced that the project should not go forward until it can be proven to be in ""the national interest.""  On SunZia, the White House wants to override critical national security risks to promote green energy.
"
796,XL,"This is a clear pattern in this White House, says Dan Kish, of the Institute for Energy Research in Washington, D.C.  ""They've titled the entire playing field toward green energy.  The double standard is truly remarkable.""
"
797,XL,"Then he adds: ""It's too bad every industry and taxpayer can't get this kind of favorable treatment from the government regulators.""
"
798,XL,"""It is irresponsible that the White House would side with corporate profits over the safety and well-being of our men and women in uniform,"" says Rep. Pearce. ""Allowing the SunZia project to interfere with our national security shows this project is driven by crony capitalism, just like Solyndra.""
"
799,XL," Moore is a member of the IBD Brain Trust and chief economist at the Heritage Foundation.Only a few weeks after President Obama's controversial decision to delay the building of the Keystone XL pipeline, the Obama administration is expected in the next several weeks to approve a 500-mile green energy transmission line project running through Arizona and New Mexico that his own Defense Department says may pose ""an unacceptable risk to national security.""

But the investors have objected on the grounds that drawing up a new course for the lines would be too expensive and lead to years of environmental impact delays.This line of defense has almost never stopped the government from killing economic development projects in the past.SunZia has awkwardly pitted two agencies of the Obama administration against each other: the Bureau of Land Management, which is all-in on the White House's green energy crusade, and the DOD, which warns that the project could jeopardize security operations.The power line could obstruct vital operations at White Sands, which is the Pentagon's largest testing station for long-range weapons. DOD has already vetoed the project twice, but the greens in the administration keep agitating for it.Public Lands For SomeThe Obama administration from its first days in office has issued guidelines requiring the Department of the Interior to make public lands available for ""renewable energy projects.""  It has sided with SunZia and has endorsed the planned route for the transmission that intersects with the military base as the ""preferred alternative.""This is the same Interior Department that has raised myriad obstacles impeding the oil and gas industry's ability to obtain leasing permits for drilling projects.In an attempt to resolve the internal Obama administration dispute, the feds last year sponsored a study by researchers at MIT Lincoln Laboratory to examine how great the disruption would be to military testing. That study's findings were issued last week, but the precise contents have been kept under wraps as ""confidential.""Several sources have read it, and they confirm the negative impact on the missile testing — which may be why the report hasn't seen the light of day.  Rep. Pearce says that the study ""well validated"" national security concerns and confirms his concern that SunZia could ""shut down 30%"" of the White Sands missile base operations.Why would a study of a project that its supporters say does not pose a threat to national security be classified as confidential?Under one draft plan that the Obama administration is pushing, the project would go forward and most of the costs associated with mitigating the transmission line interference with military operations at White Sands would be paid for by DOD, not the SunZia investors.For example, one way to negate interference from the power lines would be to bury them underground. But that is far more expensive and, under one plan the Obama administration is pushing, DOD may have to absorb about 80% of the cost, not the private investors who will profit from the project.DOD's resources are already stretched thin from sequester cuts and spending caps that have cut almost $100 billion from its budget in recent years.The green energy lobby has called in its heaviest of political artillery to get the project approved. In March Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid wrote a letter to Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and Interior Secretary Sally Jewell that states:""I have been monitoring the progress of the SunZia transmission line. I understand that over $44 million has been expended on permitting over the last five years, with delays due to the Department of Defense's reversal of two approvals and unclear guidance from DOD.""Then he warns: ""I strongly suggest that the Department of Defense work collaboratively with the Department of the Interior immediately"" to resolve the delays.What is striking about this debate is that the position of the White House and Harry Reid is diametrically opposite to the reaction to the Keystone XL pipeline.Harry Reid won't even allow the pipeline to come up for a vote in the U.S. Senate, but the SunZia dispute should be resolved ""immediately.""On Keystone, the White House announced that the project should not go forward until it can be proven to be in ""the national interest.""  On SunZia, the White House wants to override critical national security risks to promote green energy.This is a clear pattern in this White House, says Dan Kish, of the Institute for Energy Research in Washington, D.C.  ""They've titled the entire playing field toward green energy.  The double standard is truly remarkable.""Then he adds: ""It's too bad every industry and taxpayer can't get this kind of favorable treatment from the government regulators.""""It is irresponsible that the White House would side with corporate profits over the safety and well-being of our men and women in uniform,"" says Rep. Pearce. ""Allowing the SunZia project to interfere with our national security shows this project is driven by crony capitalism, just like Solyndra."" Moore is a member of the IBD Brain Trust and chief economist at the Heritage Foundation.

854,XL,"At a press conference after meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper last month, President Obama was asked about his delay in approving the Keystone XL pipeline. Can you say awkward? Harper has been pressing Obama to do the right thing and approve the pipeline that would pump oil from Alberta, Canada, to U.S. refineries on the Gulf Coast. But…
"
855,XL,"Keystone XL: Does the president always invent some new excuse for putting off approval of the pipeline? His latest delay means it's been in regulatory purgatory for four years and counting. Hey, no sense in rushing things.
"
856,XL,"Here is what President Obama said on Good Friday when he announced that he was delaying a decision until after the election:
"
857,XL,"""Allowing the Keystone pipeline to be built requires a finding that doing so would be in our nation's interest. And our national interest will be served only if this project does not significantly exacerbate the problem of carbon pollution.""
"
858,XL,"Thank God that Obama wasn't president in the 1970s, or we would have never built the Trans-Alaska Pipeline. What's next? Banning oil and gas drilling in the U.S. in order to stop the oceans from rising? They're already busy at Obama's EPA shutting down coal-burning electric-power plants.
"
859,XL,"Obama had earlier made the case that he would delay the Keystone pipeline because of concerns about the path through Nebraska that might interfere with water aquifers. Then when Keystone was rerouted to sidestep that problem, he started belittling the project as an insignificant number of jobs. He even made the laughable claim that it would lead to ""only 50 permanent jobs.""
"
860,XL,"Actually, in the private sector, there is no such thing as a ""permanent"" job. Those exist only in government. But a $3 billion plus construction project with some 1,500 miles of pipeline running from the Canadian border to Texas is expected to create upward of 10,000 direct and indirect jobs while the project is built. And didn't this same White House spend $830 billion of taxpayer money on a stimulus plan to create millions of temporary jobs, most of which never materialized at all?
"
861,XL,"We suspect that there would be no shortage of workers lining up for the jobs that Obama is thumbing his nose at. Most of these positions — for pipe fitters, welders, truckers and the like — pay between $50,000 and $100,000 a year. The president says that the key to putting America to work is to spend $100 billion of taxpayer money on infrastructure projects, yet he ridicules an urgently needed infrastructure project that will cost taxpayers almost nothing because it is privately funded. Maybe that's the problem.
"
862,XL,"So what is the real problem here? On Monday, John Harwood, a left-leaning political commentator for CNBC, called the delay decision ""not the White House's finest hour"" (to say the least) and then was brutally honest about Obama's motivation: ""100% politics.""
"
863,XL,"The man behind this umpteenth Keystone delay is billionaire hedge-fund manager Tom Steyer, who is a radical green and has promised the Democrats $100 million this election season if they do his bidding. And so Obama is doing just that.
"
864,XL,"Imagine, though, the public uproar if Republican energy policy were so dictated by the Koch brothers.
"
865,XL,"Any honest assessment of the latest White House travesty is that Democrats are the ones addicted to the contributions of billionaires, and if that means fewer jobs and less energy security for America, so be it.Keystone XL: Does the president always invent some new excuse for putting off approval of the pipeline?

And so Obama is doing just that.Imagine, though, the public uproar if Republican energy policy were so dictated by the Koch brothers.Any honest assessment of the latest White House travesty is that Democrats are the ones addicted to the contributions of billionaires, and if that means fewer jobs and less energy security for America, so be it.

924,XL,"President Obama, whose poll approval numbers hover weakly around 40% among Americans, met Thursday with Pope Francis, whose approval numbers among the same people are 76%.Now, you know why the Chicago Democrat sought the meeting.The two elected leaders exchanged gifts. The Vicar of Christ gave the ex-state senator a copy of his book, ""Evangelii Gaudium,"" or ""The Joy of the Gospel."" The 44th president gave the head of the world's Roman Catholic Church a box of fruit and veggie seeds from his wife's garden.The first meeting of the new pope and lame-duck president was closely-watched because of the Democrat's concerted efforts to bring religious institutions to heel in his country, primarily through requirements of his botched ObamaCare legislation forcing some to violate their conscience.In fact, attorneys for the Obama administration, which has granted so many ObamaCare exemptions to unions and other politically-favored, argued in the Supreme Court this week that private companies claiming religious conscience over insurance mandates for birth control and abortion-inducing procedures should not be exempted.According to Obama's version of the Vatican meeting, their discussions focused on poverty and income inequality, two concerns which, if true, would fit well with Obama's professed political programs domestically.In fact, from Europe Thursday Obama issued a special statement celebrating Connecticut Democrats giving final approval to a new job-killing minimum wage of $10.10 in that state, now the nation's highest.On his papal discussions, Obama was vague on healthcare details. “We actually didn’t talk a whole lot about social schisms in my conversations with His Holiness,"" Obama claimed. ""In fact, that really was not a topic of conversation."" Obama stated that the pope ""did not touch in detail"" on his Affordable Care Act. Note the fudge words ""in detail.""Obama admitted that ObamaCare did arise in his meeting with the pope's secretary of state, but said he reassured Cardinal Pietro Parolin that religious conscience was not affected by his namesake legislation.It went unreported by U.S. media, but at that precise moment a bolt of lightning narrowly missed the American. Just kidding.The Vatican's version of the Obama encounter was strikingly different. The two men had a ""cordial meeting,"" a spokesman said. Importantly, their talks involved ""a discussion on questions of particular relevance for the church in that country, such as the exercise of the rights to religious freedom, life and conscientious objection.”Neither side mentioned the Obama administration's legal prosecution of the Little Sisters of the Poor for the nuns' opposition to birth control mandates. And the Vatican version said nothing about the alleged Obama-Pope Francis income inequality palaver.>Obama, who mocked his Republican opponent in 2012 for warning that Russia was a major geo-political foe, has been traveling around Europe in recent days suddenly warning about Russia.While Obama is implementing deep cuts in the U.S. military back to pre-World War II levels, the president has been telling NATO it must bolster its forces against the political and territorial ambitions of Russian President Putin.Obama now moves on for his pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia where, we're betting, he will not bow to the king again.The royal family there has unfriended Obama for his tacit concession to Iran developing nuclear weapons.But the Arab royals are quite pleased with Obama's reduction of drilling permits on U.S. federal lands and his stubborn stalling of the Keystone XL pipeline, both of which would threaten American dependence on Arab oil.In other presidential activities representing America abroad, Obama visited the ancient Roman Colosseum Thursday. Looking out on the precious, historic ruins whose construction began 1,944 years ago, the Harvard grad, profound thinker and current President of the United States observed:""This is bigger than some current baseball stadiums.""RELATED:Obama is the Mr. Softee of Western leadersWhy jobs and the economy grow better under GOP governors'The surest path to danger is always weakness and indecision'--Romney

928,XL,"As Lachlan Markay notes in the Washington Free Beacon, both freshman Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia and Democratic Rep. Alan Lowenthal of California, both vocal opponents of Keystone XL, have significant investments in companies with competing ways of bringing the crude from the oil sands of Alberta to market.
"
929,XL,"""Building this pipeline would dramatically ramp up capacity for tar sands oil that moves us in the opposite direction of an innovative, make-it-cleaner approach,"" Kaine said in a statement following the issuance of a State Department report that said not building Keystone XL would have no environmental benefit since Canada was not about to leave its crude in the ground, but would extract it anyway and send it westward through competing pipelines to energy-hungry markets such as China.
"
930,XL,"Public records from Kaine's most recent financial disclosure examined by the Free Beacon show that he has between $15,000 and $50,000 invested in Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, which owns the Trans Mountain Pipeline in Canada and takes oil sands from Alberta to Canada's west coast, where there are refineries and export terminals.
"
931,XL,"Kinder Morgan is considering expanding the Trans Mountain Pipeline, boosting its capacity to 890,000 barrels a day. Keystone XL is estimated to bring 830,000 barrels of Canadian crude from Alberta's oil sands to refineries along America's Gulf Coast.

932,XL,"Kinder Morgan is the same company and pipeline that billionaire hedge fund manager and Obama bundler Tom Steyer was invested in as he also railed against the environmental harm of Keystone. Steyer denied any financial interest in opposing Keystone, but opted after the disclosure to dump his holdings, moving on to the green pastures of global warming and climate change that made Al Gore wealthy.
"

937,XL,"Many, if not most, of the Obama administration's energy policy decisions from Solyndra forward have seemingly been based on which friend of Obama would benefit. As bad as this crony capitalism is and has been for our republic and our economy, crony congressmen are worse.Politics: While they exaggerate the pipeline's environmental dangers, Democrats who oppose the Keystone XL have invested in direct competitors to the company that would build the pipeline.We hereby issue a ""smidgen of corruption"" alert by noting what at the very least is an appearance of impropriety: Democrats who oppose the completion of the Keystone XL pipeline from Canada have invested in companies who have a financial interest in it never being built.As Lachlan Markay notes in the Washington Free Beacon, both freshman Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia and Democratic Rep. Alan Lowenthal of California, both vocal opponents of Keystone XL, have significant investments in companies with competing ways of bringing the crude from the oil sands of Alberta to market.""Building this pipeline would dramatically ramp up capacity for tar sands oil that moves us in the opposite direction of an innovative, make-it-cleaner approach,"" Kaine said in a statement following the issuance of a State Department report that said not building Keystone XL would have no environmental benefit since Canada was not about to leave its crude in the ground, but would extract it anyway and send it westward through competing pipelines to energy-hungry markets such as China.Public records from Kaine's most recent financial disclosure examined by the Free Beacon show that he has between $15,000 and $50,000 invested in Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, which owns the Trans Mountain Pipeline in Canada and takes oil sands from Alberta to Canada's west coast, where there are refineries and export terminals.Kinder Morgan is considering expanding the Trans Mountain Pipeline, boosting its capacity to 890,000 barrels a day. Keystone XL is estimated to bring 830,000 barrels of Canadian crude from Alberta's oil sands to refineries along America's Gulf Coast.Kinder Morgan is the same company and pipeline that billionaire hedge fund manager and Obama bundler Tom Steyer was invested in as he also railed against the environmental harm of Keystone. Steyer denied any financial interest in opposing Keystone, but opted after the disclosure to dump his holdings, moving on to the green pastures of global warming and climate change that made Al Gore wealthy.According to the Free Beacon, Lowenthal has between ""$15,000 and $50,000 invested in Enbridge Energy Management, $1,000 to $15,000 in Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, and $15,000 to $50,000 in Kinder Morgan Management, which is a limited partner in and handles everyday management for the company's Energy Partners subsidiary.""Lowenthal is one of 22 Democrats who signed a December letter to U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman insisting that the Keystone XL pipeline would be harmful to the environment.

938,XL,"XL Group Ltd (XL  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 2 after the market closes. In fourth-quarter 2017, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 8.16%.Let’s see, how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to be Considered This QuarterThe P&C insurer is likely to witness premium growth in the to-be-reported quarter, fueled by higher premiums at both its Insurance and Reinsurance segments. Strong international exposure, expanded capabilities and diversified product offerings will likely fuel premiums. The consensus mark is pegged at $2.7 billion, translating into a 6.5% improvement from the year-ago quarter.XL Group is projected to report higher net investment income in the quarter to be reported, driven by improved interest rates as well as better-than-expected reinvestment rates and portfolio management activities.Improved net investment income and premiums are expected to have supported the company’s top line. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the metric is pegged at $2.9 billion, representing a rise of 4.8% on a year-over-year basis.The company is likely to have witnessed an increase in operating expenses this yet-to-be-reported quarter, mainly due to higher net loss and loss expenses incurred as well as claims and policy benefits. This in turn might restrict the operating margin expansion as well.    But the company assumes that a rise in expenses will be a fraction of business growth, thereby continuing to drive the operating expense leverage.  As a property and casualty (P&C) insurer, XL Group is highly exposed to unpredictable weather-related events that result in substantial catastrophe loss. Therefore, the company might report cat loss in the soon-to-be-reported quarter, which is anticipated to impact the insurer’s results.    Nonetheless, the corporate tax cut, which lowered the tax rate to 21% from 35%, is expected to aid the companies’ bottom line and drive margin expansion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at 95 cents per share, reflecting an increase of a whopping 90% from the prior-year period.XL Group Ltd. Price and EPS Surprise  XL Group Ltd. Price and EPS Surprise | XL Group Ltd. Quote What the Quantitative Model Says    Our proven model does not conclusively show that XL Group is likely to beat on earnings this earning season. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: XL Group has an Earnings ESP of -5.80%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.  Zacks Rank: XL Group carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which lowers the predictive power of ESP. We caution against the Sell-rated stocks (4 or 5) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions. Stocks to ConsiderSome stocks worth considering from the insurance industry with the right combination of elements to surpass estimates this time around are as follows:American Financial Group, Inc. (AFG  -  Free Report) is set to report first-quarter earnings on May 2. The stock has an Earnings ESP of +4.46% and a Zacks Rank #2.

939,XL,"The Finance sector will kick off its earnings season this week with major banks reporting quarterly results. The sector’s performance will largely be driven by an improving rate environment, tax cuts, favorable operating environment and better domestic growth scenario. Per the Earnings Preview, earnings for the sector are expected to increase 19.2% on 4.5% higher revenues.Insurers, an important component of Finance sector, are due to report results starting next week. Earnings of the Insurance industry are estimated to grow 15% in the first quarter, given a number of tailwinds favoring its operating environment.Progressing Rate EnvironmentLast quarter marked the sixth rate hike by the Federal Reserve testifying economic stability. The rate now stands at 1.75% with intentions of two more raises in 2018 followed by three in 2019 as well as two in 2020.A Benign Cat EnvironmentThe first quarter of 2018 escaped the inclemency of Mother Nature, though there were cat events like California mudslide and northeast winter storms. A Morgan Stanley analyst estimates global insured cat loss in the first quarter between $5 billion and $10 billion.Nonetheless, insurers having already suffered the rigors of cat loss last year, could manage to weather its first-quarter shortfalls too. Underwriting profitability must have been affected, albeit at a lesser magnitude.However, price hikes, prudent underwriting practices, portfolio repositioning and resorting to reinsurance covers will help insurers withstand the deficits.Tax Reforms and Capital DeploymentPer the implementation of the new tax rate effective first quarter, the tax incidence has been lowered to 21% from 35%. Not only will this aid in margin expansion but also increase dividend payouts owing to rise in net profit available to shareholders.Insurers Assured Guaranty Ltd. has already approved a 12% increase in dividend while FBL Financial Group Inc. has approved a special dividend of $1.50 per share, hiking quarterly dividend by 4.5% and authorizing a share repurchase program of $50 million. Horace Mann Educators Corporation hiked quarterly dividend by 3.6%.Promising Economic NumbersJob growth has been solid through the first three months of 2018 with an average of nearly 0.202 million, better than 0.182 million a year ago.  Unemployment rate in March remained steady at 4.1% for the sixth straight month.Per Trading Economics global macro models and analysts expectations, the GDP growth rate for the quarter is estimated at 2.9%.Insurance Space Abounds With Consolidation CrazeThe last couple of years has set the stage for insurers to adopt an aggressive and positive approach toward the deal-making environment in 2018, mainly driven by an evolving industry and a proactive M&A environment.Apart from revamping taxation to make U.S. insurers more competitive globally, the tax overhaul provides a few good changes to make the M&A milieu more conducive to the players concerned. Moreover, other catalysts like pricing pressure and divestment of noncore assets have pushed acquirers to vie for a competitive edge in the buyout arena. Also given a continued capital inflow, the insurance industry’s available resources remain at an all-time high, helping insurers build a strong liquidity profile.A few high-profile deals struck in the first quarter are American International Group, Inc.’s (AIG  -  Free Report) decision to buy reinsurer Validus Holdings, Ltd. for $5.6 billion in cash. AXA Group’s 100% acquisition of XL Group Ltd (XL  -  Free Report) for $15.3 billion and Fidelity National Financial, Inc.’s agreement to purchase Stewart Information Services Corporation for a $1.2-billion cash-stock deal.Price PerformanceThe Insurance industry has underperformed the S&P 500 index since the onset of the first quarter. While the industry has decreased 7.9%, the elite index has declined 2.5%.Q1 OutperformersRiding high on tailwinds, insurers enjoyed a favorable operational backdrop to generate improved results. With the help of our Zacks Stock Screener, we identified stocks poised to outshine the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the first quarter.  Our proven model conclusively states that because of an ideal combination of the two ingredients — a positive Earnings ESPand a favorable Zacks Rank — the following stocks are likely to surpass expectations at their earnings announcement.

942,XL,"The insurance industry witnessed a change of fortunes in the first quarter of 2018 driven by better-than-expected performance mainly fueled by improving interest rates and economy, significantly lower catastrophe loss along with noteworthy tax reform effective Jan 1, 2018. Consequently, the industry is anticipated to deliver better-than-expected results and continue the momentum in the near term as well.Per a report by Fitch Ratings, the insurance industry is expected to regain its substantial underwriting profitability in 2018, albeit at a slow pace. Moreover, combined ratios are likely to improve and might come close to breakeven. Thus, insurance players can expect a better year in terms of catastrophe losses compared with the tumultuous journey in 2017.Notably, the interest rate hike in March, which also marks the sixth increase post recession, reflects stability in the economy. Improving rate environment will aid investment income which is an important component of insurers’ revenues. Further, following the Federal Reserve’s indication of increasing interest rates thrice in 2018 with the possibility of a fourth hike this year plus two more in 2019, we expect investment results to continue to show improvement.Apart from the rising interest rate environment, the property and casualty (P&C) insurers will also benefit from a broader invested asset base and alternative asset classes.Other factors like lower tax incidence, growing GDP and an improving employment scenario are likely to aid the insurers’ performance, going forward.The Property and Casualty Insurance industry is ranked at #184 (among bottom 31% of the Zacks Industry Rank for 267 industries) and it has underperformed the S&P 500 index’s gain of 1.7% year to date, registering a decrease of 0.1%.Here we focus on two P&C insurers. While Markel Corporation (MKL  -  Free Report) markets and underwrites specialty insurance products in the United States, the U.K., Canada, and internationally, XL Group Ltd. (XL  -  Free Report) operates as an insurance and reinsurance company globally. While Markel Corporation has a market capitalization of $15.9 billion, XL Group’s metric records $14.4 billion.It will be interesting to note which scores better in terms of fundamentals.Investors interested in the space can take a look at NMI Holdings, Inc. (NMIH  -  Free Report) and RLI Corp. (RLI  -  Free Report), both sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Q1 ScorecardIn the first quarter, Markel’s bottom-line and top-line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate, registering year-over-year improvement for both the metrics. However, XL Group missed the Zacks Consensus Estimates in terms of both the aforementioned metrics, even though both earnings and revenues improved on a year-over year basis.Earnings Surprise HistoryAs far as the companies’ surprise history goes, Markel has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the last four quarters with an average beat of 15.54%, whereas XL Group has missed the consensus mark in three out of the trailing four quarters with a negative surprise of 4.20%.Hence, Markel outshines XL Group in this round.Earnings Estimate Revisions and Growth ProjectionsMarkel’s 2018 estimates have 10.8% north and 1.9% up for 2019 in the last 30 days. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for XL Group’s both current-year and 2019 earnings have been revised downward by 0.3%.For XL Group, the consensus mark for 2018 earnings per share is estimated to grow 282.1% on 4.6% revenue improvement. For 2019, the company’s bottom line is expected to increase8.1% on 4.8% top-line rise.For Markel the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share in 2018 is projected to grow by a whopping 962.9% rallying on 12.6% revenue increase. For 2019, the bottom line is predicted to climb 1.2% on 6.3% revenue improvement.  In this case too, Markel gains advantage over XL Group.  Combined RatioCombined ratio, the percentage of premiums paid out as claims and expenses, determines the underwriting profitability of an insurer.Markel’s combined ratio was 90% in the first-quarter 2018 while XL Group’s came in at 95.3%. Markel wins this round.Debt-to-EquityBoth companies have higher debt-to-equity as compared with the industry average of 28.39%. However, XL Group with a leverage ratio of 28.84 has a slight edge over Markel’s ratio of 32.7.Return on EquityBoth Markel and XL Group’s respective return on equity of 1.47% and (3.75%) is substantially lower than the industry average of 5.25%. Therefore, between Markel and XL Group, the former is comparatively better positioned.Price PerformanceBoth Markel and XL Group have outpaced the industry year to date. While Markel’s shares have gained 0.9%, XL Group’s stock has rallied 58.5%. XL Group emerges a clear winner here.ValuationThe price to book value metric is the best multiple used for valuing insurers. Compared with the Property and Casualty Industry’s P/B ratio of 1.43, Markel is overvalued with a reading of 1.71. Meanwhile, XL Group is much cheaper with a trailing 12-month P/B multiple of 1.27. This round again goes to XL Group as its shares are cheaper than Markel’s.Dividend YieldIn this case, XL Group trumps Markel as the latter has not paid dividends since its inception. XL Group’s dividend yield was 1.58% in a year that outshines the industry’s average of 0.48%. Consequently, XL Group does not have any competition in this respect and emerges as the clear winner.Zacks RankWhile Markel sports a Zacks Rank #1, XL Group carries a Zacks Rank of 5 (Strong Sell).To ConcludeMarkel is positioned better than XL Group on the basis of rank, return on equity, combined ratio, Q1 scorecard and earnings surprise history as well as earnings estimate revisions and growth projections. However, considering parameters like price performance, valuation, debt-to-equity ratio and dividend yield, XL Group seems better off than Markel. Per our comparative analysis, Markel seems a more lucrative investment option than XL Group.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

944,XL,"The first-quarter earnings season has crossed halfway mark with already 267 members of the elite S&P 500 index having reported financial numbers so far.  Per the latest Earnings Preview, the beat ratio is impressive with 76.8% companies surpassing bottom-line expectations and a 73.8%, outperforming on the top-line front, thereby bearing evidence to a solid start. Combining the reported results with estimates for the yet-to-release companies, total earnings for the S&P 500 index are anticipated to be up 22.6% from the same period last year, driven by 8.4% growth in revenues.The Finance sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors) has delivered a strong performance till now. Per Earnings Preview, earnings are expected to rise 26.4% on 5.7% higher revenues.An important constituent of the Finance sector, the insurance industry is likely to witness better results this yet-to-be-reported quarter on the back of an improving rate environment, tax cuts, a favorable operating environment and a better domestic growth scenario.A progressing interest rate environment is likely to have driven solid net investment income, a chief component of an insurer’s top line. Though the metric is far from achieving a historical high, it nonetheless shows an upward trend. Notably, the Fed has hiked interest rate five times since December 2015 on the back of a flourishing economy and has expressed intention to raise the same twice more this year, followed by three in 2019 and a couple of in 2020.Although insurers have curbed their exposure to interest-sensitive product lines to withstand the low rate environment, they look to take advantage of the increasing rates as investment yield betters.The first quarter is likely to gain an edge from the tax cut.  Per the new tax law effective January 2018, the tax incidence has been decreased to 21% from 35%. This lowering of the rate has added an impetus to insurers’ bottom line.Although the to-be-reported quarter stumbled upon a California mudslide as well as the northeast winter storms, the company’s underwriting profitability might still be left unscathed despite the cat events. Insurers having already suffered the hazards of weather-related loss in 2017, should have managed to make up for the underperformances in the first quarter of 2018. A Morgan Stanley analyst projects global insured cat loss between $5 billion and $10 billion. Underwriting profitability also seems slightly burdened.However, improved pricing, intelligent underwriting practices, portfolio restructuring as well as taking recourse to reinsurance covers might have shielded insurers to overcome the deficits.A varied product portfolio, global growth and tactical M&A activity are expected to have boosted insurers’ operations in the impending quarterly release.About 900 companies (142 S&P 500 members) are set to report quarterly results this week. Let’s see how things shape up for a few good insurers below before their earnings announcement on May 2.American International Group, Inc. (AIG  -  Free Report) is expected to witness flat to a slight decline in revenues due to its ongoing efforts in managing the overall business portfolio via reinsurance and divestitures. Low tax rate and share buyback should boost bottom line. Premiums and deposits at Life Insurance business are expected to increase led by strong growth in both term and universal life insurance sales. However, in General Insurance business, premiums are expected to decline due to the company’s remediation of underperforming lines and divestitures.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.24 per share for the soon-to-be-reported quarter highlights an 8.8% year-over-year fall. AIG carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), which decreases the predictive power of ESP. Although its Earnings ESP of +1.78% makes us confident about an earnings surprise, the stock’s bearish Zacks Rank leaves surprise prediction inconclusive.

Tax reform will likely expand Lincoln National’s margin. Its balance sheet strength and a sturdy capital inflow are also part of the estimate.The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.94 for the soon-to-be-reported quarter, inching up 1% year over year. Though Lincoln has a favorable Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), an Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.

As a big investor in the U.S. fixed income market, MetLife should have benefited from economic growth, leading to higher interest rates. However, earnings in Retirement and Income Solutions should be pressured by the flatter yield curve.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.17 per share for the last completed quarter translates into a 19.9% year-over-year decline. MetLife carries a Zacks Rank of 3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. Nonetheless, its Earnings ESP of -0.06% leaves our surprise prediction inconclusive as the company also needs a positive ESP to increase the odds of an earnings surprise.

(PRU  -  Free Report) is expected to have witnessed bottom-line growth in the soon-to-be-reported quarter owing to recurring premium sales, expanded product offerings, broader distribution capabilities and share buybacks. Core performance of its businesses is mainly fueled by higher fees in its Annuities and Investment Management segments as well as sustained business growth in International Insurance. However, increase in expenses, mainly due to higher insurance and annuity benefits plus general and administrative expenses, is likely to have weighed on the desired margin expansion.The consensus mark of $2.99 per share for the last completed quarter represents a 7.2% year-over-year rise. Prudential’s weak Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) combined with an Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction unlikely.

Lower tax should have driven the bottom line as well as margin expansion. The company might have witnessed an increase in operating expenses this yet-to-be-reported quarter, mainly due to higher net loss and loss expenses incurred as well as on claims and policy benefits. This in turn is anticipated to limit the operating margin expansion as well.The consensus estimate of 95 cents per share reflects a 90% year-over-year improvement.

948,XL,"The U.S. Insurance Industry faced challenges in 2017 that put pressure on the deal-making environment to a large extent. Starting from a tepid economic environment to extremely unpredictable weather conditions, the insurance industry bore the brunt of all. Despite these trials, the industry still managed to complete 350 mergers and acquisitions (M&A) in the year per a report by the London-based law, firm Clyde &Co. Even though the above-mentioned deal volume was considerably lower than the previous year, the same is anticipated to rise in 2018.Interestingly, the last couple of years has set the stage for insurers to take an aggressive and positive approach toward the deal-making environment in 2018, mainly driven by an evolving industry and M&A environment.With the gradually stabilizing economy and rising interest rates along with a buoyed investor and consumer confidence, the insurance industry has been putting in conscious efforts to complete a greater number of consolidations this year. This in turn will also help insurers achieve strategic objectives, more so because the M&A route essentially paves the way for attaining growth.Driving Factors for a Positive M&A LandscapeThe recent tax reform, effective Jan 1, 2018, reducing the tax rate to 21% from 35% and thus calling for a $1.5-trillion tax cut, is expected to benefit the insurance industry to a large extent. Besides redesigning taxation to make U.S. insurers more competitive globally, the tax overhaul provides a few changes to make the M&A environment more conducive.Further, technology will provide an impetus to insurers to likely drive M&A growth in 2018. Technology will also help the insurance companies develop new products, enhance client base and loyalty, boost distribution strategies as well as propel efficiencies. Considering the strategic need for technology investments, InsurTech has risen to prominence in the industry. Hence, acquiring technology assets is set to be a tactical driver for deals in 2018, despite the small size of such deals.On the back of continued capital inflow, the insurance industry’s available capital resource remains at an all-time high, which has helped insurers build a strong liquidity profile. A robust capital position will lend enough support to insurers to pursue bigger and important deals in the near term, also keeping the industry’s growth trend alive.Also, with the probability of alternative sources of capital flowing into new areas, beyond the traditional business lines, there will be additional pressure on pricing leading to some businesses available for sale.Additionally, divesting noncore assets for competitive and regulatory concerns, is being considered by many insurers. Through this process, the strategies of such companies will come into focus, resulting in shedding of more business lines this year.A Few Noteworthy Deals So Far This YearThe insurance industry witnessed some high-profile deals being announced and accomplished in the past couple of months. For instance, on Jan 22, 2018, American International Group, Inc. (AIG  -  Free Report) decided to buy reinsurer Validus Holdings, Ltd. (VR) for $5.6 billion in cash. The buyout is anticipated to be immediately accretive to American International Group’s earnings and return on equity (ROE).This apart, a milestone decision was taken by AXA Group on Mar 5, 2018 to acquire 100% of XL Group Ltd (XL  -  Free Report) for $15.3 billion and creating the leading global property and casualty (P&C) Commercial lines insurer based on gross written premiums.Another such deal refers to Fidelity National Financial, Inc.’s agreement (FNF  -  Free Report) to acquire Stewart Information Services Corporation (STC) for $1.2 billion in a cash-stock deal on Mar 19, 2018. The transaction is expected to culminate in the first or second quarter of 2019, subject to closing conditions.Stocks in FocusThe insurance industry is pretty certain that the M&A activity will be back in form this year, mostly attributable to the factors discussed above as well the concerns regarding a soft economic climate and fast-changing regulations starting to diminish.We have zeroed in on four outperforming stocks in the thriving insurance industry with a promise to generate better returns despite all odds based on price performance, positive estimate revisions, a favorable Zacks Rank and an impressive Growth Score of A or B.

949,XL,"Timing a Fed rate hike is no doubt tricky. But if you ask the market participants, they are almost certain that Jerome Powell led Federal Reserve will increase its benchmark rate by 0.25%, at the conclusion of the FOMC meeting on Mar 21. They further anticipate the Fed to continue their hawkish stance this year, on the back of a healthy labor market and steady rise in inflation.With the Fed set to raise rates for the first time this year, expect financials, technology and home improvement suppliers to benefit. Home builders and utility players, on the other hand, could lose from the Fed’s rate decision.Fed Set to Hike Rates for the First Time in 2018At the conclusion of the FOMC meeting, the Fed will issue a rate decision. Market pundits consider a quarter-percentage point rate hike a near-certainty. The futures market is already indicating 100% chance of a rate hike, culminating into the sixth rate increase since December 2015. Market participants also widely expect the Fed to project four rate hikes this year. So far, a maximum of three rate hikes are expected for the year.But why we are expecting a hawkish Fed? This is because the current economic backdrop paints a rosy picture, especially, when you consider steady rise in wages, record low unemployment rate and upbeat consumer confidence levels. The Trump administration, in the meantime, has decided to add extra stimulus in the form of tax cuts and deregulations.Perhaps the even more crucial factor for the Fed to hike rates is hotter-than-expected signs of inflation. Recent signs indicate that inflation is tilting toward the central bank’s 2% annual target. Needless to say, the near-term inflation expectations have climbed this month to the highest level in three years. Thus, the Fed is likely to reiterate its January’s statement that inflation “will move up this year.”Winners & Losers in a Rising Rate EnvironmentWith an overwhelming majority of observers seeing an imminent rate hike with more to follow this year, certain sectors stand to gain, while some will suffer.Winners: Asset-Sensitive BanksBanks are definitely the go-to rate trade. As a general rule, higher interest rates will boost bank profits as they increase the spread between what banks earn by funding longer-term assets, such as loans, with shorter-term liabilities.National banks like the Bank of America Corporation (BAC  -  Free Report) are very much rate-sensitive and have consistently seen earnings jump from a quarter-point rate hike. In the year-to-date period, the SPDR S&P Bank ETF (KBE) generated steady returns of 4.2% on increasing expectations of a rate hike this month.Winners: InsurersVery few companies are rooting for a rate hike as much as those from the insurance industry. And why not? The relationship between interest rates and insurance companies is linear and straightforward, meaning the higher the rate, the greater the growth.Insurers derive their investment income from investing premiums, which are received from policyholders in corporate and government bonds. Yields and coupons on these bonds rise in response to a rise in Fed fund rates and bank interest rates. This enables life insurers to invest their premiums at higher yields and earn more investment income, expanding their profit margins. Not only investment income, which is an important component of insurers’ top line, annuity sales should also benefit from a higher rate environment.As of the last filing, the top three holdings of the SPDR S&P Insurance ETF (KIE), Validus Holdings, Ltd. (VR  -  Free Report), XL Group Ltd (XL  -  Free Report) and Everest Re Group, Ltd. (RE  -  Free Report) have soared 44.6%, 58.1% and 18.2%, respectively, so far this year on rate hike expectations.Winners: Asset ManagersBrokerage firms and asset managers advantage immensely from a rising rate environment since an increase in rates generally concurs during periods of economic strength and upbeat investor sentiments.Notably, a wealth management firm like The Charles Schwab Corporation (SCHW  -  Free Report) has said time and again that each quarter point increase in rates generally adds to interest revenue, much of which flows directly to pre-tax profits.Winners: Technology & Home ImprovementOther than the broader financial sector, technology firms also stand to gain from a rate hike. Interest rates correlate with an economy that is getting stronger day by day. And a stronger economy could easily boost the bottom lines of smartphone makers like Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) and Samsung.Rising rates may also compel would-be home buyers to stop searching for new houses and instead look for improving their existing ones. Sesha Dhanyamraju, CEO of Digital Risk added that “remodelers and home-improvement suppliers benefit from a rising-rate scenario.” Thus, home improvement majors Lowe’s Cos. (L  -  Free Report) and Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report) stand to gain the most.Losers: Home ConstructionBut, with the Fed expected to hike rates, the average American will bear the brunt of higher borrowing costs. This is surely a dampener to real estate activities.James Cassel, chairman and co-founder of the investment banking firm Cassel Salpeter in Miami added that if rate hike happens, losers might include “construction-related businesses, like homebuilders.”Losers: UtilitiesInvesting in utilities won’t be a good idea in a rising interest rate scenario. Utilities are capital intensive business and the funds generated from internal sources are not always sufficient to meet their requirements. Hence, these companies have high level of debt loads. Low interest rates will help them pay off debts and book profits.But higher interest rates along with an increase in the debt level, for that matter a steep debt/equity ratio, impact the credit ratings of these utility operators. If the credit ratings go down, a company will find it difficult to borrow funds from the markets at reasonable rates, leading to a rise in cost of operations.The industry’s bellwether ETF, Utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU), has yielded a negative return of 4.9% in the year-to-date period on rate hike concerns.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars? Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

955,XL,"Investors in XL Group Ltd (XL  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Mar 16, 2018 $38.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for XL Group shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, XL Group is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Insurance - Property and Casualty industry that ranks in the Top 38% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, two analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while none have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 93 cents per share to 97 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about XL Group right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options? Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

956,XL,"AXA Group has inked an acquisition deal to buy XL Group Ltd (XL  -  Free Report) for $15.3 billion in cash. The transaction is expected to conclude in the second half of 2018, subject to customary closing conditions and an approval pending from XL Group’s shareholders.The purchase is likely to help AXA Group emerge a leader in the bracket of global Property and Casualty Commercial lines insurers based on gross written premiums.Following this announcement, shares of XL Group have surged 31.06% in the pre-market trading session.The Purchase ConsiderationValued at $15.3 billion or €12.4 billion, the deal translates into a 33% premium to XL Group’s closing price of $43.30 on Mar 2. Therefore, shareholders of the company to be acquired will now be entitled to receive $57.60 per share.Financing the DealAXA Group will utilize €3.5 billion cash in hand, €6 billion from the planned initial public offering in the United States and €3 billion subordinated debt. The acquirer already has €9 billion of backup bridge financing in place.Acquisition RationaleFrench insurer AXA Group is primarily focused on Life and Saving insurance business. This acquisition is in sync with its strategy to intensify focus on Property and Casualty insurance business. The company has also filed for an initial public offering in the United States for its US business and is already a leading life insurance and annuity company in the region.With $15 billion of gross written premiums in 2017, XL Group scores as a premier provider in P&C Commercial and Tier 1 specialty lines with its solid presence across North America, Europe, Lloyd’s platform as well as the Asia-Pacific zone.Shares of XL Group have rallied 23.2%, outperforming the industry’s nearly 1% gain year to date. While AXA Group’s reinsurance business provides key access to its diversification and alternative capital, it has robust links to the large and mid-market segments. Thus XL Group’s integration into the acquirer’s portfolio is a strategic fit for the company.Additionally, XL Group is anticipated to leverage AXA Group to build scale, widen its geographic exposure as well as expand its product portfolio.AXA Group estimates pre-tax annual savings of about $0.4 billion consisting of $0.2 billion from cost synergies, $0.1 billion from revenue synergies and $0.1 billion through reinsurance net of additional reinsurance bought to align with AXA Group’s risk appetite.The buyout is cash accretive with more than 80% remittance ratio drawn from XL Group and the same will possibly dilute the impact for IPO in 2018 itself. Also, once complete, the acquisition is expected to lower sensitivities to financial markets, reduce beta and cost of equity, enhance cash remittance potential and accelerate the company’s growth profile. Return on investment is estimated to be 10%.AXA Group reaffirmed its Ambition 2020 target to grow earnings by 3-7%.Zacks RankXL Group carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). With the acquisition projected to add synergies to both companies, we expect analysts to raise their estimates for driving the Zacks Rank.Insurers Following SuitFollowing the organic route, ramping up one’s operational profile seems a well-accepted strategy among insurers as acquisitions create a rage in the insurance domain.

960,XL,"The fourth-quarter earnings season is in full swing with 133 members of the elite S&P 500 index having already reported financial numbers so far.  Per the latest Earnings Preview, performances of these index members indicate that total earnings have increased 12.3% on 8.8% higher revenues. The beat ratio is impressive with 81.2% companies surpassing bottom-line expectations and 78.9%, outperforming on the top-line front.The Finance sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors) has delivered a strong performance till now.Per Earnings Preview, earnings are expected to grow 8.4% on 2.4% higher revenues.Integral to the Finance sector, the insurance industry is likely to witness better results this yet-to-be-reported quarter compared with the third. Underwriting profitability continued to be hurt in the fourth quarter by the wildfires in California. This downside added to the woes with the catastrophe modeling firm AIR Worldwide estimating losses at approximately $10.5 billion.However, such a massive loss led insures to brave the price hike that remained flat due to a not-so-active catastrophe environment. This in turn has helped improving the premiums and driving the top line as well.Also, prudent underwriting practices aided insurers to weather the cat event.Net investment income, an important component of an insurer’s top line, is anticipated to have increased on the back of an improving rate environment. Though the same witnesses progress at a slower pace, the impact of rate increase is clearly visible in the insurer’s investment results. The Fed delivered its promise of three hikes in 2017, the last one made in December.Diverse product offerings, a wide geographic footprint and strong client retention likely have enhanced insurers’ performance in the quarter to be reported.With 400 companies (121 S&P 500 members) set to announce earnings this week, let’s find out where the following insurers stand before their quarterly releases on Feb 1.Cigna Corp’s (CI  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter performance should reflect growth in total enrollment and specialty relationships, continued effective medical cost management and operating expense discipline, and strong capital management.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 26 cents per share for the yet-to-be-reported quarter reflects a 108.9% year-over-year slump.

961,XL,"XL Group Ltd (XL  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 1 after the market closes. Last quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 2.83%.Let’s see, how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to be Considered This QuarterThe occurrence of the California wildfires is anticipated to have a significant impact on XL Group’s fourth-quarter results. In fact, the property and casualty insurer has projected total pre-tax catastrophe loss, net of reinsurance, reinstatement and adjusted premiums plus redeemable non-controlling interest amounting to $315 million. Losses at such level will thus hamper the company’s underwriting profitability.Such a massive loss might lead to noticeably deteriorating the combined ratio as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the metric in the to-be-reported period is pegged at 92%.Further, the company has likely witnessed an increase in operating expenses in the soon-to-be-reported quarter, mainly due to higher net loss and loss expenses incurred, claims and policy benefits as well as forex loss. This in turn might restrict the operating margin expansion as well.Notably, for 2017 the company expects operating expenses to be about $1.77 billion.Thanks to the recent corporate tax rate cut, the P&C insurer might incur a charge of $98 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 due to revaluation of its net Deferred Tax Asset. However, it is important to mention here that the charge will not have a material impact on the company’s fourth-quarter operating net income.Despite the interest rate hikes, the company is anticipating a fall in net investment income due to the still low-interest rate environment.Nonetheless, the company is likely to witness improvement in gross premiums written in the soon-to-be-reported quarter, fueled by higher premiums at both its Insurance and Reinsurance segments.Additionally, continued share buybacks have likely cushioned the company’s bottom line. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 49 cents, representing a year-over-year increase of 4.3%.What Our Quantitative Model SaysOur proven model does not conclusively show that XL Group is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: XL Group has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 49 cents. A company's 0.00% ESP also makes suprise prediction difficult. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.XL Group Ltd. Price and EPS Surprise  XL Group Ltd. Price and EPS Surprise | XL Group Ltd. Quote Zacks Rank: XL Group holds a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), which lowers the predictive power of ESP.  We caution against all Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderSome stocks worth considering from the insurance industry with the right combination of elements to surpass estimates this time around are as follows:American Equity Investment Life Holding Company (AEL  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter earnings on Feb 7. The stock has an Earnings ESP of +1.12% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Primerica, Inc.

962,XL,"AXIS Capital Holdings Limited (AXS  -  Free Report) has recently announced preliminary estimates of its total net financial impact from fourth-quarter 2017 catastrophe and weather-related losses as well as its initial assessment of the recently revised tax cut.The property and casualty (P&C) insurer has projected total catastrophe loss, net of tax and estimated recoveries from reinsurance and retrocessional covers including the impact of estimated reinstatement premiums to be $130 million. Such losses are expected to noticeably impact the company’s fourth-quarter results. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $1.11, which reflects a year-over-year decline of 2.6%.The loss comprises $54 million stemming from the Northern California wildfires and $38 million each from Southern California wildfires and other weather-related events. The company had earlier expected loss from Northern California wildfires to be between $$35 million and $45 million. Both Insurance and Reinsurance segments have suffered due to exposure to the catastrophe event.Exposure to catastrophe events put a considerable dent in the company’s underwriting results, rendering volatility in the company’s earnings. The fourth quarter too will not be an exception. The company had already suffered underwriting loss of $700 million with combined ratio deteriorating 2240 basis points year over year through the first nine months. The loss stemmed mainly from hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria and also the two major Mexico earthquakes.  Among other P&C insurers having released respective fourth-quarter catastrophe loss estimates, Arch Capital Group Ltd. (ACGL  -  Free Report) projects pre-tax catastrophe loss between $60 million and $75 million while XL Group Ltd (XL  -  Free Report) expects to incur a catastrophe loss of $315 million from the Californian wildfires and other cat events. This apart, Chubb Limited (CB  -  Free Report) estimates pre-tax catastrophe loss of about $320 million ($249 million after-tax), stemming from natural catastrophes including the wildfires.Last year, the P&C insurers faced the biggest brunt of a massive catastrophe loss, having largely impacted the industry and qualifying the year as the costliest in terms of incurring weather-related loss. Notably, per Swiss Re, total economic loss from natural and man-made disasters in 2017 are projected at $306 billion. The wildfires in the fourth quarter also added to the woes with catastrophe modeling firm AIR Worldwide estimating losses to reach up to $10.5 billion. However, thanks to a cat loss of huge magnitude, insurers braved price hikes, which remained flat in the past several quarters due to a not so active catastrophe environment. This in turn will help such insurers generate more premiums and mitigate cat loss in the near term.Per the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, effective January 2018, the corporate tax rate was slashed to 21% from the pre-existent 35%. As a result, this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) will incur a charge of $42 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 due to revaluation of its net Deferred Tax Asset. However, the charge will not have a material impact on the company’s fourth-quarter net income.  Shares of AXIS Capital have lost 12.3% against the industry’s increase of 6.8% since the onset of the fourth quarter of 2017. The stock has also witnessed the Zacks Consesnus Estimate for 2018 earnings being moved nearly 0.7% south in the last 60 days. Nonetheless, we expect the company’s focus on expanding its business lines, strategic acquisitions to fuel improvement in premiums and a solid capital position to turn the stock around in the near term. AXIS Capital is expected to report fourth-quarter results on Feb 7.  However, our proven model does not conclusively show that the stock is likely to beat on earnings this season. This is because it has a bearish Zacks Rank of 5, which lowers the predictive power of ESP and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, which makes surprise prediction difficult.Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2018 In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2018?Last year's 2017 Zacks Top 10 Stocksportfolio produced double-digit winners, including FMC Corp. and VMware which racked up stellar gains of +67.9% and +61%.

963,XL,"XL Group Ltd (XL  -  Free Report) has recently announced preliminary net catastrophe loss estimates for the fourth quarter of 2017 as well as its initial assessment of the recently revised tax cut.XL Group anticipates net catastrophe loss of about $45 million, stemming from the recent wildfires in Southern California and another $20 million from other weather-related events. These estimated losses will be evenly divided between the company’s Insurance and Reinsurance segments.The property and casualty (P&C) insurer has projected total pre-tax catastrophe loss, net of reinsurance, reinstatement and adjusted premiums plus redeemable non-controlling interest amounting to $315 million to noticeably impact the company’s fourth-quarter results. The abovementioned loss estimate comprises the previous projection of $250 million pertaining to the October 2017 Northern California wildfires and other cat events.These losses are expected to put a considerable dent in the company’s underwriting results, rendering volatility in the company’s earnings. Throughout the first nine months of 2017, the company suffered underwriting loss of $909.1 million, which compared unfavorably with the underwriting profit of $431.9 million. Moreover, the company’s combined ratio will take a hit on such losses. Combined ratio for the first nine months of 2017 came in at 111.6%, deteriorating 1770 bps from the same period in 2016.Among other P&C insurers that have released their respective fourth-quarter catastrophe loss estimates, Arch Capital Group Ltd.’s (ACGL  -  Free Report) projects pre-tax catastrophe loss comes in between $60 million and $75 million while RenaissanceRe Holdings Ltd. (RNR  -  Free Report) expects to incur a catastrophe loss of $90 million from the California wildfires. This apart, Chubb Limited (CB  -  Free Report) estimates pre-tax catastrophe loss of about $320 million ($249 million after-tax), stemming from natural catastrophes including California wildfires.Per the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, effective from January 2018 onward, the corporate tax rate was slashed to 21% from the pre-existent 35%. As a result, the Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) P&C insurer will incur a charge of $98 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 due to revaluation of its net Deferred Tax Asset. It is important to note here that the charge will not have a material impact on the company’s fourth-quarter operating net income.Shares of XL Group have lost 10.8% since the onset of the fourth quarter of 2017 against the industry’s increase of 6.8%. However, we expect the company’s focus on its insurance and reinsurance business lines, resulting in the best return on capital over pricing cycle along with a solid capital position to turn the stock around in the near term.  XL Group is expected to report fourth-quarter results on Feb 7.  However, our proven model does not conclusively show that the stock is likely to beat on earnings this season. This is because it carries a bearish Zacks Rank of 5, which lowers the predictive power of ESP and also has an Earnings ESP of 12.26%, which leaves the combination inconclusive.Wall Street’s Next Amazon Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

964,XL,"Arch Capital Group Ltd (ACGL  -  Free Report) has announced estimated pre-tax catastrophe loss for the fourth quarter of 2017 as well as the impact of the recently revised tax cut.The company projects pre-tax catastrophe loss between $60 million and $75 million for the period. The losses stemmed from wildfires of Northern California as well as other catastrophic events.Being a property and casualty insurer, Arch Capital could not escape the vagaries of natural disasters inducing volatility in underwriting results. Last quarter was also bruised by $319.8 million cat loss, having stemmed from a devastating hurricane activity; inducing an underwriting loss of $142.2 million. Combined ratio deteriorated 2430 basis points. Through the first nine months of 2017, the company’s underwriting income declined 26.3% from the same period in 2016.Among other property and casualty insurers, XL Group plc (XL  -  Free Report) estimates pre-tax catastrophe loss of $250 million while RenaissanceRe Holdings Ltd. (RNR  -  Free Report) expects to incur catastrophe loss of $90 million from the California wildfires.President Donald Trump has signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act into law on Dec 22, 2017. This resulted in slashing the corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%, effective from January 2018 onward. As a result, Arch Capital expects to write down a portion of its deferred tax asset by about $15-$20 million in the fourth quarter of 2017.Also, Arch Capital projects effective tax rate on pre-tax operating income between 17% and 20% for the fourth quarter. This, in turn, is likely to boost the bottom line.Recently, Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. (HIG  -  Free Report) announced that this rate cut is anticipated to affect its net deferred tax asset position, based on its current accounting guidance as well as net deferred tax assets at the end of the first nine months of 2017. This is also likely to hit its risk-based capitalization levels. The company expects fourth-quarter results to witness a reduction of nearly $850 million due to the impact of the tax cut.Shares of Arch Capital have lost 11.4% versus the industry’s increase of 8.3% since the onset of the fourth quarter of 2017. Nonetheless, the stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings being moved north 1.3% over the last 30 days. Robust premium growth on a compelling product portfolio, expansion of U.S. Mortgage Insurance business, solid inorganic growth and a strong capital position should help the stock bounce back. Arch Capital carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The company is scheduled to report fourth-quarter results on Feb 12. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in the quarter to be reported is pegged at $1.28 per share on revenues of $1.2 billion, reflecting a 13.3% year-over-year bottom-line growth and an 11.7% increase in the company’s top line.  Our proven model shows that the company is likely to beat estimates this quarter per an ideal combination of the two strong ingredients: a Zacks Rank of 3, which increases the predictive power of ESP and an Earnings ESP of +1.02%, which makes us confident of a likely positive earnings surprise.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

965,XL,"It is expected that 2017 will be one of the costliest years for U.S. insured catastrophe losses, but a strong capital base, efficient risk management and ample earnings capacity should help Property & Casualty (P&C) insurers absorb the losses. However, the carriers’ futures still look bleak with persistent industry concerns. What’s worse, the rising rate environment is also not expected to lend any major support.The key factor that might hurt P&C insurers’ financials is lack of pricing power. While insurers are pricing their policies to address perils in the disaster-prone areas, overall market softening prevails in both commercial and personal lines.However, personal auto insurers that have raised premium rates to deal with increasing accident frequency and severity trends are on the mend. An expected stabilization of frequency trends with increasing adoption of accident avoidance technologies should lead to better underwriting results for auto insurers in the quarters ahead.In terms of interest rates, P&C insurers typically don’t benefit significantly from a rising rate environment, as their business models are not too sensitive to interest rates. But, although P&C insurers could not benefit from the gradually rising interest rates over the past two years, the Fed’s latest rate hike and a likely acceleration of the pace going forward might translate to some advantage for the industry.However, increasing demand for P&C insurance with overall economic growth perhaps attracted investors’ attention lately, helping this segment perform close to the broader market. The Zacks P&C Insurance Industry has gained 17.8% since the beginning of the year compared with the S&P 500’s rally of 20.2%.This rally may not last long with the likely downside gradually fading investors’ optimism.On the other hand, while a strong job market and increasing disposable income will lead to more car and home purchases and thus increase insurable exposure, the rising rate environment may make these less affordable.Why Little to No Benefit Expected from Rate Hike P&C insurers’ financials are less sensitive to interest rates than life insurers, as the large financial portfolios managed by these carriers are designed to be fairly conservative. Meaning, they keep the required fund on hand to cover claims that they typically face faster than life insurers. Due to this, they depend significantly on short-term Treasury bills.For P&C insurers, the interest rate sensitivity has both positive and negative directions. Whether the upside offsets the downside is yet to be seen. This will become clear when either the magnitude or the pace of rate hike increases.Higher rates would boost P&C insurers’ investment income that declined substantially in the prolonged low-rate environment. However, the key downside is a significant amount of bonds in P&C insurers’ portfolio losing value if rates are hiked steadily and sizably.P&C insurers’ extreme sensitivity to asset inflation will aggravate the situation. In other words, the value of the properties insured by carriers will appreciate with an improving real estate market, increasing their potential liabilities from claims. This may outpace the rising yields on bonds they added to their portfolios for covering the claims. In fact, the bonds in their portfolios will lose value with rising interest rates and could ultimately result in capital volatility.Addressing this concern would require P&C insurers to add more risky assets to their investment portfolios to meet the rising liabilities from claims. This would eventually increase their costs.Market Softening to Keep Top Line Under Pressure Looking beyond the implications of a relatively sluggish pace of rate hike so far, it is market softening that burdens the P&C insurance industry. In order to retain renewals and secure new business, carriers are aggressively reducing rates and making the market buyer-friendly. While the recent severe catastrophes will lead to an increase in premiums in some areas, the overall recovery in prices is not expected to be visible any time soon thanks to the ample supply of capital.The softening was evident right through 2015 and has continued so far this year. Pricing is primarily soft in the areas of commercial property, workers' compensation, general liability and business interruption.By its very nature, a soft market causes lower underwriting profitability for carriers, as they prioritize market share gain over making more from premiums to survive.While greater demand for insurance (particularly with the emergence new insurable risks including cyber threat) will keep the business of P&C insurers afloat, their willingness to negotiate on policy terms and ample capital strength will intensify the competition for market share in the quarters ahead.Sluggish Recovery Might ContinueIncreasing frequency and severity of natural catastrophes give P&C insurers the scope to bump up pricing. Also, these might lead to an accelerated pace of policy renewals.Moreover, ample underwriting capacity, a strong liquidity profile and evolving coverage opportunity should help P&C carriers keep growing.Concerns related to weak capital levels are now things of the past, as the industry’s capital position has been building up with earnings growth and policyholders' surpluses. The industry has also been witnessing continued inflow of alternative capital (which is one of the reasons for market softening).As P&C insurers hold about two-thirds of their invested assets in the form of bonds, their capacity is highly sensitive to changes in credit market conditions. With the credit market showing resilience and limited possibility of a sudden spike in interest rates, insurers are likely to incur lesser realized and unrealized capital losses in the quarters ahead.Competition is heating up both within the primary lines of the P&C space and with the expansion of reinsurers. However, we expect proactive transformational measures, including the adoption of technology solutions, to bring competitive advantages.Also, for more enthusiasm in renewals and to meet the evolving demands of policyholders, insurers are in the process of product reframing and innovation. This should help them expand their customer base for products that will offer higher margins.   The emerging risks related to cyber threats are also giving P&C insurers scope to capitalize on. This segment, though relatively small in size, has been witnessing continued growth in premium and policy count.How to Play the IndustryThe absence of any significant support from the interest rate environment and the likely continuation of the soft market will hold P&C insurers back from showing any measurable progress in the near term. In fact, stiff competition may pose significant challenges to bottom-line growth for some carriers. As such, avoiding stocks with an unfavorable Zacks Rank should be the right strategy.We strongly suggest staying away from or getting rid of the following bottom-ranked stocks:XL Group Ltd (XL  -  Free Report): This Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock has lost 4.9% year to date versus the S&P 500’s gain of 20.2%. The stock’s Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year earnings has been revised significantly downward over the last 60 days.Hallmark Financial Services (HALL  -  Free Report): A 50% downward revision in the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year over the last 60 days precipitated a Zacks Rank #5 for this stock as well. The stock has lost 6.8% since the beginning of the year.However, as there are some reasons to be optimistic about P&C insurers’ growth potential, buying some stocks from the space based on a favorable Zacks Rank would be a prudent decision now.Here are a couple of top-ranked P&C insurance stocks you may want to consider:Alleghany Corporation (Y  -  Free Report): A substantial upward revision in the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year over the last 60 days lead to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for this stock.

966,XL,"Similar to wise buying decisions, exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns. Selling off losers can be difficult, but if both the share price and estimates are falling, it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio.One such stock that you may want to consider dropping is XL Group Ltd (XL  -  Free Report), which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks, and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year. A Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) further confirms weakness in XL.A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions. For the full year, we have seen three estimates moving down in the past 30 days, compared with no upward revisions. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower, going from a loss of $1.36 a share a month ago to its current level of a loss of $1.96.Also, for the current quarter, XL Group has seen three downward estimate revisions versus no revisions in the opposite direction, dragging the consensus estimate down to 47 cents a share from 99 cents over the past 30 days. The stock also has seen some pretty dismal trading lately, as the share price has dropped 8.3% in the past month.XL Group Ltd.

967,XL,"The effect of the highly talked-about Hurricane Irma was weaker than feared in Florida but the level of destruction was still pretty high. The cost of the storm varies from analyst to analyst. As per the guardian, “the economic cost of Hurricane Irma could rise as high as $300 billion” as it ravaged homes, businesses and farms on its way up.Insured losses from Hurricane Irma are projected from $20bn to $65bn, according to risk modelling companies, as per an article published on Financial Times. On the other hand, AccuWeather founder, ""estimated that Hurricane Harvey is to be the costliest weather disaster in U.S. history at $190 billion or one full percentage point of the GDP.”Damage estimate caused by Irma is expected to be about $100 billion or 0.5 percentage point of total GDP. AccuWeather estimates these two disasters (Harvey and Irma) will account for about 1.5 of a percentage point of the GDP.That said, let’s discuss the key areas that call for attention right now for profits or losses.Gasoline: Helped by Harvey, Marred by IrmaHarvey has thumped a quarter of oil production from the Gulf of Mexico and a substantial portion of the U.S. refining capacity. Lower demand from refineries put pressure on crude oil prices and ETFs like Oil Fund LP USO. However, demand for finished product gasoline rose, benefiting United States Gasoline Fund (UGA  -  Free Report). As crack spread rose, VanEck Vectors Oil Refiners ETF (CRAK  -  Free Report) gained.However, Irma weighed on natural gas futures by cutting demand from power plants, and will likely hurt oil and refined products’ prices by obstructing shipments to the nation’s third-largest gasoline market. Irma has quashed power to 3.3 million customers, brought tanker traffics to a halt and shut about 6,000 gasoline stations. United States Natural Gas Fund LP UNG was off 2.7% on Sep 8 and CRAK lost 0.2%.Agriculture ETFs to Rule Ahead?First, Harvey washed away the largest U.S. cotton producer, drenching extra supplies stored on fields by many Texas farmers. Then Irma may ruin Florida’s farmlands, ravaging $1.2 billion worth of fresh tomatoes, oranges, green beans, squash and sugar cane. After impacting the eastern coast of Florida, Irma is expected to shift to Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina — states famous for cotton, grain and livestock, as per CNBC.Needless to say, against this backdrop, iPath Pure Beta Livestock ETN LSTK, PowerShares DB Agriculture ETF (DBA  -  Free Report), iPath Pure Beta Cotton ETN CTNN and Teucrium Sugar Fund (CANE  -  Free Report) may be up for gains (read: Hurricane Irma: ETF Winners & Losers).Can Insurance Industry Survive the Storm?With huge destruction in Texas and Florida, insured losses could be sky high. Property and casualty insurance companies may be hit hard as these are likely to shell out handsomely on claims in such catastrophic storms.Florida was smashed in 1992 when Hurricane Andrew, a Category 5 storm, slammed insurers with $15 billion and led to the failure of more than a dozen insurers. So, one can expect how heavy the impact on insurance companies would be this time around. iShares US Insurance ETF (IAK  -  Free Report) will likely feel the brunt.However, if rates rise in the coming days, insurance companies may get some cushion. Plus, the global reinsurance industry is oversupplied with capital. As of March, it had about a $605-billion capital, thanks to fewer enormous natural disasters in the United States since 2005, as per Wall Street Journal (see all Financials ETFs here).Already, shares of property and casualty homeowners insurance companies like Universal Insurance Holdings Inc. UVE and HCI Group Inc. HCI added about 8.9% and 2.7% on Sep 8. Reinsurers XL Group Ltd (XL  -  Free Report) and Everest Re Group Ltd. (RE  -  Free Report) too added about 5.8% and 5%, respectively. This means that most of the sell-offs are overdone and priced in at the current level. Insurance companies’ shares are recouping losses.Home Retailers & Infrastructure in Sweet SpotRebuilding of homes and structures are necessary after a hurricane aftermath. Home Depot Inc. (HD  -  Free Report) and Lowe's Companies Inc. (LOW  -  Free Report) are thus in a bright spot. ETFs like Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLY  -  Free Report) and PowerShares Dynamic Building & Construction (PKB  -  Free Report) should also benefit (read: Home Retailer ETFs Set to Gain After Harvey).A Boon for Auto Sales Too?Repurchase of cars will gain traction now on higher replacing demand for the damaged vehicles.

Irma comes just weeks after Hurricane Harvey destroyed the Houston area of Texas. Hurricane Irma destroyed parts of the Caribbean on Thursday and was expected to make a landfall on the coast of Florida over the weekend. This sent insurance stocks lower on Thursday.

The House of Representatives passed the Bill on Friday, extending the debt-ceiling deadline through Dec 8, 2017. The legislation includes $15.25 billion for the relief of victims of Hurricane Harvey. The amount also provides for possible recovery efforts in case of any casualties after Hurricane Irma’s expected landfall over the weekend.On the economic data front, wholesale inventories for the month of July increased 0.6% from the previous period, whereas the consensus estimate was an increase of 0.4%.Weekly UpdateFor the week the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq declined 0.9%, 0.6% and 1.2% respectively. Reports from South Korea indicated that Pyongyang would test another missile over the weekend to celebrate their foundation day. Such news led investors to rotate out of financial stocks into bonds, leading to broad based losses. President Trump reached an agreement with key members of Congress to extend the debt ceiling deadline. This was done to aid the relief funding for victims of Hurricane Harvey. Meanwhile, Fed’s Vice Chairman announced his plans to retire in mid-October, citing ‘personal reasons’ behind his decision. Meanwhile, the ECB decided unanimously that interest rates would remain unchanged.Stocks That Made HeadlinesEquifax (EFX  -  Free Report) Tanks as Massive Data Breach News SurfacesThe brand image and creditability of Equifax Inc. (EFX  -  Free Report) is in question as very sensitive personal data of approximately 143 million consumers has been stolen from the credit information provider’s database.

971,XL,"Markets suffered losses on Thursday after investors sold off financial, consumer discretionary and telecom shares.

973,XL,"XL Group Ltd (XL  -  Free Report) and its units recently received rating action from credit rating giant, A.M. Best. The rating agency has affirmed the Long-Term Issuer Credit Ratings (Long-Term ICR) of “a+” and the existing Long-Term Issue Credit Ratings (Long-Term IR) of XL.At the same time, the rating giant affirmed the Financial Strength Rating (FSR) of B++ (Good) and the Long-Term ICR of “bbb+” of the life insurer’s affiliates.XL Group’s rating affirmation reflects its strong risk-adjusted capitalization, robust liquidity position and solid global business profile in insurance and reinsurance. This apart, the ratings indicate the life insurer’s balanced cycle management and flattering trend of operating earnings. In addition, the ratings also acknowledge the company’s expectations to achieve strong underwriting results.Moreover, the life insurer has been benefited from some of its prior buyouts. The Catlin Group Ltd. acquisition in 2015 led to wider product offerings in the market. Such positives are also represented by the aforementioned ratings affirmation.However, factors like exposure to severity events and puny underwriting results can offset the rating affirmation. Negative operating performance trends accompanied by a decline in risk adjusted capital may lead to the downside.On the other hand, modest debt and leverage, hefty operating results accompanied by sturdy risk-adjusted capitalization might lead to the positive ratings affirmation.Rating affirmations or upgrades from credit rating agencies play an important role in retaining investor confidence as well as in maintaining credit worthiness of a stock. On the other hand, rating downgrades not only damage business but also increase the cost of future debt issuances. We believe that such ratings will help XL Group retain investor confidence and write more businesses going forward.Zacks Rank and Share Price MovementCurrently, XL Group carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Shares of XL have returned 19.19% year to date, significantly outperforming the industry’s gain of 7.86%.

976,XL,"XL Group plc (XL  -  Free Report) has evaluated pre-tax catastrophe loss of $250 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. Of this, $200 million is attributable to the Reinsurance segment, which was affected by the wildfires of Northern California in October.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in the fourth quarter is currently pegged at 96 cents per share. We expect this estimate to move further south as analysts incorporate the catastrophe loss impact.Being a property and casualty insurer, XL Group could not escape the vagaries of natural disasters inducing volatility in underwriting results. Combined ratio — an indicator of underwriting profitability — deteriorated 1770 bps year over year through the first nine months of 2017.Last quarter was also bruised by the huge $1.48 billion cat loss of which, $1.33 billion stemmed from the hurricanes inducing $0.9 billion as underwriting loss.Nonetheless, XL Group has started the fourth quarter with a significant reinsurance in place including insurance catastrophe cover with a limit of $400 million and $1.9 billion of multi-year catastrophe bond protection. In total, the company just has over $3 billion of major catastrophe cover limit at its disposal and is working toward the renewal of its annual covers for 2018.Shares of XL Group have lost 6.5% quarter to date, underperforming the industry’s increase of 5.9%. The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss for 2017 being widened to $1.47 from $1.41 per share over the last 30 days. The consensus mark for 2018 earnings slipped 1.3% to $3.68 over the same time frame.  Calamities affecting underwriting results will possibly be a drag on the company’s share price.

977,XL,"XL Group Ltd (XL  -  Free Report) has been witnessing downward revisions over the last 30 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $1.41 for 2017 is worse than the loss of $1.11 per share, expected 30 days back. For 2018, it moved down by a cent over the same time frame. In fact, last quarter, XL Group failed to beat estimates.Shares of XL Group have gained 4.7% year to date, lagging the industry’s growth of 11.8% as well as the S&P 500’s 15.8% rally.The stock carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) with an unimpressive Growth Score of F. Back-tested results show that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B, when combined with a bullish Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), effectively outperform other stocks.The third quarter was bruised by the unprecedented occurrence of three major hurricanes and two Mexican tremors that wreaked havoc and hampered underwriting profitability. Wildfires in California at the onset of the fourth quarter is also estimated to weigh on underwriting results.Being a property and casualty insurer, XL Group also bore the brunt of these catastrophe events and its underwriting results have severely taken a beating.The company has been witnessing catastrophe loss over the last few quarters. In fact the company incurred underwriting loss in the first three quarters of 2017 versus profit incurred in the year-ago period. Combined ratio — indicative of the underwriting profitability — deteriorated.XL Group has also been witnessing increasing expenses, weighing on operating income expansion and thus inducing volatility to the bottom line. The company expects expenses to be about $1.77 billion in 2017.Return on equity, a measure of profitability, has been declining over the last few years. Return on equity in the first nine months was -4%, declining from 8.8% in 2014. On the other hand, leverage ratio has been deteriorating. It increased to 27.8% as of Sep 30, 2017 from 14.5% as of Dec 31, 2014.Amid all the bad news emanating from catastrophe occurrences, there is still a silver lining of hope. Insurers will now brace up for price increase that remained flat owing to a not-so-active catastrophe environment. Prudent underwriting practices should cushion underwriting results.  Also, the gradually improving interest rate environment is aiding progress in investment results for insurers, denoting a major component of the top line. The Federal Reserve has hiked rates three times since December 2016. Yet XL Group’s net investment income has decreased 3% through the first three quarters. Investment yields remained low owing to lower reinvestment rates.Nonetheless, investors are pinning hopes on December 2017 FOMC meeting for another hike. The Fed had announced intention for three rate hikes each in 2017 and 2018.Choosing the StocksThere are other attractive stocks in the property & casualty insurance industry that may not be as big a name as XL Group but promise greater returns.We have boiled down to three other stocks with potential to enhance one’s portfolio. We refine our search using the favorable Zacks Rank, northbound estimate revisions, VGM Score and growth projections.

However, decreases in North America programs and Excess & Surplus lines partially offset this upside.The reinsurance segment experienced improvement in its premiums in the reported quarter on the back of higher level of new business written and reinstatement premiums from the recent catastrophic activity.

979,XL,"The insurance industry is still reeling under the impact of Hurricane Harvey and the damages caused in the wake of the storm. But there is a whole new catastrophic disaster, waiting to strike Florida, termed as Hurricane Irma. The storm has already strengthened to Category 5 and has hit the Leeward Islands of the northeast Caribbean.It is still too early to provide an estimate of the loss to be duly incurred in the aftermath of this calamity. However, per a Barclays report, the projected impact of Hurricane Irma could possibly be the largest in U.S. history — a record, last held by Hurricane Katrina in 2005.Per the catastrophe modelers AIR Worldwide and Karen Clark and Co., the estimated losses could range between $125 million and $130 million, echoing the 1926 Miami hurricane, Great Miami.Adding to the woes is the wrath of Hurricane Harvey, still being felt by the insurance industry. An analyst from J.P. Morgan predicts its potential losses to range anywhere from $10 billion to $20 billion, thus making it one of the 10 most harmful hurricanes to hit the United States.Silver Lining in Catastrophe CloudIf we focus solely on the disadvantages caused by the occurrence of catastrophe events, it is apparent that such losses will put a dent in the underwriting results of an insurer, affecting the overall performance of an insurance company. However, the insurance industry can still fall back on such disasters to induce substantial price rise that has been flat owing to a not so active catastrophe environment.Catastrophe events like Irma and Harvey are thus a necessary evil to the insurance industry for improving their pricing as they eventually lessen competition. In the past, a not so aggressive catastrophe environment paved way to inflate the insurers’ capital reserves, resulting in loosening the underwriting standards with flexible terms and conditions to stay in business.Therefore, the insurers were rattled with intense competition and compelled to reduce prices only to attract more business. But with the advent of the aforementioned tropical storms, the insurers can now heave a sigh of relief since the scenario is likely to change in the near term.Per a report by Swiss Re, the global insured losses from disasters plummeted to $23 billion in the first half of 2017 from $36 billion in the year-ago period. Evidently, the insurance industry saw a drop in the demand for insurance claims against such catastrophe losses. Hence, lower claims from natural disasters and weather-related events have put a pressure on the pricing.We wait and see if such catastrophe losses and weather-oriented events have the capacity to diminish the already large capital reserve and bring a change to the insurance pricing cycle in the near term.Nevertheless, the industry has outperformed the broader market quarter to date, evident from a return of 1.9% compared with the S&P 500’s gain of 1.4%.Key Insurance Stocks in FocusAlthough Hurricane Irma is yet to hit Florida but it has already started showing effects in the U.S. stock market.

982,XL,"The third-quarter earnings season is gaining pace with 17.4% members of the elite S&P 500 Index having reported solid quarterly numbers so far.  The Finance sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors) has delivered a strong performance till now. About 50.7% of the sector’s market cap in the S&P 500 index that have reported results so far shows 7.8% earnings growth on 3.3% increase in revenues, both on a year-over-year basis. The beat ratio of 71.4% for the bottom line compared favorably with that of the S&P 500. However, the beat ratio of 50% for the top line is lower than the same of the S&P 500. Insurance industry, an integral part of the Finance sector, will witness soft results this yet-to-be-reported quarter. A soft performance from the insurance industry will drag the Finance sector’s third-quarter results. Per our Earnings Preview, earnings of the Finance sector will decline 1.5% though revenues will increase 1.1%.The third quarter witnessed a slew of catastrophes, which will weigh on underwriting profitability as well as the bottom line of insurers. Per the catastrophe modeler AIR Worldwide, the insured loss estimates from Irma could range between $25 billion and $35 billion and between $40 billion and $85 billion from Maria. Moody’s Analytics earlier estimated economic losses from Irma to come in the $58-$83 billion band while that from Harvey could be as high as $108 billion. Mexican tremors have all the more added to the woes.Though increasing catastrophes will induce fluctuation in underwriting results, we expect prudent underwriting practices and capital reserve piled up on a benign catastrophe environment to withstand the loss to some extent.We do not expect pricings to have been strong in the third quarter.However, net investment income, an important component of an insurer’s top line, is likely to witness improvement courtesy three rate hikes approved since December 2016. Though rate environment is improving at a very slower pace, the impact of rate increase is clearly visible in the insurer’s investment results. The third quarter will also not be an exception.Higher rates should offer some respite to life insurers, which suffered spread compression on products like fixed annuities and universal life due to continuous low rates. Annuity sales should have also benefited from higher rates. However, life insurers have considerably lowered their exposure to interest-sensitive product lines.With more than 700 companies (180 S&P 500 members) set to report their results this week, let’s find out where the following insurers stand before their release of quarterly numbers on Oct 24.Torchmark Corporation’s (TMK  -  Free Report) premiums are expected to have increased on higher Life as well as Health premiums. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for premiums reflects an increase of 3.7% year over year.Torchmark expects excess investment income to grow about 75% and between 9% and 10% on a per share basis in the second half of 2017. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for excess investment income reflects nearly 6% rise year over year.However, higher administrative expenses will likely weigh on insurance underwriting income in the quarter to be reported.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is $1.20 for the yet-to-be-reported quarter, reflecting a 4.2% year-over-year increase. Torchmark currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and combined with an Earnings ESP of +0.14% makes us confident of an earnings beat this quarter.

Nonetheless, lower operating expenses and share buybacks might offer a cushion to the bottom line.The Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at a loss of $3.74 for the yet-to-be-reported quarter compared with 44 cents earned in the year-ago quarter.  XL Group currently has a bearish Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and combined with Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult this quarter.

983,XL,"XL Group Ltd (XL  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 24, after the market closes. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 7.87%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to be Considered This QuarterWith the occurrence of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria during the third quarter as well as the Mexico earthquakes, XL Group’s underwriting profitability will be largely hampered in the soon-to-be- reported quarter. Notably, the company has estimated catastrophe losses for the third quarter to be about $1.35 billion. This in turn might lead to a noticeable deterioration in the combined ratio as well.Also, the company is expecting a fall in net investment income, owing to the still low-interest rate environment. In addition, improvement in investment income is closely associated with the credit markets and volatility in such markets can render instability in investment earnings.Further, the company might experience a decline in gross written premiums in the yet-to-be-reported quarter. This is mainly due to a large international casualty quota share treaty in the previous year, which did not get renewed, as well as a cancelled business that did not meet the company’s expectations.Nonetheless, lower operating expenses and continued share buybacks have likely cushioned the company’s bottom line. In fact, the company expects to complete not less than $700 million in buyback in 2017. Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that XL Group is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a bullish Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: XL Group has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at a loss of $3.74. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.XL Group Ltd. Price and EPS Surprise  XL Group Ltd. Price and EPS Surprise | XL Group Ltd. QuoteZacks Rank: XL Group carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which fails to increase the predictive power of ESP. Hence, we caution against all Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderSome stocks worth considering from the insurance industry with the right combination of elements to surpass estimates this quarter are as follows:CNO Financial Group, Inc. (CNO  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter earnings on Oct 25 with an Earnings ESP of +1.70% and a Zacks Rank #3.

984,XL,"AXIS Capital Holdings Ltd. (AXS  -  Free Report) has recently announced its preliminary catastrophe loss estimate of $578 million, net of tax and estimated recoveries from reinsurance and retrocessional covers including the impact of estimated reinstatement premiums for third-quarter 2017. These losses stemmed from Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria and the Mexican tremors.While the insurer expects its insurance segment to incur cat losses of $315 million, the reinsurance segment is anticipated to incur $302 million in losses.These estimates are inclusive of the loss expectations from Novae Group plc, acquired by the company on Oct 2, 2017. Axis Capital has announced Novae’s expected catastrophe loss estimates of $60 million, net of estimated recoveries from reinsurance and are inclusive of the impact of estimated reinstatement premiums.Being a property and casualty insurer, AXIS Capital is highly exposed to losses resulting from natural disasters, man-made catastrophes and other catastrophic events. Underwriting results have thus been affected for years now. For the first half of 2017, AXIS Capital incurred $76 million in catastrophe loss, narrower than the year-ago loss of $63 million. Underwriting income deteriorated 33% with 260 basis points contracting in its combined ratio.Exposure to catastrophe events has always been a concern for the company because of the uncertainty of their occurrences as well as the magnitude of their impact.  The company maintains comprehensive catastrophe reinsurance coverage for its insurance segment, comprising facultative reinsurance, property per risk treaty reinsurance and property catastrophe treaty reinsurance. However, irrespective of the techniques deployed by the company to ease off catastrophes, exposure to weather-related calamities makes its earnings volatile.Other insurers too have come up with their loss estimates. The Navigators Group, Inc. (NAVG  -  Free Report) estimates to incur catastrophe loss of $50-$70 million pre-tax ($33-$45 million after-tax) in the third quarter. XL Group Ltd. (XL  -  Free Report) estimates catastrophe losses of $1.48 billion pre-tax or $1.35 billion post-tax. The Travelers Companies, Inc. (TRV  -  Free Report) predicts pre-tax catastrophe loss from Harvey between $375 million and $750 million or $245 million and $490 million after-tax. Zacks Rank and Share Price MovementAxis Capital Holdings carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Shares of the company have massively underperformed the industry in a year’s time due to natural disasters. While the stock has gained 1.5%, the industry has registered an increase of 25.8%. Diversified product offerings and strategic acquisitions should continue to drive its shares higher.

985,XL,"The second-quarter earnings season has rolled out with 19% members of the elite S&P 500 Index reporting solid quarterly numbers so far. Per the latest Earnings Preview, the performance of 97 index members (accounting for 28.1% of index’s total market capitalization) that have already reported their financial numbers this quarter, indicate that total earnings have increased 8.4% on 5.1% higher revenues. The beat ratio is impressive with 78.4% companies surpassing the bottom-line expectations and 72.2% outperforming on the top-line front.The Finance sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors) has delivered a strong performance so far. 53.3% of the sector’s total market cap in the S&P 500 index that have reported quarterly results shows 7.2% earnings growth on 5.4% increase in revenues, both on a year-over-year basis. The beat ratio of 81.1% for the bottom line and 66.7% for the top line is higher than the beat ratio of the S&P 500.  The second quarter witnessed several catastrophe losses, which will weigh on underwriting results as well as the bottom line of insurers. Per Aon Benfield, the global reinsurance intermediary and capital advisor of Aon plc (AON  -  Free Report), catastrophe losses suffered globally is estimated at $53 billion in the first half of 2017.  Few insurers have estimated to have incurred catastrophe losses in the second quarter stemming from severe wind and hail catastrophe events occurred during April and May in the U.S.The Allstate Corp. (ALL  -  Free Report) projects $638 million in catastrophe loss while Kemper Corporation (KMPR  -  Free Report) estimates the same between $32 million and $38 million.Nonetheless, prudent underwriting standards should have helped insurers guard against a capital reserve erosion that has built up owing to a benign catastrophe environment.    Net investment income, a major component of an insurer’s top line, has witnessed improvement; albeit far lower than the historical highs. The Federal Reserve has been increasing the interest rates, reflecting their confidence in the improving economic conditions. The Fed has raised interest rate thrice in three quarters. An improving rate environment not only aided an increase in Net investment income but has also improved investment yields.Higher rates should offer some respite to life insurers that suffered spread compression on products like fixed annuities and universal life due to persistently low rates. Annuity sales too should have benefited from higher rates. Nonetheless, life insurers have considerably lowered their exposure to interest-sensitive product lines.Also, improving economy means more disposable income and better consumer sentiment. This in turn, is likely to have supported more policy writings, driving premiums higher, which contribute a lion’s share in an insurers’ top line.On the flip side, we do not expect pricings to have been strong. To write new business and retain renewals, insurers have been easing pricing, leading to soft pricing.  Commercial property, workers’ compensation and general liability were the once mostly experiencing soft pricing.Nonetheless, core business growth, geographic expansion, strategic buyouts and prudent capital deployment via share repurchase have benefited insurers.This week will see more than 800 companies reporting their quarterly results, including 183 S&P 500 members.Let’s find out how these four insurers might perform when they release their quarterly numbers on Jul 26.XL Group plc (XL  -  Free Report) is one of the world’s leading providers of insurance, reinsurance and financial risk solutions for enterprises and insurance companies. In the last reported quarter, XL Group beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8.70%. The company’s Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and an Earnings ESP of -1.12% complicate the surprise prediction.

On the Nasdaq, decliners outnumbered advancers by a 2.14-to-1 ratio. The CBOE Volatility index (VIX) increased 21% to 12.23.Geopolitical Tensions Send Shivers Down the MarketsThe CBOE Volatility index (VIX), widely regarded as the fear guage in the market, briefly jumped more than 38% to 14 on Tuesday. This was because of the escalating geopolitical tensions between North Korea and the United States. Over the weekend, North Korea tested its most powerful nuclear bomb, raising geopolitical instability in the Korean Peninsula and between Pyongyang and Washington.The latest missile test resulted in North Korea earning flak from leaders in the U.S. The U.S. Secretary of Defense, Jim Mattis warned Pyongyang that it would have to face  “a massive military response” in case of it attacked the U.S. or any of its allies such as South Korea and Japan. “We have many military options and the President wanted to be briefed on each one of them,”  said Mattis on Sunday afternoon.Moreover, South Korea’s defense ministry announced that North Korea was preparing to launch another intercontinental ballistic missile. Major General Jang Kyung-soo, the acting deputy minister for national defense policy, South Korea, said there are indications that North Korea will launch another ICBM, which they would test around Sep 9, their Foundation Day. Such statements hurt investor sentiments.Investors Rotate Out of Financials into BondsThe S&P 500 suffered its worst daily drop since Aug 17 following a nosedive in shares o financials. Eight of the S&P 500’s 11 main sectors closed lower, with financials leading the decliners. The Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLF) lost 2.10%, suffering its worst decline since May. Such a decline was the result of investors moving out of stocks that would have benefitted from tax deregulations to safer havens such as bonds. Market watchers are increasingly losing faith on Trump Administration’s ability to push through the much awaited tax reforms. Moreover, the recent rhetoric between Pyongyang and Washington also led investors to rotate out of riskier assets.The rotation from financial shares into bonds led to the yield on 10-year Treasury notes falling to 2.07%, its lowest level since Nov 9, 2016. Shares of financial companies nosedived on Tuesday. Also weighing on treasury bonds were comments fromFederal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard. According to Brainard, the Fed should slow down the momentum of interest rate hikes in the face of relatively lower inflation rates which have not hit the target of 2% over the past five years. “In that case, it would be prudent to raise the federal funds rate more gradually,” she commented.Shares of JP Morgan (JPM  -  Free Report), Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report), Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report), HSBC Holdings (HSBC  -  Free Report), Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) and Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) declined 2.4%, 3.2%, 1.7%, 1.7%, 2.1% and 3.6%. Losses for financial shares also weighed heavily on the Dow. HSBC possesses a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) whereas the other companies possess a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

This weighed on both the Dow and the S&P 500. Shares of Everest Group (RE  -  Free Report) and XL Group (XL  -  Free Report) tumbled 6.9% and 5.8% respectively. Shares of Travelers Companies (TRV  -  Free Report) also tanked 3.7%, scraping off almost 31 points from the Dow.

Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.XL Group Q2 Earnings Beat, Revenues Miss EstimatesXL Group Ltd’s second-quarter 2017 operating net income of $0.96 per share outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 7.9%. Earnings soared 159.5% year over year, primarily owing to the company’s solid performance and continued lower operating expenses.Including non-recurring items, the net income skyrocketed 660% year over year to $1.14 per share.Behind the HeadlinesTotal revenue of XL Group dipped 0.8% year over year to $2.74 billion due to lower net premiums earned.

The reported figure was significantly narrower than a loss of $240.1 million in the year-ago quarter.Total expenses of XL Group decreased 4.8% year over year to $2.5 billion owing to lower net losses and loss expenses incurred, operating expenses as well as interest expenses.With respect to Property and Casualty operations, gross premiums written in the quarter inched up 0.7% year over year to $3.6 billion.The insurance segment witnessed an improvement in premiums, primarily owing to growth in Political Risk, International Financial Lines and Global Risk Management. However, decreases in Global lines and International property and casualty lines partially offset this upside.However, the reinsurance segment experienced deterioration in its premiums in the reported quarter due to a non-recurring treaty signed in the prior-year quarter. New business in this second quarter also offset cancellations within the said segment.XL Group’s underwriting profit soared about 91% year over year to approximately $194.6 million. Combined ratio improved 370 basis points to 92.3% in the reported quarter.Financial UpdateXL Group exited the second quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $3.13 billion, down 8.6% from $3.43 billion at the end of 2016.Notes payable and debt at the end of the quarter were $3.2 billion, up 21.1% from the year-end 2016.As of Jun 30, 2017, diluted book value of XL Group was $42.15 per share, up 4.5% from Dec 31, 2016.Share Repurchase Update  In the second quarter, XL Group bought back approximately 6.0 million shares worth $250.1 million.

989,XL,"The third-quarter earnings season has begun with 26 of the S&P 500 index members having already reported their results. Only about 1% of the companies from the Finance sector have reported so far, marking 13.5% earnings growth on 14% higher revenues per our Earnings Outlook.  However, a soft performance from the insurance industry will drag the Finance sector’s third-quarter results. Per our Earnings Outlook, earnings are estimated to decline 45.1% on 0.7% lower revenues.Being integral to the insurance industry, property and casualty insurers have suffered the wrath of a slew of catastrophes. Spells of tropical storms and tremors have rocked the operational performance of non-life insurers for the third quarter. While Hurricane Harvey wreaked havoc in August, Irma and Maria devastated parts of the United States in September.  Adding to the woes, two consecutive earthquakes also hit Mexico last month.Per the catastrophe modeler AIR Worldwide, the insured loss estimates from Irma could range between $25 billion and $35 billion and between $40 billion and $85 billion from Maria. Moody’s Analytics earlier estimated economic losses from Irma come in the $58-$83 billion band while that from Harvey could be as high as $108 billion. Capital reserve, built by insurers owing to a not-so-active catastrophe environment, will help companies meet insurance claims.  Underwriting profitability of insurers will be affected by deterioration in combined ratio due to catastrophe losses incurred. This in turn will drag the companies’ bottom line.  Though increasing catastrophes will induce fluctuation in underwriting results, insurers have braced themselves with prudent underwriting practices to withstand the loss to some extent.Amid bad news, there are reasons for insurers to fall back on for cushion. Though the Fed hadn’t approved the rate hike at the last September meet, the interest rate has been nonetheless improving, albeit at a slower pace, courtesy three hikes made since December 2016. Investment income has also markedly improved from historical lows.Strategic initiatives to have a diversified portfolio, mergers and consolidation to accelerate growth and expand globally, capital influx and effective capital deployment to enhance shareholders’ value position non-life insurers on a solid base against all odds.Nevertheless, a beleaguered operating environment has shoved the industry down the ranking order to be currently placed at #242, thus representing the bottom 9% of the Zacks Industry Rank. The industry has also underperformed the S&P 500 index year to date. While the index has clocked a rally of 11.7%, the industry has gained 13.9%.Move Over the Following StocksWe picked stocks carrying a bearish Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) or #5 (Strong Sell) with an adverse VGM Score, as estimates moved downward over the last 30 days.

990,XL,"XL Group Ltd. (XL  -  Free Report) has recently announced catastrophe loss estimates of approximately $1.33 billion, emanating from Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria. Total catastrophe losses, including smaller loss events, is estimated at about $1.48 billion pre-tax or $1.35 billion post tax. These estimates are within the company’s expectations.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter has also changed to a loss of $4.23 per share against the year-ago earnings of 42 cents per share.  The estimate has been revised down over the last 30 days. The company is set to release third-quarter earnings results on Oct 24.However, our proven model cannot conclusively state if the company is likely to beat estimates this time. Thisis because XL Group’s Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which lower the predictive power of an earnings beat, when combined with a 0.00% Earnings ESP makes prediction difficult.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Nonetheless, the insurer has a track of delivering positive surprise in the last five quarter.Being a property and casualty insurer the company has been prone to suffering losses owing to catastrophe events. Catastrophe pre-tax losses net of reinsurance and reinstatement premiums for the second-quarter 2017 was $92.1 million compared with $240.1 million in the prior-year quarter. The company’s underwriting profit for the first-half 2017 was $338.6 million which grew 22.1% year over year.The P&C insurer will not be able to evade the aftermath of such catastrophe events, which in turn poses a serious threat to weigh on the company’s underwriting profitability in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. While hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria each contributed to the company’s loss estimates by 25%, 40% and 25%, respectively, 10% of such estimates is attributable to Mexican earthquakes and Typhoon Hato. The loss will however be borne equally by Insurance and Reinsurance segments.Challenged by these natural calamities, the company continues to have significant catastrophe reinsurance protections for 2017 and 2018, including catastrophe bond protections, some of which will extend through 2019.A catastrophe loss materially reduces profitability, thereby affecting the companies’ finances. Being a property and casualty insurer, XL Group will not escape the disaster caused by such catastrophe events. However, banking on its strong capital position and  expert team,the company remains well positioned in addressing the challenges or risks faced by its clients and brokers.Share Price MovementShares of the company have underperformed the industry year to date. While the stock has gained 9.6%, the industry has rallied 12.3%. We expect its diversified product offerings fueling higher premiums to drive the stock higher in the future. Other Cat Loss EstimatesOther insurers too have come up with their loss estimates. The Navigators Group, Inc (NAVG  -  Free Report) anticipates incurring pre-tax catastrophe loss of $50-$70 million ($33-$45 million after tax) in the third quarter. W.R. Berkley Corporation (WRB  -  Free Report) has recently projected a catastrophe loss of about $110 million, which translates to $72 million after tax. Assurant Inc. (AIZ  -  Free Report) has estimated between $134 million and $140 million pretax of reportable catastrophe losses from Harvey and expects gross losses from Irma to exceed its retention of $125 million pretax.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

992,XL,"In the insurance industry, the property and casualty insurers are the major beneficiaries of an improving rate environment. The interest rate environment has been slowly on the better end with Fed (Federal Reserve) raising interest rates thrice in three consecutive quarters (0.25% in December 2016, 1% in March 2017 and 1.25% in June 2017). This reflects Fed’s confidence in the improving U.S. economy.The Fed had earlier indicated of three interest rate hikes in 2017, of which, two have already been made by the first half of 2017. An increased rate is expected to positively impact the net investment income, a major component of an insurer’s top line. A broader invested asset base and alternative asset classes are other positives.Underwriting results, the major indicator of profitability for any insurer, will remain volatile owing to occurrence of catastrophes. Per Aon Benfield, the global reinsurance intermediary and capital advisor of Aon plc (AON  -  Free Report), the estimated amount of global catastrophe losses is $53 billion in the first half of 2017, the highest since 2011. Underwriting results will thus suffer as catastrophes are on the rise.Nonetheless, improving economy indicating more disposable income and better consumer sentiment should support more policy writings, thus driving the premiums higher. Influx of capital, building of reserves and containment of underwriting expenses also pave the way for growth prospects.Though the Property and Casualty Insurance industry is currently ranked at #203 (lies at the bottom one-third of the Zacks Industry Rank for 252 plus industries), it has outperformed the S&P 500 in a year by registering a rally of 19.3%. The index on the other hand climbed 10.9%.Here we focus on two property and casualty insurers. Everest Re Group Ltd. (RE  -  Free Report) writes property and casualty, reinsurance and insurance in the United States, Bermuda and international markets, while XL Group Ltd (XL  -  Free Report) is a leading global provider of insurance, reinsurance and financial risk solutions for enterprises and insurance companies. While Everest Re has a market capitalization of $10.8 billion, XL Group has $11.3 billion of the same.Both stocks carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). It will be interesting to note which stock is better positioned in terms of fundamentals.A better-ranked stock from the same industry is Markel Corporation (MKL  -  Free Report), flaunting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1Rank stocks here.Price PerformanceBoth Everest Re and XL Group have outpaced the industry with shares surging 39.4% and 30.3%, respectively. Here, Everest Re emerges a clear winner.ValuationThe price to book value metric is the best multiple, used for valuing insurers. Compared with Property and Casualty Industry’s P/B ratio of 1.47, Everest Re is underpriced with a reading of 1.26. Meanwhile, XL Group is much cheaper with a trailing 12-month P/B multiple of 0.86. This round goes to XL Group as the company’s shares are cheaper than Everest Re’s.Debt-to-EquityBoth XL Group and Everest Re have lower debt-to-equity versus the industry average of 33.31%. Everest Re with a leverage ratio of 7.38 has an edge over XL Group with the same of 24.48.Return on EquityEverest Re’s return on equity of 13.60% outpaced the industry average of 6.18%. However, XL Group’s return on equity of 4.88% underperformed the industry. Everest Re thus wins this round.Dividend YieldIn a year’s period, Everest Re’s dividend yield was 1.91%, while XL Group’s was 2.01%.  Both have a dividend yield that outshines the industry’s average of 0.49%.  Comparatively, XL Group has an edge over Everest Re.Earnings Surprise HistoryRegarding the companies’ surprise history, XL Group has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last four quarters with an average beat of 14.89%. Whereas, Everest Re delivered positive surprises in the last four quarters with a four-quarter average beat of 46.59%.Everest Re has an edge over XL Group.Earnings Estimate Revisions and Growth ProjectionsXL Group’s 2017 estimates have inched up 1.9% but slid 2.9% for 2018 in the last 30 days.  On the other hand, Everest Re’s 2017 estimates have moved up 2.6% and 1.3% for 2018 over the same time frame.For XL Group, The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share is $3.25 for 2017, reflecting a year-over-year surge of 99.08%. For 2018, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share is pegged at $3.97, representing a year-over-year rise of 22.39%. XL Group has long-term expected earnings per share growth of 9.0%.For Everest Re, The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share is $21.42 for 2017, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 9.3%. For 2018, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share is pegged at $20.23, representing a year-over-year decrease of 5.6%. Everest Re has long-term expected earnings per share growth of 10.0%.This round therefore goes equally to both the companies.To ConcludeEverest Re holds an edge over XL Group on price performance, leverage, return on equity and the earnings surprise history.  Considering parameters like valuation and dividend yield, XL Group seems better poised than Everest Re. However, based on our comparative analysis, Everest Re presently has an advantage over XL Group.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.
