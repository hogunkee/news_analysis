For more analysis on Apple, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.Meanwhile, Wall Street analysts offered positive and negative data points about the health of Apple's business on Thursday.KeyBanc Capital Markets said iPhone inventories are piling up in the U.S., despite generous promotions by wireless carriers.""Despite generous promotions at carriers, we observed a significant spike in iPhone days of inventory,"" KeyBanc analyst John Vinh said in a report Wednesday. ""On an absolute level, inventories are significantly higher than what we observed last year with the iPhone 7.""The main reason why sales of Apple's iPhone X have disappointed appears to be its high price, he said. The flagship handset starts at $999.In January, AT&T (T) extended its buy-one-get-one-free promotion to the iPhone X. It is now offering customers a $1,000 credit on the purchase of a second phone with the purchase of an iPhone X. Verizon (VZ) and T-Mobile (TMUS) are offering $700 off toward the second phone purchase if adding another line, he said.""Historically, we note carriers generally introduce promotional activity, as we've seen here, as a tool to manage excess inventory, typically in response to disappointing demand,"" Vinh said.Investment bank Morgan Stanley said Apple made smartphone market-share gains in China during the fourth quarter.Apple iPhone shipments rose 12% in China last quarter while Android smartphone shipments declined 17%, Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty said in a report Thursday. She noted that iPhone X share gains accelerated from the fourth quarter into the current quarter.She reiterated her overweight rating on Apple stock with a price target of 203.As the smartphone market matures, Apple is likely to see a growing percentage of its business coming from selling accessories and additional devices to its installed base of ""loyal, high-value customers,"" Guggenheim Securities analyst Robert Cihra said in a report Wednesday.Apple's effort to get more sales from its installed base is now showing up in the rapid growth of its services businesses, Cihra said. He thinks the company's catchall line-item ""Other Products"" could be next to see big growth, potentially doubling from $11 billion in calendar 2016 to $22 billion in 2019. The Other Products category includes the Apple Watch, HomePod smart speaker, Apple TV set-top box, Beats headphones, AirPods wireless earbuds and other accessories.Other Products could become Apple's fourth-largest business in calendar 2018, surpassing the iPad tablet business, he said.He estimates Other Products will generate more than $19 billion, or over 7% of total revenue, in 2018 and will be Apple's fastest-growing segment at 34% growth year over year.Apple's iPhone business is expected to account for 63% of revenue this year, followed by services at 13% and Mac computers at 9%, he said. Apple's iPad business is likely to be less than 7% of revenue this year, he said.RELATED:Apple Entering Post-Supercycle Era, But iPhone Installed Base Still Growing

3,MAC,"Unibail-Rodamco SE, Europe's largest commercial landlord, agreed to buy Australia's Westfield Corp. for about A$21 billion ($15.8 billion) in the biggest property acquisition since 2013 as declining store sales push mall operators worldwide to merge.X The Paris-based company offered a combination of cash and stock that values Westfield at A$10.01 per share, or about 18% more than Monday's closing price, according to a statement Tuesday. The offer has been unanimously recommended by the board of Westfield, the biggest private sector mall landlord in London and the 12th largest U.S. retail property owner.""Our first take is that we are not overexcited about the price — Unibail is buying at an implied initial yield of below 4%,"" said Peter Papadakos, an analyst at Green Street Advisors in London. ""If you think about where cap rates and yields are going in the U.S. and the U.K., which we think will be stable to upwards, the pricing is aggressive.""Unibail is mounting the biggest takeover of a company in the Asia-Pacific region this year — and the largest ever in Australia — as mall owners seek to contend with relentless pressure from online commerce. Shares of such companies have been hit hard and store closures are accelerating, pressuring landlords to fill empty space and reinvent shopping centers. Unibail-Rodamco's fell as much as 4.1%, the most since October 2016, after the deal was announced.Founded by billionaire Frank Lowy, Westfield began in 1959 with one shopping mall in the outer suburbs of Sydney and has grown to become one of the world's largest shopping center owners and managers. Westfield owns and operates 35 malls in the U.S. and U.K. valued at $32 billion, according to its website.""The U.S. is probably not the market where you'd try to sell"" lower quality malls ""at this point,"" Unibail-Rodamco Chief Financial Officer Jaap Tonckens said in an interview with Bloomberg Television. ""I think we'll focus on improving them, ride out the storm and see where we go from there."" The deal should be accretive to earnings from the first full year, he said.Westfield's properties include shopping malls in east and west London and the retail space in New York's World Trade Center. It gets almost 70% of its $1.8 billion annual revenue in the U.S., where companies are trying to re-purpose struggling brick-and-mortar shopping centers.""This is a combination of two of the best-in-class mall operators in the world,"" Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Sue Munden said. ""They will become a dominant player, have the best relationships with retailers and therefore be best placed to create the malls of the future.""The latest transaction is the largest in real estate since Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. sold an apartment owner to a consortium led by Equity Residential for more than $16 billion, a deal that was completed in 2013.The transaction implies an enterprise value of $24.7 billion, according to the statement. Unibail offered 0.01844 of its shares plus $2.67 in cash for each Westfield security, representing 65% stock to 35% cash, according to the statement.Unibail-Rodamco has been selling smaller and less-dominant assets in its European retail portfolio and reinvesting the proceeds in its development pipeline which includes larger malls which are expected to be more resilient to the growth of online shopping. The company has 8.1 billion euros ($9.5 billion) of planned projects, according to its website.The landlord will continue with a plan announced earlier to sell 3 billion euros of malls that are noncore, Tonckens said in the interview.Shares of Westfield have declined 9.4% this year, headed for their worst performance since 2011. The shares were suspended Tuesday ahead of the announcement.""Assets I've spent my life building, I could not imagine a better home for them than in this new company,"" Frank Lowy said via a webcast from London. Lowy will chair a newly created advisory board, and the family will maintain a substantial investment in the group, according to the statement.In other signs of consolidation in the industry, Brookfield Asset Management (BAM) is seeking to buy the portion of mall owner GGP (GGP) it doesn't already own. New York-based hedge fund Third Point is pushing for change at Macerich (MAC), including a possible sale, after building a stake in the real estate investment trust, people familiar with the matter said last month. Even after getting a boost from Brookfield's interest, GGP shares are down 6.4% since the beginning of the year.The deal will lead to speculation that Simon Property Group Inc., the biggest U.S. mall owner, will also look to expand, Munden said. The firm, which has seen its shares fall 8.7% this year, owns about one-fifth of Klepierre SA, the Paris-based shopping center owner that's been renovating its properties.The U.K.'s biggest publicly traded mall owners are also combining forces. Hammerson Plc this month agreed to buy its smaller competitor, Intu Properties Plc, in a deal that values the latter at about 3.4 billion pounds ($4.6 billion).""We're going into London, we believe it's a global city and will be fine"" despite the slowing U.K. economy, Tonckens said. ""Will it be choppy? Probably.""

6,MAC,"Chicago is in the throes of a New York-circa-1970s-style fiscal crisis. Abetted by Illinois' government, the Windy City is adopting one of the borrowing tools that helped New York get its finances in order: a complex municipal bond, structured to protect investors in a possible bankruptcy.But unlike New York, Chicago and Illinois are using this invention to delay reform.No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth PerspectiveChicago has spent two decades digging itself into a hole. Back in 2000, the city had racked up $12.3 billion in debt, in current dollars; now, it owes $20.2 billion. Back then, the debt burden per person was roughly $4,400; these days, it's $7,500.Even scarier is what Chicago owes to pensioners: $31.5 billion, up from $5 billion in 2000. Last year, Chicago's pension funds took in $900 million from the city and its employees and earned nearly $541 million in investment income, but the fund paid out more than $2 billion.Chicago has less money set aside in its pension funds today than it did a decade and a half ago.X Chicago has zero hope of fixing this mess if it keeps to its current path. Since 2000, it has run a surplus once (in 2002).Illinois and Chicago did try to reform the city's pension plans in 2014. But the Illinois Supreme Court struck down the changes, observing that, though ""fiscal soundness is important,"" the state and city could ""not utilize an unconstitutional method"" — impairing benefits that the state constitution protected — ""to achieve that end.""You would think bondholders would worry. Yet last February, they lent Chicago a fresh $1.2 billion, despite warnings in bond documents that ""the retirement funds have significant unfunded liabilities and low funding ratios"" and despite the city holding a junk rating.Customers were willing to buy the bond, maturing in 2029, at about 6% annual interest — above the 3% rate that New York could borrow, but not sufficient to deter Chicago.Chicago worries that interest rates will rise even higher. The credit cutoff would serve as a powerful signal. Chicago keeps telling retirees and workers, including recent hires, that it can pay pensions that it can't afford.The city won't stop doing that — until it is forced to.Rather than heed the marketplace's muted alarm, Chicago and Illinois are trying to turn the alarm off. In August, to maintain the city's ability to borrow cheaply, Illinois passed a law allowing Chicago to issue debt under a more complex structure than ""general obligation"" bonds.Some background: A healthy city borrows to build or to maintain infrastructure. It typically has two ways to give investors confidence that it will repay that debt.First is a ""revenue bond,"" backed by specific user revenues. If a city builds a water-treatment plant, residents and businesses pay a fee for the water, and investors can count on that money to repay the debt.Second, in cases where infrastructure doesn't pay for itself — local roads — the city will borrow under a ""general obligation"" and pledge its ""full faith and credit"" to repay the bond. The implication is that the city will raise taxes or slash spending, or both, if other repayment efforts fail.When investors no longer believe in that ""full faith and credit,"" a city can borrow money through a third method, pioneered by New York during the 1970s crisis. Saddled by social-welfare obligations, New York could no longer repay its debts, yet it needed to borrow more to provide services while it figured out its budget mess.New York's financial industry solved this problem by inventing a hybrid bond that combined the strongest features of revenue and general-obligation bonds.The state would set up a nonprofit entity, known as a ""Municipal Assistance Corporation."" MAC, as people called it, would borrow the money — and give it to the city.To repay the debt, MAC would first collect the city's sales taxes from the state, use those revenues to pay its debt obligations, and only then deliver any leftover money to the city.The sales taxes, in other words, were ""securitized"" — pledged to protect a certain kind of debt. The new instrument comforted bondholders. They no longer trusted New York City to pay back its own borrowing.But they felt that they could depend on the new state-chartered corporation to collect the city's money to pay the debt.The structure, in legal terms, was ""bankruptcy remote."" New York could file for insolvency — as was then a risk — but the sales taxes would continue to repay the special MAC debt, even in such a bankruptcy.Ratings agencies approved the new financial instrument, awarding it ""A"" ratings even as they suspended the city's ratings in the face of default.The ability to borrow through a safer instrument can buy a distressed municipality time to reduce its spending or raise taxes, or both, in an orderly fashion. After its 2013 bankruptcy, Detroit turned to a MAC-style mechanism.State governments can also use the power that the mechanism affords to oversee local finances, whether through bankruptcy, as in Detroit, or outside of it, as in New York.Yet the potential for irresponsibility is evident in Chicago. Thanks to the new Illinois law, Chicago is following New York's 1970s lead, creating a MAC-like organization to issue bonds this fall. Like Gotham, Chicago is securitizing the bonds with sales-tax revenues.The state will pay the interest on the new debt before sending the remaining funds to Chicago, so as ""to achieve higher credit ratings and reduce debt-service costs,"" noted The Bond Buyer. ""The program is designed to bypass the city's weak bond ratings by insulating the bonds and assigned revenues from the risk of being dragged into bankruptcy.""The bond structure will mark the second time in a year that Chicago has issued structured debt. Last winter, Chicago's school district — a legally separate municipality, despite the same tax base — issued a half a billion dollars in bonds through a new instrument designed, as Reuters put it, ""to separate the debt from the district's severe financial woes and protect it in a potential bankruptcy.""Yet this mechanism works in the long term only if fiscal reforms accompany it. New York state let New York City issue MAC bonds only if it acceded to a state takeover of its finances. Gotham had to pare spending and hike taxes — and then the city struck luck in the early 1980s, when Wall Street took off.Chicago, by contrast, will continue to manage its own finances. Further, the city faces a more severe long-term financial outlook. Seventies-era New York experienced a liquidity crisis, which could be solved with higher revenues and a temporary reduction in services.Chicago is looking at a solvency crisis: Even with tax increases and service cuts (both of which could drive away residents), the city is unlikely to make good on its pension commitments. Illinois, with its own credit rating hovering just above junk and with pension problems in other municipalities, is in a weaker position to help than New York state was.It's not clear that this bankruptcy-remote structure would protect against losses if Chicago defaults on its general-obligation bonds, anyway. True, New York's bond structure worked; investors were repaid.But these bonds worked less because of their airtight design than because New York is in a solid fiscal position. Elsewhere, municipal borrowers that issued similar bonds aren't faring so well.Take Puerto Rico, before Hurricane Maria hit. In 2007, it owed 70.2% of GNP, and the government had shut down the previous year in a battle over a nearly billion-dollar deficit.Officials approved the territory's first-ever sales tax, but Puerto Rico didn't trim its budget. Instead, it issued $1.3 billion in new bonds, backed by the sales tax, via a MAC-style outfit, Cofina.The government warned investors that the borrowing was not backed ""by the full faith, credit and taxing power of the commonwealth"" — but it reassured them, too, that it would collect more than enough from the sales tax to cover payments. Investors bought the bonds later that year at below 6% interest.Investors comfortable with Cofina made it possible for Puerto Rico to raise $17 billion, almost as much as it owed in general-obligation bonds. By 2012, the territory owed nearly 100% of its GNP — and its economy was in trouble. Five years later, it would be bankrupt.Cofina's structure failed to help Puerto Rico establish financial stability, and it failed to protect investors too — the territory defaulted not only on its general-obligation bonds but also on Cofina debt.It may be years before Cofina bondholders know whether they will do better or worse than general-obligation investors.Cities and states have an incentive to favor holders of general-obligation bonds. An entity like the one that Chicago has created to issue sales-tax-backed debt has no purpose but to issue such bonds. Like a corporation, it could default and vanish. Chicago, by contrast, will stick around. The city would want to maintain its ability to issue debt after any bankruptcy.MAC-style securitized debt for municipalities is a good idea if it helps them avoid radical cutbacks — shutting off streetlights at night — in favor of gradual change.It's not a good idea when it delays change. In devising legal structures to protect bondholders from a crisis, Chicago may make its crisis worse.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

7,MAC,"The Pentagon and the welfare state have been locked in brutal combat for decades, and the Pentagon has gotten clobbered. Protecting the country was once the first obligation of government. No more. Welfare programs — Social Security, Medicare, food stamps and other benefits — dwarf defense spending. As a result, we have become more vulnerable.Here is the assessment of Mackenzie Eaglen, a defense specialist at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute:""The United States now fields a military that could not meet even the requirements of a benign Clinton-era world. The services have watched their relative overmatch and capacity decline in almost every domain of warfare ... for nearly two decades. As rival nation-states have accelerated their force development, the Department of Defense has stalled out, creating a dangerous window of relative military advantage for potential foes. ... While the United States continues to field the best military personnel in the world, policy makers have asked them to do too much with too little for too long.""Politically, the vaunted military-industrial complex has been no match for the welfare state's personal handouts. There has been a historic transformation. In the 1950s and 1960s, defense spending often accounted for half of the federal budget and equaled 8 to 10% of gross domestic product (the economy). In 2016, defense spending was 3% of GDP and 15% of the federal budget, according to the Office of Management and Budget. Meanwhile, welfare programs — called ""human resources"" by the OMB — accounted for 15% of GDP and 73% of federal spending.No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth Perspective(A note for policy wonks: Some military spending occurs outside the Defense Department, but including this spending would not much change trends or conclusions.)There are many telltale signs that defense spending, though now exceeding $600 billion annually, is being squeezed. A new study by Todd Harrison and Seamus Daniels of the Center for Strategic & International Studies reports the following:Sizable increases in defense spending seem warranted to compensate for past underfunding and to confront new challenges. China and Russia loom as potential adversaries; North Korea could become a global menace; the Middle East remains a cauldron of conflict; global terrorism survives; and new forms of warfare — cyberattacks, drones and space-based conflict — demand new responses.Proposals abound. The plan of AEI's Eaglen would, among other things, increase the Army's number of active-duty soldiers from 476,000 to 519,000; raise the number of Navy ships from 275 to 339 by 2025; expand the Air Force's inventory of planes to 6,391 by 2022, up from 5,465; and accelerate research and procurement.Sen. John McCain and Rep. Mac Thornberry — the chairmen of the Senate and House Armed Services Committees — have endorsed a similar proposal. So has the Trump administration, though with less detail. The problem is not policy; it's politics.Eaglen's plan would cost $672 billion more than existing law over the next five years. Will Congress vote to spend that money? If so, will it be financed through higher taxes (seems dubious, given Republicans' misplaced zest for tax cuts); reductions in other government programs (also dubious — if cuts were popular, they'd already have been adopted); or borrowing (the easiest alternative, but embarrassing)? Present congressional budget negotiations for FY 2018 focus on a smaller increase in defense outlays.Defense spending is increasingly a political orphan. Republicans are wedded to tax cuts. Democrats are addicted to welfare spending, mislabeled as ""entitlements.""What these political preferences share in common is that they provide immediate political gratification for large constituencies: lower taxes or higher benefits. By contrast, defense spending confers smaller benefits on smaller constituencies, mainly workers at military bases and government contractors.In the competition for scarce public funds, the military-industrial complex is at a distinct disadvantage with the welfare state, an essential and permanent part of our social fabric. No one is going to dismantle it. But the favoritism toward the welfare state weakens the military. It is time to recognize and rectify this bias because it poses a fundamental threat to our collective well-being.More Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

8,MAC,"When players took a knee or raised a defiant fist during the NFL's pregame national anthems, they were simply acts of protest, we were told. Yet a person could honestly conclude that it was part of a plan to extort the league.The protests were started last year by former San Francisco 49er quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who knelt, he said, to draw attention to the oppression of black people and ""people getting paid leave and getting away with murder,"" presumably an allegation that white police officers were killing innocent black men in a wave of slayings.No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth PerspectiveKaepernick's protest, though, was short on facts, according to Heather Mac Donald of the Manhattan Institute. She said ""large-scale oppression of blacks by the police or society as a whole is just false,"" and backed it up with data.""The facts are these,"" she wrote in September 2016 in the Washington Examiner. ""Last year, the police shot 990 people, the vast majority armed or violently resisting arrest, according to the Washington Post's database of fatal police shootings.

That proportion of black victims is lower than what the black violent crime rate would predict.""XLater in the month, Mac Donald, using FBI statistics, wrote in the Manhattan Institute's City Journal blog that ""contrary to the Black Lives Matter narrative, the police have much more to fear from black males than black males have to fear from the police. In 2015, a police officer was 18.5 times more likely to be killed by a black male than an unarmed black male was to be killed by a police officer.""No matter. Others joined Kaerpenick and have continued to grandstand on the sidelines with the petulant and impotent-by-NFL-standards quarterback is no longer in the league. They have done a fine job of dividing a nation and creating racial tension that had been inflamed over eight years by President Obama.One of the players who kept up the practice, Malcolm Jenkins, a safety for the Philadelphia Eagles who has raised a fist during the anthem since the second week of the 2016 season, explained that his actions were an effort ""to draw awareness to injustices in this country, disenfranchised people of color.""But now Malcolm apparently feels he's done enough. He said last week that he will no longer protest before games. Is this because he's convinced that the ""injustices"" have been corrected? No.Malcolm's decision was made after the NFL pledged to contribute $89 million over seven years to social justice causes. To his credit, though, he kept his end of the deal, standing Sunday night during the national anthem without a raised fist.While Jenkins said in an open letter that ""it was never about the money or having our voices bought,"" the entire drama has the odor of a Jesse Jackson shakedown. For years, Jackson reportedly threatened corporations with protests, boycotts, and malicious accusations of racism unless the corporations made donations to groups Jackson supported.A Judicial Watch report from 2006 said ""Jackson had been exposed … as an extortionist who uses his influence as a civil rights leader to essentially blackmail wealthy corporations with absurd discrimination threats.""The NFL had a chance to avoid this and save itself a lot of trouble (and money). It could have simply suspended any player who refused to stand for the national anthem, as the NBA did in 1996 when Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf wouldn't stand.They suspended him without pay, which cost him about $32,000 a game, which quickly brought a resolution — rather than forfeit the money, Abdul-Rauf, born Chris Jackson in Gulfport, Miss., and raised a Baptist, complied with league rules.The NFL could have even changed its policy and required players to remain in their locker rooms or in stadium tunnels while the anthem was being played. That would both deny the protesting players a stage and give paying customers a break from a disrespectful display that offended them.Instead, the NFL gave in to political correctness and ran away in fear of being called a racist organization, a label easily handed out in our overheated social and political environment to anyone who doesn't fully buy into the social justice warrior mob mentality. It's learning a painful lesson: Weakness and a lack of principle are always costly.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

11,MAC,"Every quarter, Apple (AAPL) discloses how many units it sold of iPhone, iPad and Mac computers, but it doesn't reveal how many Apple Watch smartwatches it sells. That's been the case since the wearable device debuted in April 2015.XSo, for the past 10 quarters, Wall Street analysts have had to estimate Apple Watch sales by parsing data from Apple's ""other products"" line item and other sources. Apple's ""other products"" category includes sales of Apple Watch as well as Beats headphones, AirPods wireless earbuds, Apple TV set-top boxes, iPod Touch media players and Apple-branded and third-party accessories.After Apple released results for its fiscal fourth quarter ended Sept. 30 late Thursday, at least nine Wall Street analysts tried to guesstimate how many smartwatches the company sold during the period.Based on the average of those nine estimates, Apple is believed to have sold 3.6 million Apple Watches in the September quarter.At the low end of estimates were Needham and Oppenheimer, which each estimated that Apple sold 3 million smartwatches last quarter. On the high end was GBH Insights, which estimated Apple sold 5 million Apple Watches in the period.Consensus estimates for the current holiday quarter have Apple selling 6.89 million watches. Analysts on average think Apple will sell 14.3 million watches this year and 18.4 million in 2018.On a conference call with analysts Thursday, Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said Apple Watch unit sales grew over 50% for the third consecutive quarter in the fiscal fourth quarter.IBD'S TAKE: Apple stock broke out of a cup-with-handle base at a buy point of 160.97 on Oct. 27. For more analysis on Apple stock, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.""It continues to be the best selling and most loved smartwatch in the world,"" Cook said. ""We began shipping Apple Watch Series 3 just six weeks ago and customers love the new freedom of cellular. The ability to go for a run with just your Apple Watch or go for a quick errand without your phone while staying connected is a game changer.""He described the Apple Watch as ""the ultimate device for a healthy life.""The Apple Watch competes with devices from Fitbit (FIT), Garmin (GRMN), Samsung and others.Although Apple Watch is a small part of Apple's total sales, it is an important product for the company, GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives said in a note Friday.""While Watch still represents less than 5% of overall sales, we believe this is a very important product category that is a 'gate opener' product for other consumer wearables (e.g. AR glasses, etc.) down the road,"" Ives said.Apple shares rose 1% to close at 174.25 on the stock market today.RELATED:Apple Gives Rare Bullish Outlook As iPhone X Hits Stores; Stock At RecordGoPro, Fitbit Tumble After Earnings Reports; Zagg Jumps

Its previous record high was 156.65, reached on May 19. Apple stock had formed a flat base with a buy point of 156.75 over the past 12 weeks.During a conference call with analysts, Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook gave tantalizing clues about what's coming from Apple in the fields of augmented reality and automation.Apple earned $1.67 a share, up 18% year over year, on sales of $45.4 billion, up 7%, in the quarter ended July 1. Analysts expected $1.57 and $44.89 billion for the company's fiscal third quarter.For Apple's fiscal fourth quarter ending in September, the company expects sales to rise nearly 8% year over year to $50.5 billion, based on the midpoint of its guidance. Apple did not give an earnings-per-share target. Wall Street was modeling for Apple to earn $1.81 a share on sales of $49.21 billion.IBD'S TAKE: Apple stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 74, meaning it has outperformed 74% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months. For more information on Apple, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.Apple's iPhone sales accounted for 54.7% of total revenue in the third quarter, making it by far the company's largest business. IPhone sales totaled 41 million, in line with expectations and easing fears the devices might not have met that number due to lower demand ahead of the iPhone 8 launch.Services were Apple's second largest business in the third quarter, generating $7.3 billion in sales, or 16% of total revenue. Services include iTunes, App Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay, iCloud and other offerings.Apple's Mac computer business was its third largest at 12.3% of revenue, followed by iPad tablets at 10.9%. The rest of sales came from ""other products,"" such as the Apple Watch, AirPods, Beats headphones and other devices.Apple ended the June quarter with $261.5 billion in cash and marketable securities, with 94% of the total located outside the U.S.Cook gushed about the potential for augmented reality and Apple's effort to spur the market with its AR Kit for software developers. Apple introduced AR Kit at its Worldwide Developers Conference in June.""I could not be more excited about AR and what we're seeing with AR Kit in the early going,"" Cook said. He sees uses for augmented reality spanning consumer, small business and enterprise apps.""I think AR is big and profound, and this is one of those huge things that we'll look back at and marvel on the start of it,"" Cook said. ""With hundreds of millions of people actively using iPhone and iPad today, iOS will become the world's biggest augmented reality platform as soon as iOS 11 ships"" this fall.Augmented reality overlays digital information on to a user's field of view using either mobile device displays or special glasses.""We think AR Kit will help the most creative minds in the industry tap into the latest computer vision technologies to build engaging content,"" Cook said. ""AR has broad mainstream applicability across education, entertainment, interactive gaming, enterprise, and categories we probably even haven't thought of.""Cook might have been hinting about possible AR products like smartglasses, Rosenblatt Securities analyst Jun Zhang said in a report Wednesday.""Tim's comments on AR suggest Apple might work on some AR device in addition to (the) 3D sensing module for the iPhone 8,"" Zhang said. ""We think the 3D sensing opportunity might be bigger than we have been expecting in 2018.""Cook also suggested that Apple's interest in artificial intelligence technology goes beyond self-driving cars.""In terms of autonomous systems, what we've said is that we are very focused on autonomous systems from a core technology point of view,"" Cook said. ""We do have a large project going and are making a big investment in this. From our point of view, autonomy is the mother of all AI projects. And autonomous systems can be used in a variety of ways, and a vehicle is only one. But there are many different areas of it, and I don't want to go any further with that.""Cook dodged a question about President Trump's claim that Apple planned to build three large factories in the U.S. Instead Cook focused on Apple's efforts to create jobs in the U.S. through support for app developers, U.S. manufacturers, and its own employee base.In a July 25 interview with the Wall Street Journal, Trump said Cook told him that Apple planned to open ""three big, beautiful plants"" in the U.S.

18,MAC,"XSome people who have only a cursory understanding of IBD's investing approach will argue that it's a short-term trading strategy. That's wrong on two levels.First, IBD isn't about imposing a strategy on the market; it's about letting the market impose its reality on you.Second, the ideal of IBD investing isn't short-term. The ideal is to latch onto a truly big winner and stay with it as long as possible.There will be many stocks that initially appear to meet the ideal standard for greatness but ultimately either disappoint or become a one-time profit.However, when a stock does prove its greatness, it's important that the investor stay in it.IBD chairman and founder William J. O'Neil has written about Pic 'N' Save, a company that later changed its name to Mac Frugal's Bargains and was bought by Big Lots (BIG) in 1998.O'Neil held Pic 'N' Save for seven and a half years. ""All told, we bought Pic 'N' Save on 285 different days. ... Our early purchases showed more than a 10-fold gain,"" O'Neil wrote in ""How to Make Money in Stocks.""The tough part is identifying which stocks will turn into long-term winners.There's a rule that can help you identify and stay in such stocks. It's the eight-week hold rule.If a stock with elite fundamentals breaks out of a base and rises 20% in the first two or three weeks, that stock should be held for eight weeks and then re-evaluated.Often, the big winners begin with such a move.Pic 'N' Save completed a cup-with-handle base in August 1979. The stock cleared the 13.35 buy point (1) in mid-August and advanced almost 22% in less than three weeks (2).This triggered the eight-week-hold rule.After eight weeks, the stock was back at the 10-week line but still comfortably above the entry. The stock established a low at 14 over the next two weeks. This proved to be the toughest time to hold.Had anyone panicked and sold, they could've bought the stock back in mid-November when it retook its 10-week line in strong trade (3).In the next four years, Pic 'N' Save rose 10-fold. It peaked in mid-1986, marking a 20-fold gain from August 1979.(This column originally published in the Oct. 30, 2012, edition of IBD.)RELATED:When To Sell Stocks: Take Action When The Industry Leaders CrumbleWhen To Sell Stocks: How A Weakening Relative Strength Line Raises A Red FlagHow To Spot Major Market Tops: Here's The Easy Way

20,MAC,"Known retail disruptor Amazon.com (AMZN) is at it again, reportedly.WWD said Wednesday, citing market sources, that online cosmetics-retailer Violet Grey could partner with Amazon to sell its luxury brands through the e-commerce behemoth.Violet Grey was founded in 2013 by Cassandra Grey, the wife of late ex-Paramount Pictures CEO Brad Grey. The company has a brick-and-mortar presence on Melrose Place in Los Angeles, offering ""expertly curated beauty products and exclusive offerings, all tested and approved by Hollywood's leading hairstylists, skin care experts, and makeup artists.""X Its e-commerce site features photo shoots with celebrities such as ""Game of Thrones"" star Emilia Clarke and stories like ""Lessons on Hair Volume"" and ""Violette's Rules of Foundation.""Why does it matter? The news of Violet Grey's potential deal with Amazon is likely what's weighing on specialty retailer Ulta Beauty (ULTA) in the stock market today. Ulta fell 3.65% to 247.24, hitting a fresh 2017 low intraday as shares continue their downward trajectory from early June.Stifel analyst Mark Astrachan, who wrote that he was ""unsurprised"" by the report, called a potential Amazon-Violet Grey deal a ""negative for retailers, including Ulta and Sephora, and to (a) lesser extent department stores, which rely on beauty to drive foot traffic.""Macy's (M), Kohl's (KSS) and peers certainly have their own troubles, and a recent Wall Street Journal report — on department stores discounting prestige beauty products — sent Macy's shares to a seven-year low. J.C. Penney (JCP) has seen beauty sales grow, thanks to its Sephora shop-in-shops.One small online beauty retailer getting the backing of Amazon doesn't pose an imminent threat to cosmetics stores or retailers that carry makeup and skin care. The worry, though, is what it indicates about Amazon's interest in entering the space — and how hard the e-commerce heavy will pummel away once it has something in its cross hairs.Grocery stores, after all, could tell its counterparts in beauty a thing or two.Estee Lauder (EL) and L'Oreal-owned brands are also sold on Violet Grey.""We ultimately think it makes sense for companies such as Estee Lauder, L'Oreal, and LVMH to offer a limited assortment of prestige beauty brands for sale on Amazon, given the substantial shift in consumer shopping behavior online,"" said Astrachan.He thinks the owners of brands sold on Violet Grey would have right of refusal to sell on Amazon, but if a deal were to happen, ""we would anticipate the independent brands would be most likely to embrace Amazon, with a likely far-more-limited assortment of larger brands being offered for sale in time.""Estee Lauder shares rose 0.2% intraday to 98.92. The stock is at the edge of the buy zone from a 94.57 cup-with-handle base entry point.Prestige beauty brands keep a tight cap on distribution in order to assert control over pricing and brand image. But this news and e-commerce focus is ""modestly favorable"" to both L'Oreal and Estee Lauder, said Astrachan, especially since a broader online presence would ease Estee Lauder's reliance on mid-tier department stores for its sales.... Exactly what kind of impact Amazon is looking to make on the beauty space. And it might be too early to panic, says one expert.Piper Jaffray analyst Erinn Murphy said that Violet Grey's estimated revenue is ""well below"" $5 million a year (while noting Ulta's market cap has taken a $550 million hit so far Wednesday), and that it has a ""tiny"" social-media presence compared to Ulta and Estee Lauder. But it does have ""decent"" traction with celebrities, she said.And according to Piper Jaffray, Violet Grey carries 130 brands, mostly skin care and cosmetics. But only 15 of the brands overlap with Ulta's offerings, such as Dior, Giorgio Armani, MAC and others.""Bottom line, while we recognize the ""headline"" risk of seeing AMZN & any category (in this case, beauty) in the same line, we don't see a near-term risk for the beauty category being disintermediated by Amazon at this juncture,"" wrote Murphy.She has an overweight rating and 330 price target on Ulta Beauty.Amazon, meanwhile, rose 1.2% to 1,052.80, hitting a record high but in buy range from a 1,016,60 entry.

23,MAC,"You'd be forgiven for thinking that all is right with the housing market these days. With prices and sales both soaring nationally, the housing panic of 2007 seems like an all-but-forgotten nightmare. But it's still very much with us.The prestigious State of the Nation's Housing report for 2017, published by Harvard's Joint Center for Housing Studies just last week, touts the newfound health of the housing market.""A decade after the onset of the Great Recession, the national housing market is finally returning to normal,"" the report says. ""With incomes rising and household growth strengthening, the housing sector is poised to become an important engine of economic growth.""Indeed, the trends outlined are impressive. In 2016, U.S. home prices rose 5.6%, ""finally surpassing the high reached nearly a decade earlier,"" the report said. And the number of homeowners still underwater on their mortgages now totals just 3.2 million, down from 12.1 million in 2011.Given such bullish housing trends, Americans might be tempted to think that 2007 was an anomaly, a one-off disaster that won't be repeated. But, in a new first-person account of the financial crisis, a leading housing economist for Freddie Mac suggests that's not the case.Susan Wharton Gates, who worked for Freddie Mac from 1990 until she resigned in 2009, provides a long litany of past sins that led to the housing crisis, including ""expansive Federal Reserve monetary policies, loosely regulated subprime mortgage brokers, unregulated and rapacious Wall Street investors seeking high-yielding assets, conflicted credit rating agencies that failed to accurately assess the risk of subprime securities, millions of suckered, naive or conniving borrows, and widespread regulatory lapses.""And the problem, she told a recent housing conference, is that many of these same policies and attitudes remain in place today. Americans who think the housing market is back may be ignoring that fact.Nor is Gates alone in her concern, a lone voice in the wilderness. Indeed, she's only the most recent of a number of other former housing officials and economists who are sounding the alarms about federal housing policies that could, conceivably, once again lead to a housing market meltdown.Peter J. Wallison, an American Enterprise Institute fellow and author of ""Hidden in Plain Sight: What Really Caused the World's Worst Financial Crisis And Why It Could Happen Again,"" says that Congress' 2010 response to the housing market collapse didn't address the underlying causes of the financial crisis: The imposition of quotas by Congress and federal regulators on mortgage lenders to make more than half of all their loans to low-income borrowers, a recipe for financial disaster.""What Congress did not understand when it adopted the goals was that Fannie and Freddie — which were by far the largest buyers in the mortgage market — set the underwriting standards for everyone else,"" Wallison said earlier this month. ""As a result, their reduced underwriting standards spread to the wider market, creating the subprime loan jamboree that ultimately led to the financial crisis.""By 2008, more than half of all mortgages in the U.S. were subprime, and of these 76% had been bought by government agencies, primarily Fannie and Freddie,"" he added. ""That shows, without question, that government created the demand for these loans.""Meanwhile, the Dodd-Frank financial reform put forward by congressional Democrats was not only an inadequate response to the housing crisis, but actually made the economy far worse and doomed the U.S. to eight years of subpar economic growth.Commenting recently about the CHOICE Act, which repeals major parts of Dodd-Frank, Wallison argued that Dodd-Frank is ""primarily responsible for the historically slow recovery of the U.S. economy since the 2008 financial crisis"" and that it was ""completely unnecessary."" Wallison, who was a member of the official Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission in 2009, wrote a scathing dissent to the committee's official report, which seemed to blame Wall Street and inadequate federal regulation for the meltdown.In fact, the historical record of the early 2000s is pretty clear: Federal meddling in U.S. housing markets was almost entirely to blame for the housing crash and subsequent financial crisis that cause markets to panic and sent the economy into a tailspin. And the federal government is still in the business of directing housing, despite the clear lessons of the recent past.Those who argue for more, rather than less, government involvement in private sector housing need to adjust their opinions. Back in 2006, many people thought the housing market with all that government intervention was doing just fine. Then came 2007. Do we really want to repeat that ugly past?RELATED:Will Gov't Regulation Kill The Housing Market — Again?Happy Birthday, Dodd-Frank Law — Now, Please Kill ItSorry, Hillary, You And Bill — Not Tax Cuts — Caused The Financial Crisis

And freshman enrollment at the University of Missouri has fallen by 35% since the riots during which a faculty member called for ""muscle"" against a student journalist.One reason for the flight, Vedder and Strehle argue, is that the costs of higher education keep rising while the returns for a college diploma are getting worse. Tuitions and fees rose by 74%, adjusted for inflation, from 2000 to 2016, while the earnings differential between high-school and college graduates fell 10%.For years, policymakers subsidized higher education, along with homeownership, because they noticed that college graduates and homeowners earned more and had stronger community ties than others. The thinking was that more subsidies would produce more of both.Instead, over-subsidization led to the bursting of a housing bubble, and it seems to be leading now to what Tennessee law professor Glenn Reynolds identifies as the bursting of the higher-education bubble. The intended beneficiaries were left worse off after foreclosures, and the same may prove true for those with student loan debt (higher today than credit card debt).It certainly looks as if federal aid and student loan and grant money have been vacuumed up by colleges and universities, which nationwide now employ more administrators than teachers. And this administrative bloat has had additional malign effects.College and university administrators have done more to encourage and little to nothing to discourage campus violence — e.g., the attacks on Murray at Middlebury, the riots to bar Ann Coulter from Berkeley and Heather Mac Donald from Claremont, the orgy to punish Bret Weinstein for refusing to stay off campus on ""no whites"" day at Evergreen State.Administrators gleefully accepted the Obama Education Department's ""guidance"" to set up kangaroo courts to deny accused students legal representation, knowledge of charges against them and the right not to testify against themselves — all to combat a bogus crisis of campus rapes based on misleading statistics. This persecution is documented in detail by KC Johnson and Stuart Taylor in the recent book ""The Campus Rape Frenzy.""Administrators have also defended restrictive speech codes, which have made our campuses the part of America least open to free expression, against attacks from the indefatigable Foundation for Individual Rights in Education.Young people planning their futures might be wise to hesitate to commit their time and money to institutions run by the people committing these outrages. And they have reason to suspect they don't offer much in the way of serious education.The long march of the '60s generation has politicized disciplines from English to anthropology. University faculties, which range from the merely liberal to revolutionary leftists — some diversity there! — ensure that many classes are limited to mind-deadening denunciations of dead white men. Students interested in Shakespeare or American constitutional history need not apply.Ethnic and women's studies departments have produced, here and there, some worthy scholarship, but a lot more of it is mindless agitprop. Thousands of Ph.D. theses are submitted each year in incomprehensible politically correct jargon, to be unread by anyone except writer and advisor — or perhaps to be published in the plethora of similarly unread ""peer-reviewed"" journals, whose peer review process is not necessarily as rigorous as you think. One of these published an obvious spoof article submitted in jest, which was titled ""The Conceptual Penis as a Social Construct."" This piece of anything but scholarship went right through without anyone's noticing it was a joke. It argued that penises are best understood as ""an enacted social construct that is both damaging and problematic for society and future generations.""In ""Real Education,"" Charles Murray argued that too many people go to college. Nine years later, it seems that more and more young people are concluding that American higher education — and its administrative bloat — is not worth their time or money. They may well be right.

29,MAC,"XApple (AAPL) received generally positive reviews from Wall Street analysts Tuesday for product announcements at its annual developers conference, which included a smart speaker, upgraded computers and new software for its four platforms.But the biggest reveals, including the HomePod smart speaker, were widely rumored and represented Apple playing catch-up with rivals, analysts said.That left analysts such as Pacific Crest Securities' Andy Hargreaves unimpressed.""Beyond an overly exhaustive list of incremental software features, Apple's new products offered little in the way of meaningful incremental profit opportunities,"" Hargreaves said in a note to clients.Apple made the announcements in the opening keynote for its five-day Worldwide Developers Conference in San Jose, Calif. The most notable was HomePod, a wireless surround-sound music speaker with Siri voice controls.It will compete with already existing Amazon.com's (AMZN) Echo smart speakers and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google Home speakers, but Apple claims HomePod will offer superior sound quality. The 7-inch-tall cylindrical speaker will be available in the U.S. in December for $349.It is designed to work with an Apple Music subscription for access to more than 40 million songs, which can be played with spoken commands. Apple revealed Monday that it now has 27 million Apple Music subscribers.As expected, Apple also updated its Mac notebooks and desktop computers, which were long overdue for a refresh. It upgraded the Macs with the latest Intel (INTC) Kaby Lake processors, faster graphics chips, speedier solid-state drives and other improvements.Plus, Apple announced that it will add Amazon Prime Video to its Apple TV platform later this year, filling its biggest gap with rivals in the segment such as Roku.IBD'S TAKE: Apple stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 94, meaning it has outperformed 94% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months. For more information on Apple stock, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.""Apple is mostly playing catch-up,"" Richard Windsor, an analyst at Edison Investment Research, said in a report.But a few announcements at WWDC on Monday put Apple ahead of the pack, including a revamped App Store for better app discovery and an updated iPad Pro tablet lineup with a new 10.5-inch model, he said.Apple stock rose 0.3% to 154.45 on the stock market today. Shares fell 1% to 153.93 on Monday.CFRA analyst Angelo Zino said the news out of WWDC is positive and he reiterated his strong buy rating on Apple stock. He most liked the enhancements to its mobile operating system with iOS 11 and improvements to the Siri personal assistant.Notable iOS updates included the redesigned App Store, new Map features such as shopping mall floor maps and lane guidance, new camera features and an augmented-reality software development kit called AR Kit, Zino said.Apple's augmented-reality push at the conference is likely a precursor to 3D sensing and AR functions on the iPhone 8 coming this fall, Cowen analyst Timothy Arcuri said in a note to clients. Augmented reality overlays digital information onto the real world through a smartphone display or special glasses.""The AR Kit (augmented reality development platform) was the standout,"" Arcuri said. ""The AR Kit will enable developers to create AR content for iOS users. While we generally expect AR/virtual reality to initially focus on gaming, broader adoption of these technologies is possible.""Apple's WWDC keynote mostly focused on its four software operating systems: iOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS.Guggenheim analyst Robert Cihra said Apple's HomePod looks like a good addition to the product lineup, but he was disappointed by its late arrival and high price. Cihra contends that Apple should have offered a stripped-down model to better compete with Amazon Echo, which has versions costing $50 to $230, and Google Home, which retails for $129.BMO Capital Markets analyst Tim Long said HomePod is likely to be a popular product, but Apple must continue to improve Siri to avoid user frustration with the voice-based interface.Macquarie Research analyst Benjamin Schachter called Apple's WWDC announcements ""solid, if unsurprising.""RELATED:Here's How Apple Will Compete In The Smart-Home Music MarketApple Solves iPhone 8 Technical Snag, Production Still Delayed

30,MAC,"X Consumer electronics giant Apple (AAPL) on Monday introduced a smart surround-sound home music speaker called the HomePod that has Siri voice controls.Apple also rolled out an upgraded lineup of Mac computers and a 10.5-inch iPad Pro and made a host of software announcements on the first day of its Worldwide Developers Conference.The HomePod will be available in December in the U.S., U.K. and Australia and cost $349. The Wi-Fi speaker will come in two colors: white and space gray. It had been rumored last week as a possible announcement for the opening keynote at the conference, which runs through Friday in San Jose, Calif.Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said the speaker has ""amazing sound and incredible intelligence that will reinvent home music.""Phil Schiller, Apple's senior vice president of worldwide marketing, said customers will want to buy two HomePod speakers per room because they automatically work together for great music playback. The HomePod comes with a built-in musicologist, or expert on music, Schiller said. With Siri voice controls, users can ask spoken questions about the songs and artists that are playing and suggest other music to enjoy.Apple's HomePod will compete with Amazon.com's (AMZN) Echo speakers and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google Home device. As with competing products, users can ask HomePod questions about news, weather, traffic and sports, and perform tasks such as setting a reminder or texting a contact.Also Monday, Apple announced that Amazon's Prime Video service will be coming to Apple TV devices later this year. Amazon had been a major holdout from the Apple TV platform. Apple didn't offer additional service launch details.Apple refreshed its Mac computers with the latest Kaby Lake processors from Intel (INTC), as well as faster graphics processors, and speedier and higher-capacity solid-state drives. It updated four MacBook Pro notebooks and three iMac desktop computers.It also previewed the iMac Pro, which boasts ""workstation-class performance."" It will ship in models with 8-core, 10-core or 18-core Intel Xeon processors. It will hit the market later this year.Apple also introduced a new 10.5-inch iPad Pro tablet. The previous iPad Pros had 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch displays. The new 10.5-inch model will replace the 9.7-inch version.The company is touting the 10.5-inch tablet as the perfect size for a full-size, on-screen keyboard and full-size attachable physical keyboard.Apple improved the display refresh rates for its iPads for more realistic and smooth video. And the tablets are getting faster processors, improved cameras and higher memory configurations.At the opening keynote of the conference, Apple detailed the latest developments with its four software operating systems: iOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS. It touted its latest smartphone operating system, iOS 11; new smartwatch operating system, watchOS 4; and new Mac computer operating system, macOS High Sierra.With iOS 11, Apple made improvements to its Siri voice assistant, photo apps and notifications. It also redesigned the Control Center panel.Apple's updated Maps app will add navigation inside shopping malls and airports. And the company's revamped Apple Music app will feature a music-sharing function and playlists linked to other apps.Apple announced new augmented-reality technology for the iPhone. It introduced a kit for developers that takes advantage of the device's cameras, processors and motion sensors.Once rolled out, Apple claims it will have ""the largest AR platform in the world.""Apple also announced that it is redesigning its App Store. It will have a start page called Today for users to discover hot new apps. Games will have its own tab in the app store. Apps besides games will get a dedicated tab as well.The week of WWDC is usually a bad one for Apple stock. Over the last 16 years, during the week of WWDC, Apple stock has only risen once and that was likely because of a 7-for-1 stock split. On average, Apple shares have fallen 3.5% during WWDC week.Apple stock fell 1% to 153.93 on the stock market today.RELATED:Apple Solves iPhone 8 Technical Snag, Production Still DelayedApple Tied With China Firm For Lead In Wearables

33,MAC,"_informq.push(['embed']);In San Francisco, an Indian software engineer on a work permit canceled plans to bid on a $900,000 home. In Washington, a Brazilian nonprofit executive passed on a fixer-upper near her office. And, in Mesa, Ariz., a 24-year-old son of undocumented Mexican immigrants won the trust of a bank — a green light for a mortgage — but now fears deportation.President Trump's immigration policies threaten to crack a foundation of the American economy: the residential real estate market. Legal and otherwise, immigrants, long a pillar of growth in homebuying, are no longer feeling the warm welcome and optimism necessary for their biggest purchase.""I feel like with one stroke of Trump's signature everything can be taken away, even all my hard work,"" said Juan Rodriguez, the 24-year-old whose parents moved from Mexico when he was 7. He now works full time while earning his college degree.President Obama had protected immigrants like Rodriquez, often called ""dreamers,"" or undocumented Americans who arrived as young children and are often fully integrated into American society.On Tuesday, the Trump administration detailed plans for a sweeping crackdown on undocumented immigrants, saying the authorities would deport many more people without court hearings. Under Obama, the government focused on those convicted of violent crimes; Trump would lower the bar to include fraud and, in some cases, a belief the residents threatened public safety.Even workers with green cards and work visas under the H-1B program for skilled foreign workers are worried about possible restrictions under Trump. The housing markets most at risk include Miami, Silicon Valley, Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York, which have the biggest concentrations of foreign-born buyers.While the Trump administration indicated it would exempt dreamers, stepped-up immigration raids and the travel ban on seven majority-Muslim countries — blocked in court — are creating panic in many who believed that their American dream was within sight.""If Trump gets the immigration plan he wants, the housing market will get hit harder than any other,"" said Alex Nowrasteh, a policy analyst for the libertarian Cato Institute. If ""millions of people get deported and more people don't come in to take their place, then you'll have downward pressure on home prices, especially in urban areas.""The immigrant housing market is often underappreciated, in part, because undocumented workers and the companies that cater to them sometimes like to fly below the radar.Some smaller firms will make loans to the undocumented, with higher interest rates. A few larger lenders such as Winston-Salem, North Carolina-based BB&T (BBT) market to dreamers, who can qualify for conventional Fannie Mae (FNMA), Freddie Mac (FMCC) and Federal Housing Administration mortgages.A third of the 11 million unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. live in a home that they or a family member or friend own, according to an analysis by the Migration Policy Institute, a Washington-based think tank.Now, some lenders are starting to get nervous. Las Vegas-based Alterra Home Loans focuses on mortgages for immigrants, including dreamers and the undocumented. At the early stages of government loans, lenders can be on the hook in defaults. ""We're proceeding cautiously,"" said Jason Madiedo, the company's president and chief executive officer.If financing dries up and borrowers lose faith, it will mark a major reversal in the market. New arrivals are expected to account for more than a third of growth of homeowners this decade, according to University of Southern California demographer Dowell Myers.While the U.S. homeownership rate in 2015 was the same as it was in 1994 — 66% — it has risen 2.4 percentage points for the foreign-born population, to more than half, according to real estate website Trulia.Fueling housing demand, immigrants replace baby boomers retiring from the labor force, according to University of Washington economist Jacob Vigdor.By his reckoning, the country's 40 million immigrants add $3.7 trillion to total housing wealth. In Houston's home county, the newcomers boosted the value of the typical home by $25,000 during the decade ended in 2010. Between 2015 and 2065, according to a Pew Research projection, future immigrants and their descendants will account for 88% of the U.S. population increase, or 103 million people.Other foreign buyers could step in. Trump's friendly stance toward Russian President Vladimir Putin is heartening buyers from that country. They had held back after his 2014 Crimean takeover prompted Obama to impose sanctions, according to Edward Mermelstein, a New York-based real estate lawyer who represents wealthy foreigners. His Russian clients negotiating home purchases in New York and Miami more than doubled since Trump took office.But, among groups targeted by Trump, conversations around kitchen tables are now less about payments and more about politics.Even immigrants with high-paying jobs and valid visas are getting skittish. Two of them asked not to be identified because of fears of recrimination.The 32-year-old Silicon Valley software engineer from India gave up on buying because Trump had so rattled him and his wife. He moved to the U.S. seven years ago and decided to become a homeowner after marrying a biomedical engineer from his home country a few months ago.The newlyweds have H-1B visas, a program that technology and other companies rely on to hire 85,000 people each year.""We were about to make some offers,"" he said. ""But we don't know what news will come out and how that will affect our jobs.""Their real estate agent, Nomita Shahani, said a colleague in her office just had a customer with an H-1B visa pull out of a purchase contract in Fremont, Calif., because of similar concerns.""All morning clients have been calling me,"" Shahani said. ""We don't know which way it will go, but if Trump keeps making it hard to hire people from overseas, the housing market will take a hit.""Even immigrants who marry U.S. citizens are losing faith. The 36-year-old Brazilian nonprofit executive, whose husband is an American, is six months away from a permanent green card, one step behind citizenship. After the travel ban and the ensuing chaos, she abandoned plans to bid on a Maryland home only a 15-minute drive from her office.""I just don't want to take my life savings and commit to a house because even if things go my way with the green card, what if the climate here continues to get more and more aggressive toward immigrants?"" said the executive, who is working with real estate brokerage Redfin.Others are even factoring deportation into their homebuying plans. Yadira Hernandez, a 24-year-old dreamer who was 5 years old when she arrived in Phoenix with her mother, isn't giving up her search.While scouting property in the $175,000 range, she's also planning for the worst. If she gets deported, she'll rely on a family member to take over mortgage payments.Hernandez, who has two children and is working full time as a credit counselor, has a goal in her sights: ""I would be the first person in my family to own a house.""MORE ABOUT REAL ESTATE:Are These The Hottest-Selling Suburbs In U.S.?U.S. Homebuyers' Break-Even Point Just Got A Little More DistantSurvey Finds That The Most Affordable Major Housing Markets Are In AmericaTrending Home Improvement Projects For 2017's Housing Market

34,MAC,"One of the most vexing economic issues today is the minimum wage. For many, the failure to raise the minimum wage to $15 or higher is a sign of our nation's stinginess and an essential part of the fight for income equality. However, the truth, sad to say, is quite different, as a new study shows.The study by the American Action Forum, a nonpartisan think tank led by former Congressional Budget Office Director Douglas Holtz-Eakin, looked at minimum-wage hikes scheduled to take effect in the coming years in 14 states and the nation's capital and found they will ""cost millions of jobs across the country and each lost job only leads to total wage earnings rising by a few thousand dollars.""The reason is simple: When you raise the minimum wage of low-skilled, low-productivity labor — a group that disproportionately includes young minority males — you inevitably destroy jobs. No business will hire someone and pay him more than he's worth.So all those states might think they're helping the downtrodden and the poor, and striking a blow for equality by mandating higher wages, but they're doing just the opposite: Pricing many young people out of entry-level jobs.The study estimates that minimum-wage hikes in just 2017 will kill off 383,000 low-end jobs. When phased in over a series of years, the losses become truly big: 2.6 million jobs. But wait, won't the minimum-wage hike at least boost incomes?Yes, but not much. For each job lost, earnings for all the employees affected by the increase would go up just $6,900.""While proposals to raise the minimum wage are well intended, it is important to consider the negative labor market consequences,"" the report said. ""A 10% increase in the real minimum wage is associated with a 0.3 to 0.5 percentage-point decline in the net job rate.""And remember, these numbers are just for 14 states. Imagine a minimum-wage hike to $15 an hour across the country, as the ""Fight for 15"" movement seeks.But another recent study by the National Employment Law Project claims to debunk the idea that a higher minimum wage destroys jobs. Indeed, NELP makes the extraordinary claim that ""to the contrary, in the substantial majority of instances (68%) overall employment increased after a federal minimum-wage increase.""Sounds convincing, on the surface. But as Dave Thompson writes at the Foundation for Economic Education, a look at the study's own data disproves  their contention.Looking at data for 34 years in the retail industry, Thompson found a clear link (though, he warns, that's not the same as causation) between the minimum wage and subsequent employment. Of the 34 years of data, he notes, ""total employment decreases in 4 of the 9 years with a minimum wage increase, whereas such decreases are seen in only 2 of the other 25 years.""For some reason, those on the left are desperate to prove that what economic logic dictates — whenever you raise the cost of something, people demand less of it — isn't true of labor. That's simply false.By the way, as a thought experiment on minimum wages, just think of the organized labor movement.Through collective bargaining, they have been imposing a de facto ""minimum wage"" well above the actual market wage on major companies for decades. It's a kind of ad hoc, industry-by-industry tax on employers, made possible by the threat of strikes and other union actions.If artificially higher wages really didn't affect employment, organized labor should be thriving, right?Well, as the Bureau of Labor Statistics reminded us last week, ""The union membership rate — the percent of wage and salary workers who were members of unions — was 10.7% in 2016, down 0.4 percentage point from 2015. ... The number of wage and salary workers belonging to unions, at 14.6 million in 2016, declined by 240,000 from 2015. In 1983, the first year for which comparable union data are available, the union membership rate was 20.1%, and there were 17.7 million union workers.""It's even worse than it looks, since ""public-sector workers had a union membership rate (34.4%) more than five times higher than that of private-sector workers (6.4%)."" The reason for this is that taxpayers aren't represented at the table when government labor contracts are negotiated. That's a big reason why government workers are less productive but are paid 78% more than private workers for doing the same job.The union-enforced ""minimum wage"" in industry after industry has led to less employment, not more. It's a microcosm of what will happen should the ""Fight for 15"" activists get their way and impose a $15-an-hour minimum wage on American businesses across the board.And if you still think raising the minimum wage is the answer to economic stagnation and inequality, why hasn't Venezuela's move in January to raise its minimum wage by 50% led to higher incomes and jobs for everyone?Here's a prediction: If organized labor and their allies win the ""Fight for 15,"" expect massive layoffs mainly for poor, low-skilled minority workers. Many of their jobs will go to machines or robots, as is happening now in Boston, where McDonald's is rolling out a ""Big Mac ATM"" to dispense its burgers.And, faced with a new, harsh reality, those who now push minimum wages as the answer to ""wage inequality"" will instead then push for more welfare — while vehemently denying that they had anything to do with killing millions of jobs.RELATED:Blame Minimum Wage, Not Carl's Jr. CEO, For Automated Restaurants'Fight For 15': The Most Devastating Minority Job-Killer Ever?Why Minimum Wage Is Bad For Workers, Great For Unions

35,MAC,"Citigroup (C) plans to exit the mortgage-servicing business by the end of 2018 to focus on making new loans.New Residential Investment (NRZ) agreed to pay Citigroup $950 million to buy servicing rights on Fannie Mae- and Freddie Mac-backed loans with $97 billion of outstanding balances, the New York-based buyer said Monday in a statement.Citigroup also reached a deal with Cenlar to service its remaining mortgages, and plans to transfer the rights for those loans beginning in 2018, the bank said in a separate statement.The sale to New Residential, which is subject to regulatory approval, is expected to be completed in the first half of 2017. Citigroup said the agreements will reduce pretax results by about $400 million in the current quarter. Expense benefits will start to accrue in 2018, according to the bank.""The strategic action is intended to simplify CitiMortgage's operations, reduce expenses and improve returns on capital,"" the New York-based company said in the statement.Mortgage servicers handle the billing and collections on home-loan payments and oversee foreclosures. Many banks have pulled back on their servicing units as costs for the business rose and regulatory pressure intensified. Earlier this month, Citigroup agreed to pay $28.8 million to settle allegations by U.S. regulators that two of the bank's mortgage-servicing units misled borrowers.Citigroup's mortgage-servicing rights were worth $1.6 billion at the end of last year, down from $6.5 billion at the end of 2009, according to the company's fourth-quarter earnings statement. The bank produced $371 million in fees from servicing securitized mortgages in the first nine months of last year, down from $416 million in the same period of 2015.As lenders have pared their servicing businesses, non-banks have stepped in. The share of home mortgages serviced by non-banks increased to 24% in 2015 from 6.8% in 2012, according to an April report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office.New Residential, run by Chief Executive Michael Nierenberg, said its servicing business benefited from higher interest rates in the quarter. Higher rates typically dissuade borrowers from paying mortgages early, which increases the value of servicing rights, the company said in a filing.

JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs (GS) are part of the Dow industrials.Meanwhile, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon and other business leaders including the heads of BlackRock (BLK), Tesla (TSLA) and General Motors (GM) also met Trump at the White House to discuss tax policy, trade, infrastructure and women in the workplace.Trump signed an order directing government agencies to plan changes to the Dodd-Frank overhaul put in place after the financial crisis. He also requested a pause to the fiduciary rule, set to take effect in April.Shares of JPMorgan rose 3.1% on the stock market today, rebounding from the 50-day line. Bank of America (BAC) climbed 2.5%, Citigroup (C) added 3.2%.Investment banks were big winners, with a possible ban on proprietary trading among the possible Dodd-Frank provisions that could be rethought: Morgan Stanley (MS) jumped 5.5% and Goldman Sachs rallied 4.6%, both gapping above their 50-day lines.Charles Schwab added 2.55%, E-Trade Financial (ETFC) gained 1.5% and TD Ameritrade (AMTD) rose 1.1%. All three online brokerages fell sharply Thursday after Schwab slashed stock trading commission fees.Even as the Trump administration stacks its ranks with Goldman Sachs (GS) alumni, White House National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn said in a Wall Street Journal article early Friday that the moves had less to do with helping banks and more to do ""with being a player in a global market where we should, could and will have a dominant position as long as we don't regulate ourselves out of that.""Cohn said Dodd-Frank constrains lending and the scope of financial products that banks could offer, while the fiduciary rule restricts consumer options. He also argued that regulations put in place after the housing bust were ineffective.IBD'S TAKE: With financial-management rules likely to change, read this story for more information about the best online brokers this year. Despite the Dodd-Frank criticisms, Trump's regulatory rollback comes after U.S. banks have scooped up market share in Europe as lenders there still try to regain composure after the financial crisis. And Citigroup last year said Mexico had ""tremendous untapped potential,"" setting its sights on Asia as well. But some analysts have expressed concern that trade restrictions could hurt banks' operations in Mexico.After the election, bank stocks soared on deregulation hopes and expectations that faster economic growth would spur wider yield spreads due to higher inflation and Federal Reserve rate hikes. Bank stocks have traded flat to slightly down in 2017, though.Cohn said the White House could try to install a new head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and added that the Treasury Department would try to make sweeping changes at mortgage giants Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FMCC).RELATED:Banks Among Few S&P 500 Beneficiaries As Higher Rates Loom

37,MAC,"Futures for the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq 100 held near record levels early Monday. Apple (AAPL) got a downgrade over post-iPhone 8 risks. Later today the tech titan may unveil a digital assistant device akin to the Amazon (AMZN) Echo and the Google Home from Alphabet (GOOGL).XOn Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite all hit all-time highs. Early Monday morning, S&P 500 futures fell fractionally lower vs. fair value. Dow industrials and Nasdaq 100 futures were just below break-even.Meanwhile, U.S. crude oil futures edged lower. Futures had climbed more than 1% overnight after Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt cut ties with Qatar over its relationship with Iran and support for the Muslim Brotherhood.The Nasdaq composite is now 5% above its 50-day moving average. While that isn't a specific warning sign for investors, over the last several months the tech-heavy index has made short-term tops whenever it has risen that far above the 50-day.The last time was on March 1. After that, the Nasdaq moved sideways for several weeks. That gave time for the 50-day line to catch up — the Nasdaq found support in mid-April — and for new stock consolidations to form.Even with the sideways action, the Nasdaq has still risen for the last seven months and 10 of the last 11. A lot of the credit for that run comes from Apple and the FANG internet stocks Facebook (FB), Amazon, Netflix (NFLX) and Google parent Alphabet.Apple begins its annual Worldwide Developers Conference on Monday. Apple is rumored to be working on a voice-activated digital device powered by its Siri personal assistant. While Apple was a leader with its introduction of Siri years ago, but over the years Amazon and Google have made big strides in hardware and software.Apple is expected to unveil iOS 11, its latest operating system ahead of its 10th generation smartphone expected later this year. I also could refresh its Mac computers and introduce a new Apple TV set-top box.Apple shares have been consolidating for the past three weeks near record highs. That's too short to be actionable yet. The stock is well extended from buy points or follow-on entries.Apple fell 1% in premarket trading. Pacific Crest Securities reduced its rating on Apple to sector weight from overweight. He cited a possible delay in the iPhone 8, and the risk that Apple will face declining sales after the iPhone 8.As for the FANG stocks, Facebook has been consolidating for more than four weeks. If it gets to five weeks, it would have a proper flat base. But shares closed Friday right at all-time levels.Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet all hit record highs last week, with Amazon closing above 1,000 for the first time.In Monday trading, Japan's Nikkei was just below break-even, China's Shanghai composite fell 0.45% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng slid 0.2%.In Europe intraday, the U.K.'s FTSE fell 0.3% and France's CAC-40 lost 0.6%.Saturday night's U.K. terror attack may not have a big impact on financial markets, but could influence the outcome of British elections on Thursday.RELATED:Waiting For A Big Stock Market Pullback?

38,MAC,"X Apple (AAPL) is hosting its annual Worldwide Developers Conference next week where it will detail the latest developments with its four software operating systems: iOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS.The WWDC has been preceded by the usual rumors about what Apple will announce at the five-day show, which starts Monday. One possibility is that Apple will unveil a voice-response smart speaker that uses its Siri personal assistant.For Apple investors, though, WWDC is almost always a disappointment. It's an event that follows the trading strategy of ""buy the rumor, sell the news.""""WWDC week is one of Apple's worst weeks for shareholders,"" Seeking Alpha contributor Bill Maurer said. ""There are always so many rumors that come out before WWDC that don't materialize, making some consumers and investors unhappy.""Last year, Apple shares fell 1.5% on the day of Apple's WWDC opening keynote and slid 3.5% for the week.During the week of WWDC, Apple stock has fallen all but one time in the last 16 years, according to Maurer. On average, Apple shares have fallen 3.5% during WWDC week the last 16 shows. The last time Apple stock rose during WWDC week was when the company's shares split 7-to-1.That disappointment could happen again if Apple doesn't announce its Siri home assistant device, he said.Gene Munster, managing partner of Loup Ventures, put the odds of Apple unveiling a Siri smart speaker at ""60% certainty."" The device would compete with Amazon's (AMZN) market-leading Echo smart speaker with Alexa voice controls and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google Home product.With the Siri speaker, users will be able to get verbal responses to spoken questions about the weather, sports and other topics. The device also will be able to control music playback and home-automation devices with voice commands.IBD'S TAKE: Apple stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 92, meaning it has outperformed 92% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months. For more information on Apple, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.Some analysts believe Apple will announce upgraded Mac computers at the event, because they are overdue for a refresh.""Given that Apple did not host a special event this year, we would not be surprised to hear about select hardware product updates,"" Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White said in a report Friday. ""For example, there have been a slew of media reports pointing to updates around the MacBook family and we believe this is a high-probability event. Moreover, various media reports have highlighted the potential unveiling of a 10.5-inch iPad Pro, which we believe is plausible but not a given.""White gives a lower probability to the Siri speaker being announced, calling it a ""potential dark horse of the event.""But WWDC is first and foremost a software show, so expect new versions of Apple's four operating systems, led by iOS 11 for iPhones and iPads. The new mobile operating system could include augmented-reality capabilities, analysts say.Another rumor is that Apple will announce at WWDC that Amazon Prime Video is coming to the Apple TV set-top box, which runs the tvOS operating system.RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani listed his top five expectations for WWDC in a report Thursday.""We  expect announcements/updates to be mostly software- and Mac-centric, however we think there is high probability Apple will introduce a Siri-enabled smart speaker, which, if announced, would mark the first new hardware product since the Apple Watch,"" Daryanani said.His top five expectations are the introduction of iOS 11, MacBook updates with the latest Intel (INTC) processors and new macOS, a Siri-enabled smart speaker, a new iPad Pro, and updates to watchOS and tvOS.Apple stock finished regular trading at its intraday high of 155.45, up 1.5% on the stock market today. Apple's record intraday high of 156.65 came on May 15.RELATED:Apple Readies Second New Hardware Category Under CEO Tim CookApple Seen Announcing Siri Device, These Other Releases At WWDC

40,MAC,"Dodd-Frank: With little fanfare and even less media coverage, the House Financial Services Committee recently approved along party lines a bill that would significantly reform the economy-deadening Dodd-Frank law. It's a good first step toward restoring our financial freedom.The fact is, the 2010 Dodd-Frank law has been a disaster, responsible for killing hundreds of thousands of U.S. jobs and putting a damper on economic growth by making credit harder to come by for those who need it most.In a recent interview with NPR, House Financial Services Chairman Jeb Hensarling of Texas made a succinct case for getting rid of Dodd-Frank: ""Free checking at banks has been cut in half. Banking fees have gone up. Working people are finding it more difficult to get mortgages,"" he said.He could have gone further. Small- to medium-size banks — the traditional sources of working capital for small business — have been hurt worst by Dodd-Frank's extensive regulations that impose billions of dollars in unnecessary costs each year. And rather than repealing too-big-to-fail for big banks, Dodd-Frank actually makes it all but certain that taxpayers will be asked to bailout big banks during the next downturn.Worse still, for many Americans, one of Dodd-Frank's creations, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), has made it harder to get credit and severely limited consumers' financial choices. So this was an improvement?Dodd-Frank was passed in a panic in 2010 following the financial crisis. But the whole premise behind Dodd-Frank was a mistake from Day One, built entirely on a far-left progressive narrative that Wall Street banks were to blame for the financial meltdown. This was false. The crisis was caused by heavy-handed regulation of mortgage lending by HUD, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, starting in the Clinton administration.Under regulatory threat from the government, banks made loans they knew were bad, then the government bought them back. When the Fed went too far in raising interest rates in the mid-2000s, the housing market cratered, banks' balance sheets were destroyed, and a massive credit crunch and the ""Great Recession"" ensued. The government caused this crisis — not Wall Street.As we've written repeatedly in the past, Dodd-Frank should have been shut down long ago. It has strangled entrepreneurial activity and dampened economic growth, and made it impossible for millions of Americans to get home loans. It's a major reason why GDP during the Obama years grew at a pathetic 1.9% rate, rather than the more normal rate of 3% or more.We hope the House will move quickly to end Dodd-Frank, one of the worst financial regulatory laws in modern history.RELATED:Don't Reform Dodd-Frank — Shut It DownDodd-Frank's Failure ReconfirmedHappy Birthday, Dodd-Frank Law — Now, Please Kill It

41,MAC,"Consumer electronics giant Apple (AAPL) late Tuesday handily beat sales and earnings estimates for the December quarter thanks to better-than-expected iPhone sales.Apple stock jumped 3% in after-hours trading on the stock market today following the earnings news release. During the regular session, Apple stock dipped 0.3% to 121.35.Apple sold 78.3 million iPhones during its fiscal first quarter, up 5% from the same quarter last year. Analysts on average were looking for 77 million units in the holiday sales quarter.Results: Apple earned $3.36 a share, up 2% year over year, on sales of $78.35 billion, up 3%, in the quarter ended Dec. 31. Analysts were expecting Apple to earn $3.21 a share on sales of $77.25 billion.Apple's Q1 results marked a return to growth after three straight quarters of declining sales and EPS on a year-over-year basis.Outlook: Apple expects sales of $52.5 billion in the current quarter, based on the midpoint of its guidance. It did not give an EPS target. Wall Street had been modeling for Apple to earn $2.08 a share on sales of $53.79 billion in the March quarter, its fiscal Q2.Most analysts have expected Apple's results to be muted ahead of the launch this fall of its 10th-generation smartphone, which has been called the iPhone 8, iPhone 10 and iPhone X by various pundits. That phone is expected to be a major revamp featuring an OLED display.Stock Action: Apple stock broke out of a cup-with-handle chart pattern on Jan. 9, clearing a buy point of 118.12. It has remained in the buy zone since then.""We're thrilled to report that our holiday quarter results generated Apple's highest quarterly revenue ever, and broke multiple records along the way,"" Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a statement. ""We sold more iPhones than ever before and set all-time revenue records for iPhone, Services, Mac and Apple Watch.""Apple had a ""tremendous quarter"" for iPhone sales in Q1, with ""especially strong demand for iPhone 7 Plus,"" Cook said on a conference call with analysts. The premium iPhone 7 Plus handset has a dual-camera feature for taking high-quality photos.Apple services revenue grew strongly, led by record customer activity on the App Store, Cook said.

42,MAC,"Consumer electronics maker Apple (AAPL) surprised Wall Street late Tuesday with better-than-expected sales and earnings in the December quarter, fueled by record iPhone sales, sending its shares to 18-month highs.Apple CEO Tim Cook called the company's fiscal first-quarter results ""outstanding"" on a conference call with analysts. He said they could have been even better if Apple had built more units of the iPhone 7 Plus, MacBook Pro, iPad and Apple Watch during the quarter. The company was production-constrained on the iPhone 7 Plus and MacBook Pro, but misjudged holiday season demand for the iPad and Apple Watch.Apple's Q1 marked a return to growth for the Cupertino, Calif.-based company, which had seen declining sales and EPS in the preceding three quarters.Apple earned $3.36 a share, up 2% year over year, on sales of $78.35 billion, up 3%, in the quarter ended Dec. 31. Analysts were expecting $3.21 and $77.25 billion.IBD'S TAKE: Apple stock broke out of a cup-with-handle chart pattern on Jan. 9, clearing a buy point of 118.12. For more information on Apple, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.For the current quarter, Apple expects sales of $52.5 billion, up 4%, based on the midpoint of its traditionally conservative guidance. It did not give an EPS target. Wall Street had been modeling Apple to earn $2.08 a share, up 10%, on sales of $53.79 billion, up 7%, in the March quarter, its fiscal Q2.Apple stock jumped 6.2% to 128.87 on the stock market today, still in a buy zone from breakout in early January at 118.12.What follows are several key takeaways from Apple's Q1 report:Apple sold 78.3 million iPhones during the December quarter, up 5% year over year. The increase follows three straight quarters of declining iPhone sales.The average selling price for iPhones rose to $695 in the December quarter from $619 in the September quarter thanks to the success of the iPhone 7 Plus. That top-of-the-line model was supply-constrained throughout the quarter and did not reach supply-demand balance until January, Cook said.The iPhone 7 Plus features a dual-camera system for taking high-quality photos, especially portraits. IPhone sales accounted for 69.4% of Apple's total revenue in the quarter. Apple generated $54.4 billion in iPhone sales in fiscal Q1, up 5%.Apple's second-largest business in Q1 was its Mac computer unit, which generated $7.24 billion in sales, or 9.2% of revenue. Services came in third with $7.17 billion, or just under 9.2% of revenue.Services were Apple's fastest-growing business in Q1, with revenue up 18% year over year. The company's App Store was the biggest driver of growth, executives said.""Services are becoming a larger part of our business, and we expect the revenues to be the size of a Fortune 100 company this year,"" Cook told analysts. ""Our goal is to double the size of our services business in the next four years.""Apple's services portfolio includes the App Store, iTunes, iCloud, Apple Music, AppleCare, Apple Pay, among others. Apple manages over 150 million paid customer subscriptions through its services unit, including its own services and third-party services offered on its App Store, Cook said.Apple's App Store revenue grew 43% in Q1 vs. the comparable period a year earlier, Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said.Cook described the company's foray into original video programming for its Apple Music service as a ""toe in the water."" The company will be learning from its experience in original content and seeing where it can go from there.""With our toe in the water, we're learning a lot about the original content business and thinking about ways that we could play at that,"" Cook said.Apple has long been rumored to be interested in offering a streaming video service, as competition for either pay-TV services or on-demand services like Netflix (NFLX). Apple sees its Apple TV set-top box as a platform for internet video services. Cook believes the media industry is beginning to see the traditional cable TV programming bundle break down.Cook spent some time on the analyst call to tout Apple's efforts in home automation.""We are leading the industry by being the first to integrate home automation into a major platform with iOS 10,"" Cook said. ""With Siri and a new Home app in iOS 10, everywhere you go, you can easily and securely control all of your home accessories with your iPhone, iPad, or your Apple Watch.""Four weeks ago, Amazon's (AMZN) Alexa voice control system dominated the CES consumer electronics show in Las Vegas. Scores of device vendors announced plans to integrate Alexa into their products, so users can control them using spoken commands. Apple was a no-show at CES 2017.Perhaps feeling left out of the conversation, Cook pitched Apple's play in home automation with its HomeKit.""The number of HomeKit-compatible accessories continues to grow rapidly, with many exciting solutions announced just this month, including video cameras, motion detectors, and sensors for doors, windows, and even water leaks,"" Cook said. ""Perhaps even more importantly, we are unmatched when it comes to securing your home with HomeKit-enabled door locks, garage doors, and alarm systems.""Cook discussed his own use of Apple home automation services.""I'm personally using HomeKit accessories and the Home app to integrate iOS into my home routine,"" Cook said. ""Now when I say good morning to Siri, my house lights come on and my coffee starts brewing. When I go to the living room to relax in the evening, I use Siri to adjust the lighting and turn on the fireplace. And when I leave the house, a simple tap on my iPhone turns the lights off, adjusts the thermostat down, and locks the doors.""When I return to my house in the evening, as I near my home, the house prepares itself for my arrival automatically by using a simple geofence. This level of home automation was unimaginable just a few years ago, and it's here today with iOS and HomeKit.""With the Apple Watch, AirPods wireless ear buds and Beats headphones, Apple is now a major player in the wearable device market, Cook said.""With AirPods off to a fantastic start, a strong full first year for Apple Watch, and Beats headphones offering a great wireless experience using the Apple-designed W1 chip, we now have a rich lineup of wearable products,"" Cook said. ""Their design, elegance, and ease of use make us very excited about the huge growth potential for wearables going forward.""Apple did not give sales figures for the recently launched AirPods and second-generation Apple Watch.RELATED:Apple Crushes Fiscal Q1 Estimates, Stock Jumps LateApple iPhone 8 To Get 3D-Sensing Tech For Augmented-Reality Apps

44,MAC,"The reported plan by Apple (AAPL) to switch to its own processors for Mac computers likely will have a minor impact on supplier Intel (INTC), Wall Street analysts said Tuesday.Bloomberg reported Monday that Apple is developing its own Mac computer chips as part of a strategy to make all of its devices work more similarly and seamlessly together. Apple already designs chips for its iPhone, iPad and other devices. Most of those chips are produced under contract by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM).Apple could start using its own chips in Mac desktop and notebook computers as soon as 2020, Bloomberg reported.Intel shares gained 1.7% to close at 49.75 on the stock market today. The chipmaker's shares tumbled 6.1% on Monday after the news report was first posted.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseIf Apple steps away from its partnership with Intel on Mac processors, the impact to Intel would be ""less severe than investors seem to fear,"" Evercore ISI analyst C.J. Muse said in a note to clients. Muse reiterated his outperform rating on Intel stock with a price target of 55.""While this is clearly a risk to Intel, we believe it is a minor one, as Apple CPUs (central processing units) likely drive only about 4% of Intel's revenue,"" Muse said. ""Were Apple to stop using Intel CPUs, it would likely do so gradually, with the final (earnings) hit likely comprising less than 3% of (earnings) in the early 2020s — which will likely be more than offset by Intel's operational improvements and top-line growth elsewhere.""Intel is likely to gain more sales of wireless baseband chips for the iPhone in the years ahead, he said. Also, Intel's business has been shifting more to chips for data centers and away from PCs, Muse noted.Credit Suisse analyst John Pitzer called the sell-off in Intel shares on Monday ""an overreaction"" by investors.Apple last year sold 19 million Mac computers, accounting for about 7% of the overall PC market, Pitzer said.Intel probably will generate about $2.7 billion from Mac chip sales in 2019, or about 4% of its revenue. Earnings from the business are seen at about 17 cents per share, or 4% of the company's total earnings per share, he said.RELATED:Intel Stock Hit By Report Apple Switching To Own Chips For MacsApple iPhone Customers Choosing Cheaper Handsets, Analyst Says

46,MAC,"I'm not surprised that mobs shriek at Trump administration officials in restaurants and that Maxine Waters wants more of that. I've watched this happen at American colleges.One example:Heather Mac Donald is a Manhattan Institute scholar who wrote the book ""The War on Cops."" She argues that Americans are less safe today because police, for fear of being called racist, back off. I sometimes disagree with Mac Donald, but she is a thoughtful researcher whose ideas deserve to be heard.At UCLA, when she was allowed to give her ""Blue Lives Matter"" speech, many in the audience applauded.But then ""they stormed the stage,"" she explains in my video interview with her.The protesters, both white and black, shouting ""Black lives — they matter!"" drowned out any possible questions.Watching video of the event, I was surprised to see what looked like a party atmosphere. Protesters smiled as they got out cameras and recorded each other.""It's almost an expectation that if you're a minority student on campus, you're there to protest,"" Mac Donald told me.Eventually, the UCLA protesters took over the stage. No further discussion was possible.From UCLA, Mac Donald went to Claremont University, where she was met with posters that said her speech should be ""shut down"" because she is an ""anti-black fascist."" I asked Mac Donald about that.""This is preposterous. I have spent enormous amounts of time in high-crime, minority neighborhoods talking to good people there who are desperate for more police, who have a right to expect the same freedom from fear that people in safer neighborhoods take for granted,"" she replied.

47,MAC,"Housing: With home prices soaring in most markets, this is the best time to be a homeowner since 2005. But there's a downside: Thanks to continued government meddling, the housing market has rarely been more fragile. Is another housing crunch brewing?We've talked before about the strength of the U.S. economy, particularly after tax cuts kicked in. And that's still true. Unfortunately, 10 years after the 2008 financial crisis, there's one exception: The housing market, which, despite superficial signs of health, remains dysfunctional.Homeowners are happy now, but they may soon be reeling. The Fed, worried about ultralow 3.8% unemployment and rising incomes, has signaled it could raise rates as many as seven times between now and the end of 2019. Not only would new buyers no longer qualify to buy homes, but homeowners who bought during the Fed's zero-interest rate days might get a severe shock as payments surge and buyer demand dries up.Right now, housing suffers from an affordability crisis. Despite median household income rising strongly since President Trump took office, the average price for a new home today is just under $330,000, vs. about $248,000 in 2006, before the last housing crisis. Higher Fed rates followed by a downturn in housing prices would devastate the U.S. economy.How did we get here? Unfortunately, you can blame government. Neither Fannie Mae nor Freddie Mac, the two mortgage giants that caused the 2007 housing meltdown, were dismantled. Instead, Washington rewarded them with an even larger role than before.""Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, while still in conservatorship and with the blessing of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, are once again expanding into new products and programs with abandon — and in the process potentially adversely affecting industries, businesses and careers,"" wrote Edward J. Pinto, co-director of the American Enterprise Institute's Center on Housing Markets and Finance, and Tom La Malfa, a 40-year mortgage industry veteran, in the American Banker.Only one difference: Now taxpayers own the two housing-finance delinquents. Thus when the next housing meltdown occurs, taxpayers will own it. And they'll have to decide whether to bail out homeowners and banks, or just blame it all on ""deregulation"" and greedy Wall Street, as happened last time.In the meantime, despite high home prices, Fannie and Freddie continue to pump money into heavily subsidized mortgages, artificially boosting home prices. This is not how free markets work.In the next housing crisis, banks will hold hundreds of billions in bad loans and the economy will again crater. Then what? Rather than waiting for disaster, why not do what we should've done years ago? Either privatize Fannie and Freddie or shut them down, while the economy's strong and we still have time.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Dodd-Frank: Taking A Chisel, Not A Hammer, To This Awful Law Isn't Enough — But It's A StartCan New Fed Chief Powell Avoid Fed's Past Disastrous Mistakes?Will Gov't Regulation Kill The Housing Market — Again?

49,MAC,"A new study on racial disparities in police conduct found that differences in offending by suspects — not racism — explains officers' responses.In the study ""Is There Evidence of Racial Disparity in Police Use of Deadly Force?"" professors from Michigan State and Arizona State universities analyzed officer-involved fatal shootings in 2015 and 2016.The report's abstract says:""We benchmark two years of fatal shooting data on 16 crime rate estimates. When adjusting for crime, we find no systematic evidence of anti-black disparities in fatal shootings, fatal shootings of unarmed citizens, or fatal shootings involving misidentification of harmless objects. ... Exposure to police given crime rate differences likely accounts for the higher per capita rate of fatal police shootings for blacks, at least when analyzing all shootings. For unarmed shootings or misidentification shootings, data are too uncertain to be conclusive.""Two recent studies found cops more reluctant to use deadly force against blacks, including one by a black Harvard economist. Professor Roland G. Fryer Jr. concluded: ""On the most extreme use of force — officer-involved shootings — we find no racial differences in either the raw data or when contextual factors are taken into account.""But aren't blacks routinely ""racially profiled"" by cops? Not according to the Police-Public Contact Survey. Produced every three years by the Department of Justice's Bureau of Justice Statistics, the survey asks more than 60,000 people about their interactions with the police. It asks respondents' to provide age, race and gender. It asks them whether they had any contact with the police in the last year; what was the experience like; how were your treated; was there a use of force and so on.Turns out, according to a September 2017 National Review article, black men and white men are about equally likely to have a contact with a cop in a given year. As to multiple contacts, defined as three or more with the police in a given year, 1.5% of blacks vs. 1.2% of whites fall in that category. Not much difference.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThere's also the National Crime Victimization Survey, which questions victims of crimes, whether or not the criminal was captured, as to the race and ethnicity of the suspect. It turns out that the race of the arrested matches the percentage given by victims. So unless victims are lying about the race of their assailant, unconcerned about whether he gets caught, blacks are not being ""overarrested.""A reasonable discussion about blacks and police practices cannot take place without acknowledging the disproportion amount of crime committed by blacks. According to the Department of Justice's ""Felony Defendants in Large Urban Counties, 2009,"" in the country's 75 largest counties, blacks committed 62% of robberies, 45% of assaults and accounted for 57% of murder defendants.The No. 1 cause of preventable death for young white men is accidents, such as car accidents. The No. 1 cause of preventable death for young black men is homicide, usually committed by another young black man, not a cop. In 2016, according to the latest data from the FBI's Uniform Crime Report, 7,881 blacks were killed.The courageous Manhattan Institute's Heather Mac Donald, who writes extensively about police practice, asked:""Who is killing these black victims? Not whites, and not the police, but other blacks. In 2016, the police fatally shot 233 blacks, the vast majority armed and dangerous. ... Contrary to the Black Lives Matter narrative, the police have much more to fear from black males than black males have to fear from the police. In 2015, a police officer was 18.5 times more likely to be killed by a black male than an unarmed black male was to be killed by a police officer.""In 2012 in the city of Rialto, California, population approximately 100,000, cops were randomly assigned body cameras based on their shifts. Over the next year, use-of-force incidents on the shifts that had cameras were half the rate of those without cameras. But something rather extraordinary also happened. Complaints against all Rialto police officers with were down almost 90% from the prior year.It turns out when civilians knew they were being recorded, they — not the cops — behaved better and stop making false accusations. The use of force by cops also declined, but, again, not because the police changed their conduct. No, the cops continued performing as they'd been trained. Civilians, aware that they were being taped, were less confrontational and were more likely to cooperate and follow instructions. As a result, cops needed to use force less frequently.Still, when actor Jesse Williams gave a four-minute rant at the 2016 BETAwards about what he considered racist police practices, he claimed, ""What we've been doing is looking at the data, and we know that police somehow manage to de-escalate, disarm and not kill white people every day.""Other columns by Larry ElderMore Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

54,MAC,"Being in the American restaurant business is tough, as cheaper groceries, heightened competition and never-ending searches for growth abound.Growth by novelty is one way to prosper. Take two recent limited-offer efforts from a couple of industry giants: Starbucks' (SBUX) recent unleashing of the rainbow-colored Unicorn Frappuccino and Yum Brands' (YUM) debut of the Taco Bell Naked Chicken Chalupa — featuring a shell made out of fried chicken.""(In a) saturated market, you've got to make your brand stand out,"" Morningstar's restaurant analyst, R.J. Hottovy, told Investor's Business Daily. ""You maybe have to push the envelope a little bit more in terms of menu innovation, and get people talking about your brand. I think that that's what you're seeing more and more of.""Another way to grow is to simply swallow another company whole, as in the case of Restaurant Brands International (QSR).The parent of Burger King and Canada's Tim Hortons outlets, Restaurant Brands is growing by acquisition, recently closing the buyout of Popeye's Chicken and adding the fried-chicken chain to its portfolio of burgers, coffee and doughnuts. The decision was broadly well-received.""I think it gives (Restaurant Brands) an interesting growth vehicle down the road,"" said Hottovy, adding that demand for fried chicken could be particularly appealing to the company's franchising partners abroad.Following a quarter of weaker-than-expected same-store sales growth in North America, Restaurant Brands' management sounded bullish on expanding Popeye's abroad.""One of the reasons we get really excited is the ability to accelerate the pace of growth, both in the U.S. and Canada, and all around the world,"" said Restaurant Brands Chief Executive Daniel Schwartz about the deal, on the April 26 call to discuss first-quarter earnings.For the quarter, profit of 36 cents a share marked 20% year-over-year growth and topped consensus by 2 cents. Revenue rose 9% to $1 billion, exceeding estimates for $990.3 million. But weak year-ago sales comparisons, including a 2.2% decline at Burger King's U.S. restaurants and a 0.2% dip at Tim Hortons' Canadian locations, marred the consensus beat.A certain Big Mac maker might have been to blame for the same-store-sales slips. In a world filled with artisanal burgers and trendy Shake Shack (SHAK)-type eateries, McDonald's (MCD) ubiquity still provides enormous power.""The comps were a little bit softer than what people were expecting, and I think probably you can trace a good portion of that back to McDonald's success,"" said Hottovy. ""A comp point for McDonald's has a much more disproportionate impact on the rest of the industry, just given its size and scale.""But it's worth keeping in mind that for Restaurant Brands, same-store sales growth isn't necessarily the most significant metric.""In a virtually 100% highly franchised business model like (Restaurant Brands), unit openings drive more operating leverage than comps,"" Cowen analyst Andrew Charles noted the day after earnings were released. He has a market-perform rating on the restaurateur with a 54 price target. And Piper Jaffray's Nicole Miller Regan reiterated her overweight rating and 66 price target.""Continued execution against the company's strategic blueprint as well as cash flows being returned to shareholders at an increasing rate (i.e., recently raised dividend now yielding 1.3%) remains the key catalyst,"" she wrote in late April.To be a fast-food giant in 2017 almost seems quaint, given the trends toward customized meals, natural and organic fare, and millennial-friendly experiences. But Burger King, the Pepsi to McDonald's Coca-Cola, remains engaged in a heated rivalry with the Golden Arches as both attempt to align their technology with modern customers.Burger King is reportedly debuting mobile payments soon. That feature is currently in test mode in the Miami area, according to Bloomberg, citing Burger King head Jose Cil on Tuesday.IBD'S TAKE: Restaurant Brands tried to break out of a two-month-long flat base on April 25, immediately retreated the next day and then mounted another breakout on May 5 and hasn't looked back since. Shares continue to reach new highs. The company is currently ranked fourth in IBD's Retail-Restaurants Group, behind Dave & Buster's (PLAY).There's no national release date yet, but no doubt the Whopper maker is eyeing McDonald's plans to debut a mobile-order-and-pay platform in 20,000 locations by the end of 2017. Both lag behind Starbucks' robust mobile-order-and-pay system, an app feature that has become so popular, so quickly, that it actually wound up creating congestion in many locations a couple of quarters ago.Hottovy considers all three big foodie names winners, despite the macro pressures.""Some of the efforts McDonald's has done has put them in the winners' camp, and I think that's had a halo effect over probably Restaurant Brands as well as Dunkin' (DNKN) at this point,"" said Hottovy, adding that Starbucks would still be considered a winner despite not being at the top of its game.Both the BK parent and McDonald's have performed well in recent months. After struggling to break out of a flat base with 58.08 entry point, Restaurant Brands shares rose decisively into buy range on May 5. Its Relative Strength rating, which pits its performance against the S&P 500, is a solid 87.McDonald's recent ascent has been even sharper, gapping up 5.6% on its April 25 earnings report.As far as growth is concerned, McDonald's might have to contend with an ever-larger rival. After all, Restaurant Brands was born of a 2014 merger between 3G Capital-backed Burger King and Tim Hortons.The company will ""probably continue to look for more acquisitions in the future,"" said Hottovy.  ""Tough to say exactly where, but I think it gives them nice new growth and cost-cutting opportunities at the same time.""And Restaurant Brands is not totally immune to the charms of novelty items.

55,MAC,"Ulta Beauty (ULTA) shares broke out of a flat base Wednesday as cosmetics conglomerate Estee Lauder (EL), which owns a number of brands sold at Ulta, posted a view-topping quarter.Ulta shares rallied 0.6% to 290.36 on the stock market today, topping a 289.37 entry point, after climbing 1.9% on Tuesday. Ulta hit an all-time high of 291.50 intraday. Minus a slight dip below its 50-day moving average last month, the stock has been on a steady upward climb above that key level since November.Specialty beauty retailers such as Ulta and LVMH (LVMUY)-owned Sephora are having a moment as they enjoy popularity with younger shoppers flocking to the latest makeup trends.For Q3, Estee Lauder's adjusted diluted profit grew 24.7% to 91 cents, crushing consensus views for 73 cents compiled by Zacks Investment Research, while net sales grew 8% to $2.86 billion, above Zacks views for $2.81 billion.Estee Lauder shares gapped up 4.4% to 91.30, hitting their highest level since August, and e.l.f. Beauty (ELF) edged up 0.5% to 26.79.While Estee Lauder is often associated with its traditional flagship brand sold at department stores, the conglomerate has been working on building its audience, rolling out the Estee Edit at Sephora last year. The parent of MAC Cosmetics and Clinique has in recent months announced the acquisitions of Too Faced and Becca, hot brands with the millennial and Gen Z set.Plus, MAC is hitting Ulta Beauty's online shelves at the end of the week (and physical stores in June), a move that has been well received by the beauty enthusiast community.""Bottom line, while some investors may be concerned that half of the strong sales growth in the quarter was driven by recent acquisitions, results nonetheless highlight the momentum in EL's business,"" said Wells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog in a note early Wednesday. She has an outperform rating on Estee Lauder.But Stifel's Mark Astrachan, who has a buy rating on the makeup giant, has a watchful eye on softness in the Americas, organic sales growth that was ""far below"" peers L'Oreal and LVMH, plus declining gross margin.On Monday, Piper Jaffray's Erinn Murphy said that while risk remains for Estee Lauder, given its department store exposure, ""the narrative of EL should improve, particularly with its ULTA initiatives (fastest growing; No. 2 destination).""

57,MAC,"Do college students — and their parents — truly understand how thoroughly left-wing professors dominate the humanities side of academia?Many people know that most professors are liberal, but the degree to which the left wing rules is jaw-dropping. A study published last September in Econ Journal Watch, ""Faculty Voter Registration in Economics, History, Journalism, Law, and Psychology,"" documents the overwhelming left-wing nature of the voter registration of college profs at 40 leading universities. An examination of voter registration in five departments found that Democrats outnumber Republicans by 11 1/2-to-1. Even in economics, where one would think that views would be driven by data, not politics, Democrats outnumbered Republicans 4 1/2-to-1. History was practically foreign terrain for Republicans, as Democrats outnumbered them 33 1/2-to-1.And it's getting worse. A 1968 study put the Democrat-to-Republican ratio in history departments at 2.7-to-1. This latest study found that among profs 65 and older, Democrats outnumber Republicans by 10 to 1. But for scholars under the age of 36 the ratio is 22.7-to-1.In 2012 the California Association of Scholars published the results of a two-year study about the bias of professors in the University of California system. The study claims that professors' bias ""corrupts"" education, turning schools into indoctrination camps. According to the National Association of Scholars: ""The report documented curricula that promote political activism, in violation of UC regulations. For example, one course aims to be a 'training ground' for 'advocates committed to racial justice theory and practice.'"" The CAS report also cited earlier studies that found that associate and assistant professors, those waiting in the wings, are ever more likely to be registered as Democrats. Among UC Berkeley's associates and assistants, said the report, registered Democrats outnumber registered Republicans by 49-to-1 in (SET ITAL) all (END ITAL) departments — including sciences.What about commencement speakers?Of the political speakers, left-wingers dramatically outnumber conservatives. The student political advocacy group Campus Reform looked at last year's commencement speakers for the top 100 colleges and universities from U.S. News & World Report's annual ranking of best colleges. Of the then-announced speakers associated with political messages, 40 were liberal and 10 conservative, a ratio of 4-to-1 in favor of Democrats.What about political contributions?In the 2012 presidential election, a Campus Reform study found that 96% of the Ivy League's faculty and staffers who made campaign donations sent their checks to Barack Obama. At Brown University, just one professor contributed to Mitt Romney's campaign. Employees of the eight prestigious schools sent more than $1.2 million to President Obama, but contributed just $114,166 to Romney's campaign — a ratio of more than 10-to-1 in favor of Obama.This brings us to what can only be described as Trump Derangement Syndrome, campus style. UC Berkeley claims, in effect, that it cannot protect students and property, therefore ""incendiary"" conservative speakers like Ann Coulter and David Horowitz — who actually attended graduate school there — had to cancel their proposed speeches. Meanwhile, at Claremont McKenna College in California, students blocked entry to those who came to hear pro-cop researcher Heather Mac Donald. ""Activists"" called Mac Donald a ""white supremacist fascist,"" among other things, for researching and concluding that, no, cops are not engaging in illegal racial profiling. At Middlebury College, a professor who co-sponsored the invitation to conservative Charles Murray, which prompted a riot, apologized — to the rioters! Another California human psychology professor called Trump's election ""an act of terrorism.""Dartmouth recently conducted a field survey of nearly 500 of its students and found that 45% of the students who self-identified as Democrats said they would be ""uncomfortable"" rooming with a conservative, while only 12% of Republican students said that they would be ""uncomfortable"" with a liberal roommate.The question is whether left-wing professors create left-wing students. To say there is no effect is to say teachers don't matter. Consider this. In an attempt to quantify the effect of media bias, UCLA economics and political science professor Tim Groseclose writes: ""(The) average voter received approximately 8.2% of his news from Fox, and 79.9% from establishment media (defined as all outlets except Fox, the internet and talk radio). Thus, the 'reach' of establishment media is approximately 10 times that of Fox News."" He says in presidential elections, liberal media bias gives Dems an advantage of eight to 10 points. Were the media truly fair and balanced, concludes Groseclose, the average state would vote the way Texas does.Is it not reasonable to assume that professors have at least some measure of influence on their students? Have many professors crossed the line from education to indoctrination? Will opposing views be tolerated and respected? Does a student run a risk of facing grade retaliation by a Trump-hating poli-sci professor?Campus activists have long complained about ""microaggressions,"" for which they demand ""safe spaces."" Is there any place where a left-wing student can feel safer than a college campus, where conservatives are not just unwanted but cannot even speak?

58,MAC,"Steven Mnuchin, Donald Trump's nominee to be the next Treasury secretary, said comments he made last year on Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FMCC) were not meant to endorse a view that the government should quickly recapitalize the companies and then sell its stakes in them.""My comments were never that there should be recap and release,"" Mnuchin said Thursday during his confirmation hearing before the Senate Finance Committee. ""I believe that these are very important entities to provide the necessary liquidity for housing finance.""Mnuchin's comments, made in response to a question from Democratic Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, temporarily sent shares of Fannie and Freddie down by about 10%. The shares had mostly recovered as of 1:45 p.m. ET.Last November, Mnuchin said in a television interview with Fox Business that he thought Fannie and Freddie should be privatized and quickly leave government control. The companies jumped 46% after the remarks.Fannie and Freddie buy mortgages from lenders, package them into bonds and make guarantees protecting investors from default. The government took control of the companies during the financial crisis, eventually injecting $187.5 billion. Since 2012, the companies have sent taxpayers more than $250 billion in dividends.At Thursday's hearing, Mnuchin said, ""We need housing reform so we shouldn't just leave Fannie and Freddie as is for the next four or eight years under government control without a fix.""He said he didn't want to make any commitments on what policy surrounding the companies would be, including whether the Trump administration might try to take action on its own, instead of waiting for Congress to pass legislation.The companies still have more than $258 billion in funding available from the Treasury, but under the current terms of the bailout agreement, must wind down their capital to zero dollars by next year. That means any small hiccup will require the companies to again require money from taxpayers.

59,MAC,"Purchases of new U.S. homes fell in December to a 10-month low, suggesting the postelection jump in mortgage rates pushed out potential buyers. But shares of homebuilders rallied Thursday morning as Pulte Group (PHM) was the latest to report strong quarterly earnings.Single-family house sales dropped 10.4%, the most in almost two years, to a 536,000 annualized pace, Commerce Department data showed Thursday. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey was for 588,000.The average interest rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage reached 4.32% at the end of December, the highest since April 2014, according to Freddie Mac figures. That was up from 3.54% just before the Nov. 8 election. It was 4.09% in the week ended Jan. 19.Optimism about President Trump's plans to spur economic growth through tax cuts and looser regulation triggered a rise in Treasury yields and a corresponding increase in mortgage rates. The Federal Reserve is also projected to raise its benchmark interest rate several times this year.The supply of homes for sale increased to 5.8 months, the highest since September 2015, from 5 months in November. There were 259,000 new houses on the market at the end of December, the most since 2009.However, Pulte Group, which mainly sells single-family homes, earned 67 cents excluding various items, up 18% and beating views for 59 cents. Revenue climbed 21% to $2.42 billion.

Horton (DHI), which had upbeat earnings on Tuesday, edged higher Thursday morning and is up more than 11% this week.KB Home (KBH) climbed 1.1% to 17.08. KB Home has a 17.48 buy point. Beazer Homes (BZH) advanced 2.4% to 14.57, as it moves toward a 15.90 potential entry.The new-home sales report reported that the median sales price of a new house increased 7.9% from December 2015 to $322,500.New-home sales, which account for about 10% of the residential market, are tabulated when contracts are signed. That makes them a timelier barometer than transactions on existing homes.Sales of previously-owned homes declined in December while closing the strongest year since 2006, National Association of Realtors data showed Tuesday. Contract closings, which reflect signings made a month or two earlier, fell 2.8% to a 5.49 million annual rate, as inventory declined to the lowest since 1999.

Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBroadcom (AVGO) popped in extended trading after the chipmaker said it would buy back up to $12 billion of its stock. Broadcom has been struggling for months, with President Trump blocking its bid for fellow Apple iPhone chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM) on national security grounds. Beaten-down Qualcomm also was up overnight on fresh takeover buzz.But investors may want to take a look at Intel (INTC) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM). Both are consolidating well as the stock market rallies.Broadcom was not yet active Friday morning but jumped 4.2% in late trade. That would push the chipmaker above its 50-day moving average and closer to its 200-day line. Technically, the stock is in a consolidation going back to late November, but it hasn't really broken a downtrend.Shares fell late last year as Broadcom mounted a hostile takeover offer for Qualcomm. Both are Apple chipmakers. But the Trump administration blocked the deal on national security grounds, in part on fears that the penny-pinching Broadcom would cut R&D spending, imperiling the U.S. lead in wireless technology.As for Qualcomm, shares plunged after the Broadcom bid collapsed. The stock rose 2.7% in the premarket on a report that ex-Qualcomm Chairman Paul Jacobs is assembling a group to make a go-private takeover offer.Intel rose 3.2% to 52.72 on Thursday, the highest close since September 2000. The relative strength line is at a six-year high, signaling outperformance vs. the S&P 500. Intel still hasn't topped a 53.78 intraday high set on March 13. If the chip giant can consolidate below that level through Friday, it will finish a five-week flat base. That would give it a 53.88 entry.Intel tumbled on April 2 on a report that Apple is developing its own chips for Mac computers that would replace Intel processors. But the stock found support at the 50-day line and soon moved higher.As for Apple, the stock rose 1% to 174.14, rising a little further above its 50-day line. It's also working on a short consolidation. Its RS line is near recent highs, but hasn't made much progress for the past 11 months.Taiwan Semiconductor climbed 1.1% to 43.85 on Thursday, moving back above its 50-day moving average. The world's largest chip foundry, Taiwan Semi is in a consolidation with a 46.67 entry.The RS line is just below a record high.Taiwan Semi was briefly the world's most valuable chipmaker, but Intel has wrested the market crown in recent days.The chip foundry reports earnings on April 19.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:The Big Picture: Stocks Face This ResistanceData Storage Key Link In Emerging Data-Centered Computing CycleASML, Lam Research, Taiwan Semiconductor Kick Off Chip Earnings SeasonTrump's Shocking TPP Flip-Flop Reveals China Tariff Plan Is A DudStock Breakout Specialty Tool: The Relative Strength Line

The company's data-center chip business is likely to grow 15% in calendar 2018.Lam has the most potential earnings upside this quarterly earnings season, Muse said. It is benefiting from continued strong demand for equipment to produce DRAM and Nand memory chips, he said.Meanwhile, memory-chip maker Micron Technology (MU) stock at under $50 ""looks like a steal,"" Muse said. Micron shares fell 1% to 47.96 on Monday.Muse said his other best ideas in chip stocks for this earnings season include graphics-chip maker Nvidia (NVDA) and chip-gear maker ASML Holding (ASML).""The sector continues to benefit from the third wave of compute (AI/big data/automotive), as well as rising silicon intensity that makes each incremental percentage point of bit growth more expensive,"" Muse said in a note to clients. ""The global macro environment remains favorable, led by global synchronized growth and a rising GDP.""Concerns over a trade war with China are a risk for the sector, he said.RELATED:Stock Market Rally Isn't Dead, But This Key Sector's Action Is A Bad SignMicron, Texas Instruments Hit With Sells As Broker Starts CoverageApple Mac Chip Switch's Impact On Intel Overblown, Analysts Say

70,MAC,"X Heady growth in services and wearable devices helped Dow component Apple (AAPL) offset a surprise drop in iPhone sales last quarter, but it wasn't enough to ward off a drop in shares in early trading Wednesday.Late Tuesday, Apple posted mixed fiscal second-quarter results, with earnings per share beating consensus estimates, but sales falling short of views. Apple's typically conservative sales guidance for the current quarter also was below Wall Street's targets.The Cupertino, Calif.-based company earned $2.10 a share, up 11% year over year, on revenue of $52.9 billion, up 5%, in the March quarter. Analysts expected earnings of $2.02 a share and $52.97 billion in sales.One of several tech companies on the Dow Jones industrial average, Apple saw its shares dip 1.2%, near 145.80, in morning trading on the stock market today. On Tuesday, Apple rose 0.6% to 147.51 after hitting a record high of 148.09 intraday.Apple sold 50.76 million iPhones last quarter, but analysts were expecting 52 million. Unit sales dipped 1% year over year.Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook blamed the slowdown in iPhone sales on consumers delaying purchases because of speculation about the next-generation device, the rumored iPhone 8.""We're seeing what we believe to be a pause in purchases of iPhone, which we believe is due to the earlier and much more frequent reports about future iPhones,"" Cook said on a conference call with analysts. ""That part is clearly going on.""IPhone revenue grew 1% in the fiscal second quarter thanks to the popularity of the company's higher-priced iPhone 7 Plus. IPhone sales were $33.25 billion, accounting for 63% of company sales last quarter.IBD'S TAKE: Apple is on IBD's Leaderboard list of actionable stocks with the potential for big gains.Bright spots for Apple last quarter were its fast-growing services and wearables businesses.Services revenue jumped 18% year over year to $7.04 billion. Services is Apple's second-largest business unit and it contributed 13% of company revenue in the second quarter. Services include App Store, iTunes, Apple Music, Apple Pay, iCloud and other offerings.Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said Apple is managing 165 million subscriptions for those as well as third-party services, up 15 million from the first quarter.Wearables include the Apple Watch, Beats headphones and AirPods wireless earbuds. Those devices are lumped into Apple's Other Products division, which saw sales rise 31% from a year ago to $2.87 billion in the March quarter.""When we combine Apple Watch, AirPods, and Beats headphones, our revenue from wearable products in the last four quarters was the size of a Fortune 500 company,"" Cook said. He said Apple isn't coming close to satisfying demand for AirPods.In addition to disappointing iPhone unit sales, though, drags on Apple's second-quarter results included its sales in China and its slumping iPad business. Sales in Greater China, including Hong Kong and Taiwan, fell 14% to $10.73 billion in the March quarter. Apple's iPad tablet sales fell 13% by units to 8.9 million, in line with estimates, and 12% by revenue to $3.9 billion in the second quarter.Apple's Mac computer sales were in line with estimates, rising 4% in units to 4.2 million and 14% in revenue to $5.8 billion last quarter.Apple also raised its quarterly cash dividend and share buyback program. Quarterly dividends went up 10.5% to 63 cents a share, and the company's share repurchase authorization climbed to $210 billion from the $175 billion level announced last year.Well Fargo Securities analyst Maynard Um said Apple's revised capital allocation plan was ""modestly disappointing.""The stock-buyback authorization increase was at the low end of its historical range, while the dividend increase was at the high end of its historical range, Um said.He reiterated his market perform rating on Apple with a valuation range on the stock of 135 to 145.At least six investment banks raised their price targets on Apple stock after the company's second-quarter report: BTIG, Cowen, FBN, Maxim, Mizuho and UBS.Apple ended the March quarter with $256.8 billion in cash and marketable securities. Of that, 93% was banked outside of the U.S.RELATED:Apple Beats Views On Earnings, Comes Up Short On SalesSmartphone Sales Pull Back Before Likely iPhone 8 Tsunami

71,MAC,"X Consumer electronics giant Apple (AAPL) late Tuesday reported fiscal second-quarter earnings that came in ahead of Wall Street projections, but was short on revenue as well as the number of iPhones it sold during the period.The Cupertino, Calif.-based company said earnings per share were $2.10 on revenue of $52.9 billion in its fiscal second quarter, compared with $1.90 EPS and $50.56 billion in sales in the year-earlier quarter. Analysts expected Apple to earn $2.02 a share, up 6% year over year, on sales of $52.97 billion, up 5%, in the March quarter.Shares of Apple fell 1.9% in after-hours trading on the stock market today. During the regular session, Apple rose 0.6% to 147.51. In intraday trading, it reached an all-time high of 148.09.Apple also missed Wall Street's targets for iPhone unit sales in the quarter ended April 1. It sold 50.76 million iPhones last quarter, but analysts were expecting 52 million. Sales of iPad tablets and Mac computers were in-line with views at 8.9 million and 4.2 million units, respectively.The tech icon said its board authorized an increase of $50 billion to the company's program to return capital to shareholders. Under the expanded program, Apple plans to spend a cumulative total of $300 billion of cash by the end of March 2019.As part of the updated program, the share repurchase authorization was raised to $210 billion from the $175 billion level announced last year.Apple also increased its quarterly dividend by 10.5% to 63 cents a share.For the current period, Apple's fiscal third quarter, the company expects sales to rise 5% year over year to $44.5 billion, based on the midpoint of its guidance. That's below what Wall Street was expecting, as analysts estimated Apple would earn $1.62 a share on sales of $45.57 billion in the June quarter.Apple did not give an earnings-per-share target, but said its gross profit margin would be between 37.5% and 38.5%, compared with 38% in the year-ago quarter. Its gross margin in the second quarter was 38.9%, vs. 39.4% in the same period last year.""We are proud to report a strong March quarter, with revenue growth accelerating from the December quarter and continued robust demand for iPhone 7 Plus,"" Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said in a prepared statement. ""We've seen great customer response to both models of the new iPhone 7 Red Special Edition and we're thrilled with the strong momentum of our services business, with our highest revenue ever for a 13-week quarter.""

72,MAC,"In a recent column, I made the case that Americans are fighting the Second Civil War. The deep chasm that has opened up between the left — not liberals, the left — and the rest of the country is so wide and so unbridgeable that there is no other way to describe what is happening. But I noted that at least thus far, unlike the First Civil War, this war is not violent.Unfortunately, there is now reason to believe that violence is coming. In fact, it's already here. But as of now, it's only coming from one direction.Left-wing thugs engage in violence and threats of violence with utter impunity. They shut down speakers at colleges; block highways, bridges and airport terminals; take over college buildings and offices; occupy state capitals; and terrorize individuals at their homes.In order to understand why more violence may be coming, it is essential to understand that left-wing mobs are almost never stopped, arrested or punished. Colleges do nothing to stop them, and civil authorities do nothing to stop them on campuses or anywhere else. Police are reduced to spectators as they watch left-wing gangs loot stores, smash business and car windows, and even take over state capitals (as in Madison, Wisconsin).It's beginning to dawn on many Americans that mayors, police chiefs and college presidents have no interest in stopping this violence. Left-wing officials sympathize with the lawbreakers, and the police, who rarely sympathize with thugs of any ideology, are ordered to do nothing by emasculated police chiefs.Consequently, given the abdication by all these authorities of their role to protect the public, some members of the public will inevitably decide that they will protect themselves and others.This ability of the left to get away with violence is one of the gravest threats to American society in its modern history. Since the Civil War, I can think of only two comparable eruptions of mob violence that authorities allowed. One was when white mobs lynched blacks. The other was the rioting by blacks, such as the Los Angeles riots 25 years ago, and the recent riots in Ferguson, Missouri, and Baltimore, Maryland.Today, authorities in what we once proudly proclaimed the ""Land of the Free and Home of the Brave"" are intimidated to the point of paralysis.And exactly what do they fear? Not violence — they have made peace with left-wing violence. What they fear is the left-wing media. If the Black Lives Matter movement is forcefully prevented from blocking tens of thousands of cars from entering or leaving San Francisco, the police and local authorities will be labeled racist by black leaders, a smear that will then be echoed by The New York Times and rest of the left-wing media.Likewise, if a college president requests enough police to come to a college campus so that a Heather Mac Donald, a Charles Murray or an Ann Coulter can deliver a lecture, some of the student-gangsters engaged in violence might be injured — and that college president will then be pilloried by the mainstream media.Furthermore, left-wing violence doesn't only succeed where it takes place. It succeeds where nothing happens. The left can now shut down places and events just by threatening violence. This is what happened last week in Portland, Oregon. One leftist called in a threat to the 82nd Avenue of Roses Parade, saying that the Republican Party contingent marching in the parade would be beaten up. The business leaders organizing the parade canceled the whole event for the first time in its 10-year history. If they'd had any reason to believe that the police would have adequately protected the marchers in left-wing Portland, one assumes (hopes?) that they would not have canceled the parade.An email sent to parade organizers perfectly summed up the left's dominance of America through violence. It said, ""You have seen how much power we have downtown and that the police cannot stop us from shutting down roads so please consider your decision wisely.""Meanwhile, the press lies about alleged white supremacists in President Trump's administration and an alleged massive surge in anti-Semitism in order to do what the left has done since Lenin: blame others while it alone organizes violence.So, here's a prediction: If college presidents, mayors and police chiefs won't stop left-wing mobs, other Americans will. I hope this doesn't happen, because electing conservative Republicans and not donating money to colleges will be more effective. But it is almost inevitable.Then the left-wing media — the mainstream media — will enter hysteria mode with reports that ""right-wing fascists"" are violently attacking America.And that's when mayors and college presidents will finally order in the police.

75,MAC,"In the same year that Apple (AAPL) opens an edifice to its greatness — a massive new headquarters that looks like a flying saucer — the company faces growing questions about its future and whether it can still surprise and delight customers with exciting new gadgets.Expectations are sky-high that 2017's 10th anniversary iPhone will be something special that unleashes the full potential of the Apple revenue-generating ecosystem.Yet to critics, the iPhone already has peaked. To them, that new HQ might as well be a monument to past accomplishments, funded with billions in profits generated by the iPhone, iPad, iPod and Mac computers, products ushered into the world by Apple's iconic co-founder and CEO, Steve Jobs.In the five years since Jobs died, Apple has introduced only one major new product category — the Apple Watch, which debuted in April 2015. Wall Street analysts consider the product a disappointment so far. Apple has declined to release its smartwatch sales numbers, claiming competitive concerns.For better or worse, Apple today is a smartphone company. It received 63% of its revenue in fiscal 2016 ended Sept. 24 from smartphone sales. Additional revenue comes from the sales of services and accessories connected to its iPhone business.IBD'S TAKE: IBD's research on various aspects of Apple and its stock show a hodgepodge of greens (good), reds (bad) and yellows (so-so). The IBD Stock Checkup gives investors a well-rounded view of how a company is performing. Take a look to see where Apple is going right, and where it's going wrong.But iPhone sales declined last year for the first time ever, during the iPhone 6S cycle. They could fall again this year, during the iPhone 7 cycle. In fiscal 2016, iPhone unit sales declined 8%, while iPhone revenue shrank 12%.Apple has a lot riding on its 11th-generation smartphone due out in fall 2017. The upcoming model, unofficially called the iPhone 8, is the company's 10th-anniversary product and could sport a radical redesign. Analysts predict it will feature a glass sandwich design, borderless OLED display, invisible home button and fast or wireless charging.Bullish Apple analysts say the iPhone 8 could create a ""supercycle"" of upgrade activity after three generations of similar-looking iPhones, and Apple stock rose 10% in 2016. On Jan. 6, the stock touched its first buy point in a while, at 118.12 out of a cup-with-handle base. Apple shares fell 0.19% to 119.02 on the stock market today but remain in a buy zone.But with an expected shortage of OLED displays, Apple is rumored to be coming out with just one model iPhone 8. It likely will round out its smartphone lineup with upgraded ""S"" model versions of its LCD-screen iPhone 7, possibly in three sizes.Apple will face smartphone competition this year from Samsung's new Galaxy S8, Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google Pixel phone and others.While Apple's unit-sales market share is slipping, the company remains the runaway leader in smartphone profits.""In 2017, Apple will continue to dominate the industry in terms of smartphone profits, but it's hard to see a strong case for big revenue growth,"" Patrick Moorhead, an analyst with Moor Insights & Strategy, told IBD.Moorhead says Apple is working hard to make the iPhone 8 special.""Apple will take some risks with the iPhone 8 to hit an anniversary home run, driving an above-average upgrade cycle,"" Moorhead said. ""I can envision a 25% upgrade lift if Apple does an edge-to-edge display, adds an ultrasonic fingerprint reader, eliminates the home button and offers 1 Gbps,"" that is, wireless data speeds of 1 gigabit per second. The current iPhone 7 supports wireless speeds up to 450 megabits per second.While Apple waits for the debut of its iPhone 8, the Cupertino, Calif.-based company is counting on its fast-growing services business, which includes Apple Music, Apple Pay, iCloud and other offerings, to tide it over.Apple CEO Tim Cook is bullish on services and the iOS ecosystem to drive incremental sales and profit growth as well as customer loyalty.It needs services growth because in addition to its declining iPhone sales, Apple also saw declining iPad and Mac computer sales last year.The company was roundly criticized for waiting over a year to update its MacBook Pro notebook computer lineup in November. And delays in updating its Mac Pro desktop computers prompted some observers to wonder if Apple was abandoning the product.Ken Mingis, executive editor of Computerworld, predicted last month that Apple will discontinue its Mac Pro desktop in 2017.""Apple hasn't done anything in three years with the Mac Pro. It's the best technology that 2013 can buy,"" Mingis ranted. ""And if it's supposed to be the top-of-the-line Apple product, the fact that they've neglected it for three years tells me a lot.""Cook took the unusual step of reassuring Apple employees in a Dec. 19 memo that new Mac desktops were on the way.""Some folks in the media have raised the question about whether we're committed to desktops,"" Cook wrote on an employee message board. ""If there's any doubt about that with our teams, let me be very clear: We have great desktops in our roadmap. Nobody should worry about that.""He did not provide specifics on when the new desktops would arrive or whether he was referring to the iMac, the Mac Pro or both.Some on Wall Street are pessimistic about Apple's prospects. In a Nov. 20 research report, Oppenheimer analyst Andrew Uerkwitz predicted that ""Apple is about to embark on a decadelong malaise."" Apple's fortunes are over-reliant on the iPhone, and the company ""lacks the courage to lead the next generation of innovation (AI, cloud-based services, messaging),"" he said.Among the products Apple has been rumored to be working on in recent years are a self-driving electric car (Project Titan), a best-of-cable internet TV service, and a Siri-based digital-butler appliance to compete with Amazon (AMZN) Echo.Tim Bajarin, an analyst with Creative Strategies, expects Apple to put a focus on augmented reality. AR overlays digital information on the real world using smartphones, smartglasses and other devices.""Apple CEO Cook said he believes AR is much more interesting to his company than VR (virtual reality),"" Bajarin told Time magazine. ""I would not be surprised if AR will be a big focus when Apple introduces its next iPhone, likely in the fall of 2017. Expect more non-Apple phones to pack AR as well, likely via Google's Tango tech.""Moorhead, though, doubts that Apple is ready to jump into the emerging AR market yet.""I don't think we'll see any new products for sale (from Apple in 2017) that address growth markets like automotive or augmented reality,"" Moorhead said. ""We may see some discussion of strategy with some product details, but I'm not expecting real products for sale. Apple doesn't beta-test its products on consumers, and automotive and AR just aren't ready.""This year could be a do-or-die year for Apple's ambitions in the autonomous-car market.In October, Bloomberg reported that Apple had scaled back its Project Titan initiative from building its own self-driving electric car to developing autonomous-driving systems that it can supply to automakers.Apple set a deadline of late 2017 to decide whether to move ahead with the project, the news service said.Global Equities Research analyst Trip Chowdhry predicted last month that Apple will shutter its car unit in 2017.The biggest near-term news for Apple investors will involve what changes Apple makes to its annual capital-allocation plan in April. Many Wall Street watchers say Apple will raise its cash dividends and share buybacks significantly if President-elect Donald Trump is able to get corporate tax reforms enacted and makes it easier for U.S. companies to repatriate their overseas cash.RELATED:Apple Looking To Bulk Up With Original ContentApple Fades In PC MarketApple Looks To Bulk Up Product Portfolio With AR Smartglasses

76,MAC,"Tesla Motors (TSLA) has hired two key Apple execs, as CEO Elon Musk digs up talent from what he once deried as a ""Tesla graveyard.""The electric carmaker on Tuesday said it poached Chris Lattner to lead its Autopilot software efforts. Lattner is an 11-year Apple (AAPL) vet who helped create the Swift programming language for app development.""We are very excited that Chris is joining Tesla to lead our Autopilot engineering team and accelerate the future of autonomous driving,"" Tesla said in a blog post Tuesday. Tesla's overall Autopilot chief, Sterling Anderson, has left, Bloomberg reported, citing sources.Meanwhile, Apple Mac design director Matt Casebolt also has joined Tesla, according to his LinkedIn profile. He is now Tesla's senior director of engineering, closures and mechanisms.Tesla CEO Elon Musk in October 2015 famously mocked Apple as a ""Tesla graveyard,"" hiring engineers that the automaker had fired. Musk made that remark to  a German newspaper in response to questions about whether he was concerned that Apple was poaching key Tesla staff for the tech titan's still unofficial ""Project Titan"" car efforts.But Tesla has hired other Apple executives for key positions before, including Doug Field, now its VP for engineering.Tesla uses hardware from Nvidia (NVDA), Bosch and others for its Autopilot, recently ditching Mobileye (MBLY). But it's working to improve its software.Meanwhile Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), via its new standalone autonomous driving unit Waymo, said Sunday at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit that it has developed its own low-cost sensors for self-driving vehicles. Analysts say Alphabet's Waymo may licence its sensors and software to automakers. That follows several autonomous initiatives announced at the recent CES 2017 event in Las Vegas, with Nvidia and Intel (INTC) among those making deals.Nvidia announced new alliances with Audi and Mercedes. Intel bought a stake in mapping firm Here, owned by German automakers.

81,MAC,"The next episode of President Donald Trump's China trade war has two possible storylines, Beijing signaled on Tuesday. Either the two sides negotiate a truce, or China will match Trump tariffs blow for blow. China stepped up its rhetoric Tuesday, with the Trump administration detailing China tariffs.""We will certainly take countermeasures of the same proportion and the same scale, same intensity,"" Cui Tiankai, China's ambassador to the United States, said in a China Global Television Network interview.Despite the tough talk from China, the stock market staged a modest, up-and-down recovery on Tuesday. The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 index both rose more than 1% on the stock market today, while the Nasdaq composite advanced 1%. The Nasdaq led a broad-based sell-off Monday amid growing China trade war concerns and tech-stock weakness, with the S&P 500 undercutting its 200-day moving average.Apple (AAPL), Boeing (BA) and Nike (NKE), all Dow Jones components, are among the companies with the highest dollar-value exposure to China based on total sales. Apple climbed 1% Tuesday. Boeing rose 2.6%. Nike climbed 4%, reclaiming its 50-day line.So far, China's actions have met that standard of matching U.S. tariffs in scale. Over the weekend, Beijing detailed the $3 billion worth of U.S. products that will face tariffs in China. Those products include fresh and dried fruit, wine, pork, and certain steel products.Beijing didn't impose those tariffs in retaliation for the anti-China trade measures Trump announced on March 22, as Wall Street first thought. Rather, China struck a proportional blow against Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs, which largely spared the country.Late Tuesday, the U.S. Trade Representative's office detailed plans for a 25% tariff on some $50 billion in mostly high-tech imports.

83,MAC,"Jonathan Haidt is a member of one of America's smallest fraternities — those who attempt to see beyond their own prejudices. In the left-leaning Chronicle of Higher Education, he notes that ""intimidation is the new normal"" on college campuses. The examples are well-known: The shout-down/shutdown of Heather Mac Donald at Claremont McKenna College; the riots sparked by Milo Yiannopoulos at Berkeley; the experience of Charles Murray at Middlebury College, where he and professor Allison Stanger were physically assaulted by a mob. Stanger was sent to the hospital with injuries. She said she feared for her life. Haidt writes:""We are witnessing the emergence of a dangerous new norm for responding to speakers who challenge campus orthodoxy. Anyone offended by the speaker can put out a call on Facebook to bring together students and locals, including 'antifa' (anti-fascist) and black-bloc activists who explicitly endorse the use of violence against racists and fascists. Because of flagrant 'concept creep,' however, almost anyone who is politically right of center can be labeled a racist or a fascist, and the promiscuous use of such labels is now part of the standard operating procedure.""The only word I'd quarrel with is ""new."" America's campuses have been down this road — and worse — before.At San Francisco State, it began with a fire in a dormitory. Hundreds of students awoke to a screaming alarm and rushed from their rooms in bathrobes as smoke and flames rose 30 feet from the roof. That no one was killed or injured was a miracle. The three-alarm fire left the social room of Merced Hall a smoking ruin. The year was 1967. The following year, the campus would be host (and I use that term advisedly) to the longest ""student strike"" in history. Dozens more fires were set, and radical students were able to shut down the entire campus for four months (there was even an attempted bombing). The college administration, in the face of law breaking, beatings and intimidation by radical students, backed off like cowards.Dr. Thomas Sowell was a professor at Cornell University in 1969 when bands of armed black militant students forced visiting parents out of a campus building and then ""occupied"" it until their demands were met. Sowell wrote:""The armed occupation of Willard Straight Hall was about reprimands — mere reprimands — received by some members of the Afro-American Society for previous disruptions and violence on campus. It was a demand for exemption from the authority of a duly constituted faculty-student disciplinary body that had dared to slap them on the wrist. Apparently existing de facto double standards were not enough, though such double standards were so well established that, when a parent, evicted from William Straight Hall by the students taking it over, phoned campus security, the first question he was asked was whether the students who had evicted him were white or black. When he said they were black, (he) 'was told that there was nothing that could be done.'""At Columbia University, students took faculty members hostage, occupied the office of the university president (David Shapiro was photographed smoking a cigar in the president's chair) and took control of Hamilton Hall. Radicals shut down the entire campus and then battled the police, with one student permanently disabling a police officer by breaking his back when he leaped onto him from a second-story window. And yet the administration and large numbers of faculty, rather than denounce the student thugs, praised and flattered them. University presidents from Yale (Kingman Brewster), Columbia (Grayson Kirk) and Cornell (James Perkins), among countless others, responded with pusillanimity to the radicals' absurd demands and tactics.But not at San Francisco State. Two presidents in quick succession had resigned rather than confront the students who were disrupting campus and committing violent crimes. And then came a third. A seemingly unprepossessing professor of semantics named S.I. Hayakawa was appointed acting president. As the radicals were chanting, drum beating and refusing to disperse, he jumped up on one of the sound trucks and pulled the plug on their speakers.Instantly, he became a national hero, a celebrity status he was able to parlay into a seat in the U.S. Senate from California.Hayakawa had no trouble rejecting the cant and cowardice all around him. Asked why, being of Japanese extraction, he didn't side with minorities, he said he certainly did, but the radical activists did not speak for the majority of blacks or anyone else. They were media creations, he said, adding that TV news suffers from an excess of ""show business values.""There's an opportunity awaiting someone, anyone, on today's campuses, too. Stand up to the social-justice warriors, tell the truth, and you may find yourself a household name.RELATED:Your Tax Dollars At Work: Subsidizing Elite Colleges That Produce Intolerant Bigots

84,MAC,"XMcDonald's (MCD) on Tuesday said it would expand its delivery service with UberEats from Florida into a number of U.S. cities this quarter, and the burger giant said its new digitized store setup prompted some restaurants to shift employees toward more ""hospitality""-focused roles to help consumers navigate self-order kiosks and other departures from fast-food traditions.That comment, made during McDonald's conference call, followed first-quarter financials that Wall Street cheered. Earnings per share rose 18% to $1.47, beating analyst estimates for $1.33. Revenue fell 4% to $5.676 billion, above forecasts for $5.53 billion. U.S. same-store sales rose 1.7%, better than views for a 0.8% decline. Globally, same-store sales rose 4%, topping Wall Street's outlook for 1.3% growth.Shares soared 5.55% to 141.70 in the stock market today, hitting a record high intraday. The stock has risen for seven straight sessions and is now extended from a 130.10 buy point. Burger King parent Restaurant Brands International (QSR) rose 1.5% to 58.48, peeking out past a flat base with a 58.08 buy point.Management admitted there was some degree of ""nervousness"" among franchisees to plow money into adopting the new store layout, which the company calls Experience of the Future. Those restaurants will have digital ordering kiosks and table service.But the restaurant and retail sectors are trying to meet more sophisticated consumer tastes and adapt to the mobile devices that have reshaped the way people shop and get around.IBD'S TAKE: Despite McDonald's efforts at reform, many people still believe they're serving straight-up garbage. However, the company has remained in good standing among teenagers, according to a recent Piper Jaffray survey. For more about what companies resonate with teenagers, read this story.CEO Steve Easterbrook said the company had a detailed training plan for the shift to that new format, and said ""I think the excitement exceeds the nervousness by quite some way.""As more people turn to the internet for takeout, McDonald's said it would launch a mobile order and pay platform in thousands of restaurants by the end of this year. And by the middle of next year, the company will also serve fresh-beef, cooked-when-ordered Quarter Pounders in most of its restaurants, an attempt to keep up with the growing popularity of fresher ingredients.Along those lines, McDonald's on Tuesday said it would also bring Signature Crafted Sandwiches to U.S. restaurants next week.McDonald's noted that in early trials of fresh Quarter Pounders, drive-thru service slowed slightly. But Easterbrook said the company had found ways around that issue, along with ways to simplify the handling, packaging and storing of the food. He said he anticipates minimal cost increases from the rollout.""We have worked through a lot of the kinks in this,"" Easterbrook said.Management credited the Q1 U.S. sales boost to expanded All-Day Breakfast offerings as well as Big Mac and beverage promotions, and attributed international strength to the start of All-Day Breakfast in Canada.""Our efforts to build a better McDonald's are yielding meaningful results with continued positive momentum and a strong start to 2017 that includes positive comparable sales across all segments, higher global guest counts and enhanced profitability,"" said Easterbrook in a statement earlier.The results arrive as the restaurant industry's sales have suffered from discount battles, harsh or erratic weather, and cheaper groceries, which have given diners more of a reason to eat in.But McDonald's nationwide $1 coffee promotion and new Big Mac sizes — the Grand Mac and the Mac Jr. — cushioned results during Q1. And the management during the call said the price gap between food at home and food away from home was narrowing.Year-over-year comparisons for the fast-food giant could also become more favorable in the second half, analysts say, after the breakfast expansion's boost leveled off in late 2016. McDonald's $1 soda promotion and a $2 promotion for some McCafe drinks could also help in the current quarter.""We attribute the top-line success to high-impact, traffic-driving product news (Mac Jr., dollar coffee) and expect MCD to continue focusing on the value guest to recapture lost traffic to ... peers,"" Stephens analyst Will Slabaugh said in a research note.Wendy's (WEN) and Starbucks (SBUX) could be at some risk as McDonald's tries to balance better quality with value.Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) reports quarterly results after the close Tuesday. Starbucks reports Thursday with its stock in a buy zone.Internationally, McDonald's said that the U.K. ""has not missed a beat since Brexit,"" but said diners in France had become more cautious following a string of terrorist attacks and an election characterized by rising populism on the left and right.The company's decision to sell much of its China and Hong Kong assets could contribute to ""choppiness"" in operating margins over the next few quarters, management said.RELATED:Chipotle Leads 5 Big Earnings Reports Tonight: What To ExpectStarbucks Reports Q2 Earnings Thursday: Watch This Key MetricStarbucks Breaks Out To 1-Year High As 'Unicorn' Tastes Like Victory

Thornberry's district neighbors Fort Worth, where the F-35 factory is located.While Trump has tweeted that ""the F-35 program and cost is out of control,"" Pentagon officials say the plane is now essentially on schedule and close to its budget after earlier problems.

These must be resolved before the aircraft can enter intense combat testing and the eventual deployment later this decade of fully capable combat jets.The Defense Department's F-35 program office ""has no plan to adequately fix and verify hundreds of these deficiencies using flight testing within its currently planned schedule and resources,"" Gilmore wrote. Deploying F-35s ""with capable mission systems is critical to our national security,"" but the program now ""is at high risk of sacrificing essential combat performance,"" he added.The Pentagon's office of independent cost analysis estimates that extending the development phase from its planned test flight completion in September 2017 to as late as into 2020 could cost as much as $1.12 billion more. The number is contained in the testing director's new annual report delivered to Pentagon leaders and lawmakers late Monday.The program office has said completing the phase will require about $530 million extra and acknowledges that it may slip to May 2018.Gilmore's annual report contains a 62-page assessment of the program that's a detailed primer for the incoming administration on deficiencies that include software, weapons accuracy, aircraft-carrier launching, the diagnostic system and reliability.Shares of Lockheed Martin finished trading Tuesday down 0.6% to 256.17.

Probably?Speaking at this year's ICR Conference, management at the burger chain said that it was too early to discuss specific results from a late-night delivery partnership it recently struck with GrubHub rival DoorDash in California. However, the company indicated that a lot of diners not only like their burgers and fries delivered after 11 p.m., they don't necessarily mind if the food loses a little something during its journey to their doorsteps.""Consumers are actually more forgiving when they're ordering burgers and fries at that time of night,"" management said during the presentation.Pizza, by contrast, has long been a delivery item and holds up relatively well. Domino's Pizza (DPZ), which took the lead on mobile ordering, has benefited as people order in.Consumers' growing interest in delivery comes as Jack in the Box has worked over the past year to improve the quality and consumer perception of its core — burgers, fries and soda — which an outside researcher the company hired said was ""really suffering.""""We're a burger player, but still our best-selling product is tacos,"" CEO Lenny Comma said during the presentation. ""So we're a little bit weird in that way.""Many felt Jack in the Box's burgers weren't juicy, that the fries weren't consistently delivered and that the drinks were watered down, the company said. The company said it had changed ingredients for the burgers, tweaked the salting and heating of the fries, added Coca-Cola (KO) Freestyle machines and adjusted the syrup-to-carbonated-water ratio in the soda.Jack in the Box's tacos, beguilingly, have apparently needed no improvement. Some 554 million Jack in the Box tacos, which have been described as ""a wet envelope of cat food"" in the Wall Street Journal, are sold each year.IBD'S TAKE: Jack in the Box isn't the only restaurant chain trying to figure out what new delivery options mean for its business. Domino's Pizza CEO Patrick Doyle said the pizza chain was also closely watching services like GrubHub and Uber Eats. After a year focusing on better ingredients, the company said it would focus on new products this year. As bigger rivals compete more easily on value, Jack in the Box said its sales growth has come from its limited-time offerings and breakfast and late-night items, rather than from discounting.Jack in the Box and DoorDash announced their late-night delivery partnership in October. Under that partnership, food can be delivered as late as 3 a.m.""Unlike the daytime hours and the responsibilities that come with them, we believe that late night should be reserved for doing the things our guests enjoy the most,"" Iwona Alter, Jack in the Box's vice president of marketing, said then. ""Whether you're binge-watching your favorite show or gaming with friends, there's no need to stop the fun just because you're hungry!""Shares of Jack in the Box closed up 2% at 109.99 on the stock market today, and the stock continues to be one of the restaurant industry's stronger performers. Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), which also presented at ICR, jumped 4.9% on strengthening same-store sales trends. Dave & Buster's (PLAY), another ICR presenter today, edged up 0.1%. Domino's Pizza climbed 1.1%.RELATED:California Job Woes, Taco Bell Mean Bad News For Jack In The BoxWhich Booze Stocks Will Get Smoked If Pot Is Legalized?Big Mac Attacks: McDonald's Plots Its Next Strike In Burger WarsMcDonald's 2017 Menu: Table Service, Mobile Ordering, More Kiosks

89,MAC,"The latest iPhone rumor out of Apple's (AAPL) Asian supply chain points to Apple coming out with four new smartphones next year, including handsets with a vertical dual-camera array, as Apple shares neared a buy point Tuesday.Apple is widely expected to release a premium flagship smartphone, likely called the iPhone 8, along with upgraded ""S"" model versions of the current iPhone 7 next fall.Japanese blog Mac Okatara on Tuesday said Apple is looking to add a medium-size handset with a 5-inch screen to its iPhone 7S lineup. It would join the expected 4.7-inch iPhone 7S and 5.5-inch iPhone 7S Plus, new versions of current-size phones.The three iPhone 7S models would sport a vertical dual-camera array, Mac Okatara said.IBD'S TAKE: Apple stock has a middle-of-the-road IBD Composite Rating of 51, but it's been forming a base and has a buy point of 118.79. For more information on Apple stock, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.Apple introduced a dual-lens camera with its iPhone 7 Plus in September as a premium feature to take digital SLR quality photos. The dual cameras are currently aligned horizontally near the top of the phone's rear face.Mac Okatara did not say what the advantage of the vertical dual-camera array would be. It could be a way to encourage users to take horizontal photos.Some analysts speculate that Apple will add the dual-camera setup to all of its smartphones to support planned augmented reality features.The iPhone 8 is expected to feature a glass sandwich design, borderless OLED display, invisible home button and wireless charging.

90,MAC,"U.S. mortgage rates rose, with the 30-year reaching the highest level since April 2014, after the Federal Reserve increased its benchmark lending rate.The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage was 4.3%, up from 4.16% last week, Freddie Mac said in a statement Thursday. The average 15-year rate climbed to 3.52%, the highest since January 2014, from 3.37%, the McLean, Va.-based mortgage financier said.Federal Reserve policy makers last week rose interest rates for the first time this year and projected more increases for 2017 as the economy strengthens. Mortgage rates have shot up since early November, tracking a jump in Treasury yields as investors bet that President-elect Donald Trump's proposals will boost economic growth.""A week after the only rate hike of 2016, the mortgage industry digested the Fed's decision,"" Sean Becketti, Freddie Mac's chief economist, said in the statement. Following Fed Chair Janet Yellen's speech last Wednesday, ""the 10-year Treasury yield rose approximately 10 basis points. The 30-year mortgage rate rose 14 basis points to 4.30%, reaching highs we have not seen since April 2014.""Before the election, the average rate for a 30-year loan had been below 4% all year and was hovering near a record low. The monthly payment on a $300,000 loan has jumped to $1,485 from $1,354 at the start of November.

91,MAC,"The global market for PCs in the first quarter returned to positive territory for the first time in five years, with HP Inc. (HPQ) taking back the top spot from China's Lenovo, says an IDC report issued Wednesday.The report said 60.3 million PCs shipped during the first quarter, up 0.6% from a year ago and just enough to put the ailing market back into positive territory. The market continued along a path of stabilization that began in the latter half of last year, IDC said.HP made the biggest strides, with unit sales up 13% year over year to 13.1 million. That was just ahead of Lenovo, which shipped 12.3 million units, for a gain of 1.7%.Dell Technologies (DVMT), which purchased data storage giant EMC last September, rose 6.2% to 9.57 million units to hold the third spot. Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL), which is in the process of redesigning its Mac Pro computers, came in fourth, with 4.2 million units sold. That amounted to a 4% gain.HP stock hit a two-year high and ended trading up 2.7% to 18.02 on the stock market today.Apple stock was up 0.1% to 141.80. Dell was down 1.9% to 63.90.IBD'S TAKE: HP beat first-quarter expectations thanks to solid personal-computer sales, which led to the stock breaking out of a cup-with-handle formation on Feb. 23. Take a look at stocks hitting new highs.""The traditional PC market has been through a tough phase, with competition from tablets and smartphones as well as lengthening life cycles pushing PC shipments down roughly 30% from a peak in 2011,"" said IDC research manager Jay Chou, in prepared remarks. Nevertheless, he said, users have generally delayed replacing their PCs with other devices.IDC said the commercial market is beginning a replacement cycle that should drive future growth.""Consumer demand will remain under pressure, although growth in segments like PC gaming as well as rising saturation of tablets and smartphones will move the consumer market toward stabilization as well,"" the research firm said.RELATED:Dell Results Bode Well For HP, Intel, Other Legacy Techs

92,MAC,"Shares of Dow Jones industrial average component McDonald's (MCD) cleared a buy point Wednesday, as several other restaurant stocks closed in on their own entries amid JAB's $7.5 billion buyout of Panera Bread (PNRA).The takeover of the fast-casual chain was the latest in the restaurant sector in the last few months. Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants (DRI) announced last week the acquisition of Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen for $780 million in cash. And Burger King parent Restaurant Brands International (QSR), which also owns Tim Hortons, said in late February that it would acquire Popeye's Louisiana Kitchen for around $1.8 billion.Shares of McDonald's closed 0.9% higher at 130.41 on the stock market today, topping a 130.10 buy point, bucking the Dow index's 0.2% retreat, and getting closer to its all-time high of 131.96, reached in May of last year.McDonald's stock had formed a nearly yearlong cup-with-handle base, with shares rising steadily in 2017 as the 50-day moving average crossed above the 200-day line in mid-January, which is generally a bullish technical indicator.Shares of the Big Mac maker also got a bit of a boost after announcing last week that it will offer fresh-beef Quarter Pounders, served cooked to order.IBD'S TAKE: Can a ""golden cross"" be your ticket to profits? When a shorter-term moving average crosses above a longer-term moving average, it can be positive confirmation of an uptrend. (Though it isn't mentioned often in IBD ""because it tends to be late compared to most of our buying rules,"" says markets writer Justin Nielsen. Restaurant Brands rose 0.5% to 56.06, working its way through a flat base with a 58.08 buy point. Jack in the Box (JACK) ended flat at 101.68 vs. a 113.40 buy point, and Wendy's (WEN) rose 1.2% to 13.53, nearing its 14.57 entry.Meanwhile, Cheesecake Factory (CAKE) dipped 0.1% to 63.42, below a 64.51 buy point, and Habit Restaurants (HABT) ended unchanged at 17.45, near an 18.10 entry. Shake Shack (SHAK) fell 2.1%, and BJ's Restaurants (BJRI) was flat.

93,MAC,"After the breakdown of health care reform, both President Trump and the Republican Congress need a W — a win.And not just any win but one that will play into the public demand for faster economic growth, better jobs and higher wages. Recent polls show the nexus of growth, jobs and tax cuts vastly outranks health care.So, most important, middle-class wage earners need a W.We've had job creation, but it hasn't reached all sectors of the population. Consequently, the employment-to-population ratio remains historically low. So does real gross domestic product growth.From 1950 to 2000, growth averaged 3.5% a year. During President Obama's recovery — and, frankly, going back to the year 2000 — growth has hovered at only 2% per year. Real wages have barely improved. New business startups have actually declined. And productivity has flattened.The hole in the center of this tepid growth story is a lack of business investment. It's the missing ingredient. From 1950 to 2000, total business fixed investment averaged a strong 5.3% annual growth. But since 2000, that figure has dropped to only 1.7%.For 50 years, the capital-labor ratio (K/L ratio) increased by an average 3% a year. The capital stock rose 4.3% per year. But since 2009, the K/L ratio has fallen by 0.2% per year, and the capital stock has grown by only 1.5% yearly. This is why productivity and wage gains have been minimal. And the root cause is the lack of business investment.But the GOP can remedy this by providing new tax incentives (including a rollback of costly regulations) right now. Specifically, the new Republican priority should be business tax cuts first.While health care reform simmers on the back burner, the president should go right to business tax reform. It can be nice and simple and easy to understand. There's virtually a bipartisan consensus for it. Separate it out from the broader and far more complex and controversial issues related to individual tax reform.Yes, we desperately need personal-tax simplification. We also need lower tax rates across the board. We need to clamp down on loopholes and unnecessary crony-capitalist deductions to broaden the tax base. But that's a much more difficult and longer battle. Save it for next year.There are hundreds of tax lawyers in Washington, D.C., who can separate out business income from personal income. That will allow legislation to reduce tax rates for the small S-corp companies, as well as limited liability partnerships and proprietorships.So let's end the war on business. Let's reward success, rather than punish it. Congress need only go for a 10% repatriation rate, a 15 to 20% tax rate for large and small businesses, and immediate expensing for new investments.And perhaps to draw in some Democrats, legislators can use part of the roughly $200 billion in repatriation revenues to provide an equity base for an infrastructure fund that is privately owned and run. No new Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. No government directors. Keep it all in the private sector.And forget the crazy border-adjustment tax, or BAT. It would badly damage consumers and the economy, when what we need is faster growth.Meanwhile, don't obsess over various reconciliation rules. Reconciliation can be whatever you want it to be. The so-called Byrd Rule, which stipulates deficit neutrality over the long run, has been broken many times over the past 30 years.And maybe this time the GOP will talk to the Senate parliamentarian. Or perhaps the president of the Senate — Vice President Pence can overrule the parliamentarian.With lower business tax rates and more net business investment to grow the capital stock, the economy is capable of growing over 3% yearly. And that 1 percentage point increase from the 2% baseline would yield, according to the Congressional Budget Office, more than $3 trillion in deficit reduction over the next 10 years.The misbegotten BAT, and its phony $1 trillion pay-for, can be buried in a deep gravesite inside a large crypt.Perhaps the major selling point for business tax cuts is the fact that the biggest beneficiaries are middle-income wage earners, not so-called rich people and rich corporations.Importantly, the best research on this has been done by Kevin Hassett of the American Enterprise Institute and in recent years supported by a number of papers. Ironically, Hassett is slated to be chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisors, as soon as his vetting process is complete. No one makes the case better than Hassett that business tax cuts are a middle-class tax cut.So, with the postponement of health care reform, we now have more than four months before the August recess to give the country the fuel injection it needs: a boost for wage earners, businesses and consumers, productivity and better jobs.Put business tax cuts first. Right now.RELATED:How Trump Can Win On TaxesTrump Needs A Big Win On The Board, Here's How To Get OneTrump's Job One: Cut Taxes To Restore Booming Economic Growth

95,MAC,"Deutsche Bank AG said it reached a $7.2 billion agreement to resolve a years-long U.S. investigation into its dealings in mortgage-backed securities, removing a legal hurdle that fueled investor angst.Deutsche Bank will pay a $3.1 billion civil penalty and provide $4.1 billion in relief to consumers under a settlement in principle with U.S. authorities, which was announced by the Frankfurt-based bank in a statement early Friday. The firm expects pretax charges of about $1.2 billion this quarter because of the fine.While the deal is below the Justice Department's initial request of $14 billion, Germany's biggest lender still faces U.S. investigations into other matters and potentially expensive civil suits. Chief Executive Officer John Cryan has made resolving litigation a priority as he seeks to restore confidence in the lender.""The financial consequences, if any, of the consumer relief are subject to the final terms of the settlement, and are not currently expected to have a material impact on 2016 financial results,"" the bank said.Ahead of Friday’s statement, analysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods had estimated a fine exceeding $9 billion would cause the bank’s capital to fall to dangerous levels requiring action.The bank will publish preliminary 2016 results as scheduled on Feb. 2, it said.Deutsche Bank had set aside 5.9 billion euros ($6.2 billion) for all of its outstanding legal costs as of Sept. 30, when its common equity Tier 1 ratio, a measure of financial strength, stood at 11.1 percent. The bank targets a level of at least 12.5 percent in 2018. Each $1 billion of litigation costs not covered by provisions would lower the ratio by 20-25 basis points, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Arjun Bowry has estimated.In a related case, the Justice Department sued Barclays (BCS) for fraud over its sale of mortgage bonds after the bank balked at paying the amount the government sought in negotiations. The lawsuit announced on Thursday is rare for big banks, which typically settle with the government rather than risk drawn-out litigation and a possible trial.The Obama administration is pressing to wrap up investigations of Wall Street firms for creating and selling the subprime mortgage bonds that fueled the 2008 financial crisis. Authorities have already extracted more than $46 billion in fines from six U.S. financial institutions over their dealings in mortgage-backed securities. Bank of America (BAC), which had the largest such settlement, agreed to pay $16.7 billion over bonds that were worth four times those of Deutsche Bank.Concern about whether Deutsche Bank had enough capital roiled markets and pushed the stock to a record low after it said in September that the U.S. Justice Department had made the opening request of $14 billion and that it had no intention of paying that amount.The consumer relief will include ""loan modifications"" and other assistance to homeowners and borrowers over at least five years, the bank said.The agreement doesn't resolve probes into whether the bank manipulated foreign-currency rates and precious metals prices and whether it facilitated transactions that helped investors illegally transfer billions of dollars out of Russia. Deutsche Bank also faces civil lawsuits related to claims that its traders manipulated key interbank interest rates. It isn't clear how much more wrapping up these cases will cost.Deutsche Bank already has paid more than $9 billion in fines and legal settlements worldwide since the start of 2008, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That includes settlements related to violations of U.S. sanctions, rigging of interest-rate benchmarks and allegations that it defrauded U.S.-backed mortgage issuers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.A slump in earnings, negative interest rates and challenging markets have caused the bank to continue to struggle this year. Cryan's strategy, announced in October 2015, called for cost cuts and the elimination of dividends for two years to preserve capital. Deutsche Bank has said it may not be profitable in 2016 as it focuses on moving past its legal battles.At least four other European banks remain under investigation over the role of their mortgage-backed securities business: Credit Suisse (CS), UBS (UBS), HSBC (HSBC) and Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS). In addition to Bank of America, U.S. banks that have settled include Goldman Sachs (GS), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Morgan Stanley (MS). Wells Fargo (WFC) and Moody's (MCO) have disclosed U.S. investigations into their mortgage-backed securities dealings and have said they're cooperating.

99,MAC,"New-home construction in the U.S. fell more than forecast in November after surging a month earlier to a nine-year high, indicating fitful progress in residential real estate.Residential starts slumped by 18.7% to a 1.09 million annualized rate last month after rising to a 1.34 million pace, Commerce Department data showed Friday. The median projection in a Bloomberg survey called for a 1.23 million pace in November.Even with the decline, homebuilding so far this quarter is running at a faster pace on average than it was in the previous three months and permits for single-family properties rose. While challenged by a recent increase in mortgage rates, limited numbers of skilled workers and shortages of available lots, builder sentiment surged in December on optimism that President-elect Donald Trump will ease regulatory burdens.""The current message is one of optimism that single-family starts are going to continue to gain ground in the months ahead,"" Joshua Shapiro, chief U.S. economist at Maria Fiorini Ramirez in New York, said in a research note before the report. ""Whether recent sharp rises in interest rates have a dampening effect remains to be seen.""Economists' estimates in the Bloomberg survey ranged from 1.13 million to 1.32 million after a previously reported October pace of 1.32 million pace. Starts decreased in all four regions last month.The report showed a wide range for error, with a 90% chance that last month's figure was between a 12% and 25.4% decline.The starts data, while very volatile from month to month, follow other figures indicating steady improvement in residential real estate, including a surge in homebuilder sentiment to the highest since July 2005, according to National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo released Thursday.Permits dropped 4.7% to a 1.2 million annualized rate, reflecting a 13% slide in applications for multifamily dwellings. Permits for one-family homes climbed 0.5%, the fourth straight gain.Construction of single-family houses dropped 4.1% to an 828,000 rate from 863,000 in October.Ground-breaking jumped 27.4% in October, the most since July 1982. Permits, a proxy for future construction, also fell last month on fewer applications to build apartments.During November, groundbreaking on multifamily homes, such as townhouses and apartment buildings, decreased 45.1% to an annual rate of 262,000 after a 76% surge in October. Data on these projects, which typically have led housing starts over the past few years, can be especially fickle.A boost in mortgage rates from historical lows could act as a brake on sales and construction. The average 30-year mortgage rate climbed to 4.16% in the week ended Thursday, the highest since October 2014, according to Freddie Mac data.

Wow, 95%. In statistics we call that a very high level of certainty. But of course, five hours later the woman was in tears, and the 1-in-20 long shot named Donald Trump came in.Throughout the race, the betting odds gave Hillary Clinton an 80% likelihood of winning. That was never the case. This race was always a tossup, with slight odds leaning toward Clinton.

A few years later we had the shale oil and gas revolution, and now the planet is drowning in cheap energy.My point isn't to thumb my nose at people who get it wrong. I've made many predictions that have been wrong, too. But I rarely predict things with the sense of virtual certainty that many ""experts"" do.So this is a plea for humility by the experts and a healthy dose of skepticism from the public. Economists say they can predict what job growth and employment will be next year and five years from now. Budget experts predict what the budget deficit will be in five years. Guess what? They have no idea.The climate change fanatics say that there is no doubt about global warming and its coming catastrophic effects. They say that the science is ""settled."" Of course it's not. How is shutting off debate good for scientific inquiry? How about admitting that you may be wrong?Young people today treat experts as if they are godly. On campuses I always have to tell students, ""Don't believe everything the teachers tell you. A lot of it is false."" As Napoleon Bonaparte once asked: What is history but a fable agreed upon?I spent the early years of my career working for the great myth-buster Julian Simon. Julian challenged almost all of the conventional wisdoms of the 1970s: that the Earth was overpopulated, that we were running out of energy, that food shortages would lead to mass starvation and that air pollution would get worse. He was mostly right, the scientific consensus was often wrong. Yet many of those who have gotten the story consistently wrong still make predictions with absolute certainty.Wisdom is knowing what you don't know, which for all of us, especially the so-called experts, is a lot. This Christmas is a good time to remember that the only person who was ever flawless was hung from a cross.

102,MAC,"McDonald's (MCD) said Thursday it will serve fresh-beef Quarter Pounders, cooked when ordered, in most of its restaurants by the middle of next year, marking the latest move the company has made to keep apace in an industry migrating toward fresher ingredients and mobile technology.The decision follows the chain's plans announced earlier this month to launch a mobile order and pay system. The company is also testing food delivery and plans to expand the number of restaurants that offer table service and self-ordering kiosks.McDonald's shares rose 0.4% to 129.32 on the stock market today, trading just below a 130.10 buy point all month. McDonald's hit an all-time high of 131.96 last May.Burger King parent Restaurant Brands International (QSR) dipped 0.4% to 55.96 but still near a 58.08 entry. Jack in the Box (JACK) edged up 0.8%, and Wendy's (WEN) added 0.7%.As fast-casual dining from Chipotle Mexican Grill (GMG) and others chipped away at sales of fast food's old guard a few years ago, McDonald's in 2015 began a massive turnaround effort that included restructuring the company and refranchising more restaurants, a move that helps shift costs onto independent owners. All-Day Breakfast and other menu items reawakened sales near the end of that year.The company has also pledged to use only cage-free eggs by 2025, and it eliminated artificial preservatives and high-fructose corn syrup from some items while vowing to serve chicken that didn't have antibiotics needed in human medicine.On Thursday, CEO Steve Easterbrook said in a statement that ""we are committed to transforming more aspects of our business, including offering a more modern and enjoyable dining experience, adding new levels of convenience and technology, and making more positive changes to the food we serve.""IBD'S TAKE: Smartphones and voice-controlled devices are likely to play a greater roll in the way people order out. Here's Domino's CEO Patrick Doyle's take on where the industry is headed. The fresh-cooked Quarter Pounders were tested in more than 400 restaurants across the Dallas-Fort Worth region and in Tulsa, Okla. McDonald's first said that it was testing fresh hamburger patties in May.The company said the tests received ""overwhelmingly positive feedback from customers and employees"" and were ""driven by the Franchisees, our region and insights from what our customers are asking for when they visit McDonald's.""But offering freshly cooked hamburgers could mean big adjustments to the way restaurants operate. Margins could also become more of a concern due to the costs of managing fresh food.While fresh Quarter Pounders would mark a move toward the high end, McDonald's has also stepped up its value offerings, including a cheaper coffee promotion and a promotion for $1 sodas and $2 McCafe that starts next month.Chipotle shares rose 2.3% to 444.24, clearing a short flat base to their best level since early June.RELATED:Big Mac Attacks: McDonald's Plots Its Next Strike In Burger WarsJack In The Box Finds A 'Forgiving' Late-Night-Delivery Customer

103,MAC,"In a bitterly partisan Congress, two senators are making a rare push across party lines to solve a persistent riddle with huge implications for the U.S. housing market: What to do with Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FMCC)?Aides to Tennessee Republican Bob Corker and Virginia Democrat Mark Warner have begun meeting with industry groups and former government officials to discuss ideas, according to people familiar with the matter. Senate Banking Committee Chairman Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), whose panel would have to shepherd any bill to overhaul the mortgage finance giants, has also begun to hold housing-finance briefings with the idea of building toward a compromise.A Fannie-Freddie fix, promised since they were seized by regulators in 2008 and sustained with $187.5 billion in Treasury funds, has taken on increased urgency as the companies face the threat of needing more aid. Under the terms of their bailout, they can't retain any capital starting next year, meaning taxpayers would have to cover any losses.Success for Corker and Warner is far from assured. They were behind a failed attempt in 2014 to end the status of Fannie and Freddie as wards of the state. Many Republicans would rather see the companies killed off than have them continue buying mortgages with government backing. And hedge funds that own Fannie and Freddie shares are eager to get access to their billions of dollars in profits, meaning they're highly motivated to try to influence any legislation.""It is incredibly difficult to imagine that any legislative reform of significance is going to be enacted in this Congress,"" said Isaac Boltansky, a policy analyst with Compass Point Research & Trading.A bill is not close, and ultimately Crapo himself could take the lead on legislation. The Trump administration, while calling housing-finance reform a priority, hasn't yet given an indication of what direction it wants to go, and if it takes a strong view, that could upend whatever course lawmakers settle on.""Housing finance reform is a high priority for myself and the American people,"" Crapo said in a statement. The Idaho Republican added that he is working with all members of the committee ""to get the process started to reach a bipartisan solution for our broken housing finance system.""Spokeswomen for Warner and Corker declined to comment.Fannie Mae shares closed up 0.4%, at 2.65, in trading Wednesday on the stock market, while Freddie Mac stock rose 0.8%, to end the day at 2.54.Fannie and Freddie, which back about 40% of the nation's home loans, have been under U.S. control since they suffered significant losses in 2008. They are now profitable again and required to turn all their earnings over to Treasury.The two companies don't make loans themselves, but buy them from lenders, wrap them into securities and sell them to investors with protection against homeowner defaults. They now guarantee more than $4 trillion in mortgage-backed securities and are responsible for setting the standards on about four of every 10 mortgages.The earlier Corker-Warner legislation, which became a bill sponsored by Crapo and then-Banking Committee Chairman Tim Johnson, would have wound down Fannie and Freddie and replaced them with a new system. Critics argued that the bill would have led to higher mortgage rates and didn't do enough to help low-income borrowers. Shareholders, who are engaged in a legal battle with the government over the companies' profits, also opposed the measure because it could have resulted in them getting little value from their investments.Dozens of Banking Committee staffers have begun to get briefings on housing-finance issues over the past few weeks. Among those delivering the briefings are former policymakers who in the past year have released plans for overhauling the system.Most recently, the Mortgage Bankers Association suggested turning Fannie and Freddie into privately-owned utilities with a capped rate of return and strict capital standards. A proposal released last year by authors including former Obama White House officials would merge the two companies into a government-owned corporation. Another plan offered by ex-Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Edward DeMarco and former Corker staffer Michael Bright would make them mutual companies, owned by lenders, that would sell insurance against defaults instead of buying and securitizing mortgages.Bright said lawmaker inquiries have picked up significantly over the past month. He said he doesn't anticipate a near term bill but that the groundwork and teams being formed now could have a big impact on what gets introduced when lawmakers are ready to move.To that end, the plans being briefed do have some attributes in common. Most call for Fannie and Freddie or successors to transfer mortgage-credit risk to the private market. They also would require capital levels far above what the companies had before the crisis.On the other hand, the proposals differ over who should own the companies or what entities should control the process of packaging mortgages into bonds. Fannie and Freddie have sold some mortgage-credit risk to private investors over the past few years, but critics say they have gotten poor prices and that the transfers are less effective than capital would be in protecting the companies against losses.Some shareholders and lawmakers have said that efforts to make wholesale changes to the housing finance system are unnecessary and rife with risk. Investors such as Bill Ackman of Pershing Square Capital Management and Bruce Berkowitz of Fairholme Capital Management, whose stakes could be wiped out if Fannie and Freddie are shut down, have said the current system could remain mostly in place, albeit with greater capital requirements and tighter regulation.One hurdle to reaching agreement on new legislation is solving the riddle of what sunk the last bill. The prospect of losing Fannie's and Freddie's affordable housing mandates brought fierce opposition from some Senate Democrats and progressive-leaning groups. The recent proposals keep the mandates, but some fear the goals would be torn out during the legislative process.Another worry is that a loss leading to the need for more taxpayer money by Fannie or Freddie could trigger a hasty bill that eliminates them, said John Taylor, president of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition.Still, the senators' work could begin to frame the debate. The Trump administration is struggling to fill political positions at the Treasury Department, which is taking the lead on Fannie and Freddie. Craig Phillips, counselor to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, has met several times with authors of some housing-finance proposals over the past few weeks.Mark Calabria, who is chief economist for Vice President Mike Pence, said in a speech last week that the Trump administration has a working group to develop housing finance principles, but no plan is imminent.MORE ABOUT REAL ESTATE:Why 3 of 4 Homebuyers Expect To Be Stressed This YearCities Where Millennials Are Taking Over The Housing MarketHousing Market's Lost Generation Is Finding Its Way HomeAre These The Hottest-Selling Suburbs In U.S.?

104,MAC,"Secular changes in the video game industry continue to batter specialty retailer GameStop (GME), which has diversified into mobile devices, Apple (AAPL) products and pop-culture collectibles to limit its exposure to the traditional packaged game business.GameStop shares were down over 12%, near 21, in afternoon trading on the stock market today, a day after the company reported mixed fiscal fourth-quarter results and gave downbeat earnings guidance for the year ahead. Continuing declines in video game sales were to blame.GameStop stock received one downgrade and at least six price-target cuts after its report for the holiday-sales quarter.Bank of America Merrill Lynch threw in the towel on GameStop, lowering its rating on the stock to neutral from buy, based on a weak game software release lineup this year. Investment banks cutting their price targets on GameStop included Benchmark, CFRA Research, Macquarie Research, Mizuho Securities, Telsey Advisory Group and Wedbush.The Grapevine, Texas-based company earned $2.38 a share excluding items, down 1% year over year, on sales of $3.045 billion, down 14%, in the quarter ended Jan. 28. Analysts expected $2.29 and $3.095 billion.GameStop forecast adjusted earnings of $3.25 a share this year, based on the midpoint of its guidance, compared with Wall Street's target of $3.73. It expects sales to be flat at $8.61 billion for the year.IBD'S TAKE: GameStop stock has a poor IBD Composite Rating of 13, meaning it has been outperformed by 87% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months. For better stocks, check out the IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks or our page titled ""Stocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks.""Benchmark analyst Mike Hickey reiterated his sell rating on GameStop stock in a note Friday.GameStop's core business of physical distribution of game hardware and software is being displaced by e-commerce rivals, mainly Amazon.com (AMZN), and direct-to-consumer digital game downloads, which benefit the game publishers. GameStop also has been hurt as more gamers choose to play games on their smartphones and tablets rather than on dedicated gaming devices.Mizuho Securities analyst San Phan maintained his buy rating on GameStop, but lowered his price target to 27 from 33.""We acknowledge the company faces headwinds with video games, but believe fiscal 2017 may be a trough earnings year as we see a strong catalyst with the Nintendo (NTDOY) Switch (console) and have growing confidence in the company's diversification story,"" Phan said in a report. ""Revenue from nonphysical gaming businesses ended fiscal 2016 representing 37% of operating profit, up from 25% last year, and appear to be on track to reach 50% in fiscal 2019.""In addition to its video game shops, GameStop also sells AT&T (T) products in Spring Mobile and Cricket Wireless stores and Apple products through Simply Mac stores. It operates 1,522 stores in its technology brands segment, compared with more than 7,500 GameStop stores. Plus, it has 86 collectibles stores, including those under the ThinkGeek brand.GameStop Chief Operating Officer Tony Bartel said the company's diversification strategy is starting to pay off.""While we were disappointed with the video game category (in the fourth quarter), we were very happy with our transformation efforts,"" Bartel told IBD.The company's tech brands segment saw adjusted operating earnings rise 216% to $90 million in fiscal 2016. Sales in the division rose 52% to $814 million for the year.Meanwhile, GameStop's digital game sales rose 4% to $1.1 billion last year and collectibles sales rose nearly 60% to $494 million.GameStop's total sales in fiscal 2016 fell 8.1% to $8.61 billion.RELATED:Sears Survival Warning Sets Off These Chain ReactionsMacy's Breaks Support As Amazon, Wal-Mart Squeeze RetailersDepartment Stores Continue To Dive As Investors Doubt Viability Vs.

107,MAC,"Steven Mnuchin, nominated by President-elect Donald Trump to be U.S. Treasury Secretary, said Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac should leave government control and that the incoming administration ""will get it done reasonably fast.""The comments, which came in an interview on Fox Business, sent shares of the mortgage-finance giants soaring in early trading Wednesday. Shares of Fannie Mae (FNMA), or the Federal National Mortgage Association, were catapulted by as much as 29%. Freddie Mac (FMCC), formally known as the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., leapt by as much as 31%.Mnuchin in the interview said that government ownership of the companies displaces private mortgage lending.""We will make sure that when they are restructured, they are absolutely safe and don't get taken over again. But we've got to get them out of government control,"" Mnuchin said.Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been under government control since the 2008 financial crisis. They send nearly all of their profits to the Treasury, and some private shareholders in the companies have been fighting in U.S. courts to get some of the profits, while also trying to persuade policymakers to allow the companies to survive.Perhaps most important for shareholders, Mnuchin did not appear to mimic Republicans who have said that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac should be wound down or eliminated.That stance could bring him in conflict with Republican lawmakers. Rep. Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas, who chairs the House Financial Services Committee, reiterated his desire to pass his own housing-finance reform plan in a speech earlier this month, which would wind down Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac within five years. Sen. Robert Corker, R-Tenn., co-sponsored a bipartisan bill that would also have eliminated the mortgage-finance companies.

108,MAC,"Online shopping through Friday afternoon, brought good cheer to Amazon.com (AMZN) and to the online sales of other retailers, including Target (T) and Wal-Mart (WMT), with Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales data still to come.Black Friday online sales hit $1.17 billion as of 3 p.m. ET, according to Adobe Systems (ADBE). Sales are on track to rise 11.3% vs. a year earlier to $3 billion, according to Adobe Digital Insights, with mobile sales topping $1 billion.Online sales on Thanksgiving Day reached $1.93 billion, up 11.5%, Adobe said. That was slightly lower than the $2 billion expected, which Adobe said was likely due to heavy discounting in the early hours of the holiday and higher-than-expected online revenue the day before Thanksgiving. E-commerce sales on Wednesday totaled $1.57 billion, up 19%, the market tracker said.Adobe said there were record sales via mobile devices, with a record $771 million of the sales coming from mobile devices. Mobile accounted for 57% of visits and 40% of purchases (27% smartphones, 13% tablets). It said conversions in the final hours of shopping Thursday were strong.While consumer spending on tablets is up significantly this year, smartphones continued to increase their share in mobile purchases, driving more than twice as many sales on Thanksgiving Day (27% vs. 22% on Thanksgiving in 2015) than tablets (13% vs 15% in 2015). Adobe said it measures 80% of all online transactions from the top 100 U.S. retailers. It said tablets, TVs, toys and pet care items are seeing much larger discounts than last year, with most promotions coming through search advertising and shopper-helper sites like RetailMeNot (SALE).IBD'S TAKE: Black Friday and Cyber Monday always provide a sales surge for Amazon, but shares are trading about 8% below their all-time high set on Oct. 6, and also below the key 50-day moving average. The stock has been a tech leader much of this year, but it of course is not alone. Check out IBD's Tech Leaders to keep up to date.Amazon said it's on pace to surpass last year's Black Friday in terms of the number of items ordered.

Other hot sellers include the Echo Dot, a compact version of Alexa, and the Amazon Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote.Amazon said other best-selling deals on Black Friday so far include the Instant Pot Multi-Functional Cooker, Hasbro's (HAS) ""Pie Face!"" game, Wemo Switch smart plug (works with Amazon Alexa) and Sennheiser HD 598 Headphones.In just the first few hours of Black Friday, Amazon customers have ordered more than 100,000 toys, it said. Amazon is also getting ready for the shopping week that starts with Cyber Monday, this Monday. Amazon said it will have more than 75,000 deals that week. Last year on Cyber Monday, Amazon customers ordered more than 54 million items worldwide — a record-breaking 629 items per second.Amazon stock rose 25 cents to 780.37 in the shortened session for the stock market today.

Wall Street expects same-store sales to fall 1.3%, according to Consensus Metrix.""Key sales drivers cited by franchisees incl.: (1) expansion of Big Mac platform (launched nationwide in ~late Jan.), (2) $1 drip coffee/$2 McCafe promo and (3) local McPick 2 deals,"" Credit Suisse analyst Jason West wrote in a research note on Friday.He said he believed that McDonald's U.S. same-store sales were ""flattish"" in January, but picked up in February and the first half of this month prior to Winter Storm Stella.That storm, which this week disrupted air travelers' plans, forced some store closures and likely hurt McDonald's sales in parts of the Northeast, West wrote. But its impact on the chain's U.S. same-store sales overall might be only around 15 to 20 basis points for the first quarter.The apparent gains from McDonald's cheaper coffee and drinks deals would come as Starbucks (SBUX) showed signs of losing foot-traffic share in the U.S. in January.McDonald's has said it is testing out food delivery and will launch a mobile order and pay system by the end of the year. It's reported begun testing mobile order and pay  in some markets. That technology is among the biggest breakthroughs for convenience in generations for the restaurant industry.

But volume is light.Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants climbed 1.7% to 76.66, rising to 77.07 intraday.

111,MAC,"Facebook's (FB) Oculus division is looking to get virtual-reality headsets into more homes by way of a significant price drop.The social-media company has cut the price of its flagship Oculus Rift headset to $499 from $599, and lowered the price of the Oculus Touch system, a pair of motion-sensing controllers, to $99 from $199.Facebook bought Oculus for $2 billion in 2014 as part of Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg's plan to use virtual reality to offer richer ways of communicating online. So far, high prices for the hardware have limited adoption to mostly video-game players.Just over 350,000 units were sold in 2016, according to SuperData Research estimates. That's less than rival products from HTC and Sony (SNE). It's also a long way from Zuckerberg's late 2014 goal of 50 million to 100 million units over about a decade, and the more than 1 billion people using Facebook's free social network.""We know that price is definitely one of the concerns,"" said Nate Mitchell, Oculus's product chief, while noting improvements in manufacturing and falling component prices let the company pass savings onto consumers.Like some other virtual-reality devices, the Rift still requires a Windows PC with a powerful graphics processing system. Compatible computers range from about $500 to more than $3,000. Sony's headset, which costs $399, requires a connection to a $350 PlayStation 4 gaming console, while the PC-tied HTC Vive costs $799. Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google and Samsung Electronics offer sub-$100 headsets with less-advanced graphics performance that work with smartphones.Former chief engineer and co-founder of Oculus VR Jack McCauley said Facebook's headset is still too expensive, even for gamers.""When you get above $300, it's really hard to move product in the gaming world,"" he said.Eventually, there will be an Oculus system that doesn't require a separate PC purchase, reducing the cost further.""We see a future where there will be standalone VR devices out there, it's definitely in our long-term vision of ubiquitous VR,"" Mitchell said. Oculus showed off a prototype of such a wireless headset in October, but it gave no concrete release date for such a device.The Oculus Rift system is not currently compatible with Apple's (AAPL) Mac computers, and while Oculus does not have an active team working on this, Mitchell wants Mac support in the long-term.

112,MAC,"A powerful housing trade group is wasting no time in pushing the Trump administration and Republican-led Congress to address one of the last unresolved issues from the financial crisis, outlining a proposal to overhaul mortgage-finance giants Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FMCC).The Mortgage Bankers Association plan released on Jan. 31 would make Fannie and Freddie privately-owned utilities and cap their returns on capital. It would also turn the government's implicit backstop of the companies into an explicit guarantee of the mortgage-backed securities they sell to investors.The group's paper is an attempt to influence any effort President Donald Trump and lawmakers make to reform the U.S. housing-finance system, which crashed in 2008 and has been stuck in limbo under government control ever since. The fates of Fannie and Freddie are crucial to the $10 trillion mortgage market, and to investments in the companies' shares worth billions of dollars.The companies don't make mortgages; they buy them from lenders, wrap them into securities and provide investors guarantees against default. That process frees up capital for lenders to make more mortgages and is often credited with making inexpensive, 30-year fixed-rate mortgages available in the U.S.The government took control of Fannie and Freddie in 2008, eventually injecting them with $187.5 billion in capital to sustain them after the financial crisis. The companies returned to profitability and have paid the government more in dividends than they got in aid. The last major effort to reform the housing-finance system stalled in Congress in 2014.The MBA plan would open the door for private competitors and designate Fannie and Freddie as systemically important financial institutions, a status that would subject them to stringent capital requirements and tough oversight by the Federal Reserve. Fannie and Freddie would have regulated returns on capital, would promote affordable housing and maintain equal access for small lenders.The increased capital requirements would probably result in slightly higher mortgage rates for borrowers, said Michael Fratantoni, the MBA's chief economist, in a call with reporters on the day the association's plan was released. He said it was unclear how much they would rise.The proposal is one of a number of plans authored in the past year. One written by the former director of Fannie's and Freddie's regulator and an ex-Republican Senate staffer, would turn the companies into lender-owned insurers. Another proposal, authored in part by former advisors to Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, would have merged the companies into a government-owned corporation. The idea of turning Fannie and Freddie, also known as government-sponsored enterprises, into utilities has been floated in the past by some shareholders and small lender groups.""The call for the GSEs to be regulated utilities is extremely positive,"" said Glen Corso, who heads the Community Mortgage Lenders of America, a small-lender trade group. ""We've always felt that trying to rip up what we have now and start all over again could lead to a tremendous amount of disruption.""The MBA plan, by creating an explicit government backstop of mortgage securities, would maintain some federal subsidy of the market, which could draw critics. Some Republicans have advocated for severely limiting the government's role and winding down Fannie and Freddie.""It's clear that a discussion within Congress will be a marathon, not a sprint,"" said Bill Killmer, MBA's senior vice president for legislative and political affairs.Steven Mnuchin, Trump's nominee to be Treasury secretary, said at his confirmation hearing last month that he believed Fannie and Freddie remain important to the housing market and that he doesn't support solutions that would put taxpayers at risk or eliminate capital for housing. He said housing-finance reform should be a priority.The proposals over the past year have different structures but carry some similar features, said Jim Parrott, who helped author the proposal to merge Fannie and Freddie into a government corporation.""There is increasing agreement that the government should handle securitization and the catastrophic credit risk and a competitive private market the rest,"" said Parrott, who worked in the Obama White House and is a consultant for financial institutions.The MBA plan leaves some unanswered questions. It doesn't address what to do about current shareholders of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which include hedge funds that are battling in the courts for a share of the companies' profits.The plan also didn't specify how much private capital the guarantors would be required to keep or how much would be charged to guarantors for the explicit government guarantee. In a press release, the MBA said it anticipated releasing a more detailed proposal in April.Some policy analysts remain skeptical that Congress will address housing-finance reform soon. ""It is difficult to imagine how lawmakers will agree on contentious mortgage finance reform issues ranging from affordability to transition with the political discourse on Capitol Hill already signaling delay and discord,"" Compass Point Research & Trading analyst Isaac Boltansky wrote in an email.MORE ABOUT REAL ESTATE:The Most Affordable Major Housing Markets Are In America, Survey SaysAssessing The FHA's Mortgage Fee Cut — If It Ever HappensWhy Are Home-Selling Agreements Suddenly Falling Apart?Homebuyers Pull Back From Overheated Housing Markets

113,MAC,"Video game retailer GameStop (GME) reported mixed third-quarter results late Tuesday, but its earnings beat cheered investors.GameStop stock jumped 8% to 26.04 on the stock market today, moving above the key 50-day support line for the first time in three months.GameStop earned 49 cents a share, down 8% year over year, on sales of $1.96 billion, down 3%, in its fiscal Q3 ended Oct. 29. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters were expecting 47 cents EPS and $1.99 billion in sales. GameStop's results were in line with the lowered guidance it issued on Nov. 2.For the holiday sales quarter, GameStop expects earnings per share of $2.23 to $2.38, down 4% year over year at the midpoint. It sees revenue falling 5%-10% in fiscal Q4.IBD'S TAKE: GameStop has a lowly IBD Composite Rating of 9, meaning it has been outperformed by 91% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months. For better stocks to consider, consult the IBD 50 list of superior growth stocks.GameStop has been hurt by the shift to digital game downloads and increased competition from e-commerce leader Amazon.com (AMZN).GameStop's moves to diversify into technology products and collectibles helped to offset video game sales declines last quarter, Baird analyst Colin Sebastian said in a research report.Grapevine, Texas-based GameStop sells Apple (AAPL) products at its Simply Mac stores and AT&T (T) products at its Spring Mobile and Cricket wireless stores. It also sells pop-culture collectibles through ThinkGeek stores.The company's Tech Brands unit was negatively impacted by the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 recall and low supply of Apple's new iPhone 7 handsets in Q3, Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter said in a report.GameStop shares will be depressed until the company can stabilize its video game business, Pachter said.""We expect GameStop shares to continue to trade at a compressed earnings multiple until it can successfully reverse the decline in its core video game business,"" Pachter said. ""GameStop expects a challenging year-end for the traditional (physical) video game industry. It expects new hardware sales and new software sales to each decline by 15% to 20%.""Activision Blizzard's (ATVI) new shooter game, ""Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare,"" has racked up disappointing sales for GameStop so far, likely because of increased digital downloads, analysts say. On the flip side, Nintendo's (NTDOY) ""Pokemon Sun and Moon,"" released Friday, was the retailer's biggest game launch of the year.RELATED:Activision Gets Price-Target Hike On E-Sports, Game Prospects

The Palo Alto, Calif.-based company earned 36 cents a share excluding items, up 20% year over year, on sales of $12.51 billion, up 2%. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected HP to generate sales of $11.9 billion, down 2%, in Q4.It was HP's first quarter of sales growth since it split from Hewlett-Packard a year ago. That transaction also spawned Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), which edged expectations with its earnings report late Tuesday.But HP's current-quarter EPS guidance disappointed investors.

Sales in its printer and supplies unit fell 8% to $4.56 billion. Notebook PC sales rose 6% to $4.64 billion and accounted for 58% of revenue in the company's personal computer unit last quarter. Desktop and workstation PC sales also grew in Q4. Consumer PC revenue rose 7% for HP last quarter while commercial PC revenue increased 3%.HP management credited its strong PC performance to its focus on targeted segments of the market like premium consumer and gaming PCs.HP's sales of premium consumer PC likely benefited from Apple's (AAPL) delayed notebook refresh, Long said in a research note. And HP's gaming PCs got a boost from a recent graphics card refresh, he said.""We are impressed with the performance, but remain concerned that the broader (PC) market continues to decline and share gains will become increasingly harder to attain,"" Long said.RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani reiterated his sector perform rating on HP and price target of 16.Investor concerns with HP include its struggling printer supplies unit, the potential for PC component shortages and general macro uncertainty, Daryanani said.RELATED:HP Gains On Lenovo In PCs; Apple Mac Sales TumbleApple MacBook Pro Refresh Unlikely To Boost Top Line Much

116,MAC,"Media Bias: President George W. Bush has issued a full-throated defense of the media's role in modern society. He's being way too generous.""I consider the media to be indispensable to democracy. … Power can be very addictive,"" Bush said in remarks on NBC's ""Today.""""We need an independent media to hold people like me to account,"" he said.Yes, we agree wholeheartedly. But he seemed to imply today's media were fulfilling that role. They aren't. And there's no better example than Bush's own two terms in office.While we deeply admire the former president for not holding a grudge, the media spent much of Bush's eight years in office actively lying about what he was doing and what he was trying to do.It's one thing to disagree with Bush on Iraq; even some conservative media outlets loudly criticized Bush's strategy, down to the very presence of U.S. troops in Iraq.But the media consistently mischaracterized Bush's actions, and served as a willing mouthpiece for the ""Bush lied, people died"" mantra of the left that served to undermine the effort to end the Iraq War.Likewise, the media outright lied about what happened during Hurricane Katrina, painting a picture of an out-of-touch, racist chief executive who didn't really care about the deaths of African Americans from the ravaging floodwaters.They virtually ignored the massive rescue and aid effort that followed, while making up stories of savagery on the ground and rape and murder in the temporary storm shelter set up in Houston's Astrodome. Anything to make Bush look bad.Then in 2008, during the election campaign, came the ""Bush did it"" finger pointing about the financial crisis.The Bush administration was on record as early as 2001 warning about the excesses of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, but Democrats in Congress would have none of it, lambasting Bush and other Republicans as heartless tools of Wall Street.The truth is, the financial crisis had been baked in the cake during the Clinton years. Rules pushed by Democrats in the 1990s requiring that banks make mortgage loans to unqualified minority borrowers virtually ensured that a crisis would happen.Instead, the liberal media blamed Wall Street ""greed,"" along with Bush and the Republican Party. And instead of meaningful bank reform, Democrats shoved Dodd-Frank down America's collective throat, leading to a weaker banking industry, the expansion of ""too-big-to-fail"", and eight years of substandard economic and jobs growth.Even today, the media persist in misreporting the financial crisis.What about the brave, independent media during the Obama years? Oh, right. It didn't exist. It was the most pathetic display of overt media bias in modern history.The Obama administration had scandal after scandal — Operation Fast and Furious, the IRS going after conservative groups, wire tapping of media, outright lies about what transpired at Benghazi, the Department of Justice seizing media emails and phone records, the National Security Agency's apparent illegal spying on Americans, the list goes on.But the ""independent"" media stayed mum. Instead, they behaved more like bought-and-paid-for courtiers or sycophantic lickspittles, despite Obama's open contempt for them.At times, the media didn't even pretend. Two classic Newsweek covers from the 2012 election battle between Obama and Mitt Romney tell the tale:""Why Are Obama's Critics So Dumb?"" snarked one cover.""Romney: The Wimp Factor"" said another. Fair and balanced!The media showed no curiosity about Obama's lifetime of close friendships with such questionable characters as communist Frank Marshall Davis, radical-left America-hating Pastor Jeremiah Wright and terrorists Bill Ayers and Bernadine Dohrn.Now along comes Donald Trump, a man the media truly hate. Everything about Trump is fair game, business, taxes, friendships, family, everything.Simply put, the American media have gone completely off the rails when it comes to President Trump. Not surprising, since surveys of the media over the years show they are far left of the population they say they serve.Indeed, they no longer even pretend to be unbiased. After a year in which media representatives were repeatedly found to be colluding with Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, the media couldn't with a straight face claim to be ""objective"" or ""fair"" in any real meaning of those words.As an example, on just one Thursday in mid-October, The Hill reported, ABC, NBC and CBS ran 23 negative stories on Trump, just 1 on Hillary Clinton.Print was no better. The New York Times, the so-called paper of record, ran 11 negative stories on Trump in one day, including one on the sports page. There were none on Hillary, despite an ongoing spate of alarming revelations from WikiLeaks.Fast forward to last Friday. Media outlets were outraged when Trump's Press Secretary Sean Spicer press representatives froze some out of a Q&A session.That was topped off by Trump speaking at CPAC, the annual conservative gathering:""I called the fake news the enemy of the people,"" Trump said. ""They are the enemy of the people, because they have no sources. They just make them up when there are none.""Trump has dared to stand up to the media — his most unforgivable sin.The media need to take a long look in the mirror and address their extreme ideological bias. If not, the media have no one to blame but themselves for being treated as what they are — political partisans with an ideological agenda.RELATED:After Ignoring Scandals For 8 Years Under Obama, The Media Are Now Making Them Up Under TrumpThe Real 'Fake News' Comes From The Mainstream MediaTrump Owes The Media Nothing — Here's Why

119,MAC,"No one knows how the Trump Administration will tackle a major piece of unfinished business from the Obama Administration, the fate of the mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Until that becomes clearer, litigation involving the handling of their eight-year-old conservatorship under the auspices of the federal government will continue to play out in court.Last month, Judge Margaret Sweeney of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims issued a stunning and sweeping rebuke of the federal government's dogged efforts to wall off thousands of documents related to the conservatorship. Her meticulous and painstaking reasoning affirms the broader principle of the public's right to know about government machinations. As she put it ""(t)he 'public's right to know' is a basic (tenet) of our democracy.""By way of background, during the 2008 financial crisis, the federal government placed Fannie and Freddie in a conservatorship under the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA). In 2012, Treasury officials amended the conservatorship and began sweeping all of the profits of the companies into the government's general coffers.Shareholders of Fannie and Freddie objected to what has become known as the Net Worth Sweep and filed suit alleging a taking of property in contravention of the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. To make their case that the government had seized something of value, attorneys for Fairholme Funds had to demonstrate that at the time the government imposed the Net Worth Sweep investors in Fannie and Freddie had a reasonable expectation of profit, i.e., that both companies were expected to reap profits going forward.Fairholme Funds sought discovery to prove that the mortgage giants had rosy, profit-making, futures. While the federal government handed over some documents, it also insisted upon extraordinary secrecy. With respect to tens of thousands of documents, the government sought and received a protective order from the Court. Under the terms of the order, these documents could be reviewed only by the lawyers and could not be seen by the public.Further, the federal government asserted executive privilege over roughly 12,000 documents. This privilege meant that the government would not even turn over these documents to the lawyers for Fairholme Funds. The invocation of privilege on such a massive, unprecedented scale would make it difficult, if not impossible, for investors to make their case that the government had seized their private property.Since George Washington, presidents have sought to keep some correspondence and conversations private to protect matters of national security. In modern times, a Supreme Court ruling on Richard Nixon's efforts to keep his Watergate tapes secret established that executive privilege is hardly sacrosanct. In particular, the interest in confidentiality must be weighed against the right of plaintiffs to prove their case against the government.With this in mind, Judge Sweeney has been methodically peeling away the government's many layers of secrecy. On September 20, she granted plaintiff's motion to compel the government to produce 56 randomly selected documents over which the government had asserted various privileges.Her 80-page order, issued October 3, is as careful as it is devastating. With respect to each and every document, she concluded that the government failed to demonstrate that the privilege applied. She then, for argument's sake, assumed that the government had shown that a privilege was applicable. Even under this assumption, she concluded that the shareholders' right to access the information prevailed as to every document.  Rarely has the government been given such a black eye.Though the opinion formally relates to the 56 documents, it perhaps telegraphs that the thousands of documents sought by the plaintiffs must be handed over. After assuming that the 56 documents were privileged, the Court nonetheless held that the plaintiff's pressing evidentiary needs outweighed the government's wish for secrecy. This logic would seem to hold true for each and every one of the over twelve thousand documents that are supposedly privileged.The ruling also may reverberate in other cases. For over three years, Fannie and Freddie shareholders have been pursuing their rights in courts across the country. One important case lays before a three-judge appellate panel in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. Revelations from the Court of Federal Claims that the Sweep was instituted to expropriate funds from Fannie and Freddie may cause tremors and aftershocks in the Court of Appeals.Finally, the case underscores the drawbacks of executive privilege and secrecy. It is becoming increasingly obvious to all fair-minded observers that the government's indiscriminate invocation of privilege and demands for secrecy are nothing more than attempts to shield dubious government actions from the disinfecting sunshine of publicity.In April, Judge Sweeney strongly hinted that the government was hiding the truth: ""The court will not condone the misuse of a protective order as a shield to insulate public officials from criticism in the way they execute their public duties.""Judge Sweeney's order has such repercussions and is such a repudiation of the executive that the latter recently sought a writ of mandamus from the Court of Appeals of the Federal Circuit. Here's hoping that the Court of Appeals denies this attempt to overturn Judge Sweeney's order. The Court of Appeals should reject the government's renewed attempts to shroud the truth.To be clear, secrecy is often necessary in government. But in this case, there are no matters of national security or foreign affairs, contexts in which claims of privilege have some purchase. We are not talking about military secrets or a list of spies. Rather this case is not about the government's seizure of private property in a manner inconsistent with the Takings Clause and in a method contrary to federal statutes.Judge Sweeney's welcome opinion begins the long-overdue process of ending the government's stonewalling.RELATED:The Myth Of Financial DeregulationGOP Whiffs On Bank Reform, Big TimeWill Gov't Regulation Kill The Housing Market — Again?

123,MAC,"Regulation: One of the biggest myths standing in the way of dismantling the Dodd-Frank law is that it somehow reversed the Republicans' ""deregulation"" of the financial sector in the late 1990s. This is entirely false.Lawmakers are in a desperate tizzy, fearing that the new Congress with a Republican president will get rid of Dodd-Frank, the burdensome bank re-regulation that even its supporters agree isn't really working and that economists have blamed for the slowest economic recovery on record.Typical is this comment from Democrat Sherrod Brown, the ranking member on the Senate Banking Committee: ""If Donald Trump starts doing the bidding of Wall Street, then the voters of Ohio who voted for him will realize that he's joined the Republican establishment here in advocating the billionaire's agenda.""That's a page right out of the Democrats' narrative about the financial crisis, which goes as follows: In the late 1990s, mean Republicans took advantage of an impeachment-weakened President Clinton and passed the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, deregulating the banks and setting off a massive, speculative boom in real estate lending fueled by unbridled Wall Street greed. By 2008, the excesses of these eight years of greed exploded, leaving bankruptcies, mortgage defaults, and ruined balance sheets in their wake.The newly elected Democrats stepped in and, in 2010, passed Dodd-Frank, which reined in the big banks and restored order to the markets.That's the story — the myth.The reality is, the financial sector was re-regulated during the George W. Bush years. That's not an opinion. It's a fact. And well before that, Democrats created the rules — from the Community Reinvestment Act to the creation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac — that led directly to the financial crisis.From the start of 2000 to the 2008 bankruptcy of Lehman Bros., some 7,100 new pages of financial regulations were added to the Federal Register. And Dodd-Frank literally doubled down on that, adding a massive 16,169 new pages of regulations from the time of its passage in 2010 to 2016. There has been no ""deregulation"" at all — just the opposite, it's been a massive re-regulation, as we said.""A deregulated financial system is not what imploded in 2008,"" writes Norbert Michel of the Heritage Foundation, writing on the Daily Signal blog site. ""Financial markets — not just banks — were full of minimum capital rules, liquidity rules, leverage rules, bankruptcy exemptions for derivatives, and the constant threat that regulators would make up new rules.""Nor did those mountains of regulations and the promise of bailouts for badly run firms help ""main street,"" as Democrats like Brown claim. ""Too big to fail"" has never been bigger, and crony capitalist Wall Street investment houses still channel money like mad to politicians. Deregulation? During the 2000s, the banks have never been more under the government's thumb.RELATED:The Out-Of-Control Dodd-Frank Consumer Bureau Gets Its Wings ClippedMemo To The Next President: We Can Grow A Lot FasterTrump Wants To Bring Back Glass Steagall?

124,MAC,"The spike in borrowing costs in response to President-elect Donald Trump's pro-growth agenda is causing some heartburn in America's housing industry. San Diego mortgage broker Shanne Sleder said a third of his clients, many of whom were already stretching budgets to buy homes in pricey Southern California, are having to reconsider what they can afford as rates soar.""With a number of the people we were in the middle of preapproving, as rates are going up, it's getting tighter and tighter qualifying them,"" Sleder said. He's urging them to lock in rates. ""In some cases, the higher rates are making it so they are not as comfortable with the payment.""With investors anticipating faster expansion and inflation from Trump's policies, the yield on the U.S. 10-year note — a bellwether of changes in mortgage rates — has jumped more than 35 basis points since the Nov. 8 presidential election, the biggest three-day increase since 2009. Home loans may be beginning to follow suit: The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage was 3.94%, up from 3.57% last week and the highest since January, Freddie Mac (FMCC) said in a statement Thursday. The average 15-year rate rose to 3.14% from 2.88%, the McLean, Va.-based mortgage-finance company said.A sustained surge in borrowing costs could further hinder first-time purchases at a time when rising values are already hurting affordability and pricing out buyers in many markets. What's more, the backup in rates would leave the economy wanting of a boost from residential construction that's failed to contribute to growth for two consecutive quarters.""It's not helpful at all for the housing market, and it also bears watching in terms of how bad it gets,"" said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James Financial (RJF) in St. Petersburg, Fla. The housing rebound ""could be even more moderate than it has been.""Larry Seay, who retired in March as chief financial officer of builder Meritage Homes (MTH), said rising rates will also limit the ability of developers to raise prices, pinching margins. Buyers will look for smaller, cheaper homes and builders will probably look for opportunities to accommodate them, he said.""It's going to be incumbent on builders to manage cost better because they won't be able to pass on the cost increases with higher home prices,"" Seay said.While mortgage rates remain near historic lows, action in funding markets is reminiscent of the so-called ""taper tantrum"" in 2013. That's when yields surged after then-Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said that the central bank would soon start slowing the pace of bond purchases.In August 2013, after mortgage rates climbed above 4.5%, sales of previously owned homes proceeded to fall nearly 8% by year-end. Existing-home purchases are tallied a month or two after a contract has been signed.An increase in mortgage rates may prove temporary, though, because ""we still have a backdrop of slow global growth, low inflation and an aging populace in most developed markets,"" said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at financial services company Bankrate. ""Those are factors that brought about low rates and kept rates low.""The nation's housing market has been grinding higher, helped by sturdy employment gains, nascent wage growth and attractive borrowing costs. A potential next leg up was first-time buyers. Higher mortgage rates that are sustained, however, would mean less buyer traffic of that segment of the market.""First-time buyers look at the monthly total, at what they can afford, so if the mortgage is eaten up by a higher interest expense then there's less left over for price, for the principal,"" said Tom Simons, a senior economist at Jefferies. ""Buyers will be shopping in a lower price bracket, thus demand could shift a bit.""Home prices are currently rising about 5% on a year-over-year basis. That's kept an index of housing affordability hovering near the lowest level since the end of 2008, according to the National Association of Realtors.Many buyers ""are already stretching to begin with,"" said Sleder, the San Diego broker, who works at West Coast Mortgage. ""If it continues in this direction, it's going to push more and more people out of the market.""""Eventually, if rates go up to where people are not putting offers in any more, sellers are going to lower their market price,"" he said.MORE ABOUT THE HOUSING MARKET:Mortgages Slump While Homebuilder Confidence Climbs, Data ShowWhich Rebounded Higher After The Recession — Home Prices Or Stocks?A Flare-Up In Foreclosures

125,MAC,"McDonald's (MCD) will launch table service nationwide, while introducing mobile ordering and expanding digital kiosks beginning next year, the burger chain said on Thursday.Those plans  are part of McDonald's efforts to become a ""modern, progressive burger company,"" executives told reporters in New York.They would also appear to be in keeping with the company's apparent intent, announced earlier this year, to find a way for staff and technology to coexist — at least for now — even as labor costs rise industrywide.McDonald's currently offers table service at some 500 locations, and jobs will be added for the table service and kiosk assistance, Bloomberg said Thursday. Reuters reported that mobile ordering will be introduced in the U.S. and 10 ""major markets"" next year.IBD'S TAKE: President-elect Donald Trump has put restaurant stocks back on the menu, with Jack In The Box and Dave & Buster's near buy points, joining Darden Restaurants and Papa John's.Technology has increasingly become a part of the dining experience for younger restaurant consumers. Some of those customers have turned away from McDonald's to eat at a growing list so-called better-burger chains — Shake Shack (SHAK), Habit Restaurants (HABT), Five Guys, In-N-Out — that emphasize quality over value and have made it more difficult for McDonald's to balance the two. Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) itself opened its first Tasty Burger location late last month.More restaurants have also eyed technology as a way to compensate for higher wages. Wendy's (WEN) this year said it would make self-ordering kiosks available in its restaurants to offset costs.Meanwhile, digital ordering platforms have helped to make Domino's Pizza (DPZ) and Papa John's (PZZA) outliers in a struggling restaurant sector.Earlier this month, McDonald's also said it was planning a ""very significant acceleration"" in spending on technology, according to Bloomberg.And earlier this year, CEO Steve Easterbrook said that technology like self-ordering kiosks was not ""meant as a labor replacement"" and was unlikely to result in job cuts.""It may change the nature of the jobs in the restaurant, because frankly technology is something that our customers are embracing, whether it's through their phone or whether through self-order kiosks — that is a societal trend,"" he said in May.""We want to adapt to that, but it's not actually meant as a labor replacement. We can just reapportion that labor into more service-orientated roles.""Restaurants in recent months have also struggled to grow sales amid consumers' election-related anxieties, and cheaper groceries have given diners more incentive to eat at home.And McDonald's, which reported strong quarterly results last month, is also approaching some tough comparisons from a year ago, when its launch of All Day Breakfast helped revive lagging sales growth. However, some analysts this year have expressed concern that McDonald's had depended a bit too much on All Day Breakfast to drive sales.McDonald's shares rose 0.2% to 119.45 in the stock market today. Wendy's rose 1.3%, while Shake Shack climbed 0.4%. Habit fell 0.2%, while Chipotle closed flat.RELATED:Big Mac Attacks: McDonald's Plots Its Next Strike In Burger WarsDomino's Earnings Sends Shares Higher, As CEO Sees Industry Mergers

Citing supply chain sources, Mac Otakara said Apple wants to add a glossy white color option for the iPhone 7, MacRumors reported Monday.Apple has had a tough time making enough jet black iPhone 7 handsets to meet demand in part because the production process is complicated. The jet black finish has a deep, high-gloss look, which is accomplished through a nine-step process of anodization and polish.The iPhone 7 series, launched on Sept. 16, comes in five colors. Handsets are available in black, silver, gold and rose gold matte finishes and only jet black for the glossy finish.On a conference call with analysts on Oct. 25, Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said, ""Worldwide demand for iPhone 7 and 7 Plus has significantly outpaced supply, particularly on iPhone 7 Plus.""IBD'S TAKE: Apple stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 65, meaning it has outperformed 65% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months.

128,MAC,"HP Inc. (HPQ) came within a hair's breadth of regaining the PC shipment crown from current leader Lenovo in the third quarter, market research firms IDC and Gartner reported late Tuesday.HP increased its personal computer shipments by 3.3% year over year to 14.4 million units in Q3, IDC said. Lenovo saw its PC shipments decline by 3.2% to 14.5 million units. Lenovo held on to the No. 1 position with 21.3% market share, followed by HP with 21.2%, IDC said. Lenovo took the PC shipment lead from HP in 2013.Gartner estimated that Lenovo had 20.9% market share in Q3, followed by HP with 20.4%.IBD'S TAKE: HP has an above-average IBD Composite Rating of 60, but there are better stocks out there. IBD's Stock Spotlight currently lists 16 stocks with top fundamentals that could be getting ready to break out.Overall PC shipments declined 3.9% year over year to 68 million units, IDC said. Gartner pegged the decline at 5.7%.PC shipments have declined for eight consecutive quarters, the longest slump in the history of the PC industry, Gartner said. The PC market has been negatively impacted by extended lifetimes for PCs and low demand in the consumer segment, especially in emerging markets where mobile devices rule, Gartner analyst Mikako Kitagawa said in a statement.Among the top five PC vendors, Apple (AAPL) posted the biggest drop in PC shipments in Q3, IDC said. Apple Mac shipments declined 13% year over year to 5 million units. The Mac product line is rumored to be in for a product refresh this fall.Dell came in third place for PC shipments in the third quarter, after Lenovo and HP, grabbing 15.8% market share. Apple came in fourth place with 7.4%, followed by Asus with 6.9%.The PC market is consolidating among the top vendors, IDC said. The top three PC vendors took just over 58% of the worldwide market in the third quarter, up from 55% a year ago and 51% in 2014.Q3 PC shipments came in better than expected, IDC analyst Loren Loverde said in a statement. An improving PC market would bode well for PC software leader Microsoft (MSFT) and chipmaker Intel (INTC).""We are very pleased to see some improvement in the market,"" Loverde said. ""Industry efforts to update products to leverage new processors and operating systems, to deliver a better computing experience encompassing more mobile, secure, and faster systems, and to accelerate PC replacements have been critical.""These improvements are accumulating, and set the stage for a stronger market going forward.""RELATED:HP Stock Gets Price-Target Hike Ahead Of Analyst DayIntel Stock Earns Price-Target Hikes On Apple, PC Developments

129,MAC,"The new laptop computers unveiled Thursday by Apple (AAPL) got Mac enthusiasts excited, but the products are unlikely to raise the company's overall sales much since PCs are just a small part of its business now.The new Macs are not going to be a big sales driver for Apple, which gets 60% of its revenue from the iPhone, Wall Street analysts said Friday.""Since Mac is 11% of revenue and 7% of profit, the refresh is unlikely to move the needle"" for Apple, UBS analyst Steven Milunovich said in a report. ""At the least the refresh should stabilize Mac sales which were down 14% (year over year) in fiscal Q4. Mac ownership can be an anchor product for other Apple devices, so maintaining a healthy installed base is important.""Mac unit sales have declined on a year-over-year basis for the last four quarters.IBD'S TAKE: Apple stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 76, meaning it has outperformed 76% of stocks in key metrics over the past year. For more information on Apple stock, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.The new MacBook Pro computers are the company's first updates to the product line in more than a year and a half and the first major redesign in four years. The latest Apple notebooks feature a touchscreen strip called the Touch Bar that replaces the legacy function keys. The function keys have been on computer keyboards for over 45 years.The Touch Bar is a secondary display can be customized by the user and shows different functions and shortcuts depending on the application being used.Another big change with the new MacBook Pro computers is the addition of Touch ID for security and identification. The Touch ID fingerprint reader enables online purchases with the touch of a finger. It also can identify different users of the same PC to launch their personal settings and accounts.The addition of the Touch Bar and Touch ID align Apple's laptop line with the company's iOS products, namely the iPhone and iPad, in terms of functionality, Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster said in a report. He called the new MacBooks a ""solid evolution"" of the company's professional notebook computers.""Macs are well down Apple's priority list these days, behind phones, services, enterprise, etc.,"" Nomura analyst Jeffrey Kvaal said in a report. ""The Mac does, however, hold an emotional resonance well beyond its financial weight, at least for the Apple-philes.""Global Equities Research analyst Trip Chowdhry said demand for the new MacBook Pro computers is ""extremely strong."" The shipping dates for the new Macs grew to four to five weeks from two to three weeks after just a day of online preorders.The new MacBook Pro machines are a ""compelling upgrade,"" Chowdhry said. The Touch Bar could have the same significant impact on the computing industry as the mouse did 40 years ago, Chowdhry said. It will start out as a convenience but become a necessity, he said.He predicted that Apple will sell over 7 million Mac computers each quarter for the next four to eight quarters. In the September quarter, Apple sold 4.9 million Mac computers.But the new notebooks aren't cheap. The 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar and Touch ID starts at $1,799, compared with $1,299 for the previous 13-inch product. Apple also is offering a 13-inch MacBook Pro without the Touch Bar and Touch ID starting at $1,499.A 15-inch version of the new MacBook Pro starts at $2,399, compared with $1,999 for the previous version.Apple's new MacBook Pro computers are thinner and lighter than their predecessors and come with much faster processors. They sport an all-metal body design, a jumbo-size Force Touch trackpad and improved display.Credit Suisse analyst Kulbinder Garcha said the new MacBooks demonstrate Apple's ability to innovate and its penchant for taking risks.Just as Apple challenged the status quo by removing the analog headphone jack from the iPhone 7, it has replaced the legacy function keys on the MacBook Pro with the Touch Bar, he said.

131,MAC,"Apple's (AAPL) smartphone market share by unit shipments is declining, but it continues to dominate where it counts: profits.BMO Capital Markets analyst Tim Long estimates that Apple accounted for 103.6% of smartphone industry operating profits in the third quarter. Its share is over 100% because other vendors lost money in the business, resulting in Apple having more smartphone profit than the industry netted overall. In the year-earlier period, Apple grabbed 90% of smartphone profits, Long said in a research report Thursday.Apple was No. 1 by a mile in smartphone operating profit in Q3. Among major vendors, Samsung was No. 2 in smartphone profits with a tiny 0.9% share, he said. Money-losers in the smartphone business last quarter included LG and HTC, Long said.,IBD'S TAKE: Outside of Apple, the only way for investors to play the smartphone market is to invest in component suppliers. One such company, chipmaker Broadcom, is on the IBD 50 list of top stocks.Samsung ceded market share in smartphone shipments to Apple and Chinese vendors in the third quarter because of its Galaxy Note 7 troubles, Long said. He expects further share loss by Samsung in the current quarter.Apple captured over 100% of smartphone industry profits for the first time, thanks in part to Samsung's weaker results, Long said.Samsung had 21.7% of the smartphone market based on units sold in Q3, followed by Apple (13.2%) and Huawei (9.7%), BMO said.Global smartphone shipments rose 2.1% year over year to 346 million units in Q3, BMO estimates.Long predicts that smartphone unit shipments will grow at a compound annual rate of 2.6% from 2015 to 2019.""Emerging markets will dominate smartphone growth, at 4%, while developed markets will decline less than 1%,"" Long said.On Wednesday, Strategy Analytics reported that Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google Android operating system captured its highest smartphone market share ever in the third quarter.

132,MAC,"Stocks stayed in the doghouse with light to moderate losses in afternoon trading Thursday. Commodities fell. Long U.S. government bonds slipped, sending the 10-year Treasury yield back above 1.80%.Apple (AAPL), meanwhile, backtracked 1.5% to 109.88 in light volume, putting the stock just below its original 110.33 buy point in a new bottoming base that formed from April to September this year.IBD's study of past big stock market winners has shown that up to as many as four out of every 10 of these stocks will drop back to or near the proper buy point, shaking out some weak holders, before resuming the rally.Should traders get back into Apple now? IBD's rule is to wait for strength to return in both the stock and the market, which currently has an outlook of ""Uptrend under pressure"" as noted by IBD's daily Big Picture column.The Nasdaq composite slumped 0.5% in volume running slightly higher than the same time Wednesday, while the S&P 500 eased 0.2% in slower turnover. But large-cap software firm Adobe (ADBE) showed strength, gaining more than 1.6% to 107.55 in a second test of the 50-day moving average.The publishing and digital graphics software giant has gained more than 9% past a 98.10 base on base pattern that it initially cleared on May 24.The Dow Jones industrials were flat. None of the 30 components fell 1 point or more.Dow 30 component Walt Disney (DIS) led the upside, rising more than 1.5% to 93.33 and climbing back above the 50-day moving average. But the entertainment giant still lies below the key long-term 200-day line and has yet to produce any IBD-type bases that could set up a solid breakout. In November 2015, a breakout from a 117.68 cup-with-handle base lost juice after three days of gains, and Disney backtracked all the way down to a 52-week low of 86.25, down 29% from its all-time peak of 122.08.Apple initially broke out Sept. 14, rising 3.5% in triple normal volume in what became its first CAN SLIM-style breakout in more than a year. Since then, reports have generally favored the tech giant, from Samsung's missteps with the Galaxy Note 7 to strong orders for the iPhone 7 reported by some telecom carriers to the company's own report that services revenue continues to rise at strong double-digit pace.However, Apple still faces an overall revenue growth crisis, with sales dipping 13%, 15% and 9% vs. year-ago levels in the past three quarters. Wall Street expects the sales drought to end in the current fiscal first quarter, however; Apple is seen growing revenue in the December-ending quarter by 1.6% to $77.1 billion, then follow that up with an 8.1% top-line gain to $54.7 billion in Q2 (ending in March 2017).Elsewhere in the stock market today, Microsemi (MSCC) blasted more than 15% higher to an all-time high of 48.43 on reports that fellow mixed signal chip expert Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) is approaching the company for a potential acquisition. Microsemi recorded $1.25 billion in revenue in the latest fiscal year ended in September 2015, up 9%, while Skyworks posted $3.26 billion in FY 2015 revenue.Microsemi also sports solid earnings that belie its dull 69 EPS Rating from IBD Stock Checkup. In FY 2015, the Aliso Viejo, Calif., firm earned $2.73 a share, up 25% vs. a year ago and nearly four times the 75 cents it earned per share in FY 2009.

136,MAC,"Speaking on Wednesday in Charlotte, N.C., Donald Trump revived an idea that he had some time ago: Creating a new Glass-Steagall Act for the 21st century as one way to help African-Americans gain access to credit. It's hard to imagine a worse idea for reviving the banking industry and the economy — or for helping African Americans.To be sure, in his speech Trump said a number of things that are absolutely true.""Dodd-Frank has been a disaster, making it harder for small businesses to get the credit they need,"" Trump said.Dead on. He also said this:""The policies of the Clintons brought us the financial recession — through lifting Glass-Steagall, pushing subprime lending, and blocking reforms to Fannie and Freddie. It's time for a 21st century Glass-Steagall and, as part of that, a priority on helping African-American businesses get the credit they need.""Again, all correct — except for the parts that say ""Glass-Steagall.""For those who don't know, Glass-Steagall was first signed into law in 1933, in the depths of the Great Depression. The idea was that banks were in a weakened state, and they shouldn't be gambling with depositors' funds in the stock market. So, by law, the two functions were separated. A bank could do one, but not the other.In 1999, President Clinton, with help from the Republican-controlled Congress, repealed one part of the Glass-Steagall Act: For the first time since the 1930s, the law would allow a bank holding company to own both a commercial bank and an investment bank at the same time, but it still did not permit them to commingle their funds. Commercial banks were still forbidden from underwriting or dealing securities. They still are.This latter point is absolutely key, since it's routinely misreported in the media that Clinton ""repealed"" Glass-Steagall. He did no such thing. It still exists on the books, but in slightly changed form. And Glass-Steagall played no role whatsoever in the financial market meltdown — that's a progressive-left fantasy.Even so, from 2008 on, it became a Democratic Party talking point that Glass-Steagall repeal — or, what some called ""deregulation"" — was the reason for the housing market collapse and subsequent financial market meltdown. And it aided in the 2010 passage of the spectacularly awful Dodd-Frank financial reforms, which many economists now believe are largely to blame for our substandard economic and jobs growth over the past eight years.The myth continued to be fed during the 2015-2016 presidential campaign, with both Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders pushing the idea that Glass-Steagall repeal was a major reason for the financial collapse. This is just plain financial illiteracy.Why would they say something so obviously wrong? The Glass-Steagall narrative served the Democrats' purposes to suggest that something the Republicans had a hand in — financial deregulation and Glass-Steagall's partial reform — was the real cause of the financial crisis. Sorry, but to use an old economics term, that's bull.Peter Wallison understands perhaps better than any living person what happened before the 2008 financial crisis. Now a fellow with the American Enterprise Institute, Wallison was a member of the government's official commission that investigated the financial crisis, and has spent countless hours researching the topic. His book about the crisis, ""Hidden in Plain Sight,"" is required reading for anyone who wants to know what really happened.What does he say? ""There is no evidence that any bank or bank holding company (that is, a firm that owns a bank) got into trouble because of an affiliation with a securities firm,"" Wallison wrote. ""The losses that banks and bank holding companies suffered in the financial crisis were the result of what had always been standard banking activity.""Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch and Lehman Brothers got in trouble because they had been prodded by the federal government — starting with President Clinton — to both underwrite and purchase mortgage-backed securities to fund more mortgage lending than was prudent. With Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as their market enforcers, the federal government stepped in and forced commercial mortgage lenders to finance subprime loans to poor and minority households, often with bad credit histories.Why did they do something that could come back to hurt them? Banks that refused to play along feared that politicized regulators might deny their request to merge with another bank — or to expand their branch network.Fearing an inflation surge, the Fed kept raising rates all the way through 2006. As home prices plunged, the value of the collateral backing hundreds of billions in loans made to bad credit risks collapsed. That left investment banks, commercial banks, and mortgage companies with massive losses on loans and mortgage-backed securities.Too much regulation and too many bureaucrats making bad decisions for banks — based on political factors instead of market conditions. That, not some mythical ""repeal"" of Glass-Steagall, is how the financial crisis happened. Indeed, it could be argued that the 1999 Glass-Steagall reform, by helping to diversify bank holding companies' assets, might have kept the crisis from being worse than it was.It would be nice to think that this is a political salvo by Donald Trump against the far left, an attempt to steal some of Hillary's thunder just a week and a half before the election. If not, it would be a very bad idea indeed to bring back Glass-Steagall as it was.RELATED:Sorry, Hillary, You And Bill — Not Tax Cuts — Caused The Financial Crisis Happy Birthday Dodd-Frank Law — Now Please Kill ItDodd-Frank Could Make A Financial Crisis More LikelyDodd-Frank's Failure Confirmed

137,MAC,"Apple (AAPL) once again released quarterly financial results without disclosing how many smartwatches it sold in the period.The Cupertino, Calif.-based consumer electronics giant details how many iPhones, iPads and Mac computers it sells, but not the Apple Watch. It combines Apple Watch results in its catch-all ""Other Products"" category, which also includes iPod, Apple TV, Beats headphones and other accessories.Apple late Tuesday said revenue in its Other Products category fell 22% year over year to $2.73 billion in its fiscal fourth quarter ended Sept. 24. The period included just nine days of sales of Apple's second-generation smartwatch, the Apple Watch Series 2, which came out on Sept. 16.Wall Street analysts parsed the data and tried to determine how many watches Apple sold in its September quarter. Based on 10 analysts who estimated Apple Watch sales, the consensus is that Apple sold 2 million units in fiscal Q4.IBD'S TAKE: Apple stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 78, meaning it has outperformed 78% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months. But IBD believes there are stocks with greater potential for big gains for investors to consider. IBD's Leaderboard features a select group of such stocks.Baird was the outlier on the high side, estimating that Apple sold 2.9 million watches last quarter. Deutsche Bank and UBS had the lowest estimates at 1.1 million units.On Monday, research firm IDC estimated that Apple shipped 1.1 million smartwatches in the calendar third quarter. IDC tracks shipments, not sales, and had one more week in its figures than Apple's fiscal Q4.The IDC report had Apple in first place for smartwatch shipments with 41.3% market share, followed by Garmin (GRMN) (20.5%), Samsung (14.4%) and Lenovo (3.4%).In July, after Apple announced June quarter earnings, the consensus on Wall Street was that Apple would sell 2.4 million smartwatches in the September quarter.At least eight analysts made estimates for Apple Watch sales in the December quarter. The consensus among those analysts is that Apple will sell 4.7 million smartwatches in the holiday sales quarter.Apple stock fell 2.3% Wednesday on its mixed fiscal Q4 results.On a conference call with analysts Tuesday, Apple CEO Tim Cook said he is happy with sales of the Apple Watch Series 2 so far.""We're also off to a great start with Apple Watch Series 2, the next generation of the world's most popular smartwatch, packed with new features including built-in GPS, water resistance, a dramatically brighter display and a powerful dual-core processor,"" Cook said.

Plus, Apple's 10th-generation smartphone has been supply-constrained.Apple sold 45.5 million iPhones, 4.9 million Mac computers and 9.3 million iPads in the period.

139,MAC,"Apple (AAPL) edged past earnings views after the close, but shares fell modest. In addition to the iPhone maker, fast-casual restaurants Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) and Panera Bread (PNRA) and highly rated Edwards Lifesciences (EW) have reported. Panera earnings and sales topped, but Chipotle did even worse than expected. Edwards Life fell sharply on its sales miss and weak guidance.Here are the details.Estimates: Fiscal Q4 EPS down 16% to $1.65; revenue down 9% to $46.94 billion. Analysts expected Apple to sell 45 million iPhones, 5 million Mac computers, and 9 million iPads.Prior Quarter: Q3 EPS fell 23% to $1.42 as revenue sank 15% to $42.36 billion.Results: Q4 EPS of $1.67 on revenue of $46.9 billion. Apple shipped 45.5 million iPhones, 4.89 million Macs and 9.27 million iPads. Services revenue climbed 24% to $6.3 billion.Outlook: Apple ses fiscal Q1 of $76 billion to $78 billion vs. estimates of about $75 billion. That would be a modest gain vs. $75.87 billion a year earlier.Stock: Apple shares fell nearly 3% in after-hours action to 115, signaling a move below an alternate buy point of 116.28. Shares closed up 0.5% to 118.25 on the stock market today, the best close since early December 2015. Shares have rallied in recent months in anticipation that the worst was over and that the Apple iPhone 7, launched Sept. 16, will do better than expected. Samsung's cancellation of its Galaxy Note 7 phone after reports of explosions should help the iPhone. Apple cleared a 110.33 buy point on Sept. 14 and continued to move higher. Apple then topped an alternate buy point of 116.28 earlier this month.On Thursday, Apple unveils its latest Mac notebook and desktop computers.RELATED:Apple Earnings After The Close: What To ExpectIBD'S TAKE: Buying stocks in the current choppy market environment is risky, but especially so during earnings season.

Sales expanded 23% to $759.3 million, with the gain accelerating for a third straight quarter.Stock: Edwards Lifesciences fell 13% in after-hours action to 99 after tumbling 20% or more. Edwards closed down 2.9% to 113.65 after sinkng just below its 50-day line on Monday.The stock has been extended from a 107.66 buy point.

Revenue down nearly 11% to $1.088 billion.Results: Chipotle earned 27 cents a share, down 94%. Revenue fell nearly 15% to $1.04 billion, as same-store sales fell 21.9%.Outlook: Chipotle sees Q4 same-store sales down in the low single digits, helped by easier year-earlier comparisons. It sees 2017 comps in the high-single digits, with EPS of $10. Analysts expected EPS of $9.88.Prior Quarter: EPS tumbled 80% to 87 cents as sales skidded 17% to $998.38 million.Stock: Chipotle initially jumped after hours but reversed to trade down more than 2% to 397. Shares closed down 1.9% to 405.67. The stock has been struggling to recover since a wave of food-borne illness outbreaks hit many locations across the country late last year. But the stock actually began selling off a year ago, when Chipotle reported slowing growth. Shares have moved sideways in recent months, but haven't been above their 200-day line in a year.Chipotle has taken longer than many expected to regain lost customers. A summer rewards program, Chiptopia, was criticized for being both too complex and too generous. And Chipotle is trying to bounce back at a time when restaurants generally are struggling. Menu prices have risen much faster than the cost of cooking your own food, while rising labor costs further squeeze chains.RELATED:Apple, Chipotle, Edwards Life Earnings Due: What To ExpectRobots Could Push 'Fight For 15' Backers Out Of WorkEstimates: EPS up 2% to $1.34.

142,MAC,"Last week, The Wall Street Journal wrote an editorial about YouTube restricting access to 16 videos -- down from 21 -- that were created and posted online by my nonprofit educational organization, Prager University. The subheading read, ""YouTube thinks Dennis Prager's videos may be dangerous."" The Journal said:""Tech giants like Google and Facebook always deny that their platforms favor some viewpoints over others, but then they don't do much to avoid looking censorious. ... Dennis Prager's 'PragerU' puts out free short videos on subjects 'important to understanding American values' -- ranging from the high cost of higher education to the motivations of Islamic State.""The channel has more than 130 million views. ... As you might guess, the mini-seminars do not include violence or sexual content. But more than 15 videos are 'restricted' on YouTube ... This means the clips don't show up for those who have turned on filtering -- say, a parent shielding their children from explicit videos. A YouTube spokesperson told us that the setting is optional and 'based on algorithms that look at a number of factors, including community flagging on videos.'""PragerU started a petition calling for YouTube to remove the restriction, and more than 66,000 people have signed. YouTube is free to set its own standards, but the company is undercutting its claim to be a platform for 'free expression.'""It is a good sign that YouTube's censorship of respectful and utterly nonviolent and nonsexual videos made it to The Wall Street Journal editorial page. It is a very bad sign that it had to. And it is a very bad sign that it made the editorial page of The Wall Street Journal but not that of The New York Times, the Washington Post, the Los Angeles Times or any other mainstream newspaper that still purports to support the classic liberal value of free speech.To understand what YouTube, which is owned by Google, has done, it is necessary to briefly describe what it has restricted access to.Every week, PragerU (the generally used name for Prager University) posts at least one 5-minute video presentation online. These presentations are on just about every subject and are given by important thinkers -- some very well-known, some not.The list includes dozens of professors at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Notre Dame, Princeton, Dayton, Boston College, Stanford, UCLA, Harvard, and West Point, among other universities; a black member of South African Parliament; comedians Adam Carolla and Yakov Smirnoff; two former prime ministers (one of Spain, and one of Denmark); Pulitzer Prize winners George Will, Bret Stephens and Judith Miller; Mike Rowe of ""Dirty Jobs""; Ayaan Hirsi Ali; Arthur Brooks; Jonah Goldberg; Alan Dershowitz; Nicholas Eberstadt; Larry Elder; Steve Forbes; Walter Williams; Christina Hoff Sommers; George Gilder; Victor Davis Hanson; Bjorn Lomborg; Heather Mac Donald; Eric Metaxas; Amity Shlaes; Col. Richard Kemp, former commander of British troops in Afghanistan; and many others. I also present some videos.Any responsible person, left-wing or right-wing, would have to acknowledge that this is a profoundly respectable list of non-bomb-throwing presenters. It's hardly conducive to censorship.YouTube placed restrictions on the following videos.Think of these topics, and consider the list of presenters. Do you see any violent content or sexual content? Do you see anything you wouldn't want your minor child to view? The only possible ""yes"" might be to the video titled ""He Wants You."" Though void of any explicit content, it deals with the subject of men looking at other women yet most still wanting their own wives. It has almost 4 million views and has helped a lot of couples.Obviously, then, the explanation is not that ""algorithms"" catch violence and sex. Rather, YouTube doesn't want effective conservative videos to be posted (each video has at least 1 million views). Does that mean that it has left-wing censors looking for every widely viewed conservative video? If so, it doesn't have to. Left-wing viewers simply flag our videos and others' as inappropriate, and YouTube does the rest.I have never devoted a column to PragerU. But I have done so today because if YouTube gets away with censoring as big a website as PragerU -- after a major editorial is published in The Wall Street Journal, after coverage in the New York Post, The Boston Globe, Fortune, National Review and many other places, and after a petition signed by over 70,000 people (which is on the PragerU website) -- what will happen to other conservative institutions?For the probable answer, see your local university.The question, then, is this: Will Google and YouTube do to the Internet what the left has done to the university?

143,MAC,"A job listing at graphics chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) indicates that the company is developing processors for upcoming Apple (AAPL) products.The listing points to Nvidia getting its chips in future Mac computers, where they haven't been for several generations of machines, Bloomberg and BGR reported. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) currently provides graphics chips for Mac desktop and laptop computers.IBD'S TAKE: Nvidia stock is the top-ranked company in IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Fabless industry group. It also is No. 7 on the IBD 50 list of superior stocks.A job listing for a software engineer at Nvidia said the successful applicant will ""help produce the next revolutionary Apple products,"" Bloomberg reported. The job will require ""working in partnership with Apple"" and writing code that will ""define and shape the future""' of graphics-related software on Macs.Apple is expected to unveil new Mac computers next month. But the Apple-Nvidia products likely won't arrive this year, BGR said.Another area in which Nvidia hopes to dethrone AMD, besides Mac computers, is video game consoles. AMD supplies chips for Microsoft's (MSFT) Xbox One and Sony's (SNE) PlayStation 4 consoles.Nvidia reportedly is providing the main processor for Nintendo's (NTDOY) upcoming NX game console. Nintendo's current Wii U console gets its main processor from IBM (IBM) and a graphics processor from AMD.Graphics chips are increasingly important for new applications such as artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles, virtual reality and ultrarealistic video games.Nvidia provides processors for carmakers Tesla Motors (TSLA) and BMW, among others. Given that Apple is working on automotive technology and perhaps its own vehicle, it would not be surprising to see Nvidia team with Apple on its car project, code-named Titan.Nvidia stock closed up 0.4% at 66.78 in the stock market today, hitting an all-time high for a second straight day.RELATED:Nvidia Unveils Artificial-Intelligence Tech For Baidu Self-Driving CarsApple Car Moving Forward, But Direction And Speed Unknown

149,MAC,"The iPhone 7 was only available for the final two weeks of the third quarter, but it accounted for 43% of Apple's (AAPL) U.S. iPhone sales in Q3, Consumer Intelligence Research Partners reported Thursday.""In a quarter with only two weeks of sales, iPhone 7 and 7 Plus grabbed significant share of iPhones sold,"" Josh Lowitz, CIRP partner and co-founder, said in a statement. ""We attribute this to slow iPhone sales in the weeks leading up to the launch of these two new models, as well as a positive reception for the new 7 and 7 Plus models.""IBD'S TAKE: Apple stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 68, meaning it has outperformed 68% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months. For a list of better-performing stocks, check out the IBD 50.CIRP said the new iPhone 7 and 7 Plus accounted for 43% of total U.S. iPhone sales last quarter, with iPhone 7 at 31% and iPhone 7 Plus at 12%.Meanwhile, the lower-cost iPhone SE, in its first full quarter of availability, had a 9% share of iPhone sales in the U.S. in Q3, CIRP said.

151,MAC,"Ronald McDonald is keeping a low profile until all those creepy clown sightings subside, but McDonald's (MCD) is expected to produce a profit when it reports third-quarter earnings and revenue results on Friday.Analysts forecast per-share profit growing 6% to $1.49, which would mark a sequential deceleration from the previous quarter but the fifth straight quarter of year-to-year earnings gains. Revenue is seen declining 5% to $6.28 billion, however — a potential ninth consecutive quarter of sales tumbles.McDonald's is still a top five brand in young people's minds, according to Piper Jaffray's latest teen survey, although it has slipped in the rankings from No. 3 to No. 5 over the last three years among upper-income teens. With average-income teens, the Big Mac maker fell to No. 3 from No. 2.McDonald's shares lost 1% to 111.25 at the close Tuesday. The stock continues to trade below its 50-day and 200-day lines after breaking support at both key moving averages in late July.Last week, the company said that it expects to incur about $130 million in pretax charges in the third quarter, which comes out to 12 cents a share post-tax, as part of its global general and administrative and refranchising strategy, first announced in November of last year.IBD's TAKE: McDonald's franchisees don't feel great about business, according to a new Nomura survey, which noted that both franchisees' business outlooks and corporate-relations sentiments have declined: ""McDonald's Franchisees Are In A Funk — Like Its Stock.""Restaurant stocks have broadly been declining in recent months, with IBD's Retail-Restaurants group trading below its collective 50-day and 200-day lines.Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) shares edged down 0.1% to 393.36.Domino's Pizza (DPZ) reported earlier Tuesday, handily beating on the top and bottom lines.

153,MAC,"Chipmaker Intel (INTC) is expected to show improved sales and earnings when it reports third-quarter results after the market close Tuesday.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Intel to earn 73 cents a share excluding items, up 14% year over year, on sales of $15.58 billion, up nearly 8%.For the December quarter, Wall Street is modeling for Intel to earn 77 cents a share minus items, up 4%, on sales of $15.86 billion, up 6%.IBD'S TAKE: Intel stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 89, meaning it has outperformed 89% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months. That's good, but there are even better stocks to consider. The IBD 50 list of superior stocks includes seven stocks from the semiconductor industry.Intel stock fell a fraction to 37.29 on the stock market today. Intel shares last month touched a 36.03 buy point out of a flat base, so it remains within buy range.The last time Intel reported quarterly results back on July 20, it was a mixed bag, with Q2 EPS better than views and sales slightly below targets.Intel preannounced better-than-expected results for Q3 on Sept. 16 when it raised its revenue guidance for the September quarter. The chip giant largely credited ""replenishment of PC supply chain inventory,"" but also said it's ""seeing some signs of improving PC demand.""With Intel's Q3 earnings report, analysts will be looking for signs that the improvement in PC demand is sustainable and for strength in the company's data center group.Wall Street also will be looking for information on the impact of Intel's baseband chip win in some models of Apple's (AAPL) iPhone 7 series, RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani said in a research report Monday.RELATED:Intel Inside iPhone 7; Chipmaker Wins Apple BusinessHP Gains On Lenovo In PCs; Apple Mac Sales Tumble

156,MAC,"Beauty spending is up 20% from last year, according to Piper Jaffray's most recent semi-annual teen survey, as makeup and skincare continue to gain wallet share among young women across the country.The results bode well for Ulta Beauty (ULTA), indicated Piper Jaffray analyst Stephanie Wissink in a note. But not so much for Estee Lauder (EL).MAC remains the No. 1 preferred cosmetics brand among both upper- and average-income young women, but its decreasing market share among those groups prompted her to downgrade MAC parent Estee Lauder to neutral.Specialty beauty stores are still on top: LVMH-owned Sephora dominates as the most-preferred beauty destination for affluent young women (41%), followed by Ulta (20%). Among average-income female teens, they're neck and neck, with Ulta at 29% and Sephora at 27%. Both gained share among the latter group.Broadly, teens are dedicating more and more of their allowance to cosmetics and skincare. Among young women, beauty products now occupy 11% of ""wallet share"" -- i.e. the proportion of annual spending on each category, per Piper Jaffray's definition -- up from 8.5% five years ago and 7% a decade ago.IBD'S TAKE: For a look at Amazon's struggle to elbow out specialty beauty retailers like Ulta and Sephora, read: ""Why Amazon Has Been Powerless Against Beauty Stores.""Separately, Wissink raised her estimates on Ulta following its investor day conference on Thursday, as she sees the beauty retailer becoming ""a much larger business with the potential to double earnings.""Piper Jaffray rates the stock overweight with a 290 price goal.Ulta upped its Q3 and full-year guidance Thursday, prompting an 11.4% surge that largely erased the slide that occurred after the company's last quarterly report, which topped expectations but offered slightly light guidance.Shares of Ulta fell 1.3% in the stock market today.

157,MAC,"HP Inc. (HPQ) stock sank on Friday, a day after the PC and printer maker announced plans to cut 3,000 to 4,000 jobs over the next three years and guided to below-consensus earnings and free cash flow for fiscal 2017, which starts Nov. 1.HP stock plunged 4.4% to close at 14.48 on the stock market today.IBD'S TAKE: HP stock has a so-so IBD Composite Rating of 52. It ranks No. 3 out of 16 companies in IBD's Computer-Hardware & Peripherals industry group. To see which company leads the sector, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.At the company's annual analyst meeting on Thursday, HP executives presented their near- and longer-term goals from the company.Based on the midpoint of its guidance, HP expects adjusted earnings per share of $1.60 in fiscal 2017, vs. Wall Street's consensus of $1.61. HP is forecasting free cash flow next year of $2.5 billion, below the Street's target of $2.6 billion.HP raised its dividend by 7% and authorized a $3 billion incremental share-repurchase plan, bringing the total authorized amount to about $4 billion.The planned job cuts will start in fiscal 2017 and run through fiscal 2019. HP expects annual savings of $200 million to $300 million from the restructuring plan starting in fiscal 2020.When HP split from the former Hewlett-Packard nearly a year ago, it had almost 50,000 employees worldwide. But it expected to cut 3,000 jobs in fiscal 2016, which ends Oct. 31.HP CEO Dion Weisler described HP as a ""pillar of stability"" compared with its competition, according to Jefferies analyst James Kisner.""Weisler noted that its competitors are particularly distracted right now; Dell (DVMT) and EMC are merging, Lexmark (LXK) is being sold, Xerox (XRX) may be separating, and Lenovo is distracted with fixing its mobile and server segments,"" Kisner said in a research report. This environment should help HP gain market share, he said.Wall Street gave the HP news generally positive notices. At least four analysts raised their price targets on HP after the event.Kisner maintained his buy rating and 16.75 price target on HP stock.""HP sees fiscal 2017 as a transition year with a focus on stabilizing (its printing supplies business, and) fiscal 2018 is the year to accelerate growth with its key initiatives such as A3 copier and 3D (printing),"" Kisner said. ""We believe HP shares will appreciate as investors gain confidence in an improvement of the trajectory of PCs and printing businesses.""Credit Suisse analyst Kulbinder Garcha reiterated his outperform rating and price target of 19 on HP stock.""HP management laid out a decent case for why the company could return to growth in revenue and EPS long term,"" Garcha said in a report. ""These include a change in business mix within (its PC unit to more premium computers), a model to optimize the supplies for (its) printing installed base, Samsung printer deal, and the optionality of 3D printing. While secular challenges in its end markets remain, we believe the valuation remains compelling.""In the PC market, HP is looking to sell more higher-margin machines, such as detachable tablet-notebooks and gaming PCs, as the overall market remains in the doldrums.In the printer market, HP is trying to find ways to improve ink sales and expand into new markets like commercial copiers and printers.CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino kept his buy rating on HP, but raised his price target to 17 from 15.""We expect printer supplies to remain a headwind in fiscal 2017, but note long-term growth initiatives (copier A3 penetration, commercial mobility and 3D printing),"" he said in a report.While several analysts were upbeat following HP's analyst day, others were from Missouri (the Show Me State) and took a wait-and-see stance.Mizuho Securities analyst Abhey Lamba maintained his neutral rating on HP, but upped his price target to 14 from 12.""We walked away (from HP's analyst meeting) acknowledging management's efforts to stabilize the PC and printing businesses,"" Lamba said in a report. ""However, we continue to see macro and secular challenges in these markets and believe HP's go-to-market and selling initiatives are unlikely to yield results in the near term.""Wells Fargo Securities analyst Maynard Um stuck with his market perform rating on HP, yet raised his valuation range on the stock to $14-$15 from $13-$14.BMO Capital Markets analyst Tim Long said he had ""generally neutral takeaways"" from the analyst day presentations. He reiterated his market perform rating and price target of 13 on HP stock.""Management is executing well on cost reduction and stabilizing the two businesses, but we believe headwinds will continue to dominate the story before the longer-term growth drivers start to contribute,"" Long said in a report.UBS analyst Steven Milunovich maintained his neutral rating on HP, but raised his price target to 15 from 14.""HP manages its business tightly, driving out cost, carefully pursuing profitable share gains in declining markets, and investing in adjacent markets,"" Milunovich said.

159,MAC,"One chapter in Nvidia's (NVDA) rivalry with Intel (INTC) is nearing an end: Royalty payments from Intel that have boosted Nvidia earnings since 2011 could sunset next year — just as more competition unfolds between them in data centers, self-driving cars and augmented reality.Both Intel and Nvidia, whose stock has jumped 103% in 2016 after slipping a fraction on Friday, stick out as chipmakers hunting for the next killer app. Mobile phone sales are slowing globally, much as the PC market did earlier. Intel and Nvidia aim for leadership in semiconductors used in cars, artificial intelligence and visual processing.The moves into new markets are panning out, but Nvidia still gets 60% of revenue from PC graphics and gaming.Intel, which in Q2 derived 54% of its revenue from its PC unit, recently acquired startups in the AI and visual computing fields. Observers wonder what Nvidia might buy, with nearly $5 billion in cash on its balance sheet.But where Intel has had four chief executives since Nvidia was founded in 1993, Nvidia has had one CEO: Jen-Hsun Huang, one of Nvidia's three co-founders. The CEO gets kudos for reinventing Nvidia and for his ability to recruit top engineers to the chipmaker.""Jen-Hsun has made several gutsy calls in the past decade,"" Mark Hung, an analyst at tech research firm Gartner, told IBD. ""Some of them worked out very well, a couple not so much. When he sees an opportunity, he's been able to marshal the company's full resources behind it. In data center and automotive, they're charging ahead.""IBD'S TAKE: Nvidia's big year hasn't just been good for a chip company or for a tech company, but for any company. How good? The IBD 50 ranking of top-performing stocks over the past 52 weeks, with an emphasis on the most recent six months, is always a great place to find winners. Nvidia currently ranks No. 5 on that hard-to-make list.Huang is slated to deliver a preshow keynote address at CES 2017 in January and is expected to trumpet emerging gaming and AI technology, as well as AR headsets and self-driving cars. Its chips already help power the instrument and navigation displays in Tesla Motors (TSLA) e-cars and others.Nvidia continues to improve upon the high-end graphics processing that made it the leader in gaming, along with Advance Micro Devices (AMD). An Nvidia edge is that its powerful graphics processors, thanks to their ""parallel-processing"" circuitry, can be extended to artificial intelligence software.AI chips are well-suited for facial or object recognition, a plus for robotics and security applications, as well as spoken-language apps. Much R&D is focused on ""deep learning,"" an AI tool that enables computers to be trained and to perform actual reasoning. Self-driving cars map their surroundings and detect hazards, for example.In self-driving, Nvidia has ""the right product at the right time,"" said Malcolm Penn, founder and CEO of U.K.-based Future Horizons, a semiconductor research firm. ""Autonomous driving is all about vision and parallel processing,"" and Nvidia products are ""perfect for this; Intel ... is not.""Intel's chips still dominate in low-end PC graphics. And its chips are built into most computer servers packed into data centers. Nvidia's chips are gaining in data center gear as well, with technology well-suited for apps such as credit-card fraud-detection systems, says David Kanter, an analyst at Real World Technologies and the Linley Group.Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOGL), Facebook (FB) and others are racing to develop AI-based apps that can be delivered to consumers via the internet cloud. There's another race underway to equip data centers with AI hardware and software.Intel's August acquisition of startup Nervana Systems heated up its rivalry with Nvidia. Nervana's technology processes ""deep learning"" algorithms. For its part, Intel last month acquired startup Movidius, whose visual processors are used in drones, virtual reality devices and autonomous machines.""Intel has only recently started to focus on machine learning and doesn't offer the same level of performance as Nvidia's latest products,"" Kanter said. ""The Nervana acquisition is an attempt by Intel to get expertise in machine learning and defend its territory in the data center.""For its fiscal Q2 ended July 31, Santa Clara, Calif.-based Nvidia's revenue jumped 24% from the year earlier, easily its best showing in at least four years. EPS ex items jumped 56% to 53 cents, its best showing in two years.But for its fiscal 2018 ending Jan. 31, 2018, analysts polled by Thomson Reuters are modeling only 3% full-year EPS growth. That's where the patent cross-licensing deal signed by Intel and Nvidia in 2011 comes in. Intel agreed to pay Nvidia $1.5 billion over six years, or roughly $264 million annually, to settle a patent dispute.In an email, Intel spokesman William Moss declined to comment on whether Intel plans to renew the agreement. Analysts say Nvidia has indicated there won't be a renewal.Nvidia can make up the Intel loss, says William Stein, a SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst. ""Nvidia's margins will be pressured in the near term for the nearly 90%-margin Intel-licensing revenue rolling off in 2017,"" said Stein in a research report. ""We believe this will be more than offset in the long term by growth in the high-margin data center end-market, plus new products in automotive, lifting margins above the corporate average. Increasing ASPs (average selling prices) in gaming will also help.""Some observers speculate that Nvidia could win back some PC business at Apple, where AMD's chips have recently been built into Mac desktops and laptops.Nvidia and AMD talked merger back in 2005. A deal would have created a bigger rival to Intel. Huang wanted to be CEO of the combined chip company, analysts say, and the deal fell apart.M&A has not been a big part of Nvidia's DNA, though it bought U.K.-based Icera for around $370 million in 2011. Nvidia had problems melding Icera's modem technology with its GPUs and wrote down the Icera business in 2015, says Will Strauss, president of market research firm Forward Concepts. While Nvidia has won some design wins in tablets, it's not a volume player in smartphones.With nearly $5 billion in cash on its balance sheet, Nvidia could be primed for acquisitions, Nomura analyst Romit Shah speculated in a September research report.With a market cap over $13.5 billion, Xilinx (XLNX) could be out of Nvidia's reach, but it's a potentially potent combo. ""Nvidia and Xilinx … now that would change the world as we know it,"" said Penn via email. Intel plucked down $16.7 billion in 2015 to buy top Xilinx rival Altera, which like Xilinx has a sizable data center business.Shah speculates that Nvidia might be interested in IBM's (IBM) Power family of processors. IBM and Nvidia have been partners in AI projects.Nvidia garners just over 10% of revenue from its data center business and, for now, only about 8% from automotive. Besides Tesla, Nvidia works with such automakers as Audi, BMW, Honda (HMC), Mercedes-Benz and Volvo, providing technology for infotainment, navigation, digital instrument clusters and advanced driver-assistance systems.Self-driving cars are one big battleground for Intel and Nvidia. Intel has teamed with autonomous-driving tech company Mobileye (MBLY) and Germany's BMW with the goal of bringing a self-driving car to market by 2021.Nvidia's highest-profile customer and partner might be Tesla Motors (TSLA). (Nvidia, by coincidence, has a line of AI and deep-learning platforms brand-named Tesla, but its Tegra line is what is used inside Tesla and other cars.) In August, Nvidia nabbed another biggie, announcing a partnership with China internet giant Baidu (BIDU) to make an autonomous car platform.Self-driving cars would be a big leap forward technologically for the chipmaker, says Kanter, but he says it's far too early to call Nvidia a winner of the race.""It's not clear to me how well Nvidia's expertise will translate outside of gaming and PCs,"" Kanter said. ""Automotive products are totally different from consumer electronics and the car manufacturers play a much more active role in system integration than a PC (maker) like HP (HPQ) or Dell.""There are many other companies that are more specialized in automotive.""RELATED:Nvidia Debuts AI Supercomputer Chip For Self-Driving CarsNvidia Could Provide Graphics Chips For Apple Mac ComputersIntel Among Chipmakers Getting Vote Of Confidence

160,MAC,"Fads come and go, and it's not a stretch to wonder if the slowdown in McDonald's (MCD) Japan's same-store growth might point to fewer Charizard captures, just months after ""Pokemon Go"" partnered up with the country's Big Mac chain.While Japanese consumers can be especially fickle with their fads, tech trends often begin there before spreading elsewhere.Same-store sales for McDonald's Japan grew 11.5% in September, a deceleration from a 15.9% gain in August and the spectacular 26.6% surge in July, when the game first debuted in Japan.Most McDonald's locations across the country became Pokemon ""gyms"" and game-related hot spots, which boosted McDonald's Japan sales, according to Nikkei reports. The stock also saw a 2.2% boost July 19 when the game went live in Japan, marking its biggest increase in seven months.Even with a mild slowdown last month, that's still a marked difference from the prior year's negative 1.9% in same-store sales, however. McD's in the country were plagued last year by the aftermath of several food-contamination incidents that tainted the Happy Meal maker's image in the country.McDonald's shares edged up 0.45% to 113.92 in the stock market today after falling intraday to their lowest level since November 2015. U.S.-listed shares of Nintendo (NTDOY), which has a stake in game developer Niantic and in Pokemon Co., fell 2.3% to 31.80.Nintendo spiked earlier in the summer on its viral popularity, and popped nearly 29% on Sept. 7 after Apple (AAPL) announced that ""Pokemon Go"" would be coming to the Apple Watch.IBD'S TAKE: Restaurant stocks, including fast-food chains to sit-down establishments, haven't been experiencing the best year. Yum Brands is sinking after a late Thursday Q3 miss.While McDonald's Japan posted but two months of positive comps in 2015 and only one month of positive comps in 2014, this year has seen nothing but hefty double-digit comparable sales.September's growth is the lowest so far in 2016, though it's unclear just how much of that is tied to a fade in ""Pokemon Go"" users frequenting the fast-food chain.Spending per customer also decelerated to 4.1% from 7.9% in August and 15.3% in July. The number of customers that frequented McDonald's Japan in September grew 7.1%.RELATED:Restaurant Stocks Continue To Turn Investors' StomachsOff The Charts: Fast Food Inflation Vs. Eating In

161,MAC,"With the smartphone market maturing, Apple (AAPL) is preparing for the next era of personal computing: ambient computing, UBS analyst Steven Milunovich said Wednesday.It's a market where Apple could be a winner, Milunovich said in a research report.Ambient computing is computing that is around you and always on. The Apple Watch, AirPods and voice-activated Siri personal assistant technology are early steps toward the ambient paradigm, Milunovich said. Ambient computing will be unobtrusive and ubiquitous. Apple CEO Tim Cook has referred to it as ""iOS everywhere.""""Forecasting the company's future based on today's products is difficult. Mac sales in 2001 or iPod units in 2007 didn't have much to say about where the puck was going,"" Milunovich said. ""We think of Apple's evolution in paradigms.

162,MAC,"The overwhelming media consensus regarding the first presidential debate -- Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton and Lester Holt -- is that Clinton won.If she did win it was because Trump, after a strong opening 30 minutes, allowed himself to get baited into emotional and tendentious self-defense.And because the media have decided to focus on the tendentious, such as the utterly moronic issue of whether, in 1996, Trump called then-Miss Universe Alicia Machado ""Miss Piggy,"" almost all the debate analyses ignored many of the most important things each candidate said.On those grounds, Clinton did not win. On many truly significant subjects, she said things that were actually frightening, and he said things that were actually important.Here are some examples.Clinton explained how she would expand government control over American life: ""We also have to make the economy fairer. That starts with raising the national minimum wage and also (guaranteeing), finally, equal pay for women's work. I also want to see more companies do profit-sharing. If you help create the profits, you should be able to share in them, not just the executives at the top.""It's astonishing how little attention this proposal of forcing companies to give a specified share of their earnings to employees received in the post-debate coverage. It's socialism, bordering on communism.What she will have the government provide for free is ""affordable child care and debt-free college.""She will have it paid for ""by raising taxes on the wealthy. ""I think,"" she said, ""it's time that the wealthy and corporations paid their fair share to support this country.""According to Clinton, a ""fair share"" is not constituted by a 50 percent-plus individual income tax rate (including state income taxes and property taxes) and the top 1 percent of wage earners paying nearly half of all individual income taxes, while earning 20 percent of total income. Nor is it constituted by the 35 percent corporate tax rate, the highest among major Western countries.Trump described his tax proposal: ""Under my plan, I'll be reducing taxes tremendously from 35 percent to 15 percent for companies (and) small and big businesses. That's going to be a job creator like we haven't seen since Ronald Reagan. ... Companies will come. They will build. They will expand. New companies will start.""Is that not important and substantive?Clinton believes that reducing taxes ""is not how we grow the economy."" Isn't her economy-crushing view worthy of more attention than ""Miss Piggy?""Trump, on the other hand, knows what virtually every economist knows: Tax cuts and regulatory reductions produce jobs. He said to Clinton: ""You are going to approve one of the biggest tax increases in history. You are going to drive business out. ... You are going to regulate these businesses out of existence. ... New companies cannot form, and old companies are going out of business. And you want to increase the regulation and make them even worse. I'm going to cut regulations. I'm going to cut taxes big league, and you're going to raise taxes big league. End of story.""End of story is correct. Could Trump have been clearer on how to revive the American economy? Could Clinton have been clearer on how she would suppress growth and vastly expand the size and power of the government?On the 2008 recession, Clinton was mendacious and demagogic, saying that it ""was in large part because of tax policies that slashed taxes on the wealthy, failed to invest in the middle class, took their eyes off of Wall Street and created a perfect storm.""There is no truth to what she said. The bursting of the real estate bubble that caused the 2008 recession had nothing to do with ""slashed taxes."" It was overwhelmingly caused by her husband, President Bill Clinton, and the Democrats' attempt at social engineering, by forcing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and even private banks to provide billions of dollars in home loans to people -- many of whom were minorities -- who could not sustain their mortgage payments as soon as interest rates on their adjustable-rate mortgages were raised. (Had Trump made this point, it would have been a highlight of the evening.)Clinton described her gigantic-government -- and preposterous -- solution to the sluggish economy: ""We can deploy a half a billion more solar panels. We can have enough clean energy to power every home. We can build a new modern electric grid. That's a lot of jobs; that's a lot of new economic activity.""Trump's correct rejoinder was: ""She talks about solar panels. We invested in a solar company ... that was a disaster.""Yet there was another Clinton expansion of federal power that went unnoted. She said: ""I'm going to have a special prosecutor. We're going to enforce the trade deals we have, and we're going to hold people accountable.""Clinton and Trump discussed her emails.Clinton said: ""I made my mistake using a private email. ... And if I had to do it over again, I would obviously do it differently. But I'm not going to make any excuses. It was a mistake, and I take responsibility for that.""Trump said: ""That was more than a mistake. That was done purposely. When you have your staff taking the Fifth Amendment ... so they're not prosecuted, when you have the man that set up the illegal server taking the Fifth, I think it's disgraceful. And believe me, this country thinks it ... is disgraceful also.""Who won that exchange, American media?Clinton on race: ""Race remains a significant challenge in our country. Unfortunately, race still determines too much ... it determines how they are treated in the criminal justice system. We've just seen those two tragic examples in both Tulsa and Charlotte.""In Charlotte, a black officer killed a black man who wielded a gun after officers -- whose police department is headed by a black man -- repeatedly yelled, ""Drop the gun."" And yet, Clinton charged the police and America with racism.If you want more race baiting, America, vote for Clinton.Why is there so much black-on-black murder?""We've got to get guns out of the hands of people who should not have them,"" Clinton insightfully observed, as if there were one American who doesn't want to do so.Clinton added, ""The gun epidemic is a leading cause of death of young African-American men, more than the next nine causes put together."" A question for her is, which is more responsible for black males committing murder at a higher rate than any other Americans: too many guns, or too few fathers?But it was not her gun-based and racism-based explanations of black crime that troubled the American media. It was Trump's responses.First, Trump said: ""Secretary Clinton doesn't want to use a couple of words, and that's law and order. ... If we don't have it, we're not going to have a country.""Second, he correctly noted: ""We have a situation where we have our inner cities, African-Americans (and) Hispanics are living in hell because it's so dangerous. You walk down the street, you get shot. In Chicago, they've had thousands of shootings ... Is this a war-torn country? ... We have to stop the violence. We have to bring back law and order. In a place like Chicago ... in fact, almost 4,000 have been killed since Barack Obama became president.""And third, he said: ""Right now, our police, in many cases, are afraid to do anything. We have to protect our inner cities because African-American communities are being decimated by crime.""To all of these powerful truths, Clinton could only respond with demagoguery. She said, ""Well, I've heard Donald say this at his rallies, and it's really unfortunate that he paints such a dire, negative picture of black communities in our country."" She added later, ""When it comes to policing ... I have said, in my first budget, we would put money into that budget to help us deal with implicit bias by retraining a lot of our police officers.""That's what America needs -- more federal governance of Americans' lives and more re-education programs. (And what is ""implicit bias""?)Meanwhile, Trump, in his simple way, uttered a truth that I can't recall any Republican has uttered: ""Look, the African-American community has been let down by our politicians. They talk good around election time, like right now, and after the election they said, 'See you later. I'll see you in four years.'""On ISIS and Iraq, Trump correctly said: ""President Obama and Secretary Clinton created a vacuum the way they got out of Iraq ... They shouldn't have been in, but once they got in, the way they got out was a disaster.""This was another major truth ignored in all the commentary on Miss Piggy and ""birtherism."" Iraq was finally rendered relatively peaceful, and then Obama announced that America was leaving.On the Iran deal, Trump was also dead-on: ""You started the Iran deal, that's another beauty, where you have a country that was ready to fall ... They were choking on the sanctions. And now they're going to be actually probably a major power at some point pretty soon, the way they're going.""Perhaps my favorite moment of the evening -- also completely ignored -- was Trump's quick reaction to Clinton saying that nuclear weapons ""is the No. 1 threat we face in the world."" He said: ""I agree with her on one thing: The single greatest problem the world has is nuclear armament. ... Not global warming, like you think and your president thinks.""She never responded to this devastating point about left-wing hysteria over global warming. But she did have a lot to say about Miss Piggy, birtherism and Trump's tax returns. And so do her allies: the American media.

166,MAC,"Election 2016: During Monday's presidential debate, Hillary Clinton weighed in on the 2008 financial crisis, blaming ""tax cuts"" during the Bush years and implying that deregulation was also to blame. It's another example of the whoppers Hillary Clinton and other Democrats tell about the recession they caused.If a gold medal were awarded for chutzpah, Hillary Clinton would surely be a multiple winner by now.""Well, let's stop for a second and remember where we were eight years ago,"" Clinton said. ""We had the worst financial crisis, the Great Recession, the worst since the 1930s. That was in large part because of tax policies that slashed taxes on the wealthy, failed to invest in the middle class, took their eyes off Wall Street, and created a perfect storm.""To be as kind as possible, the idea that ""tax policies"" -- including the 2003 tax cuts — were the root cause of the financial panic is an idea espoused by no one we're aware of in the economics profession. It was those tax cuts that in fact revived the economy, which had begun failing in the waning months of the Clinton administration.From 2003 to 2007, the tax cuts helped push real GDP up 15.2%, or more than 3% a year. And, as Avik Roy notes in a recent Forbes piece, ""the wealthy actually contributed more in taxes after the 'cuts' went into effect."" In 2003, the top 1% in incomes paid $256 billion in taxes. In 2007, they paid $471 billion.The ""failed to invest in the middle class"" line is even better, since it is entirely devoid of meaning. Seems we had nearly $8 trillion in added government ""investment,"" as our soaring national debt now shows, thanks to President Obama, Hillary and the rest of the profligate party she now leads.Did that go to the middle class? Sure doesn't look like it.But what's most interesting about Hillary's remark is it ignores the actual responsibility that she and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, bear for creating the financial crisis. It's hypocrisy that the Clinton Democrats, who created the housing bubble in the 1990s and 2000s with their policies, now have spun a false tale of Wall Street greed, crazy deregulation, and tax cuts as the causes of the crisis.Here's the real story, in brief: In 1995, using the powers of the presidency, Bill Clinton turned the 1977 Community Reinvestment Act into an aggressive program that basically forced banks to lend money to ""underserved"" communities. That meant those with low incomes who couldn't necessarily repay a loan.Meanwhile, his Department of Housing and Urban Development got involved in a big way.Jack Cashill, writing for the American Thinker, notes: ""HUD, which Congress had made the regulator of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 1992, began to pressure these agencies to set numerical goals for affordable housing, even if that meant buying subprime mortgages. The media cheered the agencies on.""Under HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo, the agency became particularly aggressive, in 2000 making a goal of over $1 trillion in new loans to low-income minority households. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were told to make at least half of their loans to low- and moderate-income borrowers, mainly minorities.Banks suddenly found that regulators had the power to refuse their branch expansions or reject a merger if they weren't making enough loans to otherwise unqualified minority borrowers. So they played along. They made the loans, and Freddie and Fannie bought the loans right back. It was like a game of musical chairs, and the Fed kept the game going in the early 2000s by cutting interest rates.Every time Republicans in Congress or President Bush talked about reforming housing programs, Democrats like Rep. Barney Frank of Massachusetts and Sen. Chris Dodd of Connecticut threw fits, threatening to gum up Congress and implying that GOP lawmakers were racists. The Republicans backed off.From 1997 to 2007, with the Fed slashing interest rates and flooding the banking system with liquidity, home lending soared. Banks abandoned long-standing lending standards to avoid being punished by regulators or singled out by newly empowered ""community groups"" such as ACORN as anti-minority.""As a result of these policies,"" wrote Peter J. Wallison, a member of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, in a scathing dissent from the group's official findings, ""by the middle of 2007, there were approximately 27 million subprime and Alt-A mortgages in the U.S. financial system — half of all mortgages outstanding — with an aggregate value of over $4.5 trillion."" And by 2008, Fannie and Freddie had on their books more than three-quarters of all U.S. subprime and Alt-A loans made.When the Fed began raising interest rates to slow inflation, and put a brake on soaring housing prices, many of the loans made to low-income black and Hispanic borrowers predictably fell into delinquency or default — leaving mortgage lenders, Fannie and Freddie, and Wall Street with enormous losses.The ensuing Great Recession, as Hillary helpfully pointed out Monday night, did indeed cost 9 million people their jobs and wiped out $13 trillion in household wealth — an unparalleled financial disaster.But let's be very clear here: Tax cuts had nothing to do with this whatsoever. Nor did the minor tinkering to the 1930s-era Glass-Steagall law in 1999, which was implicated in none of the major Wall Street insolvencies or subsequent bailouts during the crisis. It's another die-hard Democratic myth, intended to absolve themselves of blame for the crisis. And the economy-killing Dodd-Frank financial regulations passed in 2010 were based on these Democratic myths — which is why we're now having the worst economic expansion in modern history.The truth is this: Bill Clinton, working with congressional Democrats in the 1990s, empowered a massive, well-funded bureaucracy to regulate and punish those in the private sector that didn't go along with Clinton's plans to lend vast sums of money to people who could never pay the money back.And when it all went sideways in 2007, they pointed fingers at everyone but themselves. They're still doing it.Hillary Clinton knows well what happened in the 1990s while she was First Lady. She was a major supporter of these programs and, as touted at the time, a virtual ""co-president."" To now suggest others and ""tax cuts"" are to blame is just another intentional lie. Maybe the media can fact-check that.Related:Financial Crisis Caused By Bad Policies, Not Tax Cuts'The Big Short' Shorts The Truth Of The Financial CrisisThe Government, Not The Market, Created Our Financial Crisis

167,MAC,"Apple (AAPL) on Monday showed off updates to its major software platforms, unveiled a revamped Apple Music service and introduced a wider range of expressions in its iMessage app, including bigger emojis.Investors weren't impressed, and Apple stock fell 1.5%, to 97.34, on the stock market today.Apple pitched its software news in the opening keynote presentation at the company's annual Worldwide Developers Conference in San Francisco, which runs through Friday.Apple outlined changes to its four key software platforms: macOS (previously Mac OS X), iOS, watchOS and tvOS.""At Apple, we believe that technology should lift humanity and should enrich people's lives in all the ways they want to experience it, whether it's on their wrist, in their living room, on their desk, in the palm of their hand, in the car or even automating their home,"" Apple CEO Tim Cook told developers at the show. ""This is a huge moment for us -- four great platforms that become even more capable with working with all of you.""With watchOS 3, due out this fall, Apple Watch applications launch much faster -- instantly instead of seconds -- and are easier to switch between. Apple also added new watch faces, a control center for watch apps, and social features for fitness apps.Plus, Apple has added an SOS feature so you can call 911 emergency services by holding down a side button on the Apple Watch.For Apple TV, Apple is bringing the functionality of the Siri remote control to an iPhone app. With Siri voice controls, Apple TV users will be able to search YouTube videos as well as videos across streaming services. Plus, you can jump to specific channels using voice commands. The latest version of tvOS will come out this fall.The next version of the Mac computer operating system is macOS Sierra, scheduled for release in the fall. It features improvements in continuity and cloud services. It does a better job of sharing preferences and work-in-progress between Apple computers and mobile devices. Apple also has optimized storage by compressing photos, documents and other files on Macs.Apple is also bringing its Siri personal assistant app to the Mac from mobile devices. Microsoft (MSFT) has already done the same with its Cortana application on Windows PCs.Apple announced that it is opening up Siri to third-party developers. Siri will work with other companies' apps for messaging, e-commerce, social networking and other applications.Siri today responds to over 2 billion requests each week from customers.The next iteration of Apple's mobile device software is iOS 10. It is expected to launch in September with the release of the iPhone 7.Apple's iOS 10 has a ""raise-to-wake"" feature, like the Apple Watch, so you can see notifications such as text messages without having to manually turn on your iPhone. Apple has also improved the iOS control screen, photo organization, maps and news.Apple announced that it has redesigned its Apple Music service from the ground up. The interface has been simplified and personalized, and the app also now includes song lyrics. Apple Music has over 15 million paid subscribers.Likewise, Apple unveiled a new app called Home that builds on its smart home application, known as HomeKit. With Home, iPhone and Apple Watch users can control lighting, thermostat, door locks and various appliances from their mobile devices.Apple bolstered its text messaging app by making emojis bigger and allowing people to ""emojify"" their texts by changing words into emoji images. It also supports videos, animation, music, handwritten notes and more customizations.Apple opened up its iMessage app to third-party developers, which was a key theme at this year's WWDC. It also opened up Siri and Maps to outside developers.Apple touted its embrace of end-to-end encryption by default for all its applications to enhance security and privacy. The company added ""differential privacy"" to track online trends using anonymized information gathered from millions of users.""We believe you should have great features and great privacy,"" said Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of software engineering.CEO Cook summed up the announcements as ""great updates"" to all of its platforms:""Starting with watchOS -- faster performance, better navigation, all new fitness and health features to help you live a better life; tvOS -- the future of TV is apps, and it now just got a whole lot better with expanded Siri search and single sign-on; macOS Sierra -- bringing Siri and Apple Pay to the Mac, along with some other incredibly powerful features; and a gigantic release of iOS, the mother of all releases -- incredible new features for Messages, all new designs for photos, Apple News and Apple Music, and incredible new opportunities for developers to integrate their apps with Siri, Maps and Messages.""

170,MAC,"War On Cops: The number of violent crimes jumped last year by 4%, a sad indictment of eight years of President Obama's policing and prison-sentencing ""reforms"" and further bolstering the argument that the so-called ""Ferguson Effect"" is largely to blame for the upsurge in criminal violence.If you don't think this rise in violent crime, especially murder, is strange, consider this: While violent crime is soaring — murder and manslaughter in 2015 rose almost 11% from a year earlier — property crimes fell 2.6%, marking the 13th-straight year of decline, according to the latest crime report by the FBI.That divergence between violent crimes and property crimes comes after eight years of President Obama suggesting that our criminal justice system — from street-level police to our courts to our jails and prisons — are just too hard on criminals.Worse, over his two terms, Obama has joined with the left-leaning media and progressive intelligentsia to poo-pooh the notion that letting violent criminals out of prison, pulling back from aggressive, ""broken-window"" policing, and pushing a false narrative that police are engaged in a ""war"" on young black men have any impact on crime.The result of this denial, sadly and predictably, has been more crime.As the data show, the long, steady decline in violent crime rates that took place in the 1990s and into the 2000s has ended. The nation today is increasingly violent and racially divided, in large part thanks to Obama's refusal to rebuke rioters in Ferguson, Mo., Baltimore or, most recently, Charlotte, N.C.This refusal has made it much harder for police to do their jobs, turning what once were routine police contacts in minority neighborhoods into highly fraught confrontations that can turn violent in an instant — and often do. Police are pulling back from aggressive crime control in troubled areas, letting criminals, many freshly out of prison, take advantage of the lack of police presence to commit crimes — most often, with minority citizens as their victims.Meanwhile, Obama, along with liberal officials at the state level, has promulgated sentencing reforms that led to 400,000 felons being released from state and federal prisons from 2009 to 2014. This has only added fuel to the fire.Of course, these data bolster a case that has been made increasingly by criminologists and others that the soaring crime rate is a direct result of the ""Ferguson Effect,"" a phrase coined by Manhattan Institute Fellow Heather Mac Donald, ""wherein officers desist from discretionary policing and criminals thus become emboldened.""The ""Ferguson Effect"" followed the outbreak of violence and rioting that erupted in Ferguson, Mo., in August 2014 after a local man, Michael Brown, was killed by a police officer. Early reports that Brown's hands were up in the air, that he said ""don't shoot"" and was killed in cold blood proved to be entirely false. As video showed, the 300-pound man fought with police and tried to grab a weapon.Nonetheless, the lie had legs, and ""Hands Up, Don't Shoot!"" T-shirts repeating the myth became de rigueur at violent demonstrations around the country. The subsequent withdrawal of police from troubled urban areas has been accompanied by a sharp rise in murders and assaults.Tragically, the Obama administration largely supported the myth, suggesting the ""Ferguson Effect"" is baseless: ""While certainly there might be anecdotal evidence there, as all have noted, there's no data to support it,"" Attorney General Loretta Lynch said in November 2015.Lynch was followed by White House Spokesman Josh Earnest, who said last May, ""There's just no evidence to substantiate that (Ferguson Effect).""Now, despite the vitriol and accusations of racism hurled at Mac Donald and others who have pointed out that Ferguson seemed to have a negative impact on policing and crime, the FBI data concretely back Mac Donald's thesis.And it's not the only recent study to do so. A study funded by the Justice Department, released in June, sought to explain the disturbing 16% surge in murders in 56 of the largest U.S. cities in 2015. In the study, University of St. Louis criminologist Richard Rosenfeld found ""stronger support"" for the Ferguson Effect, as the prime cause of the upsurge in murders, than other explanations.""The other explanations have a difficult time ... explaining the timing and magnitude of the increase we saw in 2015 and continue to see in some cities in the current year,"" said Rosenfeld, once himself a skeptic of the Ferguson Effect.We didn't think it was possible, but in addition to trashing the economy and wrecking America's relations with its closest allies, President Obama can now take credit for one more dubious accomplishment — ending a decades-long decline in violent crime in America. Add this to the long list of things the next president will have to fix.RELATED:DEA Joins FBI In Confirming 'Ferguson Effect' Their Boss DeniesObama Defends Black Lives Matter, Calls Violent Crime Spike 'Hype'

171,MAC,"Chipmaker Intel (INTC) earned at least eight price-target increases for its stock after raising its current-quarter revenue guidance on improving PC sales on Friday.Also Friday, teardowns of Apple's (AAPL) new iPhone 7 handset revealed that Intel has scored the communications chip set in some models, replacing Qualcomm (QCOM).Intel stock, however, fell 1.4% to 37.16 at the close on the stock market today. Intel stock rose 3% and reached a more than 15-year high of 38.05 on Friday.IBD'S TAKE: Intel stock is at longtime highs but ranks just No. 7 on IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Manufacturing industry group (which doesn't include fabless chipmakers). See which are the top-rated chip stocks, and why, at IBD Stock Checkup.Investment bank Jefferies raised its price target on Intel stock to 49 from 44 and kept its buy rating.Mizuho raised its price target on Intel to 42 from 38 and reiterated its buy rating.Needham upped its price target on Intel to 43 from 38 and kept its buy rating.Nomura raised its PT on Intel to 42 from 38 and maintained its buy rating.Pacific Crest Securities increased its PT on Intel to 42 from 38 and reiterated its overweight rating.Cowen maintained its market perform rating on Intel, but upped its price target to 38 from 36.UBS upped its price target on Intel to 43 from 40 and reiterated its buy rating.Baird raised its PT on Intel to 42 from 40 and kept its outperform rating.Early Friday, Intel said it expects third-quarter revenue of $15.3 billion to $15.9 billion vs. its prior range of $14.4 billion to $15.4 billion. The chip giant largely credited ""replenishment of PC supply chain inventory"" but also is ""seeing some signs of improving PC demand.""The midpoint of its Q3 sales guidance would be a 7.8% yearly gain, its best since Q3 2014.Intel's commentary on an improving PC business bodes well for PC makers HP Inc. (HPQ) and Apple, RBC Capital Markets said in a report Friday. Apple is expected to update its Mac computer lineup in October.UBS analyst Stephen Chin said PCs remain a driver for Intel's stock since the segment accounts for 53% of sales.""One outstanding question is whether this was a one-time benefit (for Intel's Q3) or the result of better consumer interest in new products and replacement of older PCs,"" Chin said in a report.In addition to improving PC sales, Intel is likely to benefit from better performance in its data center chip business, Nomura analyst Romit Shah said in a report Friday.""The Broadwell-E server refresh should drive stronger results in the second half of the year,"" Shah said.

172,MAC," The thought came to me as I watched the Cleveland police clear away protesters from the city's Public Square. Half a dozen on horseback, nearly a dozen or so on heavy-duty bikes, the cops deftly corralled the protesters without so much as touching anyone, much as a border collie channels a flock of uncomprehending sheep.Then it struck me: What I was seeing was not the real thing, not a genuine spontaneous protest, stoked by anger and with the constant potential of breaking into unstoppable violence. Instead, I was watching a group of re-enactors, wearing costumes copied from the past and carrying signs minimally updated.And what can be more American and 21st century? Every month, thousands of people re-enact, in authentically scratchy uniforms and on the same killing grounds, the great battles of the Civil War or American Revolution.So it's not so odd to see national convention re-enactors reprising the protests of 1968 or 1972.Re-enactors are admirable for their determination to get in close touch with our history, its triumphs and tragedies. And of course it's heartening that re-enactments, unlike the actual events, are almost entirely harmless to participants and spectators.I remember the smell of tear-gas-induced vomit and the sight of bloodstains on sidewalks in Chicago in 1968. I witnessed nothing like that in Cleveland's Public Square (itself a monument to the Union's Civil War victory) or in the streets of Philadelphia where the more numerous Bernie Sanders protestors were re-enacting the antiwar, anti-corporate protests of half a century before.The protesters aren't the only re-enactors active this year. Donald Trump's rallies are larger than those any candidate has attracted in a couple of decades and more raucous and unruly and defiantly delighted when the candidate transgresses the unwritten but fiercely media-enforced rules of political correctness.Trump rallies can be seen as re-enactments of the rallies for George Wallace in his three campaigns for the Democratic nomination and his third-party race in 1968. But like the riot re-enactors in the Public Square, the air of menace is almost totally absent. Wallace was an outright segregationist, willing to condone violence against peaceful protestors. Trump wants different trade agreements and enforcement of current immigration laws -- mistaken policies, you may believe, but not denials of basic rights.There is an element of re-enactment, too, in the Black Lives Matter movement. But the property damage in Ferguson, Missouri, and other recent riot sites was microscopic next to the destruction of much of Newark and Detroit in 1967. The police tactics that have raised complaints also pale in magnitude next to what was standard operating procedure in the 1960s.The #BLM re-enactors are doing some actual harm, unfortunately. As the Manhattan Institute's Heather Mac Donald has documented, their protests have led police in cities such as St. Louis and Baltimore and Chicago to draw back from proactive enforcement in high-crime neighborhoods, resulting in sharp increases in African-American deaths. Not as bad as the '60s, but bad enough.The surprise re-enactor of 2016 turns out, given the events of last weekend, to be Hillary Clinton. Like another past Democratic nominee, she decided to ""power past"" (the verb form uttered in stentorian unison by her admirers) warnings of illness to risk the consequences of outdoor campaigning in New York City.The analogous previous nominee was Franklin Roosevelt, seriously ill as he ran for a fourth term as president at age 62 in 1944. Roosevelt decided to campaign through the four large boroughs of New York City in an open car on Oct. 23, a cold, rainy day. The photos show a wet but smiling candidate, waving a soggy hat as crowds of 1 million people cheered him.That was four months after D-Day, three days after Gen. MacArthur returned to the Philippines: Victory was in sight. New York City cast 7% of the nation's votes that fall, 61% for Roosevelt. The president died six months later.Hillary Clinton's version took the much milder form of appearing at a 9/11 commemoration on a breezy, sunny, 79-degree morning, two days after being diagnosed with pneumonia. Reportedly dehydrated, she collapsed and had to be lifted into a car, losing a shoe in the process.Clinton seems less unhealthy and less lucky than Roosevelt, whose trip around New York was a success. But Clinton is also less accomplished: Supervising the reset with Russia and the pivot to Asia doesn't compare with promising and achieving absolute victory in World War II. Re-enactments, however earnest, are not the real thing.

Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) unveiled software and services updates at its developers conference, while hardware dominated the E3 video game expo.For the week, the Nasdaq fell 1.9%, hurt by big techs such as Apple, Alphabet and Microsoft. The S&P 500 lost 1.2% and the Dow 1.1%. The Federal Reserve took a more dovish stance on rate hikes, but was still more hawkish than markets. Meanwhile, Brexit fears sent bond yields tumbling worldwide. The German 10-year bund went negative for the first time and the 10-year Treasury yield hit 2012 levels, though both closed well off those lows. The S&P 500 joined the Nasdaq and Dow in undercutting its 50-day line. The Nasdaq fell below its 200-day average.  Energy stocks fell with oil prices, while American Air and global peers tumbled on Brexit and terror fears.The Federal Reserve left interest rates alone, as expected, in the wake of the weak May jobs report and concerns over the looming Brexit vote. Policymakers turned more dovish. Six officials now see just one rate hike this year vs. just one official previous. Still, 11 are betting on two hikes. Yet markets, which have priced out expectations for a hike until next year, sold off following the Fed meeting. The Bank of Japan's decision to stand pat also hit markets, even though no BoJ action was expected.Meanwhile, industrial output fell 0.4% in May, but two regional manufacturing reports were positive in June. Retail sales were stronger than expected in May, while housing starts were in line. Consumer inflation remained tame.Microsoft said Monday that it will acquire LinkedIn for $26.2 billion cash, or $196-per-share, surprising many investors and analysts. The transaction is seen closing this year. The buy brings LinkedIn's user data and sales tools to the tech giant. Canaccord Genuity said the move might prompt more cloud-computing M&A. Microsoft stock fell 2.6% for the week. LinkedIn shot up 45.6% to 190.80.Net neutrality rules were upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals, D.C. Circuit, delivering a big win to the Federal Communications Commission, as well as Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and Netflix. AT&T (T), Verizon Communications (VZ) and Comcast (CMCSA) had hoped the three-judge panel would at least strike down net neutrality rules applied to wireless networks. AT&T and others plan an appeal to the Supreme Court. But the one judge who dissented did agree in part that the agency had the authority to reclassify broadband internet as a telecom service under Title II of the 1934 Communications Act.Apple unveiled software improvements for the iPhone, Apple Watch, Apple TV and Mac computers during a keynote event at its Worldwide Developers Conference. The company also revamped its Apple Music service, introduced a wider range of expressions in its Messages app, and brought Siri and Apple Pay to the Mac. Apple Watch software enhancements included new health and fitness functions and an SOS feature for calling 911 by holding down a button.Some analysts cut price targets following WWDC. Meanwhile, a Beijing intellectual property rights regulator said the Apple iPhone 6 violates patents of a local rival. But Apple smartphone sales will continue pending an appeal.Apple shares fell 3.5% so far this week.Hardware news stole the show at E3, with Microsoft announcing it's launching the Xbox One S later this year and confirming it's also working on a high-end console dubbed ""Scorpio"" for the 2017 holiday season. Meanwhile, Sony (SNE) set an Oct. 13 release date for PlayStation VR.Analysts say Electronic Arts (EA) games ""Battlefield 1"" and ""Titanfall 2"" captured the most positive buzz, though EA was not on E3's show floor but at its own event across the street. Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) shares fell amid the absence of new game title announcements. Analysts said the lack of major game titles for new virtual-reality headsets was a letdown, but publishers don't want to devote their resources until the VR market becomes more established.Meanwhile, Chinese messaging giant Tencent Holdings (TCEHY) reportedly is close to a $9 billion takeover deal for ""Clash of Clans"" creator Supercell. Tencent owns Riot Games, which runs the popular ""League of Legends"" game.Oracle (ORCL) reported fourth-quarter earnings per share minus items of 81 cents, up 4% from a year earlier, meeting views and ending a four-quarter string of year-over-year EPS declines.Revenue fell 1% to $10.6 billion, the fifth straight quarterly decline but slightly above the consensus of $10.47 billion.  The business software powerhouse is shifting from on-premise software licensed for the long term to software-as-a-service delivered via the cloud. Oracle cloud revenue in Q4 reached $859 million, up 49%.Oracle stock rose 2.4% for the week, with all of the gains coming Friday after its late Thursday earnings report.China e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA)  sees revenue rising 48% in the year ending in March 2017, well above the consensus estimate of 38.6%. It was Alibaba's first financial preview since coming public in 2014, and comes as the company faces an investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission into accounting practices.Meanwhile, China search engine leader Baidu (BIDU) late Monday cut its Q2 revenue forecast about 10%, citing advertising cuts and delays by health care firms. Baidu faced public outrage and regulatory probes after the death of a college student who accused Baidu of leading him to a false cancer treatment.

Alibaba rallied 1.4%.Kroger (KR) first-quarter sales rose 4.7% to $3.46 billion, a bit lighter than analysts' consensus, hurt by low fuel prices at its gas stations. Same-store sales minus fuel rose 2.4%. Earnings per share climbed 13% to 70 cents, beating estimates by a penny, as cost curbs lifted operating margins. But the grocery giant sees full-year  EPS at the low end of its guidance due to gas margins.Kroger shares fell 4.4% this week.Meanwhile, the FDA accused Whole Foods Market (WFM) of ""filth"" and other unsanitary conditions at an Everett, Mass., facility. Shares of the organic and natural foods grocer have tumbled nearly 10.9% so far this week.Symantec (SYMC) stock rocketed 15.5% this week to a 52-week high after the No. 2 cybersecurity firm said it would buy Blue Coat Systems for $4.65 billion before the privately held cloud security firm could launch an initial public offering. Blue Coat is a market leader in secure web gateway products and other segments. Blue Coat CEO Greg Clark will head up Symantec. Symantec CEO Mike Brown announced last month he would step down, as the company reported fiscal Q4 sales that missed expectations and said it would cut 1,200 jobs and close a quarter of its offices.The Energy Information Administration said U.S. crude production fell 0.3% to 8.716 million barrels of oil per day after rising the week before. Stockpiles fell by 993,000, less than expectations for a decline of 1.4 million barrels, but below the American Petroleum Institute's estimate that U.S. stockpiles rose by 1.2 million barrels. The International Energy Agency said it saw its first ""significant drop"" in supply since 2013 in May and that oil markets will likely balance in the second half of the year. OPEC also sees oil markets in balance by year-end. Meanwhile, U.S. rigs in operation rose for a third straight week to an eight-week high, a sign of stabilization after oil prices rebounded strongly from January lows.But prices fell sharply as Brexit fears raised growth worries and propped up the dollar. Oil prices fell 2.2% to $47.98 a barrel, but closed well off weekly lows.The ISIS-inspired mass shooting of a gay nightclub in Orlando, Fla., that killed 49 plus the shooter sent shares of gunmakers Smith & Wesson (SWHC) and Sturm Ruger (RGR) sharply higher Monday as Wall Street anticipated higher gun sales spurred by regulatory concerns. Smith & Wesson reported strong earnings and guidance late Thursday. Smith & Wesson stock rose 10.5% this week. Sturm Ruger climbed 5.6%.Meanwhile, airline stocks tumbled, partly on fears that the Orlando attack could deter travel as well as concerns that the U.K. could vote June 23 to exit the European Union. American Airlines (AAL), Delta Air Lines (DAL) and United Airlines (UAL) fell to their lowest levels since late 2014 during the week.Card issuers Capital One (COF) (IBD) and Synchrony Financial (SYF) downplayed any potential concerns related to rising consumer debt. But Synchrony said Tuesday that it expected to write off slightly more consumer debt as a loss over the next year. A day later, Capital One said it would not change its loss forecast even as its net charge-off rate and delinquencies rose in May. Warnings have increased about rising credit-card and auto-loan debt. Synchrony crashed 16.3% this week, and Capital One 8.35%. American Express (AXP) lost 4.8% and Discover Financial Services (DFS) fell 6.2%.

175,MAC,"Square (SQ) stock dipped Tuesday while PayPal (PYPL) rose as investors digested upgrades to Apple Pay announced at the start of Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference in San Francisco.Apple (AAPL), as expected, said Monday that Apple Pay would be extended to its Safari mobile browser, making it easier for consumers to shop online via iPads and iPhones. In a surprise move, though, Apple also introduced a “Pay with Apple Pay” option for its Mac computer users, in direct competition with payments leader PayPal.Apple also announced peer-to-peer payments would be available though third-party apps on its iMessage platform. At WWDC, Apple showcased a feature that lets Square Cash users send money via the Apple iMessage messaging app.“Square Cash was featured in the iMessage App Store, and a demonstration was provided that involved exchanging $200 via iMessage, Apple's most highly engaged application,” Josh Beck, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities, said in a research report late Monday. “We view this as a positive for Square, which could substantially increase the number of Square Cash users and potentially brand awareness.""For (PayPal’s similar peer-to-peer payments service) Venmo, we believe increased competition could create a headwind to monetization, though it could also create opportunity if Venmo were to partner with Apple.”Square closed down 0.3% to 8.89 in the stock market today, four-month closing low. PayPal rose 1.7%, rebounding off its 200-day line and snapping a seven-day losing streak. Apple stock rose 0.1% to 97.46 after falling 1.5% on Monday.Rolled out in 2014, Apple Pay has supported in-store shopping at retail checkouts, as well as in-app purchases for Uber, Disney (DIS) stores and others.

176,MAC,"Looking at minute-by-minute trading activity in Apple (AAPL) stock during the company's Worldwide Developers Conference keynote on Monday, it's clear  investors like emojis as well as Apple Music -- or at least its dynamic head of consumer marketing, Bozoma Saint John.Apple stock hit its high of the day of 99.12 at the market open on Monday. It reached its session low of 97.10, after the keynote concluded without any big surprises. When the keynote began, Apple stock was at 97.58.At several points during the two-hour presentation, Apple stock rallied, likely indicating investor enthusiasm for the news being webcast worldwide.Apple stock hit its highest point during the keynote of 98.05 when executives were discussing improvements to Apple's iMessage app, including the use of larger picture characters called emojis. With its iOS 10 release this fall, Apple will liven up iMessage with animation, snazzier graphics and the ability to incorporate music and videos, as well as a feature that turns words into emojis.Critics say Apple is just copying Facebook (FB) and Snapchat.“In trying to make its native messaging client more appealing, especially to younger users, Apple is borrowing all the hallmarks of its competitors,” wrote The Verge reporter Nick Statt. “Gone is the simple blue bubble to denote a fellow iPhone owner. In its place is a dizzying number of ways to interact that go well beyond the written word.”Apple stock stayed near that WWDC high as Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of software engineering, discussed Apple’s commitment to smartphone user security and privacy.Earlier in the program, Apple shares spiked when Bozoma Saint John took the stage to discuss improvements to the company's year-old Apple Music service. The changes will make the Apple Music interface simpler, cleaner and easier to navigate. Also coming are song lyrics and personalized music options.Many tech writers and Apple fans fell in love with Saint John, whose charming and funny performance made her a standout. Business Insider said Saint John ""stole the show."" BuzzFeed crowned her “the coolest person to ever go onstage at an Apple event.” And CNet called her the “breakout star of Apple’s WWDC” and a “breath of fresh air” at the annual event.Other things at the WWDC keynote didn't resonate with Apple stock traders.Apple stock hit its lowest level during the show, at 97.25, as executives discussed improvements to the iOS app for managing photos.Another low point, based on trading action in Apple stock, was when the company announced it's bringing Apple Pay to the Mac, allowing people to make desktop web purchases using their mobile devices.Maybe Apple should have let Saint John announce that too.Apple stock rose a small fraction, 12 cents, on Tuesday, to 97.46.

177,MAC,"Pokemon Go has racked up some amazing numbers since its July 6 launch: nearly 55 million U.S. users in its first month, including a peak of about 21 million daily active users spending more than a half-hour a day playing the game that's free to download.The most impressive number of all may be the billions of calories burned by kids out to catch the Nintendo (NTDOY) anime creatures. Yet there's one number that's bound to underwhelm: its impact on GDP. And that's nothing new when it comes to today's breakthrough technologies and products.Technological innovation is making people richer, but not necessarily in ways that pay the bills. In terms of good-paying jobs, it's had a bite-size impact since the dot-com boom.A common feature of some of today's most transformative tech innovations is that the end users often don't have to pay anything. SocialFlow, a social media management company, estimated this spring that the free publicity that Donald Trump's presidential campaign got from social networks like Facebook (FB), Twitter (TWTR) and Snapchat was equal to $380 million in paid advertising.Among the reasons that the U.S. economy has been in a prolonged growth slump is because of the way GDP is measured. GDP excludes what is known as the consumer surplus, which is how much value people derive from something in excess of how much they have to pay.IBD'S TAKE: Facebook may not be generating many jobs by historical standards of innovative companies, but it's been lucrative for investors. The social networking giant broke out of a base with a 121.18 buy point in late July. The stock moved sideways until breaking out again from a short consolidation with a 128.43 entry point. Click here for Facebook stock chart analysis.While the consumer surplus is hard to quantify, some economic analysts think it's huge.""By our usual GDP measurements WhatsApp is worth nothing ... or perhaps $100 million (if measured in terms of the income of its engineers). And yet there's some 1 billion people getting some to all of their telecoms and communications needs from this service,"" wrote Forbes columnist Tim Worstall, a fellow at the London-based Adam Smith Institute.While millions of people are playing Pokemon Go for free, many others are spending money on in-app purchases to help speed their progress in the game. The most up-to-date stats reveal that the mobile game has grossed $440 million worldwide, meaning Pokemon Go has eclipsed the earnings of some summer blockbuster movies.That sounds pretty huge, but when you consider that 500 million people have downloaded Pokemon Go, and 30 million to 40 million have played the game for about a half-hour each day, the spending comes out to something less than 50 cents for an hour of play — roughly one-tenth of the cost of an hour at the movies.Although it's unclear whether the Pokemon Go craze contributed to the summer movie slump, it is clear that people are deriving a lot more in value from the game than they are paying out of pocket. Shortly after the game's launch, researchers Michael Farren and Adam Millsap at George Mason University's Mercatus Center figured that Pokemon Go players were easily getting more than $7 in value for every $1 spent — ""even if the average consumer surplus is only a measly dollar an hour.""It's worth considering that playing Pokemon Go requires the GPS capability that comes with every smartphone and that we all now take for granted. In his 2012 book,  ""Abundance: The Future Is Better Than You Think,"" XPrize founder Peter Diamandis offered a reminder of just how much we take for granted. Taking decades-old list prices for the GPS, videoconferencing, digital voice recorder, video camera, digital camera, encyclopedia, music player, video game console and everything else that comes included, he calculated that there's more than $900,000 worth of applications in every smartphone.The implication is that traditional measurements vastly understate the impact of recent technological innovation in boosting our quality of life. Yet, when it comes to the things most people think of when they think about financial well-being — the number of good-paying jobs and the size of the economic pie as defined by GDP — the current era of technological innovation has fallen short.Technology leaders such as Apple (AAPL), Facebook, Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) have transformed how we connect — to friends, politicians, businesses and information. So you'd expect to see a dramatic impact on employment and output.Yet in those terms, the companies don't compare to some older industries.Apple, Google and Facebook, three of the largest companies by market capitalization, combined, employed only about 185,000 worldwide at the end of their 2015 fiscal years. By contrast, General Motors (GM) had 653,000 U.S. workers at its 1979 peak.Facebook's 12,691 employees generated $17.9 billion in revenue in the latest fiscal year, or $1.4 million per employee. Alphabet, despite staffing up to pursue other bets that so far amount to less than 1% of its revenue, generated $1.2 million per worker.When Alphabet releases a Google Maps update, it can go to everyone with relative ease. When General Motors introduces a new model, it has to retool factories, make each car or truck individually, then transport them to far-flung dealerships for sale. All of that takes labor, often highly paid.Apple's $2.1 million per employee doesn't really compare, given its large contract-manufacturing workforce. Meanwhile, an average Microsoft (MSFT) employee generates a more moderate $800,000 in revenue.Outside the tech sector, revenue per employee is lower still. General Electric (GE) is at $350,000 and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) at $550,000.

After adding nearly 200,000 jobs in 2015, it now employs 6.7 million people, the Computing Technology Industry Association said earlier this year.The reason it took so long was the big shift in tech manufacturing out of the U.S., as the dot-com bust and China's emergence led to a wave of outsourcing. From the end of 2000 through 2015, the U.S. tech industry shed more than 800,000 factory jobs, or 44%. More than a half million of those jobs were gone by the end of 2003.In this context of slow economic growth, weak wage gains and anger over the lost factory jobs, Donald Trump has made it a campaign speech staple to pledge that if he's elected, Apple will make its iPhones in the U.S., not in China.The logistics of shifting production from China, where some 250,000 Foxconn workers assemble the iPhone, are daunting and would entail intensive training of U.S. workers. If it were feasible, it would substantially raise the cost of an iPhone — even if the U.S. workers made little more than the minimum wage.Instead of a tech job boom, jobs in health care, social assistance, leisure, hospitality, retail and government account for 99.5% of all net employment gains dating back to the end of 2000, Labor Department data show. Since mid-2007, those sectors minus government account for about 94% of net new nonfarm jobs.That helps explain why productivity gains have been so weak since the recession, says Lakshman Achuthan of the Economic Cycle Research Institute.""Economic growth, such as it is, has been skewed toward growth in the number of hours worked, largely in lower-wage service sector jobs, while capital investment has taken a huge hit"" in the aftermath of the Great Recession, Achuthan wrote.While companies outside the tech sector have bolstered tech employment internally, the surprising truth is that the latest wave of innovation has benefited relatively few workers directly, and the economywide impact also has been limited. Those facts help explain weak economic growth, weak wage growth and the rise of political populism.If productivity, a measure of output per worker hour, had continued to grow at its pre-2004 rate, the economy would be about 15% bigger, calculates University of Chicago economics professor Chad Syverson. That's another $2.7 trillion, or $21,900 per household. If that had been the case, one can imagine that the 2016 election cycle would sound a whole lot less angry.Instead, productivity growth has crawled at an average 0.5% a year over the past half-decade, Labor Department data show. That compares to 2.4% annual gains over the prior two decades.Even when you strip out the productivity drag from falling capital intensity, which is the amount of capital per worker, the modest lift from the tech sector is clear.Multifactor productivity is the component of productivity growth that serves as ""a measure of innovation's contribution to growth"" because it reflects efficiency gains that aren't directly explained by the capital and labor inputs, explains economist Robert Gordon, a professor at Northwestern University.The digital revolution did help produce a decade of rapid multifactor productivity growth from 1995 to 2004 — an average of 1.4% a year. But ""the acceleration died out quickly because most of the economy had already benefited from the Internet revolution,"" Gordon argues in ""The Rise and Fall of American Growth.""Despite the rise of cloud computing, the app economy and social media over the past decade, multifactor productivity growth slowed to 0.4% a year.As George Mason University economist Tyler Cowen writes, ""While information technology remains the most likely source of future breakthroughs, Silicon Valley has not saved us just yet.""But technology has given entrepreneurs a low-cost platform for innovation. That lets relatively few people do big things. It also helps individuals to connect with people who want what they have to offer — from a spare room (Airbnb) to their back seat (Uber) to a handyman (TaskRabbit).In fact, the augmented reality technology behind Pokemon Go that lets players see Pikachu in their offline environment, is viewed as one likely source of future productivity gains.""AR, despite the Pokemon Go hype, is actually primarily a business tool application that facilitates increased productivity among work groups,"" writes Tim Mulligan of Midia Research.An internal study by Boeing (BA) found that trainees assembling a wing were 30% faster and 90% more accurate on their initial attempt thanks to getting their instructions via augmented reality instead of a desktop computer.Productivity growth was sluggish in the decade after Steve Jobs introduced the Mac. But one innovation built upon another and gave way to the internet era, so it's too early to rule out another productivity boom.

And near-term, Siri is expected to get more play in the Mac world, while Apple lays the groundwork for an Echo competitor.The Echo appliance responds to voice commands and queries with Amazon’s Alexa artificial intelligence technology. An estimated 3 million Echo units have been sold. Google Home, Alphabet’s (GOOGL) answer to Echo, is expected to ship later this year.Apple’s annual WWDC will run June 13 through 17 in San Francisco.

183,MAC,"Regulation: Republicans, eager to hit the ground running if a Republican president is elected in November, have crafted a plan to fix what the current president broke: the banking system. By replacing the failed Dodd-Frank financial reform with something that works, they'll go a long way toward fixing our ailing economy.Dodd-Frank, the massive, 2,300-page law passed in 2010 after the 2008 financial crisis and global market meltdown, was intended to punish Wall Street for its excesses, which supposedly had caused the crisis in the first place. Instead, it ended up putting a wet blanket over the entire financial industry and the economy.In fact, Dodd-Frank was wrongly premised on the idea that ""banking deregulation"" was at the heart of the crisis. But that idea, pushed by Democrats and the media, was 180 degrees wrong. Indeed, there was virtually no deregulation to speak of for banks, contrary to repeated claims by Dodd-Frank proponents. There was extensive re-regulation, and a significant increase in government control and meddling in the run-up to 2008.As it turns out, the real cause of the financial crisis was twofold: government rules put in place to force banks to lend to non-creditworthy borrowers, which ended up costing hundreds of billions of dollars, and a Federal Reserve that only too eagerly kept the financial farce going by holding interest rates too low for too long.""It wasn't deregulation that created the great financial crisis of 2008, it was mostly dumb regulation by the Washington elite,"" House Financial Services Chairman Jeb Hensarling of Texas, who led the effort to reform Dodd-Frank in the House, told the Heritage Foundation's Daily Signal blog.""And there was nothing dumber than those compelling Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to loan money to people for homes they couldn't afford to keep.""So what is the Republicans' plan? It's pretty simple.It would end too-big-to-fail by creating a new kind of bankruptcy for very large banks having more than $50 billion in assets, instead of bailouts. Government loan guarantees would go away. In order to be competitive, larger banks would have to raise more capital — meaning, they would be risking their money, not taxpayers', when they make loans.Yes, it would tighten punishments and boost fines for fraud, insider trading and other financial violations. But it would also neuter the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which has turned into an oppressive, inefficient regulator of the entire consumer financial market.Hensarling gets it. He understands that the left's entire reason for imposing stiff regulations over banking is about control -- not about preventing another meltdown.""The ultimate goal of the left is to turn our large, money-center banks into the functional equivalent of utilities so that Washington can politically allocate credit,"" Hensarling said.The stakes of this reform are enormous. Indeed, many economists believe that the main reason for the economy's growth path shifting downward, from 3% before 2008 to less than 2% currently, is Dodd-Frank.Peter Wallison, who sat on the national commission that investigated the 2008 crisis, noted in a report last year that Dodd Frank's heavy regulatory costs and restrictive lending standards on small banks had ""reduced the ability of these banks to finance small businesses, particularly the startup businesses which are the engine of employment and economic growth.""A report last year by the American Action Forum estimated that Dodd Frank could cost the economy nearly $1 trillion in GDP over 10 years. Reforming Dodd-Frank, it seems, would be a big shot in the arm for the economy.No doubt, the Republican plan to restore sanity to banking will be called ""radical"" by Dodd-Frank supporters and what remains of the press. But it doesn't go far enough. For example, it leaves Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac pretty much intact.Nevertheless, this would be a great start to a new growth-oriented agenda. Want to return to normal growth? Kill Dodd-Frank.

184,MAC,"Microsoft's (MSFT) Windows 10 operating system increased its market share among PCs on the internet in May as the company continues to prod users of older operating systems to take advantage of a free upgrade offer.The percentage of personal computers on the internet using Windows 10 rose to 17.4% in May from 15.3% in April, research firm Net Applications reported Wednesday. The operating system, released 10 months ago, ended 2015 with nearly 10% market share.Microsoft is offering Windows 10 as a free upgrade to users of Windows 7 and 8 machines, but that deal ends on July 29. With sales of new PCs on the decline, Microsoft has been relying on free upgrades to boost the market share for its latest PC operating system.Windows 10 is the second-most-popular PC operating system in use after Windows 7, which had 48.6% market share in May.Versions of Microsoft's Windows OS ran 89.7% of the PCs on the internet in May, Net Applications said. Apple's (AAPL) Mac OS was second with 8.5%, followed by Linux with 1.8%.In recent months, Microsoft has been trying to spur Windows 7 and 8 users to upgrade with a free download. Some journalists have accused Microsoft of using dirty tricks more typical of malware to get people to upgrade.Brad Chacos, senior editor of PCWorld, said Microsoft used deceptive pop-up alerts to trick users to download and install Windows 10. Forbes contributing writer Gordon Kelly said the Windows 10 upgrade tactic is ""borderline malware.""Tech writer Paul Thurrott said Microsoft’s actions with its Get Windows 10 advertisement are a violation of trust that is indefensible. Users who clicked the X on the pop-up ad to close the window were given the upgrade automatically, he said.In a blog post on May 3, Yusuf Mehdi, corporate vice president of Microsoft's Windows and Devices Group, said Windows 10 was on 300 million active devices worldwide.Microsoft shares were down 0.3% at the close Wednesday to 52.85.RELATED:HP Inc.

185,MAC,"We are going to reveal the grand secret to getting rich by investing. It's a simple formula that has worked for Warren Buffett, Carl Icahn and all the greatest investment gurus over the years. Ready?Buy low; sell high.It turns out that Donald Trump has been very, very good at buying low and selling high, and it helps account for his amazing business success.But now Hillary Clinton seems to think it's a crime. Campaigning in California last week she wailed that Trump ""actually said he was hoping for the crash that caused hardworking families in California and across America to lose their homes, all because he thought he could take advantage of it to make some money for himself."" She's assailing Trump for being a good businessman -- something she would know almost nothing about, because she's never actually run a business, though she did miraculously turn $1,000 into $100,000 in the cattle futures market many years ago.Clinton's new TV ads say that Trump predicted the real estate crash in 2006 (good call) and then bought real estate at low prices when the housing crash, which few others foresaw, came in 2008. Many builders went out of business during the crash, but Trump read the market perfectly.What is so hypocritical about the Clinton attacks is that it wasn't Trump but Hillary Clinton, her husband and many of her biggest supporters who were the real culprits here.Before Clinton is able to rewrite this history, let's look at the many ways the Clintons and cronies contributed to the Great Recession.The seeds of the mortgage meltdown were planted during Bill Clinton's presidency.Under Andrew Cuomo, Clinton's secretary of Housing and Urban Development, Community Reinvestment Act regulators gave banks higher ratings for home loans made in credit-deprived areas. Banks were effectively rewarded for throwing out sound underwriting standards and writing loans to those who were at high risk of defaulting. If banks didn't comply with these rules, regulators reined in their ability to expand lending and deposits.These new HUD rules lowered down payments from the traditional 20% to 3% by 1995 and zero down payments by 2000. What's more, in the Clinton push to issue home loans to lower-income borrowers, Fannie and Freddie made it a common practice to virtually end credit documentation, low credit scores were disregarded and income and job history was also thrown aside. The phrase ""subprime"" became commonplace. What an understatement.Next the Clinton administration's rules ordered the taxpayer-backed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to expand their quotas of risky loans from 30% of portfolio to 50%, as part of a big push to expand home ownership. Fannie and Freddie were securitizing these home loans and offering 100% taxpayer guarantees of repayment. So now taxpayers were on the hook for these risky, low down payment loans.Tragically, when prices fell, lower-income folks who really could not afford these mortgages under normal credit standards suffered massive foreclosures and personal bankruptcies. Many will never get credit again. It's a perfect example of liberals using government allegedly to help the poor, with the ultimate consequences being disastrous to them.Additionally, ultra-easy money from the Federal Reserve also played a key role. Rates were held too low for too long from 2002 through 2005, which created asset price bubbles in housing, commodities, gold, oil and elsewhere. When the Fed finally tightened, prices collapsed. So did mortgage collateral (homes) and mortgage bonds that depended on the collateral. Many bond packages were written to please Fannie and Freddie, based on the fantastical idea that home prices would never fall. Fannie and Freddie, by the way, cost the taxpayers $187 billion.Just to make this story worse, Sen. Hillary Clinton and Sen. Barack Obama voted to filibuster a Republican effort to roll back Fannie and Freddie. But on top of all this, while Clinton was propping up Fannie and Freddie, she was taking contributions from their foundations, as a Washington Times report concluded.""Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae's political action committee and individuals linked to the companies donated $75,500 to Mrs. Clinton's senatorial campaign,"" according to the Washington Times. ""Freddie Mac also gave the Clinton Foundation a $50,000 to $100,000 donation.""To be clear, there was plenty of blame to go around among both political parties and the horde of housing lobbyists who helped set up this real estate house of cards. It's a sordid story with plenty of blame all around. And the Fannie/Freddie story is still not solved. It now includes profit sweeping from shareholders to the government, thereby ending any chance to sell the mortgage agencies back to the private sector.Meanwhile, Clinton's attempt to blame Donald Trump is utterly absurd. Buying low and selling high is not against the law. In fact, Trump's investment acumen may serve America well in the not-too-distant future.

186,MAC,"Now that activist investor Bill Ackman's Pershing Square has disclosed a 9.9% stake in Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), the hedge fund might push the embattled fast-casual chain away from discounting and toward, say, branding and breakfast. Or the fund might shake up the company's board. Or Chipotle could find itself on an entirely different -- albeit very unlikely -- path, like, say, getting repurchased by McDonald's (MCD).Such was the range of speculation among analysts a day after Pershing Square disclosed its stake, a move that lifted Chipotle shares 5.9% to 438.45 in the stock market today. After a foodborne-illness scare last year battered the chain's reputation, sales and shares, the stock is now as close to its 200-day line as it's been since last October.In an SEC regulatory filing, Pershing said Chipotle had a ""strong brand"" and ""visionary leadership,"" and that its stock is ""undervalued and is an attractive investment.""The fund said it intended to discuss an array of issues about Chipotle's direction with the company's management as they try to regain consumer trust through menu additions, discounts and loyalty programs. The company's first better-burger location, a Shake Shack (SHAK)-like outfit called Tasty Made, is set to open this fall.While Pershing Square's move makes management a bit more likely to effect changes that would please shareholders, it would also likely mean continued volatility for Chipotle's shares, Nomura analyst Mark Kalinowski said in a note.Meanwhile, Credit Suisse cautioned against refranchising its restaurants to independent owners in attempt to shift the burden of labor and other costs.""The typical activist 'playbook' in restaurants has called for a combination of refranchising, cost-cutting and leverage,"" Credit Suisse analyst Jason West said in a report.""However,"" he continued, ""in our view, these options are less appealing in CMG's case given a high current valuation, lack of franchising historically, and since CMG would be selling stores that are significantly diminished relative to historic peak volumes and profits.""West suggested that Pershing might try to push Chipotle to move away from store growth and discounting -- the latter of which he said investors haven't been keen on -- to focus more on existing restaurants and the Chipotle brand. He also said Pershing could steer Chipotle toward international markets and toward things like breakfast, drive-thrus and more effective digital engagement.Buckingham Research analyst John Zolidis on Wednesday took a more open-ended tack, wondering how Chipotle's problems could be threaded into a concrete investment angle.He wrote that investors have expressed dissatisfaction with a wide range of topics -- slow developments internationally and technologically; complaints around management's structure and compensation; an unsatisfactory response to food-safety issues. But none of those complaints, he said, appeared ""to come together into a coherent, specific course of action that would unlock shareholder value.""While he emphasized that Chipotle's main focus needs to be on regaining trust among diners, he also wondered if McDonald's could end up repurchasing the fast-casual chain.""This idea has been mentioned to us more than once,"" he wrote.The idea is that if McDonald's, once a majority owner of Chipotle before Chipotle grew up to become an archenemy, repurchased the Mexican chain, the burger giant would have a way to keep growing. Moreover, McDonald's has the resources to clear the lanes for Chipotle's international expansion and make it easier to franchise Chipotle's restaurants, he wrote.""Frankly, we believe a McDonald's-Chipotle transaction has peu de chance (little chance)"" he wrote. ""Rather, we mention it in an effort to be comprehensive as we speculate on a possible activist angle for this investment.""IBD'S TAKE: With the U.S. elections and a wave of summer violence making the world a more stressful place, many consumers have been less inspired to eat out.

189,MAC,"With Apple's (AAPL) fiscal-second-quarter earnings report now in the rear-view mirror, investor attention is shifting to what the Cupertino, Calif.-based consumer electronics giant might announce at its upcoming Worldwide Developers Conference.Apple's annual WWDC will run June 13 through 17 in San Francisco. At the conference, Apple’s developer community will gather to learn about the future of Apple’s four software platforms: iOS, OS X, watchOS and tvOS.Wall Street will be closely watching announcements coming from the opening keynote address, which kicks off at 10 a.m. Pacific time on June 13.Based on rumors posted to tech news websites, Apple is likely to unveil a competitor to Amazon.com's (AMZN) Echo smart speaker. Echo is a room appliance that responds to voice commands and queries with the Alexa personal assistant program. Consumers can stream music and get sports scores, news, weather forecasts and other information just by speaking.Apple's me-too product would leverage the company's Siri voice-response program from its mobile devices. At WWDC, Apple is expected to release a software development kit to open up the device to third-party developers.Apple's Echo rival also could include a built-in camera so it can see you in addition to hear you, CNet reported Friday. With facial recognition technology, the Apple device could detect who is in the room and automatically pull up that person's preferences, such as the music and lighting they like, CNet said.One of the big announcements at the keynote is expected to be a sweeping overhaul of Apple Music, a service which was announced at last year's WWDC. Critics faulted Apple Music for being confusing, disjointed and inelegant. Its music offerings are seen as a mishmash of a subscription music service, streaming radio channels and song downloads.Apple is changing the user interface of Apple Music to make it more intuitive, Bloomberg reported this month. Apple also plans to better integrate its streaming and download businesses and expand its online radio service, Bloomberg said.The new version of Apple Music will be fully released as part of iOS 10 this fall.Apple is also expected to unveil the latest version of its Mac personal computer operating system. It is expected to change the nomenclature to MacOS from OS X, according to a report from 9to5Mac.Apple currently uses California locations to brand new Mac operating system releases. It started this trend with Mavericks in 2013 and followed with Yosemite in 2014 and El Capitan in 2015.At WWDC, Apple will also show off the latest versions of its Apple Watch and Apple TV operating systems. Software changes often signal changes to hardware.With Apple's heightened focus on services to drive incremental revenue and profit, the company is likely to play up services like Apple Pay, Apple Music, iCloud and the App Store at the conference.RELATED:Apple Shakes Off Concerns About Becoming The Next BlackBerryApple Has Largest Cash Stockpile, Twice That Of Microsoft’s.

190,MAC,"GameStop (GME) stock tumbled on Friday, a day after the video game retailer delivered better-than-expected fiscal-first-quarter earnings but disappointed investors with its current-quarter guidance.GameStop shares were down nearly 4%, to 28.80, at the close on the stock market today. GameStop stock hit a nearly three-year low of 24.33 in January on concerns that the shift to the digital distribution of video games was eroding its core business model of selling games on physical media.GameStop earned 66 cents a share excluding items on sales of $1.97 billion in the quarter ended April 30. Sales were in line with views, but EPS topped analysts' estimates by 4 cents. On a year-over-year basis, earnings per share fell 3% and sales fell 4%.The Grapevine, Texas-based company said same-store sales fell 6.2%.For the current quarter, GameStop expects EPS of 23 to 30 cents vs. Wall Street's target of 36 cents and compared to 31 cents in the year-earlier quarter.GameStop's Q1 results were helped by the company's diversification efforts. In addition to its flagship video game business, the company also sells pop-culture collectibles through ThinkGeek, as well Apple (AAPL) products at its Simply Mac stores and AT&T (T) wireless devices and services at its Spring Mobile and Cricket shops.GameStop’s non-physical gaming businesses accounted for 18.6% of revenue in Q1, but it contributed 29.5% of gross profit dollars.Video game hardware, software and accessories accounted for about 81% of sales in the first quarter. Mobile and consumer electronics accounted for 10% of sales, and collectibles contributed 4% of sales. Digital game downloads and other categories made up the rest.Oppenheimer analyst Brian Nagel said he is “increasingly optimistic” about GameStop’s prospects longer-term, given its diversification. Investors, however, probably will take a wait-and-see attitude toward the shift.“Our most significant hesitation in recommending shares is our concern that the market might not begin to value the company's shifting revenue and profit streams for some time,” Nagel said in a research report Friday. He rates GameStop stock as perform, or hold.GameStop doesn't see its core video game business returning to growth this year. It is forecasting game hardware sales down 10% this year, with new game software sales down 5% to 10%, and pre-owned games flat.However, virtual reality headsets and new consoles are ""wildcards"" for possible growth in the video game business, GameStop Chief Financial Officer Rob Lloyd told IBD.Sony (SNE) and Microsoft (MSFT) are rumored to be coming out with mid-cycle console upgrades later this year and could announce them at the E3 conference next month. Nintendo (NTDOY) plans to launch a new console, the Nintendo NX, next spring.As for virtual reality, GameStop is demonstrating the HTC Vive headset in 10 stores now and plans to add 40 more locations in the next few months. GameStop is taking orders for the $799 VR headset at those stores.GameStop also is in talks with Facebook (FB)-owned Oculus about selling the Oculus Rift virtual-reality headset, Lloyd said.A third major VR product, Sony’s PlayStation VR, is set for release in October.With the video game business in the doldrums, GameStop is aggressively ramping up its diversification efforts.“On the technology brand side, we’ve doubled the store count in that business in just over a year,"" Lloyd said. ""And we’ve got two acquisitions we expect to close by the end of this quarter, and those two will grow it again by another 50%.”GameStop now operates about 1,000 tech brand stores and just under 6,000 video game shops. It also has 38 stores dedicated to selling collectibles such as T-shirts, action figures and other geek gear related to movies, TV shows and comic books.RELATED:Britney Spears Game Lifts Glu, But Big Publishers WinningTake-Two’s ‘Grand Theft Auto’ Still Has Gas In The Tank.

191,MAC,"Investors this week learned to stop worrying and love the rate hike. Even as Fed officials and fresh economic data bolstered the case for a summer interest rate increase, stocks rallied. Apple (AAPL) and banks continued to climb, while energy stocks took heart from $50 oil. Top-rated Ulta Beauty (ULTA) and deep-discount stores shrugged off retail earnings woes. Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) kept spinning. Alibaba (BABA) disclosed an SEC accounting probe, while Alphabet (GOOGL) and Bank of America (BAC) won key court battles.Odds for a Federal Reserve rate increase at the June or July meetings continued to climb, but stocks rallied. The Nasdaq rose 3.4%, the S&P 500 2.3% and the Dow industrials 2.1%, with all three regaining their 50-day lines as the market direction returned to a confirmed uptrend. Apple advanced 5.4% after climbing 5.2% last week. Financial and energy stocks also rallied, with the latter rising along with oil prices. U.S. crude oil futures briefly topped $50 a barrel Thursday, a seven-month high, as U.S. inventories and production fell. Crude rose 3.3% for the week to $49.33.Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen, who has been among the more dovish policymakers publicly in recent months, said Friday that raising rates cautiously would be ""appropriate"" in the coming months as the economy continues to improve. Earlier in the week, San Francisco Fed President John Williams said he sees two or three rate hikes this year, with three or four more next year. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard reiterated that the U.S. job market is tight and may start to push inflation higher -- cause for another rate hike. Fed Gov. Jerome Powell said the benchmark rate could go up soon, but weak productivity growth could curb further increases.While odds of a rate hike at the June policy meeting are about 33%, the chances for at least one quarter-point hike by the July meeting are above 60%.Economic data largely backed calls for a rate hike. New-home sales spiked 16.6% to an eight-year high, while pending-home sales shot up to their best level in 10 years. Durable goods orders rose 3.4% on soaring aircraft demand, but the report also showed core capital goods bookings slid to a five-year low.In the coming week, May data on manufacturing (ISM index), U.S. auto sales and employment may lock in expectations for or against a Fed rate hike.Automaker-tech pairings continued. Toyota (TM) said it will invest an undisclosed amount in Uber after last year disclosing plans to invest $1 billion in R&D on self-driving cars. Toyota will offer auto leases to Uber drivers. BMW i Ventures said it will invest in Scoop Technologies, creator of the Scoop carpooling mobile app. Volkswagen (VLKAY) will invest $300 million in Gett, an Uber rival in Europe and New York City. The trio join Apple, which in early May said it would invest $1 billion in top China ride-hailing service Didi Chuxing as it reportedly works in secret on an Apple Car project. (Didi itself is backed by Alibaba and Tencent (TCEHY), while Uber partners in China with Baidu (BIDU)). Also, General Motors (GM) in January said it would invest $500 million in Lyft, an Uber rival.The specialty beauty retailer continues to be an outperformer among a field of retail disappointments. Ulta Beauty notched a 39% EPS gain -- the biggest in three years -- on 24% revenue growth to $1.07 billion, way above views. Ulta also amped up its full-year outlook. Q2 guidance was mixed. More retailers are scheduled to report this week. Shares rose 11.8% for the week, mostly on Friday's post-earnings jump.IBD's Take: How beautiful is Ulta's stock based on IBD criteria, and does it stand out vs. rivals? Find out at IBD Stock CheckupDollar-or-less variety store chains Dollar General (DG) and Dollar Tree (DLTR) crushed first-quarter earnings estimates Thursday amid strong expansion. Dollar General reported a 23% EPS gain and plans to open 900 new stores this year. Dollar Tree reported a 25% EPS advance. One troubling sign was that both fell short of Wall Street revenue targets. Still, Dollar Tree CEO Bob Sasser said he was generally pleased with the company’s performance in “what continues to be a challenging economic environment.”Dollar General stock leapt 10.1% this week, and Dollar Tree gained 15.7%, both breaking out to new highs.Alibaba disclosed an ongoing SEC investigation into potential violations regarding the e-commerce giant’s transaction and consolidation practices, as well as its operating data from Singles Day, the Chinese company’s most lucrative shopping day of the year.Shares plunged 6.8% Wednesday, Alibaba’s worst one-day percentage decline in more than a year. But Alibaba ended 2.8% higher this week.Evercore, Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank analysts all said they remained positive on the stock.Hewlett Packard Enterprise said it would spin off its Enterprise Services business and merge it with Computer Services Corp. (CSC), a move the company said would create a $26 billion global IT behemoth. HPE, itself a spin-off of Hewlett-Packard, also kept its full-year EPS guidance above views.HPE stock rose 15.1% for the week. Computer Sciences spiked nearly 41% to a six-month high.Bank of America, Citigroup (C), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and other big banks are back on the hook for a potentially crippling sum of cash after a U.S. appeals court overturned a 2013 lower-court ruling against antitrust lawsuits that alleged the banks rigged Libor and hurt investors. The lower court found the plaintiffs didn’t show sufficient harm, but the appeals court felt the opposite. Now the lower court will deliberate further on the matter and decide whether the plaintiffs are justified to sue at all.That same appeals court overturned a $1.27 billion suit against Bank of America that alleged the bank’s Countrywide Financial misled mortgage giants Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FMCC) on loan sales in the run-up to the financial crisis. The court said Countrywide’s actions were likelier to fall under ""breach of contract"" rather than outright fraud. The court also dismissed a civil suit against Rebecca Mairone, who was once an executive at Countrywide.A jury ruled that Alphabet's Google didn't need approval from Oracle (ORCL) to use the latter's programming tools -- APIs -- to build Android, the world's leading mobile operating system. Oracle had sought $9 billion in damages and possible additional royalties, saying Google violated its copyrights. But the jury said the Alphabet unit exercised fair use. Oracle said it will appeal.Alphabet stock rose 3.6% for the week, closing back above its 50-day moving average.Monsanto (MON) agreed that a deal with Bayer (BAYRY) made financial sense, but the agriculture giant rejected the $122 per share, or $62 billion offer, saying it was worth more money. But it also said it was open to more talks. Bayer said it looks to further talks with Monsanto and said it could address potential financing and regulatory issues. Monsanto stock rose 7.85% to 109.49. Bayer fell 5% to a 3-year low.Gannett (GCI)  threatened to withdraw its $15 per share offer for Tribune Publishing (TPUB) after the the owner of the L.A. Times and Chicago Tribune issued 4.7 million new shares and sold them to Nant Capital. The investment firm Towle, which controls 3.85% of Tribune shares, blasted the move and said it supports an acquisition by Gannett.Tribune Publishing stock dived 20.9% after spiking 24% in the prior week. Gannett stock fell 3.2%.Palo Alto Networks (PANW) guided to $386 million to $390 million in fiscal Q3 sales and 48-50 cents earnings per share ex items, missing the midpoints of the consensus model of $389.3 million and 50 cents. The No. 2 cybersecurity firm's fiscal Q2 sales grew 48% year over year to $345.8 million, topping Wall Street for $339.5 million. Q2 EPS shot up 83%, though that merely met analyst forecasts.Palo Alto shares dived 8.4% this week after crumbling 12.4% on Friday.Tiffany (TIF) reported Q1 EPS fell 14.8% to 69 cents but beat views by a penny. Sales fell 7.4% to $891.3 million, under views for $915.1 million. European and Asia-Pacific same-store sales were down 15%, while Americas unit comps were down 10% on lower tourist spending.

Revenue climbed 3.3% to $1.58 billion, but fell short of views for $1.61 billion. Same-store sales were up 2.4%. For Q2, Signet, which owns the Zales, Kay and Jared mall-based jewelry chains, sees EPS of $1.49 to $1.54 vs. analyst estimates for $1.52. It also projects comps growth under analysts' forecasts.Signet stock fell 7.1%.

192,MAC,"Ulta Beauty (ULTA) reports after the close of regular trade Thursday. The specialty beauty retailer has already experienced a 49% year-to-date rise in share price, so can investors expect more gains from an already high-flying stock?Earnings and revenue are each expected to rise 21% -- to $1.39 per share and $1.06 billion, respectively -- according to analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. That would be consistent with growth rates of quarters past.Its stock has been climbing steadily higher, and Ulta shares often spike after earnings results: They rose 9.1% the day after its Q1 report in May, spiked 17.3% the session after its Q4 report in March, and popped 12.8% in one day after its Q3 results in December.The beauty-product seller fell 1.4% to 270.70 in the stock market today after hitting a record high on Friday. On Monday, Piper Jaffray raised its price target on Ulta to 290 from 250. Shares haven't dipped below their key 50-day or 200-day moving averages since the stock's post-Q4 gap-up in March.The experts on Wall Street will be particularly interested in both Ulta's loyalty program membership figures and same-store sales growth, two areas that have been strong performers.Ulta's sales at stores open for at least a year have far outpaced the broader retail landscape. The company reported 15.2% comparable-store growth in Q1, preceded sequentially by 12.5% comps in Q4 and by 12.8% comps in the quarter before that. Thursday's same-store sales will come on top of Q2 2015's 10.1% comps.By contrast, the 63 retailers that have reported earnings so far this season collectively have same-store sales growth of 1.1%, according to Retail Metrics.Driving Ulta's appeal are several factors, including an increased consumer interest in beauty products and only one major rival in the specialty beauty retail space.Beauty is the one of the fastest-growing segments in retail, NPD Group analyst Karen Grant told IBD. And ""prestige"" products -- think higher-priced products from brands like MAC and Urban Decay -- are proving to be popular, outpacing the ""mass"" or drugstore brands by sales growth in 2015.LVMH (LVMUY)-owned Sephora is Ulta's primary competition, although the two companies differ in strategy. Sephora is a prestige-only shop, while Ulta carries both high-end labels, as well as drugstore brands such as Revlon and L'Oreal.IBD'S TAKE: It can be tough to figure out when to let go of a stock, especially when shares are climbing higher. But this profit-taking rule can help fill in the ""Missing Chapter.'' So is now a good time for investors to hop on? Or is it too late to get in on this hot retail name?Piper Jaffray analyst Steph Wissink in a Monday note laid out the argument for Ulta's valuation.""The mega trends in beauty provide a highly compelling backdrop for growth; Ulta's position is increasingly favored among consumers and brands; and the defensibility of the model is becoming increasingly clear as the mix of prestige and mass brands coupled with a growing list of service elements is differentiated,"" she wrote.RELATED:Can Ulta Beauty And Veeva Systems Keep Win Streaks Intact?

193,MAC,"McDonald's (MCD) and Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) showed bearish action on the stock market Friday, as investors remained somewhat squeamish about restaurant trends generally.McDonald's fell 1.8% to 115.01 on Friday, hitting the lowest level in six months. It was the weakest close since early December. McDonald's is still struggling from reporting weaker-than-expected Q2 U.S. comps, partly due to broader consumer weakness. The all-day breakfast menu introduced late last year had fueled a turnaround, but investors are worried about growth drivers as comparisons get tougher.Meanwhile, McDonald's faces rising labor costs due to minimum-wage hikes and the company's own wage increases. Rising costs and weaker comps will squeeze margins, said Argus Research last week as it downgraded McDonald's.IBD'S TAKE: Rising labor costs are a problem for fast-food chains generally. Fast-food prices have never risen so fast vs. the cost of eating at home.  Chipotle Mexican Grill retreated 1.6% to 388.50, a three-year closing low. Chipotle is still trying to recover from last year's food-borne illness outbreaks. It's introduced a new menu item -- chorizo sausage -- and introduced its first loyalty program, Chiptopia. Chipotia is generous but complicated, so it's unclear how many people will use it aggressively and whether they'll keep dining at Chipotle in October.Starbucks (SBUX) fell 1.1% to its lowest level in nearly two months. Like McDonald's, Starbucks reported weak U.S. comps for its latest quarter but said that was an anomaly, vowing improvement. Still, a few days after the earnings report Starbucks stock met resistance at the 200-day line and began retreating, falling through its 50-day average as well.On the upside, Domino's Pizza (PZZA) and Papa John's (PZZA) have delivered strong results, sending shares to highs.Jack in the Box (JACK) spiked after its earnings report earlier this month and is now trading just below its all-time high of 99.99 set in March 2015. Notably, Jack in the Box owns Qdoba Mexican Eats, a rival chain to Chipotle.RELATED:

194,MAC,"Apple (AAPL) is expected to introduce three new iPads in 2017, followed by significant changes to the portable device in 2018.Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo at KGI Securities, in a research note, said he expects Apple to introduce three new iPads: a 12.9-inch iPad Pro 2, 10.5-inch iPad Pro and a low-cost 9.7-inch iPad. KGI Securities is a wholly owned subsidiary of China Development Financial.Kuo predicts ""revolutionary"" and ""radical"" changes for the iPad in 2018 that will include a shift to active-matrix organic light-emitting diode (AMOLED) flexible displays, as reported by MacRumors and others. He also expects changes in form factor design.""We believe iPad will follow in the footsteps of the iPhone by adopting AMOLED panels in 2018 at the earliest,"" Kuo wrote. ""If Apple can truly tap the potential of a flexible AMOLED panel, we believe the new iPad model will offer new selling points through radical form factor design and user behavior changes, which could benefit shipments.""Kuo remains cautious in his predictions of iPad shipments due to a current lack of new models. He lowered his 2016 shipment forecast for iPads to a range of 35 million to 45 million units this year, down from 45 million to 50 million. But even with newly updated models in 2017, however, Kuo predicts tablet shipments will continue to decline as part of ongoing trends in the market.Apple stock finished the trading day up 1.2% to 109.48 on the stock market today. Apple stock is up 4% this year.IBD'S Take: With company sales declining in the past two quarters year over year, Apple needs new products to drive growth. The N in IBD's CAN SLIM Investing System stands for ""new,"" such as new products, services or management that can help drive profits and share prices higher.Apple is also planning a long-overdue upgrade to its MacBook Pro line of notebook computers.

The new laptops will be thinner, have an OLED touch-screen strip for function keys and offer more powerful graphics processors, the article said.IBD'S TAKE: Apple stock has a below-average IBD Composite Rating of 45, meaning it has been outperformed by 55% of stocks in key metrics over the last 12 months.

196,MAC,"Apple (AAPL) stock earned a price target hike from RBC Capital Markets on Thursday on expectations that iPhone sales growth will return in the December quarter.RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani reiterated his outperform rating on Apple and increased his price target to 117 from 115. Apple fell 0.1% to 107.93 in the stock market today. Apple stock had a five-day up-streak going, reaching a nearly four-month high, before falling a fraction on Wednesday.Daryanani upped his forecast for iPhone unit sales in the December quarter, based on the understanding that Apple's fiscal first quarter will include an extra week of sales. Fiscal Q1 will have 14 weeks vs. the normal 13 weeks, he said.The extra week will result in about 5 million to 6 million incremental iPhone unit sales in the December quarter, Daryanani said in a research note. He now forecasts Apple will sell 79 million iPhones in the period, up 6% year over year. Apple's fiscal Q1 is expected to be the first full quarter of iPhone 7 sales.He believes Apple stock will climb higher over the foreseeable future because of easier year-over-year comparisons, new product launches and stable-to-improving gross profit margins.IBD'S TAKE: Apple has not been a top-performing stock for about a year now, but it does rank No. 2 in its industry group. For a look at the good and the bad of Apple, or any stock, check out IBD's Stock Checkup.The extra week of sales in Q1 also should boost iPad, Mac and services revenue as well, Daryanani said.Others are Wall Street are more bearish on Apple's prospects.Steve Grasso, director of institutional sales at Stuart Frankel, told CNBC on Wednesday that Apple is a poor investment choice now.""I think it's going to underperform perpetually,"" Grasso said.

197,MAC,"The Summer Games aren't just a noble gathering of the world's athletic elite: The event is also a marketing gold mine for official brand partners and sponsors of individual athletes.And perhaps more so in 2016 than in prior Olympic years, trying to harness the life force of the internet can lead to unpredictable results, thanks to an often-rowdy digital commentariat on Facebook (FB), Twitter (TWTR), Snapchat and elsewhere. Brands can emerge from the melee as social-media stars or as sore losers.So here's a glimpse at how Coca-Cola (KO), McDonald's (MCD), Nike (NKE) and others are performing in Rio so far:Not Coke's fault, but the soft drink giant got mixed up in a PR debacle when an Olympian from Egypt told NPR that there was no coffee in the Olympic Village, because it was a Coca-Cola-only zone.The story went semi-viral. The New York Daily News, Business Insider, Fusion and others picked up on the NPR segment -- Cosmopolitan even grouped it under a listicle called ""11 Rio Olympic Village Horror Stories.""Spokespeople from Coca-Cola, an official worldwide sponsor of the Games, told several of those outlets that no, the athletes aren't limited to Coke products and yes, there is coffee in Olympic Village, but the damage had been done.That's probably not what gold feels like.Shares rose 0.3% to 43.75 on the stock market today. Coca-Cola stock has been trading below its 200-day average since reporting Q2 results late last month.The Big Mac maker is doing lots of feel-good stuff around the Olympics -- it sent kids to the opening ceremony! Its McNuggets are pink-slime-free! -- but you can trust hungry, tired reporters to weed out the real news: there's no McDonald's in Olympic Park.According to USA Today, Olympiads of years past have prominently featured a McD's in the press center. But McDonald's told the paper that it wanted to get into the local spirit and feature dessert stands instead, of which there are 2,500 in Brazil.There is, however, a full-service McDonald's in Olympic Village. And it is very, very popular with the athletes.Line out the door at McDonald's in Olympic Athletes Village (via @JohnBranchNYT) pic.twitter.com/HJQrxqcP2k— Darren Rovell (@darrenrovell) August 9, 2016Shares rose 0.5% to 119.38 Thursday.

200,MAC,"Purchases of new homes in the U.S. surged in April to the highest level since the start of 2008, pointing to a robust spring selling season for builders.Sales jumped 16.6% to a 619,000 annualized pace, and purchases in the first three months of the year were revised higher, Commerce Department data showed Tuesday. The rate exceeded the most optimistic forecast in a Bloomberg survey. The median sales price climbed to a record, reflecting a pickup in signed contracts for more expensive properties.The rebound in purchases signals housing was returning to more stable footing, helped by healthy employment gains and cheap borrowing costs. The number of homes sold and not yet under construction climbed to the highest level since May 2007, indicating homebuilding will help add to economic growth.“The spring selling season is off to a decent start,” Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody’s Analytics Inc. in West Chester, Pa., said before the report. “I think it’ll add more to growth this year than it has in the past several.”The median forecast in the Bloomberg survey called for the rate to accelerate to 523,000, with estimates ranging from 508,000 to 533,000. The Commerce Department revised the March reading up to a 531,000 pace from a previously estimated 511,000.The report, which is volatile month to month, said there was 90% confidence the change in sales last month ranged from a 1.2% gain to a 32% increase. With Tuesday’s release, the Commerce Department revised data back to January 2014.The gain in demand last month was paced by the South, where sales climbed 15.8% to a 352,000 annual rate, the strongest since December 2007. Purchases rebounded in the West and climbed in the Northeast.The supply of homes fell to 4.7 months from 5.5 months in March. There were 243,000 new houses on the market at the end of April, little changed from a month earlier.The median sales price of a new house increased 9.7% from April 2015 to a record $321,100. Purchases climbed for dwellings priced at $300,000 or more.New-home sales, which account for about 10% of the residential market, are tabulated when contracts are signed. That makes them a timelier barometer than transactions on existing homes.Previously owned homes sold in April at the fastest pace in three months, led by a surge in the Midwest, National Association of Realtors data showed last week. Closings advanced 1.7% to a 5.45 million annual rate. Prices climbed from April 2015 as the number of dwellings on the market fell from a year earlier.The residential real estate market is benefiting from solid job growth and low interest rates, while limited inventory keeps prices elevated.The jobless rate was 5% in April, lingering near an eight-year low reached earlier this year, and employers added 160,000 workers to their payrolls.The average rate on a 30-year, fixed mortgage was 3.58% in the week ended May 19, just above the record-low 3.31% reached in 2012, according to Freddie Mac figures dating to 1971.

201,MAC,"University of Missouri at St. Louis criminologist Richard Rosenfeld has had ""second thoughts."" Like many academic criminologists, he had pooh-poohed charges that skyrocketing murder rates in many cities in 2015 and 2016 are the result of a ""Ferguson effect"" -- a skittering back from proactive policing for fear of accusations of racism, like those that followed the death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., in August 2014.Now, after looking over 2015 data from 56 large cities, he's changed his mind. Homicides in those cities were up 17% from 2014. And 10 cities, all with large black populations, saw homicides up 33% on average.""These aren't flukes or blips, this is a real increase,"" Rosenfeld said. ""The only explanation that gets the timing right is a version of the Ferguson effect.""Rosenfeld thus parts company with the liberal Brennan Center, whose analysts argued that the 2015 homicide increase in large cities was not a ""national pandemic."" He parts company also with FiveThirtyEight analyst Carl Bialik, who dismissed a 16% homicide increase in 59 of the 60 largest cities in 2014 and 2015 as ""a less dire picture than the one painted by reports in several large media outlets.""But a 16% or 17% increase in homicides in major cities that account for a large share of the national murder toll is, in historical perspective, very dire indeed. The most accurate word is ""unprecedented."" The only double-digit increases in national murder statistics going back to 1960 are 13% (in 1968), 11% (in 1966, 1967 and 1971) and 10% (in 1979).As anyone familiar with the workings of compound interest might guess, such increases rapidly added up. The total number of homicides nationally more than doubled between 1966 and 1979. The number peaked in 1991.During those years, most academic criminologists argued that high rates of violent crime resulted from economic distress and -- noting that nearly half of murders were committed by blacks -- from the endemic racism in American society. Today the Brennan Center echoes this analysis: ""Economic deterioration of those cities could be a contributor to murder increases.""Political scientist James Wilson and maverick criminologist George Kelling dissented from this view. In their 1982 Atlantic article, ""Broken Windows,"" they argued that proactive policing and elimination of signs of disorder (like broken windows) could sharply reduce crime rates.In the 1990s, New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani and Police Commissioner Bill Bratton put the ""broken windows"" theory into effect. Their proactive policing tactics were continued by Mayor Michael Bloomberg and widely imitated and adapted around the country.The result was that homicides in New York were reduced from 2,445 in 1990 to 328 in 2014. Nationally, the number of murders declined 42% from 1991 to 2014.The definitive chronicler of proactive policing, the Manhattan Institute's Heather Mac Donald, spotlighted the Ferguson effect in a Wall Street Journal article in May 2015. She noted that arrests were sharply down in cities such as St. Louis and Baltimore because the ""incessant drumbeat against the police"" across the country had ""officers scale back on proactive policing under the onslaught of anti-cop rhetoric.""Those encouraging such rhetoric include President Obama and his first attorney general, Eric Holder -- even though an intensive Justice Department investigation of Brown's killing in Ferguson cleared the officer involved and made clear that charges that Brown had put up his hands and surrendered were baseless.Obama has since said that ""there's no data to support"" a Ferguson effect. That puts him at odds with his appointee, FBI Director James Comey, who says that his conversations with police officials around the country convinced him that there are ""marginal pullbacks by lots and lots of police officers."" It also put Obama at odds with Rosenfeld, who has found clear evidence of ""de-policing"" in Baltimore and Chicago, where homicides have spiked.The charge of cherry-picking data and misleading rhetoric can more justifiably be leveled against administration officials and mainstream media, who, after the Ferguson killing, created the impression of a rising epidemic of racist police officers shooting innocent blacks. The few such cases have received prompt and stern attention from local law enforcement.Black Americans were the primary victims of the huge crime increase starting in the late 1960s, and they will be the primary victims again if the Ferguson effect continues to result in more homicides. Can't we prevent this awful history from repeating itself?
"
202,MAC,"Housing: Seemingly everyone applauds the recent surge in home prices as a positive sign for the economy. But, in fact, it isn't. If anything, it's a sign the federal government still hasn't learned its lesson about excessive regulation.While prices for homes have surged in recent years, they've done so thanks mainly to federal regulations put in place after the financial crisis. Low interest rates engineered by the Fed to stimulate the economy have fueled a surge in demand, driving prices up sharply. And federal regulations continue to require mortgage lenders to make risky home loans based on race and ethnicity, not creditworthiness -- just as they did in the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac market bubble of 2006.On the surface, it seems puzzling: The homeownership rate plunged to just above 63% in the first quarter of this year, down from a peak of 69% in the third quarter of 2006. And yet, over just the last four years prices have surged 30% or more across much of the country. How can long-term demand be falling and prices rising at the same time?For one thing, homebuilders, wary of the growing layers of regulation and the possibility of another market crash, just aren't building homes as they once did. As we noted in a recent editorial, the 2010 Dodd-Frank law, perhaps the biggest regulatory mistake of our generation, has acted as a wet blanket not just on the housing market but on the entire economy.In that editorial, we quoted American Enterprise Institute housing expert Peter Wallison, who served as a member of the federal government’s official investigation into the financial crisis: “Dodd-Frank was enacted by Congress without any significant effort to understand what actually caused the financial crisis.” Exactly. It was regulation for regulation's sake.Wallison wants Dodd Frank to be repealed, arguing that the housing market meltdown and subsequent financial crisis in 2007-2008 “was principally the result of the U.S. government’s housing policies,” not a lack of regulation.Utah Sen. Mike Lee, in a recent commentary, maintains that home prices are soaring not because of healthy housing demand, but because of ""government regulations (that) artificially inflate the cost of building new units.""He's got a point. A recent study by the National Association of Home Builders estimated that regulatory costs have surged 30% in just the last five years, thanks to the Obama administration's heavy-handed regulatory response to the financial crisis.And it's about to get worse. A whole new raft of regulations are in the works, distorting the housing market further with growing risks to our economy.The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau last October implemented a new Dodd-Frank rule that requires extensive new ""compliance"" forms and waiting periods for each mortgage deal. As the Heritage Foundation's John Ligon wrote earlier this year, ""The 2010 Dodd-Frank Act confuses endless red tape for effective reform of housing finance.""Meanwhile, the Department of Housing and Urban Development has issued a new rule with the innocuous title, ""Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing."" In fact, says Sen. Lee, this innocent sounding rule is nothing less than an attempt by the Obama administration to put in place a national zoning board with control over local neighborhoods.""If they don't believe your neighborhood is 'diverse' enough, they will seize control of local zoning decisions -- choosing what should be built, where, and who should pay for it -- in order to make your neighborhood look more like they want it to,"" Lee wrote.Enough. Dodd-Frank is a bad law that has had awful consequences. So let us repeat: It's time to end this nation's failed experiment with top-down government control of housing, and let markets once again do the job that they do best. If not, we may soon face a housing-related financial crisis worse than the last one.

203,MAC,"Apple (AAPL) saw its share of personal-computer operating systems in use on the Internet rise to a new high in April, Net Applications reported Sunday.Apple’s Mac operating systems collectively accounted for 9.2% of PCs online last month, up from 7.8% in March. Net Applications cautioned that the April data is preliminary.Still, Apple’s percentage of PCs in use on the Internet has been on the rise for several years. Its previous high was 8% in October. About year ago, in April 2015, Mac OS claimed 7.4% usage share.Net Applications data go back to November 2007, when Windows had 95.9% market share and Mac claimed just 3.4%.Conversely, Microsoft (MSFT) has seen its stranglehold on the PC market loosen. Its usage share of the PC market fell below 90% for the first time last month.Windows accounted for 89.2% of PCs on the Internet in April, down from 90.5% in March, Net Applications said.The top version of the Mac OS in use is Mac OS X 10.11, called El Capitan. It garnered 4% of the PC market in April, Net Applications said.The growth in Mac usage last month comes as the company is experiencing a decline in Mac sales.Last Tuesday, Apple said unit sales of Mac computers fell 12% year over year in the March quarter. It is only the second time in the last 28 quarters that Macs have failed to beat the growth rate of the overall PC market, Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi said in a report Monday.

204,MAC,"Restaurant Brands International (QSR) on Thursday reported a drop in same-restaurant sales at Burger King's U.S. and Canada locations for the first time in some three years, an analyst noted, as restaurants nationwide struggle with deepening customer anxieties.But the fast-food giant said it remained confident about its direction and didn't offer much commentary about the state of the consumer.McDonald's (MCD) and Starbucks (SBUX) have described uncertainties stemming from global upheaval, high-profile shootings, terrorist attacks and a chaotic election season. But Restaurant Brands wasn't as introspective, with management noting increased competition and repeating the common refrain of a challenging environment.""The industry changes from time to time,"" CEO Daniel Schwartz said on the company's earnings call. ""We try to get too focused on macroeconomic changes.""Same-restaurant sales growth at Burger King locations in the U.S. and Canada fell 0.8%. The last time comps in that region fell into negative territory was 2013, Stephens analyst Will Slabaugh said in a research note.With the exception of Burger King's Asia-Pacific regions, comps slowed across the board for Burger King and Tim Hortons, which Restaurant Brands also owns.Overall, same-restaurant sales at Burger King rose 0.6%, slowing considerably from 6.7% growth a year earlier. Comps at Tim Hortons slowed to 2.7% from 5.5% growth.Top- and bottom-line results were mixed during the second quarter. Total revenue edged down to $1.04 billion, compared to analysts' expectations for $1.043 billion. The stronger U.S. dollar weighed on revenue. Earnings per share rose 38% to 41 cents, topping estimates for 34 cents.Restaurant Brands shares closed up 3.4% at 46.31 in the stock market today, just above buy territory after breaking out last month. McDonald's edged up 0.7%, and Starbucks lost 0.9%. Jack In The Box (JACK), which reported strong quarterly results late Wednesday, jumped 10.6%. Wendy's (WEN) added 2%.IBD'S TAKE: Competitive discounting, potential overexpansion and consumer unease have hurt sales across much of the restaurant sector. However, Restaurant Brands' stock is one of the few in the sector to stay above its key 50-day line. Compare and contrast industry players at IBD's Stock Checkup.Restaurant Brands has tried to shift toward more of a franchisee-led model, which shifts more expenses from corporate onto independent restaurant operators.While fast-casual rival Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) has tried to keep its menu simple, Restaurant Brands has in recent months has tried to brighten up its offering with occasional new products. Tim Hortons has launched iced coffee drinks and steak sandwiches. Burger King, meanwhile, has introduced grilled hot dogs and and Mac n' Cheetos.

207,MAC,"In 1906, Leonor Loree, an accomplished railroad executive, examined the dilapidated Kansas City Southern Railroad that he had been hired to rehabilitate. Dismayed, he permanently enriched American slang by exclaiming: ""This is a helluva way to run a railroad!"" Judge Janice Rogers Brown of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, the nation's second-most important court, recently said, with judicial decorousness, essentially the same thing about Amtrak.She was not referring to its 46 consecutive years of operating losses, which include $306 million last year, and more than $16 billion since 1970, when Congress created Amtrak as a federally chartered, for-profit corporation. Rather, Brown was referring to how Congress, by piling ""anomaly on top of anomaly,"" has made Amtrak into a ""wholly unique statutory creature"" -- one empowered to regulate its competitors. Amtrak illustrates the administrative state's routine drift into constitutional impropriety.In 2008, Congress passed the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act (PRIIA), which endowed Amtrak with the powers of a regulatory agency that makes decisions, in conjunction with the Department of Transportation, about scheduling, uses of available tracks, maintenance and other metrics and standards that compel certain behavior by the entire U.S. rail industry. Freight rail entities, which actually are private, understandably objected, and the D.C. Circuit agreed with them that PRIIA was an unconstitutional delegation of governmental regulatory power to a private entity.In 2015, however, the Supreme Court issued a through-the-looking-glass ruling worthy of Lewis Carroll's Humpty Dumpty (""When I use a word, it means just what I choose it to mean -- neither more nor less""). The court acknowledged that Congress has designated Amtrak a private corporation directed to maximize revenues in order to minimize the need for government subsidies. So, Amtrak is required to be self-interested. Yet the court held that because Amtrak is indirectly controlled by Congress, however remotely, it can also be considered a government entity.Passive courts, accommodating the administrative state's activities, are permissive about agencies' regulatory behavior that blurs the line between legislation and regulation. But the Supreme Court returned freight operators' challenge to the D.C. Circuit for answers to some remaining questions, including this one implicating the Fifth Amendment's due process guarantee: May an economically self-interested entity exercise regulatory authority over competitors?Writing for a unanimous three-judge panel, Brown rejected ""a simple way to resolve this case,"" refusing to adopt the naive hypothesis that ""Amtrak's political accountability -- remote as it is -- removes the taint of any potential for bias."" Instead, Brown wrote: ""Our Constitution's ingenious system of checks and balances assumes government officials will act self-interestedly.""She cited Alexander Hamilton from the first Federalist Paper: It would be nice if government officials' decisions would always be ""unbiased by considerations not connected with the public good,"" but this is something ""more ardently to be wished than seriously to be expected.""Regarding Amtrak, Brown noted, ""Congress delegated its legislative power to an entity that it designed to be the opposite of 'presumptively disinterested.'"" Among the chief concerns of the Framers of the Constitution ""were questions of who should be permitted to exercise the awesome and coercive power of the government.""The Due Process Clause, wrote Brown, ""puts Congress to a choice: its chartered entities may either compete, as market participants, or regulate, as official bodies.""The obvious way to avoid such dangerous jumbles of public and private responsibilities is to never have such government-chartered entities as Amtrak (and Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and others). ""Indeed,"" Brown warns, ""government's increasing reliance on public-private partnerships portends an even more ill-fitting accommodation between the exercise of regulatory power and concerns about fairness and accountability.""This reliance is another unpleasant feature of America's predictable future. For almost eight years, Barack Obama has had the courage of Woodrow Wilson's anti-constitutional conviction that the separation of powers is an anachronistic inconvenience. It supposedly denies Americans the blessings of what Professor Woodrow Wilson of Bryn Mawr College called administrators with ""large powers and unhampered discretion."" It will be at least four years before even the possibility of a president who thinks otherwise.There might never be another such president, now that the Republican Party is embracing a candidate for chief executive who embraces Wilson's enthusiasm for unbounded executive power. Now that both parties regard constitutional conservatism as an inconvenient anachronism, Amtrak is a harbinger of future bipartisanship: There will be the steady permeation of ostensibly, but not really, private entities with government's presence, which for a century has been progressives' consistent goal.

208,MAC,"Financial Meltdown: Thanks to the media, many Americans believe that the financial crisis was a result of banking deregulation. A new study delivers a thorough debunking of that idea.A group of respected think tanks -- the Heritage Foundation, the American Enterprise Institute, the Cato Institute and the Mercatus Center -- has issued a 208-page book titled “The Case Against Dodd-Frank: How The ‘Consumer Protection’ Law Endangers Americans.” It’s a devastating indictment of the law.The book crushes the conventional media and liberal political narrative that deregulation was at the heart of the crisis. Based on that faulty notion, the 2007-2008 financial crisis was greeted with a chorus of big government types calling for more regulation. They got it, in the form of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.Dodd-Frank, writes Mollie McNeill, a Heritage Foundation researcher, “polices everything from derivatives markets to payday lending, and it has (so far) burdened the U.S. economy with thousands of pages of rules.”Those rules aren’t free. Dodd-Frank’s restrictions are now costing the economy hundreds of billions of dollars in lost potential output, jobs and profits.Yet, “Dodd-Frank was enacted by Congress without any significant effort to understand what actually caused the financial crisis,” writes Peter Wallison of AEI, who served as a member of the federal government’s official investigation into the financial mess.Wallison shows with convincing detail that, in his words, the crisis “was principally the result of the U.S. government’s housing policies.” Not deregulation.To fix the damage, the study suggests three reforms:In large part due to Dodd-Frank, the U.S. economy has fallen from 3% growth before Obama, to a pathetic 2% growth now. The first step to restoring our lost economic mojo is to kill Dodd-Frank once and for all.

210,MAC,"Apple’s (AAPL) fiscal second-quarter earnings report was a real downer. Every major metric was down for the former growth company, including revenue, earnings, gross margin, iPhone sales, iPad sales and Mac sales.Also down is Apple stock, which tumbled as much as 8.3% Wednesday after the company’s unsettling Q2 report late Tuesday. Apple stock fell 6.3% to 97.82 the stock market today. Shares dived through their 50-day moving average price line, a key support level.IBD's Take: How healthy is Apple stock? Find out at IBD Stock CheckupApple earned $1.90 a share, down 18% year over year, on sales of $50.56 billion, down 13%, in its fiscal Q2 ended March 26. Analysts on average expected Apple to earn $2 a share on sales of $51.97 billion.For the current Q3, Apple is targeting sales of $42 billion, well below Wall Street’s forecast of $47.32 billion. In Q3 2015, Apple reported revenue of $49.6 billion.Apple’s gross profit margin dipped to 39.4% in Q2 vs. 40.8% a year earlier. Apple expects its gross margin to decline again this quarter, to 37.5%-38%.At least 12 financial analysts cut their price targets on Apple stock following the earnings news. One analyst, Oppenheimer’s Andrew Uerkwitz, lowered his rating on Apple stock to perform from outperform.Here are five key takeaways from Apple's fiscal Q2 report:Apple topped estimates for iPhone sales in the March quarter, but still saw its first-ever year-over-year decline in units. It sold 51.19 million iPhones in fiscal Q2, down 16%. Wall Street was looking for Apple to sell about 50 million iPhones.But Apple signaled a similar percentage decline in iPhone sales for the June quarter. The company plans to lower iPhone sales channel inventory by $2 billion, or about 3 million units, in fiscal Q3.Apple’s Q3 guidance implies iPhone sales of about 38 million units vs. consensus estimates for 44.1 million, Canaccord Genuity analyst Michael Walkley said. In Q3 2015, Apple sold 47.5 million iPhones.“We believe overall weaker-than-expected iPhone demand, continued U.S. dollar strength and customers waiting to upgrade to iPhone 7 contributed to the weak guidance,” Walkley said in a research report.Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi said the iPhone guidance is “sobering,” given that Apple just launched a lower-cost smartphone, the iPhone SE, which the company says is seeing “very strong” demand.The iPhone SE, which starts at $399, could be cannibalizing sales of Apple’s premium smartphones, namely the flagship iPhone 6S series. The SE features top-of-the-line components, but a smaller, 4-inch display.Oppenheimer’s Uerkwitz says iPhone sales will remain weak until the launch of the rumored iPhone 8 in late 2017. He says the upcoming iPhone 7 won’t offer enough compelling features to spur upgrades. The iPhone 8 is likely to feature an OLED display, new camera designs and support for mobile virtual reality headsets.Apple CEO Tim Cook said iPhone sales remain “healthy and strong.” Apple’s iPhone business accounted for 65% of the company’s total revenue in Q2.Apple continues to see a high level of people switching from Android smartphones, he said on the firm's earnings conference call with analysts. He added that Apple is attracting many first-time smartphone buyers and people upgrading from older iPhones.Lower iPhone sales are the result of macroeconomic issues and difficult comparisons to the “extraordinary” iPhone 6 cycle, which met a pent-up demand for larger-screen iPhones, Cook said.Apple sees big opportunities for iPhone sales in India, Cook said. But the populous country has lagged in its deployment of faster wireless networks, namely LTE. India’s LTE rollout began in earnest only this year.“We’ll begin to see some really good networks coming on in India,” Cook said. “That will unleash the power and capability of the iPhone in a way that an older network, a 2.5G or even some 3G networks, would not do.”Another hurdle that Apple faces in India is retail distribution. In India, mobile phones are sold in many small shops, not through wireless carriers like in the U.S.“I view India as where China was maybe seven to 10 years ago,” Cook said. “I think there’s a really great opportunity there.”IPhone sales in India grew 56% in Q2.Meanwhile, iPhone sales in China stalled last quarter. Apple’s total revenue from Greater China, including Taiwan and Hong Kong, tumbled 26% to $12.49 billion in Q2.Apple’s service unit, which includes the App Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay and iCloud, saw sales rise 20% to $5.99 billion in Q2. It is now the company’s second-largest business segment after the iPhone, topping the declining iPad and Mac businesses.Apple’s App Store revenue was up 35% to an all-time record. Apple Music grew to over 13 million paying subscribers.“We feel really great about the early success of Apple’s first subscription business, and our music revenue (including iTunes) has now hit an inflection point after many quarters of decline,” Cook said.Services represented 12% of Apple’s total revenue last quarter. Apple’s services have much higher margins than the company average, Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster said in a report, ""likely 60% or higher at the gross level and in the high-40% range moving to 50% at the operating level.”The main function of Apple’s services, however, is to drive hardware sales, UBS analyst Steven Milunovich pointed out in a report.“Services’ main function is to create the ecosystem that allows Apple to charge premium hardware prices,” Milunovich said.Profit margins are “the Achilles' heel” of Apple stock, BTIG analyst Walter Piecyk said in a report.The maturing smartphone market and the launch of the lower-margin iPhone SE could pressure already declining gross margins.“Bulls would argue that nothing in the consumer electronics history has been like the iPhone and that margin will sustain,” he said. “If investors start doubting that, it could be an incremental problem for the stock.”At the midpoint of its guidance, Apple expects its gross margin to decline to 37.8% in the current quarter, from 39.7% in the year-earlier period.Apple is investing heavily in research and development for future products.The company’s R&D spending is likely to rise 21% to $10.3 billion in calendar 2016, Piper Jaffray’s Munster said.“We believe Apple is experimenting with a car (Project Titan) as well with virtual and mixed reality,” Munster said. “While we believe VR/MR is the future of screens, it will likely be directly cannibalistic to iPhone. Therefore, the best candidate to significantly move the needle from where we are today over the next decade is the car, but we note that neither project is likely to change the question about long-term growth over the next few quarters.”With Apple posting its first year-over-year decline in sales since 2003 in Q2, the pressure is on Cook to find a new sales driver, FBN Securities analyst Shebly Seyrafi said in a note.“We are concerned that, over four years since assuming the CEO position in late 2011, CEO Tim Cook has not delivered any real transformative products,” Seyrafi said. The Apple Watch, introduced a year ago, isn’t inspiring much confidence, he said.“There is speculation about Apple working on a car due in the fiscal 2019-2020 time frame and on Apple developing a virtual reality product, but the car entry would be years away and it would not at all be clear if Apple would succeed here (especially considering Tesla’s (TSLA) recent success with its Model 3),” Seyrafi said.

211,MAC,"The oldest operating McDonald's (MCD), in Downey, Calif., doesn't look like other McDonald's locations across the country. The building is the size of a studio apartment, with horizontal red and white stripes. Towering over the parking lot is a sign that says ""Hamburgers,"" atop which stands Speedee, the hamburger-faced predecessor to Ronald McDonald. A museum contains a shake machine, paper cups and other fast-food artifacts.Just last year, the global icon, once one of the market's most tireless growth stocks, appeared to be on the brink of becoming a museum relic itself. Fast-casual darlings like Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) and Shake Shack (SHAK) threatened to render the giant obsolete. But McDonald's has since shown a nimbleness under CEO Steve Easterbrook, who took over in March 2015 and revived sales starting last fall.McDonald's now is approaching some tough year-over-year comparisons, and parts of the industry are reporting weakness during the second quarter. But a follow-up act is in the works that could set the stock on another run, as the 61-year-old company tries to reimagine what a fast-food burger can be without alienating its core customers.""The one good thing about a restaurant is that people have to eat every day, and everybody loves a good burger,"" said Tigress analyst Ivan Feinseth.
"
212,MAC,"Visiting the Downey McDonald's, which opened in the 1950s, you get the sense that you're about to taste in purer form whatever it was that made a nation — and the world — fall in love with fast food.But bite into a hamburger there, and it tastes like any other hamburger from any other McDonald's being nipped at by ""better-burger"" rivals like Shake Shack, Five Guys and In-N-Out.""The meat's fresh, their fries are not Frankenfoods,"" Feinseth said of a trip to In-N-Out. ""They take the potato, they just julienne it and put it in the fryer. It's fresh, it's delicious, and that, by the way, was what McDonald's was.""That quality helped McDonald's, which came public in 1965, become one of the U.S. stock market's all-time success stories. From its low in the 1973-74 bear market, the stock has soared 23,000%, while blue chip stalwarts like GE (GE) and IBM (IBM) are up 5,000% and 1,600%, respectively. Put another way, $10,000 invested in McDonald's then would be worth $2.31 million now.Recent years, however, have seen a backlash against fast food and changes in eating habits toward fresher ingredients. Many young diners dismissed McDonald's food as poison. The Golden Arches appeared in need of change. But change into what? And from what? Over the past 10 years, what it was had become unclear.Indeed, the company inadvertently nurtured Chipotle into a leader of a fast-casual movement that threatened to kill it.In 2006, McDonald's sold off its ownership of the burrito chain, after having taken a minority stake in 1998. The burger chain said the decision would allow Chipotle to focus on Chipotle, while McDonald's could exact a ""singular focus on brand McDonald's.""Since then, fresh offerings from better-burger rivals lured away customers. Some of McDonald's attempts to go slightly higher-end weren't landing. Demand to be all things to all people, some analysts say, cluttered the menu. And franchisees, already contending with calls to pay employees more, were reluctant to get behind the value offerings the company built much of its reputation on.""For a number of years, (McDonald's) didn't have anything to really say,"" SunTrust Robinson analyst Jake Bartlett told IBD.From mid-2013 to mid-2015, U.S. same-store sales fell or were flat, and the stock meandered through a listless, sideways pattern.Before Steve Easterbrook took over last March, he helped engineer a turnaround in Europe. He became the new CEO of McDonald's U.K. in 2006. Shortly after, he went on BBC's Newsnight to debate Eric Schlosser, author of the 2001 book ""Fast Food Nation,"" among the harshest indictments ever of the fast-food industry.Easterbrook also reduced salt levels in products and introduced more visible nutrition labels, as well as fair-trade, sustainably produced coffee. A McDonald's public-relations campaign called ""Make Up Your Own Mind"" sought to address questions about how the chain's food was made.U.K. division sales improved, and Easterbrook's efforts would serve as a blueprint for the company's turnaround.""That U.K. example is one that I point to, to kind of show that perceptions can change,"" Bartlett said.Since Easterbrook became McDonald's CEO, the company said it would begin using chickens that weren't raised with antibiotics used in human medicine and start working toward sourcing all its eggs for U.S. and Canadian restaurants from cage-free chickens.The company brought back butter and the English muffin to the Egg McMuffin. It showed it was listening and willing to try new things by introducing items such as the Artisan Grilled Chicken sandwich and Buttermilk Crispy Chicken Sandwich. It experimented with digital orders and customization.""I think to some degree, the corporate culture in the past was like, 'Let's perfect everything before we roll it out,' "" Nomura analyst Mark Kalinowski said. ""I think part of the cultural change that Steve is bringing is, 'Look, it doesn't have to be perfect for us to roll something out.' ""Those smaller rollouts, announced over 2015, helped pave the way for the biggest one of the year: All Day Breakfast.The October launch of All Day Breakfast, which many say is at the heart of McDonald's recent sales and earnings rebound, was easy for a number of reasons. The marketing, for one, was in the title. And unlike burgers, many breakfast items don't require raising and tending to a cow, so they cost less. Those items were also already on the menu and didn't need the testing required of new products.Making only some breakfast items available all day made the service less difficult to deliver during non-breakfast hours by easing demands on grill space. The service also managed to unlock sales from people who decided that maybe they wanted some breakfast with their lunch or dinner.""People look at one of those Egg McMuffins like a snack item,"" Feinseth said. He later added: ""You get a Quarter Pounder and you add the McMuffin.""Sales strengthened. In Q3 2015, U.S. comps grew 0.9%, followed by a 5.7% gain in Q4 and a 5.4% increase in Q1 2016. Earnings have rebounded to double-digit growth and look to stay there for the next few years after retreating in five out of the last six quarters.Still, total revenue has been falling since mid-2014, as the strong dollar has weighed on overseas results. Future quarters should see a tougher currency headwind.The stronger dollar has weighed on McDonald's international prospects in recent months, making it an underperformer vs. the S&P 500. Shares are down 8% from an all-time intraday high of 131.96 reached May 10. They finished Friday trading up fractionally to 121.31.Nevertheless, the stock is up 25% from a year ago. That easily outpaces Burger King parent Restaurant Brands International's (QSR) 4% uptick as well as declines of 34% at Shake Shack, 4% at Jack In The Box (JACK) and 10% at Wendy's (WEN).That's not to say the breakfast move was painless. ""The kitchen is impossible with All Day Breakfast,"" a franchisee said in a Nomura survey. ""It is killing our people.""But McDonald's didn't retreat. Despite the added complexity all-day breakfast requires, the customers wanted it, and on Wednesday McDonald's announced it will add more breakfast items to the all-day menu.As McDonald's looks to maintain its momentum, the company faces a delicate balancing act: How aggressively should it aim higher, toward better ingredients, without alienating millions of loyal customers who show up for the cheap food? Adding to the dilemma are higher wages, which also push prices higher.To appeal to cost-conscious diners squeezed by an anemic economic expansion that barely added to Americans' pay, value offerings have proliferated. McDonald's had tried out a Dollar Menu, causing an uproar from franchisees while doing little to improve its fast-food image. Then it started the McPick earlier this year, offering two items for $2. Franchisees called that version of the offer an ""absolute disaster"" and ""a suicide mission,"" according to Nomura's survey.But the company's recent decision to bump up the McPick to two items for $5 has worked better, and more gains could be ahead if diners become accustomed to paying the higher price.""At the very least, it teaches consumers McDonald's is not the Dollar-Menu company,"" Kalinowski said. ""I think that's healthy for the McDonald's system in terms of people (not just viewing) McDonald's as cheap food and that's it.""Along those lines, the company in May said it was testing fresh, never-frozen hamburger patties in 14 locations in the Dallas area. It has also tested garlic fries, bratwurst, new Big Macs, breakfast bowls and a Sriracha sauce.But systemwide changes could be slow to come. And a bigger rollout of a fresher hamburger could pressure McDonald's margins and upend preparations behind the counter.SunTrust's Bartlett sees the way forward involving a nationwide marketing effort behind the McPick, noting that higher-end chains like Shake Shack are already known for being more expensive and have leeway to charge more.""You have to be a lot of things to a lot of people. One of the things is you have to have that value consumer; you have to offer a good solution to them,"" he said. ""So this idea of just improving the quality of the food so that you can just charge more, and sales go up, and everyone's happy — some people just don't want to pay more.""But an RBC Capital Markets survey released in May suggested that if McDonald's uses better-quality ingredients, customers are likely to pay more.Perceptions of affordability seemed ""to be more of a function of 'what you get' than 'what you pay,' "" indicating that diners ""will be willing to pay up for what they perceive to be the 'good stuff,' "" RBC said.And despite McDonald's affordable value deals, customers gave it only a middling score on affordability.Meanwhile, Kalinowski singled out McDonald's fresh hamburger test, saying in a research note that it ""has the potential to be a big, big deal,"" as it would give customers better-tasting food cooked more quickly, meaning faster service and more customers cycling through the restaurant.Morningstar analyst R.J. Hottovy thinks the key to continuing growth is to still have value offerings but to focus on better ingredients.""It helps to widen your audience, it can help change misconceptions about the brand, and I think it speaks to the audience that you're looking for — the younger generation that may have turned its back on McDonald's,"" he said.

213,MAC,"Apple (AAPL) late Tuesday said its iPhone unit sales fell for the second consecutive quarter on a year-over-year basis. But the 15% drop in the June quarter was less than many had feared.Apple sold 40.4 million iPhones in its fiscal third quarter ended June 25. That's better than Wall Street's projection for 40 million units.Apple stock was up nearly 7% in after-hours trading on the stock market today following the earnings news release.During the regular session Tuesday, Apple fell 0.7% to 96.63. It closed below its 50-day moving average line for the first time since July 6.IBD'S TAKE: Apple stock has an IBD Relative Strength Rating of 16, meaning it's been outperformed by 84% of other companies on the stock market over the past 12 months. For more information on Apple, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.Apple earned $1.42 a share, down 23%, on sales of $42.4 billion, down 15%, in its fiscal Q3. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected Apple to earn $1.38 a share on sales of $42.09 billion.For the current quarter, Apple guided to sales of $45.5 billion and $47.5 billion, or $46.5 billion at the midpoint. It did not provide an EPS target. Wall Street has been modeling Apple to earn $1.60 a share on sales of $45.71 billion.Apple's gross profit margin was 38% in Q3, compared with 39.7% in the year-ago quarter. It guided to a gross margin in the September quarter of 37.5% to 38%.""We are pleased to report third-quarter results that reflect stronger customer demand and business performance than we anticipated at the start of the quarter,"" Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a statement. ""We had a very successful launch of iPhone SE and we're thrilled by customers' and developers' response to software and services we previewed at WWDC (Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference) in June.""Cook boasted that Apple's services business grew 19% year over year.Revenue from iPhone sales dipped by 23% year over year to $24.05 billion as more customers gravitated to the company's new lower-cost iPhone SE.Apple sold 9.95 million iPads in Q3, down 9% in units year over year. But revenue increased 7% to $4.88 billion thanks to the addition of the higher-priced iPad Pro in the tablet family.Mac computer sales fell 11% by units and 13% by revenue in Q3. Apple sold 4.25 million Macs, generating $5.24 billion in the June quarter.Apple's ""Other Products"" category saw revenue fall 16% to $2.22 billion.

214,MAC,"Purchases of new U.S. single-family homes rose in June to the highest level in more than eight years, indicating a firm and resilient housing market.Sales increased 3.5% to a 592,000 annualized pace, the fastest since February 2008, Commerce Department data showed Tuesday in Washington. Figures for May were revised higher. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey called for a 560,000 rate.While the government's new-home purchase data are subject to big swings from month to month, the broader picture for residential real estate shows steady gains fueled by stable employment and low borrowing costs. Faster wage growth and construction of properties priced for entry-level buyers have the potential of further stoking the market.""The grinding recovery continues,"" said Brett Ryan, a U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. in New York. ""The fundamental underpinnings are still really supportive for housing, so it should be a steady contributor to growth over the next year or so.""Estimates in the Bloomberg survey of economists ranged from 525,000 to 575,000. The Commerce Department revised the May reading to a 572,000 pace from a previously estimated 551,000.IBD'S TAKE: With housing demand picking up, some homebuilders and building products firms have been reporting strong earnings and breaking out to new highs. Check out the IBD 50 list of the very best performing stocks to find several housing-related names. The pickup in demand last month was led by a 10.9%  increase in the West. In the Midwest, sales jumped 10.4% to an 85,000 annualized rate, the strongest since November 2007. Purchases eased in the South and Northeast.The gain in sales pushed down the supply of homes to 4.9 months, the lowest since February of last year, from 5.1 months in May. There were 244,000 new houses on the market at the end of June, compared with 241,000 in the prior two months.The median sales price of a new house advanced 6.1% from June 2015 to $306,700. The gain reflected more purchases of homes valued between $400,000 and $500,000. Eighteen percent of the homes sold in June, the biggest share since September, were in that price range.Another report on Tuesday showed home prices in 20 U.S. cities rose less than projected in May. The S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller gauge of values climbed 5.2% in the 12 months through May, less than the 5.4% year-over-year advance in April.New-home sales, which account for about 10% of the residential market, are tabulated when contracts are signed. That makes them a timelier barometer than transactions on existing homes.Previously owned home purchases unexpectedly climbed in June to the strongest level in more than nine years, helped by first-time buyers who made up their greatest share of sales since July 2012, National Association of Realtors data showed last week. Closings advanced 1.1% to a 5.57 million annual rate.The residential real estate market is being supported by gradually increasing wage growth, steady job gains, and mortgage rates near historical lows, while limited inventory is hampering affordability by boosting asking prices.The average rate on a 30-year, fixed mortgage was 3.45% in the week ended July 21, close to the record-low 3.31% reached in 2012, according to Freddie Mac figures dating to 1971.

215,MAC,"Gigantic government's complexity and opacity provide innumerable opportunities for opportunists to act unconstrained by clear law or effective supervision. Today's example, involving the government's expropriation of hundreds of billions of dollars, features three sets of unsympathetic actors -- a grasping federal government, a few hedge funds nimble at exploiting the co-mingling of government and the private sector, and two anomalous institutions that should never have existed.The two are the ""government-sponsored enterprises"" (GSEs) Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. This maddeningly complex story illustrates the toll the administrative state takes on the rule of law.The two federally chartered but privately owned GSEs, which guarantee 80% of American mortgages, were created because Washington wanted to engineer -- what could go wrong? -- more homeownership than market forces would produce. What could go wrong did, and in 2008 the two GSEs floundered. In September 2008, the government rescued them with $187.5 billion and placed them in conservatorship, which is supposed to be temporary and rehabilitative. A conserved entity should be returned to normal business in private ownership.Fannie and Freddie have recuperated profitably. They also have been nationalized.The government's original rescue terms were for Fannie and Freddie to pay a stiff dividend on the bailout funds -- 10%, amounting to $4.7 billion per quarter. Then, however, the Treasury Department was told of the GSEs' strong recoveries. According to documents recently unsealed, on Aug. 9, 2012, Treasury was told that the GSEs' prospects were for strong profitability, requiring no further government assistance. Eight days later, Treasury negotiated with the GSEs' conservator, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), for an astounding revision (called ""the third amendment"") of policy: Instead of the agreed-upon dividend, and already enjoying a right to 80% of the GSEs' profits, the government would get 100% forever, far exceeding the size of the original bailout.So, the government (Treasury) negotiated with itself (FHFA) to achieve a windfall for itself. And the conservator abandoned its duty to safeguard the assets of the entities in conservatorship.The government claims it changed the terms in order to avoid any need to give the GSEs additional funds to pay the 10% dividend on funds already received. This claim, however, is not credible, given what and when the government knew about the GSEs' profitability.After the government ""negotiated"" with itself for the GSEs' profits, the value of their shares cratered. Some hedge funds bet that the government's transformation of the GSEs into a revenue stream for itself would not survive judicial scrutiny. They added to the GSEs' shares they had bought before the ""third amendment"" when they mistakenly trusted the government to act properly as a conservator. They purchased additional shares for pennies on the dollar.Legal scrutiny has arrived in the form of lawsuits with enormous stakes. One hedge fund stands to make $7.5 billion if the government is found to have unconstitutionally taken private property without compensation.A federal judge has sided with the federal government. (See a pattern here?) He made the ""utterly astounding"" (New York University law professor Richard Epstein's characterization) judgment -- ""without allowing any discovery about the underlying facts"" (Epstein) -- that a fiduciary (FHFA) can take private assets of the fiduciary's supposed beneficiaries and transfer them to the government. Epstein expects a higher court ""to decide that government conservators, like private conservators, cannot loot the corporations whose shareholders they are sworn to protect.""Many individuals and community banks invested in Fannie and Freddie in good faith and have been injured by the government's profit confiscation. Granted, a few wealthy people would become more so from judicial invalidation of the ""third amendment."" This, however, is at most an argument against creating the moral hazard inherent in GSEs. It is not an argument for allowing the anomalous nature of these institutions to justify lawless discretion by a government as self-interested as those who would profit from restraining the government with law.After the Revolutionary War, many state debts were bought by speculators at steep discounts from the original purchasers, who feared that the states would not pay face value. The buyers, however, wagered correctly that the federal government would assume the debts and pay at par in order to establish the nation's creditworthiness. Alexander Hamilton successfully argued for assumption. Thomas Jefferson and his allies reluctantly acquiesced in exchange for a more southern location for the nation's new capital.Which is why Washington is where it is. Fannie's and Freddie's misadventures illustrate why Washington is what it is.

216,MAC,"Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 stealth fighter will face off against the older A-10 in a series of tests this year, the Pentagon's chief weapons tester said Tuesday amid doubts about the new aircraft's ability to perform close air support as effectively as the Cold War-era bruiser.The two planes will be tested against each other in close air support, search and rescue, and forward air controller missions. The testing office had said previously the match-up would happen in 2018.“We’re going to do it under all the circumstances that we see CAS [close air support] conducted, including under high-threat conditions in which we expect F-35 will have an advantage, and other conditions requiring loitering on the target, low-altitude operations and so forth,” said Michael Gilmore, director of operational test and evaluation at the Pentagon, at a Senate hearing Tuesday, according to Stars and Stripes.Lockheed shares closed up 0.6% in the stock market today.The Air Force had been looking to retire the A-10 line to save money, but supporters in the military and in Congress have sought to keep it in service longer, saying the F-35 isn't as heavily armored, has less payload capacity and can't orbit above battlefields for as long as the venerated ""Warthog"" can.House Armed Services Committee Chairman Rep. Mac Thornberry proposed changes to the defense bill that would prevent the Air Force from retiring the A-10 until the tests between the two planes are compete, according to Defense News.But service officials maintain that the aircraft shouldn't be compared on a one-for-one basis, noting that the F-35's stealth would also allow it to operate in more areas.Last year, Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Mark Welsh said any tests between the two planes would be a “silly exercise,"" and F-35 program manager Lt. Gen. Christopher Bogdan said the Air Force needs to test what it “intends the F-35 to do — not the mission that the Air Force intends the F-35 to do looking like the A-10.”
"
217,MAC,"A federal judge this week slapped down another effort by the Obama administration to conceal its use of taxpayer funds. Litigation between shareholders in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the U.S. government has called for the revelation of documents that the White House tried to keep secret under the doctrine of “executive privilege.”Plaintiffs contend that the federal takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 2008, and the diversion of profits from the companies to the federal treasury in 2012, carried out an unconstitutional taking of property. The Obama administration has refused to make public communications -- thousands of documents -- between the Treasury Department, Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and the White House, on the ground of executive privilege.U.S. Court of Federal Claims Judge Margaret Sweeney rejected government efforts to protect an even narrower set of communications as “protected.”  “The court will not condone the misuse of a protective order as a shield to insulate public officials from criticism in the way they execute their public duties,” she wrote. This should be the operating principle applied to a trove of documents still sealed under varying assertions of “executive privilege.”In an effort to demonstrate the need for transparency, Judge Sweeney formally published her order so that it and the related documents can be readily found by every law firm in the country and easily cited as a precedent for the proposition that the federal government cannot hide behind protective orders to keep documents sealed in order to avoid “second guessing” of unpopular or poorly thought out decisions.In the landmark U.S. Supreme Court case on President Richard Nixon’s effort to keep the Watergate tapes secret, the court acknowledged, “Without this privilege, the president will not enjoy the candor necessary to make the best decisions possible.” However, this did not create a blanket privilege of confidentiality for every communication within the executive branch.  The Nixon case certainly would not recognize a right to secrecy in the case between Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac shareholders and the Obama administration.For starters, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac themselves are not strictly parts of the executive branch of government; they are publicly-traded corporations that operate under government charters. In addition, the FHFA, as the companies’ designated conservator, is not an agency that reports directly to the president, even though the head of that agency is a presidential appointment. Executive privilege encompasses discussions between the president and his closest aides. No court has ever held that would cover an independent agency. The president cannot direct independent agency heads or fire them; they could not fall within Nixon’s description of “those who assist him.”Even if executive privilege were held to possibly include independent agencies, a generalized right to confidentiality does not apply throughout the entire executive branch. If it extended that far, then presumably every employee in the executive branch, every government-owned corporation (including Amtrak and the U.S. Postal Service), and every communication between these individuals would receive the same protected status as conversations between the president and the White House chief of staff. This would create a level of secrecy that flies in the face of transparency in a democracy and has no basis in the text of the Constitution.Moreover, the subject matter in the case involving Fannie and Freddie falls outside the balancing test set out in the Nixon case. In that case, the court recognized that military or diplomatic secrets might be entitled to the highest level of protection, one that might verge on absolute. The communications in the documents unveiled this week reveal discussions about the projected earnings of Fannie and Freddie from six years ago.  Nothing about national security or foreign affairs is in these communications and therefore the broadest protection for executive privilege doesn’t apply here.It is true that in the Nixon case, the court found that communications outside these areas would have to seek privilege based on “the president’s generalized interest in confidentiality.” But in such cases, the court said the interest in confidentiality must be balanced against the competing need of other branches for disclosure of the information. In the Nixon case, the claim of confidentiality gave way before the right of criminal defendants to produce the information necessary for a fair criminal trial. The Bill of Rights, which required the production of relevant evidence to the defense, outweighed a diffuse claim of confidentiality.Ultimately, executive privilege must be balanced against the Bill of Rights. In the Nixon case, the court found that any presidential claim to confidentiality had to give way before the Fifth Amendment right to due process and the Sixth Amendment right to compulsory process. In the case involving Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the plaintiffs are suing directly under the Fifth Amendment Takings Clause. The federal courts have a specific constitutional duty to vindicate those rights, which should take precedence in any balancing test over the president’s generalized claim to confidentiality.In the Nixon case, the court articulated narrow circumstances for the use of executive privilege. The communications in the depositions unveiled this week involve discussions about now-outdated revenue estimates from independent corporations, not national security. They reveal what was said by officials, some of whom were employed by independent agencies. These discussions were well outside the inner circle of aides who serve the president directly and on whose candor presidents must rely.Judge Sweeney has raised a high bar to clear for justifying a designation of protected information. This makes it even more implausible that any of the thousands of documents still sealed in the litigation involving Fannie and Freddie will come close to meeting the standard for executive privilege that the court set in the Nixon case.Yoo is Heller Professor of Law at the UC Berkeley School of Law and a visiting scholar at the American Enterprise Institute.Cooper is a Senior Fellow with the National Center for Public Policy Research.

218,MAC,"Apple (AAPL) late Tuesday reported its first-ever year-over-year decline in iPhone sales and its first quarterly revenue drop since 2003.To soften the blow, Apple increased its dividend and share buyback plan. CEO Tim Cook also said business was ""healthy"" and that Apple has an ""amazing"" product pipeline.But the stock still fell nearly 8% in after-hours trading following the earnings release. During the regular trading session Tuesday, Apple stock fell 0.7% to 104.35, closing just above its 50-day moving average. Key iPhone chip suppliers Broadcom (AVGO), NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) also fell after hours.For its fiscal second quarter ended March 26, Apple earned $1.90 a share on sales of $50.6 billion, both missing views. On a year-over-year basis, earnings per share fell 18.5% while sales dropped 13%.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected Apple to earn $2 a share on sales of $51.97 billion in the March quarter.Apple topped estimates for iPhone sales in the quarter, but still saw a sharp drop. It sold 51.19 million iPhones in fiscal Q2, down 16% from a year earlier. Financial analysts on average were looking for Apple to sell about 50 million iPhones during the March quarter.Greater China sales, including Taiwan and Hong Kong, tumbled 26% to $12.49 billion, after soaring 71% in the year-earlier quarter.For the current Q3, Apple is targeting overall revenue of $42 billion, based on the midpoint of guidance, which is well below estimates. It did not give an EPS target.Wall Street was modeling for Apple to earn $1.76 a share, down 5%, on sales of $47.32 billion, also down 5%, in the June quarter.Apple said its board authorized an increase of $50 billion to the company’s program to return capital to shareholders. Under the expanded program, Apple plans to spend a cumulative total of $250 billion of cash by the end of March 2018.As part of the updated program, the share repurchase authorization was raised to $175 billion from the $140 billion level announced last year.Apple also increased its quarterly dividend by 10% to 57 cents a share.Apple has signaled a hiring slowdown by cutting all of its contract recruiters in recent weeks, VentureBeat reported Monday. It also is laying off some full-time recruiters as well, the news website said. In all, more than 100 people were impacted by the moves.Apple’s gross profit margin dipped to 39.4% in Q2 vs. 40.8% a year earlier. Apple expects its gross margin to decline again in the current quarter, to 37.5%-38%.CEO Tim Cook described Q2 as a ""challenging quarter.""“Despite the pause in our growth, our results reflect excellent execution by our team in the face of ongoing macroeconomic headwinds in much of the world and difficult year-over-year comparisons,” Cook said on a conference call with analysts.Apple faced currency weakness in most of its international markets. In constant currency, Apple’s revenue declined by 9% year over year, Cook said.Despite the decline in iPhone sales, Apple’s smartphone business remains “healthy and strong,” Cook said. Apple continues to see a high level of people switching from Android smartphones and other platforms, he said.Apple’s iPhone business accounted for 65% of the company’s total revenue in Q2.Apple also saw declines in its iPad and Mac computer businesses. Sales of iPads declined 19% in units and revenue in Q2. Mac sales fell 12% in units and 9% in revenue in the March quarter.Cook hinted at exciting products ahead. Analysts believe Apple is working on an electric car and an Internet TV service, among other things.“The future of Apple is very bright,” Cook said. “Our product pipeline has amazing innovations in store. … We are forging ahead with important investments in research and development, in our infrastructure and our supply chain. We’ve made 15 acquisitions in the last four quarters to accelerate our product and services road map and we’re always on the lookout for companies with great technology, talent and strategic fit.”

219,MAC,"It was very appropriate that on Friday, the day after the massacre of five Dallas police officers, the New York Times devoted nearly the whole top half of its front page to four enormous photos of the death of Philando Castile, a black motorist killed by a Minnesota police officer.Of course, the paper was printed before the Dallas murders; and even the New York Times might not have so prominently featured the Minnesota killing on its front page had the Dallas murders occurred a few hours earlier.Nevertheless, it was completely appropriate. The New York Times has been in the forefront of the left's hysterical, hate-filled attacks on police officers and whites.Also appropriately, on the day of the Dallas murders, the Times published two white-hating, police-hating pieces.One was by Michael Eric Dyson, a radical black professor of sociology at Georgetown University.The Dyson column is nothing more than a racist hit piece on ""white America.""An example:""At birth, (whites) are given a pair of binoculars. ... Those binoculars are privilege; they are status, regardless of your class. In fact the greatest privilege that exists is for white folk to get stopped by a cop and not end up dead when the encounter is over.""Dyson wrote these words based on the police killings of two blacks last week, about which he knows nothing except the narrative of the (left-wing) media and what he has seen on some grainy phone videos.And not once does Professor Dyson mention that the Minnesota police officer was Latino. Why would he? That would suggest that Latinos, too, are given racist binoculars at birth. But Dyson would never say so, because it is white America he loathes.Nor does he note, or perhaps even know -- because of his left-wing binoculars -- facts such as these:In 2015, of the 990 people shot dead by police, 93 were unarmed and 38 of them were black. Of the 505 people shot dead by police thus far in 2016, 37 were unarmed and of them 13 were black. Given that blacks murder and rob more than whites -- they committed 62% of robberies, 57% of murders and 45% of assaults in the 75 biggest counties in the country in 2009 (despite comprising about 15% of the population in these counties) -- an unarmed black is less likely to be killed by police than an unarmed white. (Data from the Washington Post.)Does Dyson, a professor of sociology, not know these statistics? Does he not know that, statistically, whites have more reason to fear being murdered by a black than vice versa? If he doesn't, he shouldn't be teaching sociology. If he does, students should be aware that he is a left-wing, black nationalist propagandist, not a teacher.The same day the Times published Dyson's piece, it published a second anti-white, anti-cop, hate-America piece by the mother of Michael Brown, the young black man killed in Ferguson, Mo. That black grand jurors and even Obama's Department of Justice found the policeman who killed Brown was acting in self-defense after being attacked and thus justified him in doing so means nothing to the New York Times. So it published the grieving mother's anti-cop hate.The blacks and whites of the left have led much of America, especially black America, to believe that cops are generally racist, that there is ""systemic"" racism and that whites are privileged and racist. It's all a lie that has had -- and will continue to have -- murderous consequences.America has become the least racist multiracial, multiethnic country in world history. This drives the America-hating left crazy. That's why leftists manufacture fantasies like ""microaggressions"" -- nonracist statements that the left labels racist, foolishness like ""white privilege"" and the dangerous rhetoric of ""Blacks Lives Matter.""Just yesterday the New York Times published the results of a study conducted by a black Harvard professor of economics that shows that ""when it comes to the most lethal form of force -- police shootings -- the study finds no racial bias.""""It is the most surprising result of my career,"" said Roland G. Fryer Jr., the author of the study.One assumes that this Harvard professor has never read Heather Mac Donald or any other conservatives who have been writing this for years.The New York Times -- as the flagship publication of the left -- and the rest of the left have the blood of police on their hands. And not just cops' blood -- the blood of the blacks murdered because of police reticence to vigorously patrol black areas. What is known as the ""Ferguson effect"" was created entirely by the left.
"
220,MAC,"There was never a more appropriately named book than ""The War on Cops"" by Heather Mac Donald, published a few weeks ago, on the eve of the greatest escalation of that war by the ambush murders of five policemen in Dallas.Nor is this war against the police confined to Dallas. It is occurring across the country. Who is to blame?There is a ton of blame, more than enough to go around to the wide range of people and institutions that have contributed to these disasters. In addition to the murderers who have killed people they don't even know, there are those who created the atmosphere of blind hatred in which such killers flourish.Chief among those who generate this poisonous atmosphere are career race-hustlers like Al Sharpton and racist institutions like the ""Black Lives Matter"" movement. All such demagogues need is a situation where there has been a confrontation where someone was white and someone else was black. The facts don't matter to them.The same is true of the more upscale, genteel and sophisticated race panderers, including the president of the United States. During his first year in the White House, Barack Obama chastised a white policeman over his handling of an incident with a black professor at Harvard -- after admitting that he didn't know the specific facts.Nor did he know the specifics when he publicly announced that, if he had a son, that son would look like Trayvon Martin. Are we to decide who is right and who is wrong on the basis of skin color? There was a long history of that in the days of the old Jim Crow South. Are we fighting against racism today or do we just want to put it under new management?No one should imagine that any of this is helping the black community. The surge in murder rates across the country, in the wake of the anarchy unleashed after the Ferguson, Mo., and Baltimore riots, has taken a wholly disproportionate number of black lives.But, to the race-hustlers, black lives don't really matter nearly as much as their chance to get publicity, power, money, votes or whatever else serves their own interests.The mainstream media play a large, and largely irresponsible role in the creation and maintenance of a poisonous racial atmosphere that has claimed the lives of policemen around the country.That same poisoned atmosphere has claimed the lives of even more blacks, who have been victims of violence by thugs and criminals who have had fewer restrictions as the police have pulled back, or have been pulled back, under political pressure.The media provide the publicity on which career race-hustlers thrive. It is a symbiotic relationship, in which turmoil in the streets gives the media something exciting to attract viewers. In return, the media give those behind this turmoil millions of dollars' worth of free publicity to spread their poison.It is certainly news when there is turmoil in the streets. But that is very different from saying that giving one-sided presentations at length of the claims of those who promote this turmoil makes sense.The media have also actively promoted the anti-police propaganda by the way they present the news. This goes all the way back to the Rodney King riots of 1992. Television stations all across the country repeatedly played a selectively edited fraction of a videotape covering the encounter between the police and Rodney King, who had been stopped after a wild, high-speed chase.The great majority of that video never saw the light of day on the TV networks that incessantly played the selectively edited fraction.When the police were charged with excessive violence in overcoming Rodney King's resistance to arrest, the jury saw the whole video -- and refused to convict the policemen. That is when people who had seen only what the media showed them rioted after the jury verdict.Today, the media keep repeating the mantra that there was a ""peaceful demonstration,"" even when it ends in violence. How many people have to die in ""peaceful demonstrations"" before the media admit that those who promote mob disruptions have to know what is likely to happen when you put mobs in the streets at night?Mob rule is not democracy. It threatens democracy, as it threatens lives -- black or white -- and all lives should matter.This is the first of two parts.

221,MAC,"Apple's (AAPL) smartwatch is seeing shrinking sales as customers await an overdue product refresh, Cowen analyst Timothy Arcuri said in a research report Sunday.Arcuri slashed his forecast for Apple Watch sales for the next two quarters, citing ""very poor"" demand.For the June quarter, he reduced his sales prediction to 2.4 million units from 3.5 million, ahead of an expected September launch of the Apple Watch 2.For the September quarter, he slashed his Apple Watch sales target to 3.5 million units from 6.5 million.He is looking for 5.5 million Apple Watch units in the December quarter, unchanged from a year earlier.Apple Watch sales are the least of Apple's worries as it faces declining revenue in its core iPhone, iPad and Mac businesses. The Cupertino, Calif.-based company is scheduled to report fiscal-third-quarter earnings results after the market close Tuesday.IBD'S TAKE: Apple stock has an IBD Relative Price Strength Rating of 17, meaning that it has been outperformed by 83% of other companies on the stock market over the past 12 months. For more information on Apple, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.""Amid pervasive investor fear and negativity, we see results/guidance as not great, but good enough to start swinging the tide from near-term fear to cautious optimism about the future,"" Arcuri said. ""Given our installed base work, we see a 'super-cycle' in '17, and iPhone 7 could even sell a little better than bearish expectations. We remain bullish and would use any weakness from these levels to buy.""He reiterated his outperform rating on Apple stock, with a price target of 125.Apple was down 1.5%, near 97, in late-afternoon trading on the stock market today.Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster maintained his overweight rating on Apple stock and price target of 153 in a report Sunday.He noted that Apple Watch estimates are trending down since IDC data last week indicated Apple shipped 1.6 million smartwatches in the June quarter, down 55% from a year earlier.""IDC data suggests that Apple sold 1.6 million Apple Watches in the June quarter vs. our 2 million expectation,"" Munster said. ""It's difficult not to view the Watch as an early flop, although we had expected the product to ramp slowly in the beginning.""The next killer feature for the Apple Watch likely will be untethering from the iPhone, but that might be a feature for the third-generation Apple Watch, given battery constraints and adding a wireless radio, he said.Munster has been modeling for Apple Watch sales of 2 million units in the June quarter, down 20% year over year, and 2.2 million units in the September quarter, down 32%.He expects Apple Watch sales to rebound in the December quarter, with 6 million units, up 27%.Munster reiterated his overweight rating on Apple stock with a price target of 153.

222,MAC,"Financial Crisis: The Republican platform put forward in Cleveland is a lively and conservative document, full of great ideas to make America great again. But one thing stands out as a truly bad idea: reviving the partly-repealed Glass-Steagall Act.""We support reinstating the Glass-Steagall Act, which prohibits commercial banks from engaging in high risk activities,"" says the platform document.What? It was one of the Democrats' big talking points during the 2007-2008 financial crisis and after that a major cause of the panic was due to Bill Clinton in 1999 foolishly going along with the Republicans to get rid of Glass-Steagall, the 1932 law that forbids commercial banks from underwriting or dealing in securities.The only problem is, it isn't true.Glass-Steagall was an anachronism, a legislative dinosaur that kept American banks from competing in the internet age, when global transactions could take place at the push of a button. It actually increased costs to consumers, but didn't really make the banking system safer.And contrary to recent overheated rhetoric, Glass-Steagall wasn't ""repealed."" The only part that was eliminated was one that kept banks from being affiliated with a company that underwrites or sells securities.Repeal of that provision had nothing -- zero -- to do with the financial crisis. It's a myth.We'll let Peter Wallison, who sat on the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission and is perhaps the foremost expert on the 2008 crisis, explain:""The financial crisis,"" wrote Wallison, now a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, ""was the result of financial firms (including the government-backed mortgage companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac), including commercial banks, buying and holding risky mortgages or securities backed by risky mortgages. Underwriting and dealing in securities had nothing to do with the crisis.""As we've noted literally dozens of times before, the financial crisis' origins lay in Bill Clinton's decision in the early 1990s to use Big Government to force banks to make mortgage loans to low-income people who were bad credit risks.The banks did as they were told -- they were threatened, actually -- and then, when trillions in loans predictably went bad, the banks were demonized and scapegoated by the left and their ignorant allies in the media.And that's how Dodd-Frank, the worst financial law in modern history, was born.Some also seem to believe that simply restoring one part of Glass-Steagall will end ""too-big-to-fail"" for banks. Not so. It would merely force banks that now have securities businesses to sell them -- thus making themselves financially smaller, less profitable and arguably much weaker.Let's hope the next Congress forgets this bad idea and focuses instead on doing something that truly would make a big difference: abolishing the Dodd-Frank law, which has hurt businesses and consumers and is arguably the number one factor holding back the U.S. economy right now.
"
223,MAC,"The fascinating thing about Hillary Clinton's lie that ""African-Americans"" are disproportionately killed by police is that she continues peddling it after the murders of three law enforcement officers in Baton Rouge, which followed the ambush killings of five officers in Dallas.In both cases, the murderers were black men apparently convinced that the cops were out to get black people and who, therefore, sought to exact revenge.President Barack Obama, too, talks about the ""disparity"" that blacks, compared to whites, are more likely to be killed by the police. That Obama -- in lecturing about this so-called disparity -- gets away with ignoring the disproportionate rate at which blacks, especially young blacks, commit violent crime is truly astonishing.Should blacks, at 13% of the population, comprise 13%  of doctors, 13 percent of lawyers and 13% of NBA players? If not, does this mean there is a ""disparity"" that we must address as a society?According to economist John Lott, teenage black males, compared to teen white males, are nine times more likely to commit murder -- and the murder victim is almost always another young black man. What about that disparity, Mr. President?It's also interesting to watch the reaction of those who believe Clinton and defend her position, even when they are confronted with the facts. Talk about -- pardon the pun -- shooting the messenger. When I told someone that, according to The Washington Post, of the 965 blacks killed by cops last year, less than 4% involved a white cop and unarmed black man, he sniffed, ""Why should a cop kill anyone  who is unarmed?""Well, take the case for Michael Brown, arguably the white police-black suspect encounter that launched the Black Lives Matter movement and its mantra, ""Hands Up, Don't Shoot."" Eyewitness testimony and physical evidence show that Brown charged the police officer and attempted to get the cop's gun. Unarmed does not mean non-threatening.It's hard to believe that two Ivy League-educated lawyers, Obama and Clinton, do not understand things like statistics, ratios and how to properly interpret crime data to incorporate the rate at which crime is committed by young black men versus the rate at which crime is committed by young white men.As Heather Mac Donald of the Manhattan Institute writes in The Wall Street Journal, ""According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, blacks were charged with 62% of all robberies, 57% of murders and 45% of assaults in the 75 largest U.S. counties in 2009, though they made up roughly 15% of the population there.""This leads us to but one conclusion: Obama and Clinton are flat-out lying. The goal is obvious -- to retain that monolithic black vote, without which Democrats cannot win at the presidential level.Obama cannot brag about -- and Clinton cannot run on -- his economic record for blacks. Under his watch, black poverty is up. Net worth is down. The ""wealth gap"" between blacks and whites is at a 25-year high. And as to the employment of black men, their ""labor force participation rate"" (the percentage of those 20 years of age and over who are either working or looking for work) hit its lowest rate in December 2013 -- well into Obama's second term and his economic ""recovery.""That low was the worst since 1972, when the Bureau of Labor Statistics began keeping such records. And since December 2010, black men's employment rate every single month to date  has seen lower numbers than any month under all other presidents dating back to 1972.So, what to do? Change the subject, of course. Make the election about ""social justice."" Prattle on about what Clinton calls the ""school-to-prison pipeline."" Never mind that this drive to induce paranoia among blacks has real-world consequences.As mentioned, already it has helped inspire murderers to kill officers in Dallas and Baton Rouge. But it also causes police officers to be less proactive, fearing that they, too, will be accused of unfairly ""profiling"" blacks. Cops pull back. This police passivity means crime increases, the victims of which are disproportionately black, the very people Ms. Clinton claims to care so deeply about.Lies get votes. But they also get people killed.
"
224,MAC,"""Events, dear boy, events,"" the late British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan supposedly replied when asked what he most feared. And events can certainly make a difference, as was apparent this week: Prime Minister David Cameron moved out of No. 10 Downing Street and Theresa May moved in. This came after British voters, against Cameron's advice and contrary to widespread expectations, voted to leave the European Union June 23.But the extraordinary machinations in London are not capturing American voters' attentions as much as things happening over here. At the midpoint of a tumultuous and often surprising presidential campaign, with the nominees seemingly chosen (though some Republicans still hope to stop Donald Trump in Cleveland), two major events have roiled the American political landscape over the last week.One was the extraordinary statement delivered by FBI Director James Comey July 5. In excruciating detail he described how Hillary Clinton defied the laws and regulations requiring a secretary of state to use government email and turn it over to the government after leaving office. She was ""extremely careless,"" he concluded.He also showed beyond any possibility of contradiction how she has repeatedly lied about the subject. And then he announced that she will not be prosecuted for her obvious violations of section 793(f) of the federal criminal code.Of course, Comey is not a prosecutor but he was put in the position of one after it was revealed that Attorney General Loretta Lynch had met with Bill Clinton for 30 minutes on her official plane on the tarmac of the Phoenix airport on June 28. How was the meeting arranged? Did they expect it to go unreported, as it almost did?One might be pardoned for thinking that, for once, Donald Trump got it right in a tweet: ""The fix is in.""Comey said ""no reasonable prosecutor"" would bring charges, because Clinton lacked criminal intent. But the statute requires only ""gross negligence,"" which sounds an awful lot like ""extremely careless."" Lynch, after her perfunctory ratification of Comey's decision not to prosecute, didn't even try to explain the difference to a congressional committee.Democrats heaved a sigh of relief. They wouldn't have to find a new nominee. But they can hardly claim that Clinton has been cleared. Polls show a majority of voters think she should have been indicted. And Quinnipiac polls this week showed Donald Trump leading or tying her in Florida, Pennsylvania and Ohio, three states without whose electoral votes Barack Obama would not have been re-elected.Then came the murder in Dallas during a Black Lives Matter protest of five policemen by a man who said he hated white cops. That followed videotapes of shootings of black men by police in Minnesota and Louisiana in circumstances that might well have been unjustifiable.At a funeral service in Dallas July 12 both George W. Bush and Barack Obama delivered excellent speeches -- until Obama went on at greater length to suggest once again that black men are being gunned down by racist police and that this problem could be solved somehow by gun control legislation.This echoes a meme to which Obama has been giving support since the shooting of a black man in Ferguson, Missouri, in August 2014 -- a shooting which his own Justice Department eventually ruled justifiable. The resulting ""Ferguson effect"" -- officers withdrawing from proactive policing -- has been described by the Manhattan Institute's Heather Mac Donald. The phenomenon has resulted in a terrifying spike of homicides in major cities such as Baltimore, St. Louis and Chicago -- and coldblooded murders of police officers in Dallas and elsewhere.The fact, documented by Harvard economist Roland Fryer, is that there is no epidemic of unjustified police killings of blacks. Another fact: Local law enforcement and prosecutors, as in North Charleston, South Carolina, have shown themselves capable of taking prompt action in appropriate cases.In the meantime, those planning to attend the Republican and Democratic National Conventions in Cleveland and Philadelphia, respectively, must be aware of the possibility of violence. Things seem to be spinning out of control.That's not a favorable setting for a presidential candidate of the party in power, particularly a candidate like Hillary Clinton, who has echoed Obama's statements on policing and whose own lawlessness has gone unpunished by those in authority.It brings back memories of the disorder of urban riots in the 1960s and the lawlessness of Watergate in the 1970s. Clinton's one strong argument -- the unsuitability of Donald Trump -- may be enough to elect her president. But maybe not.

225,MAC,"Is your home office or small office starting to show its age, technology-wise? If so, then here are some suggestions for adding some shiny new and useful devices.
"
226,MAC,"Ruth Paloma Rivera just bought her first home, battling her way through the paperwork obstacle course that is the post-crisis American banking system. In her initial attempt at obtaining a mortgage, the bank wanted a copy of her diploma from Rutgers University, where she earned a bachelor’s degree in political science. It asked for years of telephone bills and a letter from her credit unions to ensure that she was in “good standing,” she said. Because of a mistake on her application, the bank also requested verification of her permanent residency status. Rivera, 28, was born in Puerto Rico, which makes her a U.S. citizen.“It has been a really long, daunting, hard process,” she said.Rivera’s financial background would make many banks nervous. She had multiple jobs after graduation. She temporarily stopped paying some of her student loans because her wages were so low. She was turned down for a credit card. And the house she wanted to buy -- a three-story walk-up on the risky streets of North Philadelphia -- needs major repairs. But she also spent almost two years rebuilding her credit record, including moving in with her mother to cut expenses, so she could qualify for a mortgage.Her experience, and that of millions of other Americans, exemplifies what Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen calls a “headwind” for the economy: It’s hard to get a loan. Bad mortgages were at the epicenter of the financial crisis in 2008-2009, the worst since the Great Depression. Since then, regulators have swarmed over the financial system, imposing tougher rules while levying billions in fines.The credit constraints have big implications in an election year that’s seen Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders become the protest candidates of Americans who feel excluded from economic growth. In a globalized world where companies can move some service and production jobs across borders, wages are constantly under pressure, and financial security is increasingly about asset ownership.Housing -- the traditional way Americans became stakeholders -- has become more elusive. The national homeownership rate fell 5.1 percentage points, to 63.8% at the end of 2015, from the final quarter of 2006. The decline cuts hard across racial lines, dropping 3.8 percentage points for white owners and 6.3 percentage points for those who are black. The rate for Hispanics declined 2.8 percentage points.There are multiple causes of tight credit, which has lasted far longer than economists expected. The 2010 Dodd-Frank Act directed the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to establish a minimum standard for mortgage underwriting, requiring banks to verify a borrower’s ability to repay. It also established a minimum of eight criteria, including employment status, current debt obligations and credit history.Given the risk of litigation or costly management of defaulted loans, many banks simply are stepping away from riskier borrowers. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) recently told investors that its total mortgage originations fell in 2015 to $106 billion, from $166 billion in 2013; only 16% had a loan-to-value ratio of 80% or higher, compared with 39%. Spokeswoman Elizabeth Seymour declined to comment on the decline.“Banks are so scared right now, they are triple-checking every single thing,” said Laurie Goodman, director of the Housing Finance Policy Center at the Urban Institute in Washington.Borrowers also were deeply scarred by the recession.“While people are back to work, they are not at the income level they were seeing before the crisis,” said Patricia Hasson, president of Clarifi, a nonprofit credit-counseling service in Philadelphia. Many are underemployed, “making less money and carrying more of a debt load.”Rivera accumulated $27,000 in debt to get her degree and graduated in August 2010, when the U.S. unemployment rate was 9.5%.“You couldn’t even get a job at McDonald's,” she says. She found work as a substitute teacher and eventually stopped paying her student loans because she wasn’t earning enough to cover them and her other expenses. Her credit score cratered. Just how penalizing all this could be hit her hard one day when she applied for a credit card to buy a new Apple computer.“I got denied,” she said. “That summer I started my credit journey.”Her goal was bigger than buying a new Mac: After scraping by with low-paying employment, she had a revelation while watching money move in and boost property values in Philadelphia’s hipster Fishtown neighborhood. Rivera says she decided her “career” wouldn’t depend on a particular job: It would be based on owning something, building its value and then owning something more.She would start with a bet that gentrification would spread beyond Fishtown -- with its craft-beer pubs, art studios and coffee shops -- into Kensington, a nearby neighborhood with a reputation for heroin dealing and crime. But Kensington also has colorful street murals and corner bodegas, a testament to its Puerto Rican, black and Dominican population. And development money now is flowing into its southern borders from millennials and first-time homebuyers priced out of more expensive neighborhoods to the southeast, according to Chris Somers, an owner of a Re/Max (RMAX) Access real-estate brokerage who also develops local properties.“People feel more and more comfortable going into these fringe areas because they see their friends going there and development happening every week,” he said.Rivera began looking at homes and also began exploring mortgage options. Any bank assessing the risk of loaning her money would ask two basic questions: Will she pay it back, and will the property at least cover the debt if she doesn’t? Two metrics would help determine the answers: an appraisal and a credit score based in part on how she’d repaid past debts.She was already working on cleaning up her score, the benchmark ranking for borrowers that credit-reporting companies calculate. The range is from 300 to 850. Hers had been in the 500s -- considered risky -- and she was obsessive about raising it.She scrimped, she saved, she moved in with her mom. There were no trips and no shopping sprees. She opened an account without a debit card at a credit union, making it more difficult to withdraw money.“I sacrificed,” she said.With some tough-love urging from advisers at Clarifi, she paid off one $1,000 college loan and began making the others current.After about 18 months, she says her credit score crossed into the 700s, a level that lenders consider a good risk, and she decided to make her move.She had already decided on the house in North Philadelphia, which she knew intuitively was “the one” when she found it, she said. But as collateral for a mortgage, it would look risky to some lenders: The property is more than seven decades old. Its stairs are dangerous and the basement is damp. The doors, floors and walls all needed fixing. So she’d have to use part of her mortgage loan for home improvements.Rivera also had a record of frequent job changes; in addition to working as a substitute teacher, she’d also been a youth counselor, cashier for a ferry-boat company and a security-company dispatcher.She started with a bank that offered grants for first-time homebuyers, then the loan officers moved to Meridian Bank (EBSB) in Plymouth Meeting, Pa. In addition to requests for her diploma and telephone bills, Meridian asked for the contractor doing her renovations to “add what permit costs are involved,” according to an email she provided. It also wanted itemized “labor and material costs” and the information about her citizenship.Tom Campbell, a Meridian senior vice president in charge of residential lending, said specifics on labor, materials and permit costs are required by government guidelines for the type of purchase-and-renovation loan Rivera wanted.The bank also had to establish her residency status because of government guarantees on the loan, he said: Boxes in the citizenship section of her application were mismarked, and the underwriter asked about it. Campbell added that also it’s common for lenders to ask for proof of college attainment from borrowers who have held multiple jobs.Campbell says Rivera’s application ultimately was considered incomplete because the bank’s questions weren’t sufficiently answered.“We sit here and constantly complain that we have to put people through the wringer,” he said. His bank provides loans to many low-income borrowers, and there should be a balance between too little and too much regulation, he added.Rivera switched banks on the advice of her real-estate agent. Fearing she would lose the house, she offered to pay the seller rent, even though she wouldn’t be living there. The seller agreed. Rivera kept a radio playing in the kitchen and the lights on for about two months to ward off thieves who might steal copper piping and wire.Her persistence paid off. On March 18, her odyssey ended when she finally got a loan from Quaint Oak Bancorp based in Southampton, Pa., and closed on the house. Owning property is “empowering,” Rivera said, and she’s encouraged about her financial future for the first time since she left college.“I really want it all,” she said.

227,MAC,"Investment bank Oppenheimer on Friday lowered its revenue and earnings estimates for Apple (AAPL) in fiscal 2017 on reduced expectations for iPhone and Apple Watch sales.Oppenheimer analyst Andrew Uerkwitz maintained his perform rating on Apple stock, citing a ""cautious view for the iPhone 7.""Apple is expected to release its 10th-generation smartphone, the rumored iPhone 7, in September. The handset is widely believed to be an incremental upgrade to the current iPhone 6S series.""We expect the iPhone 7 product cycle to be weak due to lack of major improvements,"" Uerkwitz said in a research report. ""We maintain that more dramatic changes will come to the iPhone in 2017.""For fiscal 2017, which starts Sept. 25, Uerkwitz now expects Apple to earn $8.18 a share on sales of $209 billion. That's down from his prior forecast for $9.04 EPS on $222 billion in sales.He lowered his forecast for iPhone shipments in fiscal 2017 to 197 million units from 213 million.""We believe incremental design changes this year will not be compelling enough to drive an upgrade cycle and continue to believe the 7 cycle will undersell the 6S cycle,"" Uerkwitz said.Uerkwitz expects iPhone unit sales to fall 10% year over year to 208 million units in fiscal 2016. His fiscal 2017 forecast predicts a 5% decrease in iPhone unit sales.He predicts that Mac computer unit sales will fall 9.7% in fiscal 2016 and rise 0.9% in 2017. He sees iPad unit sales falling 20.9% this year and 13.5% next.Uerkwitz believes Apple Watch sales will rise 83% to 11 million units this year and will add 59% to 17.5 million in fiscal 2017.Apple stock rose 0.8% to 96.68 on the stock market today. On Thursday, Apple stock broke through its 50-day moving average, a positive sign for shares.RELATED:Apple Stock Could Rally Ahead Of iPhone 7 Launch, Piper Jaffray Says.

228,MAC,"Microsoft's (MSFT) Windows 10 operating system rose to 19.1% market share in June as the software giant continued its aggressive campaign to get users of older operating systems to upgrade.Owners of Windows 7 and Windows 8 personal computers have until July 29 to get a free upgrade to Windows 10. After that, they'll have to buy it. Windows 10 currently costs $119.99.Microsoft has caught flak for its upgrade campaign, which has included frequent pop-up alerts to download Windows 10 and sometimes deceptive messages.In May, a woman won a $10,000 court judgment from Microsoft because her computer crashed while automatically trying to install Windows 10, which she didn't authorize, the Seattle Times reported. Because of the OS failure, she was unable to run her Sausalito, Calif., travel agency and had to buy a new PC.On Friday, Net Applications reported that the percentage of computers on the internet running Windows 10 reached 19.1% in June, up from 17.4% in May. The operating system was released 11 months ago.Microsoft announced Wednesday that it will release a major update to its Windows 10 operating system on Aug. 2. The ""anniversary update"" features improvements to security, the Cortana personal assistant software and Edge browser.Microsoft's nearly 7-year-old Windows 7 is the top operating system in use, with 49.1% market share in June. Windows 8 was third with 10.5% market share. (Microsoft skipped Windows 9 in its naming scheme.) Windows XP was fourth with 9.8% market share.Collectively, all versions of Microsoft's Windows operating system ran 89.8% of PCs online last month, followed by Apple (AAPL) Mac computers with 8.2% share. The remainder were Linux-based PCs.For mobile devices, the Android operating system from Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google held a 65.6% market share in June, Net Applications said. Apple's iOS was second 27.2%.Shares of Microsoft ended essentially flat Friday, Apple rose 0.3%, and Alphabet added 1%.

229,MAC,"Although the future of the U.S. housing market looks a bit shaky after pending home sales dropped in May, just-released figures on the market's overall stability indicate that it's been moving toward increasingly firmer ground.A monthly gauge, called the Multi-Indicator Market Index or MiMi, shows America's housing stability as making a 7.4% gain over last year, to a grade of 84.1. While that's still on the low end of the MiMi's 80-to-120 target range for stable housing activity (with 100 being the benchmark average), it marks a 42% improvement since its all-time low in October 2010. The all-time high on the MiMi, a gauge compiled by mortgage giant Freddie Mac, is 121.7, reached in April 2006. The MiMi measures current conditions against long-term normal activity for purchase applications, mortgages that are not 90-plus days delinquent or in foreclosure, local employment and the ratio of housing payments to income. (See April's scores in the accompanying chart.)
"
230,MAC,"While April marked the 48th consecutive month of year-over-year increases in the national average, there was shakiness in the payment-to-income score, which fell slightly more than 1% from March and nearly 5% from a year earlier. Freddie Mac deputy chief economist Len Kiefer saw the drop as ""reflecting the impact of lower mortgage rates,"" according to a statement accompanying the report's release.Stability of employment also dropped month-to-month, but only by 0.2%. Even so, April's score marked a 5% improvement from the same month in 2015.The most dramatic change among the four key indicators was on the positive side, though. In noting that home purchase applications were up 1.77% from March and 15.27% from a year earlier, Kiefer said ""the strong positive momentum ... is a good sign for a housing market likely to post the best year in home sales since 2006.""Comparing this year's scores for the spring buying season to last year's, 42 of the 50 states and 86 of the top 100 metropolitan areas trended higher in the three-month average; that's down from a year earlier, when 46 states and all of the top-100 metros had improved scores in that time frame.When looked at year over year, however, 49 states and the District of Columbia, were gainers, with score reversals seen only in North Dakota and Wyoming -- states hard-hit by a downturn in fossil fuel's fortunes.The District of Columbia had the highest score. Hawaii was second, Utah was third, and Colorado, Montana and Oregon tied for fourth.Those states with the most-improved year-over-year scores, ranked by percentage of increase, were Florida (15.34%); Colorado (14.73%); Nevada (14.62%); Oregon (14.46%); and New Jersey (13.48%).The metros with the highest scores were Nashville, Tenn., Honolulu, Salt Lake City, Los Angeles, and Austin, Texas. Metro areas with the most-improved year-over-year scores, ranked by percentage of increase, were Orlando, Fla. (20.17%); Tampa, Fla. (17.47%); Denver (17.39); Cape Coral, Fla. (16.69%); and Portland, Ore. (15.99%).As seen in the state results, the energy sector also had an impact among the 100 metros surveyed -- the only one to see a year-over-year decline was the oil town of Tulsa, Okla.Related:Foreclosures Keep Falling In The U.S., Though Not EverywhereAmerica's Hottest Housing Markets Are Mainly Out WestThe Best Homebuying Markets For Millennials.
"
231,MAC,"Even though the economy is in a slow-motion recovery, the real estate market is moving at full speed. Existing-home sales in May ran more than 5% ahead of last year, which itself was already the best year for sales in a decade.However, one group of Americans is notably absent from this measure of the American dream: first-time homebuyers. Historically, first-timers have made up 40% of all homebuyers. But in all of 2015 they accounted for merely 30%.With the many benefits of homeownership, why the hesitation?The answer often boils down to a lack of information. Many potential first-time buyers continue renting because they assume homeownership is only for the wealthy, those who can afford a hefty 20% down payment. They feel in their gut what economists have verified -- that saving for 20% down on an average home with an average income could take a decade or more.Here's what these aspiring but frustrated potential buyers don't know: the 20% down payment requirement is a myth. Mortgages for as little as 3% down are readily available.Still, 73% of millennials have little or no awareness of such finance options. Last year, as many as a half a million potential first-timers may have delayed home buying because of what's in their heads, not what's in their wallets.Most first-time buyers belong to the millennial generation, those in the 19-35 age group. The formative experience of their youth was the great recession, with its devastating foreclosure debacle.They're graduating from college with a record amount of student debt and entering the workforce only to find limited opportunity and stagnant wage growth. It's not surprising that they are getting married and having children later than previous generations. Although repeated surveys reveal that they aspire to own a home, they're largely unaware of mortgages designed specifically for them.The Federal Housing Authority has supported mortgages with just 3.5% down for decades and has traditionally been the mortgage of choice for most first-time homebuyers. As a direct result of the great recession, lending standards became overly restrictive -- but they are now much more reasonable. In 2014, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac both began guaranteeing mortgages with down payments as low as 3%, which are available through responsible lenders nationwide.Like all mortgages, low down-payment programs still require good credit and verifiable income, and they may impose additional requirements such as mortgage insurance. But when combined with near historic lows in interest rates, such mortgages represent an attractive opportunity for first-time homebuyers.What's more, rents have been escalating faster than home prices. The percentage of an average income needed for rent often exceeds that needed for a mortgage payment. Depending on individual financial circumstances, a low-down payment mortgage could actually improve monthly cash flow for many buyers.Those pondering the prospect of homeownership should understand that mortgage interest, property taxes, and some closing costs are all deductible and can significantly reduce one's tax bill. But there are a number of lesser known advantages that warrant as much -- if not more -- consideration.For many Americans, homeownership is the single greatest contributor to building wealth. The net worth of homeowners is far greater than that of renters -- a truth that persisted even through the financial crisis. Additionally, homeownership creates a stronger bond to the neighborhood and is a good predictor of positive outcomes for children. Indeed, children of homeowners are much more likely to finish high school.Unfortunately, the mistaken belief that a large down payment is required to buy a home is preventing many who are creditworthy from enjoying the benefits of homeownership. In reality, today's real estate market is very receptive to first-time buyers. Millennials may be facing many challenges and uncertainties, but getting into a home of their own needn't be one of them.

232,MAC,"Apple’s (AAPL) latest software updates for its four main device platforms were mostly about playing catch-up with competitors, analysts said Tuesday.Apple executives outlined improvements to software for the iPhone, Apple Watch, Apple TV and Mac computers during a keynote presentation at the company's Worldwide Developers Conference on Monday in San Francisco.Investors were unimpressed with the news. Apple shares dropped 1.5% on Monday, after the keynote. Apple closed 0.1% higher at 97.46 on the stock market today.“Many of Apple’s announcements appeared to be playing catch-up vs. competitive offerings or were attempts to close the gap on shortcomings with existing Apple offerings,” Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi said in a research report.These included Apple’s Siri personal assistant app vs. Amazon’s (AMZN) Alexa, Apple Maps vs. Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Google Maps, and Apple iMessage vs. Facebook (FB) Messenger and others, he said.In the case of shortcomings to current Apple products, the company promised to speed up sluggish Apple Watch performance and clean up the messy Apple Music interface.That said, Sacconaghi said he was impressed by the improved level of integration across Apple’s hardware and software that the company demonstrated Monday. Those changes should improve the Apple user experience and may strengthen product loyalty, he said.UBS analyst Steven Milunovich said many of Apple’s updates were compelling “even if many features were catch-up.”Highlights included improving the Apple Watch interface by making it more intuitive; having a single sign-on for pay TV channels on Apple TV and mobile devices; and expanding Apple Pay to web purchases on Mac computers. He also liked that Apple had opened up Siri and iMessage to third-party software developers.Opening Siri and iMessage to outside developers could help Apple in the “machine learning and chatbot wars developing in which Apple is perceived to be lagging,” Milunovich said in a report.Needham analyst Laura Martin said software updates aren’t as sexy as new hardware, but they can be just as important.“We expect Apple’s content upgrades to deepen folks’ relationship with their iOS devices and to elongate consumers' daily usage time,” she said in a report.Apple's latest software updates to its iOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS point to new hardware on the horizon, Wells Fargo analyst Maynard Um said. Apple likely will introduce new iPhone, Mac computer, Apple Watch and Apple TV products this fall ahead of the holiday shopping season, Um said in a report.
"
233,MAC,"Even in this age of runaway emotions, there are still some people who want to know the facts. Nowhere are facts more important, or more lacking, than in what has been aptly called ""The War on Cops,"" the title of a devastating new book by Heather Mac Donald.Few, if any, of the most fashionable notions about the police, minorities and the criminal justice system can withstand an examination of hard facts. Yet those fashionable notions continue to dominate discussions in the media, in politics and in academia. But Ms. Mac Donald's book of documented facts demolishes many fashionable notions.Consider one of the big talking points of politicians and others who claim that the harsher penalties for people selling crack cocaine than for people selling powder cocaine show racism, since crack cocaine is more likely to be used by blacks.The cold fact, however, is that black political and community leaders, back in the 1980s, spearheaded the drive for more severe legal penalties against those who sold crack cocaine. Black Congressman Charlie Rangel of Harlem was just one of those black leaders who urged these more severe penalties. So did the New York Times, the promoter of many crusades on the left.Fast forward to the present, when both black leaders and the New York Times are blaming white racism for the more severe penalties for selling crack cocaine. If you want to see what they were saying back in the 1980s, check pages 154-159 of ""The War on Cops.""When the political winds change, politicians change. But that does not change the facts about what they said and did before.As in her previous book, ""Are Cops Racist?"" Heather Mac Donald put hard facts front and center -- and those facts devastate many a fashionable notion in the media, in politics and in academia.One of the most popular arguments used in many different contexts is to show that blacks have been disproportionately represented among people stopped by police, arrested or imprisoned, as well as disproportionately represented among people turned down for mortgage loans or for other benefits.Although many people regard these ""disparate impact"" statistics as evidence, or virtually proof, of racial discrimination, suppose that I should tell you that black basketball players are penalized by NBA referees out of all proportion to the 13% that blacks are in the American population.""Wait a minute!"" you might respond. ""Blacks are more than just 13% of the players in the NBA.""Black basketball players are several times more numerous than 13% of all NBA players. This is especially so among the star players, who are more likely to be on the floor, rather than sitting on the bench. And players on the floor most are the ones most likely to get penalized.The difference between the percentage of blacks in the general population and the percentage of blacks in the particular activity being discussed is the key to the fraudulent use of ""disparate impact"" statistics in many other contexts.Hillary Clinton, for example, decried a ""disgrace of a criminal-justice system that incarcerates so many more African-Americans proportionately than whites.""The most reliable crime statistics are statistics on murders, 52% of which were committed by blacks over the period from 1976 to 2005. If blacks are convicted of far more than 13% of all murders, does that mean that racism in the courts must be the reason?On the benefits side, there was instant condemnation of mortgage lenders when statistics showed blacks being turned down for prime mortgage loans in 2000 at twice the rate that whites were turned down.Seldom, if ever, did the media report that whites were turned down at nearly twice the rate that Asian-Americans were turned down -- or that Asian-Americans' average credit scores were higher than the average credit scores of whites, which were higher than the average credit scores of blacks.Such facts would have spoiled the prevailing preconceptions. Many facts reported in ""The War on Cops"" spoil many notions that all too many people choose to believe. We need to stop this nonsense, before there is a race war that no one can win.This is the second of two parts.
"
234,MAC,"President Barack Obama and his first attorney general, Eric Holder, called for an honest conversation about race. Holder even called us ""a nation of cowards"" because we were unwilling to have a ""national conversation"" about race. The truth of the matter is there's been more than a half-century of conversations about race. We do not need more. Instead, black people need to have frank conversations among ourselves, no matter how uncomfortable and embarrassing the topics may be.Among the nation's most dangerous cities are Detroit, Chicago, St. Louis, Baltimore, Memphis, Milwaukee, Birmingham, Newark, Cleveland and Philadelphia. These once-thriving cities are in steep decline. What these cities have in common is that they have large black populations. Also, they have been run by Democrats for nearly a half-century, with blacks having significant political power. Other characteristics these cities share are poorly performing and unsafe schools, poor-quality city services and declining populations.Each year, more than 7,000 blacks are murdered. That's a number greater than white and Hispanic murder victims combined. Blacks of all ages are killed at six times the rate of whites and Hispanics combined. According to the FBI, the police kill about 400 people a year; blacks are roughly one-third of that number. In Chicago alone, so far this year, over 2,000 people have been shot, leaving over 320 dead. It's a similar tale of mayhem in other predominantly black cities.Heather Mac Donald's most recent book, ""The War on Cops,"" points out some devastating and sobering statistics: ""Blacks were charged with 62% of all robberies, 57% of all murders, and 45% of all assaults in the 75 largest U.S. counties in 2009, while constituting roughly 15% of the population in those counties. From 2005 to 2014, 40% of cop-killers were black. Given the racially lopsided nature of gun violence, a 26% rate of black victimization by the police is not evidence of bias.""The primary victims of lawlessness are black people. To address this problem and most others, black people should ignore the liberal agenda. If civil authorities will not do their job of creating a safe environment, then black people should take the initiative. One example comes to mind. In 1988, at the request of residents, Black Muslims began to patrol Mayfair Mansions, a drug-infested, gang-ridden, unsafe Washington, D.C., housing project. The gangs and drug lords left. The Nation of Islam sentinels were not deterred by the wishes of politicians and the American Civil Liberties Union. They didn't feel obliged to give kid glove treatment to criminals. Black residents of crime-infested neighborhoods should set up patrols, armed if necessary, to challenge thugs, gangs, drug dealers and other miscreants and make black neighborhoods safe and respectable. No one should have to live in daily fear for his life and safety. Most Americans have no idea of -- and wouldn't begin to tolerate -- the climate of fear and intimidation under which so many black people live.Without self-initiative, there is not much that can be done about the high crime rate in black neighborhoods. Black and white liberals and their allies in the ACLU, as well as many libertarians, will not countenance the kind of tools needed to bring about civility. For example, the Chicago Police Department recently entered an agreement with the ACLU to record contact cards for all street stops. The ACLU claimed that police were disproportionately targeting minorities for questioning and searches. The practical result will be fewer investigative stops by police and more crime, and it will be black residents who suffer.Black people have the capacity to run the criminals out of their neighborhoods. Let me put the issue another way. Suppose it were the Ku Klux Klan riding through black neighborhoods murdering 7,000 blacks year after year. How many black people would be willing to wait for the Klansmen to behave themselves or accept political promises and wait for a government program?

235,MAC,"Investor sentiment toward Apple (AAPL) is so negative that even in-line results for fiscal Q3 and guidance for Q4 could drive the stock higher, says Pacific Crest Securities.Pacific Crest analyst Andy Hargreaves, in a research report Sunday, reiterated his overweight rating on Apple stock but cut his price target to 121 from 123.Apple shares rose 0.3% to 96.98 on the stock market today. The stock rose above its 50-day moving average for the first time in weeks last week.Apple is scheduled to report fiscal-third-quarter earnings and give fourth-quarter guidance on July 26.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Apple to earn $1.39 a share on sales of $42.02 billion in the June quarter. On a year-over-year basis, earnings per share would be down 25% and sales would be down 15%.For the September quarter, analysts are modeling Apple to earn $1.63, down 17%, on sales of $46.08 billion, down 11%.""Investor sentiment appears quite negative, and we believe in-line fiscal Q3 results and fiscal Q4 guidance could drive the shares higher,"" Hargreaves said. ""We are slightly reducing our estimates to account for potentially slower consumer spending in Europe, but continue to see the risk/reward on AAPL as favorable.""If Apple provides in-line guidance for fiscal Q4, it ""should provide a measure of relief to investors who are concerned about further deterioration through the iPhone 7 cycle,"" Hargreaves said.Recent supply chain checks suggest that orders for iPhone 7 series handsets in the second half of 2016 could be down 20% vs. the orders for the iPhone 6S series during the same period last year, he said.Hargreaves slightly reduced his iPhone and Mac sales estimates this year to account for a potential slowdown in European spending after the U.K.'s vote to leave the European Union.RELATED:Apple Stock Climbs Despite Cautious Report On iPhone 7

236,MAC,"HP Inc. (HPQ) narrowed the gap with No. 1 PC vendor Lenovo in the second quarter, research firm IDC said late Monday.HP increased its personal computer shipments by 5.1% year over year in Q2 to 12.96 million units. It increased its worldwide PC market share to 20.8% from 18.9% a year earlier. China-based Lenovo continues to lead, but its PC shipments fell 2.3% to 13.2 million units. But since Lenovo's decline was less than the overall market decline, its market share actually increased to 21.2% from 20.7%, IDC said.Total PC shipments fell 4.5% to 62.4 million units in Q2. That's better than the forecast decline of 7.4%.Dell held on to third place with 16% market share, followed by Asus (7.2%) and Apple (AAPL) (7.1%).Apple showed the biggest decline among the top five PC vendors, down 8.3% year over year.Improved inventory levels put the PC market on a better footing for the second half of the year, IDC said. Also, the expiration of free upgrades to Microsoft's (MSFT) Windows 10 at the end of the month might spur people into buying new systems, the research firm said.In the U.S., PC shipments rose 4.9% to 17.03 million units in the second quarter, IDC said. Among the top five vendors, Apple was a laggard, notching a 7.6% decline in Mac shipments. The other four top U.S. vendors posted double-digit increases in Q2.HP is the No. 1 PC vendor in the U.S., with 27.9% market share in Q2. Dell is second with 25.8% market share, followed by Lenovo (14%), Apple (11.2%) and Acer (5.2%), IDC said.Rival market research firm Gartner (IT) late Monday estimated that worldwide PC shipments fell 5.2% to 64.3 million units. It was the seventh consecutive quarter of PC shipment declines, but Gartner analysts said the market is showing some signs of improvement.

237,MAC,"Chipotle Mexican Grill's (CMG) move to trademark ""Better Burger"" didn't just signal a possible new burger chain. It also underscores that Chipotle's core business may have peaked.Chipotle is just starting to recover from a slew of E. coli and norovirus outbreaks at several of its restaurants late last year, with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ending its investigation on Feb. 1. Same-store sales plunged 14.6% in the fourth quarter and were down 26% in February. Chipotle has predicted it would report its first-ever quarterly loss in Q1.The burrito giant should see a rebound in sales from depressed levels. Consumer sentiment regarding Chipotle bottomed in January, according to William Blair analyst Sharon Zackfia on Friday, citing her survey  of 800 adults. But while Chipotle's stock also bottomed in January, it hasn't made much of a recovery.IBD's Take: How Healthy Is Chipotle's stock and how does it stack up vs. rivals?But Chipotle's growth was decelerating rapidly, even before the food illness outbreaks. And other industry data also suggest that demand for Mexican food generally is no longer outpacing other types of cuisine.Chipotle is the king of fast casual eateries, as well as the clear leader among similar Tex-Mex chains, such as Jack In The Box (JACK)-owned Qdoba Mexican Eats, privately owned Freebirds World Burrito and more.But the Mexican restaurant sector is maturing, while upscale burger chains are growing in popularity, according to market tracking firm Technomic's President Darren Tristano.""When we looked at the market in 2015, sales in the (upscale) 'better burger' category grew 15%. Mexican slowed down to only 7% or 8%,"" he told IBD. Mexican restaurant growth had also been in the double digits.Take a look at the figures for high-flying burger chain Shake Shack (SHAK). There, sales rose 47%, but that was just $51 million compared with Chipotle's revenue at just under $1 billion in the fourth quarter.Chipotle needs to continue diversifying to grow, Tristano said.""When you have such large sales growth, it has to slow down. We saw that with a lot of other fast casuals too,"" he said.Sandwich and bakery chain Panera Bread (PNRA) used to enjoy double-digit and then high-single-digit same-store growth. But in the fourth quarter, that was reduced to 3.4%.It's not surprising that Chipotle's growth has faltered, but what is astounding is that it stayed so high for so long. In the fourth quarter of 2013, Chipotle's same-store sales rose a robust 9.3% vs. a year earlier. But comparable growth then accelerated every quarter until it peaked at 19.8% in the third quarter of 2014.""It was just getting bigger and bigger a few years ago,"" Argus Research analyst John Staszak said. ""Comparisons were getting more difficult.""Same-store sales growth cooled to 16.1% in Q4 2014, then to 10.4%, 4.3% and 2.6% in the first three quarters of 2015, respectively. Some of that was due to carnitas shortages as the company sought more humane suppliers.Another factor to consider is that Chipotle's food-illness woes haven't necessarily helped rivals. Jack-In-The-Box's Qdoba reported same-store sales growth slowed to 1.8% in its latest quarter, down from 14% a year earlier.Total U.S. Mexican restaurant sales grew at a 2.9% annual rate from 2010 to 2015, when they reached $38 billion, IBISWorld said in a report. The market tracker forecasts growth will slow to 2.5% a year for the 2015-2020 period.Further, Chipotle and its peers are losing ground when it comes to satisfying the public's appetite for hotter cuisines. Diners still love spicy foods, but that's expanded beyond Mexican and Asian dishes to fare such as KFC's spicy chicken wings and Restaurant Brands International (QSR)-owned Burger King's ""Angriest Whopper,"" which features hot sauce in the bun.""People looking for spicy foods might be headed for a Mexican restaurant, but there are many other choices for Americans now,"" Tristano said.Chipotle has already expanded into the Asian food sector with its ShopHouse Southeast Asian Kitchen restaurants, though it hasn't rapidly increased those locations. It's dipped its toe into the fast-growing custom pizza sector by investing in the Locale pizzeria chain.Despite slowing growth, analysts are still bullish on Chipotle.""There is still strong association with the Chipotle brand. People have very short memories"" for health scares, said Bonnie Riggs, restaurant analyst for market-tracking firm NPD Group.In addition to eyeing the high-end burger sector, Chipotle at the end of March began testing an expanded drinks menu at a store in its home city of Denver as another way to regain customers and boost same-store sales and margins. Some analysts still see an opportunity to expand into breakfast.And the biggest mid-term source of growth is simply creating more Chipotle locations. The company added 192 stores in 2014 and 229 locations in 2015, with 220-235 planned in 2016.Investors can take heart, however. A restaurant operator that is maturing doesn't necessarily mean a death knell for the stock. Investors can, and usually do, reset expectations.Take a look at Panera, which is trading at-all time highs. There's also the fast-food king, McDonald's (MCD), which has rebounded to record highs, largely over excitement that U.S. same-store sales have turned positive following a long slump.And don't forget that expanding into burgers would bring some symmetry to Chipotle's story. McDonald's, home of the Big Mac, was a big Chipotle investor before divesting its stake.

Near-term ad growth drivers include Facebook's video- and photo-sharing site Instagram and its premium video, which brings in high ad rates.He says Wall Street's projections for Facebook are too conservative and underestimate the long-term moneymaking potential of other products, including Messenger and WhatsApp. Ju has a price target on Facebook stock of 135. Facebook stock was down 2.5%, near 110, in afternoon trading in the stock market today.Amazon, Ju's No. 2 investment, should provide upside to estimates, he says, in part from ongoing strength in e-commerce. Ju has a price target on Amazon of 800. Amazon stock was up a fraction Friday afternoon, near 593.Ju expects Alphabet to narrow the monetization gap between mobile and desktop, while increasing ad loads. He also expects Alphabet to get strong growth from YouTube and its Google Play app store. His price target on Alphabet stock is 930. Alphabet stock was down a fraction Friday afternoon, near 756.Regarding Apple, Credit Suisse analyst Kulbinder Garcha rates it a top investment idea, saying multiple growth drivers include its strength with the iPhone, iPad and Mac computer and greater adoption of the iOS ecosystem.

It's ultimately to seed a group of Spanish-speaking people who will someday help Mexico take back the Southwest.Don't laugh. It's not a paranoid vision. Mexico has never accepted U.S. sovereignty over what was once its land. And radical U.S. Latino rights groups -- including, most significantly, MeCha and La Raza -- have long agitated to return the Southwest to Mexico. What better way for a ""reconquista"" -- a reconquering -- of the Southwest than by the ballot box?""This is the other Mexico,"" Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto crowed in Los Angeles in August 2014, referring to the United States. He meant it. But he's not alone. He's part of a long line of recent Mexican politicians who, emboldened by the presence of an estimated 12 million of their own citizens living in the U.S., have chosen to pick at the scab of Mexican separatism.As far back as 1994, President Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico proposed ""dual nationality"" for all people of Mexican extraction. That's about 33 million people in the U.S. Whose flag would they pledge allegiance to?Former President Vicente Fox, who in the context of Mexico is considered a conservative, has let it be known numerous times that he favors Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump. No doubt he finds the prospect of Trump building a fence to keep out illegal immigrants offensive. But imagine if an American politician went south of the border and began pointedly politicking for one candidate over another? He would be loudly reviled as a Yanqui Imperialist.But this goes beyond mere politicking -- and extends into undermining U.S. law. Mexico has long offered a ""Guia del Migrante Mexicano,"" a comic-book style guide for those entering the U.S. illegally. Far from dissuading their citizens from coming here, they encourage it. Mexican officials and radical immigration groups then encourage Spanish-only ghettoization of Mexicans and Central Americans, along with a sense of grievance and victimhood for non-existent U.S. crimes.Mexican consuls in the U.S. have repeatedly criticized U.S. law officials when they enforce U.S. law against illegal immigration. They hand out so-called ""matriculas"" -- a form of ID -- and lobby to have them accepted to get everything from drivers' licenses to bank accounts. Most offensively, they spend huge sums for Mexican textbooks to be used in U.S. schools with large Hispanic populations, all but guaranteeing that the kids who learn from them will remain unassimilated into the American way of life.""After pressing us to educate Mexico's citizens, give them food stamps, deliver their babies, provide them with hospital beds and police their neighborhoods, the Mexican government also expects us to help preserve their loyalty -- to Mexico,"" wrote Heather Mac Donald, in a prescient article for the City Journal in 2005.Mexican presidents, past and present, along with other politicians, are no doubt sincere on some level. But they never quite seem to catch on -- their citizens come here by the millions because of the failures of Mexico's corrupt political class.Instead of meddling in U.S. politics and immigration policy for the false dream of reclaiming lost land, Mexico's officials would be wise to reform their own country by securing and promoting the rule of law, freeing up their markets, protecting property rights and ending the endemic political corruption that has driven tens of millions of Mexicans north.

240,MAC,"Apple (AAPL) is widely expected to remove the legacy audio jack from the upcoming iPhone 7, a move that could upset many customers who have wired headsets they like to use.Apple is believed to be ditching the 3.5-millimeter analog port in order to make the next iPhone slightly thinner. People who want to use headphones with the iPhone 7 would have to switch to Bluetooth wireless headphones or headphones that plug into Apple's proprietary, multifunction Lightning connector. Apple might include a Lightning port adapter for 3.5-mm audio-jack headphones with the iPhone 7.More than 300,000 people have signed an online petition urging Apple not to eliminate the headphone socket from the next iPhone, expected to be released in September.""Not only will this force iPhone users to dole out additional cash to replace their hi-fi headphones, it will single-handedly create mountains of electronic waste that likely won't get recycled,"" the Sum of Us petition says.Apple has a history of being the first tech company to eliminate older standards in favor of new technology. For instance, it famously abandoned floppy disk and CD drives from its Mac computers before others eventually followed suit. It also refused to support Adobe (ADBE) Flash in its iOS mobile devices.But with this transition, Apple won't have its iconic co-founder and CEO Steve Jobs to sell the change to the Apple faithful.Jobs would make Apple customers feel noble and empowered about leaving old technologies behind, said Roger Kay, an analyst with Endpoint Technologies Associates.""'Get rid of that old stuff' would be his answer,"" Kay said.Canaccord Genuity analyst Mike Walkley concurred.""He'd give a speech and everybody would walk out saying, 'I've got to get this new headset,'"" he said.Without Jobs to convince customers, you can expect a lot of grumbling about the lack of an audio jack, Walkley said.""They'll probably upset everybody for a few months and by the time the iPhone 8 comes out (expected in the fall of 2017) people will have accepted it,"" he said.But Edison Investment Research analyst Richard Windsor said eliminating the headphone jack doesn't make sense.""Getting rid of it would create more problems that it would solve,"" he said in a research report Thursday.The iPhone is thin enough, he said. If it gets any thinner, it could have less structural rigidity and be more susceptible to being bent.

242,MAC,"Financial markets and the Federal Reserve have been giving a preview of the fallout from a U.K. vote to leave the European Union: lower stock prices, lower Treasury yields and a higher dollar.The vote tally late Thursday pointed to the Leave camp winning. U.S. stock futures are selling off very hard overnight, but analysts generally agree that U.S. stocks would likely be much more attractive under Brexit than U.K. or European equities.Morgan Stanley has said it expects European equities to sink 15% within six months of a Brexit vote, while the euro sinks 11.5% vs. the dollar.""While the U.S. won't be immune if the world turns more nationalistic and protectionist, it will be less adversely affected than most other countries,"" wrote Ed Yardeni, chief investment strategist at Yardeni Research. ""That's because the U.S. economy is more resilient, diversified and self-contained than all other ones.""Retail, food and utility stock groups have been among the market's top-performing industries in recent weeks. Some homebuilder stocks are near breakouts, with lower-for-longer rates providing support to the housing sector.Health care can be attractive as a steady growth sector. UnitedHealth Group (UNH) is trading near highs, outperforming the general market for months.More domestic-focused companies may be an even surer bet for two reasons.First, upward pressure on the dollar is a drag on the earnings of multinationals such as General Electric (GE) that derive a large percentage of sales and profits from exports and overseas operations.As Citigroup strategists noted: ""The dollar's relative weakness in 2016 has been important for broader (second-half of 2016) S&P 500 EPS expectations, and thus a strengthening of the buck would imply that downward earnings pressures could be revived and act as a new restraint on share prices.""Further, a Brexit vote is seen as possibly tipping the U.K. into recession and acting as a drag on already-tepid growth in the EU and around the globe.Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said earlier this month that if Brexit becomes a reality, the firm will cut its 2017 growth forecast from 2.4% to zero for the U.K., and to 1.0% from 1.8% for the euro zone.That would mean ""another year of the global economy being stuck in low gear,"" Behravesh said.With emerging markets, commodities prices and U.S. multinationals' foreign earnings taking a hit from Brexit, Ram Gandikota, senior portfolio manager at Ativo Capital Management, expects U.S. consumer-focused stocks and defensive areas like utilities to benefit. Gold is likely to rise as investors ""flock to safety assets in the short term,"" he said.Gold and gold-related stocks and ETFs also have done well.The severity of the economic consequences from the pro-Brexit vote are hard to predict. One concern is that Brexit reflects broader discontent with centralized European institutions, including the euro monetary regime that the U.K. never joined.The economic and financial market disruption from the Brexit the will put more pressure on remaining EU members to make their fiscal, banking and immigration agreements more effective and palatable. Otherwise, anti-European-establishment political parties may continue to strengthen and follow the U.K.'s lead.Without the U.K. paying its membership dues, countries like Spain and Germany will be called on to pay more, Gandikota said. He sees prospects for further European integration ""getting worse and worse"" as public sentiment deteriorates. If the U.K. manages to endure Brexit without much hardship, the outlook for the eurozone will become even worse, because it would make leaving the EU seem less scary, he said.A Brexit vote would put more pressure on central banks to do more. The European Central Bank reportedly has promised to backstop financial markets if U.K. votes to ""Leave."" Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen noted last Wednesday that a pro-Brexit vote would likely impact Fed policy in the months to come. The Bank of Japan may also have to take more extreme measures to limit an expected further rise in the yen.Lower interest rates for longer may be a positive for the U.S. housing and auto sectors. The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged just 3.56% in the past week, Freddie Mac said on Thursday.But automaker stocks have been weak, partly on global sales concerns but also on fears that U.S. demand is near a peak.Housing looks a like a more attractive opportunity than autos, Yardeni said. Health care is another domestic-focused area where investors can find healthy growth relative to ""a world of secular stagnation,"" he said.On the other hand, U.S. banks will continue to face a tough environment with low rates contributing to narrow net interest margins. Bank of America (BAC) reportedly will lay off as many as 8,000 employees in its consumer division.Analysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods expect an earnings hit to JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Goldman Sachs (GS) and other big banks from weaker capital markets activity in the U.K.A pro-Brexit vote would likewise hurt American Airlines (AAL) and other global carriers, such as United Continental (UAL) and Delta Air Lines (DAL). It would disrupt business travel in the short run as companies put decisions on hold. Slower economic growth in Europe would be a longer-term problem.

243,MAC,"Top technology players are gathering at the Game Developers Conference this week to discuss new developments in virtual reality, but one big name is missing from what could be the next big thing: Apple (AAPL).Facebook (FB), Sony (SNE), Alphabet (GOOGL)-owned Google, Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) are racing to stake claims in a medium that looks to revolutionize consumer technology.Meanwhile, Apple is planning a March 21 spring product event where it's expected to launch slightly different versions of existing products.""Apple needs to do something (in VR) at some point, because if they don't . . . it would be as significant as them missing the iPhone, as hard as it is to believe,"" Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster told IBD. ""But that's how big of a deal VR is going to be.""Billions of dollars of investments in hardware, software and content provide evidence that virtual reality isn't a far-off dream, but the ""next computing paradigm,"" according to analysts.Yet for now, Apple is selling more of the same and remains dependent on the iPhone, as its smartwatch, tablet and set-top box have failed to be catalysts for major, sustained growth.Apple typically takes it slow when it comes to entering new markets. Munster says the tech company learns from and improves on what other companies have produced but haven't ""figured out,"" such as the music player, the phone and wearables.He thinks Apple is actually doing the right thing by letting the basics of the VR market get figured out first, and expects that the company will offer a consumer-level headset in about two years. He also sees more third parties creating headsets that utilize the iPhone, much like Samsung Gear VR, for lower-quality applications as soon as this year.But there's a potential disadvantage for Apple in letting others be the first movers in the virtual reality market.""If one of the other competitors gets it right (has explosive growth), right out of the gate, then it's playing catch-up and that's a difficult position to be in,"" Munster said.And not only is Apple absent from VR headsets, its high-end desktop computer can't handle other companies' 360-degree viewing gear, according to Palmer Luckey, founder of Facebook-owned Oculus.The Oculus Rift headset would have Mac OS support ""if they ever release a good computer,"" he told Shacknews.To be sure, the Cupertino, Calif.-based company has made investments in the augmented reality space over the past few years, with the acquisitions of Metaio and Flyby Media, and has hired VR talent.But Apple's efforts to enter a new market seem focused more on developing a car, rather than something that's in a more similar product category as its other gadgets.Apple still has a window of opportunity as its rivals' VR products require steep up-front costs from consumers. Oculus will begin shipments of the $599 Rift headset on March 28. The HTC Vive will launch in early April at $799. But consumers will also need to have gamer-level PCs, which can cost more than $1,000.That barrier to entry that may leave some breathing room for a late move from Apple.Abi Mandelbaum, CEO of interactive VR-content platform YouVisit, says that Oculus' strategy is stifling VR's ability to go mainstream to all consumers.""It’s surprising that Facebook would leave such a big segment of the market out from an initial standpoint,"" Mandelbaum told IBD. ""They’re not only excluding Apple, but most of the PCs that users own, leaving the vast majority out.""He says his company has been working on algorithms that improve lower-end VR viewing. This could further the use of iPhones for VR in the interim, before Apple comes out with its own headset.""You don't need to have a high-end VR headset to have a premium VR experience, because the software is doing the heavy lifting,"" Mandelbaum said.While its rivals rush into VR, Apple could skip it altogether and instead pursue mixed reality (MR).Munster says there's a camp that believes VR is just the ""appetizer"" to a bigger opportunity with MR, which goes beyond entertainment applications to be integrated within daily life. Munster says home designs could incorporate virtual flowers and pictures, for example. And a display containing the weather forecast could be grabbed and manipulated.That would be more in Apple's wheelhouse, as iPhone applications like the calendar, maps, and photos have become necessities. It could also decide the company's fate.""Over the next 20 years, the screen as we know it will slowly go away,"" Munster said in a Feb. 9 research report. ""Given Apple's business in screens (iPhones, iPads and Macs), Apple needs to have leadership in MR to stay relevant long term.""

244,MAC,"As the Air Force readies 60-year-old B-52 bombers to prosecute the war against the Islamic State, a separate air war is looming over Congress amid opposition to the Pentagon's acquisition strategy for the B-21 bomber, which is supposed to replace the aging aircraft.Six years after an earlier attempt to update the bomber fleet was canceled due to high costs, the Defense Department awarded Northrop Grumman (NOC) the B-21 contract in October. Work was held up by a protest from the losing Boeing (BA)-Lockheed Martin (LMT) team, but the Government Accountability Office rejected it last month.Now the B-21, which could cost $50 billion-$80 billion, is taking flak from lawmakers over the Pentagon's use of a contract that leaves taxpayers on the hook for any cost overruns for the initial phase.“I remain seriously concerned about the acquisition strategy for the B-21 Long Range Strike Bomber, especially the use of a cost-plus contract for the development of this aircraft,” said Sen. John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, at a hearing earlier this month.When asked if he would use the defense authorization bill to block the contract, a McCain spokeswoman said the senator would ""consider his legislative options.""Cost-plus contracts have been used for programs -- like Lockheed's F-22 and F-35 as well as Northrop's B-2 -- that are now known for sky-high price tags. Production on the F-22 and B-2 ended early, due in part to ballooning costs.Despite McCain's concerns, the Air Force is moving ahead with its latest stealth weapon. Lt. Gen. Arnold Bunch, military deputy in Air Force acquisition, said last week that the service decided to use a cost-plus contract for development because of risks associated with building a completely new airframe.The options for the first five production lots, which include 21 aircraft, are fixed price, meaning the contractor absorbs additional costs.But Andrew Hunter, director of the Defense-Industrial Initiatives Group at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said there are also risks with using fixed-price contracts.General Dynamics’ (GD) F-111 attack aircraft, Boeing's C-17 transport aircraft, and Lockheed's C-5 transport plane were all fixed-price contracts that went well over budget, he said. The government then has no choice but to help out the industrial base or risk a ripple of bankruptcies from various suppliers, he added, drawing a comparison to the auto bailout.""Almost without an expectation, the government has had to pay extra,"" Hunter said of planes bought at fixed prices. ""The government has the decision to cancel the program and get nothing, or pay more to actually get the airplane.""Critics of the cost-plus contract point to Boeing's KC-46 refueling tanker, which is under a fixed-price contract. The aerospace giant has assumed over $800 million in after-tax charges on the plane due to higher-than-estimated engineering and manufacturing costs.But the Air Force's Bunch cautioned against comparing the B-21 with the tanker, pointing out that the KC-46 is a derivative of a commercial plane, Boeing's 767, and has potential for foreign sales. The B-21 has no commercial version and no prospects at this time for international sales to allies, he said.And while the B-21 will use mature technology, there are still risks from integrating the technology into a new plane, Bunch added.McCain also has issues with the Air Force not disclosing the full price of the bomber, though it puts the development cost at $23.5 billion and the per-plane cost at $564 million in 2016 dollars.""Why would you not want to tell the American people how you are going to spend their dollars?"" he asked March 8.The Air Force countered by saying it doesn't want enemies inferring the plane's capabilities based on price.But the B-21 isn't so secret that the Air Force can't disclose the identities of top subcontractors, who can help build more political support among lawmakers seeking Pentagon spending for their states and districts.They include United Technologies’ (UTX) Pratt & Whitney, BAE Systems and Rockwell Collins (COL).Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., a member of the Senate’s Appropriations Committee, said last week that he was pleased that the engines would be built at a factory in his home state, and Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., who is a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, echoed his sentiments.McCain's House counterpart, Rep. Mac Thornberry, R-Texas, told reporters earlier this month that he would like to see more mature technology on big-ticket programs, lowering the risk and need for cost-plus contracts. But he didn't voice a stance on the B-21 contract.Air Force Secretary Deborah James said the service will continue to “communicate” with Congress about the contract, as the B-21 “is a capability we need for the country.” The Air Force estimates an initial operational capability in the mid-2020s.While the B-2 is a stealth plane, it still lights up radars on Capitol Hill and in the Pentagon, as it looms over the latest bomber contract. Considered a poster child for Pentagon overspending, only 21 B-2s were built at a cost of more than $2 billion each.But James said she's learned from the B-2's failures, and the Air Force is taking a different approach with the B-21 this time.“The B-2 remained in the shadows for too long,"" she said. ""Too many details remained classified too long.""

245,MAC,"Burger King parent Restaurant Brands International (QSR) received a higher price target and earnings estimate Wednesday amid an upbeat outlook for sales growth and cost savings, though the company still isn’t getting as much love from Wall Street as chief rival McDonald’s (MCD).The higher estimates came a day after Restaurant Brands beat fourth-quarter earnings and revenue estimates, helped by a 6.3% same-store sales gain at its Tim Hortons coffee and doughnuts chain. Burger King comps grew 3.9%.In a note published Wednesday morning, RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer raised his price target on Restaurant Brands to 38 from 36. Palmer also raised his 2016 per-share earnings estimate to $1.36 from $1.30 and his 2017 estimate to $1.60 from $1.53.“While (foreign-exchange) headwinds are likely to persist this year, we expect continued outperformance by Tim Hortons in Canada, slightly positive trends at BK U.S. and Canada, and more robust international growth for BK in 2016,” Palmer said. “Our model also reflects cost savings within the Tim Hortons distribution business, which we believe was a significant source of EPS upside vs. our estimates over the last two quarters.”Restaurant Brands is already one of the more efficient operators in the fast-food sector, Palmer said. He estimates that Restaurant Brands’ capital spending per restaurant this year will average about $7,600. That compares to $11,000 at Taco Bell parent Yum Brands (YUM) and $21,500 at Wendy’s (WEN). McDonald’s has the highest overhead costs of any of the four, Palmer noted, though he didn’t provide 2016 capex estimates for the fast-food chain.Meanwhile, Restaurant Brands’ top line should get a boost from an ever-widening market reach.“International unit growth has been accelerating, (and) the company’s domestic sales momentum seems to have improved in recent months,” Palmer said.Restaurant Brands shares closed up 2% on the stock market today. The stock is up 18% since hitting a three-and-a-half month low of 29.28 on Feb. 11, though it is still down about 24% from its 52-week high of 45.71 set last February.In contrast, McDonald’s set a record high earlier this month and is up about 24% over the last year. Shares have been on a sharp rise since October, when McDonald’s launched its successful all-day breakfast menu.Even so, McDonald’s shares fell 0.45% Wednesday. Yum rose 2.4%, while Wendy’s gained 1%.

246,MAC,"The biggest stock market winners of the past century typically showed strong profit growth for at least three years before beginning their big advances, according to IBD research.Annual earnings growth is so important that it has its own letter -- ""A"" -- in IBD's CAN SLIM investing system acronym.To find the stocks with the potential for the greatest price gains, look for companies with annual profit growth of at least 25% over three to five years. Such companies typically boast new products or services that take market share or create new markets, as Apple (AAPL) did with its iPhones, Mac computers and iPads.Full-year earnings estimates are also key, as they can flag up-and-coming growth companies.“It’s the combination of strong earnings in the last several quarters plus a record of solid growth in the recent years that creates a superb stock, or at least one with a higher probability of success during an uptrending general market,” IBD founder William O’Neil wrote in “How to Make Money in Stocks.”Annual earnings-per-share figures can be found in minicharts throughout IBD, including the IBD 50 and Stock Spotlight. The data can also be found in IBD Stock Checkup at Investors.com.Lately, few companies have been able to post robust EPS growth because of the sluggish economy. As a result, many slower-growing defensive stocks had replaced growth stocks in the IBD 50 earlier this year. They include real estate investment trusts such as CoreSite Realty (COR) and big cap stocks like Ross Stores (ROST), which tend to perform better in slow-growth environments.But pockets of strong growth remain. A select number of IBD 50 stocks with strong annual earnings growth are listed in the accompanying table. They include Facebook (FB), which enjoys three- and five-year earnings and sales growth rates of more than 50%.Of course, not all stocks that meet the A in CAN SLIM will turn into winners. It's also important to consider criteria such as sales growth, return on equity, and profit margins before buying a stock. And in all cases, investors should wait for each stock to form a proper base and clear its buy point in strong volume before buying.Strong profit growth that's accompanied by weak sales growth could be a sign that a company is cutting costs to boost profits. Or, if sales growth exceeds profit growth and margins are shrinking, it may mean the company’s costs are too high or its products are facing tough competition.

249,MAC,"Democrats across the U.S. are ""feeling the Bern,"" but solar ETF investors likely find little humor in the slogan.They're feeling the burn more intensely than ever, as First Solar (FSLR) stock has tanked since the industry heavyweight recently shied away from 2017 forecasts, citing lack of clarity about next year. SunEdison (SUNE) is now a penny stock, with shares crashing since July after a botched attempt to acquire installer Vivint Solar (VSLR).To make matters worse, Chinese firms JA Solar (JASO), Jinko Solar (JKS) and Trina Solar (TSL) continue to build capacity. That is likely to force a solar panel glut in 2016, all the more so since demand in Japan and the U.K. is expected to hit a wall as key subsidies are slashed, some analysts suggest.Still, there's undeniable optimism about solar stocks for the long term.Investors pumped a net $3.8 million into Guggenheim Solar (TAN) in March -- despite SunEdison bankruptcy rumors that singed peers such as Solar City (SCTY), Sunrun (RUN) and Vivint.""Alternative energy sources represent the future,"" said Will McGough, portfolio manager at Stadion, a $3.7 billion money manager in Georgia.Hedge-fund stock picks like First Solar have cast a glow on broadly diversified solar-focused exchange traded funds, he said.TAN invests in 23 stocks, offering one-click exposure to the global solar market. It invests up and down the value chain -- from raw material suppliers to manufacturers to installers. It gives a higher weighting to ""pure play"" solar companies. First Solar is its No. 1 stock holding.The $228.31 million ETF slumped 54% in the past year. It peaked at $50 in April but fell sharply soon after. Despite booting out troubled Chinese stock Hanergy Thin Film in June, TAN hasn't recovered.Solar stocks continue to wilt under the glare of stalling growth in China. Lower oil and gas prices make nontraditional sources of energy less attractive too. A judicial challenge against the federal Clean Power Plan hasn't helped matters.SunEdison was dropped from TAN's underlying index on March 22, as its liquidity crunch made news. The ETF rebalances quarterly, but can rejigger holdings more frequently in unusual circumstances, such as delistings or bankruptcies.Richard Asplund, research director of MAC Solar Index, index provider for TAN, sees several bullish factors for solar stocks, including:""Despite the recent weakness in solar stock prices, the global solar industry itself continues to show strength,"" Asplund said in a statement.However, investors remain skeptical about solar for now. An IBD Accumulation/Distribution rating of D- points to poor demand for TAN shares among institutional investors. The smaller Market Vectors Solar Energy (KWT) is at high risk for closure, according to ETF.com.Stadion manager McGough, for one, isn't about to plunge into solar ETFs.""Solar ETFs are in a longer-term downward move with volatility increasing,"" McGough told IBD in a phone call. Stadion's tactical asset allocation looks at price trends and Sharpe ratios (a measure of risk-adjusted returns) to decide which investments are in or out of favor.TAN has given up 27% year to date through April 8 vs. a 0.8% gain for SPDR S&P 500 (SPY). Over the past three years, it has outperformed SPY, a proxy for the broad U.S. market, while showing far more volatility.""TAN is best suited for a tactical investment objective, or one that is bought and held over the long term for an investor who is comfortable with the higher risk profile associated with solar equities,” William Belden, Guggenheim managing director, said in an e-mail.The solar industry group has been losing momentum for the past three months. It now ranks No. 164 out of 197 industry groups tracked by IBD vs. No. 31 just 13 weeks ago.

250,MAC,"Hackers targeted Apple (AAPL) Macintosh users over the weekend in what No. 2 cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks (PANW) believes was the first successful ransomware scheme on the OS X platform.Ransomware attacks have targeted Microsoft (MSFT) Windows computers, encrypting data on infected machines and then demanding a ransom from users for the digital key to the locked files. Palo Alto dubbed the Apple ransomware ""KeRanger.""KeRanger was burrowed into two installers of Transmission 2.90, an open-source BitTorrent software used to transmit peer-to-peer data, according to a Palo Alto Networks blog post Sunday.Because KeRanger was signed with a valid Mac application development certificate, it was able to bypass Apple's Gatekeeper systems, Palo Alto said. KeRanger sleeps for three days before locking files, which means infections will likely become evident Monday.""After completing the encryption process, KeRanger demands that victims pay one bitcoin (about $400) to a specific address to retrieve their files,"" according to the post.KeRanger also infected Time Machine backup files to prevent victims from recovering previously protected data.Palo Alto Networks says it alerted Apple and Transmission on Friday and has since updated its URL-filtering and threat-prevention processes to block KeRanger installs.Transmission has since removed the malicious installers from its website and released version 2.92. Apple revoked the abused certificate and updated its XProtect antivirus signature, Palo Alto Networks said.Apple confirmed in an email to IBD that it has pulled the developer certificate and updated XProject so that no one can install the infected app.Transmission representatives told Forbes that about 6,500 machines were infected. Transmission removed the infected version about 32 hours after Palo Alto notified the site of the breach, Ryan Olson, head of Palo Alto Networks' threat intelligence unit, told IBD.According to Palo Alto Networks, the only previous ransomware developed to hit Macs was discovered in 2014. Then, security firm Kaspersky Lab found an incomplete hack named FileCoder.""We believe KeRanger is the first fully functional ransomware seen on the OS X platform,"" Palo Alto said.Ransomware attacks are booming as cybercrooks shift from bank information theft -- a model fraught with risk -- to easier and less traceable scams, Olson said. And the attacks are indiscriminate, targeting grandma and her home computer as often as businesses with operations-critical files.“It’s a broad spectrum,” he said. “They’re going to monetize every infection they can using this technique.”Apple stock fell 1.1% on the stock market today, while Palo Alto Networks stock rose 2.3%.

Apple stock was down almost 5% to near 95 in midday trading on the stock market today. It closed the regular session Tuesday at 99.99, up 0.6%. At least eight bullish analysts cut their price targets…

254,MAC,"Apple (AAPL) missed Wall Street’s December-quarter sales targets for iPhones, iPads and Mac computers, so it tried to focus attention on its robust services business.Apple stock was down 6%, near 94, in late-afternoon trading on the stock market today as investors reacted to the company’s fiscal-first-quarter results and Q2 guidance announced late Tuesday. At least nine analysts cut their price targets on Apple stock following the earnings release.In the quarter ended Dec. 26, Apple earned $3.28 a share, up 7.2% year over year, on sales of $75.87 billion, up 1.7%. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected Apple to earn $3.23 a share on sales of $76.54 billion.For the current quarter, Apple’s fiscal Q2, the Cupertino, Calif.-based company expects sales of $50 billion to $53 billion. The midpoint of its sales guidance would represent an 11.2% year-over-year drop in revenue. Wall Street had been modeling for Q2 sales of $55.48 billion. Apple, though, is known for giving cautious guidance.Here are five key takeaways from the Apple report:With sales of iPhones, iPads and Mac computers losing steam, Apple executives late Tuesday attempted to divert attention to the company's fast-growing services business.On the earnings conference call with analysts, Apple CEO Tim Cook said the company recently crossed a major milestone of having 1 billion devices in use. That’s up 25% year over year, he said.The fast-growing installed base of devices has fueled Apple’s services business, which include the App Store, iTunes Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay and AppleCare.Apple generated $6.06 billion in service revenue in Q1, up 26% from the year-earlier period. That sum included $548 million received from Samsung as part of a patent infringement dispute.Excluding the patent award, Apple’s services revenue was up 15% to $5.5 billion, thanks in part to strong growth in app sales, Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said on the call.UBS analyst Steven Milunovich wondered if Apple emphasizing its services business is a good or bad thing.“The investor concern is that companies like Xerox (XRX) and semi-cap names start talking about services as they are going ex-growth,” Milunovich said in a research report Wednesday.RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani echoed those concerns.“The fear is: Is Apple showing (its) services/recurring revenue stream because iPhone units have peaked and market is saturated?” he said in a report Tuesday.Apple presented a “sobering” view of the global economic climate in its quarterly report, Mizuho Securities analyst Abhey Lamba said in a report Wednesday.“Apple’s commentary about the macro (economic picture) will likely have an impact on the entire technology space,” Lamba said. “As such, we expect cautious outlook from most of the companies as they report over the next few weeks.”Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster said Apple’s tone spooked investors.“While we were expecting some level of cautious macro commentary given the volatility in global stock markets, decline of commodity prices and uncertainty in the Chinese economy, the level of caution described by Apple was greater than we would have expected,” Munster said in a note Tuesday. “In our review of the earnings call transcript, we noted cautious macro commentary nine times in the prepared remarks and four cautious comments in the Q&A. This compares to one cautious macro related comment in the September-quarter call in October.”Cook said Apple’s results were impressive given the global macroeconomic environment.“We’re seeing extreme conditions, unlike anything we’ve experienced before, just about everywhere we look,” Cook said. “Major markets including Brazil, Russia, Japan, Canada, Southeast Asia, Australia, Turkey and the eurozone have been impacted by slowing economic growth, falling commodity prices and weakening currencies.”Even Greater China, which had been holding up for Apple, started showing of economic softness this month, most notably in Hong Kong, Cook said.Apple’s December quarter sales would have been up 8% year over year if not for the impact of foreign-exchange rates. Apple generates 66% of its revenue outside the U.S., and so foreign-currency fluctuations have a meaningful impact on its business.To illustrate, Cook said $100 of Apple’s non-U.S. dollar revenue in Q4 of 2014 translated to only $85 last quarter due to the weakening currencies in international markets.“Since the end of fiscal 2014, for instance, the euro and British pound are down double-digits, and major currencies such as the Canadian dollar, Australian dollar, Mexican peso and Turkish lira have declined 20% or more. The Brazilian real is down more than 40% and the Russian ruble has declined more than 50%,” Cook said.Apple managed to eke out growth in its iPhone business in the December quarter, but just barely. It sold 74.78 million iPhones in Q1, up 0.4% from the same quarter a year earlier.But even Cook admits that iPhone sales will fall in the current quarter. That would mark a first for the iconic product, introduced in 2007.Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi said Apple’s Q2 guidance seemed to indicate a 15%-20% unit decline in iPhones. He asked Cook on the conference call about his estimate.“We do think that iPhone units will decline in the quarter,” Cook responded. “We don’t think that they will decline to the levels that you’re talking about.”Still, other analysts agreed with Sacconaghi on the scale of the iPhone unit decline in Q2.Pacific Crest Securities analyst Andy Hargreaves said he expects iPhone unit sales to decline 20% year over year in Q2, but that will likely be the low point of the cycle.Credit Suisse analyst Kulbinder Garcha is projecting sales of 45.6 million iPhones in the March quarter for a 25% year-over-year decline.FBN Securities analyst Shebly Seyrafi expects Apple will sell about 48 million iPhones in the March quarter. Before Apple’s latest report, Wall Street analysts on average were modeling for 55 million units, he said.Apple is rumored to be developing virtual reality or augmented reality technology for future products.One analyst asked Cook what he thought of virtual reality technology in general.“I don’t think it’s a niche,” Cook said. “It’s really cool and has some interesting applications.”Apple recently hired Doug Bowman, previously the director of the Center for Human-Computer Interaction at Virginia Tech. Bowman joins a growing team of virtual and augmented reality experts at Apple, following the company’s acquisitions of Faceshift, Metaio and Emotient, the Verge reported.In their post-earnings reports, a number of analysts said the lack of a new growth driver will weigh on Apple stock.Apple stock is likely to be “range-bound” in the near term because of “limited catalysts” to get investors interested, Deutsche Bank analyst Sherri Scribner said in a report Wednesday.With uninspiring sales of the Apple Watch so far, “investors could legitimately start to question innovation” at Apple, Cowen analyst Timothy Arcuri said in a note Wednesday.Arcuri rates Apple stock as market perform, with a price target of 125.In addition to the innovation concern, Arcuri is worried about slowing growth in China and whether the iPhone 7, expected this fall, will be a compelling handset.“What we know about iPhone 7 is evolutionary, not revolutionary,” he said. An OLED screen could be the next big innovation for the iPhone, but that’s not going to happen until 2018, he said.

255,MAC,"John McGraw wasn’t just old school when it came to baseball.He was one of the school's founding fathers.Another legendary manager, Connie Mack, said of his rival, “There has been only one manager -- and his name is McGraw.”Charles Alexander, a history professor who wrote the 1995 book “John McGraw,” said the skipper was “perhaps the single most significant figure in baseball’s history before Babe Ruth,” and that he “epitomized what a baseball manager was supposed to be.”As a player and manager, McGraw (1873-1934) was shrewd, scrappy, fiery, demanding of himself and others, and single-minded in purpose:“Personally I could never see this idea of taking defeat philosophically,” McGraw said, as quoted in the newly published “Stealing Games: How John McGraw Transformed Baseball With the 1911 New York Giants” by Maury Klein. “I hate to lose, and I never feel myself beaten until the last man is out. I have tried to instill that same fighting spirit in all the teams I have managed.”In 33 years as a major league skipper -- 31 of those with the Giants -- McGraw won 2,763 regular season games, still second-most of all time. His winning percentage was a lofty .586, third-highest for skippers who’ve managed over 2,000 games. McGraw led his Giants to three World Series triumphs and 10 National League pennants. He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1937.In 2013, the Sporting News ranked McGraw the second-greatest baseball manager, behind only Joe McCarthy.“McGraw’s baseball intelligence -- his judgment of players, his ability to make the right move at just the right time, his insistence that his men follow his dictates … became legendary,” Alexander said.McGraw said: “The science of managing … is in picking the spots for attack. The idea that any field manager can outline a plan of attack against an entire team is erroneous … impossible. … The baseball manager quickly discovers the weak spots in the (opponent’s) lineup. … The trick is in waiting for the exact moment to spring something that will double-cross the particular player and throw the opposition off balance.”“That was Mac all the time, all our years,” said Hall of Famer Hughie Jennings, a McGraw teammate who then coached under him. “What was worth doing was worth doing well. That was the secret of his preparation. That’s been the secret of his success.”As a player standing just 5 feet 7, McGraw had drive that helped him steer through a big-league career that included a robust .334 lifetime batting average and 436 stolen bases. He was one of baseball’s first stars.Off the field, Hall of Fame umpire Bill Klem, who battled with McGraw during games, spoke glowingly of the skipper’s character: “He helped his friends. … His charity knew neither restraint nor publicity. … It was McGraw’s insistence that his players were just as good as he was that got decent hotel and train accommodations for ballplayers. McGraw ... tried to get (black players) into the big leagues.”Born in Truxton, in the middle of New York state, McGraw was the oldest of eight children. His father was an Irish immigrant and Civil War veteran. McGraw’s mother died during the diphtheria epidemic of 1884-85 that ravaged their region. Four siblings succumbed too.Baseball became young John’s salvation and primary interest of study. He carried his baseball mitt everywhere, to the point a resident recalled it as the boy's appendage.Klein told IBD that McGraw played baseball with his classmates on school grounds and other venues, and a broken window often resulted from a rocket off his bat, costing his dad money: “Father and son argued constantly over his time wasted on the game and the money it drained from the family’s meager resources. But John would not let go of the game he had come to love.”Another broken window in the autumn of 1885 led to a fatherly beating, and John ran away from home. A neighbor, Mary Goddard, who had a small hotel, took him.John took on chores for Goddard, went to school, had a variety of jobs and earned money to “feed his love of baseball,” Klein wrote. He purchased baseball guides and memorized the rules of the game. By age 16, he was the standout player on his school team.“Along the way, he learned that no one else would look out for him, and that he had to make his own way in life,” Klein wrote.Baseball offered escape from the humdrum life of a routine job in a small town, provided he could beat the odds and fierce competition to play on the pro level.McGraw refined his game; he shorten his swing and placed hits. He became an expert base runner. “He used his knowledge of the latest rules to figure out how to take advantage of them before many players even knew they existed,” Klein wrote.After playing in the minors, McGraw reached the big leagues with the Baltimore Orioles, then of the American Association, in 1891. He played mostly third base and was a leader of manufacturing runs during the Dead Ball Era. His bat control helped introduce the hit-and-run and squeeze plays.After being a player-manager for 2-1/2 seasons for the Orioles, who by then were flipping from the NL to the American League, McGraw jumped in midseason 1902 to the Giants. The team had not enjoyed a winning season in four years, and the environment was toxic.“More than the mere lack of skill had the Giants in last place,” said McGraw’s wife, Blanche. “Key players simply were not interested in anything except their salary checks.”McGraw really put his stamp on the team in 1903. He brought in new players, laid down the law and instituted his aggressive running style.He “took to the business of baseball with utmost seriousness and expected his players to do the same,” Klein said. “McGraw liked smart players who picked things up quickly and never had to be told something twice.”The manager expected a lot from his players, but also from himself: “I have made it a point … never to blame a player for failing in a sincere effort to carry out instructions from the bench, but I also have made it a point to censure a player, even if he won the game, by failing to obey orders.”“What a great man he was!” said John ""Chief"" Meyers, a Giants catcher. “Oh, we held him in high esteem. We respect him in every way. According to Mr. McGraw, his ball team never lost a game; he lost it, not his players. He fought for his players and protected them.”To that point, McGraw was thrown out of a 131 games for arguing with umpires, since surpassed by another Hall of Famer, Bobby Cox.In his first full season of 1903 in New York, McGraw posted a 84-55 record. In 1904 the team went 106-47 and won the NL pennant but chose not to participate in the new event that was the World Series. The 1905 season saw the Giants go 105-48, collect another pennant, then best Connie Mack’s Philadelphia Athletics in the World Series, 4 games to 1.Legendary Giants pitcher Christy Mathewson, who threw three shutouts in that 1905 Series, lauded the skipper under whom he thrived: ""The club is McGraw.”For all his skills, McGraw said his greatest managerial asset was that he “knew and remembered the weakness and strength of nearly every player in the big league. … I never doped out any system of remembering things. I guess it is due to my intense concentration on anything in what I am interested.”Managed the New York Giants to three World Series triumphs and was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1937.Overcame: Turning around the toxic culture of a losing New York franchise.Lesson: Bring people up to your standards, and never compromise on those.“All successful endeavors in life are based on that idea of being able to find faults and of being just as quick to correct them.”“The man who loses gracefully loses easily.”“Namby-pamby methods don’t get much in results.”""In playing or managing, the game of ball is only fun for me when I'm out in front and winning.”

256,MAC,"As Apple (AAPL) turns 40 on Friday, some observers say the tech behemoth might be tempted to go the way of the stereotypical middle-aged man and get a sports car (the rumored Apple car?) and a young girlfriend (acquire a hip new company?).The Cupertino, Calif.-based company has seen a lot of changes over the years as it fueled the PC revolution; survived a near bankruptcy; reinvented how music is distributed and enjoyed; launched the smartphone era; and created the tablet market.Now people wonder what’s ahead for the storied personal technology company.Apple CEO Tim Cook acknowledged the milestone at the company’s spring product launch event on March 21. But he said Apple doesn’t spend much time reflecting on past accomplishments. Cook introduced a short video (“Apple – 40 Years in 40 Seconds”) and then moved on to the news of the day, which included the 4-inch iPhone SE and a 9.7-inch iPad Pro.More than four years after the death of the company’s iconic co-founder and leader Steve Jobs, the big question is whether Apple can continue to innovate.New product categories launched under Cook’s leadership include the Apple Watch and Apple Music. Cook also oversaw the $3 billion acquisition of Beats Electronics, which got Apple into premium headphones and streaming music, in August 2014.Under Cook, Apple has become largely a smartphone company, with the iPhone driving 68% of revenue in its fiscal first quarter ended Dec. 26.For the near term, Apple will continue to use the iPhone to grow its sales. It still sees growth opportunities in emerging markets like China and India, and it wants to attract more switchers from the Android smartphone camp.“There’s an urgency now at Apple to continue growing the iPhone market,” Tim Bajarin, an analyst with Creative Strategies, told IBD.Apple’s new low-cost iPhone SE, which starts at $399, is a move toward getting more price-conscious consumers, he said.But iPhone sales have been slowing in recent quarters. The company is expected to post its first ever decline in iPhone unit sales on a year-over-year basis in its fiscal Q2 report on April 25.Meanwhile, Apple’s iPad tablet sales have fallen for eight straight quarters on a year-over-year basis. And the company’s once-core Mac computer business is a slow-growth, mature business for Apple.At the same time, other big tech companies are capturing the imagination of consumers and Wall Street with bold initiatives. Facebook (FB) is leading the charge in virtual reality headsets with Oculus Rift. Amazon.com (AMZN) is touting its well-received Echo smart speaker with the Alexa personal assistant AI. And even once-stodgy Microsoft (MSFT) has earned plaudits for its HoloLens holographic computing platform and augmented reality glasses.So what’s the next big thing for Apple?It certainly has the resources to make big bets on new technology. Apple had $215 billion in cash and securities as of the end of last year.Sticking with the middle-aged male metaphor, these are the prime earnings years for Apple. It’s cash-rich and its main businesses continue to generate significant profits. But it doesn’t have the youthful vigor it once did.If the balding, slightly pudgy Apple were to buy a sports car to spice up its life, what would it be?It could be an actual car. Apple has been rumored for some time to be working on an electric car to rival those built by Tesla Motors (TSLA). It’s known to have been hiring automotive engineers, including staff from Tesla. And it also has been creating such a racket at a reported car-testing facility in Sunnyvale, Calif., that the neighbors have complained about the noise.Bajarin, though, doubts that Apple will come out with an actual car. He theorizes that Apple is working on technologies for smart cars, something it began pursuing with its CarPlay software. It would license the technologies to automakers.“I’m in the camp that says Apple will do stuff that will revolutionize the driving experience, as opposed to creating their own car,” Bajarin said.Bajarin says Apple’s next big thing will be its own virtual reality headset. The company has made some high-profile hires in the VR and augmented reality sector. Apple is likely to come out with a VR headset within 24 months, he says.“VR is a game-changer,” he said. “I don’t see how they can stay out of that market.”Apple would be attracted by the huge potential market size and the consumer focus for the technology, he said.Apple keeps a project roadmap for the next five to seven years, Bajarin said. It takes two to three years to go from designing a product to bringing it to market, he said.Apple doesn’t thrill people with new products like it used to, Roger Kay, an analyst with Endpoint Technologies Associates, told IBD. You don’t see as many people camping out to buy the latest new Apple gadget.“Sleeping in front of stores . . . there’s a lot less of that,” he said. “So from the excitement point of view, that’s gone away for them.”Continuing with the metaphor of Apple as a middle-aged man, if the company stuck with the stereotype it might try dating a much younger lady to feel young again.That could take the shape of an acquisition of a hot new company like Tesla. Others have suggested that Apple could buy GoPro (GPRO) or even a movie studio.But Apple executives have been loath to do large acquisitions. They prefer smaller deals to acquire technology and engineering talent that it can tuck into current projects. They also don’t want to dilute the corporate culture they have nurtured so meticulously.Apple has taken notice of disaster-after-disaster of tech companies trying to do big mergers and acquisitions, and they decided that wasn’t right for them, Kay said.Apple’s new girlfriend might already be on its doorstep, not an acquisition but its fabulous new “spaceship campus” headquarters now under construction a few miles from its current headquarters. The $5 billion project will look like a flying saucer landed in leafy-green park.Some might see it as a vanity project, but it could actually spark innovative thinking among the workers there, Kay says. Plus, the building should help Apple maintain its “super cool, premium brand,” he said.Gartner analyst Brian Blau said Apple is going to be around for a long time, making products that consumers crave.“Apple will be relevant and influential for years to come,” Blau told IBD. “It’s clear that people like Apple technology and the Apple brand.”Apple, he says, has a great track record for product development -- and it would be foolish to bet against it.

257,MAC,"At least three Wall Street analysts cut their price targets on GameStop (GME) stock on Monday, following the video game retailer’s fiscal fourth-quarter earnings and guidance.Late Thursday, GameStop delivered mixed Q4 results and current-year guidance. The Grapevine, Texas-based company also acknowledged for the first time that physical video game sales are in permanent decline.Pacific Crest Securities analyst Evan Wilson said it took several years for GameStop to admit what most industry observers already knew -- that digital game downloads were cannibalizing physical game software sales. GameStop executives said diversification is now the company’s main strategy.GameStop is increasing its specialty stores that sell AT&T (T) and Apple (AAPL) products as well as outlets that sell pop-culture collectibles based on “Star Wars,” Marvel superheroes, ""Game of Thrones"" and other creative properties.Wilson reiterated his sector-weight rating on GameStop stock.“We remain skeptical on the collectibles business and AT&T reseller stores,” Wilson said in a research report Thursday. “These can all be fine businesses, even with better margins than the core. However, they just cannot be big enough to replace games and justify GameStop’s current market capitalization, in our view. We continue to expect it to spin its tires diversifying away from games and to underestimate the pace of negative change in the game business.”Benchmark analyst Mike Hickey on Monday reiterated his sell rating on GameStop stock and lowered his price target to 26.33 from 27.36.GameStop was down a fraction, near 30, in afternoon trading on the stock market today.Hickey knocked the company's efforts to to grow sales through mobile devices and pop-culture collectables.“We remain largely unimpressed by the company’s transformation to a mobile distributor/T-shirt, bento box, waffle maker retailer,” Hickey said in a report.GameStop has an “outmoded” business model built around sales of game hardware and software using traditional retail stores, he said. Hickey says console software sales will turn completely digital within the next five years.For its fiscal fourth quarter ended Jan. 30, GameStop earned $2.40 a share, excluding items, on sales of $3.53 billion. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected $2.25 a share on sales of $3.56 billion. On a year-over-year basis, GameStop EPS ex items rose 12%, but sales ticked up just 1%.Game hardware and software accounted for nearly 87% of sales in fiscal Q4. Sales of game products dropped 3.1% to $3.05 billion in Q4.Mobile and consumer electronics sales rose 16.9% to $209 million, accounting for 5.9% of Q4 revenue. Top sellers included the Apple iPhone 6S, the Apple Watch and Beats headphones.GameStop added 552 new technology brand stores last year and ended the period with 1,036 stores, including the Simply Mac and Spring Mobile chains.Sales of collectibles and other products rose 77% to $266 million, making up 7.6% of revenue. It ended the fiscal year with 35 collectibles stores worldwide, including ThinkGeek outlets.Piper Jaffray analyst Michael Olson maintained his overweight rating on GameStop stock, but cut his price target to 41 from 42. He noted that the company’s guidance for Q1 and fiscal 2016 was below consensus estimates.Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter reiterated his outperform rating on GameStop stock, but cut his price target to 36 from 38. He took a more cautious stance as the company increases its mobile phone retail business.“GameStop is a quality retailer, has a shareholder-friendly capital allocation strategy, and has prudently managed the transition from a games-only retailer to a multi-channel retailer of games, mobile hardware and services and collectibles,” he said in a research report Monday. “We expect GameStop’s core business to continue to contract, and expect its mobile and loot businesses to continue to grow.”

258,MAC,"Apple will revamp its iPhone lineup in 2017, according to a new note by Ming-Chi Kuo at KGI Securities, according to various reports.The 2017 smartphone will have a curved glass body, similar to the iPhone 4/4s ""flat sandwich"" design, Kuo said, AppleInsider reported.  But instead of flat glass it will likely have curved glass front and back. The 5.8"" iPhone -- presumably the iPhone 8 -- will use AMOLED displays. While there have been widespread rumors that Apple would turn to OLED displays, Kuo had previously predicted that they wouldn't be used until after 2017.Organic light emitting diode displays are thinner and more power-efficient than liquid crystal displays. They also have higher color saturation and are more flexible than LCDs. Samsung, Motorola, LG, the Alphabet (GOOGL) Google Nexus and the upcoming HP Inc. (HPQ) HP Elite x3.The 2017 iPhone also will use some form of wireless charging, 9To5 Mac said, citing Kuo's note. It will also have some new biometric features, possibly facial or eye recognition.The 5.8-inch phone could replace the current 5.5"" size entirely if there is sufficient OLED supply, Kuo said. If not, it could be a new high-end model on top of the 5.5"" design. Apple also will have a 4.7-inch model in either case.The iPhone 7 due out later this year may not be radically different from the iPhone 6/6s, aside from being thinner and having no headphone port.

259,MAC,"While the drop in February's sales of existing homes in the U.S. took many by surprise this week, maybe it shouldn't have. Among renters in America, 7 in 10 see renting as more affordable than homeowning, according to the results of a new Harris Poll -- an opinion held even by many of those who hope or expect to buy in the next few years.While the results are consistent with four previous Harris Polls of renters' attitudes, conducted quarterly for Freddie Mac (FMCC) since August 2014, what's new is that more renters -- 39% -- said that they're struggling with debt, up from 34% three months before.That's especially the case among Generation X -- defined by the survey as 35- to 49-year-olds -- 54% of whom complain of living payday to payday. Only 41% had said that in the previous survey.In recent history, about two-thirds of Americans have owned homes by age 40, but homeownership has been declining for a decade. The share of renter households in the U.S. rose to a 20-year high of 35.5% in 2014, according to a recent Harvard University study, as their numbers grew by an annual average of 770,000 since 2004. And many of those who are considered of prime homeowning age -- 45- to 64-year-olds -- made up twice as many of those households as those under 35.In the results of the new Harris Poll, conducted from Jan. 26 to Feb. 1, not making enough money (46%) and not being able to afford a down payment (46%) continue to be cited as the leading financial reasons for not owning a home -- for all renters who said they expect to still be renting in three years. But that's down from October 2015's numbers, when 54% felt they lacked the cash, and 49% didn't expect to be able to make a down payment.However, 24% said renting ""allows me to save money"" -- an answer that was available to the poll's respondents for the first time.Meanwhile, anxieties about debt, employment, lack of mobility and the current housing market seems to have edged down. In October, 22% felt constrained from homebuying by ""lack of job stability,"" but that fell to 19% this year. In perhaps another indication of less uncertainty about the future, the need for ""flexibility/mobility"" in the short run was expressed by 14%, compared to 18% previously.And the least-chosen reason given by those renters who expected to be renting in three years -- ""buying a home in the current market is not a good investment"" -- was picked by even fewer this year, 11%. In October it was 16%.Related:More Commercial Investors Home In On Multifamily Sector, Study Says2015 Saw Most Home Flippers In U.S. Since 2007, RealtyTrac Says5 Affordable Markets For First-Time Homebuyers.Image provided by Shutterstock.com.

260,MAC,"Campaign 2016: The presidential contest that got off to such an auspicious start with last month's first GOP debate in Cleveland got even more interesting with Wednesday's vibrant exchanges in Southern California.It should be apparent to the millions who tuned in that Republicans have indeed fielded an A-Team, as member Mike Huckabee described it, and most brought their A-games to the Reagan Library. The notable exception was the race's front-runner, but whose lead probably emerged intact.From Marco Rubio's firm grasp of foreign affairs to the re-energized repartees of Jeb Bush on matters personal and professional, from Chris Christie's full-throated demonstration of why he's succeeded in a dark-blue New Jersey to Carly Fiorina's razor-sharp responses on, well, you name it — we saw an outstanding display of principled and well-articulated views.The evening's main theme, as perhaps intended by host CNN, was foreign policy, and participants came prepared. Particularly impressive was Rubio's calm precision and depth in cataloging the many ways that Barack Obama's leadership vacuum has created opportunities for Islamic radicals, Putin and China.A heartening and well-deserved defense of George W. Bush's effort to protect the country from terrorism came from not only his brother, Jeb, but also from Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, Christie and even Dr. Ben Carson, who called the former president ""a great friend of ours.""The strength of the GOP field served to highlight a serious weakness of Donald Trump. While Rubio, Bush, Fiorina and the others explained the current dangers in the world in impressive detail, Trump fumbled.When asked who the advisors on his ""outstanding"" foreign policy team would be, Trump dodged the question.Even on his single issue, immigration, Trump had trouble explaining his policies. He seemed unprepared, for example, to answer an obvious question about the constitutionality of birthright citizenship, deferring to Rand Paul to explain the legal landscape.Also, when asked about Social Security, Trump had nothing to say about this or other federal entitlements, except that he'd give back his Social Security checks.Trump keeps talking about how he's not a politician. Well, proposing credible solutions to the politically thorny entitlement crisis would be one way to prove it.If Trump wants to be taken seriously as a candidate, he can't just keep winging it, or relying on bluster and name-calling to carry the day.If there was one disappointment, it was the lack of discussion about the Obama economy, and how Obama's oppressive mix of higher taxes and massive new regulations choked off what should have been a fast and furious recovery after the Great Recession.When asked specifically about jobs, Fiorina and Trump attacked each other's business records, rather than speak about creating opportunity and growth.Bush brought up the increase in poverty, and Christie talked about people worried about jobs.Fair enough. But they need to start making the case for a radical departure from Obamanomics now.As it stands, the Democrats continue to hammer away at their message that we ""can't go back"" to failed Bush policies. And those attacks keep going unanswered.The truth is, as we've noted before, President Bush walked into office following the worst stock market crash since the Great Depression and with the Clinton economy already heading into a recession.For six years, Bush warned repeatedly about the dangers of letting Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac grow to gargantuan size. But Democrats refused to listen or act.And that was the real cause of the meltdown.Since then, Obamanomics has led to stagnant incomes, rising poverty, increased taxes, high unemployment and the slowest recovery since the Depression.There will be four more debates. We would hope that economics would be a major focus. We'd like to see, for instance, Trump's long-awaited ""tax plan.""And we'd like to hear, in detail, the other candidates' ideas about tax reform, regulation, immigration, the rule of law and other things vital to a healthy economy.When they do, we think Americans will agree that the GOP this time around is providing a choice, not an echo.

261,MAC,"Head Hunting: Just when you thought the Obama regime's demonization of Wall Street had run its course, Attorney General Loretta Lynch has given prosecutors license to gun for top executives for ""financial crimes.""Lynch has issued a memo to prosecutors nationwide directing them to set their sights on Wall Street bank honchos. Forget corporate liability, forget settlements. The new Justice Department target is ""individuals."" And the new metric of prosecutorial success is jail time, not fines.Lynch was supposed to be kinder and gentler than her predecessor Eric Holder. But the former top New York prosecutor wants CEOs cuffed and frog-marched out of the boardroom.Starting this month, prosecutors are instructed to leverage all their resources to compel corporations under investigation to ID ""high-level executives"" for criminal misconduct. If they don't name names, settlement deals will be taken off the table.In fact, ""the settlement agreement should include a provision that requires the company to provide information about all culpable individuals and that is explicit enough so that a failure to provide the information results in specific consequences, such as stipulated penalties and/or material breach,"" states the seven-page memo, written by Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates.""This condition of cooperation applies equally to corporations seeking to cooperate in civil matters,"" the memo adds. ""A company under civil investigation must provide to the department all relevant facts about individual misconduct in order to receive any consideration in the negotiation.""As Yates recently warned: ""We mean it when we say, 'You have got to cough up the individuals.'""No longer will the government let bankers off the hook for the kind of ""financial fraud"" witnessed during the financial crisis. ""We seek greater accountability from those who use corporations to lie, cheat and steal.""Great, she can start with Jon Corzine, former Democratic governor of New Jersey, who oversaw the collapse of commodity brokerage firm MF Global, then got caught up in the ensuing scandal over improper money transfers from customers' accounts.Once he's behind bars, she can move on to Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who as HUD chief shook down Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac for billions in subprime loans, forcing the mortgage giants to invest their portfolios in high-risk mortgages that sped their collapse and helped crash the entire real estate market.Prosecutors can also target William Apgar, the HUD official behind the disastrous decision allowing Fannie and Freddie to count subprime securities as credit against the agency's ""affordable housing"" targets.Apgar now admits ""it was a mistake.""Only he's never been held accountable for his subprime crimes, either.

269,MAC,"You probably won't need to hold onto your socks during Apple's (AAPL) spring product launch event on Monday. That's the message from Wall Street analysts trying to set realistic expectations for what's likely to be announced.The tech press has been reporting for weeks that Apple will unveil a new 4-inch iPhone, a new 9.7-inch iPad and new Apple Watch bands at the media event Monday at Apple's headquarters in Cupertino, Calif.“While we expect to see several ‘under the hood’ improvements across devices, we are not expecting the same exuberance as last year when Apple shared final details of the Apple Watch,” Oppenheimer analyst Andrew Uerkwitz said in a report Friday. “Moreover, we worry investors will find the next several Apple media events underwhelming.”Uerkwitz rates Apple stock as outperform with a 12- to 18-month price target of 120. Apple shares rose 12 cents to 105.92 on the stock market Friday.Apple has a bunch of innovations in the works for release in 2017 and 2018, he said. They include possibly an iPhone with an OLED display, a virtual reality headset, 360-degree camera, and a hub for smart-home products using Siri, Uerkwitz said.Any surprises at Monday's event likely will revolve around pricing for the new products and possibly the Apple Watch or the introduction of new MacBook or Mac Pro computers.Apple CEO Tim Cook also is likely to use the event as a platform to reinforce the company's argument that the federal government has overstepped its legal bounds by demanding Apple hack its iPhone security. Apple and the Justice Department are set to square off in a federal court on Tuesday in a criminal case where the FBI wants Apple to develop software to bypass its password security measures.Because Apple gets most of its revenue from the iPhone (68% of sales in the December quarter), most of the attention Monday will be focused on the rumored iPhone SE. The new 4-inch iPhone will replace the same-size iPhone 5S, which was introduced in September 2013 and is still on sale.The new model is expected to sport an A9 chip, NFC technology to enable Apple Pay and a 12-megapixel, rear-facing camera to bring it up to snuff with the other iPhones. But it reportedly won't have a pressure-sensitive screen like the premium models, the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus, which have 4.7- and 5.5-inch displays, respectively. The SE will be targeted to customers who prefer a smaller size handset as well as emerging markets because of its expected lower price.The iPhone SE “is likely to be a low-volume (for Apple) product that has minimal effect” on its earnings and stock price, Pacific Crest Securities analyst Andy Hargreaves said in a note Thursday.Hargreaves is bullish on Apple with a price target of 127 because of likely growth in the iPhone 7 cycle starting this fall.“Investors are not excited about this new phone,” Rosenblatt Securities analyst Jun Zhang said in a research note Tuesday.Zhang is “bearish” on prospects for the new iPhone SE because he expects that its price will be similar to second-hand iPhone 6 handsets in large emerging markets.“Second-hand iPhone 6’s are sold online at $350 in China, which we believe will be same price range of the iPhone (SE),” he said, adding that the price difference is such that many users will go with the larger display phone.Apple faced a similar pricing problem when it launched the iPhone 5C handset alongside the iPhone 5S. The 5C was priced only $100 cheaper than the 5S but had a cheaper-looking plastic casing.Sales of the iPhone SE are likely to be ""modest"" at 10 million to 15 million units annually, RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani said in a research note Thursday. Still, the new phone could provide a buffer ahead of the launch of the iPhone 7, he said.Component suppliers likely to benefit from the iPhone refresh cycle include Jabil Circuit (JBL), Broadcom (AVGO), Amphenol (APH) and Texas Instruments (TXN), he said.Broadcom and fellow Apple chip supplier Microsemi (MSCC) both hit new buy points late last week.Also Monday, Apple is expected to unveil its third-generation 9.7-inch iPad Air, which will be given similar functionality and accessories to the 12.9-inch iPad Pro. The current iPad Air 2 was launched in October 2014. The iPad Pro with its Smart Keyboard and Apple Pencil debuted last September.But the tablet business has been in decline at Apple and the new iPad is unlikely to change that, analysts say.""We do not expect the updates to materially change our outlook for iPad units, which seem likely to continue declining through fiscal 2016, but at a moderating rate,"" Hargreaves said.Apple holds an IBD Composite Rating of 66 out of a possible 99, factoring in earnings growth, stock performance and several other metrics. Chipmaker Broadcom gets a 98, Amphenol a 91 and Texas Instruments an 84. Jabil is not currently highly rated by IBD, with a Composite Rating of just 47.

Chinese new loan data and money supply growth both missed their targets - igniting a renewed sell off in Asia......Oil falls back below $30/barrel - sending European mkts into a tizzy and causing US futures to dive.....Oil sanctions against Iran are due to expire on Monday allowing for new supply to hit the mkt......(not new news....but in a negative environment - it only adds to the angst)Ric Spooner - Chief analyst at CMC Markets in Sydney, Australia had this to say - ""Lower oil prices have been a sentiment leader for the recent market selloff and will again be in focus with Iranian sanctions expected to be lifted next week.  How fast Iran can put oil back on the market will now be a key issue for oil markets, with many skeptical that it will be able to do this nearly as fast as it has forecast.”While  Iran is trying to regain lost market share, they tell us that they do NOT intend to pressure prices with any EXPORT INCREASE  when the sanctions are removed - and we are supposed to believe them - WHY?  They have trouble with the truth - and that has been demonstrated time and time again.....so this time is different - HOW?  They will though attempt to increase their daily production by 100,000 barrels a day, or 3.7%, in the month after sanctions are lifted and by an additional 400,000 barrels a day within six months after the sanctions are lifted....which leaves us to ask - OK....then what do you intend to do with all that extra oil - bathe in it?  Eco data today includes Retail Sales exp of  -0.1%,  ex autos and gas of +0.2%, PPI final demand exp at -0.2%, ex food and energy of +0.1%....Empire State Manf of -4......Ind Prod of -0.2% and Cap Util of 76.8%......None of these reports will make any difference at all unless they really surprise.....otherwise the focus will be on earnings and oil....Earnings today include BLK , C, WFC, USB, .....Two FED speakers due out - Dudley at 9:00 a.m. and Kaplan at 1:00 p.m.  Dudley is the more important because he’s “leadership” and obviously his comments regarding recent volatility will be important.  Take good care.

313,MAC,"Worldwide shipments of personal computers fell 10.6% year over year in the fourth quarter to 71.9 million units. But Apple (AAPL) bucked the downturn, increasing shipments of its Mac computers by 2.8% to nearly 5.7 million units, research firm IDC reported late Tuesday.Rival research firm Gartner (IT) concurred on Apple's growth rate but estimated that overall PC sales dipped 8.3% in Q4 to 75.7 million units.The PC market continues to face such persistent challenges as longer PC life cycles and competition from smartphones and tablets, IDC said. Economic issues like falling commodity prices and weak international currencies also have hurt PC shipments, IDC added.China-based Lenovo remained the No. 1 PC vendor worldwide in Q4 with 21.4% market share, up from 20% a year earlier. HP Inc () was second with 19.9% share, followed by Dell (14.1%), Asus (7.9%) and Apple (7.9%).The PC market continued to show signs of consolidation in the fourth quarter. The top five vendors accounted for 71.3% of PC shipments, up from 67.1% a year earlier.In November, IDC predicted that two of the top 10 PC makers will exit the market within the next 24 months.

314,MAC,"Budget: Instead of cutting the budget and ""public works,"" such as bicycle museums and bridges to nowhere, Congress has resorted to exotic accounting gimmicks to make it seem as if it isn't raising taxes or debt to fund roads.Welcome to the new age of Enron budgeting. Just before the New Year's ball dropped, and while no one was watching, the Federal Reserve quietly transferred $19 billion of its ""equity capital"" to the Treasury Department. Congress saw this hidden stash of money as ""surplus funds"" hidden away to spend.And spend it they did — on a multiyear highway bill passed before they left town for Christmas.The Fed doesn't have any ""surplus funds."" To the extent that it's been operating as a giant government-sponsored commercial bank since the inception of the financial crisis in 2009, any income earned from owning mortgage-backed securities and purchasing other private assets is rightfully owned by the Fed's member banks.These private banks are supposed to receive dividend income on these funds. Instead, Congress chopped the dividend and confiscated the rest to pay its bills. Banks with $10 billion or less in assets were exempt from what is effectively a bank ""tax.""This highway funding scheme ""undermines a key agreement that has underpinned the U.S. banking system for a century,"" complained Rob Nichols, president and CEO of the American Bankers Association. ""Banks shouldn't be used like an E-Z Pass to pay for highways.""Even the usually tight-lipped Fed said it worries that this money grab may set a ""bad precedent.""Ya think? Don't be surprised if Congress now helps itself to the billions more in Fed accounts that it hasn't yet pilfered to feed its spending habit.An even greater danger is that these non-transparent fund transfers become an excuse for the Fed to vastly expand its interventions into the private economy as a for-profit investment bank.If it means more cash to spend, Congress may very well greenlight such a charter expansion for the central bank. We feel that's not in keeping with the Fed's claims of seeking greater transparency — not less.These are the kinds of double-dealing, revenue-raising ploys that have voters so distrustful and infuriated at anything Washington.We wonder if the financial geniuses who thought up this latest jujitsu can answer this question: Who's going to be available to bail out the Federal Reserve when it crashes from bad investments the way invulnerable Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac imploded a few years ago?Stung by criticisms from his own party, new House Speaker Paul Ryan promised at the end of last year that Congress was going to change the shady way it handles the nation's multitrillion-dollar finances.But if the highway bill's latest Fed raid is any test, this is sounding already like a hollow promise.

336,MAC,"Despite the launch of Microsoft's (MSFT) well-received Windows 10 operating system, personal computer shipments are expected to fall by 8.7% this year and won't return to growth until 2017.That's the assessment of market research firm IDC, which put out its latest worldwide PC shipment forecast on Wednesday.IDC says the PC market will see five years of declining shipments before returning to growth. The commercial market will fuel the recovery, the research group said. Meanwhile, consumer PC sales will continue to decline through at least the end of 2019.Global PC sales this year have been hurt by the decline of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, IDC said.In addition to economic issues, sales channels are sitting on a ""stubbornly large inventory of notebooks from prior quarters,"" IDC said in a press release.Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) made note of this situation in its fiscal third-quarter earnings report last Thursday.Sales channels are reluctant to take Windows 10 machines because of the inventory backlog and the unfavorable PC sales outlook for the rest of the year.Since Microsoft is making Windows 10 available as a free upgrade for one year to owners of Windows 7 and Windows 8 PCs, many people don't have an incentive to buy a new PC.IDC foresees a modest recovery in 2017, with the prospect of the next PC refresh cycle and the end of free Windows 10 upgrades.""Although the shortcomings of the PC business are obvious, a silver lining is that the industry has continued to refine the more mobile aspects of personal computers — contributing to higher growth in convertible and ultra-slim notebooks,"" IDC analyst Jay Chou said in a statement. ""The de-emphasis of touch on Windows 10 also paves the way for a more familiar experience and continuing unit growth on large-screen systems, particularly all-in-one PCs.""Microsoft announced Wednesday that Windows 10 is now on over 75 million devices, in less than a month. Windows 10 was made available for download and sold with new PCs starting July 29.One category of PC that is selling well now are low-cost Chromebooks running Google's (GOOGL) Chrome OS.The NPD Group reported Wednesday that Chromebooks have seen a steep rise in popularity in the K-12 education market. Chromebooks in schools also are boosting sales of ""peripherals"" such as Wi-Fi access points and charging carts, NPD analyst Michael Diamond said in a blog post.Apple (AAPL) also has defied the PC sales slump with its Mac computers. Apple was the only top 5 PC vendor to show an increase in unit shipments in the second quarter, IDC said.

337,MAC,"Some housing experts suggest that millennials may never participate to the same degree as their predecessors in the American dream of homeownership, or at least not anytime soon.
"
338,MAC,"About a fifth of the more than 80 million-strong cohort, a demographic usually described as ranging in age from the late teens or early 20s to the mid-30s, still live with their parents or other older relatives.
"
339,MAC,"About 50% are renters. Large numbers are considered underemployed and underpaid, and they have delayed the usual triggers for buying a home: marriage and kids.
"
340,MAC,"In July, first-time buyers accounted for just 28% of existing home sales, down from an already low 30% in June, according to the National Association of Realtors.
"
341,MAC,"In rosier times before the housing crisis, the historic average was a little less than 40% of the total, says Selma Hepp, chief economist with Trulia, a home-information website that is part of Zillow Group (Z). Their numbers spiked briefly in 2009, to nearly 39% of home sales. But that was due to a one-time tax credit for first-timers.
"
342,MAC,"Other evidence paints a more positive picture: Most millennials say they want to eventually buy a home if they don't already own one now. The big question: when?
"
343,MAC,"A survey by Trulia indicated that nine out of 10 millennials plan to buy a home, ""but not necessarily today,"" said Hepp.
"
344,MAC,"In the survey, 50% of those married with kids said they plan to buy sooner than later — within the next two years. ""The ones that have gotten married and have kids are trickling in now,"" Hepp said.
"
345,MAC,"""Our data and numerous data indicate they are coming back into the market and contributing a bigger share to the new-buyer market,"" she said. ""The thing is, in many markets where they would be buying, they may be constrained by affordability.""
"
346,MAC,"That's especially true in markets with good job growth, such as New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Austin, Texas. ""That is where you are also seeing low inventories and hence higher price appreciation,"" she said.
"
347,MAC,"Besides getting priced out of hot markets, July's dip in the percentage of first-time buyers might also have to do with those buyers jumping into the housing market in the spring and early summer in anticipation of expected interest-rate increases later this year, housing watchers say.
"
348,MAC,"""Monthly data is very volatile. I think it's going to continue to be a steady rate (up) for first-time buyers,"" Hepp said.
"
349,MAC,"First-time buyers with little savings often turn to Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loans, which require just 3.5% down.
"
350,MAC,"FHA loans' share of total home originations has been climbing this year. In July, FHA loans made up 22.8% of all home sales, up from 18.1% a year ago, according to a report out Thursday from RealtyTrac, a real estate data company.
"
351,MAC,"'Boomerang' Buyers Are Back
"
352,MAC,"One reason for the uptick may be tied to a cut in insurance fees on Jan. 26 — from 1.35% of the loan to 0.85% — which makes monthly payments lower. On a median-priced home nationwide, that comes to an annual savings of $917 a year, according to calculations made by RealtyTrac in January.
"
353,MAC,"But cash-poor ""boomerang"" buyers returning to the homebuying market after losing their homes in foreclosures in the housing downturn also are causing the mix of FHA loans to tick up, said Daren Blomquist, vice president at RealtyTrac.
"
354,MAC,"A new mortgage-lending option announced on Tuesday by Fannie Mae will make it easier for credit-worthy first-time borrowers with lower-to-moderate incomes to access financing — with as little as 3% down.
"
355,MAC,"The HomeReady mortgage will consider income from non-borrowers, such as parents, and rental income from a portion of the property, such as a room or basement.
"
356,MAC,"""We noted earlier this year that first-time home buyer activity seemed to accelerate as initial down payment requirements started to ease, and this new program should enable even more borrowers to come up with the initial down payment needed to acquire a home,"" wrote analyst Scot Ciccarelli of RBC Capital Markets in a client note on Wednesday.
"
357,MAC,"Are first-time buyers really coming back? ""I think they are,"" said Blomquist. ""FHA data is going up and (an FHA loan) is typically a first-time buyer.""
"
358,MAC,"Any sparks that send entry-level buyers into the buying pool would be good news for homebuilders that target them, such as D.R. Horton (DHI), with its Express Homes division, and LGI Homes (LGIH), both based in Texas, among others.
"
359,MAC,"Cash Buyers Retreat
"
360,MAC,"Blomquist says first-time buyers also are benefiting from lower numbers of cash buyers looking to buy homes. In July, cash buyers' share fell to an eight-year low, accounting for 22.6% of home purchases, down from 23.7% in June and 26.5% in July 2014.
"
361,MAC,"""Fewer cash buyers in the market opens up the market to first-time buyers,"" Blomquist said.
"
362,MAC,"But first-time buyers might not have much luck in the most expensive markets, where prices are still rising amid tight supply.
"
363,MAC,"Since February, one young couple in Los Angeles, professors at local colleges, lost bidding wars on 12 condos and townhomes, all priced under $800,000, before a bid on a townhome in Marina Del Rey was finally accepted a couple of weeks ago. Their offer of $740,000 was $10,000 above asking price.
"
364,MAC,"""It's rare we don't have multiple offers on properties,"" said Nikki Kilmer, an agent based in West L.A. for national realty company Redfin. ""But I'm seeing less cash buyers now than in June and July. Buyers have slowed their searches down because of the competition and prices (up 5% in L.A. in July vs. a year ago). Or they are deciding to hold off and wait until the market cools down, and maybe jump in around the holidays.""
"
365,MAC,"Before the recent stock-market tumble, the Federal Reserve was widely expected to raise interest rates before the end of the year. But most real estate watchers expect the increases from near-low levels to be minimal and gradual, as the Fed has said. In July, the interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 4.05%, up from 3.98% in June, according to Freddie Mac. On Thursday it was down to 3.84%.
"
366,MAC,"The Mortgage Bankers Association expects the 30-year fixed rate to edge up to 4.4% by the fourth quarter. The gradual increase in rates will likely be accompanied ""by a steady improvement in labor markets, which will help to offset the impact,"" said Lynn Fisher, a VP at the MBA, in an email to IBD. ""If anything, a slowly improving economy will provide first-time home buyers stability and the means to enter the market soon.""
"
367,MAC,"Markets in the ""sweet spot"" for first-time buyers are a cross between affordability and good jobs, says Nela Richardson, chief economist at Redfin.
"
368,MAC,"""There are very few places that have both nowadays. South Carolina is booming and is still relatively affordable,"" she said, pointing to Charleston in particular. ""Nashville is booming, The Midwest is still affordable. The coasts, not so good.""
"
369,MAC,"FHA loans may not be the best solution for all first-time buyers. ""It does come with costs,"" Richardson said. ""The annual (insurance) premium came down but not the upfront fee.""
"
370,MAC,"New FHA underwriting rules that went into effect in mid-June may also make it tougher to for first-time buyers to qualify, including changes in the way deferred student loans are factored into debt-to-ratio calculations and gaps in employment.
"
371,MAC,"What's more, a 3.5% down payment means higher monthly mortgage payments vs. a conventional loan, which typically requires 20% down.
"
372,MAC,"""You don't need a lot of savings but you need income,"" Richardson said. ""That's the sticker. Wages are still stagnant. Incomes have not kept up with price increases.""
"
373,MAC,"In a Redfin survey in July of more than 3,500 buyers, the 1,400 first-time buyers ""almost to the letter said they were concerned about the high prices and the competition,"" Richardson said.
"
374,MAC,"Housing watchers are hopeful that millennials will gradually step up to the homebuying plate in larger numbers. And when they do, they'll likely have a big impact. Their sheer numbers alone are impressive — larger than the baby-boom generation.
"
375,MAC,"""This is not the last hurrah,"" Blomquist said.
"
376,MAC,"But their impact won't likely be felt overnight.
"
377,MAC,"""Just getting millennials out of their parents' homes will take time,"" said housing consultant Leanne Lachman in a speech earlier this year.Some housing experts suggest that millennials may never participate to the same degree as their predecessors in the American dream of homeownership, or at least not anytime soon.About a fifth of the more than 80 million-strong cohort, a demographic usually described as ranging in age from the late teens or early 20s to the mid-30s, still live with their parents or other older relatives.About 50% are renters.

On Thursday it was down to 3.84%.The Mortgage Bankers Association expects the 30-year fixed rate to edge up to 4.4% by the fourth quarter. The gradual increase in rates will likely be accompanied ""by a steady improvement in labor markets, which will help to offset the impact,"" said Lynn Fisher, a VP at the MBA, in an email to IBD. ""If anything, a slowly improving economy will provide first-time home buyers stability and the means to enter the market soon.""Markets in the ""sweet spot"" for first-time buyers are a cross between affordability and good jobs, says Nela Richardson, chief economist at Redfin.""There are very few places that have both nowadays. South Carolina is booming and is still relatively affordable,"" she said, pointing to Charleston in particular. ""Nashville is booming, The Midwest is still affordable. The coasts, not so good.""FHA loans may not be the best solution for all first-time buyers. ""It does come with costs,"" Richardson said. ""The annual (insurance) premium came down but not the upfront fee.""New FHA underwriting rules that went into effect in mid-June may also make it tougher to for first-time buyers to qualify, including changes in the way deferred student loans are factored into debt-to-ratio calculations and gaps in employment.What's more, a 3.5% down payment means higher monthly mortgage payments vs. a conventional loan, which typically requires 20% down.""You don't need a lot of savings but you need income,"" Richardson said. ""That's the sticker. Wages are still stagnant. Incomes have not kept up with price increases.""In a Redfin survey in July of more than 3,500 buyers, the 1,400 first-time buyers ""almost to the letter said they were concerned about the high prices and the competition,"" Richardson said.Housing watchers are hopeful that millennials will gradually step up to the homebuying plate in larger numbers. And when they do, they'll likely have a big impact. Their sheer numbers alone are impressive — larger than the baby-boom generation.""This is not the last hurrah,"" Blomquist said.But their impact won't likely be felt overnight.""Just getting millennials out of their parents' homes will take time,"" said housing consultant Leanne Lachman in a speech earlier this year.

378,MAC,"A top Federal Reserve policymaker signaled he's less interested in raising rates next month, while durable goods orders and business investment picked up, at least in July.Fed's Dudley: September rate hike 'less compelling'New York Federal Reserve President William Dudley said Wednesday that he's less interested in a Fed ""liftoff"" next month, citing ""international and financial market developments.""""From my perspective, at this moment, the decision to begin the normalization process at the September FOMC meeting seems less compelling to me than it was a few weeks ago,"" he said.Dudley said he ""really"" hopes to see higher rates this year.Durable goods jump in JulyOrders were up 2% in July, trouncing expectations of a 0.4% decline, while a 3.4% gain in June was revised up to 4.1%. New orders remain 20% lower vs. a year ago, though that's largely due to summer air show orders skewing the data. Excluding the volatile transportation sector, orders rose 0.6% in July, also stronger than forecast. Core capital goods orders rose 2.2%, the second straight increase. Such positive data shows domestic strength amid global market woes. But will it last?

388,MAC,"Financial Crisis: Ex-Fed Chief Ben Bernanke now claims he thought bankers should have gone to prison for the mortgage mess. He's shamelessly pandering to the Wall Street-hating media ahead of his memoir's release.Bernanke is also a hypocrite. Ahead of Tuesday's publication of his tome ""The Courage to Act: A Memoir of a Crisis and Its Aftermath,"" he told USA Today that the Justice Department should have done more than just shake down Wall Street banks for $100 billion in fines and subprime damages.""It would have been my preference to have more investigation of individual action,"" he intoned, ""since obviously everything that went wrong or was illegal was done by some individual, not by an abstract firm.""He questioned Justice's policy to train criminal investigations on financial firms, not the human beings who led them.""The Fed is not a law-enforcement agency,"" Bernanke said, conveniently absolving himself of blame. ""The Department of Justice and others are responsible for that, and a lot of their efforts have been to indict or threaten to indict financial firms (but) you can't put a financial firm in jail.""So in that respect,"" he added, ""I think there should have been more accountability at the individual level.""Should someone have gone to prison?""Yeah.""This is all very odd, because in his next thought, Bernanke pats himself on the back for bailing out the Wall Street bankers he now says he would have indicted:""The Fed was very much engaged in doing that.""Odder still, he doesn't even call for incarcerating bank executives in his 600-page memoir. Quite the opposite, he says politicians on the left who demanded ""a few Wall Streeters get their just deserts"" were ""uninformed."" He writes that locking them up would have done nothing to solve the financial crisis.It appears that Bernanke doesn't really believe bankers should be cuffed and stuffed but is merely trying to win the favor of the media to help promote sales of his book. He is jumping on the left's bandwagon. Last month, liberal pundits praised new Attorney General Loretta Lynch for issuing a memo to criminal prosecutors nationwide to set their sights on individual Wall Street bank honchos.Of course, there's plenty of crisis blame to go around — why limit it to Wall Street?What about government officials in Washington ... such as Bernanke himself? After all, he was a member of the Federal Reserve Board for most of the 2002-2006 period when the Fed aggressively slashed interest rates, which stoked risky subprime cash-out refinancing.And what about then-Democratic House banking chief Barney Frank, the affordable-housing zealot who pressured Fannie Mae execs to ""roll the dice a little bit more"" in the subprime market?Or former Housing and Urban Development Department Secretary Andrew Cuomo, who forced both Fannie and Freddie Mac to meet dangerously high subprime mortgage quotas?Or President Clinton, who rewrote the Community Reinvestment Act to encourage more subprime lending and, as Paul Sperry's ""The Great American Bank Robbery"" points out, persuaded then-central banker Alan Greenspan to issue an edict relaxing mortgage underwriting standards at the Fed's member banks?Bernanke might want to consult his predecessor Greenspan, who has testified that Clinton's new anti-redlining rules also incentivized Wall Street to securitize the riskier CRA loans. Without the CRA, Greenspan said, the mortgage bust ""would have been a much smaller problem and, indeed, very unlikely to have taken on the dimensions that it did.""Perhaps the reason no Wall Street bigwigs have been hauled into court is because the criminal masterminds in Washington are worried they would sing, and sing loudly.

391,MAC,"Education: Student loans, once a minor nuisance for grads, have turned into a nightmare for many of the current college generation. But have no fear: The government is doing something about it. And that's the problem.'Shaky Colleges Get Help On Bad Loans"" blares a page one Wall Street Journal headline. The story details how the Education Department helps colleges that have so many students defaulting on their loans, the schools are at risk of losing access to federal aid.The idea is to help troubled colleges improve bookkeeping and other accounting techniques to make their numbers more presentable to the federal government.Once again, government to the rescue. But a major new study suggests that the federal government isn't the solution of the student loan crisis; it is the problem.In a sweeping new study, ""Accounting for the Rise in College Tuition,"" economists Grey Gordon and Aaron Hedlund conclude that ""demand shocks"" from federal loans, subsidies and aid ""lead to higher college costs and more debt, and in the absence of higher labor market returns, more loan default inevitably occurs.""In a nutshell, federal loan aid to colleges is pushing up tuition faster than inflation. Students must take out ever higher amounts of debt to pay for their education, but starting salaries haven't kept up. If students don't get good jobs when they graduate, many will default.The study, published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, shows conclusively that growth in one program — the Federal Student Loan Program — was more than enough to account for the entire rise in college tuition from 1987 to 2010 — a stunning conclusion that suggests a massive market failure.From 2006 to today, total student loan debt soared from $517 billion to $1.3 trillion, a 152% jump, to cover surging tuition costs. Over that same period, real starting wages for college grads were essentially flat.Sadly, this should be no surprise, given recent history.Whenever government gets involved in subsidizing anything — from sugar to home mortgages — higher prices emerge, leading to market disruptions and, often, a ""crisis.""Protected by a phalanx of big government politicians and lobbyists, the federal government always blames the private sector for the crises that it creates. It then puts forth its ""solution"" — always more federal spending, more rules, more subsidies, less private sector.This, by the way, is precisely what happened with the financial crisis, in which government regulations, mandates and subsidies pushed up low-income homebuying to record levels — with many people given mortgages that they couldn't possibly pay. The bust was painful, leading to what's now known as the Great Recession.And yet our government never learns.Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac still make up way more than half the market for all home mortgages, pushing up prices in the housing market — and sowing the seeds of the next housing crisis.Today, education, like housing, is still considered by many — especially ""progressive"" Democrats — to be ""too important to be left to the free market."" It's a big reason why President Obama took over the student loan program in 2010 — effectively nationalizing it — and why it's drowning in red ink.Paying for college education isn't too important to be left to the market. In fact, college education is too important to be left to an incompetent, overweening federal government's incessant meddling.

392,MAC,"The economy rose at a 2% annual rate in the third quarter, revised down from 2.1% and Q2's 3.9%, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. The U.S. is on pace for a 10th straight year of failing to achieve 3% annual growth. That helps explain why it took nearly a decade for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates, and why Donald Trump has had so much support in his presidential run.
"
393,MAC,"In the third quarter, exports were a little weaker than previously estimated, as U.S. manufacturers and others struggle to sell to weak overseas economies amid a strong dollar. Inventories rose a little less than expected, subtracting 0.7 percentage point from Q3 GDP growth. Most economists expect business destockpiling still has a ways to go.
"
394,MAC,"Business investment rose at a 9.9% pace, the best in a year. Consumer spending, which accounts for roughly 70% of economic activity, rose at a solid 3% pace amid improving jobs and wages and cheap gas prices at the pump.

485,MAC,"Subprime Redux: While few were paying attention last week, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac regulator Mel Watt quietly reinstated the risky ""affordable housing"" quotas that helped cause the financial crisis. Here we go again.The federal housing mandates created the housing bubble by forcing the mortgage giants to buy subprime home loans, something that Watt promoted while in Congress.Increasing the goal numbers, as Watt is doing again for ""low-income, high-minority areas,"" fueled a national decline in lending standards and led to Fannie and Freddie's bankruptcy. Yet now the administration is doubling down on that disaster.To meet its goals for purchasing those low-quality loans, Fannie and Freddie are lowering their standards again. As Einstein said, insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, and expecting different results.So what is the rationale of Watt, whom President Obama last year appointed head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) overseeing Fannie and Freddie, and essentially the entire mortgage industry that they dominate?According to the final rule raising the FHFA's affordable housing goals, Watt thinks Fannie and Freddie must do more to expand credit for communities hit hardest by the subprime crisis. He says that hiking their benchmarks for lending in low-income minority areas will help boost sagging minority homeownership rates and close what has become a yawning gap in overall wealth between minority and white communities.""FHFA Director Watt noted that the problem of low wealth is particularly acute for communities of color,"" the 156-page regulation states.It adds that the wider wealth gap has ""stripped"" minorities of resources necessary to re-qualify for home loans: ""Another challenge to affordability is the relatively limited resources that many prospective households have available for making down payments.""Watt already has eased Fannie and Freddie's purchase guidelines to allow for just 3% down payments, though the size of a down payment is a reliable indicator of whether a borrower will repay — and though slashing down-payment requirements led to an explosion of defaults in the last mortgage bust. Thanks to government pressure, Fannie and Freddie booked roughly half the bad loans that wrecked the economy.Watt would have set the mortgage goals higher, except that banks are keeping more and more low-income and very low-income borrowers' mortgages in their portfolios. As a result, the banks don't sell the mortgages to any entity on the secondary market, making it harder for Fannie or Freddie to meet goals set much higher.Why are lenders holding these loans? Because of the Community Reinvestment Act, another crisis culprit.""Lenders are originating these loans to comply with the Community Reinvestment Act but prefer to hold them in portfolio to protect against the risk that (Fannie and Freddie) require the lenders to repurchase the loans, which they may consider somewhat likely to default,"" the FHFA says.""Likely to default""? No kidding. Yet Obama officials have insisted that CRA loans are ""sound"" and had nothing to do with the mortgage bust.The new housing mandates, which extend through 2017 and remain after Obama leaves, include a boost in the share of low-income housing units that Fannie and Freddie must buy. By the end of 2017, Fannie and Freddie must each buy at least 360,000 low- and very low-income apartment units annually to please regulators.The tougher apartment mandate is designed to encourage the development of low-income housing ""outside of areas with high concentrations of minority and low-income residents."" This plan dovetails with HUD's own new regulation, Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing, which forces suburbs to ease zoning restrictions on Section 8 and other subsidized housing.History shows that loosening credit terms creates artificial demand pressures that pump housing prices higher and higher, leading to feral booms and painful busts. Obama and his race-mongering social engineers are dooming the nation to repeat history.Connect with IBD Editorials: @IBDeditorials and Facebook

486,MAC,"Would you pay the same price for a Mini Mac instead of a Big Mac? Raising the average fast-food wage to $15 an hour could force restaurants to hike prices by 11% — or shrink the size of burgers by 36%, according to an IBD analysis of data from a recent Purdue University study.
"
487,MAC,"Higher prices and smaller burgers are just two of the unappetizing menu of options facing fast-food chains and their customers as cities such as Los Angeles, Seattle and New York raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour.
"
488,MAC,"Wendy's (WEN) management last week said it will ramp up self-order kiosks and other automation efforts later this year to offset future wage inflation. It expects franchisees to do the same, especially in the markets facing the biggest minimum-wage hikes.

489,MAC,"""In some of these markets, the New Yorks . . . our franchisee will likely look at the opportunity to reduce overall staff . . . to certainly reduce hours and any other cost reduction opportunities, not just price (hikes),"" CEO Emil Bolick told Wall Street analysts.

"
496,MAC,"The actual data assembled by the Purdue researchers reveal that if restaurants cut portion sizes instead of hiking prices, they would have to shrink the size of burgers by 36%. That's three times the 12% cut errantly calculated by the researchers.
"
497,MAC,"Likewise, the authors' data indicate that restaurants would have to raise prices by 11.3% to fully offset higher wages. That's nearly three times the 4% necessary hike erroneously calculated by the authors.
"
498,MAC,"This analysis doesn't factor in any reduced demand from higher prices or smaller burgers, which might force further price hikes. While Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) seems to be able to pass on big price hikes to its relatively affluent patrons, fast-food chains such as McDonald's (MCD), Wendy's, Burger King (QSR) and Yum Brands' (YUM) Taco Bell struggle to shift any cost increases to their diners.

499,MAC,"On the other hand, restaurants could save some recruiting and training expenses if higher wages reduce worker turnover.
"
500,MAC,"Ignoring such indirect effects, a $3.99 Big Mac at McDonald's would have to be priced 45 cents higher, not 17 cents, to offset extra labor costs tied to an average $15 fast-food wage.
"
501,MAC,"Most reporters assumed that Purdue researchers were measuring the cost of a $15 minimum wage, but the study doesn't attempt that. Because there would have to be some supervisors who earn more, a $15 minimum wage would require still-higher prices.
"
502,MAC,"The authors estimated that 2013 pay and benefits for fast-food workers averaged $12.80 an hour. That may be too high. But using that figure, a median-size outlet with nine workers clocking 30 hours a week would pay out almost $180,000 for the full staff. The authors then calculate that raising the average wage to $15 an hour would increase total staff compensation to $253,352.
"
503,MAC,"Thus, the restaurant would have to bring in roughly $73,000 more in sales to cover the extra labor costs. Yet the authors somehow calculate only $27,561 in additional revenue is needed.

505,MAC,"The authors note that labor and food make up a fairly similar share of a restaurant's budget: 28.5% for labor and 33% for food. Yet they then figure that raising labor costs by 42% could be offset with a 12% food budget cut.

506,MAC,"How could they possibly have made such errors? James Sherk, a research fellow in labor economics at the conservative Heritage Foundation, discovered that the authors added together the pieces of a median restaurant budget, including pre-tax profits, as reported by the National Restaurant Association for a typical outlet.

She wants to be the tough, new regulatory cop on the beat.Her plan would tax banks that get too big and assign federal regulators, presumably the Securities and Exchange Commission, ""the authority and tools necessary to reorganize, downsize and ultimately break up any financial institution that is too large and risky to be managed effectively.""This call to ""break up"" banks would be a nearly unprecedented grant of power to the regulatory state and its control over American commerce. In Clinton's world, we would bail out and subsidize banks if they don't make money but then tax and break them up if they make too much.These new rules would apply to ""too big to fail"" banks with more than $50 billion in assets. She fails to mention that it's precisely the high cost of Dodd-Frank compliance that has led to the ongoing consolidation in the banking industry. Big megabanks are able to absorb Dodd-Frank costs; small community banks often cannot. Doubling down on regulation will only accelerate the process of the whales swallowing the minnows.Clinton wants to close ""loopholes that still allow banks to make speculative gambles with taxpayer-backed deposits."" She wants to get rid of ""risky credit swaps and derivatives at taxpayer-backed banks.""But she has her history wrong. For the umpteenth time: Derivatives weren't the assets that crashed and shut down our financial system. It was government-insured mortgage-backed securities that went bust.The brilliant government regulators incentivized banks to hold these ""safe"" assets to meet their capital requirements. Great advice. If the banks had held more derivatives in 2008 and fewer MBSs, they would have lost less money.Finally, she proposes to assess an exit tax on corporations such as Pfizer that are planning to leave the U.S. to cut down their tax bills. There's no plan to cut the corporate tax rate, which is what inspires companies to leave in the first place, but she'd wallop them with a tax bill for being ""unpatriotic."" She will only ensure that fewer Googles and Facebooks and Pfizers are American companies in the first place.Clinton crows that her re-regulation plan has already won the ""praise"" of people like former Massachusetts Rep. Barney Frank. What a persuasive endorsement. Frank, the former chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, announced on the eve of the crisis that he wanted to ""roll the dice"" on the housing market — which he did, losing bundles of taxpayer money.Most amazing about Clinton's scheme is who it exempts from scrutiny: Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the two institutions at the epicenter of the financial forest fire. These government institutions guaranteed high-risk, low-down-payment mortgages, and they received the largest taxpayer bailouts.Worst yet, Fannie and Freddie are back with the same low-down-payment policies that accounted for a large percentage of the defaulted real estate loans. If we're going to head off the next financial crash, it's Fannie and Freddie that we should ""rein in,"" not Wall Street.Clinton's final populist proposal is to levy new fines and even criminal penalties against financial CEOs because, as she puts it, ""No one should be too big to jail.""Bold words from a woman who was chief executive at the State Department during the Benghazi fiasco and is under federal investigation for illegal use of emails that may have impaired national security.Be careful what you wish for, Madam Secretary.

The Mortgage Bankers Association is seeking explicit 2016 targets for this kind of ""up-front"" risk-sharing, the trade association said in a letter this week addressed to Mel…
"
524,MAC,"Housing: A new crop of mortgage companies with ties to Countrywide Financial and other now-defunct subprime lenders are making loans to riskier and riskier borrowers. And the Obama regime is encouraging them.'All are headquartered in Southern California, the epicenter of the last decade's subprime lending industry,"" the Los Angeles Times reports in a front-page piece, ""After subprime collapse, nonbank lenders again dominate riskier mortgages.""""And all are run by former executives of Countrywide Financial, the once-giant mortgage lender that made tens of billions of dollars in risky loans that contributed to the 2008 financial crisis,"" the Times added, without noting how the Clinton regime conscripted Countrywide to open up lending to poor minorities.With housing-price bubbles re-forming in California and other major markets, housing experts fear a replay of massive defaults on these shaky mortgages if home values drop.But didn't Dodd-Frank's offspring, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, set new mortgage rules to stop underwriting of subprime loans? Yes, but the new rules set no minimum requirements for the two key predictors of defaults: credit scores and down payments.With President Obama's blessing, the Federal Housing Administration has loosened credit-score and down-payment requirements, along with other underwriting standards, for FHA loans for first-time and bad-credit buyers. So these Countrywide clones don't actually have to adhere to ""strict new lending standards,"" as the administration claims.It should come as no surprise, then, that these new subprime-tied lenders have cornered the market for FHA and other government loans, and now control 64% of those riskier loans.At the same time, Obama appointee Mel Watt has launched a handful of initiatives as head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency to help more low-income and first-time buyers afford homes, including allowing down payments as low as 3% for home loans backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The goal is to bring many subprime borrowers who lost their homes to foreclosure back into the market, as ""rebound borrowers.""The regime also seeks to expand access to credit for first-time buyers who can't otherwise qualify for home loans due to low income and bad credit. As a result, the share of first-time buyers in the market is soaring. It stood at 56% in October, thanks mostly to easier FHA and agency lending.""This increased first-time buyer share comes with a downside: greater reliance on looser lending,"" American Enterprise Institute analyst Tobias Peter warns.AEI's first-time buyer risk index (FBMRI), which measures the risk of all government-backed mortgages, stood at 15.6% in October, up 1.2 percentage points from a year earlier. The index estimates the share of first-time buyer mortgages that would default under stress comparable to the 2007-08 financial crisis.The FBMRI is six percentage points higher than the mortgage risk index for repeat homebuyers, Peter says, and the gap has been widening.In October, 70% of first-time buyer mortgages had down payments of 5% or less. More, the median FICO credit score for first-time buyers with agency mortgages was 708, slightly below the U.S. median of 713. For first-time buyers with FHA loans, the median FICO score in October was 677 — well below the U.S. median.""These findings suggest that lending standards are already loose,"" Peter said, ""and that a return to more prudent standards is called for.""History shows that loosening credit terms creates artificial demand pressures that pump housing prices higher and higher, leading to feral booms and painful busts. Obama and his social engineers are dooming the nation to repeat a very ugly chapter in economic history.

575,MAC,"Gov. Rick Perry's Remarks on Wall Street ReformsTwo hundred and twenty-three years ago, twenty-four businessmen gathered under a buttonwood tree four miles south of here and signed an agreement to the following effect: “We the Subscribers, Brokers for the Purchase and Sale of the Public Stock do hereby solemnly promise and pledge ourselves to each other, that we will not buy or sell from this day for any person whatsoever any kind of Public Stock at a less rate than one quarter percent Commission…”It was signed on May 17th, 1792, one of the most consequential days in U.S. history: the founding of the New York Stock Exchange.So much of what has made America the most prosperous country in the world is a result of what those 24 men signed under that tree outside of 68 Wall Street. It was also on Wall Street that George Washington took the oath of office as our first President. And it was on Wall Street that the Bill of Rights was proposed by the first United States Congress.But for a century or more, Wall Street has been famous for one thing: its role as the financial engine of the world’s economy. It has funded entrepreneurs, homeowners and the world’s great innovators.However, Wall Street’s reputation isn’t what it once was.After the bailouts of 2008, Americans came to believe that Wall Street is out for itself. That the game is rigged. That the wealthy and the well-connected have insurmountable advantages over average Americans who simply work hard and play by the rules.At a time when average Americans have experienced stagnant wages for a quarter century — while dealing with the rising costs of health care, child care, college tuition and consumer goods — distrust with Wall Street, as well as Washington, is probably greater than any time in the modern era.And for good reason: most Americans see a special political class that spends large sums of money to wield influence, to protect entrenched interests, to advocate for special favors at the expense of taxpayers and the general public.This kind of cronyism has transformed capitalism into corporatism, where profit is secured without risk. Where government officials reward cronies in pet industries, forcing taxpayers to pick up the tab for companies like Solyndra, or quasi-public entities like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.Wall Street should not be let off the hook for its bad behavior. Banks made a lot of mistakes regarding risk management leading up to the crisis. Some financiers intentionally misled investors and customers. They pushed people into deceptive financial products.This is wrong. But instead of them being punished, it was average Americans who paid a tremendous price.To be quite frank, they were screwed. They were not bailed out. They lost jobs, homes and savings. And they have every right to still be angry about it.But I am tired of politicians bashing Wall Street while ignoring the sins of Washington, D.C.It was Washington regulators who fell asleep at the switch. It was Washington politicians who changed laws that created the housing crisis.The roots of the financial crisis can be traced to the 1990s. President Clinton’s goal was to add another 8 million people to the ranks of homeowners. He sought to achieve this goal by forcing the two federally-backed mortgage giants — Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac — to increase from 30 percent to 42 percent the share of mortgages they sponsored from low- and moderate-income borrowers.In 2000, Clinton increased the share requirement yet again, to 50 percent.In a speech on his housing policies, President Clinton said: “Our home ownership strategy will not cost the taxpayers one extra cent. It will not require legislation. It will not add more federal programs or grow federal bureaucracy.”It reminds me of the promise, “if you like your doctor you can keep your doctor.”The truth of the matter is many Republicans were for these changes too. In fact, Under the Bush Administration in 2008, Washington told Fannie and Freddie they wanted 56 percent of loans to go to low- and moderate-income borrowers. So it is fair to say there was bipartisan support for Fannie, Freddie and private mortgage lenders eroding their lending standards in order to meet the Clinton-era requirements.This set in motion catastrophic events. Lower-income Americans started taking out mortgages that, in many cases, they couldn’t really afford. And upper-income Americans started taking advantage of the relaxed standards to buy even larger homes than the ones they already had.Prior to 1992, nearly all mortgages held by Fannie and Freddie had been purchased by Americans with good credit, who had paid at least 10-20 percent down — what bankers call prime mortgages.But by 2008, half of the mortgages in the country — 31 million of them — failed to meet the prime standard, thanks to the new Clinton regulations. And three-quarters of those non-prime mortgages were held by government agencies or government-backed entities like Fannie Mae.Not only were Americans buying homes with little or no money down, but they had no documentation of their income or assets. The banks looked away. The regulators looked away. Everyone pretended the good times would never end.When some people warned that danger was afoot, Democrats Chris Dodd and Barney Frank blocked reforms to the federal mortgage system.Said Congressman Frank, “I want to roll the dice a little bit more in this situation toward subsidized housing.” Looks like Congressman Frank rolled snake-eyes.As Americans began to borrow more money to buy bigger houses, demand went up and prices went up. A whole ecosystem of lobbyists emerged to block reform, and ensure that the party could go on. People started saying that housing prices would never go down again. And then the music stopped.During the good times of the ‘90’s, seeds were sown that would do great harm to the middle class in America.If Secretary Clinton wants to take credit for the “Clinton economy,” then she must defend the destructive home ownership policies advocated by her husband that pushed shoddy loans to people who couldn’t afford them, and the economic chaos that followed.Once the smoke cleared, Congress misdiagnosed the problem, passed the wrong remedy, and actually made things worse. In 2010, Chris Dodd and Barney Frank wrote a new bill that bears their name.In the five years since President Obama signed Dodd-Frank into law, Fannie and Freddie have been backing even more mortgages than they did before.During the housing bubble, taxpayers backed around 50 percent of all American mortgages. Today, they back around 60 percent of them. Thanks to Dodd-Frank’s blizzard of new regulations, it has become extremely difficult for investors to set up new funds. And the law’s so-called “Volcker Rule” which is supposed to prevent banks from making risky bets, has become so cumbersome that banks can’t adequately manage their balance sheets.It’s everyday Americans who are paying the highest price for it. Credit card and checking account fees have gone up. Nearly one million people were shut out of mainstream banking from 2009 to 2011. So instead, many turned to riskier forms of credit, such as payday loans, as lenders of last resort.Over 1,300 community banks have closed, making life for small businesses much more difficult. Yet the big banks are bigger than ever. Three decades ago, the six largest U.S. banks held assets amounting to 14 percent of our GDP. Today, it’s 61 percent.If you thought the financial crisis of 2008 was bad, wait until the next serious economic downturn.The fact is the Obama Administration is pursuing some of the same reckless policies that caused the housing crash of 2007 and 2008. Fannie and Freddie are still pushing relaxed credit standards, and down payments on homes that are too low.The next crash is on the horizon, and the question is: have we learned anything from the last one?That’s why, today, I am proposing a new agenda for Wall Street reform, one that will do far more than Dodd-Frank to end the era of bailouts and cronyism.If we want to truly end “too big to fail,” we need to restore market forces to banking, where failure is not rewarded or bailed out.I want to be very clear: if I am elected president of the United States, we will not bail out a single bank on Wall Street.Concentrating assets in the hands of a few giant banking institutions is a recipe for massive bailouts. Systemically important banks can borrow money at lower rates, giving them a substantial competitive advantage, because investors know those banks will be bailed out in the future. It has to stop.We have to level the playing field between small banks and big ones. Second, we have to put forward smart regulations that make it less likely that the banks of the future will fail.I don’t always agree with the Federal Reserve, but last week they announced the final version of a new rule that points us in a promising new direction.The Fed examined America’s eight largest banks — the Global Systemically Important Banks, or G-SIBs — and the Fed required them to harbor additional capital requirements: financial cushions in case of another downturn.What’s smart about this new rule is that it uses a formula to ensure that bigger and more complex banks must maintain larger capital cushions. In that way, the Fed has reduced, but not eliminated, the risk that these banks will someday fail again.The Federal Reserve and Congress should consider strengthening this rule, to help assure American taxpayers that they won’t be on the hook for trillion-dollar bailouts in the future.Let me say a few more words about the Federal Reserve.I mentioned the role of Washington politicians and Wall Street financiers in the financial crisis of 2008. But it bears noting the Fed shares part of the burden too. They kept interest rates too low for too long. They created the conditions for the housing bubble that crashed in 2007 and 2008. And they are creating those conditions again.We must have steady, reliable currency. We must have a predictable money supply. And we must have market-based rules that make the Fed transparent and understandable to everyone.We also need smarter regulations than the Volcker Rule. We could once again require banks to separate their traditional commercial lending and investment banking and related practices. Alternatively, these large, one-stop-shop banks could be required to hold a significant, additional capital cushion for their trading activities.Who knows? Those banks’ shareholders just might convince them to break up into smaller units on their own, in order to unlock the value of their distinct parts.We should replace Dodd-Frank’s so-called “orderly liquidation authority” with a true, orderly bankruptcy process, so that banks of any size can fail. Small banks can be closed by the FDIC in a weekend. A reformed bankruptcy code for big banks can help make bailouts obsolete. In 2012, scholars at the Hoover Institution proposed adding a new Chapter 14 to the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, with this express purpose in mind.We should create regulatory breathing room for banking with digital currencies, like Bitcoin. Digital currencies harbor the possibility of reducing the cost and improving the quality of financial transactions in much the same way that the conventional internet has done for consumer goods and services.We have to free up credit for small businesses on Main Street in order to truly revive our economy. I once served on a community bank board in the small town of Haskell, Texas. I can assure you that its capital was vital to the prospects of Main Street businesses.Dodd-Frank took aim at Wall Street and ended up harming Main Street. And today, community banks are spending more time and money on legal compliance than ever before. We should exempt community banks, banks run as partnerships, and asset management firms from Dodd-Frank’s onerous and excessive regulations. And let me say a word about one of Dodd-Frank’s least accountable new agencies: the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. It’s run by a sole director and can spend whatever the Federal Reserve wants it to spend, without Congressional review.The regulations imposed by the CFPB haven’t protected consumers, they’ve made credit cards and checking accounts more expensive. They’ve also made it harder for community banks to compete and stay in business.At a minimum, we need to reform the CFPB so that its leadership and funding are accountable to Congress. We also need to put the CFPB under a strict regulatory budget, so that it doesn’t do more damage to consumers than it already has.Lastly, Congress should wind down Fannie and Freddie. In the meantime, the two mortgage giants should maintain strict capital cushions, just like the big banks, and we should phase in a requirement that all loans that they sponsor are accompanied by higher, more responsible down payments.And let me be clear: if we want a vibrant home lending market in America, we need to stop the trend of pushing more and more home loans to Fannie and Freddie and start rejuvenating the private insurance market again.Before I move off of financial reform and talk about the economy more broadly, I want to discuss why Texas largely escaped the housing crash of 2007 and 2008.To put it simply, no one running for President has a stronger economic record than I do. The proof is in Texas’ performance after the Great Recession.From December 2007 to December 2014, Texas added 1.5 million jobs. The rest of the country lost 400,000 jobs over that same time period. We did this by keeping our taxes low, and our regulations and frivolous lawsuits to a minimum, and by educating our kids.And significantly, Texas didn’t have a housing crash like the ones they faced in Florida and Nevada. One analyst recently estimated that more than a third of Florida’s job growth, under Jeb Bush’s administration, was due to the housing bubble.During the Great Recession, the national house price index fell by 20 percent. In Texas, it fell by less than one percent. In 2011, 27 percent of all first mortgages in America were underwater. In Texas, only seven percent were. Among non-prime borrowers, 54 percent of mortgages were underwater across the country, compared to only 10 percent in Texas.Part of the reason for our success is that Texas has flexible zoning laws and land use regulations. Our cities have been able to expand the supply of housing along with their expanding population.But there’s another thing we have in Texas that the rest of the country could learn from: we regulate, in an intelligent way, the use of a type of mortgage called “cash-out refinancing.”During the housing bubble, in most parts of the country, American homeowners could take advantage of an increase in the value of their home to refinance their mortgage and take cash out, as if their house was their own ATM.For many Americans, this was a great financial resource. But for some, it was a way to borrow and spend even more than they otherwise would have. Where cash-out refis were common, the housing bubble got worse.The problem was that when the bubble burst, homeowners who had done cash-out refis at the peak were suddenly underwater with their loans, and many went into default.In Texas, we’ve been regulating cash-out refis since our great state joined the Union. Today, we limit the amount of cash you can take out of your home to 80 percent of its value.This simple rule protected Texas from the worst of the housing crisis. We can stabilize the housing market across America, if Fannie and Freddie are required to hold their loans to the same standard.If we do these things — if we end too big to fail, and stabilize our housing markets — we will have come a long way in restoring Americans’ faith in the ability of the free market economy to work for them.But what’s most important, for both Main Street and Wall Street, is that we get our economy back on track.There is nothing wrong in America today that can’t be fixed with new leadership. We’re just a few good decisions away from unleashing tremendous growth.But there is a major battle concerning the right economic policy for America.Democrats have a 1915 view of the 2015 economy.The problem is they are building a toll bridge to the 21st Century, with higher health care costs for employers, a higher cost of living for single moms in blue states because of their land use policies.Now Hillary Clinton wants to raise capital gains taxes.She thought it was a bad idea in 2008. Her husband cut capital gains in the 90’s. But now that she is a proponent of Warrenism, she is for taxing capital gains, which is already double-taxation on Americans.And here is where Democrats are blind to the effects of their policies: Secretary Clinton’s plan won’t do much harm to rich people who can offshore jobs, capital and investment, but it will harm average Americans, who can’t hire an army of accountants to lower their tax burden.When you kill “risk capital” you kill economic growth. And economic growth is the only solution to stagnant wages.The answer to the failed Obama-Clinton policies is not to raise taxes more. It is not to amp up the regulatory state. It is not to protest the innovation economy and companies like Uber because of antiquated views on labor.The answer is growth.Growth is the key to funding education. Growth is the key to funding health care. Growth is the key to reducing poverty. And growth is the key to investing in our military, and stopping the march of tyrants and terrorists around the globe.If we set our sights on four percent growth or higher, instead of the two percent growth of the Obama years, we can solve a whole host of challenges in America.To get there, we need to stop taxing businesses at a higher rate than any country in the Western world. We need to significantly lower corporate rates to bring jobs and investment back on shore, and to lift wages for workers.We need to dramatically cut taxes for businesses of all sizes. And we need to cut taxes on individuals and families.It’s wrong that Americans have to work two jobs just to afford the increased premiums imposed by ObamaCare, the increased housing prices spiked by big city, liberal mayors, or the increased tuition charged by Ivory Tower elites.And as America emerges as the leading energy power of the 21st century, we must legalize the export of our oil and natural gas.Thanks to President Obama, Iran will soon be able to export its energy. Maybe it is time he allowed America to do the same.If you elect me president, I will reform Wall Street and I will reform Washington.We have a lot of Washington insiders running for President. But I will suggest true change can only come in the form of an outsider, with the leadership of a governor who was not one vote out of 100, but one out of one when a bill came to his desk.We need someone not beholden to Washington interests and mega-banks to lead the country and change the culture.As someone who grew up on the prairies of West Texas, I know that the common sense of Main Street can help make Wall Street work again for all Americans, not just the well-connected few.It can be done. It will be done.If there is one thing we can learn from the 24 visionaries who met at the Buttonwood Tree, and from those who lived through the American Revolution and the Civil War and the Great Depression, it’s that America has overcome far greater obstacles than the ones we face today.America can still be that exceptional country, where nothing in life is guaranteed, but where we all have an equal opportunity to build a better life for ourselves, our children and our children’s children. Thank you — and may God bless you. ####

576,MAC,"Rep. Jeb Hensarling gives the Republican Party's Weekly Address, July 18Hello, I’m Jeb Hensarling, Congressman for the Fifth District of Texas and Chairman of the House Financial Services Committee. Five years ago this week President Obama signed into law the Dodd-Frank Act. You may not have heard of Dodd-Frank, but it’s essentially ObamaCare for our economy and your household finances.And just like Obamacare, Dodd-Frank has left us with fewer choices, higher costs and less freedom.Now, the financial crisis of 2008 and the recession that followed devastated millions of Americans. But instead of preventing the crisis, misguided Washington policies helped lead us into it — policies that either strong-armed or enticed financial institutions into loaning money to people to buy homes they couldn’t afford to keep.That was wrong.It wasn’t deregulation that caused the crisis. It was Washington’s dumb regulations.Then, and now, House Republicans have offered an alternative to Dodd-Frank that would have ended taxpayer-funded bailouts and protected consumers. But in typical Washington fashion, Democrats instead passed a 2,300-page bill that did not solve the crisis but in many ways made it worse.When President Obama signed Dodd-Frank into law five years ago with much fanfare and celebration, we were told it would ‘lift the economy,’ ‘end too big to fail’ and ‘increase financial stability.’ It didn’t happen.But, Dodd-Frank did nothing to reform Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which were at the epicenter of the crisis. It enshrined taxpayer-funded bailouts and ‘too big to fail’ into law, and it imposed 400 new burdensome, job-destroying regulations upon our economy.And the harm to consumers has been real, very real. We continue to be mired in lackluster, halting economic growth.Middle income paychecks are nearly $12,000 compared to the average post-war economic recovery. It is now harder for credit-worthy Americans to buy a home. In fact, one-out-of-five who borrowed to buy a home just five years ago will not meet the underwriting requirements of Dodd-Frank’s mortgage rules. According to the Federal Reserve, that’ll hit roughly one-third of Hispanic and African-American borrowers.Since Dodd-Frank, the big banks have gotten bigger and the small banks are now fewer. Today there are fewer community banks and credit unions serving the needs of small businesses and families. Local financial institutions tell us they can’t keep up with the sheer weight, volume and complexity of Dodd-Frank’s regulations. In fact, because of Dodd-Frank, we’re losing on average one community financial institution per day.It’s no wonder that small business deaths outnumber small business births for the first time in 35 years.It is also now more expensive for American companies to raise working capital that’s needed to grow and create jobs.Services that we all once took for granted — like free checking — are being curtailed or eliminated because of Dodd-Frank. Before, 75% of banks offered free checking. Just two years after Dodd-Frank became law, that number was cut almost in half.And bank fees have also increased due to Dodd-Frank’s costs. This has led to a rise in the number of low and moderate income Americans who simply can’t afford to maintain a checking or savings account.Not long after the financial crisis, we heard the cry from the Left to....
"
577,MAC,"....“Occupy Wall Street.” But hardworking taxpayers aren’t interested in Occupying Wall Street. They just want to quit bailing it out.Yet Dodd-Frank enshrines “Too Big to Fail” into law. It gives Washington bureaucrats the power to officially designate large financial firms “Too Big to Fail” and then makes them eligible for bailouts. That’s wrong. We have to absolutely end bailouts -- period.It is evident that Dodd-Frank has made us less prosperous and less free. It has meant lost opportunities and frustrated dreams for millions hoping to start a small business, buy a home or plan for a secure retirement. If we want strong economic growth, more freedom and an end to bailouts, it’s time we commit to making sure this anniversary is Dodd-Frank’s last anniversary.House Republicans are working to do just that. Together, we can end Wall Street bailouts, have a healthier economy, and protect consumer choice. Thanks for listening. ####Previous weekly party remarks are available here.RELATED:Obama: We need to keep pushing this countryThe candid Hillary Clinton interview you will never seeCarly Fiorina: 'Here's what I will do as Commander in Chief'

592,MAC,"Politics: Someone needs to remind Hillary Clinton that the federal government is running half-trillion dollar annual deficits and carrying $18.5 trillion in national debt.The Democratic front-runner won great applause among unions and the construction lobby when she recently announced her support for a new $275 billion program for public works projects because of ""the sorry state"" of our infrastructure.But didn't Barack Obama spend hundreds of billions of dollars on ""shovel ready"" projects as part of his stimulus program? There's no word yet from Clinton about what happened to all that money or how she'll pay for the new bricks and mortar. She is, after all, still promising not to raise taxes on families who earn less than $250,000.That promise looks more improbable in view of all the other programs Clinton wants to throw money at.Rival Bernie Sanders continues to pull her to the left, and so the cost of her ""free"" agenda keeps escalating.By our estimates, the running total tops $1 trillion, including both the direct tab to taxpayers and the mandated costs on employers. A quick tally:• Infrastructure: Besides $250 billion for new construction projects, Clinton is proposing $25 billion for a public-private ""infrastructure bank."" It would be much like a Fannie Mae for financing roads, bridges and green energy projects, and supposedly free to taxpayers. But that's what the politicians said about Fannie and Freddie Mac, which eventually required a $150 billion taxpayer bailout.• ""College affordability"": A $350 billion plan that would give students and colleges more federal dollars to make college less costly. But more money for universities has meant higher costs to families, with tuition running as high as $50,000 a year. What colleges need is not more money but more accountability.• Head Start: Clinton wants to double funding — at a cost of $10 billion over five years — for a 50-year-old program whose results have been dubious at best.• Free preschool: The cost for this new entitlement for 4-year-olds isn't specified, but a similar proposal by President Obama had a price tag of $75 billion.• Paid parental leave:""It's outrageous,"" Clinton has lamented, ""that America is the only country in the developed world that doesn't guarantee paid leave."" An independent study by the American Action Forum estimates that 16 weeks of paid parental leave, as some cities have eyed, would cost employers $306 billion to $1.9 trillion a year.• Minimum-wage hike: Clinton has on several occasions endorsed a higher minimum but hasn't specified a number. Standard Democratic proposals fall between $10.10 and $15 an hour. Even at $10.10, the cost to businesses would be an additional $75 billion in salaries, according to the Congressional Budget Office.Does anyone still think Hillary Clinton won't tax the middle class to pay for this trillion in freebies? Does she or anyone really believe she can pry all of this money out of the top 2% of taxpayers?Since most Americans in that higher income group are small business owners or investors, it's hard to see how targeting them for higher taxes will lead to more jobs.Bill Clinton ran for president as a pro-business, balance-the-budget Democrat. His wife runs so far from that agenda that her aims and those of Sanders are becoming less distinguishable by the day.The only difference is that the admitted socialist is at least honest enough to say he'll sock it to the middle class to pay for it all. Clinton won't.

""Because of the emergence of HTML5 and demand for animations that leverage Web standards, we completely rewrote the tool over the past few years to incorporate native HTML5 Canvas and WebGL support.""Adobe has been de-emphasizing Flash in favor of HTML5 for years as support for the latter has grown. Animate CC will continue to support Flash, which is still used for Web gaming and premium video, the company said.The turning point for Flash occurred in April 2010 when Apple (AAPL) CEO Steve Jobs harshly criticized the software in an open letter. He said that Flash was the No. 1 cause of Mac computer crashes and was not suitable for mobile devices because it was a battery hog. Apple refused to support Flash on its iOS devices such as the iPhone and iPad.Flash also has been knocked for security vulnerabilities.Adobe said that it changed the name of its Web animation software to reflect the importance of open Web standards and HTML5.

"
595,MAC,"Apple (AAPL) failed to live up to the lofty expectations of some investors in the June quarter, despite posting sales and earnings that beat Wall Street's targets.Unit sales of the iPhone disappointed, and Apple Watch sales appeared to be light.Apple (AAPL) stock fell 4.2% to 125.22 Wednesday. Apple late Tuesday reported its fiscal third-quarter results.Apple earned $1.85 a share, up 44.5% year over year and 4 cents ahead of Wall Street's target. Sales rose 32.5% to $49.61 billion, just above the $49.43 billion forecast by analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Apple's Q3 revenue growth was its biggest increase in over three years.What follows are five key takeaways from Apple's mixed Q3 earnings report.1. iPhone unit sales disappointIn the quarter ended June 27, Apple sold 47.53 million iPhones, an increase of 35% year over year. But on average, analysts were expecting Apple to sell 49 million to 50 million.IPhone revenue, however, rose 59% to $31.37 billion, as customers bought more higher-end models such as the iPhone 6 Plus and handsets with more flash storage. Those models carry a higher profit margin.The average selling price for an iPhone was $660 in Q3, an increase of $99 year over year, despite a significant negative foreign exchange impact, Apple CFO Luca Maestri said.The iPhone business accounted for 63% of Apple's total Q3 revenue.On a conference call with analysts, Apple CEO Tim Cook boasted that the iPhone unit sales growth last quarter was almost three times the rate of growth of the smartphone market overall. Cook also said the iPhone saw its highest rate of switchers from Google (GOOGL) Android-based smartphones that the company has ever measured.Yet the company reduced its sales channel inventory for iPhones by about 600,000 units last quarter. On the call, Cook was asked why the company reduced iPhone inventory if the product is selling so well. He said cutting iPhone supply was a prudent business decision.""We always run with just the amount of inventory that we think we need,"" he said. ""Obviously the revenue could have been much higher if we would have expanded the channel.""Apple says the outlook for iPhone sales is bright because only 27% of iPhone users have upgraded to iPhone 6 series handsets. That figure was 20% in April.""We view that as a very bullish sign on the future, that there's a lot of headroom left for upgraders,"" Cook said.In a research report Wednesday, Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi wondered whether Apple's Q3 results were ""a case of over-zealous expectations or the beginning of an inevitable slowdown.""Apple's Q3 results and guidance did not point to meaningful upside revisions ahead, Sacconaghi said. ""Moreover, investors also noted that Apple's conference call appeared less ebullient and a bit more defensive in tone than recent calls, that the company's (gross margin) beat was lower than recent quarters, and Apple did not hint at or signal any new imminent product or service introductions.""Apple also is going to face difficult comparisons with last fall's monster launch of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus starting this quarter, Mizuho Securities analyst Abhey Lamba said in a note Tuesday.""Apple's guidance seems to be supportive of our view that iPhone shipments could decelerate meaningfully in (the second half of the calendar year) with December potentially being the first quarter of year-over-year declines in iPhone shipments, which could make it tough for the stock to work,"" Lamba said.Canaccord Genuity analyst Michael Walkley says the lower-than-anticipated iPhone unit sales in Q3 and its cautious September quarter guidance are related to Apple lowering inventories ahead of the launch of the next model, the iPhone 6S.2. Apple Watch sales lightApple did not break out Apple Watch sales, but analysts dissecting the company's ""other products"" category determined that the smartwatch underwhelmed in its first full quarter.Wall Street analysts on average estimate that Apple sold 2 million to 2.5 million watches during Q3, vs. expectations for 4 million. On the high end, Deutsche Bank analyst Sherri Scribner thinks Apple sold 2.7 million Apple Watches last quarter. On the low end, UBS analyst Steven Milunovich believes Apple sold less than 2 million watches.Apple's ""other products"" category saw sales jump 49% in Q3 to $2.64 billion. Apple Watch accounted for well over 100% of the growth in the category, offsetting sliding sales of iPods and other products, Maestri said.Apple Watch sales have exceeded company expectations, despite being supply constrained, Cook said. He noted that the Apple Watch lacked a retail store presence until mid-June, which limited sales.Cook said Apple Watch sell-through was higher than the comparable launch periods of the original iPhone and the original iPad. And this was despite the fact that the Watch was only at 680 points-of-sale by quarter's end.He disputed reports that Apple Watch sales waned after the initial launch.""On the Watch, our June sales were higher than April or May,"" Cook said. ""I realize that's very different than what is being written, but the June sales were the highest. And so the Watch had more of a back-ended kind of a skewing.""Bernstein's Sacconaghi cut his forecast for Apple Watch sales in the current fiscal Q4 to 2.5 million units from 4.5 million. Apple might have to introduce a second-generation Apple Watch to drive meaningful sales during the holiday sales quarter, he said.The Apple Watch is available in 19 countries and will expand to three more countries this month. The smartwatch launched on April 24 in nine countries, including the U.S.Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Brian White said Apple Watch sales will be helped by expanded retail distribution going forward.""Apple Watch is only available at 680 points-of-sale vs. approximately 220,000 for the iPhone and 120,000 for the iPad,"" White said in a report Wednesday. ""Looking into fiscal Q4, we expect a significant ramp in the point-of-sale locations for Apple Watch.""Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster says the Apple Watch will be helped by the release this fall of the second-generation Watch operating system.That will allow for native apps on the device, which will improve the user experience.3. China a huge driver for AppleApple's growth in China remained robust, with sales more than doubling and comprising nearly 27% of total revenue in Q3.""Our results from Greater China were outstanding with revenue growth of 112% and iPhone unit growth of 87%,"" Cook said. Apple also saw healthy sales of Macs and from the App Store in China, he said.Apple's revenue in China reached $13.23 billion in Q3.Apple isn't seeing a slowdown in China despite the stock market turmoil in that country.Cowen analyst Timothy Arcuri on Wednesday lowered his rating on Apple stock to market perform from outperform and cut his price target to 130 from 140. One of the big reasons for his downgrade is because ""evidence of a widespread demand reset from China is mounting.""In his report, he cited declining auto sales in China and earnings reports from United Technologies (UTX), Fairchild Semiconductor (FCS) and Linear Technology (LLTC), among other companies.4. Services gaining steamApple's services category, which includes iTunes, AppleCare, App Store and Apple Pay, became the company's third largest business in the June quarter. It had been the fourth largest, but passed the shrinking iPad business.Services sales rose 12% to $5.03 billion. Within services, the App Store's revenue rose 24%, Cook said.The services category includes Apple's streaming music service, Apple Music, which launched in June with three-month free trials.5. Mac sales up, iPads downApple's Mac computer sales rose 9% to 4.8 million units, in line with estimates.Mac sales have consistently outperformed the overall PC industry in recent years. In the calendar second quarter, Apple was the only major PC vendor to show growth in an overall down market, market research firm IDC said. Mac shipments rose 16.1%, while the overall PC industry saw shipments fall 11.8% worldwide, IDC said.But tablet sales continued to fall in Q3. Apple iPad sales fell 18% to 10.93 million units in the June quarter. IPad sales have fallen for six straight quarters.IPad sales could get a boost from enterprise sales through Apple's partnership with IBM (IBM) and a rumored larger-screen iPad Pro, Cantor Fitzgerald's White said.

(It skipped Windows 9 in its naming scheme.) While Windows 7 was well-received by users, people generally hated Windows 8 with its redesigned user interface optimized for touchscreens.Windows 10 has received mostly favorable reviews, but Windows 7 users have largely stayed put with their 6-year-old operating system, according to data from Net Applications. In November, 56.1% of PCs on the Internet were running Windows 7, Net Applications reported Tuesday. The figure has remained stubbornly high since the Windows 10 launch. It was 57.7% in August, 56.5% in September and 55.7% in October.Meanwhile, the percentage of Windows 8 PCs in use rose last month. Windows 8 accounted for 14% of PCs on the Internet in November, compared with 13.2% in October. In June, before the release of Windows 10, Windows 8 had 16% market share, Net Applications said.In the four months since its release, Windows 10 has grown to 9% market share as of November. In October, it had 7.9% share, Net Applications said.Windows 10 adoption also has been slowed by sluggish sales of new PCs, which come with the new operating system installed.Versions of Microsoft's Windows ran 91.4% of PCs on the Internet in November, Net Applications said. Apple's (AAPL) Mac OS was second with 7% share, followed by Linux with 1.6%.On Nov. 23, market research firm Gartner (IT) predicted a fast migration to Windows 10.""In the consumer market, a free upgrade coupled with broad legacy device support and automatic over-the-air upgrades ensures that there will be tens of millions of users familiar with the operating system (OS) before the end of 2015,"" Gartner analyst Steve Kleynhans said in a statement.

"
633,MAC,"2016: If only Wall Street bankers had listened to St. Hillary during the subprime mortgage frenzy. She now claims she warned about the risky loans. Yep, a Clinton actually went there. Her campaign may regret it.While bashing Wall Street for risky acts and ""criminal behavior,"" Clinton in her first economic stump speech portrayed herself as the voice of financial sanity in a casino of wild greed.""As we all know, in the years before the crash, financial firms piled risk upon risk,"" she intoned, ""and regulators in Washington either wouldn't or couldn't keep up.""I was alarmed by this gathering storm and called for addressing the risks of derivatives, cracking down on subprime mortgages and improving financial oversight,"" she added.This is revisionism at its most shameless.For starters, Hillary never raised any subprime alarms until long after the high-risk loans began defaulting in droves, whereupon she called for loan modifications and borrower bailouts.In December 2007, she demanded a 90-day moratorium on subprime foreclosures, a five-year freeze on adjustable mortgage rates and $5 billion in aid for busted subprime borrowers. In other words, she acted long after the ""storm"" had gathered; in fact, after the damage was done. And she never ""cracked down"" on subprime loans.Truth is, Hillary was all for subprime loans before she was against them, just like her husband. Subprime lending fit into their leftist affordable housing scheme for boosting minority home ownership.In fact, their administration not only promoted subprime mortgages but even bragged about creating the subprime securities market on Wall Street. According to the book ""The Great American Bank Robbery"": When Bill Clinton took office in 1993, subprime mortgage credit was a sliver of the overall credit market; but by the time he left in 2001, it accounted for about 25% of home equity credit outstanding. The number of subprime mortgages originated by lenders soared to 997,000 by 1998 from 104,000 in 1993. Subprime mortgage activity grew an average 25% a year from 1994 to 2003, outpacing the rate of growth for prime mortgages.Regulators didn't ""keep up"" with the subprime bubble because they were too busy inflating it — on orders from Clinton.Clinton HUD secretary Andrew Cuomo, for one, plunged Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into the fringe subprime market, announcing in a 2000 HUD report, ""(Their) expanding presence in the subprime market could be of significant benefit to lower-income families, minorities and families living in underserved areas.""That same year, Clinton Treasury undersecretary Gary Gensler boasted that thanks to subprime mortgages, banks made home loans to minorities at ""twice the rate"" they made to other borrowers.""A subprime loan is a good option when the alternative is no access to credit,"" he testified, adding that ""more lower-income and minority families have the opportunity to buy homes, to refinance their debts and finance educational medical and other important expenses.""Before subprime loans bankrupted millions of minorities, Clinton's regulators were pushing banks to let them dangerously withdraw equity from those home loans and use the cash for other purchases.Another top Clinton bank regulator and Friend of Hillary, then-FDIC chief Ellen Seidman, also encouraged subprime lending in ""underserved"" communities. ""Growth in the subprime credit market indicates that credit needs in many low- and moderate-income areas are being met,"" she said in 1999.Seidman also cheered the relaxation of credit standards and the development of the subprime securities market, which without Clinton's husbandry, she said, ""would likely not have developed.""Bubba, for his part, burst forth with subprime pride by the end of his last term, braying how he used the Community Reinvestment Act to leverage banks for almost $1 trillion in subprime loan commitments for the ""underserved.""The Clintons never tried to rescue anyone from the risks of subprime lending; quite the contrary. The record shows that they are full of themselves — only because the media elite won't challenge them to own up to their share of the blame for the housing and financial crisis.Hillary in her opening campaign salvo, however, has reopened the debate.

634,MAC,"Worldwide personal computer shipments fell 11.8% year over year to 66.1 million units in the second quarter. But Apple (AAPL) defied the overall market trend and saw its Mac shipments rise 16.1% to 5.14 million units, research firm IDC said late Thursday.Apple was the only top 5 PC vendor to show an increase in shipments last quarter, IDC said. It ranked No. 4 behind Lenovo, Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) and Dell.Though they all experienced year-over-year declines in PC shipments in Q2, Lenovo, HP and Dell gained market share because their declines were less than the overall market.China-based Lenovo was tops with 20.3% market share in Q2, up from 19.4% a year earlier, IDC said. Its shipments dropped 7.5% year over year.Palo Alto, Calif.-based HP was No. 2 with an 18.5% market share, up from 18.2%. Its PC shipments fell 10.4%.Round Rock, Texas-based Dell was No. 3 with a 14.5% market share, up from 14%. Its PC shipments fell 8.7%.The PC market's year-over-year decline was 11.8%, a little more than expected, IDC said.The market faced tough year-over-year comparisons because of the surge in PC buying last year related to Microsoft (MSFT) ending support for its popular but aging Windows XP operating system, prodding many users to upgrade to newer PCs. Also, sales channels last quarter reduced their inventories ahead of the July 29 launch of Windows 10, IDC said.Plus, weaker exchange rates for foreign currencies led to increased PC prices in many markets and reduced purchasing power, IDC said.""Although the second-quarter decline in PC shipments was significant, and slightly more than expected, the overall trend fits with expectations,"" IDC analyst Loren Loverde said in a statement. ""We continue to expect low to mid-single digit declines in volume during the second half of the year, with volume stabilizing in future years.""PC shipments in the U.S. fell 3.3% to 16.4 million units, IDC said.Rival market research firm Gartner late Thursday said global PC shipments declined 9.5% to 68.4 million units. It expects PC shipments to fall 4.4% in 2015.

649,MAC,"Apple's (AAPL) prospects are looking up as the consumer electronics firm shifts from a transactional business model around selling its latest hardware to a recurring revenue model, Goldman Sachs analyst Simona Jankowski said in a report Wednesday.Jankowski added Apple to Goldman's Conviction Buy List with a price target of 163. Apple stock was up 2.6% to near 117 in afternoon trading on the stock market today.""We expect that over the next year, the focus will shift from unit growth (which is slowing given a maturing smartphone market) to installed base monetization and recurring revenues (""Apple-as-a-Service""),"" Jankowski said. ""Apple's model has already tilted that way with its new iPhone 6S installment plans, and we see the upcoming TV service as a powerful next step.""Today the market views Apple as a hardware company with a transactional business model and limited recurring revenues, she said. Its outlook extends only to the next product cycle. But with installment iPhone billing and new subscription services like Apple Music that perception is starting to change, Jankowski said.""With an estimated installed base of 500 million loyal iPhone users, we see a significant multi-year opportunity for Apple to increase monetization through (1) increased attach of services such as TV, Music, and Pay, and (2) increased attach of additional hardware such as Mac, iPad and Watch,"" Jankowski said.She calculates a current average revenue per user of $42 a month for Apple. It could grow to $150 a month or more as users add more hardware installment plans and services like Apple Music ($10 a month) and a rumored Apple TV service ($40 a month), she said.Jankowski predicts that Apple can grow its iPhone installed base to 700 million by the end of 2017.Apple is a recurring business masquerading as a transactional one, she said.""Apple has a very loyal installed user base, with more than 90% of iPhone buyers being repeat purchasers on our estimates,"" Jankowski said.Consumers could pay Apple a monthly bill for a package of services much like they do with AT&T (T) and Comcast (CMCSA), she said.RELATED:Apple iPhone winning where it counts: profits.

650,MAC,"B016: In an otherwise sensible economic debate last week, all the Republican candidates flunked the stress test on bank bailouts. Instead of pledging to end bailouts forever, they said they might do it all over again.This a big problem for the party, because the 2008 taxpayer rescue of the big banks, AIG and investment houses continues to cast a long shadow. Americans still think of the GOP as the party of corporate bailouts.Here's how John Kasich put it: ""When a bank is ready to go under, and depositors are getting ready to lose their life savings, you just don't say, 'We believe in philosophical concerns.' Philosophy doesn't work when you run something.""Ted Cruz then intervened by attacking Kasich for being in favor of bailouts. ""Why would you bail out rich Wall Street banks and not Mom and Pop?"" he asked. ""What would you do if the bank was failing?""Kasich dug the hole deeper when he sanctimoniously replied: ""I would not let the people who put their money in there all go down."" Instead he would ""separate those people who can afford it, versus those people who are the hardworking folks who put their money in those institutions. ... You've got to deal with it. You can't turn a blind eye there.""The audience roundly booed. Lesson: Voters hate bailouts.Cruz then pledged that he wouldn't ever bail out banks. Right answer. But then he retreated and said that he might let the Federal Reserve intervene in its role of lender of last resort to help the banks. That sounds suspiciously like a bailout.Even Jeb Bush whiffed by saying that he would have regulators require banks to hold more capital. This comment came only a short while after he complained about too many federal rules and pledged to abolish Obama regulation.Here's what should have been said: Bailouts were a terrible mistake and were unfair to banks that loaned out their money responsibly. The bailouts only created a ""too big to fail"" doctrine that is hurting community banks. Bailouts are the ultimate form of cronyism, because Uncle Sam doesn't bail out small businesses.And Kasich's argument that bailouts are necessary to protect the lifetime savings of depositors is spurious, because we already have FDIC deposit insurance for families.The candidates should have also condemned Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Let's not forget that they got $150 billion in bailouts — more than any private bank. These government enterprises should be privatized.Republicans should also condemn the practices of Fannie and Freddie, which are still up to their dangerous practice of insuring 3%-down-payment mortgages.Republicans should talk of how the Fed's policies of cheap money inflated the real-estate bubble and alert voters to the danger of a new Fed-induced, zero-interest-rate financial bubble that could burst.Washington intelligentsia are attempting to rewrite history by praising Ben Bernanke for rescuing the nation's finances — when these were the policies that wrecked the economy in the first place.As for Bush's idea of higher capital requirements on banks, such a rule won't stop a 2008-style meltdown. In the run-up to the 2008 banking crisis, the big banks were heavily invested in what the government eggheads proclaimed were ""safe"" mortgage-backed securities. Those toxic investments, not inadequate capital, are what caused the cascade of losses.Democrats are ready to pounce on the GOP as the party that rescues fat-cat friends while abandoning the working class. To win back the trust of millions of voters who haven't forgotten the trauma of 2008, Republicans must swear off bailouts and reestablish their credentials as the party not of corporate welfare but of free enterprise.If they don't, voters will again snuff them out as economic frauds, and Hillary Clinton will prance into the Oval Office.

666,MAC,"Social Engineering: A new ACLU study tells a ""tale of two economic recoveries for black and white homeowners"" and blames ""predatory lenders"" and ""racial discrimination"" when it should fault government.In the study, ""Impact of the U.S. Housing Crisis on the Racial Wealth Gap Across Generations,"" the ACLU accurately documents the yawning post-crisis wealth gap between blacks and whites, one that will severely disadvantage African-American homeowners perhaps for generations to come.The subprime mortgage crisis wiped out roughly half the net worth of black families — the single greatest economic blow ever delivered to this community. But the ACLU fingers the wrong culprits for the catastrophe.""Deeply rooted economic inequality fueled some of the most harmful lending practices, allowing financial institutions to engage in discriminatory and predatory lending that accelerated the financial collapse,"" the study concludes.""Looking back, it is clear that racial discrimination played a pivotal role in the housing market crash.""But looking back at all the evidence, it's clear that nothing of the kind took place. Black homeowners suffered because of big-government programs designed to benefit them. They were victims of reckless government housing policies.For a proper accounting of the history leading up to the crisis, the ACLU should consult former fellow traveler David Horowitz's ""Take No Prisoners: The Battle Plan to Defeat the Left,"" which finds ""its indisputable origins lie in actions by progressives in the Democratic Party, which in the 1970s began a campaign to make homeownership a right — as a matter of 'social justice.'""Joined by left-wing activists, they began accusing the banking industry of redlining minority neighborhoods and denying them loans on the basis of race. But no such racism existed, and there were no insurmountable obstacles to blacks obtaining loans.Data showed that blacks had much higher default rates, which indicated that, if anything, lenders were overlending in those communities.Still, the tarring let President Clinton turn the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 from a simple minority outreach effort into a strict quota system for lending in low-income minority communities.Banks that didn't lower their standards and meet the quotas were blocked from opening new branches or buying or merging with other banks.Clinton's CRA rewrite also made it easier for radical groups like Acorn to shake down banks for subprime loan commitments. ""From 1977 to 1991, subprime loans cumulatively totaled just under $9 billion. In 1992, they jumped to $34 billion,"" Horowitz wrote. ""Over the ensuing 16 years — right to the moment of the housing crash — they expanded to over $6 trillion.""The CRA was by no means the government's only hammer forcing banks to make risky race-based loans. Non-bank lenders like Countrywide were driven deep into the subprime market by HUD, which threatened legal actions against mortgage bankers and coerced them into signing pledges to meet minority needs for subprime mortgages.Through its ""affordable housing goals,"" moreover, HUD pressured Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to lower their standards and accept subprime loans and package them into securities sold on Wall Street.At the same time, the Justice Department sued banks to open lending offices in high-risk urban areas and actually ""target"" minorities for subprime loans through marketing and advertising programs. As a result, over half of black received subprime loans by 2006; and by 2008, their dreams went up in smoke.ACLU mentions none of this in its indictment of lenders for ""blacks' disproportionate exposure to predatory loans"" and their even wider mortgage gap today.This economic devastation was entirely preventable. While maddening on its own, what angers us above all else is seeing how leftists haven't learned — no, refuse to learn — from their mistakes.

670,MAC,"Higher Education: Riding a wave of politically correct outrages on campuses from coast to coast, student activists now call for ""free"" tuition and loan forgiveness. After these shenanigans? Are they kidding?The students at the University of Missouri and Yale who have whipped up student protests and intimidated college officials based on spurious claims of victimhood are the generational spawn of the radical 1960s.Egged on by an aging cohort of far-left faculty members schooled in the socialist bullying tactics of Saul Alinsky, they've intimidated two institutions of higher learning into submitting to their irrational nonsense.But it didn't end there. On Thursday, students walked out of class across the country to protest rising student loan debt and to demand free tuition.So a generation raised on ""timeouts"" and ignored misbehavior believes that it's entitled to take money from others to pursue its own future. This isn't socialism, as some think. It's ""pathological narcissism,"" as Heather Mac Donald, writing in the City Journal, calls it.And recent campus events prove it: At University of Missouri, President Tim Wolfe resigned after black football players — mostly on scholarship, mind you — threatened not to play a game due to ""systematic oppression"" on campus.As evidence, they cited alleged racial slurs and a swastika painted from feces in a dorm — though neither has been definitively proven. At campus protests, Melissa Click, an assistant communications professor, tried to keep a student journalist from covering the protests, at one point yelling for some mob ""muscle"" to stop him. At Yale, students became enraged after professors Nicholas and Erika Christakis suggested that it wasn't the university's place to tell anyone how to dress on Halloween. They were harangued for failing to provide a ""safe space"" for people of color. When they tried to explain themselves, they were shouted down, hounded by a mob and ultimately pressured to make a groveling apology to a pack of post-pubescent brats in a scene worthy of George Orwell's ""1984.""And, yes, Yale officially apologized, too.This ""PC hysteria"" has spread to other campuses, the PJ Tatler reports, including Ithaca College, University of Michigan and Vanderbilt.The dereliction of duty by officials in positions of authority is sickening, to say the least. These ""kids"" now wasting taxpayer money should be given an ultimatum: Return to class and stop disrupting learning or leave school. No third choice.Instead, they're patted on their angry little heads by fawning higher-ed officials and opportunistic leftist politicians, including socialist Bernie Sanders and Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton.For the record, a Pew Research study last year found that the average college graduate earned $17,500 a year more than the average high school grad — a difference of $700,000 over a 40-year career.So the students who now scream for free tuition and a debt-free life will get those only by raising taxes on the working class — who earn less than they ever will.Talk about income inequality. These student ""activists"" demand a privileged existence at schools that increasingly resemble resorts and that no longer teach them how to think or challenge them intellectually.Yet they don't want to pay for it or the higher standard of living it provides. They want others to pay.Sadly, their derelict parents never taught them a basic life lesson: Be grateful for all you have. Maybe it's time for taxpayers to teach that one.
"
671,MAC,"Ideology: Socialism is a lot of things, but ""entrepreneurial"" ain't one of them. That Bernie Sanders can describe it as such shows the Orwellian low our political discourse has reached.'To me, what democratic socialism is about is to maintain the strong entrepreneurial spirit that we have in this country,"" the Democrat presidential hopeful told the Wall Street Journal. ""To continue to produce wealth, but to make sure it is more equitably distributed than is currently the case.""That describes the American left's attitude toward business: We'll tax you half to death and have the government do all sorts of things that should be left to you, but don't let that keep you from making and selling things and employing people.It just doesn't work that way.President Obama is the worst offender. ""I actually believe in the free market,"" he said two summers ago as he urged that ""private capital should take a bigger role in the mortgage market."" That, Obama quipped, ""sounds confusing to folks who call me a socialist.""Then, he wanted private lenders to rescue the skewed housing market from the hopeless ""government-sponsored enterprises"" Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, whose massive subsidizing of mortgages formed the roots of the 2008 financial crisis.Similarly, government-controlled health care is a ""marketplace"" in Obama-speak. And when Joe the Plumber in 2008 told candidate Obama that higher taxes could prevent him from realizing his dream of buying the small business he worked for, Obama responded: ""Everybody's so pinched that business is bad for everybody,"" but ""when you spread the wealth around, it's good for everybody.""Left-wing politicians redistributing private wealth is believing in the free market? Governmental bureaucrats, unlike entrepreneurs, don't care when money is wasted or stolen. It isn't theirs, so they treat it as Monopoly money. How can that be good for business?Just as Obama feigns belief in the free market, Sen. Sanders tells us ""democratic socialism"" maintains America's strong entrepreneurial spirit.In his anti-Stalinist novel ""1984,"" George Orwell had the government feeding the people equally ridiculous lies: ""War is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength."" Oh yes, and socialism is entrepreneurialism.In Orwell's fictional society, the populace were so systematically oppressed that they believed every lie, no matter how absurd.The fact that Obama and Sanders think we'll so easily believe ""socialized medicine is a marketplace"" and that ""wealth redistribution helps business"" is a chilling commentary on how the free can be tricked into tyranny.

672,MAC,"Islamic State: President Obama just broke last year's promise that ""American forces will not have a combat mission"" against the Islamic State. And it's a mission he doesn't even believe in.A ""senior U.S. official"" called sending special operations ground forces against IS a ""shift"" but not a ""change"" in policy.Presumably, it's ""Shift"" We Can Believe In.Then White House spokesman Josh Earnest called it an ""expansion"" but not a ""change.""Of course, it's very much a change.Recall the president's words from a year ago in September: ""I want the American people to understand how this effort will be different from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. It will not involve American combat troops fighting on foreign soil.""He compared it to his counterterrorism strategy in Yemen, which fell apart a few weeks after the September 2014 speech as Iran-backed rebels overwhelmed the U.S.-backed government.But now, with U.S. efforts against IS obviously failing, and Russia showing us up with its intervention, Obama is sending a few dozen commandos into northern Syria.The president, of course, has a bias toward special ops, the Navy's SEAL Team Six having taken out Osama bin Laden in 2011.Earnest admitted, ""There is no denying the amount of risk they are taking on here.""And when a reporter asked on Thursday: ""The mission may not be a combat mission, but there will be instances potentially where they are in combat situations — is that accurate?"" Earnest replied, ""That is accurate.""So the big difference the president himself focused on between President Bush's wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and his war against IS is now gone, no matter how much the White House may try to candy-coat it. He is reluctantly authorizing ""American combat troops fighting on foreign soil.""He has to, after more than a year of ineffectiveness. But as House Armed Services Committee Chairman Mac Thornberry, R-Texas, commented, ""it seems the administration is trying to avoid a disaster while the president runs out the clock.""After all, if over 170,000 troops ultimately failed in Iraq, as Obama sees it, and over 130,000 failed in Afghanistan, how, under Obama, are fewer than 50 going to succeed today against IS?Obama wanted to say good riddance to U.S. involvement in Iraq and go down in history as the president who ended wars. Last year, he found he couldn't.This year, the efforts against IS he last year called ""American leadership at its best"" are failing. President Obama is discovering it takes U.S. boots on the ground to fight this mutation of al-Qaida that emerged in the wake of the Obama withdrawal.But if any of these special-ops soldiers, God forbid, return home in body bags, their families will be asking the commander-in-chief why he sent the equivalent of one platoon against a division.

673,MAC,"Advances in artificial intelligence and robotics potentially leading to a robot apocalypse have been a popular theme in Hollywood this year. Already we've seen ""Avengers: Age of Ultron,"" ""Chappie"" and ""Ex Machina"" entertain audiences with the idea of a machine uprising.Next up is ""Terminator Genisys"" starring Arnold Schwarzenegger and Emilia Clarke. The latest in the ""Terminator"" robot apocalypse movie series opens in U.S. theaters on Wednesday.Beyond the entertainment industry, British theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking and tech industry icons Bill Gates and Elon Musk have expressed worries about the dangers of AI.If the robot apocalypse is coming, the seeds of our destruction likely have already been planted. What follows is a look — mostly tongue-in-cheek — at the publicly traded companies that could play a part in the robot destruction of the human race.All of these companies are working on technologies that will benefit mankind, including smarter computers, self-driving cars and disaster response robots. But what if our robot friends suddenly decided they didn't want to serve us anymore?IBM (IBM) has been linked to the robopocalypse in the minds of the general public since ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" The classic 1968 science-fiction film featured a murderous AI computer called HAL 9000. Many people have conjectured that the name HAL was based on a one-letter shift from the name IBM.Fast-forward to today, and IBM is a leader in artificial intelligence with its Watson computer system.After defeating puny humans on the TV game show ""Jeopardy"" in 2011, Watson has tackled bigger problems in fields such as health care and oil and gas production.In January 2014, IBM created a new business unit around Watson. Around that time, IBM CEO Virginia Rometty said she wanted Watson to generate $10 billion in annual revenue within 10 years.Internet search leader Google (GOOGL) has taken a keen interest in robotics, acquiring a number of companies in the emerging field. But it's been secretive about its plans.This month, Google-owned Boston Dynamics supplied Atlas humanoid robots to six competitors in the DARPA Robotics Challenge. One took the second-place prize of $1 million after completing a simulated disaster response scenario. Looking like Terminator's bulkier cousin, the Atlas robot stands 6 feet 2 inches and weighs 345 pounds.For the DARPA contest, the Atlas robot drove a car, exited it and walked through a course performing such tasks as opening a door, turning a valve, cutting a hole in the wall and climbing a set of stairs. Those tasks will come in handy for responding to disasters like saving a crippled nuclear power plant. They also would be useful for chasing down and killing humans.Boston Dynamics is known for its scary, fast-moving, quadrupedal robots like BigDog and Cheetah, developed for the U.S. military.In addition, Google is working on self-driving cars. For the robot apocalypse to happen, bots will have to move fast and travel great distances to exterminate mankind.E-commerce giant Amazon (AMZN) has deployed an army of 15,000 robots in its warehouses to retrieve shelves full of products and bring them to fulfillment workers. It also is exploring the use of robotic arms that can pick and pack items.Plus, Amazon is experimenting with aerial drones that it hopes can one day deliver packages within minutes to your doorstep. The Amazon Prime Air drone project was announced in late 2013 and has been slowed by government regulatory hurdles.Don't go thinking drones are harmless flying machines. Ask singer Enrique Iglesias. In May, a quadcopter filming his concert in Tijuana, Mexico, slashed some of his fingers. He had to undergo reconstructive hand surgery.In December, a mistletoe drone at a TGI Friday's restaurant cut someone's nose and chin.Now drones have a taste for blood.Bedford, Mass.-based iRobot (IRBT) is best known for home robots like the Roomba vacuum cleaner. It also makes virtual-presence robots that let people tour facilities and meet face to face with others over great distances.It also makes rovers for defense and law enforcement customers. These robots conduct reconnaissance, check out unsafe buildings, and assist in bomb detection and disposal. About 5,000 such robots from iRobot are in the field. They are performing dangerous missions and keeping human soldiers and police out of harm's way.IRobot's biggest military bot is the 710 Kobra. It weighs 500 pounds and can reach as high as 11.5 feet. With its tanklike tracks, it can reach speeds of up to 8 miles per hour, can easily climb stairs and fit through doorways and aisles.It's not hard to imagine that someday robots will be armed to take out enemy combatants via remote control. One step away from robot domination.Apple (AAPL) introduced its intelligent personal assistant Siri in October 2011. The female-voiced computer program can answer spoken questions, make recommendations and perform tasks like setting your alarm clock.Apple has continued to improve the usefulness and accuracy of Siri. The program started as an app on the iPhone and has migrated to Apple Watch and soon the Mac computer.Competing programs have cropped up, such as Cortana from Microsoft (MSFT) and Google Now.Siri has a personality and is known for talking sass to users when irritated. Given advancements in AI, I wouldn't want to get her too upset.When the history of the robot apocalypse is written, after John Connor or whoever defeats our robot overlords, historians may look to blame drone manufacturers.Unmanned aerial vehicles like the Predator combat drones built by General Atomics, a privately held defense contractor in San Diego, have been critical to the U.S. war on terrorist groups in the Middle East. Other U.S. drone makers include Boeing (BA) and Northrop Grumman (NOC).These lethal drones are under human control from remote terminals. But if they become sentient, look out.If robots are ever going to be able to effectively hunt down humans, they're going to need good machine vision.Perhaps they'll use technology developed by Mobileye (MBLY). Its technology is being used for car safety systems, with an eye toward autonomous cars. Mobileye's camera-based advanced driver assistance systems are being used today by top automakers such as Audi, BMW, Chrysler (FCAU), General Motors (GM), Ford Motor (F), Honda (HMC) and Volvo.And if killer robots are going to see in the dark, they might use thermal imaging systems developed by Flir Systems (FLIR).If robots are going to take over the world, they'll need to mass-produce soldier robots.Who better to produce killer robots than industrial manufacturing robots?Leaders in industrial robots today include ABB (ABB), Fanuc, Kuka and Yaskawa Motoman.In May, ABB opened a robot-building operation in Auburn Hills, Mich., to be close to the Big Three U.S. automakers: GM, Ford and Chrysler.

677,MAC,"Policy: The heavy federal hand in the housing market has been a disaster. Despite spending more than $13,000 for every household, Washington has record low homeownership to show for it, even among the middle class.In fact, a just-released report by Harvard's Joint Center for Housing Studies not only finds more middle-class families renting but many also struggling to make rent, as homeownership rates plunge lower than ever.This is as shocking as it is depressing. It used to be that the middle class owned homes. Now it's increasingly feeling ""the strain of rising rents,"" the reports says, as foreclosures and stagnant incomes drive more Americans into apartments and home rentals.With last year's drop in the homeownership rate to just 64.5%, nearly all the gains over the previous two decades have been erased. In fact, the study says, the number of homeowners fell for the eighth straight year, and the downtrend is expected to continue.Meanwhile, this decade is shaping up to be the strongest in history for renting. And it's not just millennials fueling rental market growth . It's also the middle class.Households aged 45-64 have accounted for about twice the share of renter growth as households under 35. And households in the top half of the national income range — where you expect to find high homeownership rates — contributed a whopping 43% of the growth among renters, Harvard found.Even more troubling, ""cost burdens are climbing the income ladder, affecting growing shares of not just low-income renters but moderate- and middle-income renters as well,"" said the study, ""The State of the Nation's Housing 2015.""The cost-burdened share of renters with incomes in the $30,000-$45,000 range rose to 45% between 2003 and 2013, while 1 in 5 renters earning $45,000-$75,000 is now cost-burdened as well.The study paints an even grimmer picture for lower-income minorities, including those who held onto homes after the subprime crisis.Negative equity problems are highly concentrated in minority and low-income neighborhoods. Almost a third of black and more than a quarter of Hispanic homeowners are upside down on their mortgages vs. 16% of white and Asian owners. Home equity is a key source of household wealth, but it represents a much larger share of the typical black or Hispanic homeowner's net worth.Politicians will no doubt look at these findings and call for more federal assistance and more regulations. But that's just doubling down on failure. The Department of Housing and Urban Development alone already has spent $1.6 trillion, or more than $13,000 per household, subsidizing housing since its creation in 1965, while pressuring the mortgage industry — specifically Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac — to subsidize homeownership for low-income borrowers with weak credit.The goal was to boost homeownership and make housing more affordable for all. Only, the median price of new homes has doubled and median rents have gone up by more than a third since HUD was formed 50 years ago.Government creates devastating housing bubbles by stimulating artificial demand. We'd all be better off with less government in the housing market.

"
704,MAC,"Surprisingly, reports of the mall's demise may be greatly exaggerated. Both teens and 20-somethings still like shopping. Gen Z does 67% of its shopping in store, according to Deep Focus figures, vs. 58% of millennials. And over the last six months, 74% of Gen Zs have engaged in ""webrooming"": researching a product online but ultimately purchasing it in store.
"
705,MAC,"""This is not doom and gloom for retailers,"" said Gutfreund. ""It's human nature that people still do love the shopping experience. But those shopping experiences are going to have to be much better.""Recession-weary millennials haven't been as eager as previous generations to get saddled with possessions, a sentiment reflected in low home ownership rates and a thriving ""sharing economy."" But the newest generation of consumers likes having nice things. Generation Z — those 17 and younger — is the latest demographic in the cross hairs of brands and retailers who have thus far been in hot pursuit of millennials. But teens and kids are markedly different from their older counterparts in want and how they spend, say experts.Their predecessors in the 18-to-34 set have a case of ""millennialism,"" a recession-induced mindset that translates to owning fewer things, said Jamie Gutfreund, chief marketing officer at digital marketing agency Deep Focus.Millennials, who graduated college during a recession and witnessed their parents struggle with layoffs, aren't attached to possessions, says Gutfreund, and they see property like cars and homes weighing them down. The travel-happy renters would rather take an Uber than buy a sedan, or resell items they no longer use.Have-Nots Vs. Aspiring Haves""If you've ever spent time with someone who's lived through the Depression, they don't go back (to their old ways),"" Gutfreund told IBD. Millennials ""essentially started the sharing economy,"" valuing experiences over products.Younger people, by comparison, dream of owning cars and homes. They're characterized as being entrepreneurial, well informed and socially conscious. If today's 20- and early-30-somethings are ""have-nots,"" Gen Z members definitely aspire to be ""haves.""Six out of 10 Gen Z youth would rather have a cool product than a cool experience, while 77% of Gen Ys (millennials) would opt for a cool experience over a cool product, according to the latest edition of the Cassandra Report, a Deep Focus survey of young consumers.Millennials, who were teenagers around the time the dot-com bubble burst, think that money doesn't make the man. When they were 14 to 18, only 28% of them viewed having lots of money as an indicator of success, said the report, vs. 51% of today's 14- to 18-year-olds.""Gen Z will be the landlords and Gen Y the renters,"" said Gutfreund. ""Gen Zs view larger, more significant purchases as a solid anchor, a direct investment toward building their future, while Ys view them as an anchor holding them back from experiences (like) traveling the world, and locking them into a lifetime of debt.""Ready To Drop Serious DoughWhat does this distinction mean for retailers and makers of consumer products?While both generations are budget buyers, today's teens look for ""investment value,"" not resale value, Gutfreund said. Young and still in school, they are nevertheless ""efficient and careful consumers"" who tend to do a lot of research online before making purchases, she added.Teens and kids are therefore more willing than their older peers to drop some serious dough (or their parents' dough ) on a product that they like, even if it means having less stuff overall.

710,MAC,"Apple (AAPL) stock is burdened by concerns about iPhone sales ahead of the company's September quarter earnings report next Tuesday.Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Chris Caso on Thursday lowered his expectations for Apple ""to reflect more conservative assumptions regarding iPhone 6S and 6S Plus sell-through in second-half 2015.""However, Caso reiterated his positive rating on Apple stock with a price target of 155. Apple stock was up 1% to around 115 in afternoon trading on the stock market today.Available data suggest that initial sales of the ninth-generation iPhones are not as strong as Caso and others had expected. ""We therefore have less confidence that iPhone can post year-over-year growth off last year's tough compares,"" he said in a report Thursday.The pullback in Apple's shares recently indicates that investors no longer expect year-over-year iPhone unit sales growth in the December quarter, Caso said.Apple's fiscal fourth-quarter results will include only two days of sales for the new iPhones, compared with eight selling days for the prior year's model, the iPhone 6. The bulk of the initial iPhone 6S series sales will occur in Apple's fiscal Q1.For the September quarter, Caso continues to expect 47 million iPhone unit sales. But he cut his December quarter sales estimate to 74 million from 79 million units. His December quarter estimate points to a year-over-year unit decline of 0.6%, he said. Current consensus for fiscal Q1 is about 75 million units.He also reduced his expectations for Apple Watch and iPad sales in the holiday sales quarter.For Apple Watch, he is modeling for 5 million units in the September quarter but reduced his December quarter estimate to 5 million from 7 million units.For iPad, he trimmed his December quarter sales estimate to 16.5 million units from 17 million. That's well below the consensus of about 19 million iPad sales, he said.Sterne Agee CRT analyst Rob Cihra believes that Apple stock has been oversold because of negative sentiment around iPhone sales comparisons.""Investors have gotten spooked by various negative tidbits out of Apple's supply chain, but we find that ironic since our own inputs make us believe that vs. weakness virtually everywhere else, Apple rather remains about the only strong supply chain out there these days,"" Cihra said in a report Wednesday.Cihra maintained his buy rating on Apple stock with a price target of 150.He believes that Apple will sell 77 million iPhones in the December quarter, up 3% year over year. Cihra is forecasting iPhone sales to rise 5% in fiscal 2016, when many see a decline.For the September quarter, Cihra is modeling for Apple to sell 49 million iPhones, up 25% year over year. He sees the company selling 4.5 million Apple Watch units, 10 million iPads (down 16%) and 5.7 million Mac computers (up 3%) in its fiscal Q4.The move to large-screen iPhones, which started with last year's iPhone 6, is only halfway done, Cihra said.RELATED:Apple sweetens video lineup ahead of Apple TV 4 debut.Apple Music growth a wake-up call for Spotify.Apple analysts clash over iPhone Upgrade Program impact.

711,MAC,"Election '16: Donald Trump charges that President George W. Bush ""knew in advance"" of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Promoting the Obama birther conspiracy was bad enough, but this is beyond the pale.There may not be a historical precedent to a major presidential candidate accusing his own party's last president of knowingly allowing an enemy to attack America, killing thousands. Negligence bordering on treason: This is the charge Donald Trump is making against George W. Bush.Trump told CNN on Tuesday, ""George Tenet, the CIA Director, knew in advance that there would be an attack, and he said so to the president.""What the intelligence reports of Tenet's CIA actually told Bush was that al-Qaida was plotting terrorist attacks, but neither Tenet nor Bush knew how or when any such attacks would take place.It is true, as Trump mentioned, that the relationship was dysfunctional between federal agencies who should have been helping each other, especially the CIA and the FBI. But the blame for this goes to Bill Clinton and his attorney general, Janet Reno.Her July, 1995 ""Procedures for Contacts Between the FBI and the Criminal Division Concerning Foreign Intelligence and Foreign Counterintelligence Investigations,"" known as ""the Wall,"" the purpose of which was to prevent Watergate-style abuses of power, had the effect of preventing anti-terrorist agents in different agencies from communicating with one another.As the Manhattan Institute's Heather Mac Donald wrote in City Journal in 2002, ""Collaboration broke down almost completely. Says Mary Jo White, former New York U.S. attorney and the most seasoned al-Qaida prosecutor before 9/11: 'The walls are the single greatest danger we have blocking our ability to obtain and act on (terrorist) information.'""""We absolutely were unable to check people out,"" Mac Donald quoted an angry James Kallstrom, who headed the FBI's New York office. ""Morale plummeted,"" Mac Donald wrote. FBI agents ""put signs on their desks saying: 'You may not talk to me.'""It was in this context that, only seven months into the Bush administration in August 2001, Minneapolis FBI agents were denied permission to conduct a search on 9/11 conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui, and a New York FBI agent was refused a search request on al-Qaida operative Khalid al-Mihdhar, one of the American Airlines Flight 77 hijackers who attacked the Pentagon.The rationale for the refusal in the latter case was that al-Mihdhar was wanted as a foreign terrorist, not a domestic felon.Both were leads that could have foiled the 9/11 plot.You would expect a Republican presidential candidate to critique the Democrat president on whose watch such crippling, politicized regulations were imposed.But Trump instead — like President Obama, and countless Democrats in Congress — finds a way to ""Blame Bush"" for yet another thing.Statements like this are what lead some to wonder whether Trump is a stalking horse for Hillary Clinton — to whom he contributed generously in 2002, 2005, 2006 and 2007. Trump has also given $100,000 to the Clinton Foundation, and Hillary even attended Trump's latest wedding in 2005.A report published Monday by the Hispanic Council charges that Trump's presidential candidacy is helping the Democratic party by portraying the GOP as radicalized.""Hispanics are the community Trump has attacked most since he launched his campaign. That's a very important fact, taking into account that this is a community whose support is vital for winning the White House in the next elections,"" according to the report.If the choice next year is between a crook Democrat and a kook pretending to be a Republican, whom will voters choose? We bet it will be the ethically challenged over the mentally questionable.

729,MAC,"Apple (AAPL) sought to reassert a leadership position in the music industry on Monday by announcing its wide-ranging Apple Music offering. But investors weren't too jazzed.Apple stock fell 0.7% on Monday and was flat, near 128, in afternoon trading on the stock market today. Apple stock had fallen as much as 1.7% earlier Tuesday.Apple dominated music sales for years with its one-two punch of iPod and iTunes. But as music listening shifted from songs purchased from iTunes to streaming music services like Spotify and Pandora (P), Apple's influence waned.Apple Music cobbles together various types of music offerings into one app. It combines downloaded music from iTunes, a rebranded subscription streaming music service (formerly Beats Music), a global 24-hour live Internet radio station and a social network for fans to connect with artists.Apple announced the new music service at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference in San Francisco.At its opening keynote presentation, Apple executives also announced iOS 9, Mac OS X El Capitan and WatchOS 2, the latest operating systems for its mobile devices (iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch), Mac computers and the Apple Watch, respectively.Here are five key takeaways from Apple's WWDC 2015:1. Apple Music 'not groundbreaking'Famed record producer Jimmy Iovine, who joined the company when Apple bought Beats Electronics last August, described the consumer music experience today as a ""fragmented mess."" He said Apple Music will unify streaming music, downloaded music, Internet radio and social media into a ""bigger and better ecosystem with the elegance and simplicity that only Apple can do.""Iovine drew parallels to 2003 when the music industry was a ""ball of confusion"" because of peer-to-peer song sharing through Napster and other services. Apple launched the iTunes Store in April 2003 to give consumers a better way to get digital music.Iovine said Apple Music is ""all the ways you love music all in one place.""Apple Music includes music channels curated by experts and a 24/7 radio station called Beats 1 that is dedicated to music and music culture.Apple Music will launch in more than 100 countries on June 30 and cost $9.99 a month.But some Wall Street analysts were skeptical that Apple Music could gain much market share.Pacific Crest Securities analyst Andy Hargreaves said in a research note that the features of Apple Music are ""not groundbreaking"" when compared with established streaming music services. Therefore it is not likely to draw new customers into the market and will have to try to draw users from rival services, he said.Edison Investment Research analyst Richard Windsor concurred in a report.""The user experience looks no better than anything offered by Spotify, Pandora or Rdio,"" Windsor said. ""Furthermore, all of these companies have a huge head start on Apple, and Apple will have to convince users to switch rather than try music streaming for the first time. This is a much more difficult proposition to make.""Plus, unlike Spotify, Apple Music doesn't offer a free tier of service, which could make attracting users difficult, he said.2. Apple Pay expanding fastApple is working quickly to expand the reach of its mobile payments service, Apple Pay.Apple will make Apple Pay available to customers in the U.K. starting next month, its first international market after launching Apple Pay in the U.S. last October.Apple also is adding support for store-issued credit and debit cards as well as retail rewards programs. Plus, it will bring support for Discover credit cards this fall.""We have been hard at work on our goal of replacing the wallet,"" Jennifer Bailey, vice president of Apple Pay, said at the event. ""We will surpass 1 million locations accepting Apple Pay next month.""Apple Pay will launch in the U.K. with over 250,000 locations, she said. By comparison, it launched in the U.S. last fall with 200,000 locations.Apple Pay has been adding more merchants, with some of the latest including Trader Joe's, Baskin Robbins and JCPenney (JCP). Plus, Apple is looking to add more small businesses through a partnership with Square.A report last week by Reuters threw cold water on the growth of Apple Pay, saying many merchants remain skeptical about the payment system.3. News app makes headlinesApple hopes to turn the iPhone into the front page for digital news consumers with its News app.With the News app, iPhone and iPad users will be able to customize a news stream by publisher and topic. Apple already has signed up nearly 20 major publishers including Bloomberg, CNN, Conde Nast, ESPN, Hearst, the New York Times and Time. Plus, News keeps track of more than 1 million topics that users can follow.""We think this offers the best mobile reading experience ever,"" said Susan Prescott, Apple vice president of application product management, at WWDC.The News app will be included with iOS 9, due out this fall. It features the visually rich layout of a magazine, Prescott said. The app will roll out first in the U.S., U.K. and China.Apple is one of several companies competing to be the news service for millennials. Others include Facebook (FB), Flipboard, Google (GOOGL) and Twitter (TWTR).Craig Federighi, Apple's senior vice president of software engineering, took a shot at rivals in digital news delivery.""Unlike just about any other news aggregation service we're aware of on the planet, News is designed from ground up with your privacy in mind,"" he said.Apple also hopes to differentiate its offering by the scope of content.""News isn't just for the media titans. Great content comes from all kinds of sources and we want them all in News,"" Federighi said at the event. ""So, whether it's a local newspaper or blog or special interest publication, they'll all be here.""4. Siri is getting betterApple's personal assistant software Siri is getting better at understanding its users.""Siri has quietly become incredibly popular,"" Federighi said. ""It serves over a billion requests per week. This is in part because Siri has gotten so great at understanding what we're saying. In just the last year, we've seen a 40% reduction in word error rate, down to 5%. That's an industry-leading number. And Siri is 40% faster than ever at responding to what we say.""Apple is bucking up Siri's capabilities in iOS 9, Federighi said. It will respond to more commands and become proactive. It will understand the context of where you are and what you're doing when you make requests or start activities, he said.Improvements to Siri are the most important feature of iOS 9, Global Equities Research analyst Trip Chowdhry said in a report Tuesday.5. Developers are criticalSince the WWDC is a conference for software developers, Apple played to its audience.It showed a flattering video depicting how app developers for Apple's iPhone and iPad are changing the world.Apple CEO Tim Cook said the company's three operating systems: iOS, Mac OS X and WatchOS will provide amazing opportunities for developers.""There's really so many possibilities for you to use these platforms and these tools to create unbelievable apps that will impact business, health care and education and really everything in our lives. There's seemingly no limit to what you can do,"" he said.Apple's App Store is key for developers, Cook said. The App Store recently passed 100 billion apps downloaded. He called Apple's App Store ""an economic boon"" that has paid out $30 billion to developers.""The App Store continues to be the most profitable apps marketplace on the planet,"" Cook said.The biggest applause at the keynote came when Apple announced that it would make its Swift programming language open source for iOS, Mac OS X and Linux later this year.""We think Swift is the next big programming language, the one that we will all be doing application and systems programming on for 20 years to come,"" Federighi said. ""We think Swift should be everywhere and used by everyone. And so we're going to be doing something really big: Today we're announcing that Swift will be open source.""The crowd of programmers at the Moscone Center went wild with cheers, whistles and clapping.Apple's decision to make Swift open source could expand Apple's developer community to 8 million from the current 5 million, analyst Chowdhry said.

784,MAC,"The Obama administration is now putting the finishing touches on a raft of environmental regulations due in the coming months, including the Clean Power Plan and others that will drastically impact the affordability of energy in America.Yet while the president and his supporters speak benevolently of protecting the health and welfare of Americans, these regulations will achieve exactly the opposite.The obvious impact of these regulations is the higher electricity costs it will impose on all Americans. The Clean Power Plan is expected to hike electricity rates by up to 17% nationwide — and over 20% in some states.As these costs continue rising and eating into households' disposable income, it will threaten increasingly more families with the prospect of government-imposed energy poverty.But that's still not the worst news. Worse still is that the populations at the highest risk of this outcome also happen to be among the least able to combat it: Seniors living on fixed incomes — who comprise one-quarter of the nation's households — and the poor.Hurting The PoorA number of recent studies bear this out.The 60 Plus Association recently found that the average annual electric bill for senior households was $1,164, representing over 60% of total residential energy costs.The study also found that these energy costs are most adversely impacting lower-income seniors afflicted by health conditions, leading them to forego food for a day, reduce medical or dental care and fail to pay utility bills.Unfortunately, these seniors aren't the only ones facing the very real prospect of energy poverty under the president's new regulatory framework.For low-income Americans already treading water in the Obama economy, these new regulations may lead to their drowning.A look at several states shows the direness of the predicament. Families earning under $10,000 annually are forced to spend a staggering portion of their after-tax income on energy bills.South Carolina is the highest at 79%, followed closely by Mississippi (77%), Texas (75%), Pennsylvania (72%), and Colorado (72%). For these families, an additional 20% in their electricity costs is no simple inconvenience — it could be the difference between making rent or living on the streets.Minorities Hit HardOther studies abound showing the true regressive nature of the president's regulatory scheme. Analyzing the disproportional impact the regulations would have on Ohio's low-income and African-American populations, the Pacific Research Institute found that these households would be the hardest hit, with the cost of electricity accounting for over one quarter of household incomes.Contrast that with the effect on more affluent Ohio households whose costs would rise from 0.8% to just 1.1% of their incomes. The study went on to conclude that the regulations will exacerbate the economic challenges confronting African-American families, inevitably pushing more families into energy poverty.Thus, far from protecting the health and welfare of all Americans as the president has promised, his climate change agenda is threatening the well-being of millions. The cold, hard truth is that our most vulnerable citizens could find the costs of basic necessities out of reach.The new Republican Congress should move quickly to avert this possibility and halt this destructive agenda. Zimmerman is policy director of Americans for Prosperity.

812,MAC,"Rep. Mac Thornberry gives the Republican Party's Weekly RemarksHello, I’m Mac Thornberry. I’m privileged to represent the people of the Panhandle and North Texas in Congress and to chair the House Armed Services Committee.In my job I get to spend a lot of time around the men and women who serve our nation in the military. I’m continually in awe of their character, their courage, and their dedication to our country.  (Scroll down for video of these remarks.)Since the beginning, the United States has been blessed with outstanding individuals who cared about something bigger than themselves and have fought — and some even died — for American security and American freedom.This Memorial Day, we continue to mark the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II. The Greatest Generation took on one of the greatest evils the world has ever known, defeated it, and came home to build a nation.But their achievement came at a heavy price. On Memorial Day, all of us should take time to remember and to honor those who sacrificed their lives in answering the call of our country.I think we have to do more than honor the fallen, however. We have a duty to honor what they fought for, so that, in the words of Lincoln at Gettysburg, “We here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain.”The world today is full of turmoil. Freedom and decency are still under assault. ISIS, for example, poses a grave and direct threat to our security and our way of life. No one knows how to solve all the problems of the world. But one thing we do know for sure — the world is a safer, better place when the United States is militarily strong.And a weakened America invites greater danger.The Constitution endows Congress with specific responsibilities to help “provide for the common defense.” For 53 straight years, Congresses of both parties have passed and presidents of both parties have signed into law a defense authorization act, which has helped to build that military strength that we need.The House passed this year’s bill last week. It gives our troops a raise and updates their benefits. It eases our war-fighters’ transition to the VA and it makes sure we get the most value possible for the taxpayer dollars. The Senate will take up their version soon.The House bill authorized exactly the amount the president requested to keep America safe. But he wants more money for domestic programs and has threatened to veto the defense bill unless he gets it.Look, we’re always going to have our differences, but it’s wrong for anyone to play politics with defense. The world is too dangerous, and the men and women who serve are too precious for that.We carry a debt to those who have served, and especially to those who have fallen, to focus just on doing what’s right for the country and what’s right for our troops. And we honor them best by building on their sacrifice to pass along to the next generation a country even stronger, even more prosperous, and even freer than we’ve enjoyed.Of course, no one put it better than Ronald Reagan when he said, “and we owe them something…We owe them a promise to look at the world with a steady gaze and, perhaps, a resigned toughness, knowing that we have adversaries in the world and challenges and the only way to meet them and maintain the peace is by staying strong.”When this Memorial Day’s passed, there will still be brave Americans stationed all over the world to protect us and our way of life. To everyone who wears America’s colors and to everyone who ever has, and to their families, thank you. ####Previous weekly party remarks are available here.RELATED:10 questions you won't hear Hillary Clinton answerOur new normal: Ramadi falls, Obama golfs, Clinton chit-chatsObama White House declares war against ISIS a 'success,' but for whose side?

846,MAC,"The regulator of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae plans to ease annual restrictions on their apartment mortgage business to prevent a lending slowdown, according to two people familiar with the matter.
"
847,MAC,"The government-controlled companies, which buy and guarantee mortgages, are on track to reach a $30 billion annual cap in their multifamily business in the third quarter. The Federal Housing Finance Agency intends to tell the companies this week how it will loosen the limits it set in January, the two sources said.Without an easing of the restrictions, Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FMCC) could have to hold back business in the second half of the year, resulting in higher costs to borrowers and less available multifamily credit. Fannie might also have to slow sales of loans to investors. The firms have begun demanding wider interest rate spreads in an attempt to reduce their pace of business.""Our sense is that the current situation is unsustainable as the lack of market clarity will ultimately have an impact on multifamily credit availability,"" said Isaac Boltansky, a policy analyst at Compass Point Research & Trading.Housing officials in the last month discussed several options for relaxing limits, including raising caps by $5 billion for each firm, said one of the sources, and they have considered broadening criteria to exempt more mortgages from the limit.FHFA spokeswoman Stefanie Johnson declined to comment.Lending SurgeFannie and Freddie's apartment business surged fourfold through April from a year ago, spurred by low interest rates and rental-unit demand. Freddie financed $10 billion in multifamily loans in Q1, just behind rival Fannie with $10.4 billion.The FHFA would be in uncharted territory if it makes changes to the mortgage limits midyear rather than in January, said Lisa Pendergast, an analyst at Jefferies Group.""It would be unusual for them to think about raising the caps now, but on the other hand, by summer, they could hit the ceiling,"" she said. ""They may have to shut down origination if that happens.""Increasing RatesFannie and Freddie began tapping the brakes by boosting their costs of borrowing, which may cause business to move to private lenders, says Willy Walker, CEO at Walker & Dunlop (WD), one of the firms' biggest multifamily lending partners.""Freddie and Fannie got ahead of themselves, and now they're trying to temper themselves by raising their rates,"" Walker said.Freddie increased the cost on its 10-year mortgage four times in April, according to Walker & Dunlop data. Freddie's floating-rate loan cost 62 basis points more by the end of the month, the firm said.Fannie also made its loans more expensive. Spreads on its 10-year mortgage rose a total of 45 basis points in late March through April.Commercial mortgage lending is booming as demand for rental units fuels multifamily construction. Total lending surged 49% in Q1 from last year, according to Mortgage Bankers Association data. Multifamily mortgages lifted 71%.""Everyone in this market will do more this year,"" Jeffery Hayward, head of multifamily lending at Fannie Mae, said in an interview.CBRE Group (CBG) said last week that the firm's multifamily lending backed by the agencies has been robust. CBRE CFO James Groch warned on the company's April earnings call that business could taper off toward the end of the year unless the caps are raised.A slowdown in multifamily agency mortgages would be a positive development for the private market, according to Lea Overby, an analyst at Nomura Holdings.

848,MAC,"Mall operator Macerich (MAC) on Tuesday said its board unanimously turned down a $22.4 billion unsolicited takeover bid made last week by Simon Property Group, saying the offer undervalued the company as Macerich focuses on its luxury shopping centers.The company's board also adopted a classified board structure and a stockholder rights plan that are intended to shield investors and the company from ""coercive takeover attempts,"" Macerich said.Shares of Macerich, which is among the biggest U.S. mall owners, fell 3% on the stock market today. Simon Property Group (SPG) dipped 0.8%.Macerich stock broke out of a flat base on March 9, the day Simon, the nation's largest mall owner, made its offer public. That announcement followed an earlier rejection from Macerich, according to Bloomberg.The takeover attempt comes amid efforts by mall operators to horde more-lucrative, higher-end properties as they become available.Simon, a real estate investment trust like Macerich, has been trying to get its hands on upscale malls in the so-called ""Class A"" camp. Those have performed better amid economic uncertainty and consumer migration toward online retailers and away from aging malls that in previous decades made their money targeting a broad swath of shoppers.In rejecting the bid, Macerich CEO Arthur Coppola said in a statement that Simon failed ""to reflect the full value of our portfolio of unique and irreplaceable assets and our positive growth prospects.""""Over the past two years,"" he continued, ""we have transformed Macerich's portfolio by selling lower quality malls to fund our highly value-accretive development pipeline. By focusing on Class-A properties ... we have built a robust portfolio that is extremely attractive to retail partners looking to grow in key fortress locations and outlet venues.""Macerich also argued that it was unable to get a clear sense of just how profitable Simon was, saying Simon didn't break out results from its mall and outlet holdings.In addition, Macerich said it plans to spend $400 million to $500 million annually ""on development and redevelopment opportunities.""

885,MAC,"CNBC is reporting that home ownership is at its lowest rate in 25 years. Given all the government initiatives designed to increase homeownership, how can this be?Through the Community Reinvestment Act, signed into law by Jimmy Carter, then given sharper teeth by Bill Clinton, government enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and various other efforts, including tax policy, Washington has encouraged homeownership as if it were a virtue that none could live without. The campaign has been a colossal failure.In the first quarter of this year, the homeownership rate fell to 63.7%. It had not been that low since 1990.When Clinton changed rules in the CRA in 1995 to make it easier for more Americans to own their own houses, the homeownership rate was about 65%. From there it climbed steadily to 2004, where it peaked beyond 69%. Then began the steady fall downward, through the meltdown of 2008, to its current low.For all the effort made and all the pain that was spun out of that wreck, we're right back where we started. At least in homeownership. The economy still hasn't recovered.One man can't be blamed for the entire financial crisis, but one man is to blame for a good portion of the mess. Maybe his intentions were pure, but the miserable outcome was consistent with most attempts by government to do good.

"
888,MAC,"Subprime Redux: Affordable-housing advocates have a new charge against lenders: They're stingy, if not racist, and ""deprive"" millions of poor minorities home loans. But it's just another ploy to loosen loan standards.The administration is using a new Urban Institute study to argue that mortgage lenders have ""robbed"" first-time minority homebuyers of 4 million mortgages that otherwise would have gone to them had underwriting standards not been so ""tight.""Aside from the fact that the study is flawed, new lending data show credit standards for first-time homebuyers are historically loose.In fact, borrowers with weak credit profiles are having little problem buying homes, thanks to Federal Housing Administration and now Federal Housing Finance Agency pressure on lenders and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to ""expand the credit box.""The housing-rights crowd is simply up to its old tricks.The Urban Institute report asserts that if the ""cautious"" standards of 2001 had been in place rather than the more ""severe"" standards of the past five years, lenders would have made more than 4 million additional loans.""African-American and Hispanic families have been particularly affected by this tight credit environment,"" the authors say. But the Urban Institute's assertion that today's lenders aren't providing money to those with less-than-perfect credit is an urban legend. Fact: 40% of home-purchase borrowers in 2013-2014 had less than perfect credit (perfect being no late payments), according to the National Mortgage Risk Index. Fact: The median FICO consumer credit rating for first-time buyers fell to 705 in March, from a high of nearly 720 in 2012, and below the median of 713 for all individuals with a score. Fact: The median FICO score for first-time buyers using Federal Housing Administration loans was an even lower 671 in March. Almost 40% of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac loans have a total debt-to-income ratio of greater than 38%, up from 14% in 1990, according to the National Mortgage Risk Index. FHA has a large share of mortgages with a total debt-to-income ratio above 50%, an extremely high pre-tax payment burden. FHA promotes lending to very high-risk borrowers: FICO-score floors of 500 with a 10% down payment and 580 with 3.5% down.""Credit standards for first-time buyers are not tight,"" said Ed Pinto, who runs the National Mortgage Risk Index for the American Enterprise Institute in Washington. ""The Urban Institute study is fatally flawed.""""FICO distribution was the same in 2005 as in 2001, so the number of 'missing' loans would be the same using either year as the baseline,"" Pinto explained. ""But 2005 was a bubble year, which makes the notion of missing loans meaningless.""The 17-page study also acknowledges that ""the number of loans to African-American families declined the most because the FICO distribution within this group is the most skewed to lower-credit-score borrowers.""And those borrowers' credit scores dropped even lower after the wave of defaults and foreclosures, making it harder for them to qualify for loans.There's also been a decline in demand for homeownership since the crash. More potential homeowners are choosing to rent instead.And lending has not declined for all minorities. Though African-American and Hispanic borrowers took out fewer loans, the number of loans to Asians increased. Why? Because they maintained the best FICO credit scores of any group, including whites.The national mortgage underwriting trend is toward loosening, not tightening, of credit for homebuyers of all colors. But it's never enough for liberals, who think homeownership is a ""right.""

889,MAC,"Apple (AAPL) stock jumped to a record high Tuesday, a day after the company reported March-quarter earnings that pulverized Wall Street expectations. But shares soon dipped into the red on growth concerns for the company's core iPhone business.The Cupertino, Calif.-based company late Monday said it earned $2.33 a share in its fiscal second quarter ended March 28, up 40% year over year and 17 cents better than what Wall Street was targeting. Apple posted sales of $58.01 billion, up 27% and beating the consensus analyst forecast for $56.08 billion.Apple's gross profit margin was 40.8% in Q2, compared with 39.9% in the December quarter and 39.3% in the March quarter last year.For the June quarter, Apple forecast sales of $47 billion at the midpoint of guidance, in line with Wall Street. It also expects a gross profit margin of 38.5% to 39.5%.Apple also increased its cash return program by more than 50%. Under the expanded program, Apple plans to spend $200 billion in cash for stock buybacks and dividends by the end of March 2017. Apple increased its share repurchase authorization to $140 billion from the $90 billion level announced last year and boosted its quarterly dividend by 11%.Apple stock rose 1.4% to a new high of 134.54 in early trading on the stock market today. But shares soon retreated and were fractionally lower in early afternoon trading.1. iPhone drives Apple's businessApple sold 61.2 million iPhones in the March quarter, beating even the most optimistic forecasts. Wall Street was counting on sales of 58 million units.IPhone unit sales were up 40% year over year. By comparison, the total smartphone market saw unit sales rise 16% last quarter.""We're seeing fantastic results for iPhone, with revenue growth of 55% year on year,"" Apple CEO Tim Cook said on a conference call with analysts. ""And we're seeing a higher rate of switchers than we've seen in previous iPhone cycles.""Apple's iPhone is attracting customers who previously used Google (GOOGL) Android-based smartphones.The iPhone is doing especially well in emerging markets where unit sales rose 63% year on year, Cook said. IPhone revenue in China soared 70%.The iPhone accounted for 69% of Apple's revenue in Q2, same as in Q1.Apple estimates that about 20% of iPhone users have upgraded to iPhone 6 series handsets, so there's more room for growth.But several Wall Street analysts raised caution flags.Sales could lose steam as the pent-up demand for bigger-screen smartphones is served, some say.""We think iPhone sales are likely to decelerate meaningfully over the next few quarters creating headwinds for the stock,"" Mizuho Securities analyst Abhey Lamba said in a research report. ""There is a good chance that iPhone unit sales and total revenues could post year-over-year declines in the December 2015 quarter.""That would mark the first ever year-over-year drop in iPhone sales, he said. Lamba rates Apple stock as neutral, with a price target of 125.Pacific Crest Securities analyst Andy Hargreaves agrees.""The current level of upgrade activity and the current pace of share gains are likely to wane as the (iPhone) 6 cycle progresses and are not likely to be repeated in the next iPhone cycle,"" he said in a note. ""This seems very likely to lead to a decline in fiscal 2016 iPhone unit sales and revenue.""Hargreaves rates Apple stock as sector weight with a 12-month fair value of 133.2. iPad sales keep on shrinkingApple's iPad business had another rough quarter.It sold 12.6 million tablets, down 23%. IPad revenue sank 29% to $5.4 billion, or 9% of total sales.IPad sales are being cannibalized by the large-screen iPhone 6 handsets. But the company's enterprise partnership with IBM (IBM) should help reinvigorate sales as more business apps are developed for the tablet, FBR Capital Markets analyst Daniel Ives said in a report Tuesday.3. Mac sales defy overall PC market declineWhile the overall personal computer business is struggling, Apple's Mac continues to sell well.Apple sold nearly 4.6 million Macs in the quarter, up 10%. Meanwhile, the overall PC market saw unit shipments fall 6.7% last quarter, research firm IDC reported. PCs running Microsoft 's (MSFT) Windows operating system are dropping as customers wait for Windows 10, due out this summer.4. Apple Pay is gaining steamApple's mobile payment service, Apple Pay, continues to expand its reach.""We're seeing great momentum with Apple Pay,"" Cook said.Discover Card plans to support Apple Pay for contactless payments this fall. Meanwhile, the number of retailers accepting Apple Pay is climbing rapidly. Best Buy (BBY) will accept Apple Pay in all of its U.S. stores later this year.Locations that accept Apple Pay now stand at 700,000, up from 200,000 in October.""And merchants aren't the only ones jumping onboard,"" Cook said. ""Earlier this month, a leading health care payment network announced acceptance of Apple Pay for its clients. So over 50 major hospitals across the country, including Stanford Healthcare and Aspen Valley, will accept Apple Pay this year for co-pays and bill payments at registration and check in.""5. 'Other products' category decliningThe outperformance of iPhone is offsetting declines in the iPad and other products at Apple.Apple's iPhone, Mac and services business (iTunes, App Store, Apple Pay) are growing revenue, but the company's iPad and ""other products"" business are seeing year-over-year declines.""Other products"" includes iPod, Apple TV, Beats Electronics and Apple-branded and third-party accessories. The category saw sales fall 10% to $1.69 billion in Q2, missing the Street's estimate of $1.91 billion, FBR's Ives said.

955,MAC,"Subprime Redux: In separate new reports to Congress, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac reveal Obama regulators are pressuring them to back high-risk home loans for ""very low-income"" borrowers. Here we go again.Both mortgage giants report that to meet new ""affordable housing"" quotas set and enforced by the administration, they have had to ""relax underwriting standards"" — including permitting late payments, higher debt ratios and ""unemployment benefits as source of income."" They've also been forced to accept mortgages with as little as 3% down.""These loans do not perform as well,"" Fannie warns in its 2014 Annual Housing Activities Report.No kidding. But Fannie and Freddie are under the gun to ease underwriting standards if the standards ""yield disparate results based on the race of the borrower.""Fannie even exceeded two of its five 2014 affordable housing benchmarks. The now-government-controlled company's purchase of mortgages made in low-income minority areas made up almost 16% of its portfolio, while its acquisition of low-income refinance loans accounted for almost 27%.Meanwhile, Freddie surpassed three of its 2014 goals.Fannie notes that to help meet the low-income home-refinancing purchase goal monitored by its new regulator, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, it ""allowed lenders to use unemployment benefits as source of income."" It also killed various restrictions on minimum down payments, household debt and delinquencies.For its part, Freddie said that it ""expanded our affordable lending in an effort to increase borrower access to mortgage credit"" by, among other methods, ""raising the maximum monthly debt payment-to-income ratio for manually underwritten mortgages from 43% to 45%.""Of course, these are the things that they've published doing to appease their masters in the Obama regime. They've probably gone much further than this to capture the riskier pool of borrowers — the so-called ""underserved"" — that the regime wants them to serve.These same political goals are what plunged the toxic twins into the subprime market before the crisis and led to their bankruptcies. Only now they're even more reckless. Obama's regulators have removed the ""moderate-income"" tranche and now exclusively mandate ""low-income"" and ""very low-income"" mortgage purchases.Worse, the FHFA proposes even tougher rules for 2015-2017. Mortgage quotas for low-income minority areas will hit 14% from 11%, while the low-income refinancing goal will shoot up to 27% from 20%.If you think these mandates will settle down when Obama leaves office, think again. FHFA chief Mel Watt's five-year term doesn't expire until 2019. And the former Congressional Black Caucus leader has a long history of pushing Fannie and Freddie into making loans to the uncreditworthy.Watt has never liked traditional underwriting standards and seeks to expand the credit box to include homebuyers who don't have the income or credit to qualify for a home loan, even those who already have an extremely high debt burden. In other words, people who really can't afford a home.But Watt doesn't care. He only cares about ""racial equity"" in homeownership.This is an ominous trend. The government is once again pushing the mortgage industry down a risky and dangerous path.According to the American Enterprise Institute's National Mortgage Risk Index, default risk levels for mortgages backed by Fannie and Freddie hit new highs in February. Almost 40% of Fannie and Freddie loans now have a debt-to-income ratio greater than 38%, up from only 14% in 1990. Mortgage risk hot spots include California's Central Valley and Inland Empire.Fannie and Freddie have a seller network of lenders numbering in the thousands. Any changes they make in their requirements for mortgage purchases effectively reset the underwriting standards for the entire mortgage industry.And when they sneeze, the entire industry catches cold.

956,MAC,"Election '16: With typical gall, Hillary Clinton in her campaign launch lit into ""those at the top"" for ""stacking"" the deck against middle-class families when in fact they are buried under the house of cards built by her husband.Earth to Hillary: It wasn't the richest 1% or Wall Street bankers who crashed the economy and created the financial wreckage from which working Americans ""have fought"" to dig themselves out of. No, that path to destruction was set by Bill Clinton and his social housing policies.The evidence is overwhelming that Clinton was the architect of the financial disaster that wiped out trillions of dollars in household wealth. Under his National Homeownership Strategy, Clinton took more than 100 executive actions to pry bank lending windows wide open.Through executive order, he marshaled 10 federal agencies under a little-known task force to enforce new ""flexible"" mortgage underwriting guidelines to boost low-income and minority homeownership.For the first time, banks were ordered to qualify low-income borrowers with spotty credit. The 1994 policy planted the seeds of the mortgage crisis, as lenders eventually abandoned prudent underwriting altogether.The next year, Clinton set quotas for lending in high-risk neighborhoods under an overhauled Community Reinvestment Act, while adding several hundred bank examiners to enforce the tougher CRA rules. Banks that came up short had expansion plans put on hold — a slow death sentence in an era of bank mergers and acquisitions.For the first time, CRA ratings were made public, egging on ACORN and other radical inner-city groups, which used the reports to extort banks for $6 trillion in subprime loan set-asides by 2008.When bankers resisted being saddled with so many risky loans, Clinton tapped Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to take them off their books, while freeing bankers to originate more of the political loans. He had the Department of Housing and Urban Development nearly double Fannie's and Freddie's quotas for underwriting ""affordable"" loans, which remained in force throughout the 2000s.When the mortgage giants pushed back, complaining that it would be hard to meet the higher targets, Clinton pushed them to load up on subprime loans, while authorizing Fannie and Freddie for the first time to buy subprime securities to earn credits toward the HUD goals. The mortgage giants complied to their great detriment.So Clinton was also responsible for securitizing these loans which combined bad loans with good loans in packages that were sold to Wall Street institutions, including insurance companies. The mix of these junk loans made it impossible for investors to tell good ones from bad, and the markets eventually seized up and crashed.Through all this social engineering, Hillary was no innocent bystander.The Washington Examiner reports that a forthcoming documentary film — ""Subprime 2.0: Doubling Down On Disaster,"" which currently is crowdfunding on IndieGoGo.com — promises to expose the Clintons' role in the crisis and their cozy ties to ACORN. It will present new evidence showing White House aides close to Hillary even met with ACORN lobbyists to draft the bad housing regulations and policies.Few Americans know that the Clintons and ACORN go way back — ACORN actually started in Little Rock, Ark., and the Clintons were in bed with these radical activists from Day One. Hillary gave several ACORN speeches in which she hailed their ""movement.""Rest assured, their mortgage-busting lovefest will blossom anew in a Hillary White House.

About one-third bought the stainless-steel Apple Watch starting at $549.Most buyers (71%), choose the larger 42 millimeter case vs. the cheaper 38 mm version.So the average Sports watch buyer ended up spending $382.83 while the steel model cost an average of $707.04.The very expensive Gold model apparently didn't have enough U.S. pre-orders to register with Slice data.The Black Sport Band was the most popular, accounting for 49%. 16% chose a White Sport Band with about 10% favoring the more-expensive Milanese loop.72% of Apple Watch buyers bought an Apple product such as an iPhone, Mac or iPad in the last two years.Friday also was the first day that the the new super-slim Macbook was available, with some 48,000 sold, Slice estimated.

980,MAC,"Video game retailer GameStop (GME) hit the reset button late Thursday, delivering lower-than-expected fiscal Q4 sales and earnings and offering disappointing 2015 guidance.GameStop plans to reduce its video-game-store count and increase the number of its stores that sell mobile devices and wireless plans.GameStop stock was down nearly 1% in morning trading on the stock market today, near 38.50.The Grapevine, Texas-based company earned $2.15 a share for the quarter ended Jan. 31, up 13% from the year-earlier quarter. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters were expecting EPS of $2.17.Sales fell 5.6% to $3.48 billion. Wall Street was forecasting $3.6 billion. Growth in new game software and mobile and consumer electronics was offset by a decrease in game hardware sales, the company said.For the current quarter, GameStop expects comparable store sales to rise 2.5% to 5.5%. It sees total revenue slipping 0.5%, based on the midpoint of its guidance. It expects earnings per share of 53-60 cents, or 57 cents at the midpoint.For the year, GameStop is targeting same store sales to rise 1% to 6%. It sees total revenue rising 1.5% based on the midpoint of its guidance. It predicts EPS of $3.70 at the midpoint.Wall Street was modeling for EPS of $4.05 and same store sales growth of 4.1%.Still Rated OutperformGameStop has set the bar low enough to clear in 2015, Pacific Crest Securities Evan Wilson said in a research note late Thursday. But GameStop doesn't have a great track record for forecasts. Going into 2014, it expected same-store sales growth of 6% to 12% but ended the year with 3.4% growth, Wilson said. He rates GameStop stock outperform, with a price target of 48.Piper Jaffray analyst Michael Olson says GameStop is ""seeing the beginnings of renewed, sustainable multiyear growth in software sales, driven by the growing next-gen console installed base and new titles.""Last year, GameStop experienced an ""air pocket,"" as sales of the latest consoles from Microsoft (MSFT) and Sony (SNE) drew sales away from the prior generation consoles, Olson said in a note Friday. Microsoft's Xbox One and Sony's PlayStation 4 debuted in November 2013. Olson rates GameStop stock overweight, with a price target of 47.GameStop shares likely will continue to be under pressure from concerns about the shift of game software sales from retail transactions to digital downloads, Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter said in a note Thursday.""The negative headline risk from full game downloads (FGD) should persist for the foreseeable future,"" Pachter said. ""We remain confident that GameStop can overcome the drag on revenues and profits from the migration to FGD over the next several years through its ancillary businesses. However, certain skeptical investors likely will not share our conviction, putting GameStop shares under pressure.""In 2015, GameStop expects to increase the store count of its technology-brands segment by about 350 to 550 stores, while reducing its video game store count by about 3%. GameStop operates more than 6,600 stores across 14 countries.Its technology-brands segment includes 60 Simply Mac stores, which sell Apple (AAPL) products; 361 Spring Mobile stores, which sell AT&T (T) wireless products and services; and 63 Cricket Wireless stores, which sells prepaid wireless services and devices.Video game products and services accounted for about 91% of GameStop's sales in the fourth quarter.RELATED:Most video game players still want physical discs.

983,MAC,"One of the most peculiar things about Washington is there's no learning curve. Mistakes are repeated with no recognition that we've tried this before and it didn't turn out so well. Congress is like Bill Murray in ""Groundhog Day,"" replaying the same boneheaded decisions day after day.And so it goes with one of the hottest ""new"" ideas in Washington built into the Democratic budget plan: an infrastructure bank to fund road, transit, green energy and other brick-and-mortar ""shovel-ready projects.""Because budgets are tight and we already have a half-trillion-dollar deficit, road builders and unions and left-wing think tanks want to create a government-sponsored enterprise fund to borrow money and fund up to $150 billion of infrastructure projects.One plan, sponsored by Rep. John Delaney of Maryland, would create an infrastructure bank funded with $50 billion, leveraged to backstop 50-year bonds that would finance billions in new transportation projects.The second-term Democrat calls it Infrastructure 2.0. The Washington Post glowingly calls it ""innovative.""The Obama administration has a similar plan to create a bank funded by a $50 billion tax hike on overseas profits of U.S. multinationals. The $50 billion would collateralize tens of billions of dollars of long-term loans from private investors that would fund up to $100 billion of new projects each year.Magical MoneyThe White House says that this plan could nearly double funding for highway and transit projects with this magical stash of funds. The supposed selling point: After the initial funding, taxpayers wouldn't have to put up a dime; it would all be paid for with private dollars collected. What a deal!Except for the fine print. The full faith and credit of the U.S. government would back these loans. If the bank experiences financial stress, the government would be on the hook to repay the loans. As Ronald Reagan would say: Well, there they go again.This was exactly the financing mechanism that propped up Fannie Mae with its scam arrangement of 100% taxpayer guarantees on subprime mortgages. Obama's budget chief once wrote that the chances of a Fannie Mae default were close to one in a million. It was supposed to be free money for housing — until it wasn't.Now, $150 billion in losses later, we know that Fannie and its sister organization Freddie Mac required one of the most expensive taxpayer bailouts in American history. A lot of people got rich off of cheap Fannie and Freddie credit, and taxpayers were taken to the cleaners. This is anything but a model worth imitating.Think of it this way: Do taxpayers want guarantee loans for the $70 billion high-speed rail project in California that may be the most absurd white elephant project in American history? How about underwriting the Bridge to Nowhere in Alaska? They sound like sound investments.A close inspection of many of these infrastructure bank proposals indicates that rather than investments being based on sound financial justifications, politics will play a major role.Welfare ProgramsThe infrastructure bank is to take into account factors including reduction in carbon emissions and income inequality, job training for low-income workers, energy efficiency, expanded renewable energy and requirements that iron, steel and other inputs be produced in the U.S.These sound like social welfare projects, not infrastructure. Worst of all, any project that the bank funds must meet Davis-Bacon Act requirements, which effectively mean union wages and union crews. They inflate project costs by 10% to 20%. So much for getting bang for the buck.By the way, the feds already provide a giant subsidy for local infrastructure projects via the tax exemption on municipal bonds. It lowers the interest rates that cities and states must pay on their infrastructure bonds. Rates in the muni market have fallen sharply, from 5.41% in 2011 to 3.6% last month — the lowest borrowing costs in nearly half a century.A much smarter approach to a federally subsidized infrastructure bank is to get the federal government and Congress out of the business of funding infrastructure projects. Local roads, bridges and transit projects should be paid for by state and local governments and their taxpayers — so the users pay for them.California would never go ahead with its high-speed rail project if national taxpayers weren't helping underwrite it. Cut the federal gas tax and allow states to raise theirs to pay for necessary projects.If we've learned anything from the housing meltdown in 2007-09, it's that if a Washington deal sounds too good to be true, it is. A Fannie Mae for roads and bridges and Solyndras is a bank that should never open. Moore is an economist at the Heritage Foundation.

986,MAC,"Extortion: After 16 banks caved in to White House demands to refund billions in losses to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, one outlier remains unrepentant. Nomura Holdings refuses to succumb to the political shakedown.The Japanese bank's U.S. unit won't give in to the extortionist regulators protecting Fannie and Freddie who claim it hoodwinked the toxic twins into buying pools of subprime mortgages, like it claimed Bank of America, JPMorgan and other U.S. banks did in the run-up to the mortgage crisis.The government demands $1 billion in damages. Nomura says it won't give a dime toward the $18 billion ransom the feds already have shaken out of other banks who settled with the Federal Housing Finance Agency. Instead, it will make government prove it in court.In opening arguments this week, the defendants argued Fannie and Freddie bought the mortgages knowing they were subprime and did so to meet ""affordable housing"" quotas of their political masters at HUD.Unfortunately for Nomura, the game is rigged. The federal judge hearing the case — Clinton appointee Denise Cote — is a ringer for the administration.In recent filings, Cote has shown extreme prejudice in her decisions — virtually all rendered against Nomura.Even though she concedes that, in buying subprime securities from Nomura, ""Freddie Mac considered the extent to which the underlying mortgage loans satisfied these housing goals,"" Cote claims such evidence is ""immaterial"" to the case. She argues the regulatory mandates, purchasing quotas and other political pressures heaped on Fannie and Freddie were merely ""idiosyncratic"" and therefore irrelevant.Please. The HUD goals are highly relevant to this case. Internal documents from both HUD and Fannie and Freddie show the goals were driving them deeper into the subprime securities market and both complained about a growing risk of losses. So clearly, they understood the risks. There was no ""misrepresentation.""And if they failed to perform the proper due diligence, it's because it wouldn't have mattered — they had to buy risky subprime securities to meet HUD quotas for loans to low-income borrowers with bad credit. They were culpable in the recklessness, and therefore culpable in the losses they suffered when those loans defaulted. Nomura shouldn't be on the hook for those losses.In its defense, Nomura plans to call former Fannie and Freddie officials, including former Fannie CEO Daniel Mudd, to testify about how it was Fannie and Freddie who on orders from HUD lowered underwriting standards, not Nomura.According to former Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission member Peter Wallison's ""Hidden in Plain Sight,"" Mudd wrote to a top HUD official in 2007: ""In 2006 Fannie Mae relaxed certain underwriting standards and purchased some higher risk mortgage loan products in an effort to meet the housing goals. The company continued to purchase higher risk loans into 2007, and believes these efforts to acquire goals-rich loans are partially responsible for increasing credit losses.""So Nomura didn't sell them fraudulently sub-standard loans from 2005 to 2007; Fannie and Freddie had already lowered standards to find more goals-qualifying loans in that riskier market.Portraying the largest, most sophisticated players in the mortgage market as rubes or victims is laughable. Fannie and Freddie knew what they were buying. They have only themselves — and their regulators — to blame.Even now, Fannie warns investors of the ""risk factors"" associated with its housing goals, which are now enforced by FHFA.""The potential penalties for failure to comply with housing plan requirements include a cease-and-desist order and civil money penalties,"" it reported in its Dec. 31 10-K filing. ""As described in 'Risk Factors,' actions we may take to meet our housing goals may increase our credit losses and credit-related expense.""Cote is expected to rule against Nomura sometime next month. When she does, the administration no doubt will trumpet it as proof Fannie and Freddie were steered into subprime waters by greedy Wall Street bankers and not their politically driven regulators.Don't buy it. It's part of the ongoing cover-up of government's role in the financial crisis.

987,MAC,"Ray Kroc steered McDonald's to the top of fast food. His winning recipe? He was flexible, nurtured franchisee relationships and reacted to business challenges with an open mind.""Just as Henry Ford's idea was brought to reality through hard work, perseverance, just plain doggedness and above all faith, so McDonald's astounding success was achieved through those same qualities,"" Kroc wrote in a 1969 company newsletter. ""We can never rest on our laurels. We must always keep our ideal dream before us and work with faith so that we can accomplish ever more than we have.""Despite initial low profit, Kroc (1902-84) used an entrepreneurial spirit to grow McDonald's, revolutionizing the fast-food industry through a standardized approach to restaurant franchises and an openness to new ideas.Today, McDonald's (MCD) is still cooking. 2014 sales hit $27 billion, a 29% rise since 2006. Its stock has climbed 640% in the past 12 years.Kroc drove himself from the start. A high school dropout in Oak Park, Ill., he lied about his age in 1917 to sign up as an ambulance driver for the Red Cross as World War I raged in Europe.The war ended before his training did. So he steered to various jobs: piano player, paper cup salesman, milkshake machine salesman.Life Begins At 50Kroc was in his 50s during his milkshake mixer career, but he was just getting started.The big turn came in 1954, when a large order for Prince Castle Multimixers, which could mix five milkshakes at once, came from a San Bernardino, Calif., restaurant owned by brothers Dick and Mac McDonald.Kroc flew to California to meet the brothers and was amazed by their booming operation, which focused on a few key items — burgers, fries and drinks.The duo's emphasis on quality set them apart from competitors.Kroc was hooked. He shared with the brothers his vision of opening McDonald's restaurants all over the country. Then he cut a deal with the duo and started McDonald's Corp. in 1955.Now head of the operation, Kroc laid out the strategy: From its headquarters in Oak Brook, Ill., the company would sell franchises to individual restaurant owners for the low price of $950 and in exchange receive 1.4% of all sales. Also in the mix, the McDonald brothers would receive 0.5%.In 1961, Kroc purchased the exclusive rights to the McDonald's name and bought out the duo for $2.7 million.Now running the operation, he initiated an enterprise that grew from that one restaurant into more than 7,700 at his death in 1984.Today, McDonald's is the world's leading global food-service retailer, with over 36,000 locations in over 100 countries.Paul Facella, a longtime consultant at McDonald's and the author of ""Everything I Learned About Business I Learned At McDonald's,"" notes that Kroc had a slogan that epitomized his unique relationship with the franchisees: ""You make the first buck, I'll make the second buck.""When Kroc first opened for business in 1955, contenders in the fast-food arena were A&W, Dairy Queen, Tastee-Freez and Big Boy.""Kroc took great pains to differentiate McDonald's from these players. ... The crucial difference between Kroc and his rivals was one of world view. He saw franchises as business partners, not mere customers,"" wrote Daniel Gross in ""Forbes Greatest Business Stories of all Time."" ""In his travels selling the multimixer, he had observed the way franchisers milked franchisees for profits without concern for their long-term viability. Kroc vowed not to fall into that lucrative, but ultimately unproductive, trap,"" wrote Gross.Facella added: ""Kroc understood the franchises were a long-term relationship. He wanted to make sure the franchises were successful, because the success of the franchise would ultimately make the company successful. In the beginning years, if a franchise was struggling, if he had to help, he would work with it. He realized it was to the company's advantage as opposed to saying, 'Hey you missed your franchisee payment.' ""Ultimately, Kroc left his competition in the dust as he expanded his operation while focusing on quality every step of the way.Three Legs, Sturdy CompanyKroc promoted a philosophy of a three-legged stool in which one leg was McDonald's, the second the franchisees and the third McDonald's suppliers and vendors.""He understood the need for all three to be strong. That principle was a hallmark of Ray Kroc,"" Facella told IBD.Mike Bullington, corporate archivist at McDonald's, said that Kroc stressed that the firm ""would only be as successful as its franchisees.""Being flexible was crucial in propelling Kroc toward mammoth success. In the early years, even though the number of restaurants expanded fast, company earnings were minimal due to the original deal of low franchising fees.""Through 1960, when the chain's restaurants raked up $75 million in sales, McDonald's earnings were a mere $159,000,"" wrote Gross.Shifting gears, Kroc began to focus on real estate as a potential profit center, with the idea that McDonald's could make money by leasing or buying restaurant sites.From that concept came Franchise Realty Corp., which bought or leased properties that it would then sublease to franchises at a 20%, and later 40%, markup.""Franchisees would then pay McDonald's either a minimum rate or a percentage of sales, whichever was greater,"" wrote Gross. ""As sales and prices inevitably rose over the years, the company would collect more and more rent as its costs remained virtually constant.""Quality FirstMcDonald's progress came with Kroc's commitment to quality, no matter how large the operation became, said Usha Haley, a West Virginia University professor of management. ""He reduced making a good burger to a common denominator that could be replicated everywhere,"" Haley said. ""Everything was put into an equation, including how many ounces goes into a burger.""Kroc pointed to QSCV, which stood for quality, service, cleanliness, value. ""This was the basic DNA building block of McDonald's,"" said Haley. ""He tried to make the product of a burger into a production line, but still had quality, service and cleanliness.""Barb Schmidt, who observed that Kroc approach while she ran six McDonald's restaurants in Florida, before selling them in 1996, said: ""He was so passionate about serving the customers the highest quality food in a reasonable amount of time at an affordable price. He wanted every customer to have the same experience each and every time they came to McDonald's. He always took great pride in the service, cleanliness and friendliness of his company. I believe that is what led to the extraordinary success of McDonald's — his consistent attitude of greatness.""Kroc instituted strict quality control and guidelines for franchisees. He also gave the restaurants a certain amount of autonomy, with the idea of lifting their entrepreneurial spirit. ""He was open to listening to franchisees' ideas,"" said Haley.Some of those concepts involved new products. ""Franchises came up with Filet-O-Fish, the Big Mac and Egg McMuffin,"" said Haley.Kroc liked such results rather than being hung up on resumes.""Ray never graduated from high school,"" said Facella. ""McDonald's was about meritocracy. It didn't matter if you went to college; it was about if you could make things happen. If you were very good at what you do, you could move up.""On top of all that was Kroc's humanity, said Schmidt: ""What I remember most about this amazing man was his ability to give you his full attention when he spoke with you. I felt like I was the only person in the room.""When Facella was a midlevel manager in New York City during his 34-year career at McDonald's, he met Kroc for the first time: ""He popped out of his limo and walks up to me: 'Hi Paul, how are you today?' I said, 'It is nice to meet you, Mr. Kroc,' and he looked at me and said, 'I'm Ray. Don't call me Mr. Kroc.'""From there, the two got into an old-style limousine with a flip seat. ""Naturally, I sat in the flip seat,"" recalled Facella. ""But Ray said, 'Paul, you are my guest; you sit in the comfortable seat.' There was humility about the man. He just cared about treating people right and making them feel good, which is part of his legacy. He is someone who is truly in the top five people I will ever meet in my life.""

988,MAC,"More than a month before the Apple Watch goes on sale, debate about the prospects for Apple's (AAPL) first smartwatch shows no signs of abating.Apple fans say the wearable device will be another hit for the Cupertino, Calif.-based company. Skeptics say the first-generation Apple Watch is too expensive and doesn't do much beyond extending iPhone functionality to a small display on your wrist.Backers of the Apple Watch say it will show its worth once more third-party developers release innovative apps for the device. They say critics doubted the potential for the iPhone and iPad as well. They say people will crave the Apple Watch as a beautiful timepiece that also functions as a health and fitness tracker, a new communications tool, a mobile wallet and a way to provide unobtrusive notifications.Critics of the Apple Watch doubt that it will become a mainstream product based on its current pricing and the fact that it has to be paired with an iPhone 5 or 6 series handset to be fully functional. They also say the user interface is complicated and confusing and that the promised one-day battery life is insufficient. Some say a second-generation smartwatch with more health monitoring sensors and independent wireless functionality will be needed to drive mass market adoption.Apple will begin taking preorders for the Apple Watch on April 10 and begin selling the wearable device on April 24 in the U.S. and eight other countries. It initially will be sold only through Apple's online and retail stores, with the exception of select authorized resellers in China and Japan.It comes in three models (standard, sport and luxury) and two screen sizes (1.5 and 1.65 inches). The entry-level Sport model costs $349 and $399. The midrange standard model costs $549 to $1,099 and the gold luxury Edition model costs $10,000 to $17,000.Apple won't provide much data on Apple Watch sales in the near term because its results will be lumped into together with other devices like the iPod, Apple TV, Beats headphones and accessories. By contrast, Apple details unit and dollar sales for its three main products: iPhone, iPad and Mac.On Thursday, watchmaker Swatch unveiled a new lineup of Swatch Touch smartwatches with additional functions. Swatch Chief Executive Nick Hayek told a news conference that his company is not looking to produce a wearable mobile phone like Apple, Reuters reported. Instead, Swatch will add technologies to its watches such as activity tracking and near-field communications for contactless payments, the Wall Street Journal reported.Sonny Vu, founder of Misfit Wearables, a maker of activity, fitness and sleep monitors, told UBS Securities that fashion is as important as technology in the Apple Watch, considering the high price ranges. Apple Watch has an edge over smartwatch rivals, such as those using Google's (GOOGL) Android Wear operating system, in that its watches are so customizable with different case materials, bands and colors, Vu said.Misfit's Vu doubts Apple Watch will provide much competition for low-cost activity and fitness trackers.Meanwhile, Apple is preparing for the Apple Watch launch by removing competing fitness bands from its stores. Apple retail stores have stopped selling activity-tracking bands from Jawbone and Nike (NKE), according to Re/code. Last fall, Apple pulled Fitbit trackers from its stores. The Apple Watch provides basic fitness information such as tracking steps and calories burned and measuring heart rate during workouts.Apple stock rose 1.9% to 124.54 on the stock market today.RELATED:5 reasons why the Apple Watch will bomb.

It was a day in which Apple's online services suffered a major outage and early reviews of the Apple Watch raised possible concerns.Apple's iTunes and App Store were down for about 11 hours on Wednesday, from just before 5 a.m. ET to shortly after 4 p.m. Customers were unable to make purchases from those stores, as well as the iBooks Store and Mac App Store. The company blamed the outage on an internal technical error, Reuters said.Apple's system status page also reported a four-hour problem Wednesday with the company's iCloud backup service.Meanwhile, Apple's upcoming smartwatch was dinged by early reviews that called the device's user interface complicated and confusing. Others said the device could be annoying with its always-in-view alerts and tactile reminders. Those are in addition to tech reviewers who said the Apple Watch lacks a killer app and is too expensive.But many critics praised the device for its beautiful craftsmanship, premium materials and various fun apps for communications, health and fitness, and mobile payments, among others.In a report Tuesday, Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi said he was ""underwhelmed"" by the Apple Watch presentation the company held on Monday. He is cautious on initial sales relative to Wall Street's projections.Sacconaghi predicts Apple will sell 7.5 million units in fiscal 2015 and 20 million units in fiscal 2016. Apple's FY15 ends on Sept. 26.""We see 1-day battery life and lack of a wireless connection (which necessitates that an iPhone be nearby to ensure full functionality) as key gating factors to widespread adoption,"" Sacconaghi said. ""In short, we are not sure how compelling incremental use cases are for the Watch, especially since most functions/apps are likely to run just as well or better on an iPhone, which needs to be in close proximity to the Watch.""RELATED:5 reasons why the Apple Watch will bomb.

1032,MAC,"Microsoft wants consumers to ""love"" its Windows operating system, so it's making the next version free to users of the last two major releases. Windows 10 also will bring back popular PC features like the traditional desktop and Start Menu, plus add new experiences like the ability to view holograms with special glasses. 
"
1033,MAC,"Microsoft (MSFT) outlined its strategy for Windows 10 at a press event Wednesday at its Redmond, Wash., headquarters.
"
1034,MAC,"Shares fell 1% to 45.91 on the stock market today on news that Microsoft will give out its cash-cow personal computer operating system for free. The stock has retreated since the Nov. 14 peak at 50.05, the highest since March 2000.
"
1035,MAC,"Microsoft likely will take a short-term revenue hit from giving free upgrades to Windows 10, but will benefit long-term by getting more users on the latest release, FBR Capital Markets analyst Daniel Ives told IBD. Apple (AAPL) took a similar strategy by making its Mac OS X releases free to users starting with Mavericks in October 2013.
"
1036,MAC,"Free OS upgrades are like ""bread at the restaurant in terms of what they're giving up in revenue,"" Ives said. ""The big opportunity is getting enterprises and consumers to choose the new platform.""
"
1037,MAC,"Microsoft will still get license revenue from PC makers for each copy of Windows installed on new PCs, which is the biggest source of Windows sales, Gartner analyst Michael Silver told IBD.
"
1038,MAC,"""If you look at upgrade revenue, it's not inconsequential, but it's not a ton of money compared with everything else and it pales next to the benefits they'll get by having everyone maintain a certain level of the experience,"" Silver said.
"
1039,MAC,"Microsoft has had trouble upgrading users from older operating systems. About 20% of PC users still have Windows XP, which was released over 13 years ago.
"
1040,MAC,"Windows 10 will be available later this year (no specific date given) and will be a free upgrade for a year to users of Windows 7 and Windows 8. Microsoft skipped over Windows 9 in its naming scheme to distance the new OS from Windows 8. Buyers rejected the Win 8 user interface which was designed for touchscreens even through few PCs have them.
"
1041,MAC,"Making Windows updates free is part of a shift to ""Windows as a service,"" said Terry Myerson, executive vice president of the Operating Systems group at Microsoft.
"
1042,MAC,"""With Windows 10, we think of Windows as a service,"" he said. ""In the next couple of years, one could reasonably think of Windows as one of the largest Internet services on the planet. And just like other Internet services, the question, 'What version are you running?' will cease to make sense.""
"
1043,MAC,"But unlike software-as-a-service from other companies, Microsoft isn't likely to charge a subscription fee for keeping Windows up to date, Silver said.
"
1044,MAC,"""Either you're going to charge a fee or you're going to get everyone to be on the same version and maintain consistency,"" Silver said. ""You can't do both, because not everyone is going to pay that fee.""

"
1048,MAC,"Microsoft also introduced a holographic computing experience with its HoloLens glasses.
"
1049,MAC,"The special glasses have see-through holographic high-definition lenses and spatial sound so you can view and hear holograms in the world around you. It can place three-dimensional holograms in your field of vision that you can manipulate and view from all sides like you're Tony Stark in the ""Iron Man"" movies.
"
1050,MAC,"The glasses have advanced sensors, a next-generation system on a chip and the addition of a completely new Holographic Processing Unit that understands what you are doing and the world around you. It can process terabytes of data from the sensors in real time.

"
1052,MAC,"HoloLens is ""a pretty bold move,"" trying to move augmented reality into the consumer market, Silver said. ""It's not something that's going to explode right away, but it's a way for Microsoft to surprise people.""
"
1053,MAC,"The HoloLens glasses will be pricey at first because they have the intelligence of a Windows PC, Silver said. Over the next few years, the price should come down to a level that's more affordable. ""At some point, it's going to need to be below $500, but it probably won't be there at the start,"" he said.
"
1054,MAC,"""As this technology improves there really are a lot of ramifications,"" Silver said.

1055,MAC,"The HoloLens glasses also demonstrate that Microsoft is interested in moving to new platforms like the Internet cloud and augmented reality, Ives said.

Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) shipped 15.88 million PCs worldwide in Q4, giving it 19.7% market share, IDC said.Lenovo increased its PC unit shipments by 4.9% year over year, but HP grew its unit shipments by 15.1%, IDC said.Lenovo surpassed HP to become the No. 1 PC seller in world in Q2 2013. HP had been the top dog since late 2006, when it took the crown from Dell.Overall PC shipments fell 2.4% in the fourth quarter, IDC said. Rival research firm Gartner, which measures the market differently, said PC shipments rose 1% last quarter.IDC said the top five vendors each increased their unit shipments year over year, while all other vendors saw PC shipments decline 20.7%.Apple (AAPL) posted the fastest growth among the top five, IDC said. Apple increased its Mac computer shipments by 18.9% to 5.75 million units in Q4. It maintained its No. 5 ranking with 7.1% market share, IDC said.Rounding out the top five were Dell (13.5% market share) in third place and Acer (7.7%) in fourth, IDC reported.For the year, PC shipments fell 2.1% to 308.6 million units, IDC said. Gartner put the decline at 0.2%. It was the third straight year of declining PC volumes, IDC said.""The strength from market leaders, as well as improvement in Asia-Pacific and the consumer market more generally, are positive signs for the PC market,"" IDC analyst Loren Loverde said in a statement.Gartner analyst Mikako Kitagawa said Q4 sales were boosted by improved consumer PC business and lower-priced notebooks.""The fourth quarter of 2014 was the best holiday for PC sales in recent history,"" Kitagawa said in a statement. ""The primary driver was mobile PCs including regular notebooks, thin and light notebooks and two-in-ones. Low priced notebooks with about a $200-$300 price point boosted shipments, while thin/light notebooks and two-in-ones (laptops with a detachable or bendable screen) showed strong growth. These results supports our assumption that consumer spending is returning to the PC as tablet penetration has reached the majority of the market.""In the U.S. market, HP was the top PC vendor in Q4 with 30.1% market share. Dell was second with 23.8%, followed by Apple (12.7%), Lenovo (10.2%) and Toshiba (6.5%), IDC said.Later this year, HP plans to split into two publicly traded companies: Hewlett-Packard Enterprise will focus on servers, storage, networking, services and software; and HP Inc. will sell personal computers and printers.

1092,MAC,"Apple (AAPL) stock climbed to its third all-time high in as many days Thursday, soaring on bullish comments from activist investor Carl Icahn and optimism about sales of current and upcoming products. One fresh rumor has Apple developing a car.Apple CEO Tim Cook on Tuesday drummed up interest in the company's Apple Watch, due for release in April, while speaking at a Goldman Sachs conference in San Francisco. He also said sales of iPhone 6 handsets and Mac computers remain strong, while iPad sales could get a boost later this year from Apple's enterprise partnership with IBM (IBM).Apple shares peaked at 127.48 on Thursday, but ended the day up 1.2% to 126.43.On Wednesday, Icahn posted a public letter online repeating his plea for Apple to be more aggressive with its stock buyback plan. He also raised his price target for Apple stock to 216 from 203.Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster on Thursday reiterated his overweight rating on Apple stock with a price target of 135.Now that the Apple Watch has been announced, Apple likely is turning its focus to television, Munster said in a research note. He doesn't expect an Apple television set soon, but says the company is working on an update to its Apple TV set-top box and software.""We believe the most likely path to a TV would be an update to the Apple TV hardware and software that potentially integrates content, gaming, and HomeKit in the fall of 2015, and a television at least a year later,"" Munster said.Apple might be able to put together an Internet television service, now that Dish Network (DISH) has blazed a trail with its Sling TV service, he said.""The concept of content providers being willing to participate in the paid Internet streaming model is a positive sign that Apple could develop a content service,"" Munster said.Meanwhile, rumors are swirling that Apple might be contemplating entering the car business, competing with luxury electric car maker Tesla Motors (TSLA).This week, Business Insider quoted an Apple employee who said ""vehicle development"" at the company ""will change the landscape and give Tesla a run for its money."" The source said many Tesla employees were ""jumping ship"" to work at Apple.On Tuesday, Bryan Chaffin, co-founder of The Mac Observer , wrote that his sources confirmed that Apple is indeed working on a car.""Apple has been looking for — and acquiring — the kind of people from Tesla with expertise that is most suited to cars,"" Chaffin said. ""So much so that I went from being a doubter to a believer almost instantly.""To those who dismiss the idea by saying Apple doesn't know anything about cars, Chaffin responds that Apple didn't know anything about cellphones before it started developing the iPhone. He also points out that electric cars have a big software component, which is in Apple's wheelhouse.RELATED:Apple Investors Watching For Next Big Thing.

1093,MAC,"Apple (AAPL) stock spiked to a record high for the second straight day after CEO Tim Cook outlined the company's prospects on Tuesday at the Goldman Sachs Technology and Internet Conference in San Francisco.Apple stock was up more than 2% in late-afternoon trading on the stock market today, pennies off its all-time split-adjusted high of 124.92, reached earlier in the session. The Cupertino, Calif.-based company now has a market capitalization of $725 billion.Cook praised the upcoming Apple Watch smartwatch, said the rollout of Apple Pay is going faster than expected, and noted that the outlook is robust for iPhone, iPad and Mac computers.On Wednesday, activist investor Carl Icahn raised his price target for Apple stock to 216 from 203. In an open letter, he reiterated his call for Apple management to implement more aggressive stock buybacks. Cook said Tuesday that Apple will address its corporate cash allocation plan in April.""It is now plainly obvious to us that there will be no stopping Apple's peerless innovation track record and best-in-class ecosystem of services, software and hardware,"" Icahn wrote. He said Apple will continue to dominate the premium smartphone market and take market share from Google (GOOGL) Android devices, while growing average selling prices and gross profit margins. ""We look forward to the introduction of the Apple Watch in April, as well as the launch of other new products in new categories,"" he said.UBS analyst Steven Milunovich gave Cook high marks for his presentation on Tuesday. He maintained his buy rating on Apple stock with a price target of 130.He appreciated that Cook dismissed talk of Apple's growth slowing down because of ""the law of large numbers.""""Cook said (1) Apple doesn't believe in the law as (co-founder Steve) Jobs taught not to put limits on thinking (our sense is he thinks the smartphone market is not saturated), and (2) Apple focuses on the things that produce the numbers, most important making great products,"" Milunovich said in a note Wednesday.RELATED:Apple partners with First Solar on massive energy plantQ4 no fluke: Apple iPhone 6 sales strength to continueApple in talks with TV programmers for Internet service.

1094,MAC,"Apple investors looking for the next big catalyst for the consumer electronics company have turned their attention to the upcoming Apple Watch launch in April.
"
1095,MAC,"Apple (AAPL) introduced the smartwatch at a media event on Sept. 9. The wrist-worn device will come in standard, sport and luxury styles and will offer 1.5- and 1.65-inch screens, plus a variety of wristbands. Prices will start at $349.Many details have yet to be disclosed about the Apple Watch, including prices for the entire lineup of devices and accessories. Battery life for the watch is an issue as well.Consumer demand for the new smartwatch is also a big question mark. Surveys to date have shown only modest interest in the Apple Watch among smartphone owners.Apple CEO Tim Cook wore an Apple Watch to the Goldman Sachs Technology and Internet Conference in San Francisco on Tuesday. He sang its praises when asked about it in an on-stage interview.Other companies have come out with smartwatches, but Apple will be the one that gets it right, just as it did with the iPod for MP3 players and iPad for the tablets, Cook says.What's On 'Apple Watch' List?Apple hopes that the Apple Watch will change people's lives for the better, whether by encouraging them to be more physically active or by discouraging them from checking their smartphones for information all the time.""People will be surprised by the breadth of what it will do,"" Cook said. ""Everyone is going to have their favorite thing, just like when the App Store came out. You remember the tagline 'There's an app for that' and the way you felt about your favorite app. You're going to have a feeling like that.""The Apple Watch looks ""fantastic"" and is more than a timepiece, he said. It can provide subtle notifications to your wrist, such as updating you on sports scores and financial markets, and it can track your health and fitness data.Cook says that he uses the Apple Watch in the gym to track his activity level and exercise data. In the office, it taps his wrist if he is sitting too long, to remind him to get up and move. ""A lot of doctors believe that sitting is the new cancer,"" he said. ""Activity is good for all of us.""He also uses the Siri voice-response personal assistant app, built into the Apple Watch. ""I constantly use Siri with my watch and ask different things,"" he said.""There's an enormous number of things that it can do,"" Cook said. ""You're going to think, 'Wow, I can't live without this.'""He added that he's ""super excited"" about the third-party apps in development for the Apple Watch.Consumer polls measuring purchase intent for the Apple Watch are pretty much meaningless at this point, Hudson Square Research analyst Daniel Ernst tells IBD. As Apple co-founder Steve Jobs used to say, people don't know what they want until you show it to them, Ernst says.Among 500 million-plus Apple users, ""there's going to be enough willing to give it a whirl without it even becoming a mainstream product,"" he said. ""It will do well.""Production is apt to be limited at first as Apple gauges demand and ramps up production, he says.Morningstar analyst Brian Colello says that the monster success of the new iPhone 6 series phones, which debuted last September, demonstrates that Apple's brand is very strong. That strength should help the Apple Watch, he says.""It bodes well for the possibility that customers will buy the next Apple gadget, perhaps independent of price and features,"" Colello said. The Apple Watch could ""ride the coattails"" of the iPhone, he said.Macs, iPhones, iPads Sell WellWhile the Apple Watch is the company's next big thing, the outlook for its current product categories is upbeat, Cook says.Mac computer sales are up, while the rest of the PC industry is in decline. The iPhone 6 upgrade cycle is poised to continue this year after a record December quarter. The company's partnership with IBM (IBM) is aimed at increasing iPad usage in corporations and other large enterprises. And the Apple Pay contactless payment service is seeing faster-than-expected adoption, Cook says.Plus, Apple is setting the stage for future growth with software innovations rolled out last year, Cook says. They include its Swift programming language, HealthKit for correlating and sharing health and fitness information, HomeKit for controlling your home with Siri, and CarPlay to extend iOS into your car. ""That is huge for our future. It's not every day you can plant that many foundational technologies,"" he said.But the iPhone is the product currently driving Apple's business.In the December quarter, Apple's Q1, the iPhone accounted for 69% of total sales. Huge demand for the bigger-screen iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus fueled a surge in sales. Apple sold 74.5 million iPhones in fiscal Q1, up 46% vs. a year earlier.Apple's total sales rose 30% year over year to $74.6 billion. It was the third straight quarter of accelerating revenue growth.Earnings per share at Apple have grown even faster than sales, thanks to aggressive share buybacks and sales of higher-margin iPhone 6 series phones. EPS grew 48% year over year in fiscal Q1, marking the fifth straight quarter of growth that was equal to or higher than the quarter before.Apple investors have applauded the company's recent performance, driving the stock price to all-time highs this week.""Tech stocks are ultimately about growth,"" analyst Ernst said. ""In 2013 their earnings declined 10%, but in the year before that they rose 60%. There was a lot of prognostication during that time and a lot of theories and big-picture thinking about (Apple's future). But at the end of the day, the one reason why Apple stock fell (in 2013) was because earnings declined.""In fiscal 2014, ended in September, Apple's earnings rose 14%. In Q1 fiscal 2015, earnings skyrocketed. So it's no surprise that Apple's stock price is up as well, he says.A rising Apple has floated the boats of many of its component suppliers. Chip firms boosted lately due to Apple ties include Avago Technologies (AVGO), NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM).

Rates nationwide averaged 3.87% this week, according to mortgage firm Freddie Mac (FMCC).The number of Americans signing contracts to buy homes rose modestly in November as a strengthening economy helped nudge some would-be homebuyers.The National Association of Realtors said Wednesday that its seasonally adjusted pending home sales index climbed 0.8% the past month to 104.8 from a revised 104 in October. The index remains slightly below its 2013 average but is 4.1% higher than last November.Pending sales are a barometer of future purchases. A one- to two-month lag usually exists between a contract and a completed sale. The number of contract signings rose in the Northeast, South and West last month, and fell in the Midwest.""Home sales activity will likely continue to be uninspiring in the months ahead,"" Laura Rosner, an economist at BNP Paribas, said in a research note to clients.Housing has struggled to rebound fully since the recession ended more than five years ago. Many potential buyers lack the savings and strong credit history needed to afford a home, causing them to rent or remain in their existing houses instead of upgrading. Higher home prices and relatively stagnant incomes also have curtailed buying.Separate NAR data last week showed that sales of existing homes fell 6.1% in November to the slowest pace in six months, The Commerce Department said last week that new home sales slid 1.6% in November to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 438,000.

1139,MAC,"Powered by robust demand and lean supply, high-end mall owners and quality shopping center operators are primed to perform in 2015.They are riding the crest of a stronger economy and healthy consumer spending climate, and are now luring shoppers with enhanced services and experiences.The bright prospects come at a time when the stars are also aligned for the retail industry.""Retailers are heading into 2015 with the most momentum they've had since the Great Recession,"" Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics, told IBD.A healthy consumer spending climate at retail would bode well for big mall owners such as Simon Property Group (SPG), Macerich (MAC), General Growth Properties (GGP), and Taubman Centers (TCO) as well as community and neighborhood shopping center operator and owner Kimco Realty (KIM), all of which benefit when their tenants get more financially fit.Malls And The MarketRetail mall real estate investment trusts are part of IBD's Finance-Property REIT industry group, and several get high Composite Ratings. Out of a possible 99, Kimco Realty has a 98, Simon Property Group a 91 and General Growth Properties an 87, factoring in metrics such as earnings growth and stock-price gains.All three have run up in the stock market. Kimco Realty shares rose 27% in 2014 and are up 11% this year. General Growth Properties jumped 40% in 2014 and is up 9% in 2015. Simon Property Group lifted 27% in 2014 and is up 11% this year.Macro tailwinds should help malls this year.""There should be a lot of momentum with the (stronger) economy and (lower) energy prices,"" Ryan Severino, senior economist for commercial real estate tracker Reis (REIS), told IBD via email. ""The decline in energy should add billions in spending. Some of that will accrue to malls. The real question is how much and will that be enough to offset the impact of store closings?""The top firms should still be regional mall REITs that focus on ""A"" malls — those that sell the most per square foot and tend toward more upscale retailers and trade areas — real estate experts say.""Class A malls should continue to have low vacancy and strong rent growth (in 2015),"" said Severino. ""But for the remainder of the subsector, vacancy could actually rise, and rent growth will probably accelerate only slightly.""At year end, the national mall vacancy rate was 8%, up 10 basis points for in 2014. Rents grew by 1.8% during that year, says Severino. He forecasts that in 2015, rents should grow by roughly 2% to 2.5%.But the national vacancy rate is not likely to change much in 2015 as store closures will offset rising demand and the outlook for lower-caliber malls ""is murkier,"" he said. ""Although a strengthening recovery in the economy and labor market, coupled with a decline in energy prices, should bolster the subsector, this will compete against the store closings (in lower-caliber malls) of some important retailers such asJ.C. Penney (JCP) and Sears (SHLD).""Class A OverachieversStifel Nicolaus analyst Nathan Isbee is also upbeat about prospects for ""A"" malls. ""Retailer demand for high-quality mall space will remain robust in 2015 from international and domestic retailers,"" he wrote in a report, calling high-quality mall space is ""extremely limited.""General Growth Properties is his top regional mall pick for 2015. The REIT focuses exclusively on owning, managing, leasing and redeveloping Class A regional malls and urban flagship locations in the U.S., spokesman Kevin Berry told IBD.He says the firm believes that owning these retail properties positions it well for the long term.Generally, he adds, the properties' leases have ten-year terms with annual contractual increases in rent. ""On average, 10% of the leases expire,"" he said. ""The majority of the annual revenue (is) in place when the year begins.""General Growth Properties' strategy since Sandeep Mathrani became CEO in 2011 has been the creation of a redevelopment/expansion pipeline of projects, Berry says. As of Dec. 31, the firm had development and redevelopment activities totaling about $2.4 billion ""at share,"" of which projects totaling about $418 million have opened, $1.2 billion are under construction and $825 million are in the pipeline.Redevelopment is all tenant driven, says Berry. General's largest redevelopment project is at Ala Moana Center in Honolulu, which it is expanding with a new luxury wing anchored by Bloomingdale's and Nordstrom (JWN). General also focuses on improving the shopping experience by adding options such as movie theaters and restaurants, which give shoppers more reasons to come to the malls and spend time.""Mall vacancies in the U.S. are currently at a five-year low of 5.7% and at 5.5% for just the major markets,"" said Greg Maloney, CEO of the Americas Retail Group at commercial real estate firm Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL), citing real estate data company CoStar as the source.He says that malls are going into 2015 with probably the best fundamentals seen in the past five years.""Liquidity and appetite for product has been here for a few years, but now consumers are feeling much better about the economy, and that is the driving force,"" he adds. ""We now have positive momentum. Retailers are looking to expand with new stores, and there's a renewed interest in terms of retailers looking for new space.""He says that there's some new mall development for the first time in a long time, including three or four projects that JLL is doing.Isbee notes that shopping center REIT fundamentals are ""healthy as occupancies are approaching or exceeding pre-recession levels.""Kimco Realty is among REITs he rates a buy. It operates North America's largest publicly traded portfolio of neighborhood and community shopping centers. CEO David Henry calls fundamentals for such shopping centers strong. ""We've been very fortunate that there's been no new building of shopping centers for six years,"" he told IBD.While the supply of centers hasn't grown, the U.S. population has grown at between 2.5 million and 3 million people a year. And the need for restaurants, grocers, dry cleaners and other businesses has grown with the population.""That's why occupancies are moving up and all the vital signs are looking good for shopping centers,"" he said, adding that shopping centers are still in ""recovery mode"" and rents not back to all-time highs. But he says Kimco is benefiting from more demand and limited supply.Henry says that occupancy at ""quality"" centers is at 95%, close to Kimco's all-time high of 96% before the recession.Redevelopment Vs. New MallsKimco has been doing a lot of redevelopment, he says, and the best place to invest capital is in its own properties — the value of projects in the pipeline is nearing $1 billion.Most of the new development among the mall REITs has been concentrated on outlet centers, with six opened in 2014, says Isbee.David Ober, president of Global Outlet Management, says that among the reasons behind building more outlet centers is retailers' desire to include outlet stores as a part of their ""omnichannel"" distribution mix along with full-price stores.Still, Garrick Brown, vice president of research at property services firm DTZ, says, ""We are nearing a saturation point"" in outlet center building and adds that there's room for only ""a little more product.""""Everyone wants to jump on this bandwagon to build these because they have performed so well in recent years,"" he said by email. ""But they will probably build too many.""

1149,MAC,"Ninety percent of startups fail within 10 years. So writes MJ Gottlieb in ""How to Ruin a Business Without Really Trying.""""Everyone seems to be putting the spotlight on the small percentage who get it right,"" he told IBD. ""What we should be spending our time on is studying and researching the 90% to see what the overwhelming majority are doing wrong in order to start swinging the odds back in our favor.""Tips on doing it: Analyze setbacks. Like a coach scrutinizing game film, executives should learn from mistakes, embracing them as opportunities.Gottlieb sees two angles:People choose to ignore errors, leading to inevitable failure.Then there are those who embrace learning from them, as ""they will become the stepping stones to your success."" Ask for help. ""The entrepreneur's ego often doesn't allow that to happen, and they pay the price in the long run,"" Gottlieb has found. ""Study your market, do your due diligence, but never be afraid to look for senior guidance.""To find mentors, network and join applicable associations. Stay even-keel. ""An entrepreneur always needs to put their intelligence in front of their emotions,"" Gottlieb said. That helps people act the most sensibly. Learn what customers want. ""Too many entrepreneurs create a product or service before checking its viability in the market first,"" said Gottlieb. ""Entrepreneurs must research the market and work backward."" Failing to do so can exhaust your startup capital. Know your expertise.  ""As they say, the jack of all trades is the master of none,"" Gottlieb said. Understand your strengths and find people who are strong in areas where you aren't. ""Plugging your weaknesses will not only make your company strong as a whole, but it will also allow you to keep getting better at what you do."" Trust, but verify. Take to heart that expression from President Reagan.In other words, says Roxi Bahar Hewertson, author of ""Lead Like It Matters ... Because It Does,"" don't take business fundamentals for granted.She cites a couple of situations:""When you are the CEO of your own company, you talk to the CEO of other companies before committing, not to the second or third tier of management. You can talk to them first, but not last. If the CEO isn't committed in you and in fully understanding what you have to offer, you shouldn't be interested in that CEO's organization.""Also, ""make absolutely sure you have a formal letter of agreement and/or a contract signed before starting work or delivering product or services,"" she said. ""This means you'll most likely be paid as promised."" Set the example. The captain eats last, Hewertson reminds.""The leaders whom people will follow to the ends of the Earth are the ones who put themselves and their comfort last, not first,"" she said. ""When you own your business, you should get paid last. Be prepared to eat mac and cheese if that's what it takes.""I know a man who temporarily rented out his house and lived in the office of his business and with friends for six months just to make sure everyone else got paid."" Keep your promises. Make only the ones that you know you can deliver on or exceed, Hewertson said: ""Otherwise, no one will trust you, and trust is at the core of every relationship with every employee, vendor, partner or bank manager. I measure my success by how many of my clients tell me that I've exceeded their expectations.""

1150,MAC,"Worldwide tablet shipments recorded a year-over-year decline for the first time since the market's inception in 2010, research firm IDC reported Monday. Tablet shipments fell 3.2% in the fourth quarter from Q4 2013.Overall shipments for tablets and 2-in-1 devices reached 76.1 million units in Q4, IDC reported. For the year, tablet shipments rose 4.4% to 229.6 million units.Apple (AAPL) retained its lead with 28.1% market share in Q4, down from 33.1% a year earlier. It shipped 21.4 million iPads in the quarter, a decline of 17.8% year over year.Apple's latest generation iPad Air and iPad Mini products were incremental upgrades that failed to excite consumers. Meanwhile, its tablet business is being cannibalized by the larger-screen iPhone 6 series handsets and by Mac laptops, IDC says. Apple's iPhone 6 sales soared last quarter.Apple is rumored to be working on a jumbo-size iPad for enterprise and education markets to goose tablet sales. Photos of a back case for the supposed 12-inch iPad Pro were posted on a French tech blog last week, Business Insider reported. The current iPad lineup includes 7.9-inch and 9.7-inch tablets.Samsung held second place for tablets with 14.5% market share, down from 17.2% a year ago.

1151,MAC,"Housing: The homeownership rate continues to dive, wiping out the gains from last decade's housing boom. Many Americans have nothing to show for federal policies boosting homeownership — except huge debts.Since the housing crisis, which was caused by these policies, we figure that Washington has spent more than $3.5 trillion trying to buoy the sinking homeownership rate. Much of the Federal Reserve's quantitative easing went to buying U.S. housing agency debt and to keeping mortgage rates low.A lot of good that's done.Despite historically low interest rates and a multiyear recovery, homeownership remains depressed. In fact, the Census Bureau reported Thursday that the homeownership rate fell to a seasonally adjusted 63.9% in the fourth quarter from 64.3% the previous quarter.Last quarter's rate marks the lowest since the third quarter of 1994. By no coincidence, this happens to be the same time President Clinton launched his ""National Homeownership Strategy."" His goal was to boost homeownership among low-income or uncreditworthy minorities and close their ""mortgage gap"" with whites. But to do that, he had to reduce lending standards.He accomplished this by, among other things, ordering private banks regulated by the Community Reinvestment Act to adopt more ""flexible"" underwriting criteria, while pressuring HUD-controlled Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to cut down payment and credit requirements on loans they bought from mortgage originators.The crusade turned into a costly disaster, eventually destroying trillions of dollars in household wealth — most painfully for the minorities Clinton and his affordable-housing zealots deigned to help.Yes, Clinton managed to prop up the homeownership rate for African-Americans to nearly 50%. But a tsunami of foreclosures wiped out the sand castles he and his social engineers built in the black community.Now the black homeownership rate has sunk below 43%. And the homeownership gap supposedly ""dividing"" blacks and whites is at levels not seen in a century.The gains in homeownership were unsustainable because the demand was artificial, driven not by market principles but by federal policies that created perverse incentives in the market.The risky lending that government encouraged eventually popped the home price bubble, and sent the overall homeownership rate plunging from its 2004 peak of 69.4% to today's historically low 63.9%.The government's homeownership scheme, like so much of what the meddling do-gooders inside the Beltway do, was viewed as grand and noble — until it all came crashing down on everyone. They turned the American Dream into a nightmare.But the social engineers never learned their lesson. In fact, they're doubling down on their mistakes.President Obama and his top housing regulator, Mel Watt, are trying to rebuild homeownership, namely for foreclosed minorities, on the ruins of Fannie and Freddie. They've ordered the mortgage giants to back loans with just 3% down, even though low down-payment loans were among the first to default during the mortgage crisis.Wouldn't it be nice for a change if, instead of pushing folks into debt they can't afford, the government would just butt out of the housing market?

1152,MAC,"After a record-breaking holiday sales quarter, Apple (AAPL) faces Wall Street's ""What have you done for me lately?"" attitude.
"
1153,MAC,"Apple crushed expectations for its fiscal first quarter thanks to white-hot sales of its new iPhone 6 series smartphones. But analysts have already moved on to Apple's prospects ahead.
"
1154,MAC,"Apple stock was up 7.5% in afternoon trading on the stock market today in reaction to Apple's Q1 report late Tuesday, where it earned a record quarterly net profit of $18 billion. The stock had climbed as high as 118.12, up 8.2%, earlier in the session.
"
1155,MAC,"Here are five key takeaways from Apple's report.
"
1156,MAC,"1. Lots of growth left for iPhone 6 series
"
1157,MAC,"Apple sold 74.5 million iPhones in Q1, vs. consensus expectations of about 68 million. But it still has lots of growth potential for its iPhone 6 series handsets, Apple CEO Tim Cook said on a conference call with analysts.
"
1158,MAC,"First, only a small percentage of iPhone users — ""barely in the teens"" — have upgraded to iPhone 6, Cook said.
"
1159,MAC,"Second, Apple is seeing a good number of Google (GOOGL) Android phone users switching to iPhone, he said.
"
1160,MAC,"And finally, there are a lot of first-time smartphone buyers to attract, especially outside the U.S.
"
1161,MAC,"""We are incredibly bullish about iPhone going forward,"" Cook said.
"
1162,MAC,"Apple's iPhone business made up 69% of the company's total sales in the quarter ended Dec. 27.
"
1163,MAC,"Apple earned $3.06 a share, up 48% year over year, on sales of $74.6 billion, up 30%. Wall Street had forecast Apple to earn $2.60 a share on sales of $67.69 billion.
"
1164,MAC,"IPhone unit sales were up 46%. Average selling prices climbed $50 to $687, as consumers snapped up the pricier iPhone 6 Plus and models with more flash memory.
"
1165,MAC,"Apple's iPhone unit sales figure ""deserves all the adjectives analysts can muster,"" especially since Apple didn't reach supply-demand balance until January, said UBS analyst Steven Milunovich said in a note Wednesday.
"
1166,MAC,"But Nomura analyst Stuart Jeffrey noted the larger-than-expected sequential decline in iPhone units and revenue seen for the March quarter. He also is skeptical on the number of Android switchers. ""We still see no hard data to show very strong Android conquest sales,"" Jeffrey said in a note Wednesday.
"
1167,MAC,"2. Apple Watch to debut in April
"
1168,MAC,"Apple gave typically conservative guidance for the March quarter, in part because it won't include any sales of the company's upcoming Apple Watch smartwatch. Cook said the Apple Watch is expected to begin shipping in April.
"
1169,MAC,"For the March quarter, Apple expects sales of $53.5 billion, at the midpoint of guidance, a hair below Wall Street's target of $53.79 billion. It didn't provide an earnings forecast, but Wall Street is modeling for Apple to earn $2.01 a share, up 21%.
"
1170,MAC,"Cook said he has high expectations for the Apple Watch.
"
1171,MAC,"""I'm using it every day and love it and I can't live without it,"" he said. ""We're going to be thrilled to start shipping it, because we've got a lot of customers that are wanting to get one.""
"
1172,MAC,"Rosenblatt Securities analyst Brian Blair says Apple has already started production of the Apple Watch and will have a monthly run rate of 1.5 million units in the first half of the year, accelerating in the second half. He expects Apple to make 13 million to 15 million units this year.
"
1173,MAC,"3. The Year of Apple Pay
"
1174,MAC,"Cook said 2015 is shaping up as ""the year of Apple Pay,"" as the mobile e-payment service catches on with retailers, banks and consumers.
"
1175,MAC,"Just three months after its launch, Apple Pay accounts for more than $2 of every $3 spent on purchases using contactless payment across the three major U.S. card networks, Cook said. The rates are even higher in merchants that already accept Apple Pay, he said.
"
1176,MAC,"For instance, Apple Pay represents nearly 80% of mobile payment transactions at Panera Bread (PNRA) restaurants, Cook said.
"
1177,MAC,"""You can use Apple Pay up and down Main Street, to pick up a prescription at Walgreens or Duane Reade, get office or school supplies at Office Depot and Staples, and shop for groceries at national and regional stores from coast-to-coast, including Bi-Lo, Harveys, Save Mart, Wegmans Food Markets, Whole Foods and Winn-Dixie among others,"" Cook said.
"
1178,MAC,"On Tuesday, USA Technologies (USAT) announced its rollout of Apple Pay at nearly 200,000 self-service retail locations nationwide, including vending machines, parking pay stations and commercial laundry machines.
"
1179,MAC,"4. IBM partnership could boost iPad sales
"
1180,MAC,"Apple's iPad unit sales fell 18% to 21.4 million tablets in the December quarter. But Cook is still bullish about the category.
"
1181,MAC,"First-time buyer rates for the iPad are still 50% in developed markets like the U.S., he said. In China, over 70% of iPad customers are first-time buyers. It's clear from those statistics that the market isn't saturated, he said.
"
1182,MAC,"Plus, customer satisfaction ratings for the iPad are ""off the charts"" and usage data are very strong, Cook said.
"
1183,MAC,"To date, the iPad has been largely a consumer product, but Apple and IBM (IBM) have partnered to increase tablet usage in large enterprises.
"
1184,MAC,"""The work that we have going on in the enterprise is profound,"" Cook said. ""We're really going to change the way people work.""
"
1185,MAC,"To do that, Apple and IBM are spurring the creation of apps written for specific jobs, not just general productivity apps like word processing, spreadsheets and presentation tools.
"
1186,MAC,"In December, the partnership delivered the first 10 iOS apps for banking, retail, insurance, financial services, telecommunications, governments and airlines. Another 12 apps will be released this quarter, including apps for three new industries: health care, energy and utilities, and industrial products. They are on track to have over 100 enterprise apps by the end of 2015, Cook said.
"
1187,MAC,"Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi said iPad sales will be difficult for Apple to grow ""unless it introduces a converged notebook-tablet offering.""
"
1188,MAC,"Apple has been rumored to be developing a jumbo-size iPad with a 12-inch screen for enterprise and education markets.
"
1189,MAC,"5. Mac sales way outperform PC market
"

1193,MAC,"Apple also noted that it has sold 25 million Apple TV set-top boxes to date. Cook said Apple is continuing to evaluate the product category to find a way to make a ""greater contribution"" to the market.After a record-breaking holiday sales quarter, Apple (AAPL) faces Wall Street's ""What have you done for me lately?"" attitude.Apple crushed expectations for its fiscal first quarter thanks to white-hot sales of its new iPhone 6 series smartphones. But analysts have already moved on to Apple's prospects ahead.Apple stock was up 7.5% in afternoon trading on the stock market today in reaction to Apple's Q1 report late Tuesday, where it earned a record quarterly net profit of $18 billion. The stock had climbed as high as 118.12, up 8.2%, earlier in the session.Here are five key takeaways from Apple's report.1. Lots of growth left for iPhone 6 seriesApple sold 74.5 million iPhones in Q1, vs. consensus expectations of about 68 million. But it still has lots of growth potential for its iPhone 6 series handsets, Apple CEO Tim Cook said on a conference call with analysts.First, only a small percentage of iPhone users — ""barely in the teens"" — have upgraded to iPhone 6, Cook said.Second, Apple is seeing a good number of Google (GOOGL) Android phone users switching to iPhone, he said.And finally, there are a lot of first-time smartphone buyers to attract, especially outside the U.S.""We are incredibly bullish about iPhone going forward,"" Cook said.Apple's iPhone business made up 69% of the company's total sales in the quarter ended Dec. 27.Apple earned $3.06 a share, up 48% year over year, on sales of $74.6 billion, up 30%. Wall Street had forecast Apple to earn $2.60 a share on sales of $67.69 billion.IPhone unit sales were up 46%. Average selling prices climbed $50 to $687, as consumers snapped up the pricier iPhone 6 Plus and models with more flash memory.Apple's iPhone unit sales figure ""deserves all the adjectives analysts can muster,"" especially since Apple didn't reach supply-demand balance until January, said UBS analyst Steven Milunovich said in a note Wednesday.But Nomura analyst Stuart Jeffrey noted the larger-than-expected sequential decline in iPhone units and revenue seen for the March quarter. He also is skeptical on the number of Android switchers. ""We still see no hard data to show very strong Android conquest sales,"" Jeffrey said in a note Wednesday.2. Apple Watch to debut in AprilApple gave typically conservative guidance for the March quarter, in part because it won't include any sales of the company's upcoming Apple Watch smartwatch. Cook said the Apple Watch is expected to begin shipping in April.For the March quarter, Apple expects sales of $53.5 billion, at the midpoint of guidance, a hair below Wall Street's target of $53.79 billion. It didn't provide an earnings forecast, but Wall Street is modeling for Apple to earn $2.01 a share, up 21%.Cook said he has high expectations for the Apple Watch.""I'm using it every day and love it and I can't live without it,"" he said. ""We're going to be thrilled to start shipping it, because we've got a lot of customers that are wanting to get one.""Rosenblatt Securities analyst Brian Blair says Apple has already started production of the Apple Watch and will have a monthly run rate of 1.5 million units in the first half of the year, accelerating in the second half. He expects Apple to make 13 million to 15 million units this year.3. The Year of Apple PayCook said 2015 is shaping up as ""the year of Apple Pay,"" as the mobile e-payment service catches on with retailers, banks and consumers.Just three months after its launch, Apple Pay accounts for more than $2 of every $3 spent on purchases using contactless payment across the three major U.S. card networks, Cook said. The rates are even higher in merchants that already accept Apple Pay, he said.For instance, Apple Pay represents nearly 80% of mobile payment transactions at Panera Bread (PNRA) restaurants, Cook said.""You can use Apple Pay up and down Main Street, to pick up a prescription at Walgreens or Duane Reade, get office or school supplies at Office Depot and Staples, and shop for groceries at national and regional stores from coast-to-coast, including Bi-Lo, Harveys, Save Mart, Wegmans Food Markets, Whole Foods and Winn-Dixie among others,"" Cook said.On Tuesday, USA Technologies (USAT) announced its rollout of Apple Pay at nearly 200,000 self-service retail locations nationwide, including vending machines, parking pay stations and commercial laundry machines.4. IBM partnership could boost iPad salesApple's iPad unit sales fell 18% to 21.4 million tablets in the December quarter. But Cook is still bullish about the category.First-time buyer rates for the iPad are still 50% in developed markets like the U.S., he said. In China, over 70% of iPad customers are first-time buyers. It's clear from those statistics that the market isn't saturated, he said.Plus, customer satisfaction ratings for the iPad are ""off the charts"" and usage data are very strong, Cook said.To date, the iPad has been largely a consumer product, but Apple and IBM (IBM) have partnered to increase tablet usage in large enterprises.""The work that we have going on in the enterprise is profound,"" Cook said. ""We're really going to change the way people work.""To do that, Apple and IBM are spurring the creation of apps written for specific jobs, not just general productivity apps like word processing, spreadsheets and presentation tools.In December, the partnership delivered the first 10 iOS apps for banking, retail, insurance, financial services, telecommunications, governments and airlines. Another 12 apps will be released this quarter, including apps for three new industries: health care, energy and utilities, and industrial products. They are on track to have over 100 enterprise apps by the end of 2015, Cook said.Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi said iPad sales will be difficult for Apple to grow ""unless it introduces a converged notebook-tablet offering.""Apple has been rumored to be developing a jumbo-size iPad with a 12-inch screen for enterprise and education markets.5. Mac sales way outperform PC marketApple's Mac computer sales rose 14% to 5.5 million units in the December quarter, while the rest of the PC market declined.""We achieved double-digit year-over-year unit growth in both desktops and portables,"" Apple CFO Luca Maestri said. ""These results are truly remarkable, given the contraction in the global PC market, which IDC estimates declined by 3% in the quarter. We have now gained market share for 34 of the last 35 quarters.""Mac sales were aided by strong demand for the new iMac with Retina 5K display, Maestri said.Apple also noted that it has sold 25 million Apple TV set-top boxes to date. Cook said Apple is continuing to evaluate the product category to find a way to make a ""greater contribution"" to the market.

"
1208,MAC,"Cronyism: The Obama regime has quietly ordered Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to start donating hundreds of millions of dollars a year to a permanent affordable-housing slush fund for Democratic activist groups.Earlier this month, while few were paying attention, Federal Housing Finance Agency chief Mel Watt sent letters to the mortgage giants to ""set aside in each fiscal year 4.2 basis points of each dollar of unpaid principal balance of new business purchases to be allocated to the Housing Trust Fund and the Capital Magnet Fund.""That's a 0.042% tax to equip the funds. HUD will run the housing fund; the Treasury Department will run the capital fund.If the funds had been operating in 2010, when Fannie and Freddie together bought $856 billion in new mortgages, Fannie and Freddie would have pumped a whopping $360 million into the funds. Estimates put their total for fiscal 2015 at half a billion dollars.The money will help build apartments for extremely low-income Americans, says Watt, the former Congressional Black Caucus leader whom President Obama hand-picked to regulate Fannie and Freddie. The funds will also help the poor afford their own homes through down payments and other assistance.But nonprofit housing activist groups will distribute the funds. So count on money being diverted to ACORN fronts and clones, beholden to the Democratic Party, who in the past have laundered housing grant money to finance political campaigns.As we've reported previously, ACORN affiliates are still operational in New York and other cities, having renamed themselves after ACORN was busted for fraud and corruption during the 2008 presidential campaign. They're also still receiving HUD housing grants.In the past, these groups have used HUD grants to pressure banks to make ill-advised home loans that sped the mortgage crisis. Now a permanently funded war chest will aid their shakedown — courtesy of taxpayers still on the hook for Fannie and Freddie.The last thing the nation needs is another Washington scheme that further politicizes the lending and home-building markets. Yet rest assured that will be the end result of these national housing funds.Making matters worse, they're unaccountable to congressional appropriators, making them ripe for corruption and cronyism. We're talking about billions of dollars funneling through left-wing nonprofits and floating around in urban reinvestment projects sponsored by the likes of Rahm Emanuel and Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson.With this potential $500 million slush fund, moreover, the Obama regime is effectively turning Fannie and Freddie into off-budget welfare agencies — indeed, a self-sustaining shadow government for the left wing that will survive even Republican administrations.Now we know what the president really had in mind when he promised to ""reform"" the bankrupt mortgage giants.
"
1209,MAC,"Attracting first-time homebuyers might seem like courting a herd of underfed cats.Squeezed by tight credit, student debt and low wages, they're still the missing link to a robust housing recovery.But not for LGI Homes (NASDAQ:LGIH), a small homebuilder based near Houston. It sends 12,000 pieces of direct mail ""every single week"" to renters in complexes within 25 miles of one of its active communities, says CEO Eric Lipar.With homes selling for under $200,000 — the average in the past quarter was $166,000 — first-time buyers are the company's prime customers.They've been flocking to its communities, some 38 at last count, including markets in Texas, Arizona, Florida, Georgia and Colorado.About 95% of LGI buyers are renters. Their interest ""is triggered by getting a rental-notice increase,"" Lipar told IBD. ""Rising rents work to our advantage for sure.""LGI, which went public a year ago, closed sale on 2,110 homes through the end of November compared with 1,617 for all of 2013.""When a lot of builders were getting out of entry-level, we stuck with it, and we've always been profitable,"" Lipar said. ""Our plan is to stick with first-time buyers.""The company may see busier days, as could other builders aiming at first-timers, such as large-cap builder D.R. Horton (NYSE:DHI), with its low-priced Express Homes.At a little over 30% of the overall homebuying market, the share of first-time buyers in 2014 hit its lowest point in nearly 30 years, according to the National Association of Realtors (NAR).Homes Easier To Afford?Affordability is still an issue, but early signs are emerging of a better climate for first-time buyers, including an improving job market.For the three months ended in November, employment in America grew 2% year over year, the strongest rate since the first quarter of 2006. And the key first-time-buyer cohort — the missing 25- to 29-year-olds — showed a 3% gain.Though new jobs ""are not as high-paying as in the past, it's still acceleration,"" said Sam Khater, deputy chief economist with property researcher CoreLogic (NYSE:CLGX). ""So it should foreshadow an increase in demand for first-time buyers.""A second reason may also help: Institutional investors are leaving the market. That means ""less competition for starter homes,"" said Lawrence Yun, chief economist with the NAR.Investors paying all cash for starter homes had bid up prices, shutting out many first-time buyers. But price gains are decelerating.The latest S&P/Case-Shiller Home Price Indices show a slight drop in the 10- and 20-city composites in October vs. September. They still were up 4.4% and 4.5%, respectively, from a year earlier.""I call it a more organic market, less influenced by distressed sales and artificial support from quantitative easing"" by the Feds, Khater said. He added that ""2015 will really be the first year (in many) that both volumes and price movements will reflect fundamentals — meaning supply, demand and income.""That shift is ""beginning to be reflected in home prices,"" he said.Markets On The MoveKhater notes that many markets with the biggest price gains in 2014 had the strongest underlying economies, based especially on technology and energy industries.Pricey San Francisco, a leading tech center, showed the biggest monthly gain of all 20 cities in Case-Shiller's latest survey, at nearly 1% in October over September.Khater points out that lower-priced homes are seeing faster growth than higher-end homes in the top 25 U.S. housing markets, reflecting tight supply and a lack of new construction for single-family starter homes.Some markets, such as those in the Carolinas and Texas, are seeing robust construction and sales trends, he says.Falling oil prices may make energy-capital Houston — one of the country's hottest home markets recently — and other Texas markets ""vulnerable"" to a slowdown in new oil-related jobs in 2015, says the NAR's Yun.Still, the Lone Star State is diversified, ""so it may be able to withstand the potential decline because other sectors of the economy continue to show strength,"" he said. Also, Texas has more affordable homes relative to many other housing markets around the nation.Jobs And Sun Belt MigrationYun sees housing demand growing in Rocky Mountain states such as Colorado and Utah, thanks to strong job growth.Meanwhile, Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas are benefiting from corporate relocations as well as retirees moving in.""I see opportunities on two ends,"" said John Burns, CEO of John Burns Real Estate Consulting in Irvine, Calif.""The entry-level buyer will come back, though more slowly than most people think,"" he said. ""And the older buyer — the retiree — is already back and buying homes, a lot of them paying all cash.""Today's generation of first-time buyers are older than their predecessors because they have delayed marriage and having children, Burns says.""The ultimate impetus (for buying a first home) is when you need to put a child into a school. We're seeing more of those buyers,"" he said.Still waiting to make their move are many buyers who bought entry-level homes in the early 2000s and saw their homes plummet in value during the housing downturn. Now largely in their early 40s, they don't have enough equity to move, Burns says.He expects that older baby boomers will continue to support the housing market in 2015 and beyond as they sell their homes at a profit and then use the cash to buy other homes.""We're seeing active-adult communities pop up all over the country,"" Burns said. ""They're doing great.""Especially active on that front is homebuilder PulteGroup (NYSE:PHM), with its Del Webb Communities.In a report this week, analyst Jay McCanless of Sterne Agee said he prefers builders ""who concentrate on older, move-up buyers bringing equity from their previous home to the closing table.""His top picks among that group are PulteGroup, WCI Communities (NYSE:WCIC) and Ryland Group (NYSE:RYL).New low-down-payment programs from Fannie Mae (OTCBB:FNMA) and Freddie Mac (OTCBB:FMCC) may spur healthy order growth for eligible first-time buyers in 2015, he noted, ""if originators take the bait.""He expects the lack of mortgage availability for first-time and subprime buyers to continue into 2015 ""because we do not believe banks are being compensated for the tail risk on mortgages.""Still, slower price appreciation opens up opportunities for potential new homebuyers after months and years of robust price gains ""acted to squeeze out new buyers,"" noted Lindsey Piegza, chief economist with Sterne Agee, in a report this week.""Slower price gains and still historically low interest rates (around 4%) may work to encourage new demand in 2015,"" she wrote.Housing watchers don't expect the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates much, if at all, in the near term, perhaps not until mid-2015 at the earliest.Meanwhile, CEO Lipar of LGI Homes is counting on more first-time buyers to come his way as they ""save more and work on their credit scores.""""Demand will always be there from people who rent,"" he said.

1211,MAC,"It hasn't been the warmest climate for private mortgage insurers as many potential first-time homebuyers either have shied away from ownership or haven't been able to qualify for mortgage loans.Still, that hasn't stopped private mortgage insurer Essent Group (ESNT) from seeing a rise in business.Essent, via its wholly owned subsidiary Essent Guaranty, offers private mortgage insurance for single-family mortgage loans. Since going public in October 2013, it's logged at least double-digit profit growth in all but one quarter.Wary BuyersIn the third quarter, Essent's earnings climbed 61% from the prior year to 29 cents a share. Revenue shot up 77% to $64.6 million. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect full-year earnings of $1.02 a share. That figure should fatten to $1.60 in 2015 and $2.13 in 2016.Such growth is pretty impressive, considering that it comes amidst a not-so-buoyant mortgage market.First-time home buyers, who are prime candidates for mortgages and private mortgage insurance, have remained at 29% of all buyers for four straight months and under 30% for the past 18 of the past 19 months, according to the National Association of Realtors. The historical average is around 40%.Like its peers, Essent fills a void in the mortgage market. Government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are restricted from purchasing or guaranteeing loans with less than a 20% down payment not covered by credit protections.Private mortgage insurers provide credit protection to lenders and mortgage investors ""by covering a portion of the unpaid principal balance of a mortgage in the event of a default,"" according to an Essent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. They help ""extend affordable homeownership by facilitating the sale of low-down-payment loans into the secondary market,"" the filing added.But Essent differs from rival private mortgage insurers such as Radian Group (RDN) and Genworth Financial (GNW), analysts say, and that difference gives it an edge.Essent was founded in 2008 and capitalized by investors such as Goldman Sachs Group (GS) and billionaire George Soros's Valorina. The original investors wanted to create a new mortgage company that was not exposed to the bad legacy loans wrought by the financial crisis that caused many private mortgage insurers to struggle.The firm wrote its first policy in May 2010, so it doesn't have mortgage insurance written before 2009 on its books. As a result, Essent is not exposed to the low-quality mortgage loans made during the housing bubble and bust.""Essent filled a vacuum,"" said Macquarie Securities analyst Sean Dargan. ""It had a clean balance sheet with no (legacy loans) and a strong financial strength rating that is higher than that of Radian, MGIC Investment (MTG) and Genworth.""BTIG Research analyst Mark Palmer makes a similar point, saying that Essent's book of business ""is comprised of 2010 and later vintage (loans) that are high quality and attractively priced.""Mortgage lending standards were more stringent in 2010 than during the financial crisis, so Essent is providing insurance for ""high-quality underwritten policies,"" Palmer said.In 2010, Essent Guaranty became the first private mortgage insurer that the GSEs have approved since 1995. Essent is licensed to write coverage in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.""Its financial strength is reflected by its credit rating,"" said Palmer.Moody's Investors Service rates Essent Baa2 with a stable outlook, and Standard & Poor's Rating Services rates it BBB+ with a stable outlook.Meanwhile, the company keeps growing, even in a stagnant mortgage market.Since writing its first policy in 2010, Essent estimates that it has grown its share of the private mortgage insurance market to about 14%. The growth is based on new insurance written on a flow basis — in which loans are insured in individual, loan-by-loan transactions — for the nine months ended Sept. 30. The most recent market-share estimate compares to a share of 12.1% for the year ended Dec. 31, 2013.""Essent is growing its book at a faster pace because it's starting from scratch,"" Dargan said. ""It's a new company with adequate capital that's taking market share from some of its weaker competitors.""In the third quarter, Essent's net premiums earned for the third quarter of 2014 rose to $60.3 million from $50.3 million the prior quarter and $34.3 million the previous year.Its expense ratio fell to 40.6% from 47% the prior quarter and 53.2% the prior year. The expense ratio is calculated by dividing other underwriting and operating expenses by net premiums earned.'Extremely Low' Default RateThe percentage of loans in default as of Sept. 30 was 0.15%, compared with 0.13% as of June 30 and 0.09% as of Sept. 30, 2013.Palmer says that a 0.15% default rate is ""extremely low.""Still, Essent's stock performance has been volatile. Shares traded as high as 24.99 in February, fell below 18 in August and currently trade near 24.""Part of the volatility is due to the fact that the mortgage market has been less than robust,"" Palmer said. ""If a company generates its revenue and profits through underwriting insurance on mortgages, there needs to be more mortgages generated for them to do better.""In terms of the climate for Essent's business, the primary mortgage market hasn't ""taken off yet,"" Palmer said. ""We're still seeing mortgage activity at relatively modest levels.""Essent is a part of IBD's Finance-Mortgage & Related Services industry group, which also includes CoreLogic (CLGX), HFF (HF) and Ladder Capital (LADR). Essent has a 72 Composite Rating out of a possible 99.

The conspiracy helped protect some of the Democrats' biggest stars from scrutiny and accountability while helping justify the biggest government takeover of the financial sector since the New Deal.
"
1216,MAC,"Wallison's sobering, trenchantly written ""Hidden in Plain Sight: What Really Caused the World's Worst Financial Crisis and Why It Could Happen Again"" reveals that the Democrat-led panel buried key data proving that the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and other federal agencies pushed the housing market over the subprime cliff.

The fix seemed to be in, and Wallison's account of the inner workings of the 10-member body confirms it. Here's what took place during the FCIC's 18-month, $10 million probe:
"
1218,MAC," Angelides provided no staff to help Wallison and other Republicans interview witnesses, conduct research or draft the report. But commission Democrats were assigned almost 80 staffers to help formulate their single theory that bank risk-taking and greed unleashed by deregulation caused the crisis.
"
1219,MAC," Angelides never notified Wallison or other commissioners about the hundreds of witnesses he called to testify in closed-door interviews with his staff, denying them the chance to cross-examine the witnesses.
"
1220,MAC," Staffers failed to put these private witnesses under oath, even though the final report was based almost exclusively on their testimony with little or no documents or data to back up their statements, which simply validated the Democrat narrative.
"
1221,MAC," Angelides buried evidence revealing that by 2008, three in four high-risk mortgages wound up on the books of HUD-controlled Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac or agencies such as the Federal Housing Administration. A data-rich memo by former Fannie Mae chief credit officer Ed Pinto proved that government, not the private sector, drove risky lending. But Pinto's research ""was never formally made available by the chair or staff to the other members of the FCIC,"" Wallison writes.
"
1222,MAC," Angelides withheld the final draft of the report from Wallison and other commissioners until eight days before sending it to the printer, never giving them the time they needed to go over the wording or content of the almost 900-page draft.
"

1228,MAC,"A corrupt investigation led to corrupt reforms. What we need now, in light of Wallison's revelations, is an investigation of the investigation, along with a top-to-bottom review of Dodd-Frank rules. It's necessary that Republicans hold public hearings so Americans will know how they were lied to about the crisis and how they're being led down the garden path.Subprime Scandal: We've long suspected the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission wasn't honest in examining events before the meltdown. But an ex-commissioner says the probe was actually a full-blown political cover-up.In a just-released book, former FCIC member Peter Wallison says that a Democratic Congress worked with the commission's Democratic chairman to whitewash the government's central role in the mortgage debacle. The conspiracy helped protect some of the Democrats' biggest stars from scrutiny and accountability while helping justify the biggest government takeover of the financial sector since the New Deal.Wallison's sobering, trenchantly written ""Hidden in Plain Sight: What Really Caused the World's Worst Financial Crisis and Why It Could Happen Again"" reveals that the Democrat-led panel buried key data proving that the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and other federal agencies pushed the housing market over the subprime cliff. The final FCIC report put the blame squarely on Wall Street.In 2009, then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi appointed her California pal Phil Angelides, a long-time Democrat operative, to lead the commission. The fix seemed to be in, and Wallison's account of the inner workings of the 10-member body confirms it. Here's what took place during the FCIC's 18-month, $10 million probe: Angelides provided no staff to help Wallison and other Republicans interview witnesses, conduct research or draft the report. But commission Democrats were assigned almost 80 staffers to help formulate their single theory that bank risk-taking and greed unleashed by deregulation caused the crisis. Angelides never notified Wallison or other commissioners about the hundreds of witnesses he called to testify in closed-door interviews with his staff, denying them the chance to cross-examine the witnesses. Staffers failed to put these private witnesses under oath, even though the final report was based almost exclusively on their testimony with little or no documents or data to back up their statements, which simply validated the Democrat narrative. Angelides buried evidence revealing that by 2008, three in four high-risk mortgages wound up on the books of HUD-controlled Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac or agencies such as the Federal Housing Administration. A data-rich memo by former Fannie Mae chief credit officer Ed Pinto proved that government, not the private sector, drove risky lending. But Pinto's research ""was never formally made available by the chair or staff to the other members of the FCIC,"" Wallison writes. Angelides withheld the final draft of the report from Wallison and other commissioners until eight days before sending it to the printer, never giving them the time they needed to go over the wording or content of the almost 900-page draft. After Wallison filed a 43,000-word dissent, Angelides removed all but 9,000 words of it from the report widely distributed in bookstores.Angelides effectively censored any hard evidence that the government's housing policies were the predominant cause of the financial crisis.

1230,MAC,"Politics: If only Sen. Elizabeth Warren had the same passion for sticking it to Washington-controlled Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac for their ""reckless gambling"" as she has for attacking Wall Street banks.Warren last week took to her socialist soapbox to try to torpedo the ""cromnibus"" spending bill. She warned legislators they would be blamed for another financial crisis if they dared to vote for any appropriations legislation that includes anti-Dodd-Frank provisions.Pontificating from the Senate floor Thursday, Warren railed against Republicans and fellow Democrats alike for adding a provision to the bill to restore to banks the right to use derivatives to hedge risks for customers.She claimed repeal of the regulation ""would let derivatives traders on Wall Street gamble with taxpayer money and get bailed out by the government when their risky bets threaten to blow up our financial system.""Added Warren: ""These are the same banks that nearly broke the economy in 2008 and destroyed millions of jobs. The same banks that got bailed out by taxpayers and are now raking in record profits.""A vote for this bill is a vote for taxpayer bailouts of Wall Street,"" she continued.But where was she three days earlier, when Fannie and Freddie unveiled new low-income mortgages with just 3% down payments? The move encourages the kind of risky lending that actually caused the crisis, yet she didn't say a peep.The new loan program, announced Monday, reverses a trend toward tighter lending standards by the mortgage giants since their own taxpayer bailout. Federal studies show low down payments are one of the chief causes of loan defaults.These risky bets will go sour in the next downturn. So here we go again. But Warren doesn't care.She insists ""risky derivatives trades were the main culprit in the 2008 financial crisis,"" and repealing limits on them would ""pose serious risks to our entire economy.""Spewing her usual class-warfare rhetoric, she added that the House ""slipped"" the rider into the spending bill for the benefit of ""the rich and powerful,"" because it ""works for the millionaires and billionaires.""Get a grip, Liz.The ""main culprit"" in the housing crisis was Fannie and Freddie and their mission regulator, HUD, which was cheered on by affordable-housing zealots in the House like Warren's pal Barney Frank.HUD pressured Fannie and Freddie to make high-risk loans to ""underserved"" borrowers, and to do that they had to lower their underwriting standards to the point where they were buying as many subprime loans as prime. While HUD was enforcing its affordable-housing quotas, down payments plunged along with credit scores.When the housing price bubble burst, those loans were the first to default. When the music stopped, a whopping 77% of all the bad loans ended up on the books of Fannie and Freddie and other federal agencies — not Wall Street banks.The evidence of government guilt in the crisis is overwhelming. Yet Warren keeps up the false narrative.For her own evidence, she quotes Americans for Financial Reform, a socialist group she helped set up. This same group plants its radical organizers at her hearings, where they cheer on her Marxist harangues against banks.Warren clearly has an anti-bank, anti-market agenda. She's on record calling for a cap on interest rates and other radical ideas. If she could, she'd turn banks into public utilities.Even some in the media are a little leery.Take CBS News host Bob Schieffer, who in a recent interview with Warren remarked: ""You know, your fans say you're a populist, but your critics say you're just basically a socialist.""Warren tried to laugh it off — ""I just don't know where they get that!"" But she's not fooling anybody.

1231,MAC,"Regulation: A hidden nugget in the massive proposed budget bill weakens the 2010 Dodd-Frank law's limits on banks' use of financial derivatives. Great idea. Let's hope it's a first step to repeal of the Wall Street reform act.The move to restore to banks the right to use derivatives to hedge risks for customers has bipartisan support in Congress. But the far-left wing of the Democratic Party hates it as a giveaway to their all-purpose bogeymen, ""Wall Street"" and ""big banks.""They warn that, by restoring banks' ability to use derivatives, the U.S. risks another financial meltdown. Typical was the comment made this week by former Rep. Barney Frank, who called the move ""a road map for the stealth unwinding of financial reform.""We certainly hope so. Dodd-Frank is one of the worst pieces of legislation to come down the pike in recent years, part of an Obama-era regulatory siege that continues today. Changing its provisions or repealing the law entirely should be a priority of the next Congress.The derivatives legislation is a classic example of regulatory excess resulting from a false narrative, set up by Democrats during the debate over the financial crisis.At the time, Frank and others argued vehemently that it was Republican-era financial deregulation that caused the financial crisis, and that Dodd-Frank would reduce risks.Since the bill passed in 2010, we've had the worst economic recovery in our nation's history. It's a pathetic law that should never have been passed.As for the canard that deregulation was to blame for the financial crisis, that story line has been thoroughly debunked. ""The crisis was caused by the government's own housing policies, which fostered the creation of 25 million subprime and other low-quality mortgages — almost 50% of all mortgages in the United States — that are now defaulting at unprecedented rates,"" wrote Peter Wallison of the American Enterprise Institute in 2009 after presciently warning in the early 2000s of a financial crisis .Three-quarters of all the bad mortgages in the country in 2008 were owned by government agencies, mainly the toxic twins Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac — not private banks. When the 1997-2007 housing bubble popped, both Fannie and Freddie went bankrupt, dragging the financial system down with them.Another myth, that Glass-Steagall bank regulations were ""repealed,"" as some Democrats insist, is also false. They're still on the books. Yes, banks and some financial houses suffered big losses on their derivative portfolios. But that wasn't due to deregulation; it was because the government forced banks to make bad home loans.By getting rid of Dodd-Frank's punitive derivative rules, banks can once again hedge reasonable risks for customers and their own portfolios — something big financial companies, industrial firms and even farms do routinely and safely. This will lower costs across the economy and keep money flowing to those who need it.Meantime, it's time we stop demonizing the finance industry and rein in our out-of-control government instead. Taking a whack at Dodd-Frank is a good start.

1277,MAC,"The debate over Federal Reserve policy and Quantitative Easing has been framed in terms of technical economic issues. More than 50 years ago, Milton Friedman recognized that monetary policy involves broader political and constitutional issues.If we are to move beyond the debate over QE, we must go back to Friedman's classical liberal case for a constitutionally constrained Fed.Friedman is the most well-known proponent of rules in monetary policy, as opposed to discretion. His technical argument centered on the knowledge requirements for implementing discretionary monetary policy.Effective monetary policy is not a question of having enough economic data. Central bankers are drowning in data. The problem is that even the most up-to-date data are merely recent economic history. They do not reflect the current state of the economy, much less the future.To determine optimal monetary policy, one must know future economic conditions. Time elapses between the collection of economic data and decision-making by central bankers. The Federal Open Market Committee meets eight times per year with about six weeks between meetings. (Emergency meetings can be held by phone.)A lot can happen in an economy in six weeks, as we saw repeatedly in 2008. Think of the bailout of Bear Stearns in March; Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac lurching through the summer to conservatorship on Sept. 7; and the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers on Sept. 15.To have had the ""right"" monetary policy in place for the summer of 2008 would have required that the FOMC act earlier in the year on data they did not yet possess. There is a lag (time lapse) between the implementation of monetary policy and its effects. So the correct monetary policy must be in place before events transpire.If one reads the FOMC minutes for the first half of 2008, Chairman Ben Bernanke's speeches and the chairman's testimony to Congress, it is clear that he and other members of the FOMC were clueless about the economic situation they would face in a few short weeks and months.That is not a cheap shot, but the essence of the argument against discretionary monetary policy. It requires central bankers to predict a future that is inherently unknowable.Even many critics of Fed policy accept the need for the first QE in November 2008. Actually, the Fed was late to the game. There was a growing liquidity crisis building throughout the summer.In that period, however, the Fed was sterilizing its lending to troubled financial institutions with offsetting open-market operations. The Fed actually came close to repeating the mistakes of the 1930s. And this happened under the chairmanship of a scholar of the Great Depression.Once again, my criticism is neither of the man nor even of the institution.There will be another year like 2008, with different fact patterns, and the Fed will once again make mistakes, though perhaps different ones. The argument for rules is that the sum of such errors will be smaller if the Fed follows a rule rather than engages in discretionary monetary policy.Friedman also offered a second, political argument on the rule of law. To the argument for a rule, proponents of discretion invariably respond that we can do better than rigid adherence to a rule.In ""Capitalism and Freedom"" (1962), Friedman observed that one could with a few word changes make the same argument against the First Amendment and the entire Bill of Rights. ""Is it not absurd, one might say, to have a standard proscription to interference with free speech?""Discretionary proscriptions on speech would create huge uncertainty about what speech is permissible and what is not. It would also violate the very concept of a right. It would be the difference between living in Russia and in the U.S.Friedman strengthened his rule-of-law argument by noting how much power monetary discretion puts in the hands of a few men. In his words, ""it is a bad system to believers in freedom.""The case for a monetary rule is one with the case for legal and constitutional rules generally. The Madisonian vision is not a political system that enables good men to do great things. It is a system that prevents ordinary men from causing great harm to their fellow citizens.How does this affect the debate over QE? The evidence for its being beneficial on net is thin. But that is a backward-looking argument. Friedman's argument is a forward-looking one. How do we avoid another Great Recession and thus the apparent need for extraordinary monetary policy?In recent years, Stanford University economist John Taylor has been a torch-bearer of the argument for a monetary rule. His work updated and added to Friedman's work. Thanks to Taylor and others, there is a bill before Congress to implement a rule.The ""Federal Reserve Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014"" requires the Fed to follow a rule. The default rule is the eponymous Taylor Rule. The Fed can choose another one, but must follow some rule.There is any number of alternative rules. The Cato Institute recently established a Center for Monetary and Financial Alternatives to analyze systematically the alternatives. The economic arguments for a rule of some kind are compelling. But so, too, are the political and constitutional ones.In monetary policy, as elsewhere, the rule of law should govern. O'Driscoll is a senior fellow at the Cato Institute and former vice president at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.

1337,MAC,"From flat income growth to housing crash nightmares, potential first-time homebuyers possess plenty of reasons to shy from ownership, a trend that could aggravate weakening home price appreciation.The National Association of Realtors (NAR) early this month said that first-time homebuyers accounted for 33% of the market in its latest annual survey, a year-over-year drop of five percentage points and well below the long-term average of 40%.It's the lowest first-timer participation rate since 1987, and it coincides with the NAR's forecast that 4.9 million home sales in 2014 will fall 200,000 short of last year's total. Among impediments, the NAR and other observers say that student debt burdens and rising rents hinder the ability of young adults to save for a down payment.What's more, many young professionals are underemployed. Those who have landed jobs haven't enjoying the same wage growth as baby boomers and Generation X, says Stan Humphries, chief economist for Seattle-based online housing marketplace Zillow (Z).Those demand suppressors may require home sellers to dial back price expectations, particularly in the short term.""Assuming that income growth returns to normal, it won't have any long-term impact,"" said Humphries, referring to the dearth of first-time homebuyers. ""But right now we are having trouble getting income growth back to normal, and we can't have a functional economy or a functional housing market without it.""Paycheck DoldrumsPrivate-sector average hourly wages haven't increased more than about 2% annually the past few years, and growth in 2014 is on pace to continue the trend, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.In addition to enduring miserly income expansion and other demand inhibitors, millennials are also avoiding marriage and baby rearing, which typically lead to home purchases, Humphries says.After increasing 19% from the trough in February 2012 to the end of 2013, home price appreciation across 20 major cities has been slowing for a large part of this year, according to the most recent S&P/Case-Shiller Home Price Indices.Average year-over-year appreciation of 5.5% in August was 110 basis points lower than the annual gain in July, according to the report. Moreover, price growth in August was just 0.2%, compared with 0.6% in July.""We've had a nice period of growth in home prices,"" said Daren Blomquist, a vice president of Irvine, Calif.-based RealtyTrac, a provider of housing data and analytics. ""But I think we're going into a period of stagnant price appreciation, and the only thing that could change that is if incomes went up.""Few ChoicesPart of the decelerating price increases can be traced to single-family home investors pulling back in the bellwether markets of Phoenix, Southern California and Atlanta, among others, Blomquist says.Aggressive investors primarily acquired entry-level homes and pushed up prices as much as 30% in some markets, he says. That in turn helped many ""underwater"" homeowners — those with more mortgage debt than the home is worth — return to positive equity.But ballooning price appreciation priced many entry-level buyers out of the market, adds Blomquist, who estimates that 8 million homeowners are still underwater, down from 13 million a couple of years ago.The still-large number of underwater homeowners is crimping supply, Humphries says, because a majority live in entry-level houses and can't sell them.""Even if buyers have navigated the demand issues — they have a decent job with a decent wage, and are married and having kids and want to buy a home,"" Humphries said, ""the number of homes available is dramatically less than it was pre-recession.""Low Down PaymentsBlomquist is skeptical about the effectiveness of a plan that Federal Housing Finance Agency head Mel Watt has introduced, which would allow Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FMCC) to purchase home loans that are made to ""lower-wealth borrowers"" who make a 3% down payment.The Federal Housing Administration already has a 3% down payment program, and Fannie and Freddie can now buy mortgages with as little as a 5% down payment, he says.A recent RealtyTrac study also found that, even with a 3% down payment, would-be buyers with a median income and an average student or car loan would be able to afford a monthly mortgage payment in only 48% of U.S. counties. Without debt, 92% of the counties would be affordable.""In my mind, the biggest thing weighing down first-time homebuyers right now is debt,"" Blomquist said.Homebuilders Stepping UpFederal agencies aren't alone in their efforts to stimulate home buying, however. Forth Worth, Texas-based D.R. Horton (DHI) is rolling out its Express Homes division in the Southwest, Texas and the Southeast, focusing on attracting entry-level purchasers for homes priced around $150,000.Meanwhile, LGI Homes (LGIH), based in The Woodlands, Texas, is solely focused on the entry-level homebuyer in virtually the same regions. It not only offers homes for around $165,000 but also provides credit counseling and no-down-payment financing for qualified homebuyers.Homebuilders of late have generally focused on building much pricier homes, particularly given that lots entitled for development have escalated in cost, says Jody Kahn, senior vice president of Irvine-based John Burns Real Estate Consulting, an independent housing industry researcher and consulting firm.""But a lot of builders are anxious to see a return of the first-time homebuyer segment,"" said Kahn, who conducts monthly surveys of 225 homebuilding executives from the firm's Portsmouth, N.H., office. ""Even builders that don't cater 100% to the entry-level buyer say that they're seeing an uptick in entry-level traffic, which is a step in the right direction.""
"
1338,MAC,"Credit Standards: Last month, while all eyes were on the election, Obama regulators quietly pulled off a hat trick on the easy-credit front. Their reckless actions may lead the nation into another financial crisis.First, six regulatory agencies led by the powerful Consumer Financial Protection Bureau officially watered down standards for home loans packaged and sold to investors and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as securities. Mortgages with no down payment, weak credit and high debt-to-income ratios will face no legal liability.These are the same ingredients that polluted mortgage-back securities before the crisis. Only now, MBS with subprime standards won't be labeled subprime. They'll carry the government seal of approval — qualified residential mortgage — and few will be the wiser.It's former Housing and Urban Development chief Andrew Cuomo's 2000 dream come true: to obliterate the difference between a prime and a subprime mortgage.After SEC commissioners objected to the lax lending rules, President Obama called them into the White House and browbeat them into submission. Plus, radical community organizers bombarded the agencies with more than 10,000 form letters complaining that stricter mortgage requirements would deny low-income minorities access to credit.""At the same time we did this rule-making — and believe me, it was planned this way — (it was) announced that Fannie and Freddie will now be loosening their standards to provide more credit,"" warned Daniel Gallagher, one of the dissenting SEC commissioners.In fact, Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Mel Watt last month told mortgage bankers that Fannie and Freddie will resume their risky, precrisis practice of buying mortgages with as little as 3% down and ""less-than-perfect credit."" The fed-controlled mortgage giants set the standards by which loans are made.Then, last week, Watt added the grease on the slippery slope of credit-loosening. On Oct. 28, he began finalizing a regulation slapping new ""affordable housing"" quotas on Fannie and Freddie, which before the crisis bought millions of subprime mortgages and securities to meet those quotas.According to the proposed rule, Watt will force Fannie and Freddie to devote more of their mortgage portfolios to ""very low-income"" borrowers in high-minority census tracts.Why? To help close ""the gap between the homeownership rates for white and black households.""So, in the name of diversity, the administration is ordering Fannie and Freddie to accept higher shares of substandard mortgages from uncreditworthy applicants. Never mind that these same misguided social goals plunged the toxic twins into the subprime abyss.So here we go again, mortgage crisis deja vu — financial reform be damned.The Obama regime has managed to take the very policies that caused the last crisis and cynically adopt them as the government's official plan for avoiding the next.

1350,MAC,"Soon after she became a financial adviser in the mid-1980s, Cicily Maton met a 21-year-old client who had suddenly inherited a substantial sum. He sought Maton's advice on what to do next.""He was this shy young man with a nothing job,"" recalled Maton, founder and president of Aequus Wealth Management in Chicago.Maton sensed that her wayward client could use some direction. Given his interest in becoming an artist, she advised him to set aside between $10,000 and $15,000 to delve into computers.""I told him to take a portion of his windfall to explore Apple Computer,"" she said. ""So he bought a Mac and fooled around with it. A few months later, he brought me a brochure for my firm that he had designed on the computer.""Now a successful graphic designer, he credits Maton for steering him through a confusing transition in his life.For Maton, a big part of her practice is guiding people through rough transitions — and helping them come out the other side as more fulfilled individuals with their financial and emotional health intact. The transitions can be jarring but welcome, such as inheriting vast wealth, or can involve the devastating loss of a spouse or a job.Maton often finds that clients who undergo major upheavals tend to lose their bearings, at least temporarily. She serves as a sounding board and trusted ally to help them talk through the next phase of their lives.""You have to believe in your client,"" she said. ""They sense that you believe they can do it even if they don't believe in themselves.""Maton, who founded her firm in 1987, knows that clients in the process of transitioning into a new life stage face particular challenges. Uprooted from their long-held identity, they're often fragile.""Their confidence is low, and they don't feel that they can tackle new changes,"" Maton said. ""They'll say, 'I can't do this' or 'I can't change.'""But Maton gently prods them to rethink their attitude and approach. Rather than lecture them, she likes to open their minds by engaging in supportive dialogue.Applying ""appreciative inquiry"" principles to pose positive questions and enable clients to embrace change, Maton resists declarative statements and sweeping judgments. Instead, she favors what she calls ""conversational engagement.""Citing insights that she's gained from Edward Jacobson, a psychologist who advises financial planners, Maton builds trust with clients by probing to learn how they're handling a transition. She might list common problems that can arise, such as decreasing ability to concentrate and increasing anxiety, and ask, ""Have you experienced any of these things?""That works better than telling clients, ""You're not coping well"" or ""You are too attached to the past. You need to let go.""Maton's focus on counseling clients during transitions in their lives evolved from her own experience. In 1982, her 19-year marriage ended in divorce, and she wondered how to proceed.Then in her mid-40s and a fundraiser for politicians, Maton decided to reinvent herself by establishing a financial advisory career. Today, she says that she recounts her ability ""to recreate my life"" to reassure shaken clients that they can do it too.One of the most upsetting transitions that anyone can face is losing a job. The abrupt nature of some layoffs makes it sting even more.Maton's freshly unemployed clients sometimes confide in her that they dread facing friends and family. It's just too painful to admit that they are jobless.""Losing prestige is very hard for some people after losing their job,"" she said. ""The job was their identity, their achievement.""Rather than simply commiserate with them, Maton assigns homework. She may ask a client to research entrepreneurial opportunities or industry trends.""Giving them tasks to do takes their mind off of future concerns that they cannot control,"" she said. ""Left on their own, they might get caught up in things that they can't control. So I focus their attention on an immediate concern that they can address.""

But it's shooting the same old blanks.In upsetting House Majority Leader Eric Cantor in Virginia's GOP primary, Brat never wavered from his position that government caused the financial crisis and has stunted the recovery with more of the same bad policies. And he's not backing away from it, despite media bashing.Here's how the economics professor turned politician explained it in a post-victory interview:""The American people want to take the country back, and what motivated the race for me was after the financial circumstance, we had Fannie (Mae) and Freddie (Mac) collapse. I thought surely our political leaders, we're on our knees economically, we'll learn some lessons and get it right, and they didn't. We're still roughly in the same mess.""Brat added, ""I don't think a lot of folks in D.C. understand what free markets are, so that's the most important piece. Fannie and Freddie made two-thirds of all subprime mortgages. That is not a free-market institution. That entity ... caused the housing collapse. So we need to take free markets seriously.""Bravo. Finally, someone with eyes wide open may be joining a legislative body that for too long has had its eyes closed shut over one of the most important issues of our time.With little resistance from Republicans, Democrats and their media toadies have been able to hijack the crisis narrative and demonize private banks. The Wall Street bashing helped the Obama administration justify financial ""reform"" and centralize credit in the hands of the state.Market defenders such as Brat are a serious threat to the left's final goal of turning banks into public utilities, so it unleashed its pundits, including David Corn, who hurled brickbats about Brat repeating ""the conservative canard that Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae brought down the housing market.""Only the historical evidence is clear that the toxic twins — and their affordable-housing mission regulator, HUD — polluted the mortgage and securities industry with high-risk paper.Here are the incontrovertible facts the left continues to overlook: By 2008, government-sponsored Fannie and Freddie held $1.84 trillion in subprime and other nonprime mortgages and securities. Of the 27 million bad loans outstanding, Fannie and Freddie held almost 12 million, while the Federal Housing Administration and other federal agencies held more than 5 million, with another 2.2 million originated by lenders under federal anti-redlining mandates. Washington housing policies and regulations were responsible for more than 72% of the risky lending, while private institutions on their own accounted for 28%.While Brat would be more technically accurate arguing that more than two-thirds of the toxic loans were generated by not just Fannie and Freddie but also FHA, HUD and the Community Reinvestment Act, he is correct to lay the subprime mess chiefly at the feet of Fannie and Freddie.The mortgage giants, under pressure from HUD and its escalating affordable-housing quotas, loosened the underwriting standards and down-payment requirements followed by the entire mortgage industry. Their government-created hunger for subprime purchases spurred a frenzy of subprime originations in the private market. They also drove the private market for subprime securities on Wall Street.Sorting out blame isn't an academic debate. Because the evidence was never publicly litigated, the crisis was misdiagnosed — and the economy is taking the wrong prescriptions for preventing another.Brat understands that more government is not the answer. It's just more poison.

1399,MAC,"Apple's whisper-thin iPad Air 2 would have been a hit with Wallis Simpson, the Duchess of Windsor, who famously said, ""You can never be too rich or too thin.""The new iPad Air measures 6.1 millimeters thin, 18% thinner than the original 7.5 millimeter-thin model introduced last fall.Apple (AAPL) unveiled the iPad Air 2 tablet at a media event Thursday at its headquarters in Cupertino, Calif. It also took the wraps off the iPad Mini 3 tablet, an upgraded Mac Mini computer and an all-in-one iMac computer with 27-inch Retina 5K display.Most of the product announcements had leaked out in media reports in recent weeks, prompting Apple to do a comedy routine about ""tripling down"" on secrecy. Craig Federighi, Apple's senior vice president of software engineering, did an Internet phone call with comedian Stephen Colbert, announced as the company's new ""chief of secrecy.""""It's really great to have Stephen on board,"" Apple CEO Tim Cook said. ""I hope he can do a better job at controlling those leaks.""Apple is counting on its new iPads to reinvigorate sagging tablet sales. But analysts aren't so sure.The new iPads are probably insufficient to jump-start Apple tablet sales, UBS analyst Steven Milunovich said in a research note.""IPad volumes have gone flat (to be generous),"" he wrote. ""The iPad suffers from longer upgrade cycles than phones and being caught in the middle as phablets move up and the functional delineation vs. PCs sharpens.""Apple might have to come out with a 13-inch convertible tablet-notebook to boost sales, Milunovich said.The new iPads are ""more evolutionary than revolutionary,"" Cowen analyst Timothy Arcuri said in a note. He said he is skeptical that the new models will help stabilize iPad sales, which have fallen for two straight quarters.""Ultimately, the key for us will be the 12.9-inch tablet/notebook/2-in-1 crossover product expected to launch in first-half 2015,"" he wrote.The regular sized iPad today has a 9.7-inch screen, while the iPad Mini has a 7.9-inch display.Fingerprint ID FeatureThe iPad Air 2 and iPad Mini 3 both feature a Touch ID fingerprint sensor in the home button for security. They also boast faster processors, faster graphics and improved cameras over prior models.Apple hammered home how thin the iPad Air 2 is by showing that two of them stacked on top of each other are still thinner than the original iPad from four years ago. That first iPad was 13 millimeters thick. The Wi-Fi-only version of the iPad Air 2 weighs under a pound (437 grams), compared with 1.5 pounds (680 grams) for the first iPad.Apple has sold more than 225 million iPads since it launched the product category in April 2010.The new iPads go on sale online Friday and will begin shipping late next week in the U.S. and other countries. The iPad Air 2 starts at $499 for the Wi-Fi-only version and $629 for the model with Wi-Fi plus cellular.The iPad Mini 3 starts at $399 for Wi-Fi-only and $529 for Wi-Fi plus cellular.Apple also cut the prices of its older model tablets — the iPad Air, the iPad Mini and iPad Mini 2. The cheapest iPad is the entry level iPad Mini at $249.Apple executives wowed event attendees with the super-high-resolution display for the new 27-inch iMac. Its 5K display has four times more pixels than the standard 27-inch iMac. It has seven times more pixels than a 1080p HDTV and 67% more pixels than latest 4K televisions.The new iMac is available for order through Apple's online store and starts at $2,499.Given its price tag, the top-of-the-line iMac is likely to have a limited total addressable market, Arcuri said. But its display technology could provide an indication of what Apple might do if it launches its own television, he said.Apple also trotted out a new, lower-priced version of its compact Mac Mini computer, which comes without a display, keyboard or mouse. It starts at $499, $100 less than the previous version.In other news, Apple announced that customers can start using its new Apple Pay mobile e-wallet starting Monday at select retailers. The touch payment technology is built into the new iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, which debuted on Sept. 19.The product updates announced Thursday are important because they impact about 30% of Apple's total business, Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster said in a report. ""Although the updates weren't as exciting as those from the iPhone 6 launch, (they) were necessary to keep the iPad and Mac lines fresh,"" he said.

1420,MAC,"The U.S. budget deficit shrank to a six-year-low $486 billion in the just-ended fiscal 2014 from $680 billion in 2013, the Congressional Budget Office said Wednesday.
"

"

"
1427,MAC,"The falling budget deficit also reflects efforts to rein in discretionary outlays — military spending fell by $30 billion, or 4.9%, last year. Meanwhile, an improving job market and the end of emergency jobless benefits cut unemployment insurance spending by $24 billion, or 34%.

1428,MAC,"Yet despite sequestration's spending restrictions and continued recovery in tax revenue, budget progress is about to grind to a halt and gradually reverse.

1429,MAC,"One reason is the ramping up of spending on ObamaCare. Exchange subsidies cost the government just $13 billion with the troubled launch that occurred in the second quarter of the fiscal year. In fiscal 2015, that's projected to rise to $50 billion.

"
1486,MAC,"Overregulation: Four years ago this week, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act passed amid claims it would ""fix"" our financial system. We warned then it would be a disaster, and we were right.On July 27, 2010, as the media touted ""another huge milestone for President Obama,"" we argued that the new Dodd-Frank bill was ""2,319 pages of unintended consequences for the economy."" We were far too kind.Since then, lending has suffered as banks have pulled in their horns due to the punitive new regulations. And while the bill has generated 14,000 pages of new rules so far, the bureaucrats writing them are barely half-done, according to Davis Polk & Wardwell, a law firm that's keeping track.Instead of being our salvation, the financial reform that was supposed to fix our banking system once and for all turned into financial poison. And it's spreading.One of the promises was that ""too big to fail"" would be ended or fixed. It wasn't. Indeed, by deeming hundreds more banks ""systemically important,"" the new law made financial institutions with as little as $50 billion in assets too big to fail.""Ironically, Dodd-Frank's heightened expectations of a government commitment to remove the possibility of a future financial crisis may increase the probability that such a crisis will occur and require government support,"" former FDIC official Paul Kupiec, now with the American Enterprise Institute, testified this week.Meanwhile, nonbanks such as GE Capital, GMAC and other industrial finance companies came under the government's heavy regulatory hand for the first time ever.New agencies like the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which now controls all consumer lending, and the Financial Stability Oversight Council, a super-regulatory board with sweeping powers and no direct accountability to Congress, have become a dead hand.Rather than broadly regulating the system, Dodd-Frank micromanages it. As Reason.com's Peter Suderman notes, ""It regulates all manner of minutiae: the particulars of debit card surcharges, mortgage qualification rules, bank capital requirements, energy company finances and even disclosures on the corporate use of tungsten and other minerals from the Congo.""The Senate Finance Committee held hearings on Dodd-Frank this week. It wasn't exactly a celebration.""Dodd-Frank is adding to (the) regulatory burden for all institutions, with 5,933 pages of proposed regulations and 8,002 pages of final regulations,"" testified Dale Wilson, head of the First State Bank of San Diego in Texas.The ""tsunami of regulations"" that has hit small banks under the law is ""overwhelming,"" he said. This is typical of banks' experience. Just ask them.Analysts are touting a ""rebound"" in lending. But in fact, commercial and industrial loans — the heartbeat of the economy — are only now returning to pre-crisis levels. Some rebound.This recovery has been the worst in history due in large part to lenders' reluctance to lend. As noted here weeks ago, the economy has grown just 10% since exiting recession — well below the average 21% for all postwar recoveries.Even worse, Dodd-Frank didn't fix the real problem with our banks — the legacy of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-backed quasi-private mortgage agencies that bought over $1 trillion in subprime and other bad loans and repackaged them for sale on Wall Street. This was the actual cause of the financial crisis.""By 2008 roughly 58% of all U.S. mortgages — 32 million loans — were subprime or otherwise low quality,"" the American Enterprise Institute's Peter Wallison pointed out in the Wall Street Journal.Of those loans, 76% were on the books of the U.S. government, mostly Fannie and Freddie. Yet, despite this, Fannie and Freddie still exist — as does a government mandate that they keep backing loans for poor borrowers who can't pay them back. Nothing, in other words, has changed.Contrary to the false narrative of the left, governmental incompetence, not Wall Street greed, caused the financial meltdown. Just like ObamaCare, Dodd-Frank is a Democrat travesty that will haunt us for decades.

"
1489,MAC,"The retreat of large single-family home investors, a dearth of first-time homebuyers and shifting lending rules could down-throttle a housing recovery in markets hit hard by the foreclosure crisis.Frenetic sales activity in 2013 drove average home prices up more than 20% in Las Vegas and Sacramento, more than 18% in San Diego and nearly 15% in Phoenix, according to the CoreLogic Case-Shiller Indexes report, which covers more than 380 U.S. markets.Now, just as rising prices are luring more homes onto listing rolls, demand is slipping in some former hot spots, says Van Davis, president of brokerage operations at ZipRealty (ZIPR), an online real estate platform.After surging during the housing boom, the Las Vegas, Phoenix, Sacramento and San Diego markets — among others — all in varying degrees served as poster children of the foreclosure crisis but then staged partial comebacks.Markets In FluxHowever, in April median sales-price growth slowed year over year to an average of 8% in San Diego and 9% in Phoenix, according to ZipRealty. While appreciation in Sacramento and Las Vegas stayed quite strong — up 20% and 17%, respectively — it still represented a moderation in price growth, a trend that Davis expects to continue as supply gradually increases.""What's really missing is the first-time homebuyer,"" he said. ""They're the ones who give other homebuyers a way to move up. Investors filled that gap, but now that they have backed off, there is a hole in the market.""Large investors that have bought single-family homes to rent out include Blackstone Group's (BX) Invitation Homes, American Residential Properties (ARPI), Silver Bay Realty Trust (SBY) and American Homes 4 Rent (AMH) .Rising prices are another key culprit in once hot markets, which ""overcorrected"" amid investor demand and historically low interest rates, notes John Burns, CEO of John Burns Real Estate Consulting. Entry-level buyers today face monthly payments 30% to 40% higher than 18 months ago, he adds.""Young people thinking about buying a home are in sticker shock,"" Burns said. ""They're hesitating.""Less UrgencyA rising number of homes for sale in some locales is diverting attention from the cooling demand.The National Association of Realtors generally considers a six-month supply of homes a ""balanced"" market. Yet many metro areas are still well below that mark because they're coming off all-time inventory lows. As a result, a modest increase in the number of homes added to a for-sale block creates the appearance of a spike, Burns says. In Sacramento, 8,495 homes were listed for sale in April, up 42% from the 5,974 homes listed a year earlier, according to ZipRealty. San Diego had 6,717 homes for sale, a 38% increase over the 4,879 a year earlier. Inventory today is running about a third of what it was in 2007.But a relative lack of buyers means that homes stay on the market longer, making the supply seem to be rising faster than it is, says Michael Orr, director of the Center for Real Estate Theory and Practice at Arizona State University's W.P. Carey School of Business. That's the case in Phoenix, where demand is at its lowest since 1999, he adds.There were 25,586 homes for sale in Phoenix in April, a 55% rise from a year earlier, according to ZipRealty. But homes being listed for the first time in April, traditionally a peak home-selling month, grew by only 2% year over year.What's more, sales of single-family homes in Phoenix fell 20% in March from a year earlier to 7,062 homes, according to Orr's latest monthly housing report.""We don't have a lot of new listings coming along,"" Orr said. ""But if you have low demand, the ones that do come along start piling up.""He agrees with Davis and Burns on some of the dynamics in once hot markets. The bulk of investors have left, he says. And first-time homebuyers, who historically have accounted for about 40% of home sales, are driving only 25% of the activity as millennials display a stronger preference for renting, he adds. But Orr also sees a lack of demand among move-up buyers. The sluggish economy forced many owners to delay maintaining houses now for sale, and potential buyers don't want to pay high prices for a fixer-upper, he says. With demand down, buyers also lack a sense of urgency to sign a contract. It's especially true if they're already in a home with a low-payment mortgage, Orr adds.Regulatory RestraintsMore than one in four homeowners in Arizona's Maricopa County went through a short sale or foreclosure in the last few years, Orr says. It prevents them from obtaining a conventional loan under Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FMCC) rules for up to seven years, depending on the circumstances. But getting out of the so-called penalty box may not be enough to move those people into the market.""I don't how you would feel psychologically about homeownership after you've been through a foreclosure,"" Orr said. ""You may be put off by the whole thing.""Changes at the Federal Housing Authority are having a similar effect. One FHA program generally provides loan insurance to homebuyers who've gone through foreclosure, after a three-year wait.In January, however, the agency cut the size of single-family loans that it would guarantee as specified by the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008, which anticipated such adjustments as housing recovered. FHA loan limits fell more than $75,000 to $271,050 in Phoenix, $112,500 to $287,500 in Las Vegas, and more than $151,000 in San Diego to $546,250.The change has affected the buyer who's undergone a foreclosure and wants to move his or her family out of a rental and into a bigger home, Burns says. ""Many people used the FHA program to get back into the market,"" he said. ""That buyer has disappeared.""

1514,MAC,"Jihad In America: Terroristic tweets underscore the Islamic State's global reach. It has an army of Western passport holders, and an open southern border to cross. It's not only coming to the U.S.; it's already here.Slain journalist James Foley studied his craft in the Chicago area, earning a master's degree from the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University. For a time he was a teacher in the Cook County Jail boot camp program. He was familiar with the streets of Chicago. So, apparently, is the Islamic State that beheaded him.An anonymous tweet has an attached photo showing a message written in Arabic. The note is dated June 20 and is being held up in front of the Old Republic building on Chicago's Michigan Avenue. Dubbed the Magnificent Mile, a shopping mecca, Michigan Avenue is another symbol of what, from a radical Islamist perspective, is wrong with Western culture and civilization.The text reads: ""We are in your state, we are in your cities, we are in your streets, you are our goals anywhere."" It adds the hashtag #AmessagefromISIStoUS.Certainly Islamic State has proved adept at using social media to threaten its future targets and recruit sympathizers and members.It would be easy to dismiss this as a stunt with no real significance, except that it echoes promises that Islamic State and its sympathizers have already made, including to fly their black flag over the White House, currently occupied by another former Chicago resident, President Obama. Also attached to this tweet is a photo of the White House.""Many terror organizations refer to Chicago as Obama Town,"" according to CBS Chicago security expert Ross Rice, a former FBI agent assigned to the Windy City. Islamists remember that Osama bin Laden was killed on Obama's watch as drone strikes disrupted and decapitated their terrorist networks, he notes.In a joint bulletin issued with the FBI on Friday, the Department of Homeland Security warned local, county and state law enforcement agencies to be on the lookout for signs of activity by the IS and its sympathizers. We are reminded of the Tsarnaev brothers and Tamerlan Tsarnaev's time spent in the terrorist-infested Russian republic of Dagestan before returning to bomb the Boston Marathon last year.There is apparently is no shortage of American recruits for terrorism. American suicide bomber Moner Mohammad Abu-Salha, who grew up in Florida, returned to the U.S. undetected after receiving terrorist training in Syria. He later journeyed back to Syria, where he allegedly drove a truck packed with explosives into a crowded restaurant.There is also no shortage of Western passport holders who have joined Islamic State.""They are one plane ticket away from U.S. shores, and that's why we're concerned about it,"" Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Mich., chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said Sunday.As many as 3,000 members of IS have U.S. or European passports and could slip into America without notice, Rep. Mac Thornberry, R-Texas, vice chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, told CNN on Friday.British ambassador to the U.S. Peter Westmacott, in the aftermath of Foley's beheading, noted that the executioner seemingly had a British accent and is possibly a British citizen. Westmacott also said that roughly 500 Britons have joined Islamic State, with British authorities apprehending 60 or 70 of them who returned home with intent to do harm.Islamic State might not even need passports to enter America. In fact, as we noted earlier month when we reported that five IS-linked American Muslim converts had been arrested, they are already here.""I think there is the obvious great concern because of the condition of the border from the standpoint of it not being secure and us not knowing who is penetrating across, that individuals from ISIS or other terrorist states could be"" in the U.S., Texas Gov. Rick Perry said at an event held by the Heritage Foundation and National Review in Washington, D.C.They might even be taking in a Cubs game.

"
1537,MAC,"The stars have aligned in favor of a warm economic climate for home remodeling.An improved jobs picture, rising home values and calls for a pickup in economic growth are among the confidence boosters experts see driving bright prospects for remodeling spending this year.""The macroeconomic environment is positive for remodeling,"" said Celia Chen, a senior director covering the housing industry for Moody's Analytics.""Job growth is accelerating, and that means more households will have the means to do a remodel,"" Chen told IBD via by email. ""Mortgage rates are low, even though they have increased, and rising home values will also give more households the means to spend on remodeling.""Tight inventories of ""desirable"" homes for sale, she adds, may also cause some homeowners to decide to stay put and improve the homes they live in rather than move to another house.Coming Up With The MoneyChen expects job gains to run at an average of 250,000 per month in this year's second half compared with 200,000 per month in 2013 and the first quarter of 2014.She sees real gross domestic product growth rising to 2.6% in 2014 vs. 1.9% in 2013.Rising home values constitute a key driver of remodeling spending.So much so that Frank Blake, CEO of home improvement retail giant Home Depot (HD), cited rising home prices as a company growth booster, on a May 20 conference call.""Home price appreciation is one of the important drivers of our business, as homeowners get more comfortable that ... they'll be able to recoup that investment,"" Blake said.""That's a big tailwind for us, and we've seen continued home price appreciation even during some softening of other housing indicators.""Strong year-over-year home price growth continued in most metro areas in the first quarter, though with rises smaller than the prior quarter, according to the National Association of Realtors.The national median price for existing single-family homes was $191,600 in the 2014 first quarter, up 8.6% from a year earlier. That compares with a 10.1% rise in the median price in the fourth quarter.Median price growth moderated in April, according to a NAR report out May 22. The median existing-home price for all housing types for the month reached $201,700, a 5.2% rise from a year earlier. That was less of the increase seen in the first quarter, according to the NAR's latest data.""Current price data suggest a trend of slower growth, which bodes well for preserving favorable affordability conditions in much of the country,"" said NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun in a press release. He forecasts home prices will rise 6.4% from a year earlier this year and 4.2% in 2015.The continuing home-price rise is a ""good sign for remodeling,"" said Abbe Will, a research analyst for Harvard's Joint Center for Housing Studies. ""Homeowners just feel better about investing in their homes when the value is improving. It's hard to justify when prices are declining if it's a discretionary project like for the kitchen or bathroom.""How Homeowners DecideA survey by Piper Jaffray analyst Peter Keith released April 25 found that homeowners' remodeling decisions are influenced by home price appreciation, he told IBD. Specifically, 53% of those polled said that if their home is increasing in value it raises the likelihood they'll embark on a remodeling project.""I think it is a key driver,"" said Keith. ""It's not necessarily the rate of appreciation (that's meaningful). It's more the general confidence that homeowners have that home prices are actually increasing.""Another macro driver of remodeling is access to credit, says Chen.Mortgage rates hit new 2014 lows in a Freddie Mac (FMCC) survey this week. The 30-year fixed-rate loan averaged 4.12%, but that's up from 3.81% a year earlier. Freddie Mac forecasts the 30-year mortgage to rise and end 2014 around 4.6%.""Although conditions are generally positive, rising mortgage interest rates have made remodeling a little more expensive than last year,"" said Chen.Tapping Home EquityChen said lending remains tight but has ""loosened a little bit, at least for home equity installment loans."" At the end of 2013, about 65% of home equity installment loan originations were for households with a 700 plus credit score vs. 71% in the fourth quarter of 2012.In a survey by Keith out April 11, HELOCs made the biggest jump as a method of payment to fund sizable projects, with 14% of those polled planning to use a HELOC to finance part of large-ticket projects, up from 9% in previous surveys.""We are not ready to conclude that HELOCs will start to grow in the near future, but as home values have continued to improve and more people again have equity in their homes, it seems more likely that more homeowners will start to utilize HELOCs to fund remodeling projects in the future,"" Keith wrote. ""If this occurs it could be a nice driver to future remodeling spending.""A hefty 63% of respondents who intended to do a big-ticket project planned on using cash savings to pay for some of the costs, says Keith. Some 39% of those polled by Keith planned on using a credit card.Chen says remodel spending this year is up from last year. After accounting for inflation, investment in residential improvements rose 3% from a year earlier in the 2014 first quarter, she says, citing Bureau of Economic Analysis data.The latest Leading Indicator of Remodeling Activity, released by Harvard's Joint Center in April, shows the outlook for home remodeling spending as ""very strong,"" says Will. The LIRA shows a 9.4% increase in annual spending on home improvement in 2014 from a year earlier. That would compare with a 4% annual rise in 2013, she adds, citing Census Bureau figures.

One, by ""offering additional credit support for certain eligible mortgage loans or pools of eligible mortgage loans, such as by covering a portion of any capital required to obtain insurance from the corporation"" — that is, housing subsidies.And, two, by ""grants and loans for research, development and pilot testing of innovations in underwriting.""Such ""innovations"" in mortgage underwriting are what sank Fannie and Freddie and the entire financial system in the first place. So here we go again.The authors of this bill — Democrat Sen. Tim Johnson, who happens to be one of the top recipients of pre-crisis Fannie-Freddie campaign payola, and GOP Sen. Mike Crapo — ought to have their heads examined.But give them the benefit of the doubt. Maybe, like Nancy Pelosi, they have to pass it to find out what's in it.Perhaps they also don't know that fees collected from private mortgage securitizers will also fund another affordable-housing slush fund controlled by HUD, the agency that ran Fannie and Freddie into the ground with its escalating subprime mandates.It's called the ""Housing Trust Fund,"" and it, too, will pump subsidies into the ""underserved"" market.Tellingly, none of these slush funds is subject to oversight from Congress and could easily be diverted for political schemes. Without such oversight, we can expect more misuse of taxpayer dollars.Johnson-Crapo is a disastrous bill that doubles down on the mistakes that led to the financial crisis. Senate Republicans would be wise to abandon support for it.

Christopher Molumphy, chief investment officer, Franklin Templeton Fixed Income Group®, and Roger Bayston, senior vice president, Franklin Templeton Fixed Income Group®, offer their perspective on the markets year-to-date, and why they believe investors shouldn't become too complacent about a zero-interest rate environment in the US, particularly if economic growth, employment and inflation accelerate.

1617,MAC,"The Fed recently released its updated economic projections, which offer us some insight into how policymakers view the overall economic backdrop. In June, the Fed forecast roughly 3% economic growth for the rest of this year and 3.0 — 3.2% for 2015.1 This is roughly in line with the broad market consensus, but it is worth pointing out that it is greater than the pace of economic growth we've seen over the past five years, which averaged roughly 2%.2 The Fed continues to see a gradual improvement in the rate of unemployment, forecasting roughly 6% at year end; this improvement trend is expected to continue, falling to 5.4 — 5.7% by year-end 2015. In addition, the Fed also released its expectation for a long-run or full-employment rate, putting the jobless rate in the neighborhood of 5.2 —5.5%, which it currently forecast should be reached in 2016.3 
"
1618,MAC,"Turning to inflation, Federal Reserve officials focus on Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) over the Consumer Price Index (CPI) in their projections, and are looking at PCE inflation of roughly 1.5 - 1.7% in the fourth quarter of this year and staying at 1.5 - 2% through 2016.4 Interestingly, we just received an update on PCE data through May, and it is already running roughly within this range. So, the Fed's projections effectively show no increase in the pace of inflation over the next two and a half years. Our view is that if you think about fairly strong US economic growth in the neighborhood of 3%, combined with a gradual continued improvement in the employment figures, the expectation for inflation to stay at current levels may be somewhat optimistic - at least given historical context. The Fed also announced that it would continue to reduce its asset purchase program known as quantitative easing or ""QE"" to $35 billion a month in July and that if the economy progresses as it expects, it will end its monthly asset purchases in October. 
"
1619,MAC,"More importantly is the question of when the Fed will finally increase the federal funds rate from close to or at zero, and then how quickly it will be raised going forward. The Fed has reiterated its two objectives are centered on inflation and unemployment. 
"
1620,MAC,"In terms of when the QE program will end and the beginning of interest rate increases will begin, the Fed has repeated the phrase ""considerable time.""

According to minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting of June 17-18, the median forecast of FOMC members for the benchmark federal funds rate was 1.13% by the end of 2015 and projected to reach 2.5% by the end of 2016. The general market consensus seems to be in agreement with those projections.

1625,MAC,"The investment-grade sectors of the US fixed-income market, which include investment-grade corporate bonds and agency mortgage-backed securities, have benefited from the trend of lower interest rates since the beginning of the year. 
"
1626,MAC,"The Fed is tapering its purchases in the mortgage-backed securities markets and, if the US economy continues to strengthen in line with the Fed's expectations, is expected to be done in October if the current pace continues. It should be noted the agency mortgage-backed securities market will at that time be operating in an environment of no explicit or implicit support by US government agencies for the first time in a very long time. 
"
1627,MAC,"Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac historically have provided massive support by purchasing mortgage bonds into their portfolios; after the global financial crisis hit, the Fed assumed that role through their quantitative easing (""QE"") programs. We believe the Federal Reserve should continue to reinvest principal for mortgage bond prepayments and maturities into the agency mortgage pass-through market. So, it should still have a market presence going forward even as QE winds down. The Fed's portfolio of mortgage bonds is quite large—over $1.5 trillion in assets—but policymakers claim they will not be liquidating these investments anytime soon. I would tend to believe them. The Fed's goal for buying the assets in the first place was to help reduce long-term rates and provide a favorable backdrop for mortgage financings. So to sell the assets and contribute to possibly pushing long-term rates higher, including mortgage rates, would defeat that purpose in the near term. 
"
1628,MAC,"At this point, the outlook for the agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) market is a bit mixed, in our view. Conversely, there is less support from the Fed through the reduction of its buying program. Normally this would be met with a bit more volatility in the market as the marketplace seeks to absorb MBS issuance once the Fed completes its QE3 operations; however, with the large amount of global liquidity that is moving around the world now muting market volatilities and still encouraging a level of risk-taking, the agency mortgage market has been performing well. I guess it's always a good reminder that these particular markets are not generally exposed to default risk as either their implicit or explicit backing of the US government remain at a place where investors continue to be insulated from corporate credit risk. The deeper we move along the credit cycle, the more important that attribute possibly will become for fixed-income investors. 
"
1629,MAC,"The agency MBS sector includes Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Ginnie Mae has the explicit full faith and credit backing of the US government. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are under conservatorship, so while their backing remains implicit it has moved closer to an explicit guarantee. At some point there will likely be reform to existing US housing finance that could change the current structure of these guarantees, but until that time the market expects government support for these sectors to remain. Prepayment risk on agency mortgage securities remains quite low and this has pushed the durations or interest rate sensitivity of the sector to high levels. We expect prepayment risk to remain low unless and until the 10-year Treasury yield drops below 2%, which would also push down mortgage rates and open up refinancing opportunities for mortgages issued during the past five years. 
"
1630,MAC,"The other credit-sensitive sectors of the mortgage markets, including non-agency residential mortgage markets and the commercial mortgage-backed securities markets, have performed pretty well since the start of the year. The theme here is the same: low market volatility and continuously improving fundamentals in the underlying residential and commercial real estate markets. Despite their generally good performance, issuance in these markets is way down from the levels prior to the financial crisis. There seems to be healthy demand from investors. 
"
1631,MAC,"The biggest question we get is really: Now that we've had years of low short-term rates and solid performance in the fixed-income markets, what's next for investors? From a multi-sector viewpoint, we continue to like the fundamentals within several credit-related fixed-income markets. Diversified and defensive remain themes that we are focused on at the moment.

So, it should still have a market presence going forward even as QE winds down. The Fed's portfolio of mortgage bonds is quite large—over $1.5 trillion in assets—but policymakers claim they will not be liquidating these investments anytime soon. I would tend to believe them. The Fed's goal for buying the assets in the first place was to help reduce long-term rates and provide a favorable backdrop for mortgage financings. So to sell the assets and contribute to possibly pushing long-term rates higher, including mortgage rates, would defeat that purpose in the near term. At this point, the outlook for the agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) market is a bit mixed, in our view. Conversely, there is less support from the Fed through the reduction of its buying program. Normally this would be met with a bit more volatility in the market as the marketplace seeks to absorb MBS issuance once the Fed completes its QE3 operations; however, with the large amount of global liquidity that is moving around the world now muting market volatilities and still encouraging a level of risk-taking, the agency mortgage market has been performing well. I guess it's always a good reminder that these particular markets are not generally exposed to default risk as either their implicit or explicit backing of the US government remain at a place where investors continue to be insulated from corporate credit risk. The deeper we move along the credit cycle, the more important that attribute possibly will become for fixed-income investors. The agency MBS sector includes Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Ginnie Mae has the explicit full faith and credit backing of the US government. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are under conservatorship, so while their backing remains implicit it has moved closer to an explicit guarantee. At some point there will likely be reform to existing US housing finance that could change the current structure of these guarantees, but until that time the market expects government support for these sectors to remain. Prepayment risk on agency mortgage securities remains quite low and this has pushed the durations or interest rate sensitivity of the sector to high levels. We expect prepayment risk to remain low unless and until the 10-year Treasury yield drops below 2%, which would also push down mortgage rates and open up refinancing opportunities for mortgages issued during the past five years. The other credit-sensitive sectors of the mortgage markets, including non-agency residential mortgage markets and the commercial mortgage-backed securities markets, have performed pretty well since the start of the year. The theme here is the same: low market volatility and continuously improving fundamentals in the underlying residential and commercial real estate markets. Despite their generally good performance, issuance in these markets is way down from the levels prior to the financial crisis. There seems to be healthy demand from investors. The biggest question we get is really: Now that we've had years of low short-term rates and solid performance in the fixed-income markets, what's next for investors? From a multi-sector viewpoint, we continue to like the fundamentals within several credit-related fixed-income markets. Diversified and defensive remain themes that we are focused on at the moment.

1667,MAC,"Social Engineering: It's official: Americans have lost their housing gains since '95, when Bill Clinton launched his homeownership crusade. His lending rules artificially created demand and a housing bubble that's still deflating.A new Census Bureau report shows the share of Americans who own their homes in the first quarter was 64.8%, down from 65.2% in the previous three months and the lowest since the second quarter of 1995, when it was 64.7%.It was then that Clinton announced his national drive to expand mortgage lending for first-time homebuyers with low income and shaky credit.Through a series of regulations and policies that remained in place in the run-up to the housing crisis, he pushed private lenders to underwrite loans for people who couldn't normally afford a home. At the same time, he ordered Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac — whom he called major partners in his crusade — to buy, bundle, securitize and guarantee them.His aggressive campaign turned what had been fringe lending for high-risk borrowers into a mainstream, lucrative market. In fact, Clinton created the subprime mortgage and securities markets on Wall Street, something he and his aides bragged about at the time.As government data show the subprime souffle that Clinton created collapsing, his library is making public documents that memorialize his National Homeownership Strategy.""We have effectively stopped the slide in homeownership that plagued America in the 1980s and early 1990s,"" Clinton said in a 1996 speech. ""We are on course to meet the goal we set when we announced our homeownership strategy . . . a national homeownership rate of 67.5% — the highest in our country's history.""He hit that mark in early 2001. Three years later homeownership set a record of 69%.But that was the height of the Clinton subprime souffle. It's been all downhill from there.Sadly, his affordable-housing policies have backfired on the very groups they were designed to help most.Above all, Clinton hoped to close the homeownership gap between whites and blacks. After he pressured banks and Fannie and Freddie to ease lending rules, black ownership rates shot up to record levels.The media at the time attributed the growth to the ""first real enforcement of the Community Reinvestment Act,"" an anti-discrimination law regulating mortgage lending. Harvard found that, thanks in large part to such policies, minorities accounted for nearly half the growth in homeownership from 1995 to 2005.Only, as home prices cratered, minority ownership rates proved unsustainable. Today, the gap with whites is just as wide as it was two decades ago.Millions have lost their homes. Widespread foreclosures have drained some $350 billion in wealth from communities of color. While the nation endured a recession, these areas have suffered a depression.In the end, Clinton's housing policies did no one any favors. He turned the American Dream into a nightmare for many minorities and devastated the housing sector.""Our homeownership strategy will not cost the taxpayers one extra cent,"" Clinton promised during a White House ceremony attended by Acorn officials.This was perhaps Slick Willie's most pernicious lie.Because his housing program was subsidized by the private bankers he drafted, he was technically correct. But when his policies eventually brought down Fannie and Freddie and Wall Street with them, taxpayers ended up footing a massive bailout.Today, Clinton faults President Bush, Republicans, ""greedy"" Wall Street bankers and everybody but himself for the housing debacle.But he has only his own half-baked policies to blame.

1712,MAC,"2014: New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo may come to regret smearing his GOP challenger as a racist for fighting HUD activism. In doing so, he's opened up his own record at HUD to debate, and it's a doozy.Slipping in the polls, the liberal Democrat and former HUD secretary last week ran a pair of nasty attack ads that smacked of desperation. In one, he charged that presumptive GOP gubernatorial nominee Rob Astorino ""violated anti-discrimination law"" as Westchester County executive.Cuomo claimed Astorino ""refused to stop discrimination"" in the Manhattan suburbs and has a ""die-hard resistance to civil rights."" ""He's so far right,"" the ad wraps, ""he's wrong for New York.""In fact, Astorino has taken a courageous stand against the Obama Housing and Urban Development's national campaign to seize control of zoning regulations from municipalities across the country.Westchester is one of several counties that HUD is suing or investigating for discrimination. Its anti-zoning crusade will soon be codified in a regulation with the Orwellian-sounding title ""Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing.""When that monstrous overreach goes into effect, Astorino will look like a hero for pushing back against what can only be described as an out-of-control agency.Last week, Astorino said his county would forfeit $5 million in federal grants rather than comply with HUD's 2009 order to gut local zoning ordinances it deems discriminatory.Westchester, you see, is ""violating anti-discrimination law"" only as interpreted by Obama's race baiters, who have yet to prove their charges.Astorino, who is bilingual and endorsed by local NAACP leaders, challenged Cuomo to a debate to back up his ""unforgivable accusation."" He says the governor is ""rooting for his old D.C. buddies"" over his own county (Cuomo lives in northern Westchester).Even the New York Times suggests Cuomo should man up and debate Astorino. That would be worth watching. Cuomo is sticking his chin out on HUD and housing policy. Astorino ought to slug him with the facts about his ""affirmative-action lending"" crusade at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac that ended up devastating the minority community he deigns to defend.According to the book ""The Great American Bank Robbery,"" Cuomo in 2000 argued that Fannie's and Freddie's ""expanded presence in the subprime market could be of significant benefit to lower-income families, minorities and families living in underserved areas.""So he directed them to ""play a significant role in the subprime market"" while meeting stringent new affordable-housing quotas.Two years later, a HUD report found that ""Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are expanding their subprime business, partially in response to the higher affordable housing goals established by HUD.""In 2004, moreover, HUD reported that Fannie and Freddie were ""increasing their business in the subprime market,"" and it attributed their greater exposure to those risky loans to Cuomo's 2000 policy.""In the 2000 GSE Rule,"" the agency said, ""HUD identified subprime borrowers as a market that can assist Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in reaching their higher affordable housing goals.""Despite media whitewashing, history makes clear that Cuomo plunged Fannie and Freddie into dangerous subprime lending while insisting that they ease what he described as their ""rigid"" credit requirements.HUD's own documents show that he prodded them to dominate the subprime market, arguing they would find their ""goals qualifying"" mortgages there. He also authorized them to buy subprime securities to earn credits against his drastic affordable housing goals.Just before leaving office in 2001, Cuomo claimed his policies would ""help reduce the huge homeownership gap dividing whites from minorities and suburbs from cities."" But the high-risk subprime loans he pushed defaulted, and the resulting foreclosures have left millions of minorities without homes.Cuomo is a chief reason blacks have lost hundreds of billions in wealth. So whose minority housing record is racist?

1768,MAC,"Kimco Realty Corp. (KIM  -  Free Report) has provided an update of its Q2 transaction activity and reported that it has sold 17 shopping centers, aggregating 2.7 million square feet of space, in the quarter. With these dispositions, the company’s second-quarter sales volume has surpassed $330 million and for the first half of the year, the same aggregated $556 million. This retail REIT now remains on track to meet its full-year disposition target of $700-$900 million.Specifically, the 17 shopping centers were sold off for $334.0 million, of which Kimco’s share of dispositions amounted to $319.3 million. The bunch of properties that were sold off included a 368,000-square-foot property in Springfield, MO — Primrose Marketplace — that was sold for $51.8 million, a 356,000-square-foot property in Chula Vista, CA — Broadway Plaza — for $58.5 million as well as a 269,000-square-foot center in Downers Grove, IL — Downers Park Plaza — for $26.7 million. The company also disposed a 145,000- square-foot property in Hoover, AL — The Grove — for $21.0 million which marked its exit from the state of Alabama.The company witnessed solid demand for open-air shopping centers and the Q2 property sales’ blended cap rate came in line with its expected range of 7.5-8%.Notably, mall traffic continues to suffer from the rapid shift in customers' shopping preference through online channels, resulting in store closures and retailers bankruptcies. These have cast a pall on retail REITs like Simon Property Group Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report), GGP Inc. (GGP  -  Free Report), Kimco Realty, Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report) and others, and their share prices have suffered in the past 12 months.However, Kimco has been countering the challenges and the company is on track with its 2020 Vision that envisages the ownership of high-quality assets, concentrated in major metro markets which offer several growth levers. Particularly, the company is aimed at improving its portfolio mix and experiencing decent demand from high-growth category retailers, including off-price and home improvement.In fact, amid transformation in the retail landscape, Kimco remains well poised to navigate through mall traffic blues, with focus on service and experiential tenants, and omni-channel players who generate 56% and 39% of annual base rent, respectively. Moreover, the company is aiming to expand its small shops portfolio. These shops basically comprise service-based industries, such as restaurants, salons and spas, personal fitness and medical practices. The shops enjoy frequent customer traffic and are Internet resistant. Amid limited new supply and favorable demographics, this diversification is likely to help Kimco limit its operating and leasing risks.However, in connection to its strategic efforts, Kimco is making significant disposition of the company’s assets.

1769,MAC,"The Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report) enjoys a premium portfolio and the presence of well-capitalized tenants in its roster. Additionally, the company’s increasing adoption of the omni-channel model in retailing is anticipated to enhance shopping experience and bolster sales volume at the tenant stores, thereby raising demand for Macerich’s properties.Notably, Macerich has a high concentration of premium malls in some vibrant U.S. markets. The company has been diversifying its traditional tenant base by including several emerging digital and store-based retailers for offering enhanced shopping experience at the company’s retail centers.Additionally, Macerich has been focusing on an aggressive capital-recycling program, involving divestiture of non-core and slower-growth assets, and usage of the proceeds in higher-growth properties through acquisitions, developments, and redevelopment initiatives. As part of such measures, since 2013, Macerich sold 21 non-core retail centers for an aggregate of $1.8 billion in proceeds.Moreover, the company remains on track with its redevelopment pipeline and pre-leasing deals.  Further, Macerich is aiming to enhance its assets quality as well as customer relationships. Going forward, we expect such moves to offer an upside potential to the company and strengthen its high-end portfolio.Nevertheless, with e-retail taking precedence, retail real estate investment trusts (REIT) continue to suffer as mall traffic has taken a beating. In fact, with e-commerce gaining market share from the brick-and-mortar stores, retailers are compelled to reconsider their footprint and eventually opt for store closures, while others unable to cope with competition have been filing for bankruptcies.This dreary environment has also resulted in tenants demanding substantial lease concessions, which, however, mall landlords find unjustified. As such, retail REITs like Macerich, GGP Inc. (GGP  -  Free Report), Kimco Realty Corp. (KIM  -  Free Report), Simon Property Group (SPG  -  Free Report) and others have been affected, and the companies’ share prices have been suffering for the past 12 months.Further hike in interest rate can also pose a challenge for the company. Essentially, rising rates imply higher borrowing cost for the company, which would affect its ability to purchase or develop real estate and lower dividend payouts as well. Moreover, the dividend payout itself might become less attractive compared to the yields on fixed income and money market accounts.Amid such retail woes, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have underperformed the industry it belongs to in the past three months.

1770,MAC,"DDR Corp. (DDR  -  Free Report) recently completed the previously-announced spin-off of a portfolio of 48 properties into a new public company — Retail Value Inc. (“RVI”).RVI will now begin regular-way trading on the NYSE under the ticker symbol of RVI. Its portfolio consists of 36 continental U.S. assets and DDR’s entire Puerto Rico portfolio of 12 assets. Per the press release of RVI, the company has a gross book value of nearly $2.8 billion as of Mar 31, 2018.  DDR shareholders, holding 10 common shares of DDR at the close of business on Jun 26, received one RVI common share. However, since fractional shares of RVI were not distributed, DDR common shareholders will receive cash in lieu of any such fractional shares that would be entitled to receive from the distribution.RVI will be managed by DDR executives to capitalize on maximum cost efficiencies. Further, the company will be managed to dispose its properties. Nonetheless, the newly-formed company will have a separate board of directors.   The spin-off will transform DDR’s portfolio and offer significant re-leasing opportunities that will accelerate net operating income (NOI) growth. The company’s trimmed portfolio will no longer have exposure to Puerto Rico. This will enable DDR to maintain scale of operations and focus on core assets in the United States.Per DDR management, the spin-off of RVI will benefit shareholders who can realize higher value through RVI’s operations and disposition. Also, redevelopment, same-store NOI growth and higher investment opportunities will provide additional value for shareholders.Notably, the split-up is seen as a business strategy to create two companies with distinct strategies. DDR now owns 210 properties exhibiting top-tier demographics, and offering maximum scope for growth and redevelopment. On the other hand, Retail Value is expected to liquidate its entire portfolio within two to three years in order to realize the private market values for the company’s properties which are currently discounted by public markets.Such significant measures by the company demonstrate its priority to enhance portfolio mix and are accretive for long-term growth as well. However, the predominance of e-retailers over brick-and-mortar sales is a serious concern for this retail REIT. In fact, a number of retail landlords, including The Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report), Kimco Realty Corporation (KIM  -  Free Report) and Taubman Centers (TCO  -  Free Report), have been affected due to online retail channels increasingly gaining popularity. This has also resulted in widespread store closures and bankruptcy filing by the retailers.DDR currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1771,MAC,"Simon Property Group Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report) has a diversified exposure to retail assets in the United States and abroad. Further, the company’s efforts to support omni-channel retailing, portfolio-restructuring initiatives and healthy balance sheet augur well for long-term growth.However, as Simon Property is trying to counter the choppy retail real estate environment through various initiatives, these require upfront costs and thus, it is likely to limit any robust growth in the company's profit margins in the near term. Also, stiff competition from online sales and rise in interest rate pose challenges for the company.Notably, Simon Property has been active in restructuring its portfolio, and is aimed at premium acquisitions and transformative redevelopments. In fact, at the end of the first quarter, it had redevelopment and expansion projects, including the addition of new anchors, in progress at 28 properties across the United States, Canada and Asia.In May, Simon Property launched a $4+ billion of investment plan to transform its properties aimed at creating value and drive footfall at the company's properties. The transformational plans included addition of hotels, restaurants and luxury stores.Also, later in May, Simon Property announced the continuation of its plan to recapture former Sears locations across its portfolio, transforming those into retail, fitness, dining and entertainment hubs.In fact, earlier in April, Simon Property announced the company’s transformational redevelopment plans for the former Sears stores, at five major locations. The properties included in the refurbishment plan were Brea Mall (Brea, CA), Burlington Mall (Burlington, MA), Midland Park Mall (Midland, TX), Ocean County Mall (Toms River, NJ) and Ross Park Mall (Pittsburgh, PA). Enhancements to the properties included entertainment, fitness, restaurants and dining pavilions, residential, as well as new retail brands.The company has also resorted to micro-retail modeling that offers store units ranging from 20-200 square feet of space. With such a huge pipeline, the company is well poised to effectively leverage the improving spending habits of wealthier customers amid improving economy.Such initiatives are expected to draw more traffic at the company’s properties.In addition, Simon Property boasts a strong and improving balance sheet. At the end of first-quarter 2018, the company had more than $7.0 billion of liquidity. This comprised cash on hand, including its share of joint-venture cash, and available capacity under the company’s revolving credit facilities.Furthermore, solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticement for REIT shareholders and Simon Property remains committed to that. The company has steadily raised its dividend, over the past years, increasing from $3.50 in 2011 to the present annualized rate of $7.80 per share.Nevertheless, with e-retail taking precedence, retail REITs continue to suffer as mall traffic has taken a beating. In fact, with e-commerce gaining market share from the brick-and-mortar stores, retailers are compelled to reconsider their footprint and eventually opt for store closures, while others unable to cope with competition have been filing bankruptcies.This tepid environment has also resulted in tenants demanding substantial lease concessions, which, however, mall landlords find unjustified. As such, retail REITs like Simon Property, GGP Inc. (GGP  -  Free Report), Kimco Realty Corp. (KIM  -  Free Report), Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report) and others have felt the heat, and the companies’ share prices have been suffering for the past 12 months.Further, though Simon Property is putting in every effort to enhance the value of its assets, implementation of such measures requires a decent upfront cost. This would, therefore, limit any robust growth in its near-term profit margins.Rise in interest rate remains another concern as this might restrict the company’s ability to refinance existing debt and increase the interest cost on new debt. This, in turn, is feared to negatively impact the company’s financial results and dividend payout.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have outperformed the industry it belongs to in the past three months.

1772,MAC,"Retail REIT Regency Centers Corporation (REG  -  Free Report) recently revised its outlook for 2017 and provided the preliminary guidance for 2018. Moreover, the company reported its fourth-quarter 2017 acquisitions and dispositions.Specifically, the company projects core funds from operations (FFO) per share for 2017 in the band of $3.68-$3.70, backed by same-property net operating income (NOI) growth, excluding termination fees, of +/- 3.6% on a pro-rata basis. The company had earlier estimated core FFO per share in the range of $3.66-$3.70 on 3.2-4.0% growth in same-property NOI. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is $3.69.Moreover, the preliminary guidance for 2018 includes core FFO per share projection of $3.76-$3.83, on same-property NOI growth, excluding termination fees, of 2.25-3.25% on a pro-rata basis. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $3.83. The company has also introduced an operating FFO per share outlook in the band of $3.48-$3.54 for the year. Notably, the company is considering operating FFO to measure earnings growth because the purchase accounting adjustments required with the Equity One merger would have an uneven impact on earnings.Regarding investment activity, Regency Centers stated that it closed acquisitions worth around $150 million during fourth-quarter 2017. This included the 132,000-square foot neighborhood shopping center — Scripps Ranch Marketplace (San Diego, CA) — for $81.6 million. This property is anchored by Vons. The other asset is 150,000-square foot infill retail center — Roosevelt Square (Seattle, WA) — anchored by Whole Foods Market which was purchased for $68.3 million.On the other hand, the company reaped approximately $103 million of gross proceeds from the sale of five shopping centers during the quarter. Further, it commenced the development of two projects, with Regency’s share of net estimated development costs aggregating $39 million. This included Wegmans anchored 174,000-square foot shopping center — Midtown East — in Raleigh, NC, and Publix Greenwise anchored 51,000-square foot shopping center Indigo Square in Charleston, SC.In addition, Regency received around $89.1 million of net proceeds following the final settlement of its forward sale agreement that took place on Dec 14, 2017, through delivery of 1,250,000 shares of the company’s common stock.Notably, at a time when shrinking footfall at malls amid rise in online channels, store closures and bankruptcy of retailers have emerged as a pressing concerns for most retail REITs, including Simon Property Group, Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report), GGP Inc. (GGP  -  Free Report) and Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report), Regency is focused on building a premium portfolio of grocery-anchored shopping centers. Such centers are usually necessity driven and steer a dependable traffic.The company has considerable experience in the retail real estate industry and has developed several real estate projects over the years. However, recent efforts of e-retailers to expand in the grocery business have emerged as a concern.

1773,MAC,"Regency Centers Corporation (REG  -  Free Report) announced that it has purchased Scripps Ranch Marketplace — a shopping center — in San Diego. This acquisition is anticipated to fortify the company’s presence in the San Diego market.This purchase underpins Regency’s focus on grocery-anchored assets in thriving sub markets. The property, spanning 132,000 square feet of space, is anchored by supermarket chain Vons, CVS, Starbucks as well as other regional operators.The shopping center is located within Scripps Ranch — an affluent master planned community in San Diego — which demonstrates impressive demographics and solid daytime population. Further, the property’s proximity to Interstate 15, off Scripps Poway Parkway, that experiences heavy traffic, makes it easily accessible.    In addition, this property is a long-term asset for the company and will likely witness high footfall as it is situated in a vibrant and growing retail corridor. Management aims to enhance this center and its merchandising mix to upgrade the community destination.The above-mentioned acquisition also complements Regency’s two existing centers in the locality — 4S Commons Town Center and Twin Peaks Plaza in Poway. In fact, it expands the company’s presence in the San Diego market with more than two million square feet of community-serving retail space. Some other notable Regency shopping centers in San Diego include Costa Verde Center, Balboa Mesa Shopping Center, Friars Mission Center and The HUB Hillcrest Market.   Amid the challenging retail environment, Regency is focused on building a premium portfolio of grocery-anchored shopping centers through tenant-driven acquisitions. Such centers are usually necessity driven and attract dependable traffic. Hence this strategy is appropriate for Regency’s growth.Particularly, of late, mall traffic has been adversely affected due to the rapid shift in consumers’ shopping preferences toward online channels. With a number of retailers joining the dot-com bandwagon or reconsidering their footprint and opting for store closures, retail landlords, including The Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report), Taubman Centers (TCO  -  Free Report) and Kimco Realty Corporation (KIM  -  Free Report), have been facing challenging times.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have underperformed the industry over the past year.

1774,MAC,"DDR Corp. (DDR  -  Free Report) recently experienced a rating downgrade by Moody's Investors Service. Specifically, the rating of its senior unsecured debt has been downgraded by a notch to Baa3 from Baa2. However, the rating outlook has been revised from negative to stable.The downgrade comes after DDR’s decision to spin-off a portfolio of 50 sellable assets into a separate public-traded real estate investment trust (REIT) — Retail Value Trust (“RVT”). (Read more: DDR to Spin-Off Sellable Properties Into a New Company)While this portfolio repositioning strategy eliminates the company’s exposure to Puerto Rico and other U.S. properties with low growth potential, it leaves DDR with a less sustainable portfolio as compared to other shopping center REITs.   Per the rating agency, DDR’s remaining portfolio will be more prone to leasing pressure and tenant bankruptcies. Further, its portfolio might face challenges in markets where the company does not have a sturdy presence.In addition, retail landlords, including DDR, The Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report), Kimco Realty Corporation (KIM  -  Free Report) and Taubman Centers (TCO  -  Free Report), have been witnessing decline in store sales as e-commerce continues to transform the retail landscape. This has resulted in a number of store closures and bankruptcy filing by retailers. The rating agency predicted that this choppy retail environment will impact DDR’s leasing and occupancy in the upcoming 12-18 months. Also, the company might increase rent concessions and relax co-tenancy clauses in a bid to improve occupancy. This is expected to mar DDR’s operating performance, per Moody’s.  Per the rating agency, the downgrade also reflects DDR’s unclear long-term growth strategy.    The revised rating outlook reflects volatility in operating results stemming from retail headwinds. However, it also acknowledges DDR’s efforts to maintain a conservative capital structure supported by decent net debt/ EBITDA ratios. In fact, the Baa3 senior unsecured rating also reflects fixed charge coverage in the mid 2x band. The company also has solid liquidity with a well-laddered debt profile. DDR has a $1-billion unsecured revolver and a large pool of unencumbered assets. Moody’s expects that these factors will reduce operating volatility for the next two years.Rating upgrades and downgrades are important for investors because these indicate a company’s creditworthiness in the market. Such movements denote the company’s accessibility to capital and determine borrowing costs on debts. Notably, the downgrade will affect DDR’s securities worth $3.3 billion.DDR currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Shares of the company have underperformed its industry year to date.

1775,MAC,"Mall traffic continues to suffer from the rapid shift in customers' shopping preference through online channels. In fact, with e-commerce gaining market share from brick-and-mortar stores, retailers are compelled to reconsider their footprint and eventually opt for store closures in recent years, while others unable to cope with competition have been filing bankruptcies. Such an environment has also led to tenants demanding substantial lease concessions which mall landlords find unjustified.These have cast a pall on retail REITs like Simon Property Group Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report), GGP Inc. (GGP  -  Free Report), Kimco Realty Corp. (KIM  -  Free Report), Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report) and others, and their share prices have suffered in the past 12 months.However, not all are equally likely to fall behind. In fact, Kimco is making every effort to unlock the embedded value of its portfolio through development and re-development initiatives. Most recently, the company has achieved more than 75% of preleasing for its $108-million Mill Station Signature Series development project. The shopping center is being constructed on the site of the previous Owings Mills Mall in Baltimore County, MD.The company is on track with its 2020 Vision that envisages the ownership of high-quality assets, concentrated in major metro markets which offer several growth levers. Particularly, the company is aimed at improving its portfolio mix and experiencing decent demand from high-growth category retailers, including off-price and home improvement.In fact, amid transformation in the retail landscape, Kimco remains well poised to navigate through mall traffic blues, with focus on service and experiential tenants and omni-channel players who generate 56% and 39% of annual base rent, respectively. Moreover, the company is aiming to expand its small shops’ portfolio. These shops basically comprise service-based industries, such as restaurants, salons and spas, personal fitness and medical practices. The shops enjoy frequent customer traffic and are Internet resistant. Amid limited new supply and favorable demographics, this diversification is likely to help Kimco limit its operating and leasing risks.Further, Kimco is engaged in the execution of strategic measures to boost its capital structure, and enhance the company’s growth profile and tax efficiency as well. The company maintains a strong liquidity profile, with $2.25-billion unsecured line of credit, and aims at growing its unencumbered asset pool which consists of 75% of its properties.However, in connection to its strategic efforts, the company is making significant disposition of its assets. The company disposed 21 shopping centers for $219.5 million in the first quarter, with its share of the sales price being $210.2 million. Furthermore, the company expects to be a net seller of properties in 2018 and projects its pro-rata share of dispositions, net of any acquisitions, to be in the range of $700-$900 million. While such efforts are encouraging for the long term, the dilutive effect on earnings from high disposition activity cannot be averted in the near term.Addition, hike in rate of interest is expected to affect the REIT’s rate-sensitive business. It would restrict the company’s ability to refinance existing debt while increasing the interest cost on new debt. This has the power to adversely impact the company’s financial results and its dividend payout as well. In addition, amid rising interest rates, the common stock buyers demand a higher dividend yield and this may negatively impact the market price of the common stock.Kimco currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1776,MAC,"Retail REIT Macerich (MAC  -  Free Report) recently joined forces with privately-held comprehensive health and lifestyle company and brand — Life Time — for changing consumer experience at Biltmore Fashion Park in Phoenix, with an athletic lifestyle resort destination. This Biltmore Fashion Park is Arizona's luxury retail destination which already houses reputed retailers and restaurants.Specifically, a ground-up, 80,000 square-foot resort destination will be opened at this upscale shopping center in the east surface parking lot. It will mark the first Diamond-level location for Life Time in Arizona and the company’s sixth club in the state.The high-end destination will offer LifeSpa — a full-service salon and spa and LifeCafe — a full-service, fast casual restaurant and bar. It will also have a rooftop pool with bistro, group fitness studios, yoga studios, a Pilates studio, and a basketball court in addition to several other amenities.These ventures with Life Time come at a point when mall traffic has been shrinking due to a change in shopping patterns, with online shopping taking precedence over in-store purchase. As a result, demand for retail real estate space has been diminishing of late, as the changing patterns are compelling retailers to reconsider their footprint, and eventually opt for store closures or file bankruptcies.Amid this, mall landlords have decided to go to the mattresses. They are avoiding heavy dependence on apparels and accessories, and transforming their shopping hubs into swanky entertainment zones. The mall landlords are expanding dining options, opening up movie theaters, offering recreational facilities and transforming the former anchor spaces to create complete, resort-like healthy living and entertainment destinations.Ultimately, the aim is to transform retail shopping centers in such a way that they appear as one-stop destinations, where people can not only shop, live and work, but also entertain, socialize and exercise and even visit their doctor or relax at the spa. These measures are likely to help increase traffic and drive sales.Shares of Macerich have underperformed the industry it belongs to, in the year so far.

1777,MAC,"The Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report) announced that it has sold its wholly owned office property at 500 North Michigan Avenue in Chicago for $86.4 million.  This transaction is in line with the company’s efforts to reposition and improve its portfolio quality on the back of strategic acquisitions and sale of non-core assets.The 500 North Michigan Avenue property offers 326,000 square feet of office space and was unencumbered. It is located adjacent to The Shops — a shopping center owned by Macerich. The four-level shopping center, spread across 673,000 square feet of space, is anchored by Eataly and Nordstrom. With 99.2% occupancy level as of Sep 30, 2017, Macerich enjoys high demand for retail space in the assets. Further, the area boasts strong trade demographics which help generate high sales per square foot of $906.The sale is consistent with Macerich’s aggressive capital-recycling program, which involves the divestiture of non-core and slower-growth assets, and using the proceeds in higher-growth properties through acquisitions, developments and redevelopment initiatives. Specifically, the company aims at rotating capital out of its non-strategic assets and reinvesting in high-quality retail properties in key retail destinations across the nation.  In fact, per the latest earnings call, the company continued to shrink its non-core portfolio and shed interest in a Philadelphia-based office building for $31 million. Macerich recorded a gain of $6.7 million from this transaction. Additionally, the proceeds from these dispositions were used for share buybacks.Going forward, we expect such moves to offer an upside potential to the company and strengthen its high-end portfolio which consist of ownership in 54 million square feet gross leasable area, in mainly 48 regional shopping centers.However, year to date, amid the choppy retail real estate environment, shares of Macerich have underperformed the industry it belongs to.

Recently, the company announced the continuation of its plan to recapture former Sears locations across its portfolio, transforming those into retail, fitness, dining and entertainment hubs, and thereby drawing more traffic at these shopping destinations.In fact, earlier in April, Simon Property announced the company’s transformational redevelopment plans for the former Sears stores, at five major locations. The properties included in the refurbishment plan were Brea Mall (Brea, CA), Burlington Mall (Burlington, MA), Midland Park Mall (Midland, TX), Ocean County Mall (Toms River, NJ) and Ross Park Mall (Pittsburgh, PA). Enhancements to the properties included entertainment, fitness, restaurants and dining pavilions, residential, as well as new retail brands.Admittedly, a rapid shift in customers' shopping preferences to online channels has jeopardized the traffic flow in malls. In fact, with e-commerce grabbing market share from brick-and-mortar stores, retailers are compelled to reconsider their footprint and eventually opt for store closures, while others unable to cope with competition have been filing bankruptcies.Amid these, tenants are also demanding substantial lease concessions, which, however, mall landlords find unjustified. Such an environment has cast a pall over retail REITs like Simon Property, GGP Inc. (GGP  -  Free Report), Kimco Realty Corp. (KIM  -  Free Report), Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report), and others, and the companies’ share prices have been suffering for the past 12 months.However, Simon Property is making every possible move to counter this challenging situation. The company is making heavy investments not only to elevate the value of its retail properties, but also for exploring mixed-use development option which has gained immense popularity in recent years.Such developments lower the distance between housing, workplaces, retail businesses, and other amenities and destinations. Hence, such developments enable companies to grab the attention of people who prefer to live, work and play in the same area — a trend that drove development in several other cities in the United States.Nevertheless, the implementation of such measures requires a decent upfront cost and therefore, would limit any robust growth in its near-term profit margins.

1779,MAC,"Following a Bloomberg report that outlined a potential buyout of GGP Inc. (GGP  -  Free Report), shares of the retail real estate investment trust (REIT) ascended more than 16% to $22.10 on Tuesday. Per the report that cited a person familiar with the matter, asset manager Brookfield Asset Management Inc. has held preliminary talks with GGP Inc. to increase its ownership stake in the shopping mall investor and take the company private. Both companies have discussed a possible premium of around 10-15% above GGP Inc.’s share price as of the start of the week.Although the takeover deliberations are in the nascent stage, there is a possibility that the pricing may change or the deal might be called off.Currently, Brookfield owns 35% stake in the U.S. domiciled company. Brookfield first acquired interest in GGP Inc. to back the company during its troubling bankruptcy times in 2010. In January 2013, it acquired additional GGP warrants and agreed to limit ownership in the company to 45% for four years. In third-quarter 2017, Brookfield’s real estate unit exercised the outstanding GGP warrants, purchasing 68 million shares for a total consideration of $462 million.The agreement that restricted the asset manager to increase its stake above the threshold limit expired in January 2017. Hence now, the company has complete flexibility to increase its ownership in GGP Inc. and bid for a takeover. Interestingly, a report had earlier surfaced in January 2016, according to which Brookfield was considering taking the retail REIT private. Notably, GGP Inc. has a portfolio of high-quality retail properties across prospective locations in the United States and a well capitalized tenant roster as well.Following the buyout news, other mall REITs like Simon Property Group (SPG  -  Free Report), The Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report) and Taubman Centers, Inc. (TCO  -  Free Report) rejoiced as these companies’ shares also traded higher on the news.Shares of Simon climbed 2.6% to $159.1 during regular trading session on Nov 7, while shares of Macerichwere up 8.43% to $58.76. Taubman stock also rallied4.97% to $48.6 during yesterday’s trading session. The U.S. retail real estate market has been plagued with issues like downsizing and bankruptcies of retailers in recent times. This is because mall traffic has been shrinking considerably amid rapid shift in consumers’ shopping patterns, with e-retail taking center stage. This has emerged as a key concern for retail REITs, like GGP, as the trend is curtailing demand for the retail real estate space significantly, and limiting landlords’ pricing power and occupancy level of properties.Shares of GGP Inc. have underperformed the industry it belongs to, year to date. The company’s shares have lost 11.1% as against the industry’s growth of 6.8% during the period. Further, GGP Inc. currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1782,MAC,"Pennsylvania Real Estate Investment Trust (PEI  -  Free Report) — better known as PREIT — is making every possible move to strengthen its balance sheet. The company recently announced execution of a recast of $700-million revolving credit and term loan facility.The accomplishment of these transactions prior to their scheduled maturities offers flexibility to the company because although the terms and conditions remain the same as its existing loans, their maturities now get extended to 2023.This makes the company’s maturity schedule well-laddered and the company now has no material debt maturities until 2021. Thus, the company has accomplished more than $1 billion in transactions in the financing market, in the year so far.Specifically, the facilities included $400-million unsecured revolver and two $150-million 5-year term loans. For the $400-million revolver, the interest rate is unchanged at LIBOR plus a range of 120-155 basis points (bps), based on a calculation of Liabilities to Gross Asset Value (GAV). Notably, the rate is 130 bps over LIBOR on the basis of the company’s current leverage. Considering term, this facility now has 4 years plus 1 year extension option (maturity in 2023).For the $300-million term loan, interest rate is unchanged at LIBOR plus a range of 135-190 bps. The rate is 160 bps over LIBOR based on the company’s current leverage. The loan’s term is five years, with maturity in 2023.  Admittedly, shrinking mall traffic and store closures amid aggressive growth in online sales have kept retail REITs, including PREIT and others like Simon Property Group, Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report), The Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report) and GGP Inc. (GGP  -  Free Report), on tenterhooks. Furthermore, tenants are demanding substantial lease concessions owing to a turbulent retail real estate market scenario. Nonetheless, retail REITs are countering this dreary situation and putting in every effort to enhance the malls’ productivity, by focusing to grab attention from new and productive tenants, and disposing the non-productive ones, on the other hand.PREIT, too, along with its remerchandising, redevelopment and anchor-repositioning program, has resorted to a portfolio rejig, selling lower productivity malls, as well as other non-core properties over the past several years. The company also recently announced scope for densification including addition of 5,000-7,000 residential units in the Philadelphia and Washington DC markets, and 1,500-3,000 hotel units across its several properties.While such measures are a strategic fit for the long term, these efforts tend to drag down margins in the near term. Therefore, amid the choppy retail real estate environment, this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company underperformed the real estate market in the past three months. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Shares of PREIT have ascended 3% as compared with the real estate market’s rally of 5.5%.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

The building, previously occupied by Macy's, Inc. (M  -  Free Report), is currently under construction. The developers have planned a grand opening for Round1, which is scheduled to occur prior to the holiday season of 2018.Notably, the growing popularity of Round1 is expected to increase the mall traffic and attract visitors from other regions too.

It offers bowling, an arcade, karaoke, billiards, food and drinks under one roof.Stephen Lebovitz, president & CEO of CBL Properties informed, “CBL has made excellent progress on its redevelopment program over the last several months, with demand from many exciting retailers, entertainment users, and restaurant operators. We are thrilled to move forward with this phase of redevelopment and welcome this world-class entertainment operator to Jefferson Mall.”Of late, mall traffic has been adversely affected due to the rapid shift in consumers’ shopping preferences toward online channels. With a number of retailers jumping on the dot-com bandwagon and reconsidering their footprints and opting for store closures, retail landlords, including CBL Properties, The Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report) and Kimco Realty Corporation (KIM  -  Free Report), have been facing challenging times.However, retail real estate investment trust’s (REIT) are fighting back and avoiding heavy dependence on apparel and accessories.

1791,MAC,"Retail REITs are not in the pink of health, as mall traffic continues to suffer due to the rapid shift in customers' shopping preferences, with e-retail taking precedence. In fact, with e-commerce gaining market share from the brick-and-mortar stores, retailers are compelled to reconsider their footprint and eventually opt for store closures, while others unable to cope with competition have been filing bankruptcies.This environment has also resulted in tenants demanding substantial lease concessions, which, however, mall landlords find unjustified. As such, retail REITs like Simon Property Group Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report), GGP Inc. (GGP  -  Free Report), Kimco Realty Corp. (KIM  -  Free Report), Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report) and others have felt the heat, and the companies’ share prices have been suffering for the past 12 months.However, not all are equally likely to fall behind. In fact, among those, reputed retail REIT — Simon Property Group — has been making concerted efforts focused on overhauling its properties, aiming premium acquisitions and transformative redevelopments, and increasingly adopting omni-channel strategies. These will help the company counter the retail blues and make its shopping malls more alluring.In April, Simon Property announced the company’s transformational redevelopment plans for the former Sears stores, at five major locations. This move will help the retail REIT draw more traffic to these malls in order to benefit the existing retailers.The properties included in the refurbishment plan are Brea Mall (Brea, CA), Burlington Mall (Burlington, MA), Midland Park Mall (Midland, TX), Ocean County Mall (Toms River, NJ), and Ross Park Mall (Pittsburgh, PA). Enhancements to the properties include entertainment, fitness, restaurants and dining pavilions, residential, hotel and office, as well as new retail brands.  In fact, over the past five years, this retail REIT invested more than $5 billion in development projects, and further intends to invest substantially for development and redevelopment projects. Such initiatives are expected to draw more traffic at the company’s properties.Moreover, at the end of first-quarter 2018, Simon Property had redevelopment and expansion projects, including the addition of new anchors, in progress at 28 properties across the United States, Canada and Asia. The company has also resorted to micro-retail modeling that offers store units ranging from 20-200 square feet of space. With such a huge pipeline, the company is poised to effectively leverage the improving spending habits of wealthier customers amid improving economy.Also, total portfolio net operating income growth for first-quarter 2018 came in at 4.8%. This reflected increase in operating income from comparable properties, as well as additions from new development, redevelopment, expansion and acquisitions. As such, the company managed to surpass expectations in the first quarter and also raised its outlook for 2018.In addition, Simon Property boasts a strong and improving balance sheet. At the end of first-quarter 2018, the company had more than $7.0 billion of liquidity. This comprised cash on hand, including its share of joint-venture cash, and available capacity under the company’s revolving credit facilities.Furthermore, solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticement for REIT shareholders and Simon Property remains committed to that. The company has steadily raised its dividend over the past years, increasing from $3.50 in 2011 to the present annualized rate of $7.80 per share.Nevertheless, though Simon Property is putting in every effort to enhance the value of its assets, implementation of such measures requires a decent upfront cost. This would, therefore, limit any robust growth in its near-term profit margins.Additionally, rise in interest rate remains another concern as this might restrict the company’s ability to refinance existing debt and increase the interest cost on new debt. This might impact the company’s financial results and dividend payout.Simon Property has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The stock has gained 3.8% in a month’s time, while the industry rallied 2.4%. Also, the stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 funds from operations (FFO) per share being revised marginally upward in a month’s time.

1792,MAC,"Realty Income Corporation’s (O  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 adjusted funds from operations (FFO) per share of 79 cents came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate and increased 3.9% from the prior-year quarter.The company benefited from revenue growth in the quarter and also attained its highest quarter-end occupancy in more than 10 years. Further, the company reiterated its guidance for 2018 adjusted FFO per share.Total revenues for the reported quarter came in at $318.3 million, up 6.8% year over year. However, the reported figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $321.6 million.Quarter in DetailDuring first-quarter 2018, same-store rents on 4,747 properties under lease expanded 1.0% to $276.7 million from the prior-year quarter. Portfolio occupancy of 98.6% as of Mar 31, 2018, expanded 20 basis points (bps) sequentially and 30 bps year over year.Further, the company had 75 properties available for lease, out of a total of 5,326 properties in the portfolio as of Mar 31, 2018, compared with 83 properties as of Dec 31, 2017. Moreover, during the reported quarter, it re-leased 55 properties to existing and new tenants, at a rent recapture rate of 100.4%.Portfolio ActivityThe company made solid property acquisitions in the quarter that are leased to mainly investment grade rated tenants. During the reported quarter, Realty Income invested $509.8 million in 174 new properties and properties under development or expansion, situated in 27 states. The assets are fully leased, with a weighted average lease term of around 14 years, and an initial average cash lease yield of 6.2%. Around 85% of the rental revenues from acquisitions reported during the quarter came in from investment grade-rated tenants.On the other hand, during the quarter, the company sold 14 properties for $13.8 million, with a gain on sales of $3.2 million.LiquidityFinally, Realty Income exited first-quarter 2018 with cash and cash equivalents of $20.6 million, down from $6.9 million at the end of 2017.However, the company has a $2.25-billion unsecured credit facility, comprising $2.0 billion revolving credit facility and a $250-million five-year unsecured term loan. The credit facility also bears a $1.0-billion expansion feature. As of Mar 31, 2018, Realty Income had borrowing capacity of $918 million available on its revolving credit facility.Moreover, the borrowing capacity of the revolving credit facility improved to $1.4 billion, subsequent to the use of proceeds from the April notes offering to payback borrowings under the revolving credit facility.Furthermore, Realty Income raised $2.3 million from the sale of common stock at a weighted average price of $51.08 per share during the first quarter.OutlookFor full-year 2018, Realty Income reiterated its adjusted FFO per share of $3.14-$3.20. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at $3.16.Our TakeRealty Income’s high occupancy of its properties in the first quarter looks impressive. Notably, dwindling mall traffic amid shift of consumers toward online channels, store closures and bankruptcy of retailers have emerged as pressing concerns for most retail REITs, including Kimco Realty Corp. (KIM  -  Free Report), GGP Inc. (GGP  -  Free Report) and Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report). However, not all firms are affected, as a few companies are gaining even in this dismal scenario, backed by the robust business models.In fact, this freestanding retail REIT — Realty Income — derives more than 90% of its annualized retail rental revenues from tenants belonging to service, non-discretionary and low-price retail business. Such businesses are less susceptible to economic recessions and competition from Internet retailing. Furthermore, the company’s solid underlying real estate quality and prudent underwriting at acquisitions have helped maintain its high occupancy levels consistently. Additionally, its same-store rent growth displayed limited operational volatility. Also, the company adheres to a conservative capital structure.Nevertheless, substantial exposure to single-tenant assets increases risks associated with tenant default. In addition, generation of notable rental revenues from assets leased to drug stores and rate hikes are other key concerns.Realty Income currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1793,MAC,"Retail REIT The Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report) delivered first-quarter 2018 funds from operations (FFO) per share of 82 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a cent.Results were backed by robust growth in re-leasing spreads and tenant sales growth. However, the company recorded lower portfolio occupancy.The company posted revenues of $212 million for the first quarter, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $215 million. Further, the figure came in 3.5% lower than the prior-year quarter figure.Quarter in DetailAs of Mar 31, 2018, mall portfolio occupancy shrunk 30 basis points (bps) year over year to 94%. Mall tenant annual sales increased 7.4% year over year to $686 per square feet. Re-leasing spreads for the year ended Mar 31, 2018, increased 14.7%. Average rent per square foot ascended 3.8% to $58.44 from $56.31 as of Mar 31, 2017.Also, same-center net operating income for the reported quarter inched up 0.07% from the prior-year period.As of Mar 31, 2018, Macerich’s cash and cash equivalents summed $118.2 million, up from $91 million reported as of Dec 31, 2017.GuidanceMacerich reaffirmed its guidance for 2018. The retail REIT expects FFO per share of $3.92-$4.02. This is backed by the same-center NOI growth rate projection of 2-2.5%, and no asset sales or acquisitions assumptions. Currently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for full-year FFO per share is pegged at $3.95.Our ViewpointThe company has resorted to non-core asset dispositions and recycling the proceeds toward higher quality assets. It continued with this strategy in the Jan-Mar quarter as well. Such moves are expected to improve Macerich’s portfolio quality.   However, it is feared that dwindling footfall amid shift of consumers toward online channels, store closures and bankruptcy of retailers might affect the company’s near-term performance. While Macerich has been striving to counter the pressure through efforts to support omni-channel retailing and bringing online retailers to its stores, implementation of such measures requires a decent upfront cost. Therefore, this might consequently limit any robust growth in profit margins in the near future.Macerich Company (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Macerich Company (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Macerich Company (The) QuoteCurrently, Macerich has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1794,MAC,"We are in the heart of the Q1 reporting cycle and the real estate investment trust (REIT) space is bustling with activity as there is a deluge of Q1 earnings releases lined up for this week, including Essex Property Trust, Inc. (ESS  -  Free Report), Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. (MAA  -  Free Report), The Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report), Federal Realty Investment Trust (FRT  -  Free Report), Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. (HST  -  Free Report) and Equinix, Inc. (EQIX  -  Free Report). These companies are slated to release their quarterly numbers on May 2.Per our latest Earnings Preview, total Finance Sector earnings, of which REITs are a part, for the Jan-Mar quarter are expected to increase 27% based on 4.7% increase in revenues, as compared with the prior-year quarter.Particularly, with underlying asset categories and the location of properties playing a vital role in determining REITs’ performance, not all the companies in this space are equally poised to excel or fall behind, this season.Let’s have a close look at the factors that will impact the above-mentioned REITs’ first-quarter results.Mid-America Apartment Communities — commonly known as MAA — maintains a well-balanced portfolio in the Southeast and the Southwest regions of the United States. Further, favorable demographics and strong job growth in target markets are anticipated to drive demand for MAA’s properties. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter total revenues is currently pegged at $385 million, denoting projected growth of 1.6% year over year.Notably, per the latest report from the real estate technology and analytics firm — RealPage, Inc. (RP  -  Free Report) — the national apartment market remained moderated in first-quarter 2018. Annual rent growth slipped to 2.3% in Q1 which marked moderation from the 2.6-2.9% growth rate experienced throughout 2017. Occupancy level of 94.5% in March edged down from the prior-year tally of 95%. Nevertheless, the overall occupancy level is still healthy and the first quarter usually marks a slow leasing period, thanks to the cold weather that inhibits shift of householdsFurther, there is an increasing apartment supply in a number of markets of MAA. This high supply is likely to put pressure on rental rates in the to-be-reported quarter. In addition, there is high-concession activity amid elevated supply, which remains a concern.The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $1.46, which indicates no movement on a year-over-year basis. (Read more: Mid-America Apartment Q1 Earnings: What's in Store?)Our proven model does not conclusively show that MAA is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here, as you will see below.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Although the company has an Earnings ESP of +0.78%, an unfavorable Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) makes it difficult for our proven model to conclusively predict a likely earnings beat this season.However, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, which is depicted in the graph below:Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues is pegged at $223.8 million, indicating a year-over-year improvement of 7.9%. However, with store closures and retailer’s bankruptcy filing the retail real estate remains choppy. Amid this, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of percentage rents of $3.02 million reflect a 16.6% decline compared with the prior quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Q1 FFO per share is $1.50 which indicates a year-over-year rise of 3.5%.

We anticipate the company to have enjoyed a stable source of rent in the to-be-reported quarter from its tenants that include several well-capitalized retailers.Although the company is resorting to different strategies, mall traffic continues to remain considerably depressed with consumers increasingly opting for online purchases. This has led to rising number of retailers joining the dot-com bandwagon. In fact, the first few months of the year witnessed several preeminent retail bankruptcy filings and record-high defaults by retail corporates.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first-quarter minimum rental revenues is currently pegged at $142 million. This indicates a sequential decline of 6%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for percentage rents of $1.7 million reflects a 10% dip from the prior-year quarter.Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues is pegged at $214.8 million, indicating a year-over-year fall of 13.1%.

This is due to tough comparisons, resulting from inauguration and Women's March in D.C. last year as well as the Easter weekend, beginning on Mar 30 this year.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues is pegged at $1.32 billion, indicating an expected decline of 1.9% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Room Revenues is pegged at $824 million, down from $847 million reported in the prior quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of FFO per share for the first quarter is 41 cents.

Growing debt burden will affect the company’s profitability in the quarter under review as interest expenses would flare up.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share of $4.94 for the first quarter witnessed a rise of 19.3% from the prior-year quarter.

1795,MAC,"Simon Property Group, Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report) announced that it will expand the Happy Returns services available at its malls to several other locations. This will enable an increasing number of customers to return purchases made online at malls where Simon Guest Services is available.Notably, Happy Returns already has a significant presence in Simon’s malls. The recent agreement will see the company expanding in additional 16 centers owned by Simon Property.Using the Happy Returns platform, shoppers will be able to return online purchases made from select retailers to the Simon Guest Services desk, with an immediate credit. Hence, customers can effectively skip the lengthy return process of packing and shipping items. Moreover, refunds can be made faster.While customers can experience an easy return process, it also provides them an opportunity to find what they need at Simon Property’s retail centers.  Notably, this transaction is Simon Property’s trump card — there is a high tendency of shoppers making returns to make additional purchases from malls — thereby boosting mall footfall.Notably, with e-retail becoming the latest favorite shopping channel, traffic flow in malls has taken a backseat. In fact, with e-commerce grabbing market share from brick-and-mortar stores, retailers are now forced to reconsider their footprint and opt for store closures, while those unable to match up with competition are filing bankruptcies. Amid these, tenants are also demanding substantial lease concessions, which, however, mall landlords find unjustified. This turbulent environment has cast a pall over retail REITs like Simon Property, The Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report), Taubman Centers (TCO  -  Free Report) and Kimco Realty Corporation (KIM  -  Free Report) among others.Nonetheless, Simon Property is making every possible move to bridge the gap between Internet retail, and the brick and mortar stores. The company is undertaking strategic measures to help online retailers fortify their physical presence. And the well-planned expansion of the Happy Returns services to other locations will enable online brands, with insignificant physical presence, to better serve customers.In addition to the above, the company recently announced that comfort-focused lifestyle brand — Tommy John — will expand its retail footprint by opening a store at the SouthPark shopping mall in Charlotte, NC. The physical store development will be helped by Simon Property through its New Business Team which assists online brands to transition from 'Clicks to Bricks.’ (Read more: Simon's SouthPark Mall Picked for Tommy John's Next Store)Currently, Simon Property has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1796,MAC,"DDR Corp (DDR  -  Free Report) has been putting in strategic efforts to revamp its portfolio through an aggressive capital-recycling program. Further, the company has made progress with the spin-off of Retail Value Inc. (RVI), as it recently announced the distribution dates for the same. This spin-off is expected to streamline the company’s portfolio. Moreover, DDR is now shifting its focus from deleveraging to redevelopment strategy aimed at retenanting and densification of the company’s properties.Nevertheless, this involves large scale dispositions which are anticipated to impact the company’s bottom-line performance in the near term. In addition, the choppy retail real estate environment with store closures and bankruptcies, and shift in customers’ shopping preferences toward online purchases remains a concern for this retail real estate investment trust (REIT). Rate hike adds to its woes.Notably, DDR has been trying to streamline its organizational structure, which is likely to drive the company’s long-term growth. The restructuring is aimed at raising efficiencies, achieving appropriate staffing level, centralizing key operational decision making and bringing down operating costs. This will enable the company to reduce general and administration expenses by $6 million, annually.Additionally, DDR has been following an aggressive capital-recycling program through strategic asset management, which is aimed at reducing currency and development risks, as well as aiding expansion in premium U.S. markets. Consequently, the company is divesting its non-prime and non-income producing assets, and using the proceeds for reinvestment in premium U.S. shopping centers. It has nearly completed the existing $900-million disposition program. Such initiatives are likely to pave way for top-line growth, as well as demographic improvement in the long term.Also, the deleveraging process has helped the company improve its liquidity profile and expand DDR’s unencumbered asset pool. It also helped extend the weighted average maturities of the company’s debt. In fact, its pro forma average debt maturity is 6.3 years, at present. Further, with less than 10% of total debt outstanding maturing prior to 2022, DDR remains well poised to maximize on growth scopes.In first-quarter 2018, DDR sold assets worth $365.9 million, with the company’s share being $208.7 million. Dispositions for 2017 totaled approximately $1.3 billion. While dispositions are a strategic fit for long-term growth, the near-term dilution effect of such moves is unavoidable. In fact, the company witnessed a year-over-year decline of funds from operations (FFO), primarily due to the dilutive impact of asset sales. Nonetheless, management anticipates this dilution to end in 2018.Furthermore, with e-retail taking precedence, retail REITs continue to suffer as mall traffic has taken a beating. In fact, with e-commerce gaining market share from the brick-and-mortar stores, retailers are compelled to reconsider their footprint and eventually opt for store closures, while others unable to cope with competition have been filing bankruptcies.This dreary environment has also resulted in tenants demanding substantial lease concessions, which, however, mall landlords find unjustified. As such, retail REITs like DDR, GGP Inc. (GGP  -  Free Report), Kimco Realty Corp. (KIM  -  Free Report), Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report) and others have been affected, and the companies’ share prices have been suffering for the past 12 months.Rise in interest rate remains another concern as this might restrict the company’s ability to refinance existing debt and increase the interest cost on new debt. This, in turn, is feared to negatively impact the company’s financial results and dividend payout.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have outperformed the industry it belongs to in the past three months. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.DDR has gained 28.4%, while the industry has rallied 7.1%.

1797,MAC,"Ushering in good news for its shareholders, Realty Income Corporation (O  -  Free Report) recently announced its 97th dividend hike since the company’s NYSE listing in 1994. The company will now pay 22 cents per share compared with the 21.95 cents paid earlier.Realty Income will pay the dividend on Jul 13 to shareholders on record as of Jul 2, 2018. The latest dividend rate marks an annualized amount of $2.64 per share versus the prior rate of $2.634 per share. Based on the company’s share price of $52.85 on Jun 19, this results in a dividend yield of around 5%, which is marginally ahead of the industry’s yield of 4.94%. This is likely to draw investors’ attention to the stock, to some extent.Admittedly, solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticement for REIT investors and Realty Income remains committed to boosting shareholders’ wealth. The company enjoys a trademark on the phrase “The Monthly Dividend Company” and the July 2018 dividend payment will mark its 83 consecutive quarterly increases, as well as payment of more than $5.5 billion throughout the company’s 49-year operating history. In fact, this retail REIT has generated a compound average annual dividend growth of around 4.7% since its listing on the NYSE. Given its financial position and lower debt-to-equity ratio compared to the industry, the latest dividend rate is likely to be sustainable.Notably, dwindling mall traffic, amid shift of consumers toward online channels, store closures and bankruptcy of retailers have emerged as pressing concerns for most retail REITs, including Kimco Realty Corp. (KIM  -  Free Report), GGP Inc. (GGP  -  Free Report) and Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report). However, Realty Income has been able to differentiate itself by deriving 90% of its annualized retail rental revenues from tenants belonging to service, non-discretionary and low-price retail business. Such businesses are less susceptible to economic recessions and competition from Internet retailing.The company’s solid underlying real estate quality and prudent underwriting at acquisitions has helped maintain high occupancy levels consistently. In fact, since 1996, the company’s occupancy level has never been below 96%. Moreover, in first-quarter 2018, it attained the highest quarter-end occupancy in more than 10 years. Additionally, its same-store rent growth underlines limited operational volatility.Moreover, Realty Income adheres to a conservative capital structure. It has modest leverage, robust liquidity, and continued access to attractively priced equity and debt capital. In addition, it has a well-laddered debt maturity schedule.Nonetheless, the company’s substantial exposure to single-tenant assets raises risks associated with tenant default. Further, generation of notable rental revenues from assets leased to drug stores and rate hike add to its woes.Shares of Realty Income have outperformed the industry it belongs to, in the past three months. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has gained 5.9%, while the industry reported growth of 5.5% during the same time frame.

1798,MAC,"The Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report) — a retail real estate investment trust (REIT) — is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 2, after the market closes. Its funds from operations (FFO) per share and revenues are anticipated to decline year over year.In the last reported quarter, the company posted FFO per share of $1.13, lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.8%. Results underscored a contraction in portfolio occupancy and total revenues.Over the trailing four quarters, Macerich beat estimates in two occasions for as many misses, resulting in an average beat of 1.2%. This is depicted in the chart below:Macerich Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise  Macerich Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Macerich Company (The) QuoteFactors That Might Influence Q1 ResultsMacerich has a secure portfolio of premium malls in vibrant U.S. markets. We anticipate the company to have enjoyed stable source of rent in the to-be-reported quarter from its tenants that include several well-capitalized retailers.Additionally, Macerich’s omni-channel distribution model, steadily rising demand and aggressive capital-recycling program amid modest supply are expected to have been conducive to the company’s Jan-Mar quarter performance.Amid prevalent challenges in the retail real estate sector, during the quarter, Macerich formed a joint venture with Hudson Pacific Properties to transform the iconic mall — The Westside Pavilion  — into an office space.Although the company is resorting to different strategies, mall traffic continues to remain considerably depressed with consumers increasingly opting for online purchases. This has led to a rising number of retailers joining the dot-com bandwagon. In fact, the first few months of the year witnessed several preeminent retail bankruptcy filings and record-high defaults by retail corporates.Subsequently, the company’s minimum rental revenues are expected to have registered a fall from the prior-year quarter. The company realizes minimum rents on a straight-line basis. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first-quarter minimum rental revenues is currently pegged at $142 million. This indicates a sequential decline of 6%.  Percentage rents, realized when tenants' specified sales targets have been met, is also anticipated to witness significant year-over-year drop due to the tepid retail environment. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.7 million reflects a 10% dip from the prior-year quarter.  Prior to the first-quarter earnings release, there is lack of any solid catalyst for raising optimism about the company’s business activities and prospects. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share in the soon-to-be-reported quarter was revised 2.4% downward to 81 cents, over the past week. Further, this indicates a decline of 6.9% year over year.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues is pegged at $214.8 million, indicating a year-over-year fall of 13.1%.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Macerich will likely beat estimates this season.

1799,MAC,"Regency Centers Corporation (REG  -  Free Report) recently announced the acquisition of two adjacent properties in Long Island, NY. The off-market buyout helps the company boost its portfolio with a property that enjoys an experienced tenant roster.The acquired properties — 33,000-square foot center anchored by Petco (Hewlett I) and the 20,000-square foot center anchored by Duane Reade (Hewlett II) — were separately operated. However, Regency’s acquisition will make these properties operational as a single center known as Hewlett Crossing.Advantageously located on the major retail corridor, Hewlett Crossing has premier demographics. In fact, around 70% of the tenants have been occupying space at the center for 15 years or above. Moreover, since 1955, the Hewlett Fish Market has been a tenant. Notably, the dense and wealthy population base helped the property experience such a seasoned tenant roster and raises our hopes for the continuation of robust footfall at this property over the long term.With this buyout, Regency fortified its presence in the Long Island to 14 centers, aggregating around 1.9 million-square feet of space.Over the past several quarters, a number of issues have cropped up in the retail REIT market, with consumers preferring online platforms over in-store purchases, resulting in store closures and bankruptcies. These have affected the share price of several major retail REITs, including The Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report), Taubman Centers (TCO  -  Free Report) and Kimco Realty Corporation (KIM  -  Free Report).Amid these, Regency’s focus on flourishing properties with highly productive grocers, restaurants, service providers, and best-in-class retailers seems a strategic fit.

1801,MAC,"Simon Property Group Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report) recently announced the company’s substantial redevelopment program at five properties. This move will help the retail REIT transform the former Sears stores and draw more traffic to these malls to benefit the existing retailers.The properties included in the refurbishment plan are Brea Mall (Brea, CA), Burlington Mall (Burlington, MA), Midland Park Mall (Midland, TX), Ocean County Mall (Toms River, NJ), and Ross Park Mall (Pittsburgh, PA).Per the plan, Brea Mall will have additional mixed uses. This comprises a new three-story, 120,000-square-foot Life Time Athletic healthy living, healthy aging, healthy entertainment destination, residential, entertainment, restaurants and new retail brands. In the Burlington Mall, the spaces will be revamped into new shops and restaurants, while in Ross Park Mall, the refurbishment plan includes a new dining hall, new retailers, restaurants, entertainment on three levels.Further, the Ocean County Mall plan comprises inclusion of new stores and transformation into dining and fitness spaces. At the Midland Park Mall, renovations include additions of two new restaurants and a new bigger Dillard's store, along with a new-to-the-market large format retailer, per the company’s press release.Notably, for the past few years, mall traffic has been plagued with challenges thanks to the shift in shopping patterns, with e-retail taking precedence, keeping retail REITs on tenterhooks. This has shrunk demand for retail real estate space, as changing shopping patterns are compelling retailers to reconsider their footprint, and eventually opt for store closures or file bankruptcies.This has been a prevailing concern for retail REITs like Simon Property, GGP Inc.

1802,MAC,"GGP Inc. (GGP  -  Free Report) enjoys a portfolio of high-quality retail properties across attractive locations in the United States. Further, its tenant roster includes a number of reputed names. GGP also focuses on omni-channel retailing and other initiatives which are encouraging. Nevertheless, declining traffic at malls, store closures and bankruptcies have emerged as a pressing concern for GGP as the trend is curtailing demand for the retail real estate space.Though the company is making efforts to counter the pressure through various initiatives, the implementation of such measures requires a decent upfront cost and will likely limit any robust growth in profit margins in the near term.In February, the retail REIT, GGP reported fourth-quarter 2017 funds from operations (FFO) per share of 48 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a cent. The figure was also higher than the prior-year quarter tally of 43 cents. Results indicated growth in same-store net operating income of 1.3% from the prior-year period.Notably, retailers are continuously evolving and in order to maximize revenues, they are using brick-and-mortar presence and internet together. Amid this, GGP is focusing on omni-channel retailing as it generates higher sales. Since early 2011, the company invested around $2.86 billion, improving its centers.  It is providing tenants with access to retail, dining and entertainment hubs in some of the best trade areas in the United States.Such moves are strategic fits as they boost the shopping experience and enhance sales volume at tenant stores, consequently raising demand for the company’s assets. Furthermore, GGP has been making efforts to add residential units to its retail centers in order to densify its retail centers. Such developments lower the distance between housing and retail destinations while steering a dependable traffic.Recently, as per a Reuters report, asset manager, Brookfield Property Partners made a revised acquisition offer to GGP. Per people familiar with the matter, the revised offer boasts of an elevated cash component. Notably, in November 2017, Brookfield offered $14.8 billion or $23 per share in a cash-and-stock offer to acquire the remaining 66% stake in GGP. However, GGP’s special board committee rejected the offer. The negotiations between the companies are ongoing and the exact value of the new offer is not known. The special board committee has yet to accept the offer.However, the U.S. retail real estate market has been plagued with issues like downsizing and bankruptcies of retailers in recent times. This is because mall traffic continues to suffer amid a rapid shift in customers’ shopping preferences and patterns with online purchases growing by leaps and bounds.This has emerged as a pressing concern for retail REITs including Simon Property Group, Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report), The Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report), Federal Realty Investment Trust (FRT  -  Free Report), GGP and others as the trend is curtailing demand for the retail real estate space considerably and curbing the landlord’s pricing power and occupancy level of properties.

1803,MAC,"For the past few years, mall traffic has been plagued with challenges thanks to the shift in shopping patterns, with e-retail taking precedence, keeping retail REITs on tenterhooks. This has shrunk demand for retail real estate space, as changing shopping patterns are compelling retailers to reconsider their footprint, and eventually opt for store closures or file bankruptcies.This has been a prevailing concern for retail REITs like Simon Property Group Inc.

However among those, reputed retail REIT — Simon Property Group — has been making concerted efforts focused on overhauling its properties and increasingly adopting omni-channel strategies. These will help the company to counter the retail blues and make its shopping malls more alluring.In line with this, the company has re-launched its brand and marketing programs. Moreover, with the omni-channel strategy gaining popularity among retailers, Simon Property is initiating programs and events, as well as entering into several partnerships for upgrading services and amenities provided to its consumers. In fact, over the last five years, this retail REIT invested more than $5 billion in development projects, and further intends to invest around $1 billion annually through 2018 for development and redevelopment projects.   Simon Property has been active in restructuring its portfolio, and is aimed at premium acquisitions and transformative redevelopments. In fact, at the end of fourth–quarter 2017, the company had redevelopment and expansion projects, including the addition of new anchors, in progress at 25 properties across the United States, Canada and Asia. With such a huge pipeline, it is well poised to effectively leverage the improving spending habits of wealthier customers amid a strengthening economy.In addition, Simon Property boasts a strong and improving balance sheet. At the end of the last reported quarter, the company had around $8.0 billion of liquidity. Also, this February, Simon Property announced amendment and extension of its 3.5-billion unsecured multi-currency revolving credit facility. The newly refinanced credit facility, when combined with the existing $4.0-billion revolver, offers the company $7.5 billion of total revolving credit capacity.Furthermore, solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticement for REIT shareholders and Simon Property remains committed to that. Concurrent with the fourth-quarter earnings release, the company announced a quarterly dividend of $1.95 per share, denoting an increase of 5.4% sequentially and 11.4% year over year. It has steadily raised its dividend over the past years, increasing from $3.50 in 2011 to the current annualized rate of $7.80 per share.Nevertheless, though Simon Property is putting in every effort to enhance the value of its assets, implementation of such measures requires a decent upfront cost. This would, therefore, limit any robust growth in its near-term profit margins.Additionally, rise in interest rate remains another concern as this would restrict the company’s ability to refinance existing debt and increase the interest cost on new debt. This might impact the company’s financial results and dividend payout.Simon Property has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1804,MAC,"The Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report) — a retail real estate investment trust (REIT) — is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 30, after the market closes. While its funds from operations (FFO) per share are anticipated to be up year over year, revenues might record a decline.Last quarter, the company reported FFO per share of 98 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.3%.Over the trailing four quarters, Macerich beat estimates in three occasions and posted in-line results in the other, generating an average positive beat of 2.17%.Macerich Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise  Macerich Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Macerich Company (The) QuoteHowever, the stock has lost 20% year to date, underperforming the 6.3% loss incurred by the industry it belongs to.Note: All EPS numbers presented in this write-up represent funds from operations (FFO) per share.Factors That Might Influence Q3 ResultsMacerich enjoys a portfolio of premium malls in vibrant U.S. markets. The presence of a number of well-capitalized retailers on its roster has enabled the company to maintain a stable source of rent for the past few quarters. Additionally, Macerich’s omni-channel distribution model, steadily rising demand, along with its tempered supply and aggressive capital-recycling program, augur well for growth.However, rising consumer purchases through the Internet has emerged as a pressing concern for this retail REIT. These have made retailers reconsider their footprint and eventually opt for store closures. Also, retailers not able to cope with competition have been filing bankruptcies.Subsequently, the company’s revenues from minimum rent will likely experience a marginal fall as compared to the prior quarter. The company realizes minimum rents on a straight-line basis. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter minimum rental revenues is currently pegged at $151 million. This indicates a 1.3% decline on a year-over-year basis.  Percentage rents, which is realized when tenants' sales targets have been met, is also anticipated to witness a steep year-over-year decline due to the tepid retail environment. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.57 million reflects a 33.6% plunge as compared to the prior-year quarter.   Macerich’s activities during the quarter were inadequate to gain analysts’ confidence. Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Q3 FFO remained unchanged at 98 cents over the past month.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Macerich will likely beat estimates this season. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

1805,MAC,"Regency Centers Corporation (REG  -  Free Report) announced that it has acquired Roosevelt Square — a multi-level shopping center — in Seattle, WA. The acquisition is in line with the retail real estate investment trust (REIT), which is seeking expansion in the market.The shopping center, spanning across 150,000 square feet of space, is located in the premium trade area of the Roosevelt neighborhood, which displays solid demographics. In fact, the shopping center is fully leased and is anchored by Whole Food.Per management, the acquisition is a strategic fit for the company as it is aimed at adding premium shopping centers in its urban portfolio on the back of acquisitions and developments. It anticipates that the property will draw decent footfall due to its proximity to the University of Washington and the neighboring communities.    Notably, with this buyout, the company is fortifying its presence in the market where it currently offers 1.5 million square feet of community serving retail options. In fact, Roosevelt Square marks the company’s 11th property in the market. Other existing properties include Broadway Market, Grand Ridge Plaza, Klahanie Shopping Center and Sammamish Highlands.Of late, mall traffic has been adversely affected due to the rapid shift in consumers’ shopping preferences toward online channels. With a number of retailers jumping on the dot-com bandwagon or reconsidering their footprint and opting for store closures, retail landlords, including The Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report), Taubman Centers (TCO  -  Free Report) and Kimco Realty Corporation (KIM  -  Free Report), have been facing challenging times.Amid these, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have underperformed the industry over the past year. While the company’s shares have declined 1.6%, the industry has gained 9.8% during the same time period. Nonetheless, at such a time, Regency is focused on building a premium portfolio of grocery-anchored shopping centers through tenant-driven acquisitions. Such centers are usually necessity driven and drive a dependable traffic.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

1806,MAC,"Realty Income (O  -  Free Report) is likely to remain on the growth curve with strategic acquisitions. During the nine-month period ended Sep 30, 2017, the company invested around $956.9 million in 177 new properties and properties under development or expansion, situated in 35 states. The assets are fully leased with a weighted average lease term of approximately 14.9 years.Per a video interview at REITworld 2017 with Nareit, the company’s CEO, John Case, mentioned that the company continues to witness solid investment opportunities and expects to complete around $1.5 billion of acquisitions in 2017. In fact, according to him, a bigger number of acquisitions are backing the 6% earnings per share increase projected by the company for the year.Moreover, in December, Realty Income announced a hike in its common stock monthly cash dividend, giving shareholders another reason to rejoice. This marks the company’s 94th dividend increase since its NYSE listing in 1994. The company will now pay 21.25 cents per share against 21.20 cents paid earlier. The increased dividend will be paid on Jan 12, 2018, to shareholders of record as of Jan 2, 2018.Notably, the company enjoys a trademark on the phrase “The Monthly Dividend Company”. The January 2018 dividend not only marks its 570th consecutive monthly payout in its 48-year operating history but also is the 81st consecutive quarterly increase. In fact, the company has generated a compound average annual dividend growth of around 4.6% since its listing on the NYSE. Given its financial position and lower debt-to-equity ratio compared with the industry, this dividend rate is likely to be sustainable.Realty Income’s portfolio comprised 5,062 properties, situated in 49 states and Puerto Rico as of Sep 30, 2017, containing more than 86.4 million leasable square feet of space. These properties are leased to 251 different commercial tenants, belonging to 47 separate industries. The company leases its properties under long-term, net lease agreements.Lately, shrinking footfall at malls amid shift of consumers toward online channels, store closures and bankruptcy of retailers have emerged as a pressing concerns for most retail REITs including Simon Property Group, Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report), GGP Inc. (GGP  -  Free Report) and Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report). However, not all are facing the brunt, as a few among these companies are still gaining even in the tepid scenario, thanks to the business models.In fact, this freestanding retail REIT, Realty Income, derives more than 90% of its annualized retail rental revenues from tenants belonging to service, non-discretionary and low-price retail business. Such businesses are less susceptible to economic recessions and competition from Internet retailing.Additionally, Realty Income’s solid underlying real estate quality and prudent underwriting at acquisition have helped the company maintain high occupancy levels consistently. In fact, since 1996, the company’s occupancy level has never been below 96%. Additionally, its same-store rent growth has displayed limited operational volatility.The company also maintains a conservative capital structure. It has modest leverage, robust liquidity and continued access to attractively priced equity and debt capital. Additionally, it has a well-laddered debt maturity schedule.However, Realty Income’s substantial exposure to single-tenant assets raises risks associated with tenant default. Moreover, despite the company’s efforts to diversify the tenant base, its tenants in the drug store industry accounted for around 10.8% of its rental revenue in third-quarter 2017. This makes the company’s results susceptible to any adverse changes in this industry, because a downturn in the industry or a change in legislation relating to prescription drugs, could substantially affect Realty Income’s tenants and in turn affect the revenue stream of the REIT. Further, rate hike add to its woes.Shares of Realty Income have outperformed the industry it belongs to, in a month’s time. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s shares have ascended 3.0%, while the industry registered growth of 2.3% during this time frame.

1807,MAC,"In the final leg of its disposition program, DDR Corp. (DDR  -  Free Report) announced the decision of the company’s board of directors to spin-off a portfolio of 50 sellable assets into a separate public-traded real estate investment trust (REIT) — Retail Value Trust (“RVT”).The split-up is seen as a business strategy to create two separate companies with distinct strategies. Post spin-off, DDR will own 236 properties exhibiting top-tier demographics and offering maximum scope for growth and redevelopment. On the other hand, RVT is expected to liquidate its entire portfolio within two to three years in order to realize the private market values for the company’s properties that are currently discounted by the public markets.The spin-off is likely to close in mid 2018, after which RVT will hold a portfolio of 38 continental U.S. assets and the entire Puerto Rico portfolio of 12 assets, valued at $3 billion as of Sep 30, 2017. These continental U.S. properties have a strong liquidity as compared to the assets worth $1 billion sold by DDR in the year so far.The Spin Co will be tied to a committed mortgage loan of $1.35 billion, the proceeds of which will be used to repay DDR’s debt. This will help DDR achieve its goal of Net Debt/Adjusted EBITDA of 6x for 2018 and strengthen the company’s balance sheet as well.The spin-off will transform DDR’s portfolio and contain significant re-leasing opportunities that will accelerate growth in net operating income (NOI). Its trimmed portfolio will no longer have exposure to Puerto Rico. This will enable DDR to maintain scale of operations and focus on core assets in the United States.RVT will be externally managed by DDR to capitalize on maximum cost efficiencies. DDR shareholders will receive shares of RVT through a taxable pro rata stock distribution. Further, no changes will be made to the company’s quarterly dividend prior to the RVT spinoff.   Such significant measures by the company demonstrate its priority to enhance portfolio mix and are accretive for long-term growth. However, growth of e-retailers at the expense of brick-and-mortar sales is a serious concern for this retail REIT. In fact, many retail landlords, including The Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report), Kimco Realty Corporation (KIM  -  Free Report) and Taubman Centers (TCO  -  Free Report), have been adversely affected due to consumers’ preferences increasingly shifting toward online retail. This has also resulted in widespread store closures and bankruptcy filing by the retailers.Amid the lackluster retail environment, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has underperformed its industry year to date. Shares of DDR have plunged 47.9%, as compared to the industry’s gain of 12%.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization.

1808,MAC,"DDR Corp (DDR  -  Free Report) has been putting in strategic efforts to revamp its portfolio through an aggressive capital-recycling program. However, this involves large scale dispositions which are anticipated to impact the company’s bottom-line performance in the near term.Specifically, this retail real estate investment trust (REIT) intends reducing currency and development risks, as well as expanding its presence in upscale U.S. markets through strategic asset management. Hence, the company is shedding non-core and non-income producing assets, and reinvesting the proceeds in premium U.S. shopping centers.Apart from portfolio restructuring, DDR is also enhancing its capital structure and improving liquidity. In September, the company refinanced two revolving credit facilities that expanded its line of credit and extended maturities. In fact, it has a well-laddered debt maturity profile with no significant unsecured debt maturing until 2021.DDR remains focused on its deleveraging process as it continues to sell assets. Notably, the company sold $392 million of assets in the third quarter, in addition to the $237 million in the second quarter. Further, the company sold an additional $190 million shortly after the end of the recently-reported quarter.While these dispositions are likely to enhance its portfolio mix, the near-term dilution effect of such moves is unavoidable.  In fact, the dilutive impact of deleveraging generated through sale of assets was primarily responsible for the decline in third-quarter 2017 funds from operations (FFO) from the prior-year quarter.Moreover, the retail apocalypse has considerably curbed demand for the retail real estate space in the United States. Mall traffic has been adversely affected and retail landlords, including DDR, Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report), Taubman Centers (TCO  -  Free Report) and Kimco Realty Corporation (KIM  -  Free Report), are suffering due to consumers’ preferences increasingly shifting toward online retail. This has resulted in widespread store closures and bankruptcy filing by the retailers. In fact, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have underperformed its industry in the year so far. During this time frame, the stock has tanked 48.4%, whereas the industry has registered growth of 9.8%.

1809,MAC,"Kimco Realty Corporation (KIM  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 25, after the market closes. Both its revenues and funds from operations (FFO) per share are anticipatedto be up year over year.Last quarter, this New Hyde Park, NY-based retail real estate investment trust (REIT) reported in-line results with respect to FFO per share. The company also recorded the strongest leasing volume in the past decade.Over the trailing four quarters, Kimco beat estimates in one occasion and posted in-line results in the other three, recording an average beat of 30.9%. The graph below depicts this surprise history:Kimco Realty Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Kimco Realty Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Kimco Realty Corporation QuoteHowever, the stock has lost 23.7% year to date versus the industry's loss of 4%.Note: All EPS numbers presented here represent funds from operations (FFO) per share.Factors to Influence Q3 ResultsKimco has been taking long strides and is progressing well with its strategic 2020 Vision. The company has been purchasing premium assets in key U.S. markets and carrying out joint-venture buyouts. Its efforts included exit from Canada as well as exodus from secondary markets.In fact, in July, Kimco announced the purchase of Jantzen Beach Center for $131.8 million. This is the company’s eighth property in the Portland-Vancouver-Hillsboro MSA. The move comes as part of Kimco’s strategic 2020 Vision that envisages portfolio-quality upgrade with premium acquisitions in selective locations, financed by proceeds reaped from dispositions.Further, the company is engaged in the execution of strategic measures to boost the capital structure, and enhance its growth profile and tax efficiency.However, the increasing number of retailers jumping on the dot-com bandwagon has created pressure on the top-line figure for this REIT. A number ofretailers are filing for bankruptcy and opting for store closures, as mall traffic has been shrinking due to the soaring online purchases. Although retail REITs like Kimco are actively enhancing the omni-channel capabilities and heavily investing in redevelopment to draw customers, it may take a while for these efforts to offset the dent created in the operating results.Furthermore, as part of its portfolio upgrade strategy, Kimco is aggressively disposing non-core assets. While such efforts are encouraging for the long term, the earnings dilution led by high disposition activity cannot be averted in the near term. Therefore, these moves are expected to hurt the company’s growth momentum in the to-be-reported quarter.Kimco’s activities during the quarter could not gain adequate analyst confidence. Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for funds from operations for the third quarter remained unchanged at 38 cents, over the past month.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Kimco will likely beat estimates this season. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, that is not the case here as you will see below. (You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.)Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Kimco is 0.00%.Zacks Rank: Kimco currently has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.

1810,MAC,"Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report)), similar to other retail real estate investment trusts (REIT), has been facing high tenant turnover for its real estate amid a rising trend in online purchases. Hence, the company is focusing on enhancing its assets quality and customer relationships.Specifically, Macerich is increasingly adopting the omni-channel model in its brick-and-mortar space to strengthen its retail platform. This is anticipated to boost the shopping experience and bolster sales volume at tenant stores, in turn, raising demand for Macerich’s properties.Further, a recovering economy amid better employment scenario is likely to drive demand for retail goods. Consequently, this is an opportune moment for Macerich to provide real estate support to the retail sector. Additionally, there is limited supply of new properties in the market.In fact, Macerich announced that its retail mall — Tysons Corner Center — will add four retail brand outlets in its shopping center. These consist of Superdry, Shinola, Charles Tyrwhitt and Origins.Macerich’s portfolio has a high concentration of premium malls in certain vibrant U.S. markets. In addition, Tysons Corner Center is one of the top performing malls in the nation. It is one of the many high-end properties present in the company’s portfolio.However, as online purchases are taking precedence over in-store purchases, a number of retailers are jumping on the dot-com bandwagon and optimizing their brick-and-mortar presence. These efforts and the consequent decision to close stores by several retailers have raised concerns over cash flows of mall landlords.Also, retailers unable to cope with competition have been filing bankruptcies. This is adversely affecting the demand for retail real estate space and has emerged as a pressing concern for retail REITs. While Macerich is striving to counter such pressure through various initiatives, we believe this factor poses a challenge to the company’s growth. We also expect that this will likely restrict any improvement in margins in the near term.Further, interest rate risks and substantial assets concentration in California and Arizona remain concerns for Macerich.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have underperformed the industry it belongs to, year to date. Macerich’s shares have lost 23.2% versus the industry’s 4.1% decline during the same time frame. In addition, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for funds from operation (FFO) per share for third-quarter 2017 moved 1% downward to 98 cents over the past 60 days, while the 2017 FFO estimate edged down 0.7% to $3.95 in a week’s time.Key PicksBetter-ranked stocks in the REIT space include Getty Realty Corporation (GTY  -  Free Report), Seritage Growth Properties  and Communications Sales & Leasing, Inc.

1811,MAC,"Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc. (HPP  -  Free Report) and Macerich (MAC  -  Free Report) are forming a joint venture to transform the iconic mall, The Westside Pavilion to an office space. Macerich, which is the owner of the property, handed over the property to the joint venture and is retaining 25% interest while Hudson Pacific has become the majority owner having 75% share.Shrinking footfall amid shift of consumers toward online channels, store closures and bankruptcy of retailers are some of the reasons why mall landlords are shifting from retail.Westside Pavilion, which spans across approximately 600,000 square feet, will only retain 100,000 square feet as its existing “entertainment retail space.” While the other 500,000 square feet of the shopping center will be transformed into “state-of-the-art creative office space.”The total project costs, which include the asset value, are anticipated to be around $425-$475 million. The costs will be borne by both the companies in the share of their ownership interests in the joint venture.Hudson Pacific will be responsible for the day-to-day operations and management of the project which is expected to be completed by mid-2021.Chairman and CEO of Macerich, Art Coppola thinks that this joint venture will allow them to use the well-located mall to its best capacity.

1813,MAC,"Regency Centers Corporation’s (REG  -  Free Report) focus on building a premium portfolio of grocery-anchored shopping centers, aimed at driving dependable traffic, bodes well. However, the company’s growing development and redevelopment pipeline exposes it to various risks such as rising construction costs, entitlement delays and lease-ups.  Specifically, this retail real estate investment trust (REIT) has 80% of its properties anchored by leading grocers, which augurs well for steady cash flows and long-term growth. Moreover, long-term leases with its tenants protect the company from short-term market swings.Amid these, Regency is also focusing on the acquisition of grocery-anchored properties. Its merger with Equity One created a high-quality portfolio of more than 400 properties — mainly grocery anchored. Moreover, strategic acquisitions will strengthen its foothold in thriving sub-markets.A healthy balance sheet also enables Regency to pursue its growth plans. Importantly, as of Dec 31, 2017, 85.7% of the company’s wholly owned real estate assets were unencumbered. This will enable the company to enjoy favorable access to secured and unsecured debt markets. Notably, this March, the company amended a $1.25-billion unsecured revolving credit facility. This will help drive operational efficiency and financial flexibility.However, the retail apocalypse has considerably curbed demand for retail real estate space in the United States. Mall traffic has been affected and retail landlords, including Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report), Taubman Centers (TCO  -  Free Report) and Kimco Realty Corporation (KIM  -  Free Report), are suffering due to consumers’ preferences increasingly shifting toward online retail. This has resulted in widespread store closures and bankruptcy filing by the retailers. In fact, deeper penetration of online retailers into the grocery business has emerged as a pressing concern for the company.As the company continues to counter mall traffic blues, Regency is increasingly investing in development and redevelopment projects. It had 19 properties, with estimated cost of $454 million in development or redevelopment, at the end of the first quarter. With a huge outlay for refurbishments, growth in profit margins of the company in the near term will likely remain limited.Regency has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1817,MAC,"The Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report) — a retail real estate investment trust (REIT) — is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 2 after the market closes. Its revenues and funds from operations (“FFO”) for the quarter are expected to witness a year-over-year decline.Last quarter, the company reported FFO per share of 87 cents, delivering a positive earnings surprise of 3.57%.Macerich beat estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, witnessing an average positive earnings surprise of 2.40%. The graph below depicts this surprise history. Macerich Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise  Macerich Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Macerich Company (The) QuoteNote: The EPS presented in the above chart represents funds from operations (FFO) per share.Factors to Influence Q2 ResultsThe company enjoys a portfolio of premium malls in the vibrant U.S. markets. The presence of a number of well-capitalized retailers on its roster has enabled the company to maintain a stable source of rent for the past few quarters. Additionally, the company’s omni-channel distribution model, steadily rising demand, along with tempered supply and aggressive capital-recycling program augur well for growth.However, a geographically concentrated portfolio, along with increasing consumer purchases through the internet, has emerged as a pressing concern for this retail REIT. These have made retailers reconsider their footprint and eventually opt for store closures. Also, retailers not able to cope with competition have been filing bankruptcies.Macerich’s extensive development projects increase its operational risks and are likely to hinder any growth in margins. Further, a rise in interest rate is a concern for the company as this would affect its financial flexibility.In addition, Macerich’s activities during the quarter were inadequate to gain analyst confidence. Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Q2 FFO remained unchanged at 94 cents over the last 30 days.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Macerich will likely beat FFO estimates this time around. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, that is not the case here as you will see below.(You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.)Zacks ESP: The Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 95 cents and 94 cents, respectively, translating into an Earnings ESP of +1.06%.Zacks Rank: Macerich currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which actually reduces the predictive power of ESP.The stock has lost 18.3% year to date, underperforming the 4.6% decline of the industry it belongs to.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few stocks in the REIT space that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to report a positive surprise this time around:Regency Centres Corporation (REG  -  Free Report), scheduled to release second-quarter results on Aug 3, has an Earnings ESP of +1.12% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.CyrusOne Inc (CONE  -  Free Report), slated to release earnings on Aug 2, has an Earnings ESP of +2.70% and a Zacks Rank #2.Ramco-Gershenson Properties Trust (RPT  -  Free Report), set to release quarterly numbers on Aug 1, has an Earnings ESP of +2.94% and a Zacks Rank #3.Note: FFO, a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs, is obtained after adding depreciation and amortization and other non-cash expenses to net income.More Stock News: 8 Companies Verge on Apple-Like RunDid you miss Apple's 9X stock explosion after they launched their iPhone in 2007?

1818,MAC,"Retail REIT Federal Realty Investment Trust (FRT  -  Free Report) is likely to remain on the growth curve backed by its premium retail assets, diverse tenant base and efforts to improve operating performance through expansion, renovation and re-tenanting support long-term profitability. However, the choppy retail real estate environment and portfolio redevelopment efforts might limit the company’s growth tempo in the near term.Recently, Federal Realty reported fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted funds from operations (FFO) per share of $1.47, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Adjusted FFO per share also compared favorably with the prior-year quarter tally of $1.45. Results reflect growth in revenues. However, the company’s proactive releasing efforts to reposition properties had an adverse impact on its quarterly results.Specifically, Federal Realty has a portfolio of premium retail assets — mainly situated in the major coastal markets from Washington, D.C. to Boston, San Francisco and Los Angeles — which positions it well for decent growth. Again, due to the strong demographics and in-fill nature of its properties, the company has been able to maintain a high occupancy and rental rates.In addition, Federal Realty has a decent balance-sheet position, with ample liquidity and is continuing with its efforts to boost shareholders’ wealth. The company has paid uninterrupted dividends since its inception in 1962 and its compound annual growth rate of dividend increases over the past 50 years is above 7%. Given the company’s financial position and lower debt-to-equity ratio compared to that of the industry, this dividend rate is expected to be sustainable.However, shrinking footfall at malls amid shift of consumers toward online channels, store closures and bankruptcy of retailers have emerged as pressing concerns for most retail REITs, including Simon Property Group, Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report), GGP Inc. (GGP  -  Free Report), The Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report), Federal Realty and others.Additionally, amid a fast changing retail environment, the company is making commendable efforts to reposition, redevelop and re-merchandise its portfolio. This includes an upgradation of the tenant mix. Although repositioning and redevelopment are a strategic fit for long-term growth, such initiatives involve considerable upfront costs and tend to drag down near-term profitability. In fact, the company’s proactive releasing efforts to reposition properties had an adverse impact on its recently-reported quarterly results.Moreover, rise in interest rate can pose a challenge for Federal Realty. This is because the company’s ability to refinance its existing debt would be restricted, while interest cost on new debt will increase. This could adversely affect the company’s financial results and consequently dent its dividend payout. Also, the dividend payout might become less attractive than the yields on fixed income and money market accounts.Amid these, shares of Federal Realty have underperformed the industry it belongs to, over the past three months, depreciating 11.3% as against the 8.0% loss incurred by the industry. Nevertheless, reflecting bullish analyst sentiment, the stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share for first-quarter 2018 being revised 0.7% upward in a month’s time.

1819,MAC,"Retail REIT The Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report) delivered fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted funds from operations (FFO) per share of $1.13, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a cent. Results reflect decline in occupancy in the quarter. Moreover, revenues slipped from the prior-year period as well.Including the $14.5-million re-valuation reduction of a deferred tax asset because of the lower federal corporate income tax rates, FFO per share for the quarter came in at $1.03 compared with $1.17 in the prior-year period.The company posted revenues of $256.7 million for the fourth quarter, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $234.4 million. However, the figure came in 5.6% lower than the prior-year quarter figure.For full-year 2017, FFO per share came in at $3.83, down 6.1% from the year-ago tally of $4.08. The company also experienced a 4.6% year-over-year decline in revenues to nearly $993.7 million.Quarter in DetailAs of Dec 31, 2017, mall portfolio occupancy contracted 40 basis points (bps) year over year to 95.0%. Mall tenant annual sales increased 4.8% year over year to $660 per square feet. Re-leasing spreads for the year ended Dec 31, 2017, increased 15.2%. Average rent per square foot increased 3.8% to $56.97 from $54.87 as of Dec 31, 2016.Also, same-center net operating income for the reported quarter grew around 2.4% from the prior-year period.As of Dec 31, 2017, Macerich’s cash and cash equivalents were $91.0 million, up from $71.1 million as of Sep 30, 2017.GuidanceMacerich offered its guidance for 2018. The retail REIT expects FFO per share in the range of $3.92-$4.02. This is backed by same-center NOI growth rate projection of 2.0-2.5% and no asset sales or acquisitions assumptions. Currently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share is pegged at $4.07.Our ViewpointDwindling footfall amid shift of consumers toward online channels, store closures and bankruptcy of retailers are anticipated to adversely affect the company’s performance in the near term. While Macerich has been striving to counter the pressure through efforts to support omni-channel retailing and portfolio revamp, implementation of such measures requires a decent upfront cost and therefore, might limit any robust growth in profit margins in the near term. Furthermore, interest rate hikes and portfolio concentration remain concerns for the company.Currently, Macerich has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

1822,MAC,"The current reporting cycle has already crossed the half-way mark and results are still pouring in from the real estate investment trust (REIT) industry. In fact, on Aug 2, a number of S&P 500 constituents – residential REIT AvalonBay Communities, Inc. (AVB  -  Free Report), data center REIT Equinix, Inc. (EQIX  -  Free Report), and retail REITs Federal Realty Investment Trust (FRT  -  Free Report), GGP Inc. (GGP  -  Free Report), The Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report) – are slated to release quarterly figures.So far, results from the broader market revealed broad-based growth, record earnings tally, an abundance of positive surprises and favorable trends on the revisions front. (Read more: Q2 Earnings Season Past the Halfway Mark)Nevertheless, the performance of the REIT sector has so far been mixed, with results from some of the top notch REIT stocks either matching estimates or beating, and a few others falling shy of expectations.Admittedly, rate hike and cautious approach of investors have deterred gains from this industry so far this year. However, with underlying asset categories and the location of properties playing a crucial role in determining the performance of REITs, not all players in the space have equally excelled or fallen behind.In fact, defying concerns about supply in the market, the residential real estate market is back with a bang, driven by robust demand levels. Per a study by the real estate technology and analytics firm, RealPage, Inc. (RP  -  Free Report), the second-quarter demand level of 175,645 apartments across the nation marked one-third increase from the level witnessed a year ago. This helped occupancy to remain high at 95.0% as of mid-year and led to stabilization in the annual pace of rent growth, which came in at 3.6%, close to 3.7% growth experienced in the first quarter. Notably, job formation and checked move-outs for buying homes acted as the catalyst.Moreover, with growth in cloud computing, Internet of Things and big data, and an increasing number of companies opting for third-party IT infrastructure, data center REITs are experiencing a boom market. In fact, demand has been outpacing supply in top tier data center markets. Despite enjoying high occupancy, these markets are absorbing new construction at a faster pace.On the other hand, we note that mall traffic continues to decline owing to a change in shopping patterns. Online purchases have taken precedence over in-store purchase. This has forced retailers to reconsider their strategy and shift investments from traditional retailing to online channels and optimize their brick-and-mortar presence.While it is quite normal for retailers to do so, these optimization efforts and the consequent decision to close stores by a number of reputable retailers like Macy’s Inc. (M  -  Free Report), Sears Holdings Corporation (SHLD) and JC Penney (JCP) in recent months, have raised concerns over cash flows of mall landlords. Also, retailers unable to cope with competition have been filing bankruptcies. This is resulting in higher vacancy in existing malls.    Therefore, not all players in the REIT space are equally poised to excel this time around. To predict that, we rely on the Zacks methodology, combining a favorable Zacks Rank – Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) – and a positive Earnings ESP. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Per our proprietary methodology, Earnings ESP shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Research shows that with this combination of rank and ESP, chances of a positive earnings surprise are as high as 70% for the stocks.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Let’s have a look at what’s in store for the five REITs set to release second-quarter results on Wednesday:Arlington, VA-based, residential REIT AvalonBay is well poised to grow on the back of a rising demand from household formation and favorable demographics. In addition, increasing consumer confidence, on the back of job growth, rising wages, and a healthier balance sheet, promise bright prospects for the company. The company is likely to continue experiencing high occupancy. Although pace of rental growth has slowed down from the previous years, it is now likely to achieve stability. (Read more: Can AvalonBay Pull Off A Surprise in Q2 Earnings?)AvalonBay has an Earnings ESP of +0.94 %. This positive ESP combined with its Zacks Rank #3, increases the chances of a positive surprise this season.Over the trailing four quarters, with respect to FFO per share, the company surpassed estimates in one occasion and missed in the other three. This resulted in an average negative surprise of 0.84%. The graph below depicts the surprise history of the company:AvalonBay Communities, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  AvalonBay Communities, Inc.

The company operates across various geographical regions and its increasing popularity among major tech industry players looking for data management will likely drive revenues in the second quarter.However, we remain slightly cautious about the huge capital outlays, which may dent Equinix’s second-quarter profitability.

1823,MAC,"The Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report) — a retail real estate investment trust (REIT) — is scheduled to report fourth-quarter and 2017 results on Feb 5, after the market closes. Its funds from operations (FFO) per share and revenues are anticipated to decline year over year.Last quarter, the company reported FFO per share of 96 cents, lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2%. Results reflected a decrease in portfolio occupancy and total revenues. Nonetheless, the quarter witnessed improvement in same-center net operating income (NOI).Over the trailing four quarters, Macerich beat estimates on three occasions and missed once, resulting in an average beat of 1.66%. This is depicted in the chart below:Macerich Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise Macerich Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Macerich Company (The) QuoteFurther, the stock has outperformed the industry. While the company’s shares have gained 11%, the industry has rallied 10.1% over the past six months.Factors That Might Influence Q4 ResultsMacerich enjoys a portfolio of premium malls in vibrant U.S. markets. The presence of a number of well-capitalized retailers in its portfolio enabled the company to maintain a stable source of rent for the past few quarters. Additionally, Macerich’s omni-channel distribution model, steadily rising demand and aggressive capital-recycling program amid modest supply, augur well for growth.Nevertheless, mall traffic continues to remain considerably depressed with more and more consumers opting for online purchases. This has led to an increasing number of retailers jumping on the dot-com bandwagon. Retailers are also reconsidering their footprint and opting for store closures.Furthermore, retailers unable to keep up with the intense competition in the industry have been filing bankruptcies. This is a pressing concern for retail REITs, as the trend has been significantly dragging down demand for the retail real estate space. This choppy retail real estate market situation is also said to have led to tenants demanding substantial lease concessions, though the mall landlords find it unjustified.Subsequently, the company’s minimum rental revenues will likely experience a fall from the prior-year quarter. The company realizes minimum rents on a straight-line basis. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter minimum rental revenues is currently pegged at $151 million. This indicates a 5% decline on a year-over-year basis.  Percentage rents, realized when tenants' specified sales targets have been met, is also anticipated to witness a steep year-over-year decline due to the tepid retail environment. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.87 million reflects a 15% plunge from the prior-year quarter.  Prior to the fourth-quarter earnings release, there is lack of any solid catalyst for raising optimism about the company’s business activities and prospects. As such, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share in the soon-to-be-reported quarter remained unchanged at $1.14, over the past month. Further, this indicates a decline of 2.6% year over year.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $234.4 million, indicating a year-over-year fall of 13.8%.For full-year 2017, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues stands at $888.7 million. The consensus estimate for FFO per is $3.94, reflecting a year-over-year decrease of 3.2%. Management expects FFO per share in the range of $3.90-$4.00.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Macerich will likely beat estimates this season. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, that is not the case here as you will see below.(You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.)Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Macerich is -0.59%.Zacks Rank: Macerich has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few stocks in the REIT space that you may want to consider as our model shows these have the right combination of elements to report a positive surprise this time around:CubeSmart (CUBE  -  Free Report), slated to release fourth-quarter results on Feb 15, has an Earnings ESP of +1.10% and a Zacks Rank #3.

1824,MAC,"DDR Corp. (DDR  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter 2017 funds from operations (FFO) per share of 30 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 cents. However, the number declined 3 cents from the prior-year quarter.Dilutive effect of deleveraging generated through sale of assets was primarily responsible for the decline in FFO.This real estate investment trust (REIT) posted revenues of $227.4 million for the second quarter, marginally missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $228 million. The figure also came in lower than $245.8 million recorded in the prior-year quarter.DDR Corp. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  DDR Corp. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | DDR Corp. QuoteNote: The EPS numbers presented in the above chart represent funds from operations (FFO) per share.Quarter in DetailDDR signed 258 new and renewal leases for 1.9 million square feet of space during the quarter.

This resulted in asset sale and loan repayment proceeds of $237.5 million, aggregating to $225.7 million. Recovering from large scale tenant bankruptcy, the company displayed strong financial results and efficient operational execution.However, declining same-store net operating income growth, fall in occupancy and the dilutive effects of divestitures cannot be ignored. Also, rate hike and competition from other retailers, such as e-commerce and catalogs, add to its woes.Currently, DDR carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.
