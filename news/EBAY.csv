The stock jumped nearly 5% in premarket trading after closing up 0.3% at 98.42.Texas Instruments isn't just one of the biggest chipmakers but also fairly diverse, with big exposure to the mobile and automotive markets. So TI's results are a good indicator for chips and end markets.STMicroelectronics (STM), chip-gear maker MKS Instruments (MKSI) and LED-chip maker Cree (CREE) also jumped overnight on their results.But big-cap chip-equipment maker Teradyne (TER) tumbled overnight on weak guidance. Teradyne warned of weak demand for equipment to test mobile devices.That's not the most recent chip warning directly tied to smartphone weakness. Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM), which makes a lot of chips for Intel, Nvidia and others, cited phone woes in its grim outlook last week.Still, the SOXX ETF rose a fraction in premarket trading.Intel, which reports earnings Thursday, rose 0.5% in Wednesday's premarket. On Tuesday, Intel closed up 0.7% at 51.45 after hitting 53.64 intraday, nearly retaking a 53.88 flat-base entry.Nvidia was indicated slightly lower after initially showing a modest gain.Remember that after-hours action in stock futures as well as individual stocks and ETFs doesn't always translate into regular-session gains.Chip stocks are a huge share of the market, especially in the Nasdaq. Chips are in so many products, from PCs, servers and smartphones like the Apple iPhone, to also ""non-tech"" products such as cars and appliances. So if semis are faring poorly, it's not a good sign for end demand in many industries. That's a big reason why last week's weak outlooks from contract chip giant Taiwan Semi and equipment makers Lam Research (LRCX) and ASML (ASML) have hurt the broader stock market.  Apple lost 1.4% on Tuesday after undercutting its 200-day line Monday.

The industrial giant also raised its full-year adjusted EPS and sales forecast.Lockheed Martin (LMT) topped first-quarter estimates and the defense contractor raised EPS and revenue targets.

Ford will not invest in traditional sedans for North America going forward, and will almost phase out passenger cars by 2020, as consumers migrate to SUVs and light trucks. GM still sees small cars as an opportunity at home and abroad, even as it too shifts focus to larger and more profitable vehicles.Casino operator Las Vegas Sands (LVS) topped first-quarter results estimates, helped by strong demand in global gaming hub Macau and in Singapore. Macau also helped Q1 results for Wynn Resorts (WYNN), but its overall and Macau sales disappointed some analysts. Wynn Resorts also approved a dividend increase. The earnings report from Wynn was the first since Steve Wynn resigned as CEO and sold his stake following allegations of sexual misconduct.

Homebuilder stocks rallied for solid gains, helped by cooling Treasury yields. New-home sales rose in March to an annualized sales pace of 694,000 units, a four-month high. Meanwhile existing-home prices rose 6.8% in February vs. a year earlier.China search-engine leader Baidu (BIDU) reported a Q1 profit that blew past estimates, lifting shares.

Stocks pulled back as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) warned on the rest of 2018, citing weak smartphone demand. Already pressured by weak ASML (ASML) and Lam Research (LRCX) guidance, chip stocks sold off. Apple (AAPL) also came under heavy pressure Thursday and Friday on iPhone demand concerns.

Since then, more than half of steel imports have been exempted.General Electric (GE) reported a smaller-than-expected adjusted EPS decline, with revenue rising more than expected.

23,EBAY,"Here we go again. State politicians want to take more of your money. This time, their scheme is to tax everything you buy on the internet.On Tuesday, the money-grabbing states made their case to the United States Supreme Court. If the Justices go along with it, you'll be paying more when you make a purchase on eBay, Etsy, Amazon or another platform hosting small retailers.Shoppers won't be the only losers. If the justices side with the states in South Dakota v. Wayfair, mom-and-pop internet businesses and startups will be stymied by the complexity of collecting taxes for 12,000 different state, county and municipal taxing jurisdictions. Each jurisdiction has its own rates, rules and deadlines. Yikes. Retail giants can afford expensive software to do the job, but for smaller businesses it would be a logistical nightmare, shutting down many.Ethos Dynamics, a business with six employees, sells refurbished IT equipment online. Juliette and Lyle Gore, who launched Ethos, say they'll be ""overwhelmed"" if the Court orders them to collect taxes from every buyer.Last year, 1.9 million entrepreneurs used Etsy to sell their products. Forcing these sellers to collect taxes would extinguish startups and cost millions of jobs. For example, John Davis, an ex-Marine, and his wife started an online business selling collectibles to fund the cost of adopting children. ""We hope the justices of the Supreme Court will remember the millions of people like us."" The Davises say they don't have ""staff, lawyers or accountants"" to collect taxes. If the states win in the Supreme Court, ""a lot of us could be out of business.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAt Tuesday's oral argument, Justice Sonia Sotomayor raised that concern. ""What are we going to do with the costs that you're going to put on small businesses?"" she asked the lawyer advocating for internet taxes.That same concern led the Court in two previous cases to bar states from forcing out-of-state businesses like L.L. Bean and Sears to collect sales tax from customers. The Court reasoned that forcing businesses without stores or warehouses in a state to collect sales taxes there would put a damper on a vibrant, interconnected national economy.But state lawmakers now claim they're ""losing"" billions of dollars in revenue because of the Court's past rulings. Losing? These politicians talk like the money belongs to them, not to the people who earned it.Last year, lawmakers in South Dakota, a state that relies heavily on sales taxation and has no income tax, decided to defy the Court head on. They slapped taxes on everything sold in the state via the internet and sued online retailers like Wayfair, a home-goods dealer, to pay up.Other states, including New York, are watching the outcome of the case, salivating at the possibility of collecting taxes on all internet sales. Governor Andrew Cuomo has tried to enact a $75 million tax hike on New York internet shoppers. So far, the legislature has balked, refusing to nickel-and-dime consumers. That will likely change if the Justices greenlight these taxes.Will they? The case is a nail-biter. Justice Anthony Kennedy, often a swing vote, has said the Court should re-examine its ban on states taxing internet sales. On Tuesday, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg seemed sympathetic to the tax-hungry states. But Justice Samuel Alito worried that if the Court gave states the go-ahead, some would ""grab everything they possibly can,"" regardless of the harm to internet retailers or consumers. Several justices suggested deferring to Congress, which has wisely declined to sanction more taxes on internet sales.Online shoppers and internet entrepreneurs are in the crosshairs in this case. As Alito has reminded the Court before, the Constitution's framers wanted to prevent states from imposing taxes and regulations that discourage the free flow of goods and services across the nation. This was vital to the nation's economy in 1787, and still is today.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Bankrupt Public-Employee Pensions: The Next Big Financial Crisis?Why Does The Left Oppose Work Requirements For Welfare?Forget Facebook, Here's The Real Privacy Scandal

The maker of the da Vinci robotic surgical system reported a 25% gain in earnings per share and an 18% rise in revenue for its first quarter late Tuesday. The number of surgical systems shipped soared 39% during the quarter, with procedures performed using the da Vinci system rising 15%.Defense contractor Textron powered up 7.2% in the stock market today, after scoring big beats in its first-quarter revenue and earnings. The premarket move implies a starting bell breakout above a 62.29 buy point in a two-month flat base.

25,EBAY,"When PayPal (PYPL) split from online auction site eBay (EBAY) in 2015, Wall Street wondered whether the digital-payments provider would truly find its place in the world of ushering money between people online.XCould it stand up to Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA), they wondered. Would it be able to justify its existence alongside Facebook (FB) and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google? Could it compete with basically any of the large banks, who had plenty of reasons to offer payment services themselves?Rather than go to war, PayPal has reached truces, of sorts, with those and other companies since the spin-off from eBay. The strategy has sent its stock on a marathon run higher. It's also extended the company's reach online, into the muscle memory of smartphone users, and into any moment where someone might think to pay for something. It has also given PayPal a foothold in actual, physical stores, which still make up the vast majority of retail.Today, PayPal users can draw on a Mastercard or Visa card or their bank account to pay for something via their phone in such retail locations. In May, PayPal said users would be able to pay for stuff on Gmail, YouTube and other locations in the Google ecosphere. PayPal last year struck a deal with Facebook that allowed someone to send money via Facebook Messenger.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""That's really helped them become much more of a partner, obviously, than a competitor with a lot of these companies,"" Edward Jones analyst Josh Olson said. ""I think that's helped ease Wall Street's concerns about whether a big tech company would just leapfrog them or make their technology obsolete.""The company also counts Bank of America (BAC) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) as partners, and is trying to attract more people without bank accounts. In moves abroad, the company last year struck a deal with Chinese search giant Baidu (BIDU) to let Baidu Wallet holders buy things from PayPal merchants.In May, it announced the $2.2 billion purchase of iZettle, a Stockholm-based company sometimes called the Square (SQ) of Europe. The deal is likely to put PayPal's technology into retail outlets across that continent as well as Latin America.How sustainable these partnerships are over the long term remains an open question. Competition from Square, best known for the card readers often used by small businesses, is nothing to sneeze at. PayPal's margins have been under pressure as it chases bigger customers, Olson says. EBay's decision this year to eventually handle more payments on its own — rather than PayPal — is a big deal.But for now, analysts suggest that more freedom from eBay has allowed PayPal to come into its own. The collaboration-over-competition approach, along with the growing ease and popularity of online payments, has sent its stock up 126% since the company's 2015 spinoff. Over the past year alone, the stock is up nearly 60% and maintains an IBD Composite Rating of 96. Shares were down fractionally to 85.31 Friday.Even as competition escalates, the company in May said it was targeting around a 20% compound annual earnings per share growth rate over the next three to five years. Over that time, it also forecasts expanding adjusted operating margins and 17%-18% compound annual sales growth, when factoring foreign exchange fluctuations.In years past, the firm tried to encourage customers to link their PayPal accounts with their bank accounts. The practice helped the company avoid paying fees to the credit card networks, making those companies dyspeptic. Visa's chief executive in 2016 warned that the card network could try to compete with the payments company ""in ways that people have never seen before.""PayPal eventually backed off, agreeing later that year to partner with Visa. The agreement expanded the ""acceptance for PayPal's digital wallet to all physical retail locations where Visa contactless transactions are enabled,"" according to a statement announcing the deal.The deal also allowed customers to instantly move money from their PayPal and Venmo accounts to their bank account via a Visa debit card, that statement said. Shortly after, PayPal and Mastercard announced a similar pact that expanded an existing partnership.""It just made it a lot easier for individual consumers to sign up for PayPal,"" William Blair analyst Bob Napoli said of its increased flexibility.The company's active customer accounts grew 15% last year. In the first quarter, reported in April, it added 8.1 million active accounts, with payment transactions up 25%. The company has 218 million active users in more than 200 markets. It processes around one in every six dollars spent online, according to Edward Jones.""Embracing the traditional payment ecosystem was a positive in many investors' eyes,"" Baird analyst Colin Sebastian said.What's more, analysts say, the company's technology is good, and it works on lots of things with which you can make payments. Its One Touch technology allows customers to buy things online without entering their password and other information. The company rolled out its own cash-back credit card last summer. The company was testing a Venmo debit card, Recode reported earlier last year.As PayPal makes it easier to pay for things, businesses have taken notice. The company has some 19 million merchant accounts, most of them small to midsize businesses.""I think, (they) have signed up, and continue to sign up, more merchants post-spinoff from eBay that maybe wouldn't have been able to sign when they were part of eBay,"" Napoli said.Still, a big chunk of PayPal's financials hinge on eBay's auction activity. EBay acquired the company in 2002 to make it easier for eBay's buyers and sellers to pay or get paid online. Last year, PayPal drew around a fifth of its revenue from customers on eBay's Marketplaces platform.But in January, the online auction platform said it would begin managing payments on its own. It said that process will be a ""—multiyear journey."" EBay also said it would use Adyen, a Netherlands-based company, as its payments processor. PayPal's stock crashed on eBay's announcement. PayPal will remain a payment option on eBay until mid-2023.The payments company seems likely to compensate by reeling in bigger retailers elsewhere. But Olson notes that its pursuit of larger customers has weighed on margins. Those companies have more bargaining power to negotiate lower fees, he says.Analysts also debate whether it has the upper hand on Square, the payments company best known for its credit-card readers used by small businesses. Square also is stepping up efforts to compete with PayPal via acquisitions.On one hand, PayPal has a massive network of millions of users. The purchase of iZettle would unite PayPal's immense digital platform with iZettle's card readers and software tools for small businesses. But small businesses comprise the turf upon which Square has built much of its reputation.Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) still has Apple Pay, although PayPal last year landed a deal to allow iTunes users to buy things with PayPal. The Wall Street Journal reported in March that Amazon (AMZN) was looking into developing something similar to a branded checking account. As long as tech and financial companies work in the payments business, friction could wear at PayPal's partnerships.""Long-term, it's harder to say,"" Sebastian said of how those partnerships will hold up. ""PayPal still has many elements of duplicating what a credit card offers.""So there's always the prospect, if PayPal were to potentially turn (to) a competitive angle vs. a partnership angle,"" he said. ""But I certainly don't foresee that in the near term or the medium term.""RELATED LINKS:Square, PayPal Lead These 5 Financial Stocks In Or Near Buy ZonesBest Growth Stocks To Buy And Watch: See Updates To IBD Stock ListsStock Spotlight List Adds 8 For Your Best Stocks To Buy And WatchSquare Rival Testing Buy Zone After Biggest Acquisition Since eBay Spinoff

EBay plans to switch to Adyen in late 2020, though PayPal will remain a checkout option for eBay shoppers through July 2023.PayPal is trading just above its 50-day-moving average and is forming a new base.

""While the financial impact of the eBay transition remains tricky, this is primarily a (late) 2020 event, providing ample time for management to re-focus investors on growth and the potential benefits of capital allocation.""YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityWhich Stocks Make This List Of The Fastest-Growing Companies?Check Out These Tech Plays If You Like Amazon, Bitcoin, Netflix

31,EBAY,"Shares of PayPal Holdings (PYPL) climbed Wednesday as analysts said the company is gaining scale against such rivals as Square (SQ) with the help new acquisitions.PayPal late Thursday agreed to acquire Simility, a fraud prevention technology company, for $120 million in cash.

32,EBAY,"Holding through a stock's significant decline that could lead to a new potential base is a challenging prospect. Who wants to sit through a potential 15% or 20% drawdown for an indeterminate period of time with virtually nothing but a belief that the stock will head higher? Yet that is one way to make long-term outstanding gains with true leaders in a healthy stock market.Let's take a look at PayPal (PYPL), which had a big move from its first-stage base in late April 2017 until its sell-off in the first two weeks of February this year.The stock moved sharply above its first buy point — a shallow six-month cup with handle with a 43.90 entry — on April 24, 2017, just days ahead of the company's quarterly results. A strong first-quarter report sent the stock soaring more than 6% on April 27; volume surged 459% above its 50-day average.At least four aspects factor into a decision to hold a stock long-term.First and foremost is the stock's fundamental story. PayPal has become a household name; users ""venmo"" each other money. Venmo is a digital wallet that allows you to send money to friends or make purchases and has become one of PayPal's strongest-growing services.Second, check out the company's quarterly earnings and sales. PayPal has recently posted five quarters of accelerating earnings-per-share growth. Accelerating growth means that earnings showed a larger percentage gain in the latest quarter than in the prior quarter. At least two quarters of accelerating earnings growth is a bullish fundamental metric shared by many of the stock market's big winners. IBD Stock Checkup shows the number of quarters of accelerating EPS growth for every stock.Third, a nice profit cushion is a requisite for holding a stock. A flat base can correct up to 15% and still be proper. Meanwhile, the math off the top can be brutal. A 15% decline erases an almost 18% profit, so starting off with a greater than 20% gain is a solid idea.Finally, patience is the last necessary quality, and only when the market is in a solid uptrend. Letting a stock idea bake requires the ability to focus on the macro picture and not the daily price swings from high to low.Remember, weekly charts — found on IBD and MarketSmith — come first. It's easy to lose your way in the daily volatility of a stock's action, and the weekly chart smooths out that choppiness. A simple longer-term sell rule is the first significant close below the 10-week line (or the 50-day moving average on a daily chart). Leading stocks can go months, even years, without taking out that institutional support level.Even when PayPal built a 13.6%-deep flat base at the end of 2017, the 10-week line guided the stock higher. The new base featured a 79.48 buy point, 10 cents above the left-side high.In the week ended Feb. 2 this year, PayPal plunged through its 10-week line, closing down over 10% on the week in volume surging 105% above the 10-week average. It was the stock's first significant close below that level since the start of its move back in April, over nine months ago. On Feb. 6, PayPal fell more than 7% below the latest buy point, triggering a key loss-cutting sell rule. Driving the stock lower was news that its former parent, eBay (EBAY), would be ending their relationship by switching to a new digital payments provider.While that seems like a big giveback off the top, even selling at the Feb. 6 session low of 72.25 still captures a gain of at least 64% from the early cup-with-handle buy point of 43.90, while giving the stock room for an ever bigger move to the upside. You have to be willing to sacrifice a portion of your profit for greater potential upside, which underscores the importance of maintaining a lower-cost basis.It's great to have conviction, but only as long as the stock is going up. Remember, while buying a stock is primarily driven by its fundamentals, selling a stock is most definitively based on the chart. When it starts to trigger classic sell signals, it's time to listen to the stock and lock in hard-fought gains, especially when the market environment is falling apart.If the market regains its stride and the stock constructively builds a new base, you can always buy the stock back at a new risk-optimal buy point.(A version of this article was first published on Feb. 9, 2018.)Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.RELATED:Which Way Is The Stock Market Headed?

41,EBAY,"Major stock indexes turned lower in afternoon trading Tuesday, unable to hold early gains despite another tame reading in consumer inflation before the open.X Semiconductor names Micron Technology (MU), Broadcom (AVGO) and Intel (INTC) were early outperformers in the Nasdaq 100, but gains  faded for all three.

A nearly-7% intraday gain for Micron faded to less than 1% late Tuesday, while a 4% gain for Intel morphed to less than 0.5%.The Nasdaq composite fared the worst, falling 0.9%, but after seven straight gains, some consolidation isn't out of the ordinary.

PayPal (PYPL) fell modestly in early after-hours action, but then plunged late in the session,S&P 500 index futures were fractionally higher vs. fair value. Nasdaq 100 and Dow futures fell 0.1%.Keep in mind that extended trading does not always translate into how a stock will open or close in the followingvvv regular session. Volume will be much heavier, while analysts and investors will have more time to sift through the figures and comments.Facebook topped adjusted earnings and sales growth estimates, but shares sold off more than 4% in early after-hours trading after CEO Mark Zuckerberg said changes to its News Feed reduced users' time on the site by 50 million hours every day. Daily active users in the U.S. and Canada fell for the first time ever, falling to 184 million users from 185 million in Q3.But late in the post-earnings call with analysts, Facebook said ad rates have soared.

PayPal also gave largely in-line guidance for 2018. Shares initially fell modestly in late trade after rising to a record high during Wednesday's regular session. But then former parent eBay (EBAY), which also reported earnings after hours, said it would drop PayPal as its online payment provider for Dutch firm Adyen.

That offered further, implicit confirmation that Apple will cut guidance when it reports holiday-quarter results Thursday night.But Qorvo shot up 11.5% to 80 in late trade. That's after rising nearly 6% so far this week, retaking its 50-day and 200-day moving average. Admittedly, Qorvo's late-night gains likely reflect the company's hints that it will get a bigger share of chips in the iPhone.But Qorvo's recent action also suggests the bad news may be priced in, at least for iPhone chipmakers.Before Wednesday's open, Broadcom, another Apple chipmaker, reported preliminary sales that were above estimates, while also guiding high for current-quarter revenue. Shares rose 2.9% during the regular session, though they closed below their 200-day moving average.As for Apple itself, the tech titan's shares closed up 0.3% to 167.43.Apple is still down for 2018, trading well below its 50-day moving average and a 176.35 flat-base buy point. Worse, the relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, is holding at its worst levels since mid-June. Investors should be focusing on stocks that are truly leading the market.Qorvo and other suppliers and other measures suggest that Apple is seeing weaker iPhone X demand.

The Trump Administration's order blocking an attempted takeover of Qualcomm by Singapore based Broadcom (AVGO) sent Qualcomm sprawling and Broadcom down 0.5%. The news initially sent Intel (INTC) up 4%, but gains fizzled to 0.2% by the close. News reports Friday said Intel was considering a takeover of Broadcom, in order to avert the competitive threat of a Broadcom/Qualcomm combination.It is difficult to tell how prominent other events in Washington were in investors minds Tuesday. The White House's sudden, though not unexpected, replacement of Rex Tillerson with Mike Pompeo as Secretary of State, the break between GOP and Democrats in the House Intelligence Panel's release of findings in its Russia probe, and the Senate's progress toward Dodd-Frank banking oversight reforms may all have weighed on the stock market today.The result showed the Dow clearly stymied at its 50-day moving average, while the S&P 500 again met resistance at the 2800 level and the Nasdaq pulled back to test support at the level of its recent high, from Jan. 26.On the Dow, General Electric dived more than 4% after JPMorgan slashed its price target, with Microsoft (MSFT) and American Express (AXP) each booking losses of more than 2%.Among medical stocks, hospital operators Community Health System (CYH) and software developer Tabula Rasa Healthcare (TRHC) each skidded 7% lower.

Revenue of $4.86 billion, a 9% increase, topped forecasts for $4.815 billion.Payments volume for the quarter jumped 10%, with cross-border volume up 9% and processed transactions up 12%.CEO Alfred Kelly said in a statement that in the wake of President Trump's tax bill signed into law in December, the company was ""evaulating ways"" to invest more in its business in part to digitize payments.Visa also said it expects an effective tax rate of roughly 23%, with a six percentage point reduction due to the tax cuts, and it said the legislation would would add to EPS.But it kept its revenue growth outlook for the year to the ""high single digits"" on a nominal dollar basis.

Amazon reported earnings after Thursday's closing bell.But Nomura analyst Bill Carcache said the GOP's new tax legislation would create ""noise"" due to one-time impacts that the law — be it a benefit or a hit to earnings — will have on the credit-card companies' profit.Analysts generally expect the economy and finance industry to benefit from the GOP's new tax legislation once the sector digests write-downs, taxes on foreign earnings and other effects.American Express (AXP) — which issues credit cards directly, unlike card networks Visa and Mastercard — this month said it would suspend share buybacks for the first half of this year after a one-time, $2.6 billion charge related to the law chewed up a big part of its fourth-quarter profit.AmEx said it would halt repurchasing shares to gather up more capital after sustaining that charge, which stemmed largely from a repatriation tax on some foreign earnings and a lower value of deferred tax assets and liabilities. Companies can accumulate deferred tax assets during losses and use them to ease their tax burden.American Express stock crept up 0.25% on Thursday.

""Wabtec fits our quality, durable-growth philosophy based on the management team, their track record and a business with a strong operating margin averaging 17% over the last five years,"" client portfolio manager Kevin Lewis told IBD. ""Further, the company has sustainable growth opportunities in aftermarket sales, which are high margin, and also due to strong demand for active safety and improved emission products that they produce.""On news of its agreement to merge with the diesel locomotive business of Dow Jones industrials veteran General Electric (GE) in an $11 billion deal, Wabtec was full steam ahead on Monday, chugging forward nearly 4%. Shares retreated 1% on Tuesday. It lost about another 1% on Wednesday and was up Thursday morning. That left the stock ahead about 19% for this year. Wabtec shareholders will own 49.9% of the combined company. Lewis said, ""We believe the structure of the merger makes sense and view favorably that Wabtec management remains in control and is leading the merged company.""The fund's managers hope to hit similar jackpots with other holdings in leading stocks such as Netflix (NFLX), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Abiomed (ABMD). Those stocks have gained 73%, 35% and 106% respectively this year.Overall, the fund aims to invest in companies whose fundamentals are strong and getting better, but where growth is not fully reflected in their share prices.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseUltra Fund's success with that strategy is reflected in its 24.85% gain over the 12 months going into Wednesday. That outperformed 78% of its large-cap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc.Ultra is a bottom-up portfolio. It invests stock by stock. Buys and sells are not dictated by sectors or macro factors. Still, there are some broad themes that make some industries more likely ponds for the managers to reel in catches.One is the technology sector, where the managers see lots of growth stock stories. Information technology ended Q1 as the portfolio's largest overweight. ""We continue to find strong growth opportunities through bottom-up fundamental analysis,"" managers Keith Lee, Michael Li and Jeffrey Bourke told shareholders in their latest commentary. In the first quarter, the fund added to its stakes in Facebook (FB) and PayPal (PYPL).Netflix has IBD's highest-possible Composite Rating of 99. Stocks with a Composite Rating of 95 or higher are considered leaders. Netflix offers TV shows and movies to subscription customers via the internet.Netflix is the most-watched streaming service, viewed by 46% of respondents, up from 42% a year ago, according to a recent report by Morgan Stanley (MS). Original programming is the main draw for Netflix.Amazon Prime Video is the third most-watched streaming service. It now captures 30% of viewers polled by Morgan Stanley. That was up from 27% a year ago.Amazon's earnings per share were flat then grew 40% and 121% the most recent quarters. Trading around 1,584, shares are just above a 1,568.62 buy point.PayPal, a tech name to which the fund added, in November agreed to sell its U.S. consumer credit business to Synchrony Financial (SYF) for $5.8 billion. Last week, PayPal agreed to buy Sweden's iZettle for $2.2 billion. That would be its biggest acquisition since being spun off by eBay (EBAY).Potential new investors have balked at PayPal's high level of stock-based compensation, according to Morgan Stanley analyst James Faucette.Health care is another sector where the managers find a lot of growth stories. The fund's overweight in health care vs. its Russell 1000 Growth Index benchmark was its second largest overweight as of March 31.""Valuations of drug and medical supplies companies have corrected, and we see opportunity where earnings growth is driven by innovation,"" the managers said in their commentary. ""Despite potential measures to control drug pricing, drug pipelines are robust, with ample clinical trial readouts.""A maker of cardiac pumping devices, Abiomed is another stock with IBD's best-possible Composite Rating of 99. Trading around 390, shares are extended from a 304.38 buy point in a late-stage base.The stock ranks No. 1 in IBD's medical-products industry group. In turn, that group ranks a very strong No. 3 out of 197 groups. Leaders in strong industries get that way by showing superior earnings growth and sales. Abiomed got to the top of its industry group in part by growing earnings per share in four straight years and by posting a 44% three-year EPS growth rate.In addition to Abiomed, holdings include Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH).YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:Maximize Your Social Security Benefits: How To ApplyYou Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And Income

55,EBAY,"The Internet Association (IA), a lobbyist organization that includes Amazon, eBay, Facebook, Google, and other Silicon Valley big businesses, is pressuring U.S. senators to use Congress' authority under the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to undo the Federal Communications Commission's December 2017 approval of the Restoring Internet Freedom Order.X CRA, a bill signed into law by President Bill Clinton in 1996, allows Congress to serve as a check on rules issued by government agencies. To repeal an executive branch rule under CRA, a majority of lawmakers in both the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate must register their legislative disapproval within 60 days of a new rule's enactment.Although the Internet Association's wishes are unlikely to be fulfilled, the trade group's call for a return to heavy-handed bureaucratic tampering is hypocritical.In the letter sent to U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. R-Ky., and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., IA President Michael Beckerman wrote that FCC regulations prohibiting paid prioritization were needed to protect the little guy against big businesses, such as those IA represents.Use IBD's MarketSmith For Free Until March 11
"
56,EBAY,"See stocks near a buy point, get chart pattern recognition and run custom screens. Start Now""Americans rely on and deserve the lasting certainty of an open internet enshrined in the U.S. Code,"" Beckerman wrote. ""Strong net neutrality rules are necessitated by, among other factors, the lack of competition in the broadband service market.""""Net neutrality"" regulation is another name for former FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler's 2015 power grab, which sought to justify taking regulatory control of the internet using Title II of the Telecommunications Act of 1934. Wheeler's move unjustly — and possibly illegally — put five unelected government regulators between consumers and internet service providers.The fight over net neutrality was never about digital egalitarianism, despite what advocates say. As used by big government boosters, ""net neutrality"" is shorthand for ""increase the government's power over the internet.""A paid prioritization agreement is an agreement between a content provider or an edge provider and a network owner to allow the provider's data to travel on less-congested routes in exchange for an agreed-upon fee. When networks become clogged during high-traffic times, prioritization agreements allow consumers to receive requested data faster.All kinds of data travel over the internet, but some data types are more tolerant of delays or temporary congestion. Receiving the data bits in the wrong order or at the wrong time can cause distortions, stutters, and other playback problems, because the recipient has to wait for the bits to arrive and then spend processing power rearranging them.If they choose to do so, edge providers, including Netflix, would be allowed to pay ISPs a little bit extra to have their content bits delivered to consumers across the ISP's network faster than some other edge provider.Putting aside the obvious benefits of ensuring quicker, higher-quality data delivery for consumers, some of IA's members have a hypocritical past when it comes to paid prioritization. In 2010, Google and Verizon announced a set of guidelines for FCC internet governance that would have allowed ISPs to engage in paid prioritization. Leaving the door open to paid prioritization prompted Wired.com business reporter Ryan Singel to dub Google ""a carrier-humping, net neutrality surrender monkey.""Four years later, Google joined the fight for more government regulation, calling for Title II regulation for others, but apparently not itself.In 2016, Facebook began considering a zero-rating program for U.S. users after launching a similar program in India, yet Facebook's army of lobbyists leads the fight to prohibit paid prioritization and zero-rating. By treating some kinds of data differently than other kinds, zero-rating violates the big government principles for which IA fights.Netflix's net neutrality hypocrisy is also on display for anyone with a sense of history. In May 2017, Chief Executive Reed Hastings told Recode reporter Tony Room fighting for more regulations was ""not our primary battle at this point"" and ""not narrowly important to us.""Later, in September 2017, Netflix rolled out a special deal with T-Mobile, a mobile phone company serving as an ISP for many people, zero-rating streaming video for customers.Viewed another way, however, net neutrality supporters may not be as hypocritical as they seem at first blush. Despite individual flip-flops, supporters of this anti-consumer policy have always called for more government regulations, but only when it suits their interests.Big businesses and big government are often in a symbiotic relationship, as industries and bureaucrats conspire to increase the cost of regulatory compliance. Facebook, Google, Netflix, and most other big businesses ultimately care not about regulatory burdens, because they can afford the armies of lawyers needed to do the necessary paperwork.Reducing the cost and quantity of stifling, consumer-unfriendly regulations on the books, as FCC's Ajit Pai did in December 2017 and will hopefully continue to do, gets government out of the way, paving the way for improved services for the little guy about whom these tech behemoths claim to worry.You might also like...Net Neutrality Zealots Are Wrong — The Market Just Proved ItNet Neutrality Advocates Are Modern-Day Snake Oil SalesmenAjit Pai's Personal Hell, Our National Media's FailureClick here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

The effort also aims to stimulate faster user growth and lower the cost of traffic acquisition.The restructuring effort is needed as eBay faces competition not just from e-tail leader Amazon (AMZN) but also from the likes of fellow FANG stocks Facebook (FB) and Google-owner Alphabet (GOOGL).IBD'S TAKE: EBay is currently trading near its record high of 39.28 set on Oct. 10.

Millennials even were eager to attend the failed Fyre Festival in the Bahamas, where tickets ranged from $1,500 to $12,000 apiece.""Millennials want experiences and are prepared to pay for them,"" said John Tinker, an analyst at Gabelli.Live Nation is dominating the festival, promotion and management space — as well as ticketing, since its purchase of Ticketmaster in 2010. The Beverly Hills, Calif.-based company, which went public in 2005, said it sold 483.7 million tickets last year, up from 463.2 million in 2014.Live Nation makes it easy for concert goers to buy their tickets anywhere via app purchases.Those purchases may come via Facebook (FB) or from an advertisement on another website without having to go to the Ticketmaster page.The way to boost revenue then is to sell more tickets. Most concert tickets are still priced in the low-$80 range, affordable for most fans and music festivals are like splurging on a minivacation, with plenty of picture-taking opportunities for social media.Earlier this month, Live Nation announced a deal with Alphabet's (GOOGL) YouTube to offer concert tickets from Ticketmaster under YouTube videos of artists touring.Sponsoring events and festivals is a higher margin business. In 2014, Live Nation Entertainment bought a controlling stake in C3 Presents, the promoter for Lollapalooza, Austin City Limits, and other major festivals.""Millennials get in some festival (time) for several days and you get their attention. It really works,"" Gabelli's Tinker said.Live Nation offered a new Festival Passport for $799 this year to get general admission into any festival it sponsors for 1,000 lucky fans. General tickets for an event like Bonnaroo typically cost over $250 per person for the four-day festival.Live Nation also has its own venues like Jiffy Lube Live, a 25,000-seat amphitheater outside Washington, D.C., as well as the smaller House of Blues restaurants and bar venues.In its third-quarter report out Nov. 2, Live Nation reported a 12% jump in revenue to $3.56 billion, but earnings only rose 8.2% to 53 cents per share, under Wall Street estimates.For lesser-known acts it can be hard to sell out entire venues. But Live Nation isn't afraid to use Groupon (GRPN) and other discount sites to offload tickets.Live Nation also manages 350 artists from U2 to Nicki Minaj to Lady Gaga. Further, it has operations in 40 countries mostly in the U.S. and Western Europe and its website boasts that there is a Live Nation concert somewhere in the world every 20 minutes.""They bring scale, this is what they do, they manage 350 artists,"" Tinker said, noting that world tours for some superstar artists could be formidable for a smaller firm.""Can you imagine how difficult it would be to manage Jay Z and Beyonce?"" Tinker said.There isn't much room to grow in the U.S., but Live Nation has opportunities to expand internationally especially to Asia and Latin America, said Brandon Ross, a media analyst at BTIG.""There are a lot of dollars to be had in the rest of the world,"" Ross said.Foreign direct investment in China is difficult with high tax rates and competition from domestic firms. But major players in Latin America that are ripe takeover targets that would give Live Nation a strong foothold in the market, Ross said.IBD'S TAKE: Live Nation fell into sell range after the third-quarter report, then retook its 43.95 buy point on Nov. 6 before falling out again. Live Nation is part of IBD's Leisure-Services Group, which is led by Planet Fitness (PLNT), and includes hotels and cruise lines.""Most of the growth for them is going to be abroad,"" he said. ""It's much more difficult to go market by market abroad and roll that up, than it is to roll up your home country.""The vertical integration between the different business segments as well as its massive scale globally has made Live Nation nearly untouchable to rivals trying to enter the space in established markets.The failed Fyre Festival in the Bahamas in April serves as an example. Billed as a luxurious ""Coachella in the Bahamas,"" concertgoers shelled out thousands of dollars each, only to end up staying in humanitarian aid tents instead of the beach bungalows they were promised. It showed that not everyone can put on a concert or festival, but did prove that demand is strong.While the Fyre Festival was not sponsored by Live Nation, the company does encounter its own troubled events. It was a promoter for the Oct. 1 Mandalay Bay concert in Las Vegas in which a man armed with automatic weapons fired on the crowd, killing 58 and injuring more than 500. At least one lawsuit has been filed in which Live Nation has been named as a co-defendant. The company's shares have grown more volatile since the incident.Shares of Live Nation ticked up in afternoon trading Monday, and have been in buy range for most of November.Independent of that, the only outsider that has a chance to take on Live Nation is Silicon Valley behemoth Amazon (AMZN), which has upset everything from booksellers to cable companies to television studios.Ross said a company would need to come in and undermine Live Nation's vertical integration and if anyone could do that, it would be Amazon.Competition could also come from inside the ticket selling space. While Ticketmaster and Live Nation rules primary ticket sales, eBay's (EBAY) StubHub is the go-to site for secondary market sales and could pose a risk if it expands its primary ticket sales because of its brand equity, Ross said.But overall short-term risks are limited in the ticket and concert promoting space.""Tailwinds are at their back with more people that want to go to shows and more artists are touring,"" Ross said.RELATED:FANG Stocks News & Quotes: Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google

65,EBAY,"""Back To The Future"" foresaw an era of video phone calls and personal drones. Now another prediction from the movie series could soon become part of daily life: smart clothing that can self-adjust to its wearer's needs.While an auto-drying jacket like Marty McFly's is some way off, smart clothes are already here. They can heat up, cool down, change color or even size themselves. In fact, the U.S. team at the Winter Olympics in South Korea wore self-heating jackets made by Ralph Lauren (RL).Companies ranging from Nike (NKE) and Under Armour (UAA) to Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT) are developing smart clothing technology. As apparel makers hunt for tech know-how and tech nerds look for some fashion sense, the clothing trend is stitching together unlikely partners — and could reshape the apparel industry.A partnership between Alphabet's Google and Levi Strauss could be a sign of things to come. They have brought to market the $350 Commuter X, a denim jacket that lets the user control a phone through the use of gestures alone.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe coming years will see a variety of ""really wacky partnerships"" between fashion companies and tech specialists, said International Data Corp. analyst Ramon Llamas.""The first time you saw Google and Levi's you probably said to yourself, 'How did this happen?' "" he said in an interview. ""But over time it came to make sense and was a natural fit.""In addition to self-adjusting clothes, smart clothing includes internet-connected clothing. Juniper Research estimated last month that connected clothing is the fastest-growing segment of the wearable technology sector.For now, smartwatches like the Apple (AAPL) watch and activity trackers like the Fitbit (FIT) dominate the overall wearables market. Juniper sees shipments of those devices hitting 137 million this year, with compound annual growth over the next two years projected at 31% for smartwatches and 6% for activity trackers.Meanwhile, Juniper sees 102% compound annual growth in connected clothing, estimating it will be a $1 billion industry in 2020 with 7 million shipments. Just two years later, they will more than quadruple to 30 million shipments.Smart clothes also differ from today's wearables in that they will have longer ranges and more accuracy. They also won't be limited to a small touch point at the wrist.Developers are trying to keep smart clothes practical too. Google and Levi's Commuter X jacket is machine washable and can go in a tumble dryer. But a ""snap tag"" that contains tiny electronics and a battery must first come off.Google is developing a system that weaves technology into the very fabric of clothing as part of its Project Jacquard. Project leader Ivan Poupyrev says Google isn't planning to make its own apparel and instead aims to ""empower existing apparel makers.""Loup Ventures managing partner Doug Clinton believes successful synergies between tech and apparel companies will be a key to success. That will help the smart clothes market be worth several billion dollars in the next few years, he estimates.""I think we are going to see a lot of partnerships like that, and that's what is going to push the market forward,"" he said. ""This combination of design and technology is a really important part of the story.""Perhaps the most famous example of self-adjusting smart clothing on the market is Nike's HyperAdapt shoes, which boast ""Back To The Future""-inspired self-tying laces. Stars such as tennis champion Serena Williams and soccer icon Cristiano Ronaldo promoted the first edition. Initially priced at $720, the highly coveted shoes are being sold on the secondhand market for more than $2,000 per pair.A second version is in the works that will offer upgraded technology at more accessible prices. Nike's vice president for design and special projects, Tinker Hatfield, says the HyperAdapt 2.0 will be a performance basketball sneaker.""We don't really know when it's going to hit the market or be in the NBA, but it will be there for sure,"" he said last September.Microsoft has also explored the technological applications. Researchers previously unveiled a prototype smart scarf that users can heat up using a smartphone app.South Korean electronics giant Samsung has a myriad of offerings, including a golf shirt that can warn wearers of the weather conditions and a solar-powered bag that can charge cellphones.Meanwhile, Under Armour has brought to market shoes that track a runner's data through GPS. Shoes from the Under Armour Hovr line start at $110 and go as high as $140. The company also sells ""athletic recovery sleepwear,"" pajamas that beam infrared radiation onto the wearer's body to boost recovery.And Ralph Lauren looks to use the Winter Olympics publicity as a springboard to launch new smart clothes with smaller battery packs and controls linked to a mobile app. They could arrive on the market as early as this winter.If Ralph Lauren's self-heating jacket is any indication, the new offerings will feature crisscrossing partnerships. The Olympic jacket's conductive ink came from DowDuPont (DWDP). Precision printing company Butler Technologies applied the ink. Apparel maker 99Degrees attached the heating system to the lining. Design and engineering firm Key Tech made the battery pack. Principled Design's ConnexI/O e-textile connector interface linked the battery to the jacket. And Better Team USA made the jackets.That approach can be seen in New York-based Loomia, which started four years ago and makes flexible circuitry that can emit heat and/or light, as well as sense and track data.It has worked with companies such as Google, Singapore-based circuit maker Flex (FLEX), British retailer TopShop and apparel maker VF Corp. A key part of Loomia's business plan is that it is not manufacturing individual pieces of clothing. Instead, it is providing products to commercial partners, such as apparel makers, on a mass scale.Designer Julianna Bass collaborated with Loomia to develop a color-changing textile used in two dresses for her Spring/Summer18 collection. They were showcased on the catwalk at New York Fashion Week.Loomia has also solved one of the great challenges for the technology: creating e-textiles that are machine washable. While the details are secret intellectual property, Loomia's breakthrough comes from the way its textile circuitry is patterned and the fact the fabric itself is a circuit. The custom insulation adds further protection.Over the next year, heated jackets and boots with Loomia's technology will be coming to market. The materials are also seen as being useful for furniture.""There was a three-year process finding the core technology in our lab, finding domestic partners who would be willing to try these processes to scale in the production of these textile circuits, and working through growing pains with our suppliers and manufacturers,"" Loomia CEO Janett Liriano said. ""Now we're at the point where we are getting to market and selling these textile circuits B2B (business-to-business) to brands to integrate into their products.""For mass adoption to occur, consumers will have to overcome a few anxieties. For one, battery-powered clothes, like phones, will carry the risk of exploding. But given the ubiquity of smartphones, wearables, and other personal gadgets, consumers have shown they can live with that risk.Also, smart clothing will not be cheap. Ralph Lauren's self-heating jackets first went on sale for $2,500 and were later auctioned on eBay for $6,000. But consider that wildly successful Canada Goose (GOOS) sells parkas that aren't self-adjusting or laced with circuitry for $1,000.Google's Poupyrev believes smart clothing technology trends make ""ubiquitous connectivity"" an attractive feature for consumers, who might see connected clothing as a practical investment. And Loup's Clinton thinks that a decade from now smart apparel products will be ""almost the standard.""""Over the next few years it will be more experimental, getting consumers comfortable with the idea of having smart apparel,"" Clinton said. ""There's always a bridge where you have to integrate the consumer into the new world. But I think once people see the benefits of the clothes, the demand for them will be pretty significant.""A spokeswoman for Julianna Bass said their color-changing clothes were well received at New York Fashion Week. Demand is expected to grow going forward.""Color-changing offers the ability to extend the life of a garment and allows more flexible identifications,"" said Carolyn Thomas, a spokeswoman for the fashion house.But even before smart clothes catch on with consumers, the path to mass adoption may begin with industry.In the next five years, sectors like health care, pro sports, the military and emergency services like firefighting will adopt intelligent clothes, predicts scientist Pekka Tuomaala. He leads the Smart Clothes 2.0 project at the VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland. The scientist adds that companies have signaled particular interest in self-heating features.""We human beings tend to be lazy,"" he said. ""If our clothing would be able to help us we would most likely use such products and services.""IDC's Llamas also sees heavy industry putting connected clothes to use. For example, supervisors will be able to track the heart rate of workers and know if a break is necessary.The military is another obvious candidate for such technology. British defense giant BAE Systems has developed an alternative use for e-textiles. Its Broadsword Spine is a power and data network built into clothes using conductive fabrics instead of wires and cables.The technology allows electronic devices to be plugged straight into a vest, jacket or belt. Custom-built connectors hook directly into power and data sources via a USB port. It saves an estimated 40% of weight, a major benefit for infantrymen already loaded down with gear.Circling back to the world of Marty McFly and Doc Brown, Clinton believes the future is bright for smart clothes. He says future inventors will use both the science and the fiction of the past to inspire smart clothing designs.""I think a lot of our movies in the past got the future pretty right. Even with 'Back To The Future,' Nike released self-tying sneakers so that became a reality,"" Clinton said. ""In lots of ways fiction and entertainment inspire entrepreneurs to create the products they think are really cool when they see movies as kids.""As the next generation thinks about what they can build on top of these products, innovation will just compound.""YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Amazon Vs.

66,EBAY,"Shopify (SHOP), whose e-commerce software lives in the cloud, is now literally a play on getting high — well, on Canadians in Ontario getting high, to be precise. It's also a play on Tesla (TSLA) gear, the Los Angeles Lakers and Beer Nuts.X The reason: Shopify shares in the success of its customers. So the Ottawa-based company has an interest in its government's Ontario Cannabis Retail Corp., which just announced it will join Tesla, the Lakers and Beer Nuts, and more than 600,000 other merchants in 175 countries using Shopify's e-commerce platform.Even as the likes of Amazon.com (AMZN) and Walmart (WMT) wage a war over the future of retail — both online and off — Shopify's merchant customers are staking claim to a growing slice of e-commerce activity.Customers on the Shopify platform for at least a year saw sales rise 20% from a year ago, outstripping e-commerce growth as a whole. The National Retail Federation puts overall U.S. online retail sales growth at 11.5% in 2017 vs. 2016 during the holiday shopping season.""The more merchants sell, the more payments we facilitate, the more shipping we assist with, the more working capital we provide,"" Shopify Chief Executive Tobias Lutke said on a recent company earnings call.Collectively, Shopify merchants hit pay dirt this holiday season, grossing more than $1 billion in merchandise sales from Black Friday through Cyber Monday. Peak volume topped $1.14 million in sales per minute, twice the $556,000 apex from a year earlier. For the full fourth quarter, gross merchandise volume grew 65% from a year ago to $9.1 billion.Shopify's own revenue, which surged 71% from a year ago to $222.8 million, is growing even faster than that of its customers, for two big reasons.Shopify sprang up in 2006 to democratize the e-commerce opportunity by providing small businesses with a platform that allowed them to set up and manage their online businesses with the most cutting-edge technology at an accessible price. While that's still a huge part of its mission, Shopify has moved upstream to serve large enterprises, which account for a small but growing share of subscription revenue.Monthly fees for using the Shopify platform range from $29 for small entrepreneurs using the basic package, to upwards of $2,000 for Shopify Plus customers.The second driver is that Shopify has expanded its range of services and continues to sign up more of its existing customers for add-ons including payment services, financing and shipping.Revenue from those merchant solutions grew 74% from a year ago to $128.9 million in the fourth quarter, while subscription revenue grew 67% to $93.9 million.KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Monika Garg sees Shopify on track to hit $2 billion in revenue by 2021.Sales generated from merchant solutions should continue to outpace subscriptions during that time, rising to $1.3 billion and $719 million, respectively.One of Shopify's newer services, Shopify Capital, was launched in April 2016. It advanced $39.7 million cash to qualifying merchants in the fourth quarter vs. $14.7 million in the year-ago quarter.IBD'S TAKE: Shopify's Computer Software-Enterprise industry group is ranked No. 14 by IBD among 197 industry groups based on stock-price performance and momentum. Within the group, Shopify is ranked No. 11 by IBD Stock Checkup based on earnings, sales, margin and stock-price trends. Visit IBD Stock Checkup to see the leader in each category. Lutke has made clear that he plans to invest to aggressively go after what it sees as a massive, long-term opportunity, putting growth ahead of profit. Still, Shopify turned a profit in the third quarter and soundly beat estimates in the fourth quarter, earning an adjusted profit of 15 cents a share vs. estimates of a nickel, when it reported on Thursday.Shopify is ""well-positioned to be a 100-year company,"" Lutke said, because it solves the problem of giving small business ""a chance to survive and thrive.""Shopify told analysts on its Thursday earnings call that its 2018 focus will be pushing ahead with its international expansion and investing in its Plus platform catering to enterprise customers and enabling business-to-business commerce.Shares of Shopify weathered the recent correction, staying around buy range. Shares made a big 9% run-up prior to Thursday's earnings report and gave back 1.6% in afternoon trades Friday.International growth appears to be a prime opportunity judging from Shopify's acceleration in merchant customers in the fourth quarter. Shopify finished with 609,000 customers, up from 375,000 a year ago and 530,000 at the end of the third quarter.Both analysts and the company itself have difficulty nailing down just how big its market opportunity really is.KeyBanc's Garg told Investor's Business Daily that Amazon, which bowed out of its Webstore business providing small and midsize retailers with online shops in 2015, had more than 2 million merchants, which offers a hint of the running room ahead of Shopify.At the time, Amazon suggested Shopify as an alternative platform from which they could still have access to Amazon's sales channel and Amazon's payments system. For both Shopify and its customers, the set-up turned out to offer advantages.""Shopify wants to give their sellers access to every possible channel,"" Wedbush analyst Aaron Turner told IBD.In 2017, Shopify added Facebook's (FB) Instagram, global fashion search engine Lyst, BuzzFeed and eBay (EBAY) to its list of selling venues that its merchants can access without the complexity of multiple sites for tracking inventories and orders. It already had Facebook, Pinterest and Amazon in that camp.""Two years ago, less than half of our merchants were using more than one channel to sell. And this past quarter, that number is closer to 60%,"" Harley Finkelstein, Shopify's chief operating officer, said on Thursday's conference call.He highlighted the 61% of fourth-quarter transactions placed via mobile device, nearly twice industry-wide estimates, as evidence that ""Shopify is best positioned to help merchants meet these new consumer shopping habits and trends.""Analysts see Shopify as being on the cutting edge of technology, citing its in-app Augmented Reality feature, which the company built using the Apple (AAPL) ARKit for Magnolia Market, the home and lifestyle brand HGTV Fixer Upper hosts, allowing customers to see on their iPhones how items will look on display in their homes.Track Top Stocks And Market Trends With Free IBD NewslettersShopify won't just provide an e-commerce platform for Ontario's legalized cannabis business, it will provide in-store point-of-sale systems and credit card readers to process transactions at an initially planned 40 outlets.The cannabis deal might add $3 billion to the gross merchandise value processed via the Shopify platform. KeyBanc's Garg has estimated that Shopify's merchandise transactions will balloon to $87.5 billion in 2021, up from $26.3 billion last year.YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:The Big Picture: The Market Outlook Has Changed AgainChart-Reading Basics: How To Find The Correct Buy Point For Leading StocksBitcoin, Blockchain And Private Industry: You Ain't Seen Nothing YetWhy A Bull Market Rally Is The Time To Review Your Stock-Selling SmartsAI News: Artificial Intelligence Trends And Leading Stocks

67,EBAY,"Walmart is in advanced talks to acquire up to 20% of India e-commerce giant Flipkart for as much as $20 billion, according to Bloomberg, citing people familiar with the matter.X That would make America's largest brick-and-mortar retailer the top stakeholder in Flipkart, and position Walmart to take on Amazon.com (AMZN) and Alibaba (BABA) in the world's second most populous country.Friday's report follows recent headlines that Walmart was looking to acquire a minority stake in Flipkart. Reuters said the two retailers have been in on-and-off talks for the last two years.Walmart shares fell 0.65% in the stock market today after finding resistance at its 50-day moving average. Amazon slid 0.8%. Alibaba rose 1.7%.Just as Walmart is competing with Amazon in the U.S., so is Flipkart in a race to attract customers in India. Amazon and Flipkart both offered New Year's discounts last month of up to 80%, according to the Economic Times.

68,EBAY,"The S&P 500 index and other major averages had their first down week of 2018, and it was their worst showing in two years. Apple (AAPL) guided lower, as many suspected. Amazon (AMZN) and Boeing (BA) delivered strong results while Facebook (FB) touted strong ad rates. Alibaba (BABA) missed on earnings. PayPal (PYPL) crashed as former parent eBay (EBAY) moved to cut ties. A move by Amazon, JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) to team up to tackle health care costs hit insurers and pharmacy benefit managers. The Bitcoin meltdown continuedX After a hot start to 2018, the major averages suffered their worst weekly losses in two years, with the S&P 500 down 3.9%, the Dow 4.1% and the Nasdaq 3.5% as rising bond yields worldwide pressured stocks. UnitedHealth (UNH), CVS Health (CVS) and many other insurers fell on an Amazon-JPMorgan-Berkshire health care joint venture. Amazon, Boeing and Facebook were earnings winners, Alibaba was a notable loser, while Apple (AAPL) did OK.Bitcoin plummeted below $8,000 as 2018 losses accelerate as Facebook joined a chorus of regulators worldwide cracking down on cryptocurrencies.Apple (AAPL) earnings per share rose 16% year over year, on sales of $88.3 billion, up 13%, for the fiscal first quarter. Both narrowly beat expectations. Apple sold 77.3 million iPhones vs. the consensus for 80 million units, but average selling prices due to its new iPhone X and iPhone 8 models fueled overall results. For the March quarter, Apple expects sales of $61 billion, based on the midpoint of guidance, below official estimates for $65.4 billion. Shares fell 4.3% on Friday to a new three-month low.The e-commerce leader reported adjusted earnings of $3.75 a share, smashing the consensus of $1.85. A big benefit from tax cuts helped. Revenue rose 38% to $60.5 billion, also beating. Revenue from Amazon Web Services rose 46% to $5.1 billion. Sales of its Echo line of smart speakers far exceed expectations, Amazon (AMZN) said. Shares gained 3%, hitting a new high intraday.Facebook (FB) reported robust earnings and revenue growth that topped Q4 forecasts. User growth cooled while users' time spent on Facebook fell, even before its latest big News Feed changes. But executives said on the conference call that ad rates are soaring, easing analysts' revenue fears. Shares hit a record high Thursday.Alphabet (GOOGL) shares fell after the Google parent reported Q4 adjusted earnings were $9.70 a share, up 28% from a year earlier, missing views. Traffic acquisition costs, what Google pays partner websites to carry ads, soared 33% to $6.45 billion. Google expects the rise in TAC to moderate after Q1. Google's rising TAC has been linked to a contract renewal with Apple as well as internet searches shifting to mobile phones. Revenue rose 24% to $32.32 billion, topping consensus. The adjusted EPS excluded the impact of tax reform, which resulted in additional expense of $9.9 billion.Amazon's Jeff Bezos, JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon and Berkshire's Warren Buffett said the new nonprofit company is aimed at reducing costs for their employees. But if they are successful with their own firms, the thinking is that they would expand the services to corporate America. Health insurers and pharmacy benefit managers sold off. UnitedHealth, the largest U.S. health insurer and also a PBM, sank 6.7%. Drugstore-and-PBM CVS Health (CVS), which is buying insurer Aetna (AET), lost 6.8%. Pure-play PBM Express Scripts (ESRX) retreated 5.9%.PayPal (PYPL) reported strong earnings and in-line guidance, while former parent eBay (EBAY) reported in-line Q4 earnings but stronger-than-expected gross merchandise volume. But the real news was that eBay stunned Wall Street with the news that it will replace PayPal in 2020 and handle payments on its own site via a partnership with Adyen. The move will add a revenue stream. Shares of eBay soared nearly 14% on Thursday. PayPal lost 10.4% for the week, closing below a buy point and its 50-day line.The Chinese e-commerce giant's revenue soared 56% to $12.8 billion, the best gain in at least 15 quarters and beating views. Earnings per U.S. share climbed 25%, but slightly missed forecasts. Alibaba will buy a 33% stake in Ant Financial, a former unit that runs payments service Alipay. That replaces a deal in which Alibaba got 37.5% of Ant Financial's pretax profit. Alibaba will provide some intellectual property but not cash. The move clears hurdles for a possible Ant Financial IPO. Alibaba shares 8.7% for the week, tumbling below a recent buy point.The U.S. added 200,000 jobs in January, better than expected. Average hourly wages surged 2.9% vs. a year earlier, far above views and the best since 2009. The ISM manufacturing index continued to point to raid employment gains. While fast growth and wage gains are good news, they could spur the Federal Reserve to raise rates more aggressively this year.The software leader reported adjusted earnings per share of 96 cents, up 20% year over year, on sales of $28.9 billion, up 12%, for its fiscal second quarter. Analysts expected 86 cents and $28.4 billion. Microsoft got a lift from its cloud computing businesses, including Azure, Office 365 and Dynamics. For the current quarter, Microsoft guided to earnings per share of 83 cents on sales of $25.6 billion, above views. Shares hit a record high intraday Thursday.AMD (AMD), Broadcom (AVGO) and Qorvo (QRVO) offered investors positive financial news. AMD beat Wall Street's targets for the December quarter and guided estimates higher for the current quarter. Broadcom gave preliminary sales and earnings guidance for its fiscal first quarter that topped views. Qorvo rocketed after disclosing a big contract win with major customer Apple (AAPL) for its next-generation iPhone. Qorvo delivered better-than-expected results for its fiscal Q3, but guided well below Wall Street's targets for the current quarter.Boeing (BA) reported EPS of $4.80 a share, or $3.06 excluding a $1.74 per-share benefit from tax cuts. Either way, Boeing beat analyst views for $2.91. Revenue climbed 9% to $25.37 billion, also topping views. Boeing also guided 2018 EPS and revenue forecasts higher. Tax cuts will spur more investment and makes the case for new midmarket jet more compelling. Boeing also got a $6.6 billion missile defense contract from the Pentagon. UPS (UPS) ordered 14 new 747 jets, giving the venerable jumbo jet a new lifeline. Meanwhile, Lockheed Martin (LMT) EPS jumped 32% to $4.30 while revenue rose 10% to $15.1 billion. The defense giant guided 2018 EPS views higher.Boeing shares rose 1.7% this week and Lockheed 2.25%, both hitting new highs.Video game publisher Electronic Arts (EA) saw its stock surge to a record high after reporting big gains in online services associated with its sports game franchises FIFA and Madden NFL. The boost in Live Services was revealed as part of EA's in-line December-quarter earnings report. Video game hardware and software firm Nintendo (NTDOY) posted better-than-expected December-quarter results thanks to the continued success of its Switch console and related software. Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) announced a major delay to its highly anticipated Wild West action game ""Red Dead Redemption 2,"" now set for release on Oct. 26 instead of this spring.Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA) topped analyst forecasts, as people broke out the plastic more often to spend during the holidays. Visa also OK'd a $7.5 billion buyback. That follows American Express (AXP), which just suspended its buyback. Visa also hiked its quarterly cash dividend to 21 cents a share.Homebuilder stocks continued to struggle even as some big builders reported better-than-expected earnings after the prior week's surprise miss by NVR (NVR). Housing demand and prices are strong, but concerns are growing over rising labor and material costs. Mortgage rates, though low, are rising. America's largest homebuilder D.R.

78,EBAY,"Snapchat is for teenagers, Facebook (FB) is for your mom and Twitter (TWTR) is for folks who like the din of a public square.X But email remains the dominant form of business communication, and recent IPO SendGrid (SEND) is riding a wave of Uber receipts, Yelp (YELP) notifications and eBay (EBAY) marketing emails to profitability.The cloud-based email-service provider, which sprouted in 2009 after participating in the TechStars accelerator program, mostly specializes in something known as email API. Its servers send over a billion emails a day on behalf of its 58,000 customers, a list that includes Uber, Yelp, eBay, Spotify, Airbnb and Glassdoor.After pricing at 16 a share, SendGrid jumped 16.5% to 18 in its Nov. 15 debut. The stock was up nearly 7% in early trades Monday, near 25.74.In this day and age, email seems like a straightforward form of messaging, but as it turns out, a lot of them disappear into the ether. The industry average for email deliverability is only 80%, wrote William Blair analyst Bhavan Suri in a recent report, meaning that one in five emails never makes it to its destination. You might not mind so much if an ad whizzes by you, but refreshing your inbox for the arrival of a much-needed password reset or shipment confirmation is another matter.By contrast, SendGrid's delivery rate is 94%, which Suri — who initiated coverage of the stock with an outperform rating – says is ""a result of its strong sender reputation and close relationships with inbox service providers — enabling the company to effectively navigate sophisticated email filters and avoid emails being sent to spam.""For SendGrid's customers, ""the delivery of their emails to the inbox is not a 'nice to have,' it's a business-critical communication from their company to the user,"" Chief Executive Sameer Dholakia told Investor's Business Daily. ""And the difference between it getting there nearly all the time and it only getting there most of the time is the difference between acceptable and unacceptable.""Transactional email API drives about 80% of SendGrid's revenue, with the rest stemming from email marketing campaigns and other services. While the company would not disclose its largest clients by revenue, Dholakia said that no single customer accounts for more than 2% of total revenue.""Our top 10 customers constituted 10% or less of our total revenue in any period, so it's a highly de-risked and un-concentrated customer base, which is terrific,"" he said. ""I know not all companies that look like us enjoy that, but thankfully for us, we're fairly broad-based.""The company earned an adjusted $576,000 in the first six months of 2017 vs. an adjusted loss of $2.365 million during the prior-year period. For the year, analysts expect SendGrid to report a profit of 3 cents a share, according to Zacks Investment Research. But Wall Street sees a 4-cent loss in 2018 before the company returns to the black with a 2-cent gain the following year. Revenue was expected to rise 25% to $100 million in 2017, swelling to $136 million in 2018 and $170 million in 2019.IBD'S TAKE: Since going public Nov. 15, Sendgrid shares have generally climbed from their IPO at 16. Shares settled Friday at 23.97, a record close and up 50% from its IPO. But Sendgrid is not the top-ranked stock in its group. That designation belongs to Autohome (ATHM).SendGrid is in ""heavy investment mode,"" according to Morgan Stanley. William Blair's Suri expects public-company costs and investment expenses to weigh on operating margins and profitability in the near term, but says SendGrid's self-service model means that it doesn't need a big salesforce, translating to lower sales and marketing expenses.""Over the longer term, we believe SendGrid should be able to exceed its operating margin target of 25% given the efficient dynamics of its business model, which include high SaaS gross margins and below-average sales-and-marketing expense,"" wrote Suri on Dec. 11.Analysts put SendGrid's share of the very fragmented email API market at 1%-2%, competing against the likes of SparkPost and Amazon's Simple Email Service (more on that later). On its smaller marketing campaign front, MailChimp, Constant Contact (owned by Endurance International (EIGI)), Oracle (ORCL) and Salesforce.com (CRM) are rivals.""We see a fragmented competitive landscape of private players, positioning SendGrid as the go-to platform, which should allow the company to sustain a 20%+ revenue (compound annual growth rate) over the next 15 years,"" wrote Morgan Stanley analyst Stan Zlotsky. He initiated coverage with an equal weight rating and 23 price target, as he sees most of SendGrid's growth potential and margin expansion already priced in.Dholakia, who has been at the helm since 2014, sounds bullish about SendGrid's growth prospects and position in the industry.""There are many smaller competitors that compete with SendGrid that I think will find it increasingly difficult to compete with SendGrid, just given economies of scale,"" he said, indicating that management is keeping an eye open for possible acquisitions.The company has made two small buys so far, acquiring Message Bus' customer base in 2015 and bringing email marketing startup Bizzy into the fold earlier in 2017, the latter of which was ""a great technology and talent deal, more so than about revenue or business,"" said Dholakia. Bizzy should help beef up SendGrid's marketing campaign business.SendGrid also has a partner — and a rival — in Amazon (AMZN). The companies over the summer expanded their technology alliance, with SendGrid saying it is ""aggressively expanding (its) footprint with Amazon Web Services (AWS)."" But its offerings also compete with Amazon Simple Email Service (SES), which debuted in 2011 as a ""bare bones"" add-on to AWS, wrote Morgan Stanley's Zlotsky.Amazon's seemingly endless appetite can prompt nervousness, even in companies that don't compete directly with the e-commerce and cloud-computing behemoth. (After all, prior to its acquisition of Whole Foods Market, who would've thought Amazon was so interested in the grocery space?)But even though SendGrid's per-email prices are three to four times more expensive than Amazon SES, neither its chief executive nor analysts seem too concerned about the idea of Amazon unhinging its jaw and feasting on the email API sector.""We had a very candid conversation about the 'co-opetition' nature of that relationship,"" said Dholakia of the e-commerce titan, adding that Amazon is ""very used to having this conversation where they partner very closely with companies that they may compete with on any given service.""And Morgan Stanley's Zlotsky said talks with customers revealed that SendGrid's higher email deliverability, analytics and customer support took priority over pricing.

91,EBAY,"Plans by Amazon.com (AMZN) to make a line of smartphones is about its passage to India — in a battle to dominate the e-commerce market after having failed in China, says Edison Investment Research.The big dent in profits in Amazon's overseas operations, revealed in its first-quarter earnings report, is largely due to its determination not to lose India to Alibaba (BABA), as it did China, wrote Edison analyst Richard Windsor in a research brief Wednesday.""Alibaba wiped the floor with Amazon in China,"" Windsor wrote, ""and with developed markets maturing, Amazon's long-term growth is at least partially dependent on history not repeating itself in India.""Like China, India is heavily dependent on mobile devices and not fixed landlines. To win the e-commerce wars in India, says Windsor, Amazon's plan will be to offer good smartphones at low prices, with the hope they will be used for e-commerce transactions with Amazon.According to a report from India-based Gadgets 360, an affiliate of Indian TV station NDTV, Amazon is testing a new line of company-branded smartphones, known internally as ""Ice."" The smartphones would run the latest version of the Android operating system and include a variety of Google applications, such as Gmail and Google Play, making the phones fully compliant with the Google ecosystem by Alphabet (GOOGL). Amazon has not commented on the report.""The Ice device portfolio could serve as a way to encourage users to do their online shopping with Amazon rather than Flipkart,"" Windsor said.""Google has no e-commerce offering to speak of and so Amazon can produce Google ecosystem devices (which Indian users demand) and at the same time install its shopping apps, optimize them and set them by default,"" Windsor wrote.IBD'S TAKE: While Amazon faces increased competition overseas, the stock has been outperforming much of the market. Amazon, an IBD Leaderboard stock, has a strong IBD Composite Rating of 97 out of a possible 99. The stock hit a record high on Tuesday.Amazon stock was up 0.7% to 1,010.07 in the stock market today. Alphabet was up 0.5% to 1,001.59.Amazon's initial attempt at making smartphones, the Fire Phone, was a massive flop, attributable in part to high prices, gimmicky software and apps that users didn't want. Amazon quit the Fire Phone in 2015.The new line of phones would reportedly come with the latest Qualcomm (QCOM) Snapdragon processor and be priced under $100, said Gadgets 360, saying the information came from two sources familiar with the matter.""Hence, we can see Amazon selling Ice devices at 0% gross margins in order to win over more affluent Indian users to its shopping proposition at the expense of Flipkart & Co.,"" Windsor wrote.Flipkart is the e-commerce leader in India with a 35% market share, followed by Amazon at 23% and Snapdeal at 15%. Flipkart, founded by two former Amazon employees, recently received a $1.4 billion investment from Microsoft (MSFT), eBay (EBAY) and China's Tencent Holdings (TCEHY). Flipkart is reportedly in talks to acquire Snapdeal.""Softbank, the backer of Flipkart, is keen for it to merge with Snapdeal which, if perfectly executed, would give the combined entity 50% share,"" said Windsor.

93,EBAY,"The $13.7 billion Amazon (AMZN) acquisition of natural foods grocer Whole Foods Market (WFM) Friday stunned the market, clobbered grocery stocks, and spurred jokes and jibes in Twitterverse. One wag tweeted ""@jeffbezos this wasn't exactly the wealth redistribution we had in mind when you'd asked yesterday.""Bezos to Alexa: ""I need some groceries.""Alexa: ""I bought you Whole Foods.""🙃😋🍏🍎🍐🍊🍋🍕📈📊— Samppa Lahtinen (@SamppaSOS) June 16, 2017So where could Amazon go next? Here are five potential industries for the e-commerce giant.XAmazon already was said to be considering an entry into the pharmaceuticals market. While speculation had centered on online drug deliveries, Amazon also could conceivably add pharmacies to Whole Foods locations, several analysts noted Friday, creating further synergies between food and drugs and online orders and in-store purchases.If Amazon enters the field, it could send tremors across the pharmaceutical food chain, from drugstore chains such as Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) and CVS Health (CVS) to pharmacy benefit managers such as Express Scripts (ESRX) and distributors such as Amerisource Bergen (ABC).Amazon did have a finger in this pie once. It backed Drugstore.com before that online retail pharmacy was acquired by Walgreens, which then shut it down.Walgreens shares fell 5% and CVS Health 3.8%, though that reflected at least in part the immediate investor concern about the impact on their food sales. Express Scripts and Amerisource Bergen also were lower.Amazon Business, its B2B or business-to-business unit launched in 2015, sold over $1 billion worth of lab equipment, deep fryers and other gear sought by business owners in the first year of operations.If the division continues to grow at such a torrid pace, it could eat the lunch of W.W. Grainger (GWW), HD Supply (HDS) and other firms in the industrial supplies sector. That market is extremely fragmented, with some 5,000 estimated players and a value of about $75 billion per year. Amazon could disrupt it with a streamlined marketplace.While HD Supply fell 1% Friday, Grainger rose 2%.Meanwhile home improvement stores Home Depot (HD), Lowe's (LOW) and Floor & Decor (FND) have been Amazon-proof so far, but that may not always stay true.Amazon has automotive ambitions too. That is, it is rumored to want to move aggressively auto parts, carving out a slice of the $50 billion DIY aftermarket parts market.News that it is eyeing the auto-parts retail sector sent brick-and-mortar retailers such as AutoZone (AZO), O'Reilly Auto Parts (ORLY) and Advance Auto Parts (AAP) sharply lower in January. One report at that time said the online juggernaut already has contracts with Dorman Products (DORM) and other parts makers.Shares of auto-parts retailers are still mired near 52-week lows, with AutoZone 3.1%, O'Reilly Auto 1.1% and Advance Auto Parts 0.75% all falling Friday.Messaging service Slack Technologies targets the corporate chat room. That is said to make the Silicon Valley startup attractive to Amazon, which is a big player in the enterprise services market alongside Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL) and others.Having a messaging service could help win corporate business for Amazon Web Services. Microsoft and Google, which have their own cloud-computing businesses, have Slack-like messaging features.AWS has been key to the internet giant's streak of stellar earnings. In fact, Whole Foods could switch allegiance to Amazon Web Services from its current status as a Microsoft cloud customer given Friday's news.Slack is said to have a value of at least $9 billion, so it would be the biggest-ever acquisition for Amazon, surpassing Whole Foods.Amazon issued $1 billion in small loans in the past year to merchants on its online platform, Bloomberg reported June 7. It issues loans to sellers in the United States, United Kingdom and Japan and has plans to expand to key markets such as China.As its lending business gains momentum, Amazon could weigh on online lenders such as Lending Club (LC) as well as payment processors such as PayPal (PYPL) and Square (SQ), who also offer credit to users. Banks that lend heavily to small businesses could also take a hit.The lending program could also keep customers loyal to Amazon, which is seeing rivals such as eBay (EBAY) and Wal-Mart (WMT) step up their e-commerce strategy.Amazon's lending program, launched in 2011, allows it to profit both directly and indirectly — through interest rates and from more transaction fees as merchants grow sales.Shares of Amazon were rising 2.4% to 987.71 on the stock market today. Whole Foods rose 29.1% to 42.68, slightly above Amazon's 42 offer price.RELATED:What Amazon's Whole Foods Deal Means For RetailAmazon-Whole Foods Merger Could Be 'Category Killer' For Food, EateriesNew Flooring Retailer Manages To Sidestep The Amazon Squeeze

On the low side, Facebook's tax rate was expected to be 15%.Grubhub shares ended trading Friday up 0.4% to 71.74.Nowak's assessment does suggest that international tax provisions in the new law aren't entirely positive for corporate earnings. While the legislation adopts a territorial tax system, meaning firms will be taxed at the rate where their profits are earned, that longtime priority of multinationals has some exceptions.Companies will face a new 12% tax on profits generated by intellectual property held overseas. In addition, the law applies a new tax on payments between U.S.-based companies and another foreign unit of the same firm to discourage sweetheart deals that have the effect of shifting profits overseas and eroding the U.S. tax base.Trump signed $1.5 trillion in tax cuts into law on Friday, delivering a 21% corporate tax rate along with tax cuts for individuals, while killing off ObamaCare's mandate to buy insurance or pay a fine.The Dow Jones, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite, all up one-third or more since Trump's election, took a bit of a breather on Friday, slipping modestly.IBD'S TAKE: IBD Stock Checkup ranks Grubhub No. 4 in the Internet-Content group, based on earnings, revenue, margins and stock performance trends, and the industry group ranks 14th out of 197 industry groups. Grubhub hit a buy point of 57.71 on Oct. 25 and has since surged by 24%, far past the 5% chase zone.These provisions are aimed at changing the rules that have led Alphabet, Facebook, Apple and other technology and pharmaceutical companies to stash several trillion dollars in past profits overseas. Republicans held down the $1.5 trillion cost of the new law by applying a tax on those foreign-held profits of 15.5% on cash and 8% on illiquid assets, raising $339 billion over a decade.Nowak noted that Priceline Group (PCLN) and eBay (EBAY) have the biggest stashes of overseas cash relative to their market capitalizations and thus ""have the greatest ability to return capital to shareholders"" thanks to the tax legislation.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Artificial Intelligence Software To Grow Nearly 30 Times By 2025You'll Never Guess Who's Pivoting To Blockchain NowLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

As of Thursday's close, Amazon stock had shot up 34%, Facebook 32%, Netflix about 30% and Alphabet 24%.The same Goldman Sachs report pointed out that Apple and Microsoft (MSFT) have also driven the stock market higher. Apple stock fell 2.8% to 150.64 on Friday; Microsoft stock dropped 2.4% to 70.21.""Our view is that FAAMG — Facebook, Amazon.com, Apple, Microsoft and Alphabet — a group of five stocks, not four — have been the key drivers of both the (S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100) returns year-to date,"" Goldman Sachs analyst Robert Boroujerdi said in a note to clients.The Goldman Sachs report noted that the large-cap tech stocks have surged amid low volatility.""FAAMG, as well as tech more broadly, is increasingly correlated with both growth and momentum,"" Boroujerdi wrote. ""FAAMG stocks are cyclical growth stocks that have increasingly been treated like stable staples with a similarly negative correlation to interest rates and even lower realized volatility.""UBS analyst Julian Emanuel, meanwhile, also weighed in on the FAAMG stocks in a separate report.""Together as of (June 7) these 'High Fives' account for approximately 1/3 of the S&P 500's (year to date) gain,"" Emanuel wrote in his note.UBS' Emanuel said there is historical precedent for the FAAMG phenomenon: ""How unusual is this? Not very. Since 1993, there have been four years of comparable return 'clustering' in positive S&P 500 years — 1993, 1999, 2005 and 2007.""Emanuel says he understands if tech investors may start to get jittery and fear another bubble bursting, as in 2000.""Near term, it is highly unlikely that the current low level of tech stock volatility will persist, and investors can't be faulted for considering buying put protection or using stock replacement to protect gains, particularly in light of tech's recent outperformance against deeper cyclicals such as energy and financials,"" he wrote. ""However, growth in earnings, reasonable valuations and cash eligible for repatriation (Apple has more than 25% of market cap in offshore cash) are all reasons to expect tech to continue outperforming in the long term.""IBD'S TAKE: Google stock is well extended from a 874.52 buy point in a flat-base chart pattern. Amazon is on IBD's Leaderboard, which follows top stocks from their work on forming bases, through their breakouts, to their post-breakout action, up to the point where they start peaking.  The Goldman Sachs report also touched on chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA), whose stock has shot up 49% in 2017.Unlike the FAAMG stocks, Goldman's Boroujerdi says Netflix and Nvidia have more volatility.""While both Nvidia and Netflix have staged impressive rallies, neither name (at this point) is large enough to have a dramatic impact on the S&P 500,"" Boroujerdi said. ""In addition, realized volatility in both Netflix and Nvidia stands sharply above the FAAMG stocks as well as the broader market.""Citigroup in a report published on Thursday said Nvidia stock could hit 300 in a bull scenario that includes further gains in the data-center and automotive markets.Nvidia shares hit a record high, then reversed for a 6.5% loss.RELATED:Nvidia Stock Could Double In Bull Case; eBay, PayPal Hit Highs On AnalystsAmazon Stock Peaks Above 1,000 A Share; Alphabet Close BehindCBOE Volatility Index Hits Lowest Since 1993: Why You Should Worry

106,EBAY,"Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) offered a turbulent earnings report Tuesday as it announced that Chief Executive Meg Whitman will step down on Feb. 1 and forecast current quarter earnings that would fall below views — all amid a company restructuring.XThe company said Antonio Neri, who was named company president in June, will replace Whitman. For the January quarter, HPE forecast adjusted earnings of 22 cents a share at its midpoint of guidance vs. estimates of 28 cents.The result was that shares in the maker of servers, networking and data storage hardware fell 6% to 13.25 in after-hours trading on the stock market today.Whitman will remain on HPE's board of directors, the company said. Before running HPE, Whitman won kudos as the CEO of eBay (EBAY). Whitman had been in the running to be Uber's new CEO until the ride-sharing service named Expedia's (EXPE) Dara Khosrowshahi. Even before the Uber position opened up, there had been speculation that Whitman could leave in a few quarters.HPE is battling Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Dell Technologies (DVMT), which acquired data storage systems maker EMC last year, as corporate spending on information technology infrastructure slows down.IBD'S TAKE: Hewlett Packard Enterprise has done little to boost its shares since going public in November 2015. It engaged in a series of cup bases before working two flat bases, the second of which it's in now. HPE ranks 32nd among companies in IBD's Computer-Tech Services Group with Epam Systems (EPAM) at the top of the list. HPE reported fiscal fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of 31 cents a share, above estimates. Earnings fell 49% from a year ago. Revenue fell 37% to $7.8 billion but still beat expectations.A year earlier, HPE earned 61 cents a share on sales of $12.48 billion. Analysts expected HPE to report earnings of 28 cents on sales of $7.75 billion for the period ended Oct. 31.HPE in August completed the sale of its software business to U.K.-based Micro Focus International. HPE earlier spun off its enterprise services business, which merged with Computer Sciences to create DXC Technology (DXC).

111,EBAY,"President Trump has reportedly decided to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement. There was still no official word from the White House as of Wednesday afternoon, but such a move would be a big symbolic stiff-arm to global trading partners that may have negative implications for U.S. businesses.The potential intermediate-term consequences of an outright withdrawal from the Paris agreement are far from clear, although diplomats from a number of countries have raised the possibility of imposing a carbon tax on imports from the U.S. Still, any such economic measures seem unlikely in the near term, because few countries will want to rush a trade war and U.S. trading partners may want to coordinate their response, if any.Initial reports that Trump would scrap the agreement didn't dent the positive mood on Wall Street initially on the stock market today. But stocks lost ground as Bank of America (BAC) and Dow component JPMorgan Chase (JPM) said that low stock-market volatility would cut into second-quarter results and economic data pointed to slowing Chicago-area manufacturing activity. (Weaker oil prices also didn't help.)Trump previously made up his mind to notify Mexico and Canada of his intent to withdraw from Nafta, before reversing course. While another such reversal might be possible, Trump was set to meet with Paris pact supporter Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, a pullout from Nafta would have had destabilizing consequences for businesses and their supply chains. By comparison, the decision to exit the Paris deal may be no more than a public relations black eye.Still, many U.S. businesses, not least those in the alternative energy business like Tesla (TSLA), were hoping that Trump would backpedal from his campaign pledge to rip up the deal signed by President Obama.Tesla CEO Elon Musk warned Wednesday on Twitter that if Trump does withdraw from the Paris accord, he will leave two presidential business advisory councils.Even Exxon Mobil (XOM), Tillerson's former employer, had encouraged Trump to remain a party to the agreement, calling it an ""effective framework for addressing the risks of climate change."" Increased use of natural gas helped the U.S. slash carbon emissions and ""this success can be replicated globally,"" Exxon said.Exxon shareholders voted Wednesday to require disclosures of possible climate change risks for the company.Trump tweeted early on Wednesday that his decision would come over the next few days, adding in all-capital letters: ""MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!""Obama committed the U.S. to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at least 26% from 2005 levels by 2025, and contribute $3 billion to the United Nations-based Green Climate Fund to help poorer countries adopt green technologies. Only $1 billion has so far been delivered.If the U.S. backtracks on that contribution commitment, analysts have said that might curb sales opportunities for U.S. green technology companies in emerging markets. Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) CEO Ben van Beurden has suggested that U.S. companies could pay a price if Trump's action spurs an international public-relations backlash. ""The U.S. has a major crop of companies that deliver technologies that are going to be relevant in the energy transition, and one way or another they will also find themselves probably more disadvantaged than advantaged by the U.S. pulling out,"" Van Beurden told the Financial Times.Shell's Van Beurden also said that a withdrawal by the U.S. could make it a less attractive place for foreign direct investment, though he said that most long-term investments may come to fruition when Trump is no longer in the White House.Yet the nonbinding nature of the agreement and individual country commitments means that there's no negative direct economic consequence in staying involved. Measuring U.S. progress toward its goal will take years and the agreement doesn't have an enforcement mechanism for countries that backslide. There's also nothing prohibiting members from scaling back their greenhouse gas commitments.U.S. carbon dioxide emissions have fallen to their lowest levels in decades thanks to a fracking-fueled shift to natural gas from coal. Germany is struggling to cut its emissions as it eliminates nuclear power.Trump could also decide to stay a party to the agreement but re-examine the U.S. commitment, which the White House has suggested is unfair. Supporters of the framework say the idea is to establish trust and, over time, ramp up what initially appear to be fairly modest goals for major emerging market countries such as China. Critics of the agreement argue that it is unbalanced and that U.S. participation will drive up domestic energy costs and harm job creation. Trump has been a longtime critic of climate science's global warming consensus and has pledged to bring back coal mining jobs.Soon after Trump was elected, more than 350 companies signed a letter urging him not to abandon the Paris climate change agreement. ""Failure to build a low-carbon economy puts American prosperity at risk,"" the letter said.Among those companies signing it were household names like General Mills (GIS), Kellogg (K), DuPont (DD), eBay (EBAY), Starbucks (SBUX), Staples (SPLS), Nike (NKE) and Intel (INTC). DuPont, Nike and Intel are all Dow components, like Exxon Mobil.Still, Trump expressed an open mind toward the Paris agreement after entering the White House. Last week, Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted that he had spoken to Trump about the climate pact three weeks earlier and was ""cautiously optimistic of a positive decision.""Some advocates of the Paris agreement have questioned openly whether Trump leaving the agreement would be better than remaining a reluctant participant seeking to undermine the deal from within.RELATED:Trump To Cancel Obama Policies Aimed At Paris Climate PledgeSolar Stocks Plunge On Coal-Champion Trump's Surprise WinHere's Why Bank Stocks Are Breaking Key Support, Sinking Dow

112,EBAY,"EBay (EBAY) reported first-quarter earnings after the market close Wednesday that met revenue forecasts and beat on the bottom line, but the e-commerce giant gave full-year guidance that fell short of Wall Street estimates.The company reported revenue of $2.2 billion, matching the consensus estimate of same, up 4% year over year and up 7% on a neutral foreign-exchange basis, eBay said. It reported adjusted earnings that were up 2% to 49 cents, beating the consensus of 48 cents.After dropping 2.5% during after-hours trading to 33 in the stock market today, eBay stock rebounded to 34.33, up 0.4%, The stock hit a record high of 34.74 on April 5.EBay reported gross merchandise volume — the total value of goods sold on its platform — of $20.9 billion.

114,EBAY,"Key indexes remained near the breakeven point Thursday afternoon after the first set of top-tier banks Citigroup (C) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) reported decent third-quarter results, officially kicking off Q3 earnings season.XBoth Citi and JPMorgan fell in heavy turnover, but are not triggering any sell signals.Apple (AAPL), meanwhile, quietly retook its former buy point from a flat base at 156.75 while social media phenom Snap (SNAP) jumped sharply for a second straight session.Apple is trying to stretch its win streak to four sessions and got as high as 157.37. Investors with conviction or a big cushion of gains in the stock may purchase shares, but volume is largely absent. Another strategy would be to wait for the iPhone giant to climb back above the 50-day moving average, currently near 158, or wait even longer and see if it can form a new base.At 2:30 pm ET, The Nasdaq composite edged slightly lower after marking a new all-time high of 6613.50. The Nasdaq 100-tracking Powershares QQQ Trust ETF (QQQ), S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average were all virtually flat.Volume was running higher vs. the same time Wednesday on both main exchanges.Apple had rallied a little more than 5% after clearing its 11-week flat base on Aug. 2 following its best EPS growth in nearly a year. The pullback to below the 156.75 entry and drop below the 50-day moving average reflected a sobering of investors' minds after the company unveiled its iPhone 8 and X models.However, such drops back to a proper buy point are not unusual, even among big market winners. IBD has noted in the past that as many as four out of 10 true leaders will backtrack to or near the buy point in a proper base, shaking out weak holders, before resuming its rally.Plus, Apple did not trigger the golden rule of selling.Apple has gained more than 39% since its Jan. 6-9 breakout from a first-stage cup with handle. Investors who bought at that prime entry would be justified in taking gains, but those who wish to see if there is room to run may hold until the stock shows a devastating break of the 10-week moving average (as seen on an IBD weekly chart; the 10-week line is painted in red) in massive volume.That has yet to occur.As noted in an earlier Stock Market Today column on Wednesday, the iPhone, Apple Watch and iMac marketer is in the middle of a slow yet steady turnaround in its fundmentals. IBD research has pointed out that nearly one out of four of the best stock market winners in history were corporate turnaround situations.In such cases, the stock's recent price-and-volume action, RS Rating, relative strength line and changes in current quarterly numbers matter far more than conventional IBD measures of growth that look at longer time periods. For instance, IBD's EPS Rating looks at both annual profit performance over the past three to five years as well as those in the past few quarters.For this reason, IPOs tend to have weaker EPS Ratings, because they have a younger record of profits.Snap, however, did trigger the golden rule of investing after it tried to rally back following a fireworks-like debut on the NYSE and a spectacular 34% free-fall in two weeks' time in March. Those who tried to buy later that month broke a key IBD rule, which is to never buy a stock before its base fully forms.While the rebound from an 18.90 low on March 17 to as high as 24.40 six sessions later was impressive, Snap was still in basing mode. Those who bought on the way up were forced to cut their losses at 8% or less.Now, shares in the money-losing social media network are trying to fashion an authentic first-stage base following a 62% slide from its all-time high of 29.44.Snap has lost money every year since 2015 despite showing excellent top-line growth. Shares are rising amid bullish comments made by Credit Suisse. Morgan Stanley is Snap's chief investment banker.In the second quarter, Venice, Calif.-based Snap lost 16 cents a share even though revenue soared 153% to $181.7 million, a quarterly record. Snap showed gross margin of $29.5 million, or 16.2% of total revenue. However, Snap also marked an operating loss of $449 million as R&D costs rose 608%, sales and marketing expense jumped 270%, and general and administrative costs ran up 308%.Defense firms continue to rally amid an ongoing threat of military conflict between North Korea and the U.S. Lockheed Martin (LMT) rose 0.7% to 320.95 to mark its 10th straight gain. The F-35 fighter jet maker is up nearly 19% after rising past a 269.84 flat-base entry in mid-March.Lockheed's earnings per share have climbed 49%, 24%, 8% and 12% vs. year-ago levels over the past four quarters amid revenue increases of 15%, 19%, 7% and 10%.Are there other relatively young IPOs (going public in the past five years or later) that are making money and doing well in the market today? Sure.Square (SQ), Five Below (FIVE), Ollie's Bargain Outlet (OLLI), eBay spin-off PayPal (PYPL), YY (YY), Jupai (JP) and others are just some examples. Most of these inhabit the IBD 50. Watch for follow-on entry points or new bases to develop.On Thursday's economic news, weekly U.S. jobless claims fell to 243,000, below the Econoday forecast of 252,000 and 17,000 claims less than the prior week.Crude oil dropped hard after U.S. inventories slumped by 2.7 million barrels, a smaller drawdown than the 6 million barrel decline in the prior week. WTI futures on the NYMEX fell 1.4% to $50.56 a barrel. Gold jumped more than 0.6% and futures hit a session high of $1,299.80 a troy ounce.IBD'S TAKE: Did you know that the flat base, which reflects an unwillingness among large fund managers to dump their shares, often serves as a launchpad for big breakouts and tremendous price gains for many growth stocks?

While eBay's gross merchandise volume accelerated in the U.S. market, gross margin and the margins for adjusted earnings both fell short of his forecast.""We still cannot get to a compelling valuation to warrant a change in investment stance,"" Ju wrote.RELATED:Flipkart Gets $1.4 Billion, Upping Stakes For Battle With Amazon In India

119,EBAY,"Sure, Amazon made a splashy invasion of the retail grocery space when it bought Whole Foods Markets a few months ago, but the e-commerce giant's Chinese counterpart, Alibaba (BABA), has been in that realm for quite some time now.XIt was two years ago that Alibaba decided it could make further inroads into the consumer psyche when it decided to start its own supermarket chain called Hema. Now there are 18 Hemas — not quite the 400-plus Whole Foods outlets that Amazon (AMZN) gained in one fell swoop with its $13.7 billion deal. Still, Alibaba has known for some time there was a reason to break into that sector, analysts say.For one, users with a Hema supermarket app hook up to Alibaba's e-commerce platform and payment system. They can then shop for groceries online and have them delivered or pick them up. Or they can order fresh food and have it prepared by Hema chefs. And they can pay for any of it using the Alibaba online payment platform Alipay. The idea is to draw customers deeper into Alibaba's consumer-facing ecosystem.""Historically, supermarket food delivery has been a difficult, low-profit category from an e-commerce perspective,"" Morningstar analyst R.J. Hottovy told Investor's Business Daily. ""It doesn't make a ton of profit but the rationale is that it gets people to keep coming back to their online ecosystem, moving Alibaba from a customer acquisition phase to a customer engagement phase.""It's one reason why Alibaba stays vibrant and keeps growing even with revenue topping $23 billion a year and a market cap at more than $430 billion. The grocery business historically operates on the slimmest of margins, but Alibaba aims to make groceries just one part of its many businesses, interconnected via the digital economy, helping to ensure customer loyalty.Along with groceries, Alibaba has expanded into multiple facets of a digital economy, engaged in digital entertainment and movies, financial services and cloud computing, among other businesses.Alibaba also sees itself as a data company, having captured a significant amount of user data with more than half a billion people shopping on its platform that buy something at least once a month. That data has been used for, among other things, targeted advertising and product promotions. It also sells that data to help the sellers of products on Alibaba's e-commerce platforms better target buyers.As if all that wasn't enough, Alibaba also reportedly is working on its first brick-and-mortar mall, a five-story facility near company headquarters, scheduled to open in April, according to a report from China financial media outlet Caixin. The mall will exhibit a number of brands that are on Alibaba's e-commerce platform Taobao, as well as many conventional retail brands. It will also have a Hema grocery store.""We remain intrigued by Alibaba's 'new retail' platform and believe this offers the company another avenue of long-term growth,"" said Hottovy.If you don't know the story already, Alibaba was founded in 1999 in Hangzhou, China, but didn't gain widespread recognition until its blockbuster initial public offering in September 2014. It was the largest IPO ever on U.S. markets, raising $25 billion, with shares priced at 68. Alibaba stock this year is up about 93%. Shares ticked down slightly Friday to 170.25 in midday action.At the end of June, Alibaba said it had 466 million annual active customers and 529 million people visiting Alibaba sites via mobile devices.The company was launched by current Chairman Jack Ma and others, starting with an e-commerce platform for businesses. It then added another website for consumers and then several more. Alibaba emerged as the largest online shopping platform in China and accounts for about 75% of online transactions processed in that country, analysts estimate.""Over the past few quarters, we have constantly delivered superb results, and the market is gradually recognizing the significant value created by the Alibaba economy,"" Alibaba Chief Executive Daniel Zhang said during a conference call after the company reported earnings Aug. 17. ""We are committed more than ever to build a data-driven infrastructure for commerce in the area of the digital economy.""Alibaba's two core e-commerce platforms, which account for a majority of revenue, are Tmall and Taobao. Tmall is China's largest business-to-consumer platform, which retailers worldwide use to establish online stores. Taobao is China's largest consumer-to-consumer shopping site, similar to eBay (EBAY). Alibaba also operates on online wholesale marketplace, called 1688.com, among others.It also operates Cainiao Network, an affiliate that provides a logistics platform that links a network of delivery partners, warehouses and merchants to make package deliveries. Another growth area is its cloud-computing business, which has been growing revenue at a triple-digit rate.IBD'S TAKE: U.S.-listed China-based firms, particularly those catering to China's booming internet population, aren't suffering from lack of growth. Far from it, as names like Alibaba, JD.com, Baidu, Sina, Weibo and others continue to produce blockbuster earnings and sales. Alibaba is an IBD Leaderboard stock with a best-possible IBD Composite Rating of 99.Strength in e-commerce and contributions from its other business lines helped Alibaba beat the consensus estimate when it reported earnings in August. Revenue rose 56% from the year-ago quarter to $7.4 billion while adjusted earnings rose 60%.Revenue from Alibaba's nascent cloud computing business nearly doubled to $359 million, as paying cloud customers surged 75% to 1.01 million. Its e-commerce operation accounted for 86% of revenue. Digital media and entertainment accounted for 8%, while cloud computing added 5%.China lags behind the U.S. in cloud computing development by a wide margin but has plenty of opportunity to grow that business.""We see huge potential for China's public cloud market to catch up with the U.S., as the growing awareness of public clouds' benefits is driving a growing number of enterprises to adopt this service,"" said a report from DBS Group in July, when it initiated coverage on Alibaba with a buy rating and price target of 170.Several analysts raised their price target on Alibaba following the company's August earnings report, including Baird analyst Colin Sebastian. He raised his price target to 190 from 170.""Alibaba's scale, consumer data, and technological sophistication provides significant competitive advantages that will become even more pronounced going forward,"" Sebastian said in a note to clients.Alibaba's main competitor in the e-commerce field is China-based JD.com (JD), which has partnerships with Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) and Tencent Holdings (TCEHY). Tencent is China's leader in mobile messaging and gaming, along with China search engine leader Baidu (BIDU).But Alibaba is different from Amazon or JD.com in that it does not warehouse the inventory. Alibaba serves as an intermediary between buyers and sellers. Alibaba gets a cut from the sale of goods on its platforms, known as its monetization rate, which is about 2.5% of gross merchandise sold.""Alibaba is more like a marketplace and JD more like a retailer,"" said Morningstar's Hottovy. ""JD is doing some interesting things but at the end of the day, Alibaba is the most preferred market for online consumers.""Still, Alibaba wants to make further inroads. Currently, e-commerce accounts for about 15% of total retail sales in China. Alibaba sees its new strategy as a way to capture more of the other 85% of retail sales that occur offline and at stores.Earlier this year, Alibaba completed the acquisition of Intime Retail Group for $2.6 billion. Intime operates roughly 49 department stores and shopping malls in China""Our goal is not to simply ride a wave of converting purchases from offline to online,"" said Joe Tsai, Alibaba executive vice chairman, on the company's August earnings call. ""Our new retail strategy is an invention that anticipates and catalyzes changes in consumer behavior where time, place and method of purchase and consumption will be different from what we were used to before.""RELATED:Alibaba Price-Target Increase Comes As China Stocks Stay StrongChina Stocks Battered As Profit-Taking Kicks In After Long Run-UpWhat Amazon's Whole Foods Deal Means For RetailChinese Internet Giant Tencent Earnings Top, Revenue Soars 59%Is Amazon Closer To Fulfilling Dream Of Fast Grocery Delivery?

120,EBAY,"It may seem a bit far out — plans to send humans on a roughly seven-month, 34-million-mile ride to Mars, all for the privilege of standing where temperatures can get to 100 degrees below zero.XBut colonizing Mars is a central reason Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla (TSLA),  founded his rocket-ship company SpaceX 15 years ago. Musk, who spends equal time between Tesla and SpaceX, is one of four billionaires who are using their fortunes to fulfill a passion for space exploration and tourism.The four have attracted a fleet of venture capitalists, big corporations and other investors into a private-sector space race of sorts. They imagine a world where entrepreneurs can create business opportunities in space that include galaxies of small satellites controlling gadgets on the ground and initiatives to send humans on thrill rides to the moon, all outside the reach of government budget battles and a fickle voting public. Musk has said many times that the ultimate goal of SpaceX is to make Earth's population a space-faring society.SpaceX, based in Los Angeles County, already has taken a step into the heavens, ferrying supplies to the International Space Station. It's keeping an eye on further commercial exploration of the final frontier.""It's a fantastic time to be in the industry,"" said Carissa Bryce Christensen, founder of Bryce Space and Technology, a research and consulting firm for space and satellite industries.Startup space ventures have attracted more than $16.6 billion in investments since 2000, Christensen says. That money has funded 140 new companies, two-thirds of them in the last five years and most of them in the satellite business, she adds. Last year alone, $2.8 billion was pumped into 43 startup space ventures.""Musk changed the narrative, transforming the way people think and talk about space technology in a very inspirational way,"" Christensen said.Other billionaires doing business in the great beyond include Amazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos, who established Blue Origin 16 years ago to make rocket ships for space tourism and science missions. Bezos recently said he sells about $1 billion in Amazon stock a year to finance his Blue Origin rocket company.Microsoft (MSFT) co-founder Paul Allen has Stratolaunch Systems, which he co-founded to build the world's largest aircraft by wingspan, able to carry rockets to the edge of space to deliver small satellites into orbit. It has a partnership with Orbital ATK (OA).And Virgin Group founder Richard Branson is another space enthusiast. His company, Virgin Galactic, aims to be ready to launch its first passengers on thrill rides to suborbital space later this year. The cost per seat? $250,000. The spacecraft seats six with a two-person crew. Science missions are also planned.Musk, Bezos, Branson and Allen have brought back to life a U.S. space business that was demoralized by the retirement of the space shuttle fleet in 2011, Christensen says. Of the four, Musk has done the most to demonstrate an economic case for space, enticing previously reluctant venture capitalists to invest billions in the commercial transports outside the stratosphere.Musk founded SpaceX with $100 million of his own money, acquired from the sale of PayPal (PYPL), which he co-founded, to eBay (EBAY) for $1.4 billion. SpaceX now has a private-sector valuation of about $12 billion and holds multibillion-dollar contracts with NASA to resupply the International Space Station and deliver astronauts to and from the station. SpaceX also has extensive contracts to launch commercial satellites.Bezos' Blue Origin has made several test flights of its rocket, New Shepard, which is designed as a reusable spacecraft for space tourism that will fly passengers to the edge of space, about 62 miles high. It has made several successful launches but has not yet begun commercial operations.Blue Origin is building another rocket ship, called New Glenn, that it says will be taller and more powerful than the biggest rocket in development by SpaceX, the Falcon Heavy. The company's rockets are named after two of the original seven NASA Mercury astronauts, Alan Shepard and John Glenn.IBD'S TAKE: New products or services are part of the N in IBD's CAN SLIM investing system. New products or services are what ultimately generates stellar profitability. None of the four billionaire-founded space startups in this article trades publicly, but you can scroll our IBD 50 list of top stocks to discover other innovative companies. Bezos made billions from his creation of Amazon, which he has used to self-fund most of Blue Origin. He's pumped an estimated $1 billion in Blue Origin. In 2015, Google and Fidelity invested $1 billion in SpaceX.SpaceX initially fueled the jump in space activity by pushing down the cost of rocket launches. That put the ability to catch a ride to space well within the reach of entrepreneurs to create various commercial space operations.Phillip Spector, counsel at the Washington, D.C., office of Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy, says lowering the cost of space access was critical for commercial expansion. Before joining Milbank, Spector was executive vice president of business development and general counsel at Intelsat (I), one of the largest satellite operators worldwide.At Intelsat, ""The biggest issue we faced was around launch, the pricing for launch and availability. There were not enough suppliers,"" Spector said. ""The addition of competition from SpaceX was very welcome.""Investors have yet to benefit from this new wave of enthusiasm.Shares of many large space companies and government contractors have long traded on the public markets, including Boeing (BA), Lockheed Martin (LMT), Orbital ATK, Harris Corp. (HRS), ViaSat (VSAT) and Orbcomm (ORBC). Boeing and Lockheed Martin have a joint venture called the United Launch Alliance that provides spacecraft launch services and competes against SpaceX.But there has yet to be a high-profile IPO from the crop of startup companies now flooding the market. The company best positioned for a possible IPO is SpaceX, which would undoubtedly draw widespread attention. But SpaceX recently shot down rumors that a public stock offering was in the planning.""Musk has been clear about not wanting to take SpaceX public,"" said Spector. ""We're not seeing a rush to IPOs among space companies out here today. I don't see Bezos or Branson having the need to take their company public.""But that hasn't stopped the chunks of money flowing into the market.""The funding environment for startup companies is robust,"" said Spector.Startup companies have focused on a number of narrow business models. One is building and launching fleets of small satellites to circle the Earth in a low orbit.They're using the satellites to study agriculture trends, track ships, produce high-frequency weather reports and study water pollution patterns, among other things. There's also a big market in the making with the advent of what's called the Internet of Things, which includes machine-to-machine communication.""These startups are doing some truly innovative things, using off-the-shelf technology and getting near the performance of assets that were 10 times the cost,"" said Dara Panahy, a Milbank partner who represents clients in aerospace and communications. ""That is a real game-changer.""Then there are massive projects such as OneWeb, which plans to launch the first of 700 satellites next year to provide high-speed internet and other communication services. Partners in the OneWeb venture include Branson, Qualcomm (QCOM), SoftBank (SFTBY), Airbus (EADSY) and Coca-Cola (KO). Investors plowed $1.2 billion into OneWeb in 2016.""The market has matured and grown and, along with some of the other enabling technologies, that lowered barriers to getting into space,"" said Panahy. ""So now you have true venture-capital-funded startups and angel-funded startups that can now launch on maybe less than $100,000.""That compares with launches in the tens of millions and even hundreds of millions of dollars in some cases today.Among the space startups is Rocket Lab, which has developed a rocket from scratch that's designed for frequent launches to low Earth orbit. Rocket Lab had the first test of its rocket, called Electron, in May. It plans to conduct two more test flights in 2017 and launch customer payloads next year.At full production, Rocket Lab expects to launch more than 50 times a year. In comparison, last year saw 22 launches from the U.S. and 82 internationally, according to Rocket Lab.Acquisitions have helped draw venture capital. They're the primary way VCs get a return on investment. Fifteen space-related companies have been acquired for a total value of $3.2 billion since 2000, demonstrating a return on investment that venture capitalists want to see.Among the acquisitions, Europe-based satellite operator SES paid $703 million to buy the other half of a company called O3b it didn't already own. O3b is a big player in the small-satellite communication field.Another startup is Planet, a maker of small satellites, with about 100 now in orbit, some about the size of a shoe box. Planet, previously known as Planet Labs, can image the whole Earth every 24 hours, providing data that can be used to solve commercial, environmental and humanitarian challenges.RELATED: In Jeff Bezos-Elon Musk Space Race, Score One For Amazon's BezosSpaceX Rocket Explosion Comes At Worst Possible Time For MuskSpaceX Jumps Aboard Space Tourism With Planned Moon Flight For TwoBezos To Launch Blue Origin Rockets At Cape Canaveral

121,EBAY,"PayPal Holdings' (PYPL) relationship with former parent eBay (EBAY) bears watching, says Morgan Stanley, which upped its price target on the e-commerce stock but maintained an equal-weight rating.Analyst James Faucette on Tuesday bumped his price target on PayPal to 62 from 49. PayPal climbed 1.1% to close at 59.69 on the stock market today. Shares in PayPal are up 50% in 2017.Since it was spun off from eBay in 2015, PayPal has evolved from a payment button to a broad payments service provider, while expanding from online checkout to mobile payments.EBay's online marketplace still uses PayPal for processing payments. According to Faucette, eBay represented 22% of PayPal's 2016 revenue and ""likely a higher percentage of profit.""""PayPal's preferential relationship with eBay is scheduled to end in 2020, with eBay able to experiment with new payment structure from 2018. We think it is probably safe to assume that there will be some (earnings) drag as the end of that agreement approaches,"" Faucette said in a note to clients. ""However, for now, our assumption is that any changes would serve to slow pricing and margin expansion rather than causing measurable negative impact. However, a worse case than we currently build in is certainly a possibility and a key source of investor concern.""IBD'S TAKE: PayPal shares have remained well above their 50-day moving average since breaking out in April. The stock holds a highest-possible 99 Composite Rating from IBD and continues to surge. It's now the No. 1-ranked stock in its group.PayPal has shifted its strategy to give consumers more payment options at checkout, such as using credit cards. PayPal in 2016 announced online checkout deals with credit card firms Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA).  PayPal announced in June that consumers will be able to use their PayPal account for purchases across Apple (AAPL) platforms.""With nearly 100% revenue exposure to e-commerce, a big online acceptance lead and good exposure to cross-border consumer spending, (PayPal) has significant industry tailwinds,"" added Faucette.RELATED:BitAuto Earnings Cruise Past Estimates, Guidance StrongHow Google And Others Could Be Profit Machines For AppleComcast Could Partner With Altice To Acquire Charter, Says Citigroup

123,EBAY,"E-commerce company eBay (EBAY) should post at least slight gains in revenue and earnings when it reports first-quarter results after the market close on Wednesday.Analysts project eBay's revenue will reach $2.2 billion, up 5% year over year, and earnings of 48 cents a share, up 2%.Key factors to focus on, says a report from RBC Capital Markets, include eBay's gross merchandise volume number — the value of goods sold across its platform. RBC expects gross merchandise volume to total $20.7 billion globally and $8.8 billion in the U.S. market.""We believe eBay will continue to face increasingly powerful headwinds from competition with Amazon (AMZN), innovative startups (and) a series of vertical marketplaces"" as well as growing competition from Alphabet (GOOGL) and Facebook (FB), wrote RBC analyst Mark Mahaney, in a research note Tuesday.Mahaney maintained a sector perform rating on eBay and price target of 34.Ebay stock fell 1.2% to 34.02 in the stock market today.

Dow component IBM (IBM) tumbled 5% on its weak revenue, accounting for about half of the blue-chip index's slide. The S&P 500 index also gave up early gains to close down 0.2%, with financials and energy stocks sliding. The Nasdaq composite clung to a 0.2% rise.Crude oil futures edged higher after suffering their biggest one-day loss in six weeks.After the market close, e-commerce giant eBay topped Q1 views, but gave weak guidance for Q2 and the full year.

The wireless chip giant gave guidance that bracketed the consensus, but with the midpoint slightly below. Still, Qualcomm stock advanced 2%, but after falling to a nine-month low in Wednesday's regular session.Qualcomm's CEO reiterated that he expects his company to remain a major supplier to Apple.

Analysts expect a 2% EPS gain to 48 cents, with a 5% revenue rise to $2.21 billion. The big online retailer's stock closed Tuesday at 34.02.

EBay also has been finding support along its rising 10-week line.IBD'S TAKE: Applied Materials is one of two leading chip stocks that are at make-or-break technical levels. EBay results come about a week before first-quarter financials from faster-growing Amazon, which benefits from its booming Amazon Web Services unit. Amazon closed Tuesday at 903.78, barely in range from a follow-on four-weeks-tight buy point of 860.96. The 5% chase zone runs to 904.Finally, Lam Research will likely be on the move after reporting a 137% EPS gain on a 64% sales surge. Lam also gave bullish guidance for the current quarter.

It also has extensive contracts for the launching of commercial satellites.SpaceX in January 2015 was valued at $10 billion, based on a fundraising round that was led by Google owner Alphabet (GOOGL).The IPO market has been on the mend from a lengthy slowdown that turned around with the IPO of Snapchat operator Snap (SNAP) on March 2.

Total proceeds raised were $13.7 billion, up 365%.Musk founded SpaceX in 2002, using $100 million of his own cash, which he accumulated following the sale of PayPal (PYPL) to eBay (EBAY) for $1.4 billion. Musk was a PayPal co-founder. Musk is also an early investor and co-founder of Tesla, founded in 2003. Tesla is set to report first-quarter results after the market close Wednesday.Musk has been in a space race with Amazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos.

148,EBAY,"The battle for dominance in India's e-commerce market just got more intense, as Flipkart received a $1.4 billion investment from Microsoft (MSFT), eBay (EBAY) and China's Tencent Holdings (TCEHY).The move increases the pressure on Amazon (AMZN). Amazon, Flipkart and privately held Snapdeal are now the three largest e-commerce companies in India, but it's still anyone's game to win, Richard Windsor, an analyst at Edison Investment, wrote in a research note.The big if is whether e-commerce company Flipkart can close its $950 million offer to acquire rival Snapdeal. The biggest investor in Snapdeal is Japan giant Softbank (SFTBY). It holds a 33% stake in Snapdeal and is pushing to get other investors in the company to reach an agreement to sell.As it stands today, Windsor wrote, not one of the Indian e-commerce players has established itself as the go-to place to buy and sell goods, ""meaning that all parties are likely to be losing large amounts of money through aggressive competition.""If Flipkart can achieve its hoped-for acquisition of Snapdeal and hold onto all of its users, he wrote. ""then its share of monthly active users will reach 49%, more than double that of Amazon.""""This could give it just enough scale and momentum to become the go-to marketplace in India, making it extremely difficult for Amazon to compete,"" Windsor wrote. ""This is a big if and will require flawless integration, streamlining as well as customer service.""Amazon stock ended trading up 1.4%, near 907.04 on the stock market today.Flipkart, founded by two former Amazon employees, said the Microsoft-eBay-Tencent deal was the biggest investment in the company in its 10-year history. It values Flipkart at $11.6 billion.The Flipkart founders, Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal, called the investment ""a landmark deal"" that ""reaffirms our resolve to hasten the transformation of commerce in India through technology.""Windsor thinks Softbank is willing to take ""a substantial haircut on its investment"" as it has concluded that should Snapdeal remain independent, its investment could easily be worth nothing,"" Edison wrote.Amazon does not have a good track record in emerging markets, ""as its performance in China vs. Alibaba was dismal,"" Windsor wrote. The combination of Flipkart and Snapdeal has a chance ""but Amazon does seem to be determined not to repeat in India the mess it made in China.""IBD'S TAKE: While Amazon faces increased competition overseas the stock has been outperforming much of the market. Amazon, an IBD Leaderboard stock, has an IBD Composite Rating on 85, meaning the stock has been outperforming 85% of all stocks in the past six months. The stock hit a record high last week.Amazon has pledged to invest $5 billion in Amazon India, which it launched in 2013.Ebay on Monday, said its investment in Flipkart totaled $500 million. Ebay said it also sold its India operation to Flipkart for an undisclosed amount.The investment by Tencent will increase its battle against China e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA). Tencent and Alibaba are two of the largest internet companies in China. Tencent is a leader in instant messaging and gaming while Alibaba dominates in e-commerce. Both companies have been steadily encroaching on the other's turf.The investment by Microsoft follows a deal made in February where Flipkart, in a broad strategic partnership, said it would use Microsoft's Azure as its exclusive cloud computing platform.RELATED:Amazon Scores Touchdown, Wins NFL Streaming RightsAndroid Passes Windows As Top Internet Operating System

The Android Pay deal increases PayPal's reach in retail locations.Android Pay faces competition from Apple (AAPL). Google has yet to gain traction in mobile payments, but the PayPal deal could be a boost, analysts say.""Millions of people already use PayPal accounts to make online purchases, receive payments and send money to friends and family,"" said Google in a blog.

159,EBAY,"""Buy now"" with one click.Online shoppers know the payment tool well. It's a good example of how innovating in digital payments can take a company and its stock a long way. XJust ask founder Jeff Bezos at Amazon.com (AMZN), whose shares have approached the 1,100 mark.Other digital-payment players — think PayPal Holdings (PYPL), Square (SQ), and hot startup Stripe — also make it easier for merchants to nail down purchases, whether shoppers are on a PC, using a smartphone or in a store. PayPal and Square have shined in 2017, with their stocks climbing 50% and 92%, respectively, for the year vs. a gain of 10% for the S&P 500.Innovation in digital payments is making cash and checks go away and someday may even eliminate plastic credit cards. As technology evolves, a battle is raging to draw in merchants to payment ecosystems, along with billions of dollars in transaction fees.Payment processors are wooing merchants with new software-based sales tools and website services and, in some cases, cash loans to grow their businesses.""Anything a merchant can do to reduce the amount of friction in the transaction has an immediate effect on the top line, in terms of incremental sales, and the bottom line, in terms of lower transaction costs,"" said Thad Peterson, analyst at Aite Group.IBD'S TAKE: Keep an eye on credit card and payment-processing stocks, which have risen in weeks to rank 31st in price performance among 197 industry groups tracked by Investor's Business Daily. A leader in the group, PayPal's stock climbed to a record high after earnings. Use the IBD Stock Checkup to see how PayPal and other stocks stack up on crucial fundamental and technical measures.But competition is fierce in the crowded digital-payment industry, with well-funded startups challenging corporate giants from the credit card, e-commerce and consumer electronic fields. It's a tight-margin business, but huge.Online payment processors generally garner around 2.9% of a transaction value plus a 30-cent fee from merchants. They may pay partners, such as banks, to use their systems. ""It has to be a scale (volume) business to make it work,"" said Peterson.The good news is that e-commerce is booming. Global e-commerce sales will jump to $4 trillion by 2020, up from $2.35 trillion in 2017, accounting for nearly 15% of all retail spending worldwide, says research firm eMarketer.Competition is about to get even rougher.Amazon's U.S. patent for 1-Click technology, which stores payment and shipping information, expires in mid-September. When that happens, analysts say Visa (V), Mastercard (MA) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) are expected to jump in with their own versions of the technology, intensifying the battle for merchants. While the credit card networks offer their own speedy online payment systems, such as Visa Checkout, they still require a user name and password to complete a transaction, while 1-Click does not.Amazon grew into an e-commerce giant by leveraging its 1-Click technology, rolled out in 1997. Apple (AAPL) licensed 1-Click for its app store, paying Amazon for the friction-free payment option.Keep Up With Stocks Near A Buy Zone At IBDMore recently, Amazon has been using 1-Click to attract merchants to its payments platform. If online shoppers log in to their Amazon accounts at third-party websites, 1-Click speeds up the checkout process. Partners include luxury retailer Moda Operandi, Nine West and L'Occitane.Amazon in February announced that 33 million consumers are using its payments service at both its site and third-party sites, up from 23 million a year earlier. That still trails PayPal's 210 million active customer accounts worldwide. Amazon reported earnings late Thursday and fell far short on earnings views due to high expenses.As digital-payment rivals target merchants, they're tapping a new tool — loans. Banks have stepped back from lending to small businesses since the 2008 recession. But Amazon, Square and PayPal have expanded their lending. Shopify (SHOP), a provider of e-commerce platforms that uses Stripe technology, has jumped into the lending game, too.Amazon in early June said its lending to small businesses has topped $3 billion, including $1 billion in loans over the last 12 months. Some 20,000 small businesses have received loans ranging from $1,000 to $750,000. Amazon uses internal data to identify creditworthy clients.PayPal in May announced that it has issued more than $3 billion in loans to 115,000 businesses globally since 2013. Square's lending has topped $1.5 billion over three years.One weapon that Square has been able to wield is making credit-card readers that plug into mobile phones and tablets, such as Apple's iPad. That enables Square to drill down deeply into the small-business realm by targeting ""micro-merchants"" — very small entities that may not have accepted credit cards previously. A handyman, lunch-truck operator or masseuse might be among them.Square in March unveiled a new platform enabling its retail customers to process payments on custom websites, getting into competition with Stripe and PayPal. Jordan McKee, analyst at 451 Research, says payment processors aim to add higher-margin products.""Everyone wants to be a solutions provider,"" said McKee. ""The payments space is difficult. Margins are very slim. It's a game of scale. These companies are using payment processing as a linchpin to offer software-based services with higher margins that are sticky.""""Payments is a hard business to make money in. But if you can offer software with monthly fees and get recurring revenue then you build a bigger business,"" he added.What companies will find long-term success? It's hard to say, but here's a snapshot of new developments involving three big digital-payment players that illustrate the industry stakes, strategies and ambitions.The iPhone maker says Apple Pay, the mobile payments service rolled out in 2014, is on track to be accepted at 50% of U.S. retailers by year-end. ""It's a commendable milestone but pales in comparison to the ubiquity of Visa and MasterCard in physical stores and PayPal (online) acceptance,"" said Josh Beck, a Pacific Crest Securities analyst in a report. Loup Ventures says only 13% of Apple's 680 million iPhone users have activated Apple Pay.Apple launched its first large-scale marketing campaign targeting mainland China in late July, notes research firm Analysys Mason. Apple has lagged in gaining traction vs. local mobile payment incumbents, Alipay and WeChat.Looking to gain traction with millennials, Apple in June introduced a rival to PayPal's Venmo and Square Cash, both person-to-person payment systems. Consumers link a bank account to a smartphone app and send money to friends or family using an email address.While the money-transfer services are mostly free for consumers, PayPal and Apple see the apps as acquisition and engagement tools. PayPal also aims to get fees from merchants that accept the money transfers as payment.The San Francisco-based startup maintains it has no plans to go public, despite speculation that it could pull the trigger next year. Stripe's latest funding round in December gave it a whopping $9.2 billion valuation. In all, Stripe has raised $440 million.Investors include American Express (AXP) as well as Visa, which has placed multiple online- and mobile-shopping bets, also investing in Sweden's Klarna and Square.Stripe's software enables companies to accept and track online payments made via credit or debit cards as well as smartphone apps and cyber-currencies such as Bitcoin. Stripe's customers build its tools into their own apps and websites. The tools help businesses bypass complex relationships with banks and older payment providers.Stripe's technology lets companies focus on their products rather than back-end payment processing. Customers include Salesforce.com (CRM), Uber-rival Lyft and Target (TGT). Stripe's closest rivals are PayPal's Braintree unit and Dutch startup Adyen.""Braintree and Stripe are similar animals,"" said Aite's Peterson. ""They take the payment processing load off of a merchant along with the risk. Both of them need to find ways to add value, to broaden their platform.""Stripe on July 10 unveiled a partnership with Alipay, part of Alibaba Group (BABA), and WeChat, part of Tencent Holdings (TCEHY), two of China's biggest digital-payment services. The deal gives Stripe access to hundreds of millions of Chinese consumers.Amid worries over competition from Apple, Amazon, and Stripe, PayPal has nonetheless raised 2017 revenue guidance and its three-year revenue outlook. Since spun off from eBay in 2015, PayPal has evolved from a payment button to a broad payments service provider, while expanding from online checkout to mobile payments.PayPal in February said one-third of all its transactions are now mobile while three-fourths of the top 100 online retailers accept PayPal. PayPal has forged new alliances with Visa, Mastercard, Google and Facebook (FB).Apple has also warmed up to PayPal. PayPal announced in early July that consumers in North America, Australia, Israel and seven European nations will be able to use their PayPal accounts for purchases across Apple platforms, including the App Store, Apple Music and iTunes.A deal with Amazon remains elusive.""Convincing Amazon to accept PayPal seems unlikely given it already has its own payments-tender type, its own private-label card, and it recently added a staged-wallet feature for Prime members, which we see as a direct threat to PayPal,"" said Thomas McCrohan, a Mizuho Securities analyst in a June 27 report. Pacific Crest Securities says PayPal could be a takeover target of several companies, though nothing seems imminent.More In-Depth AnalysisSmart Ideas In Artificial Intelligence And Early Investing Hot SpotsHere's One More Thing Amazon Is KillingFast Food Makes Its Biggest Change Since The Drive-Thru

162,EBAY,"Buying so-called ""FANG"" stocks has been a winning strategy, says Barclays' new internet analyst, though he warns that Google and Facebook (FB) could be challenged in growing digital-advertising revenue through 2020.Ross Sandler, the Barclays analyst, initiated coverage late Tuesday on Amazon.com (AMZN) and eBay (EBAY) with overweight ratings. Sandler also started coverage of Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and Facebook at overweight.The closely watched, big-cap FANG stocks — Facebook, Amazon, video streamer Netflix (NFLX) and Google — have delivered for investors, says Sandler.""We think the appeal of FANG is not only its strong fundamentals, but also its unique ability for investors to size up/down positions quickly due to its larger market cap and liquidity,"" said Sandler. ""In 5 of the past 7 years, FANG has outperformed the non-FANG stocks in our universe on a market cap-weighted basis, and we expect that trend to continue with more power accruing to the largest names in the space of late from key technology trends and consolidation.""Facebook shares rose 0.6% in late afternoon trade on the stock market today, hitting a new all-time high. Alphabet climbed 1.2%, retaking its 50-day moving average after tumbling last week on YouTube ad concerns.

Netflix grew 1%, on track for an all-time closing high.Even so, Sandler says Google and Facebook will face hurdles.""In order for Facebook, Google and others to hit consensus figures for 2020, mobile advertising needs to add around $42 billion in aggregate in North America alone and get to the same size as the TV advertising market today,"" Sandler said in a report.""For Facebook and Google to hit consensus estimates from now until 2020, they need to take nearly 80% of every incremental dollar of mobile ad spend,"" he added.

163,EBAY,"Conviction is vital to the managers of Parnassus Fund (PARNX). Ian Sexsmith and Robert Klaber, along with lead portfolio manager Jerome Dodson, have guided the fund into the upper echelon of large-cap growth funds by taking big stakes in relatively few stocks.They take above-average bets on each stock, particularly in their top 10 holdings. So they better have done their homework and have high confidence that their picks will pan out. Top holdings as of Jan. 31 include Charles Schwab (SCHW) and Micron Technology (MU).The Parnassus approach is working fine.

Parnassus Fund was among the top five in growth and large cap.The $3.7 billion Parnassus Endeavor owns just 26 stocks, while its $950 million stablemate Parnassus Fund holds 36 stocks. The larger fund, which Dodson has managed alone since 2005, has 48% of its assets invested in its top 10 holdings. Parnassus, which has been around since 1984, has 38% embedded in the top 10.Many growth funds hold 50 to 100 stocks in smaller position, seeking to control volatility with greater diversification. Not Parnassus.""We are a high-conviction fund,"" Klaber said. ""We have high active share and are bottom-up stock pickers."" Active share is a measure of how much a portfolio's holdings differ from its benchmark index.Aside from its focused approach, another way the funds stand out is their mandate to invest in good corporate citizens. ""We have no exposure to the energy or utility sectors,"" Sexsmith said. ""We are looking for companies that are best-in-class from an environmental perspective, a social perspective and a governance perspective."" In addition, Parnassus Endeavor's holdings must offer outstanding workplaces.As a multicap fund, the Parnassus team has the flexibility to invest wherever it sees opportunity. ""It is a go-anywhere domestic stock fund,"" Klaber said. ""We have no market-cap restrictions, so it gives us a pretty broad playing field."" Though Parnassus does have more than Endeavor in small and midcaps, 29% vs. 25%, Parnassus still favors large caps with 64% of its assets. Meanwhile, large-cap-oriented Endeavor has 86% in big caps.Some funds aim to control risk by veering only so far from benchmark-index sector weightings. Parnassus' conviction-investing results in some heavy over- and underweighting in sectors. As of Jan. 31, Parnassus Fund had 23% in financials vs. the S&P 500's 16%. Parnassus Endeavor was close to the benchmark in tech with 18%, but had outsize bets of 38% in tech vs. 19%, and 31% in health care vs. 14%.Klaber notes that a long-term focus has been key to the fund's success. Both funds have turnover rates 42% or lower. ""We are a bit more contrarian than other Parnassus funds,"" he said. ""We're willing to accept a wider range of outcomes in the short term.""Indeed, a direct line between top holdings and current fund performance isn't always clear. Some of the two funds' recent top holdings show signs of struggling, including Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Allergan (AGN), off 33% and 14% from their 52-week highs.Parnassus screens all potential holdings for relevance. ""We are looking for companies that are becoming increasingly relevant for the products or services they offer,"" Klaber said. ""We want to own companies that are gaining share in their sector or industry. The focus on relevance helps us to avoid value traps."" In value traps, investors are attracted to a stock by its low valuations, but after investors buy, the stock fails to rise.Wide moats are a hallmark of portfolio holdings. ""We seek companies with sustainable competitive advantages,"" Klaber said. ""We feel that provides protection during down markets because there is stored value.""Another important consideration for Parnassus is efficient capital allocation by companies it invests in. ""We go back five years and analyze how management has allocated capital in the past,"" Klaber said. ""We then project how we think they will allocate capital in the future to understand whether they are good stewards of capital.""The Parnassus team creates a three-year forecast with base, bull and bear scenario analyses for potential new stock buys. ""We are looking for asymmetry,"" Klaber said. ""We want companies with moderate to low downside risk and significant upside. An asymmetric risk to reward ratio is a common feature across all of our holdings.""""Historically, the Endeavor Fund has had a tech bias,"" Klaber said. ""As of the end of last year, more than 40% of the fund was invested in tech.""As of the end of January, two sectors accounted for approximately half of the Parnassus Fund. ""From a sector perspective, one of the sectors we have been most overweight is financials,"" Sexsmith said. ""The pro-growth agenda of the new administration has been a tailwind for these firms.""Parnassus is weighted 22.9% in financial service stocks. It added Progressive (PGR) in the first-quarter of 2015. Endeavor also has a stake in the auto insurance company. Sexsmith sees the company's online sales strategy as a disruptive force. ""There aren't many companies that are going to gain market share for as long as we can see,"" he said. ""When we see opportunities like that we are going to invest in them. Every year, Progressive chips away and gains market share. Its market share now is around 9% of the U.S. auto insurance market. That's going to keep going up over time.""Progressive shares have gained 11.4% since the beginning of the year and 19.1% from a year ago.Parnassus is weighted 27.3 in technology. ""In technology, we own a collection of wide-moat businesses with strong growth profiles that trade at attractive valuations,"" Klaber said.Klaber cites eBay (EBAY) as a prime example of a company with a wide moat. It is owned by both Parnassus and Endeavor. ""The source of its moat is a strong network effect where more sellers bring more buyers and vice versa,"" he said.Shares of eBay are up 12% year-to-date and 37.9% over the past year. They broke out of a cup-with-handle base in February, ran up 4%, but have since eased to near the breakout point.IBM (IBM) is a top tech holding in both portfolios. ""It is trading at 13 times earnings, about a 25% discount to the market, with a 3% dividend yield, so expectations are low,"" Klaber said. ""We think its server business will do better than expectations and its strategic initiatives group will continue to see growth accelerate.""IBM has climbed 7.1% so far this year and 24.9% over the last 52 weeks.The Parnassus team sees a lengthy runway for Allergan. The pharmaceutical company is the top holding of Parnassus and a top five holding of Endeavor. ""It has a dominant position in many therapeutic areas,"" Klaber said. ""It's a stock we have owned as a firm since the end of 2013, when it was in the high 80s. We were also buying it aggressively toward the end of last year. This is a company that has six drugs either in phase three or entering phase three in 2017.""Allergan shares have jumped 14.8% in 2017.The Parnassus crew exhibit the kind of patience with Allergan that many growth investors do not. While the company's earnings have grown at a 24% annual rate the past three years, Wall Street analysts see growth slowing to 19% this year and 11% next year. The stock's Relative Price Strength Rating from IBD is just 50.RELATED:Contrarian Pin Oak Equity Rises To The Top

164,EBAY,"ServiceNow (NOW) announced Chief Executive Frank Slootman will step down as of April 3, to be replaced by John Donahoe, chairman of PayPal (PYPL) and a former CEO of eBay (EBAY).Slootman will continue to serve as the chairman of ServiceNow's board.ServiceNow stock fell 4.4% to 87.75 in the stock market today, still up more than 15% in 2017 but down 7% from its all-time high of 93.97 set on Feb. 15.Donahoe was president and CEO of eBay from 2008 to 2015. EBay spun off PayPal in 2014.IBD'S TAKE: Broadcom, Western Alliance Bancorp and Primerica are on IBD's Leaderboard, which follows top stocks from their work on forming bases, through their breakouts, to their post-breakout action, up to the point where they start topping.Analysts were surprised by Slootman stepping down amid intensified competition with Salesforce.com (CRM).""We are not thrilled to see Mr. Slootman moving to the chairman role,"" said Keith Bachman, a BMO Capital Markets analyst, in a research report. ""In our view, Slootman has been the key architect, or at least a key architect, in ServiceNow's strategy of moving into new good growth opportunities beyond ITSM.""Founded in 2004, ServiceNow developed software for information technology service management (ITSM), basically IT help desk tools for tracking internal company issues. ServiceNow has expanded into new markets such as human resources, customer service management and security.Slootman has been ServiceNow's CEO since 2011. He earlier headed Data Domain, which was sold to data storage networking giant EMC in 2009.ServiceNow's 2016 sales boomed 38% to $1.4 billion. ServiceNow has forecast 2017 revenue growth of 32% to $1.835 billion at the midpoint of its guidance.""While we expected Slootman would not remain CEO forever, we expected more signs of succession process before an announcement like this,"" said Walter Pritchard, a Citigroup analyst, in a report. ""We believe the company had looked at bringing in an apprentice like successor, they opted to go with an exec (Donahoe) that has managed a $20 billion business.""Santa Clara, Calif.-based ServiceNow has set a goal of $4 billion in revenue by 2020.""Software CEOs have a history of handing off the job at 'the top,'"" added Pritchard. ""We expect near-term investor sentiment will reflect concern around this, even though there are no obvious signs of peaking momentum.""ServiceNow has prospered by taking away the customers of BMC Software, Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), CA Technologies (CA) and others.""As with any new leadership, we believe that there could be some turnover within the senior management layer as Mr. Donahoe looks to build out his team,"" said Mizuho Securities in a report.RELATED:Meet The 'Fastest-Growing' $1 Billion Enterprise Software FirmWill Microsoft Stymie Salesforce.com's Stock Turnaround?

""While we expect PayPal to be the ultimate acquirer given its significant funding advantage, we wouldn't completely count out Global Payments (GPN) or someone out of left field (like Google-owned Alphabet (GOOGL) or Amazon.com (AMZN)).""Vantiv on July 5 agreed to buy British payment processing company Worldpay Group in a stock-and-cash deal worth about $10 billion. That deal has sparked more merger speculation. French payments specialist Ingenico last week agreed to buy Stockholm-based rival Bambora from Nordic Capital for $1.5 billion.""We think the deal that makes the most sense would be (Fidelity) acquiring Total System Services given the significant potential accretion coupled with the undeniable strategic and cultural fit,"" said Davis in the report. ""We believe strategically it is a home run as it would give (Fidelity) significant scale in issuer credit processing as well as afford the company entrance into the faster growing, higher multiple merchant acquiring business.""IBD'S TAKE: PayPal stock is up 48% in 2017 and is extended following the run-up.

Higher costs hurt the carrier's estimate-missing Q2 results and were seen by some analysts as holding back margin growth in Q3. Delta indicated that the worst of its unit-cost troubles are behind it. Delta also touted its efforts to divide up the flight cabin into different fare classes with different amenities, saying that could drive profits. Management added that the addition of larger jets would allow them to offer more premium services. Delta shares fell 1.8% on Thursday but was down just 0.6%.

Ulta was not named as a discounter but the report perhaps flustered investor confidence in the beauty space. Ulta fell 5.5% for the week. High-end cosmetics maker Estee Lauder (EL) dipped but recovered by week's end.

Total program costs are seen rising nearly 2% to $1.53 trillion.

174,EBAY,"E-commerce powerhouse eBay (EBAY) reported fourth-quarter earnings after the close Wednesday that met Wall Street expectations on the top and bottom lines for the key holiday shopping season, and shares jumped after hours.Many reports state the eBay archrival Amazon.com (AMZN) had a sparkling holiday season. Amazon, the e-tail king, is slated to post its Q4 earnings after the close Feb. 2. Amazon has long outpaced eBay on growth, while eBay also faces increasing competition from two other internet giants, Facebook (FB) and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google.Some analysts had said eBay also looks like it did well during the holidays, though its growth remains solidly in the single digits. The company, though, posted its biggest growth in earnings per share minus items since Q1 2015, though sales growth slowed from the two preceding quarters.""During the holiday season, eBay was one of the top consumer shopping destinations in the world and the second-most-visited e-commerce site in the U.S.,"" eBay CEO Devin Wenig said in the company's earnings release.This month, the company announced eBay Authenticate, a program the company says will utilize a network of professional authenticators to to ensure customers they are getting what they expect.

175,EBAY,"The major indexes were practically flat in afternoon trading Monday, but infrastructure stocks rose after President Trump voiced new support for big spending.The Nasdaq and S&P 500 were up a fraction. Volume was tracking lower on the NYSE and higher on the Nasdaq compared with the same time Friday.The Dow Jones industrial average also edged up. The Dow would be lower if it weren't for Caterpillar's (CAT) 2% gain. The heavy-equipment maker rose along with steel and other infrastructure-related stocks after Trump said there's a big need to improve roads, bridges and other public works.Metal, biotech, oil and building industry groups were leading the market today. Some construction supply stocks, in particular wallboard manufacturers, rose in heavy trading.Eagle Materials (EXP) climbed nearly 3% as the stock found support at the 50-day moving average. Shares broke out past a 103.26 buy point on the Jan. 24 earnings announcement. But the stock then went sideways and now looks to reinvigorate its advance.USG Corp. (USG) rose more than 2% and is nearly out of buy range from a 32.03 buy point. Three previous breakouts for the wallboard maker met with limited success, so the latest one (on Feb. 10) has been the most productive since a breakout in January 2014, which resulted in a 24% gain.Earnings from Installed Building Products (IBP) may have pushed the housing-construction stocks higher.The stock broke out of a base-on-base pattern, clearing a 44.40 buy point in heavy volume.

176,EBAY,"The broad stock market outpaced JPMorgan Large Cap Growth Fund (SEEGX) in three of 2016's four quarters. But the market has turned into a brisk tailwind for the fund this year. That's a boon for investors holding the fund in retirement accounts and other portfolios.The $12.5 billion fund's 9.07% advance year-to-date going into Friday topped 87% of its large-cap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Inc. Its direct rivals averaged only 7.52%.That recent run contrasts with the past 12 months, when the fund's still-enviable 21.40% gain lagged 55% of its peers.The fund's recent spring got a boost from chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO), an IBD Leaderboard stock and part of the IBD 50. The stock is up 19% so far this year.IBD'S TAKE: Despite reversing lower Thursday, Broadcom is generally acting well after clearing a 208.85 three-weeks-tight entry Feb. 17. Shares have notched a 20% profit since their initial breakout. Many stocks pull back or start a new base after this level, so investors may want to consider locking-in some profits, as IBD's Leaderboard notes. Investors with more conviction may decide to hold for further gains before taking profits.The fund also got a lift from electric carmaker Tesla (TSLA), a smaller holding that is up 20% this year. On Wednesday, Tesla said its aggressive production plan for its mass-market Model 3 sedan was still on track. But the car- and battery maker reported a fourth-quarter loss of 69 cents per share, which was more than the 42-cent loss expected by analysts. Earnings per share rose 88%, beating the consensus estimate.Tesla also released information about development of its battery factories.Tesla shares' fall on Wednesday and Thursday triggered the stock's move from IBD's Leaderboard to the Cut List. The pullback left shares well below an alternative buy point of 269.44 and mildly below a regular 258.57 entry.Facebook (FB), a top-10 holding as of Jan. 31 and part of the IBD 50, was another top performer for the fund. The social media giant, which the fund has been trimming in recent disclosures, is up 18% this year.Facebook is ranked No. 4 in IBD's Internet-Content industry group. It has a good 89 Composite Rating from IBD. And its annual pretax margin is 60%.Amazon (AMZN), another top-10 holding, is up 14% so far this year.The online retailer and provider of cloud services sports a so-so 78 IBD Comp Rating, but that has not prevented mutual funds from boosting their stakes as a group for eight quarters in a row. The estimated earnings per share growth this year for the company is a solid 48%.Among other holdings, five of seven top new buys as of Dec. 31 had Comp Ratings in the 80s or 90s.Those included UnitedHealth Group (UNH), Southwest Airlines (LUV), MercadoLibra (MELI), Morgan Stanley (MS) and FedEx (FDX). UnitedHealth and FedEx are forming basing patterns. The others are extended from recent buy areas.UnitedHealth, a health care insurer and benefits provider, has posted EPS growth of 17%, 13% 23% and 51% the past four frames. It is ranked No. 2 in IBD's Medical-Managed Care industry group, thanks in part to four straight years of annual EPS growth.Southwest has seen two quarters in a row of declining EPS, with another decline expected for the current quarter. Still, its three-year average annual EPS growth rate is 56%. And its annual EPS have grown for five straight years.Argentine-based MercadoLibra is Latin America's No. 1 e-commerce company. It is often referred to as the eBay (EBAY) of Latin America. It is ranked No. 3 in IBD's Internet-Retail group. It boasts a good 94 Comp Rating, and four consecutive years of annual EPS growth.Morgan Stanley, with a strong 98 Comp Rating, is the No. 1 ranked stock in IBD's Banks-Money Center industry group. Revenue grew 14% and 22% the past two quarters. EPS is expected to rise 17% this year.Delivery service FedEx is another No. 1 ranked stock in its industry group, Transport-Air Freights in its case. Still, EPS growth has slowed for two quarters, growing 24%, 20% and 9% the past three stanzas. Its three-years average annual EPS growth rate is 23%. And it has delivered three straight years of annual EPS growth.Several of the fund's top holdings are household names like Apple (AAPL) and MasterCard (MA). In addition, four top-10 holdings have Comp Ratings in the 80s and 90s, including Home Depot (HD), Nvidia (NVDA) and Comcast (CMCSA).Graphics chipmaker Nvidia, for example, has a top-notch 99 Comp Rating — the highest possible — and six straight quarters of EPS growth acceleration.

177,EBAY,"The adoption of credit-card chip technology by U.S. retailers is having an unintended consequence: Criminals are moving from brick-and-mortar stores to the internet.The use of stolen card data to pay for merchandise on websites, in mobile apps and by dialing call centers surged 40% last year, according to a report from Javelin Strategy & Research released Wednesday. That's forcing merchants to spend billions on online fraud protection in an effort to detect when a crook is using someone else's card number.""We are seeing more sophisticated type of fraud moving into the online environment,"" said Erika Dietrich, global director of payments risk management at fraud fighter ACI Worldwide (ACIW).By the end of last year, almost 1.81 million U.S. merchants had switched to accepting European-style chip cards, more than double the number the year before, according to Visa (V) Issued by banks, cards containing the so-called EMV technology are much harder to counterfeit, which cuts down on in-person fraud at stores.With worldwide e-commerce surging and more stolen data available on the black market, retailers are ramping up spending on online security. E-commerce merchants and financial institutions will spend $9.2 billion annually in fraud-detection solutions by 2020, up 30% from current levels, according to Juniper Research.As recently as October, the fraud-protection company Radial Inc. used to get one to two inquiries from new large customers a month. That number has since climbed to more than 12 a month, said Stefan Weitz, chief product and strategy officer. Radial's more than 100 clients include Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), StubHub and Ralph Lauren (RL).Fueling the surge in interest are an increasing number of data breaches at companies ranging from Target (TGT) to Wendy's (WEN), which potentially exposed private financial information from millions of customers to identity thieves. U.S. government agencies and companies suffered a record 1,093 data breaches last year, up 40% from 2015, according to the Identity Theft Resource Center in San Diego.""There's a great deal of investment not only from StubHub peers, but also from the vendors,"" said Joseph Asaro, head of operations for North America at StubHub, a unit of eBay (EBAY). ""The vendors would not be investing so heavily if there's not great profit in it.""To bolster its arsenal, Visa acquired CardinalCommerce in December to help merchants and banks authenticate e-commerce transactions. New vendors are also entering the fray: This year, Tender Armor LLC, a Fort Lauderdale, Fla.-based startup, will offer its fraud-fighting technology to debit-card customers of InComm Holdings, which issues prepaid cards. Tender Armor texts or e-mails customers a daily code that replaces the one on the back of their cards for purchases.""Because the code is dynamic and only known to the consumer, the fraudsters can't use it,"" Madeline Aufseeser, Tender Armor's chief executive, said in an interview. ""This simple solution deputizes the consumers and puts the control back in their hands.""Meanwhile, payment processor Cayan, which serves mid- to small-sized businesses, plans to integrate security software from Kount. That company uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to help merchants pinpoint fraudulent sales. For each transaction, Kount's engine analyzes hundreds of relevant variables and activity across the globe in real time to predict risk of fraud.Existing fraud-fighting companies' business is blooming. Easy Solutions says sales of its product that helps banks and retailers monitor transactions grew 128 last year, up from a 75% gain in 2015. Radial, which promises to shoulder its clients' fraud costs, saw its sales rise 15% last year.Radial's software can use about 800 rules to determine if a transaction is fraudulent. Suspicious transactions are flagged and sent to several dozen human analysts around the world who can verify addresses, or even call the customers to weed out fraud.""They do detective work at some point,"" said the company's Weitz. ""We guarantee to our customers that they pay zero fraud.""Online sales worldwide are projected to rise to $27.7 trillion in 2020, up from $22 trillion last year, according to researcher eMarketer. North America, the second-largest e-commerce market in the world behind Asia, is expected to see double-digit growth through 2020, eMarketer said. Expansion into new categories such as grocery, and increasing sales through mobile devices are helping to boost sales, the company said.More shopping online means more opportunities for crooks, who are now using sophisticated attack tools such as bots. The software programs can run through online checkout pages and place orders using stolen data automatically — without a human being needing to be involved.""Right now the environment is more challenging than it's ever been,"" said Al Pascual, research director and head of fraud and security at Javelin, a consulting firm focused on the financial industry. ""And things will get worse before they get better.""

This provides a secure and versatile payment method to meet the growing demand for digital entertainment.""PayPal stock rose 3.3% to 56.55 on the stock market today. With Wednesday's gain, PayPal, an IBD 50 stock, has broken out of a base and cleared a technical buy point of 55.24.Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA), other members of IBD's Finance-Credit Card payments group, also are near buy points. Visa rose 0.8%, while Mastercard climbed 0.7% on Wednesday.Square (SQ), viewed by Loop Capital as an acquisition target of PayPal, broke out of a base Tuesday with a 25.07 entry. Square rose 3% to 26.21, still in buy range.PayPal did not disclose terms of the iTunes deal, such as any revenue-sharing with Apple from online purchases. Apple has enabled iPhone and iPad users to make purchases using credit card networks and bank debit cards.PayPal will be listed as on option on the iTunes settings menu. PayPal users will be able to buy apps, digital music, movies, TV shows and books, as well as Apple Music subscriptions and iCloud storage.""PayPal's availability across Apple's services further expands our vision of providing customers a variety of ways to easily make mobile purchases, such as asking Siri to make a payment using the PayPal app,"" the company said.IBD'S TAKE: Square, another digital payments processor, has been added to IBD's Swing Trader list, where the CAN SLIM strategy is employed for quick hits — most trades will last five to 10 days, with a goal of a 10% profit and any loss capped at about 3%. JPMorgan analyst Tien-tsin Huang said the deal is positive for PayPal.""While difficult to size, the deal is significant as it provides yet another example of a payment foe (Apple Pay) choosing to work with PayPal as a payment partner,"" Huang said in a report.PayPal, meanwhile, has hired Mark Britto, a former executive at Amazon.com (AMZN), to lead its lending business.

179,EBAY,"PayPal (PYPL) and Square (SQ) stocks have been on a roll, and now a Loop Capital analyst says it would be a good idea if the two digital payment companies merge.XPayPal's Venmo person-to-person payments system would get a boost from Square's merchant relationships, Loop Capital says.Square stock popped 6.3% to 25.44 on the stock market today, clearing a 25.07 buy point. PayPal shares edged down 0.3% to 54.76 after flirting with a 55.23 buy point for a second straight session. Square stock is up more than 80% in 2017 while PayPal has gained 39%.""PayPal's strategic objectives over the next several years should be to maximize Venmo monetization opportunities, extend PayPal's reach in brick-and-mortar retailers, and stem transaction margin deterioration,"" Loop Capital analyst Joseph Vafi said in a report. ""The acquisition of Square helps check the boxes. Such an acquisition also fits with PayPal's vision of transforming itself into a true, two-sided network. Timing-wise, such a deal makes more sense now that Square is pro-forma profitable.""Vafi added that PayPal can offer a 30% premium for Square without overstretching its balance sheet.Since spun off from eBay (EBAY) in 2015, PayPal has evolved from a payment button to a broad payments service provider, while expanding from online checkout to mobile payments. PayPal stock is up sharply in 2017, despite worries over competition from Apple (AAPL), Amazon.com (AMZN), and startup Stripe.San Francisco-based Square makes credit-card readers that plug into mobile phones and tablets. While Square's primary customers are small businesses, it's attracting bigger customers, analysts say. Square has expanded into financing loans to small businesses.IBD'S TAKE: Square on Tuesday was added to IBD's Swing Trader list, where the CAN SLIM strategy is employed for quick hits — most trades will last five to 10 days, with a goal of a 10% profit and any loss capped at about 3%. ""With millions of active merchants, Square's customer base makes for a tantalizing monetization opportunity for Venmo,"" Vafi said. ""Many of Square's core SMB merchants should be open to accepting Venmo, given it provides access to one of the fastest growing sources of payments around. Merchants could even be incentivized to offer 'Pay With Venmo' while transactions would still be accretive to PayPal's overall transaction margin. Technologically, turning on Venmo would not be difficult, as Square is already integrated with PayPal.""Apple last month introduced a rival to PayPal's Venmo.RELATED:This Hot Payment Stock Flirts With Breakout As 3 Peers Forge Buy Points

180,EBAY,"Sometimes a stock will appear to be forming a cup base, but then the pattern will just fall apart. Before kicking the stock off your watch list, leave it in there a little longer. It may be forming a double-bottom base instead.Like the cup with handle base, the double bottom is one of the more common winning patterns that investors are likely to find.This is a roller coaster pattern that can lead to big gains. Past market winners such as Cisco Systems, eBay and data-storage king EMC all cleared double-bottom bases at one time or another en route to huge gains.The double-bottom base needs at least seven weeks to form. Remember to generally start counting on the first down week. Although rare, some double bottoms can be as long as a year.Typically, the correction in a double-bottom pattern should be no more than 35% in a market uptrend, like the cup with handle. But in bear markets, the correction in a double-bottom pattern can be as deep as 50%.Each price pattern in the CAN SLIM methodology has a certain look. For the double-bottom, it's defined by the W shape with two lows.The second low should undercut the first, creating a shakeout to scare off the weak holders.The middle peak of the double bottom should be lower than the left-side high. If the middle peak is higher, you don't have a double-bottom base.For the double bottom, you don't have to wait until the stock clears the left-side high to buy. The buy point is 10 cents above the middle peak. A double bottom will sometimes form a handle, giving a lower entry point.MDC Holdings (MDC) had a great run in 2012, as the housing market rebounded. The homebuilder was a turnaround; it lost money from 2007 to 2011, but was expected to turn a profit for 2012.The stock formed an eight-week double-bottom base with a 30.05 buy point last year. MDC's middle peak was below its left-side high (1) and the second low undercut the first (2), making it a proper pattern.MDC cleared the base in the week ended June 29 in heavier weekly trade. Volume was soft on its breakout day of June 26, but came in the next day. The stock jumped 40% by September before settling into a new pattern.This article was originally published Jan. 16, 2013.

The U.S. hasn't hit 3% annual GDP growth since 2005.The Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq opened fractionally higher on the stock market today.The slowdown reflected a downturn in exports and acceleration in imports, and a moderating in personal consumption spending during a holiday season that saw growth at Amazon (AMZN), as well as eBay (EBAY) and other online sites helped offset weak results at department stores.Also on Friday, Commerce reported that durable goods orders fell 0.4% vs. estimates of a 3.0% rise. Excluding transportation, orders rose 0.5%.The overall decline was a surprise, in part because Boeing (BA) reported orders for 290 aircraft in December vs. 34 in November. But Ian Shepherdon, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, noted that ""orders always jump between November and December,"" so the seasonal adjustment was an important factor.Durable goods orders are volatile from month to month, but the overall trend has been positive. Core capital goods orders, which exclude defense and aircraft, rose 0.8%, the sixth increase in seven months.Commerce said that prices for personal consumption expenditures rose 2.2% in Q4 vs. 1.5% in Q3, but the core price increase fell to 1.3% vs. 1.7%, excluding food and energy.

""We're closing in on 200 million users on our platform right now. At that scale, it's hard for any retailer to think about not accepting PayPal.""There are no details to announce, but Schulman said the conversations have focused on ""how to use one another's assets to the mutual benefit of our customers.""A spokesman for Seattle-based Amazon (AMZN) declined to comment.The prospect of a deal couldn't keep PayPal shares from plunging in morning trades Friday on disappointing earnings results released late Thursday. Shares ended Friday trade down 3% to 40.27. Amazon slipped 0.4% to 835.77. EBay was up 2.4% to 32.51.PayPal separated from eBay (EBAY) — Amazon's onetime arch rival — to concentrate on expanding its electronic transactions business without being shackled to the slow-growing online marketplace. Schulman, who became CEO after the split, has been forging agreements in an effort to increase the number of people using PayPal and the frequency with which they use it.Amazon has its own payment ambitions and hired Patrick Gauthier from San Jose, Calif.-based PayPal in 2015 to lead its initiative. Amazon is balancing its desire to control payments with its customer-centric philosophy, given PayPal's reach.PayPal on Thursday reported 197 million active customer accounts in the fourth quarter, with 31 transactions per account in the trailing 12 months.

188,EBAY,"EBay (EBAY) is set to report quarterly earnings after the market close Wednesday, with the Wall Street consensus calling for single-digit growth on the top and bottom lines.Analysts expect eBay will report fourth-quarter revenue of $2.4 billion, up 4% year over year, with earnings per share minus items rising 8% to 54 cents.Benchmark analyst Daniel Kurnos has a buy rating and price target of 37 on eBay stock. He says eBay could be an ""under-the-radar beneficiary"" of the holiday shopping period, having been overshadowed by Amazon (AMZN), which had a strong holiday shopping period. Amazon is scheduled to report its Q4 earnings on Thursday Feb. 2.

189,EBAY,"""Given eBay's value niche during what appeared to be an overly price-conscious holiday period, we suspect that they too may have taken market share in addition to Amazon, who most believe was the primary beneficiary,"" Kurnos wrote in a research note.EBay stock plunged on Oct. 20 after its Q3 earnings and Q4 guidance disappointed analysts in some key areas. The company has taken several steps to boost growth. This includes pricing changes targeted at high-volume inventory liquidators, an increase in the number of new product listings available across its marketplaces and a modernized website.EBay has also implemented a structured-data initiative that aims to stimulate faster user-growth, lower the cost of traffic acquisition, and improve the user experience by making it easier for buyers on its site to find the best products.The effort is needed as eBay faces competition not just from Amazon, but also from the likes of Facebook (FB) and Alphabet (GOOGL).Facebook is pushing deeper into e-commerce services with new features that enable users to order food, get movie tickets, get a quote from local businesses and request an appointment. The new services follow Facebook's launch of an online venue, called Marketplace, designed to formalize a local buying and selling process that was already taking place on its ""Groups"" feature, posing a threat to eBay and Craigslist.Amazon is positioned to be the foremost beneficiary of two of the most important secular trends in the global economy — e-commerce and cloud computing services.RELATED:Amazon Plants A 'We're Hiring' Sign To Reach 100,000 New JobsAuto Parts Retailers Banged Up As Amazon Moves In

Analysts had expected EPS of 68 cents on sales of $604.8 million.Several big customers, including Apple (AAPL) and Facebook, have shifted some of their traffic to internal networks, slowing Akamai's revenue growth. Akamai said media business revenue fell 10% in Q4 to $196 million, while its performance and security business revenue rose 17% to $367 million.RELATED:Disney Chief's Confidence In ESPN Comes In Part From ...

192,EBAY,"More than 33 million Amazon (AMZN) customers used the company's payment system to make a purchase in 2016, as payment volume nearly doubled.The 33 million customers of Amazon Payments is up from 23 million since April 2015, the company said.Amazon is making a concerted effort to expand its online payment abilities. It relaunched Amazon Payments in 2013 after years of experiments in the online payments field.Payment processor PayPal (PYPL) recently said it's in talks with Amazon about a partnership. PayPal already has agreements with Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA), as well as with Facebook (FB).Cowen analyst George Mihalos, in a research note, said he does not believe a PayPal deal with Amazon is imminent, and he expects the companies ""likely will remain competitors on multiple fronts.""Amazon stock rose 0.6% to 812.50 in the stock market today. PayPal stock rose 0.7% to 40.02. PayPal stock has retreated from an all-time high of 44.15 set on Oct. 21. The company was spun off from eBay (EBAY) in July 2015.IBD'S TAKE: Analysts mostly gave Amazon a thumbs down on its fourth-quarter earnings report posted late Thursday, which missed on revenue, as did its Q1 outlook, sending the stock down on Friday.With Amazon Payments, merchants can choose to integrate services such as Pay with Amazon, offering simpler ways for online shoppers to authenticate with their Amazon account on a third-party website.The increase in users of Amazon Payments is attributable, in part, to the expansion of Amazon Payments into France, Italy and Spain and into new markets such as government payments, travel, digital goods, insurance, entertainment, nonprofits and charities.Amazon Payments competes with PayPal, Visa, Mastercard and others in the payment processing field.""As consumers shop in more and more ways — online, in store, and on the go — their expectations for speed, convenience and personalization continue to grow,"" said Patrick Gauthier, vice president of Amazon Payments, in the company's press release.RELATED:Workday Adds Amazon As Customer, After Wal-Mart Deal

193,EBAY,"We now have a new paper from economist Robert J. Gordon of Northwestern University that seeks to answer a great puzzle of our time: ""Why has economic growth slowed when innovation appears to be accelerating?"" In the process, Gordon illuminates a dispute between the Trump administration (which thinks growth can be increased) and its critics (who are dubious).The ""real"" economy that we experience directly and the one defined by statistics are strikingly different. The first seems awash with innovation, from smartphones to driverless cars. And yet, the statistical economy is lackluster. From 1970 to 2006, U.S. economic growth averaged 3.2% a year; from 2006 and 2016, growth averaged 1.4%, reports Gordon.That's a huge decline. It matters, as Gordon says, because faster growth generates more tax revenues to ""address the nation's problems, including faltering education, aging infrastructure, and the looming shortfall in funding for Social Security and Medicare."" Not to mention immense budget deficits.What explains the growth slowdown?As a matter of arithmetic, economic growth consists of two parts. First, the number of workers and how long they work; that's the ""labor force."" And second, their skills — that's their ""productivity."" A brain surgeon is more productive than, say, a ditch-digger.Gordon says that, contrary to conventional wisdom, flagging productivity gains aren't the main cause of the economic slowdown. According to his calculations, nearly three-fifths (57%) of the economic slowdown from 2007 to 2017 reflects changes in the labor force. The most obvious is the retirement of baby boomers from the job market. Likewise, a growing proportion of men in their prime earning years (ages 25 to 54) are dropping out of the labor market.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThese changes are significant in their own right, but they also seem to exonerate lower productivity growth — basically, new technologies, products and organizational changes — as the main culprit in the decline of overall economic growth.This leaves only about two-fifths (43%) of the decline in economic growth to be explained by weaker productivity gains. Gordon acknowledges the tidal wave of new internet products: Facebook, YouTube, eBay. But he argues that their very visibility exaggerates their economic significance. They pale in comparison to many earlier inventions — the automobile or electricity generation, for example. So productivity growth has also slumped.The debate between the Trump administration and its economic critics involves whether, and how much, these trends can be easily altered by government policies. Can the government increase economic growth above today's disappointing levels?President Trump and his economic advisers have been arguing that they can. Favorable tax policies for businesses will, the argument goes, stimulate more investment in technologically advanced industries. Productivity growth will improve, boosting overall economic growth. That was the theory behind the Trump tax cut — the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act — passed late last year.Not so fast, say critics. The negative trends affecting the economy reflect deep social problems that resist change. ""Rising educational attainment during the 20th century was an important source of productivity growth,"" writes Gordon, ""but the pace of that increase slowed markedly after 1980."" The truth is that we've been trying to improve schools for decades with, at best, modest success.Or take the drain of prime-age men from the job market. The main problem, argues Gordon, ""reflects in large part the loss of stable middle-income employment opportunities."" The result has been fewer marriages, more drug use and more suicides, writes Gordon. None of this is easily altered. Among 20 advanced countries, the United States has the second lowest labor-force participation rate of prime-age men. Only Italy is lower.We seem to have entered a new economic era — one defined more by the limits on our economic power than by its promises. The explosion of new technologies seems to have fooled us into thinking that a burst of innovation will magically restore our economic vitality. On the evidence, this is a mirage.Other columns by Robert Samuelson

195,EBAY,"The financial impact of a partnership between e-commerce giant Amazon.com (AMZN) and PayPal Holdings (PYPL) would be ""insignificant,"" but both companies would still gain from forging a deal, says a Cowen & Co. analyst.PayPal's CEO Dan Schulman told Bloomberg recently that the payment processor is in talks with Amazon. PayPal has recently announced agreements with credit card networks Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA) as well as social media firm Facebook (FB).EBay (EBAY) spun off PayPal in 2015, giving the payments company more leeway to make alliances.""A potential Amazon-PayPal partnership could be a win-win, even if the direct financial impact is insignificant,"" George Mihalos, a Cowen analyst, said in a research report Monday. ""It would, however, give the PayPal wallet a more ubiquitous presence, which could lead to greater overall customer engagement — a key consideration behind PayPal's recent in-store payments strategy consummated with the networks Visa and Mastercard.IBD'S TAKE: Broadcom, Inphi and GrubHub are among IBD's Sector Leaders, a list that highlights the best stocks in 33 sectors.

PayPal has a technical buy point of 44.62.Amazon stock edged down 0.3% to finish at 807.64. Amazon late Thursday reported better-than-expected earnings for the holiday quarter. But sales fell short, and the e-commerce giant's revenue outlook missed, sending the stock down on Friday. Amazon cleared a cup-with-handle buy point of 821.75 on Jan. 14.Partnering with PayPal would be a plus for Amazon, Mihalos says.""We think this is much less about creating the next big revenue stream for Amazon and more about deepening its reach with both its existing user base and new merchants, especially small and medium-sized businesses,"" he said.PayPal in October posted Q4 earnings and revenue that met Wall Street expectations, but the midpoint of its Q1 guidance came in a bit light.RELATED:Could Google Bid For Salesforce.com Despite Amazon Cloud Pact?PayPal Q4 Earnings, Revenue In Line; Q1 Guidance Bit LightAmazon Analysts Turn Sour Following Q4 Results Below Views

196,EBAY,"As soon as President Trump signed his executive order calling for two regulations to be eliminated for every new one enacted, the usual suspects started to complain.Union of Concerned Scientists President Ken Kimmell called it ""absurd, imposing a Sophie's Choice on federal agencies.""William Gale of the left-of-center Brookings Institution complained that ""there's no logic to this.""Public Citizen head Robert Weissman called Trump's order ""unworkable,"" ""harmful,"" ""unprecedented and untested,"" and ""horrifying.""""Americans will once again have to pay the price for the consequences of corporate recklessness, greed and lawbreaking,"" Weissman added for good measure.Trump's executive order, signed on Monday, doesn't deregulate anything. It simply is an attempt to cap the current costs of regulations this year by requiring agencies to offset the costs of any new rule by eliminating regulations that impose equal costs.""The heads of all agencies are directed that the total incremental cost of all new regulations, including repealed regulations, to be finalized this year shall be no greater than zero,"" the order said.It's a tiny first step toward cutting the enormous cost of federal regulations — which by some estimates adds up to almost $1.9 trillion a year.What critics of deregulation fail to mention, however, is that it is greedy corporations that are likely to be one of Trump's biggest opponents when it comes to dismantling, or even taming, the federal government's massively complex and enormously expensive regulatory state.Soon after Trump was elected, for example, more than 350 companies signed a letter urging him not to abandon the Paris climate change agreement that President Obama had signed onto. ""Failure to build a low-carbon economy puts American prosperity at risk,"" the letter said.Among those companies signing it were household names like General Mills (GIS), Kellogg (K), DuPont (DD), eBay (EBAY), Starbucks (SBUX), Staples (SPLS), Nike (NKE) and Intel (INTC).Trump's effort to fix Dodd-Frank won't get much support from the banking industry, either.Business Insider reports that ""bankers are concerned the Trump administration, joined by like-minded Congress, will scrape or significantly change the rules.""Dodd-Frank required banks to invest in staff and technology and make other changes to comply with that law's vast web of regulations. But ""now that Dodd-Frank is largely in effect, the industry sees a total elimination as more of a threat than a blessing.""Brokerage firms worry that the Labor Department's ""fiduciary rule"" could be in jeopardy. BlackRock (BLK) CEO Larry Fink said on a January earnings call that the rule ""has some very great components in it.""Why would companies be pushing to keep costly regulations in place?This is the dirty secret that so-called public-interest groups never share. Big corporations are often the biggest beneficiaries, and at times the strongest advocates, of federal regulations.Daniel Hannan, a member of the European Parliament, put it best during the Brexit debate last year. Big business vigorously supported the Remain campaign, he noted, despite the fact that EU regulations were suffocating the British economy.""Ask yourself why it is that the megabanks and the multinationals are pouring money into the Remain campaign,"" Hannan said. ""I'll tell you why. The biggest surprise for me when I was a newly elected MEP was the extent to which these giant corporations wanted more regulation. They love regulation because they can afford the compliance costs more easily than their smaller rivals.""See? Regulations can give big companies a competitive advantage — not only can they more easily afford the cost of regulatory compliance than their smaller competitors, they can finance an army of lobbyists to make sure the rules are written to their benefit.The most noteworthy effect of Dodd-Frank, for example, hasn't been that it's made the financial sector less vulnerable — as IBD noted recently, it hasn't. It is, instead, the destruction of smaller community banks, which in turn has let large banks further consolidate their grip on the industry.""The number of community banks (those with less than $10 billion in assets) shrank 14% between Dodd-Frank's passage in 2010 and late 2014,"" noted Harvard Business School's Marshall Lux and Robert Greene. ""When regulations — not consumers — drive consolidation, banking system risk increases,"" they wrote.Some other examples, courtesy of the Cato Institute:Airline deregulation is another prime example of how big business fights deregulation more fiercely that it fights regulation.Before 1978, the federal Civil Aeronautics Board controlled airline routes and fares. Airlines routinely complained about CAB rules, but when President Carter and liberal Sen. Ted Kennedy teamed up to deregulate the airline industry, it was the airlines themselves that mounted a determined fight against it, and encouraged their employees to do likewise.The chairman of Delta Airlines (DAL) at the time called deregulation a ""wolf in sheep's clothing,"" saying it would somehow lead to more regulation and ""perhaps eventual nationalization"" of the airline industry.Carter ignored these warnings and disbanded the CAB. The result made life tougher for airline executives, but it was a consumer bonanza of increased competition and far lower rates.Yet despite countless such examples over the decades, this dynamic goes almost entirely unrecognized when the subject of federal regulations comes up. Regulations are always portrayed as helping the little guy at the expense of big business — when the reality is often the opposite.This isn't to say that big business will always fight against deregulation. But when it comes to free-market policies, corporate executives can be fickle friends. And if Donald Trump wants to live up to his promise to deregulate the economy, he's likely going to have to take on not just the liberal left, but some of the biggest businesses in the world.RELATED:Now They Tell Us: Trump's Economic Plan Will Boost GrowthTrump Day One To-Do List: Repeal $1.7 Billion Of Dodd-Frank RulesIs Ford's Move A Cave-In To Trump Protectionist Talk, Or A Savvy Bet On Future?

208,EBAY,"Regeneron (REGN) and Sanofi (SNY) argue that Amgen's (AMGN) patents covering LDL-buster Repatha are too broad. And on Friday, the duo asked a federal judge to stay a permanent injunction of their rival drug, Praluent, pending the appeal.The ban on Praluent is set to go into effect Feb. 21. Regeneron and Sanofi argued in their request that the injunction is likely to be invalidated on appeal based on ""numerous flaws in the underlying judgment,"" which include the validity of Amgen's patents.In its patents, Amgen didn't identify any structural feature ""common to"" the genus, but rather defined the genus based on where the antibodies bind, Regeneron and Sanofi wrote. Like Repatha, Praluent prevents PCSK9 from binding to the LDL receptor. But Praluent is a different antibody with a different structure.""Remarkably, however, the district court precluded appellants from presenting evidence of Praluent's own structure, thereby preventing appellants from showing the jury that ... Repatha is more structurally similar to antibodies to influenza and the rabies virus than it is to Praluent,"" they wrote.IBD'S TAKE: Drug stocks took a beating last week on commentary from President-elect Donald Trump that he will require new bidding procedures to curb spiraling drug prices. Get the scoop in IBD's Industry Themes.In their argument, Regeneron and Sanofi say the injunction will cause them irreparable harm, whereas a stay pending the appeal would not irreparably harm Amgen.An injunction on Praluent is counter to public interest, Regeneron and Sanofi said, citing a case involving eBay (EBAY). That case set a number of prerequisites for issuing a permanent injunction. This case involves thousands of patients and shouldn't be the first in which the court grants a ban against public interest.""Put simply, this is not a case about cellphones and tablets; it is about heart attacks and strokes,"" Regeneron and Sanofi wrote. ""It is no exaggeration to say that the injunction will take lifesaving medicine away from thousands of patients and leave them with no adequate replacement.""By the closing bell on the stock market today, Regeneron stock had toppled hardest, down 1.3% to 363.24. Sanofi stock followed, down 1.2% to 40.96.

209,EBAY,"No. 1 biotech Amgen (AMGN) will likely triumph in a patent battle with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Sanofi (SNY), requiring the duo to pull LDL-buster Praluent from the shelves — an unprecedented first, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said Friday.Regeneron and Sanofi have asked a federal circuit judge to grant a stay of the injunction beyond 45 days. That would allow them to market Praluent during the appeal, which typically runs up 16 months, Porges wrote in a research report Friday.But the odds don't look good. Specialists believe ""regardless of the ultimate merits of Regeneron and Sanofi's case, they will face an unprecedented (and probably first) branded pharmaceutical product withdrawal in the middle of this quarter,"" he wrote.The most important catalyst will be whether the Federal Circuit extends the stay, Porges says. Of 158 permanent injunctions (PIs) granted in federal or district court since a 2006 case involving Ebay, only 37 parties (23%) were granted a stay.IBD'S TAKE: Alnylam Pharmaceuticals and The Medicines Company have a different-enough LDL drug that shouldn't touch Amgen's patents, analysts say. The Medicines Co. presented data at the annual JPMorgan Healthcare Conference. Check out five key take-aways from the meeting.In Regeneron and Sanofi's case, though, it would be the first time a branded drug would be pulled from shelves as a result of patent litigation. They have made the argument that public interest would not be served by pulling Praluent, which offers a lower dosage than Amgen's Repatha.Examining medical-device cases, the district court has stayed a PI in five cases. But at the federal level, the PI was affirmed and not extended, resulting in the removal of those products from the market. Those precedents appear to be ""stacked"" against Regeneron and Sanofi, Porges said.To Regeneron and Sanofi's public interest argument, Porges noted that public interest is actually better served in siding with the patent holder, thus encouraging the risky investment required in bringing an innovative product to market.Porges also looks at several outcomes. It's possible that the case could be remanded to the district court. The federal circuit could also require Amgen, Regeneron and Sanofi to seek settlement assistance via the Circuit Mediation Office. But that process only happens in 10%-20% of cases.Amgen, the No. 1 biotech firm by market cap, is unlikely to settle, he wrote. The company ""notoriously takes the stance to never settle IP disputes and vigorously defends the company's IP, as evidenced by the blockage of market entry for Roche's Epogen competitor Mircera until the infringed patent expired.""In the stock market today, Amgen stock rose 0.49% to 156.12, but Regeneron rose 1% to 368.16 and Sanofi rose 2.1% to 41.47.RELATED:Could Sanofi Acquire BioMarin In Wake Of Amgen LDL Brouhaha?Regeneron, Sanofi Hammers After Judge Bans Amgen-Rivaling LDL-Buster

210,EBAY,"The CEO of Alibaba Group (BABA) fired back at allegations by the U.S. Trade Representative office that the e-commerce giant sells counterfeit products.The USTR on Wednesday placed Alibaba back on its ""Notorious Markets"" list for counterfeit and pirated items. Alibaba was taken off the list in 2012 after implementing a robust anti-counterfeiting program that the company says surpasses every other company worldwide and is above and beyond what laws require.The USTR listing pertains to Alibaba's Taobao Marketplace, a consumer-to-consumer website similar to eBay (EBAY) which is visited by Chinese consumers looking for a wide selection of goods. The site features ""hundreds of millions of product and service listings,"" Alibaba says. According to iResearch, Taobao was China's largest mobile commerce destination by monthly active users in 2015.""The fight against counterfeit is a fight against the dark side of human nature,"" wrote Alibaba CEO Daniel Zhang, in a letter to employees. ""Counterfeiters are like bacteria in the air that we breathe. Eradicating counterfeits require serious, long term commitment and cannot be achieved overnight.""IBD'S TAKE: Alibaba has a weak Accumulation/Distribution Rating of E, suggesting institutional investors are selling shares. Here's a look at IBD Tech Leaders.Taobao was previously on the list and removed four years ago after Alibaba successfully lobbied U.S. officials. It was added again in 2016 ""due to the large volume of allegedly counterfeit and pirated goods available and the challenges right holders experience in removing and preventing illicit sales and offers of such goods,"" said the USTR report that prompted Taobao's return to the list, citing complaints from brand owners.The USTR decision does not come with any official penalty or punishments and is not expected to have a major impact on Alibaba's China operations. Alibaba reported better-than-expected fiscal second-quarter earnings and sales last month, fueled by growth in its e-commerce business and its booming cloud-computing services.But the USTR ruling is a scar that could cause shoppers to head over to Alibaba rival JD.com (JD), which runs a website and operations similar to Amazon.com (AMZN). For Q4, JD.com said it expects revenue of $10.9 billion to $11 billion, up 37% to 42% in local currency.Merchants on Amazon have also felt the impact of counterfeit goods. Last month, Amazon filed two lawsuits against merchants that are allegedly selling counterfeit items on its marketplace.Zhang said Alibaba has been active and aggressive in combating counterfeit goods and has launched ""an all-out war against counterfeits.""In 2016, he added, ""Working with law enforcement, we shut down many counterfeit manufacturing factories and sent over 800 counterfeiters to prison in the protection of brand owners.""Alibaba's U.S.-listed stock closed down 2.75% at 86.80 in the stock market today, falling below its 200-day line for the first time in six months. JD.com stock fell 1% to end at 25.62, while Amazon lost 0.55% to finish at 766.34.

211,EBAY,"As malls die, Macy's (M) plans huge job cuts, and Sears (SHLD) closes 150 stores, online sales on sites like Amazon (AMZN) and devices like your Apple (AAPL) iPhone, to the surprise of perhaps nobody, were higher during the 2016 holiday season.Online sales rose 11% a record $91.7 billion, Adobe (ADBE) said Thursday, slightly surpassing the company's own expectations for $91.6 billion. More of those sales were made via mobile devices, which drove half of site visits, Adobe said. Mobile sales jumped 23% to $28.43 billion.Other surveys have suggested that Amazon grabbed a huge share of that e-commerce growth. But it didn't entirely hog the spotlight. Online auction site eBay (EBAY) was the most mentioned retailer on social media, ""with eBay sellers promoting their items for purchase and eBay buyers highlighting products they bought that they couldn't find in stores,"" Adobe said.Amazon shares rose 3.1% to 780.45 in heavy volume on the stock market today, retaking its 50-day moving average. Amazon hadn't closed above that key support level since Oct. 27, when the online giant missed earnings estimates and gave cautious guidance.Shares of eBay edged up, continuing to trade comfortably above their 50-day. Apple, which announced December App Store revenue hit $3 billion in December, also nudged higher, close to a buy point.Amazon, Wal-Mart (WMT) and Target (TGT) lagged eBay in social-media mentions.Pokemon Sun/Moon was the most frequently mentioned product, followed by Barbie, Oculus and Legos.""But it's not just the total online sales figure that made this a historic holiday shopping season,"" said Tamara Gaffney, principal analyst and director at Adobe Digital Insights, in a statement. ""This year, Black Friday set a new record by surpassing the $3 billion mark for the first time at $3.34 billion, with high growth in the evening hours.""Black Friday also became the first day in retail history to bring in more than $1 billion in mobile sales, she said.And Adobe's report indicated that more people are doing their buying later in the holiday season — posing more challenges to the delivery infrastructures of UPS (UPS) and FedEx (FDX).Sales accelerated closer to the end of last month, Adobe said, as shipping cutoff dates approached and more customers made purchases online and picked them up in stores.IBD'S TAKE: As malls become relics of the retail and real estate world and Amazon comes to dominate more forms of commerce, many store chains will face a reckoning this year.The gains in online sales have come at the expense of many brick-and-mortar retailers. Macy's and Kohl's (KSS) slashed earnings views late Wednesday as both reported a 2.1% same-store sales decline in November and December. Barnes & Noble (BKS) also said holiday sales were grim, while Sears announced a new raft of store closures and sold its Craftsman tool line.Macy's shares crashed 14% Thursday, Kohl's 19% and Barnes & Noble nearly 7%. Other department stores, apparel retailers and makers and other retail-related groups were big losers Thursday.Those follow other signs that physical stores were suffering.Handbag maker and retailer Kate Spade (KATE) is reportedly exploring a sale, while Nordstrom (JWN) management, according to a JPMorgan report, said brick-and-mortar traffic was at its worst levels in more than 40 years.Off-price retailers, however, have fared better against the likes of Amazon in part due to their ""treasure hunt"" appeal, in which shoppers don't entirely know what kind of bargain they're going to find.RELATED:Christmas Meltdown: Macy's, Kohl's, Kors, Fossil, L Brands, OthersWhat's Driving The Success Of 'Un-Amazon-Able' Ulta Beauty?Ross Stores: A No-Nonsense Retailer Free From Amazon's Clutches

217,EBAY,"Without its stellar group of ""cloud titan"" customers, network gear maker Arista Networks' (ANET) rise in the data center switching market vs. goliath Cisco Systems (CSCO) might never have happened.Now it's poised to make an even stronger move in the market, provided it can hang on to those customers, the likes of which include Microsoft (MSFT), Facebook (FB), Netflix (NFLX), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet's Google (GOOGL), eBay (EBAY)  and Yahoo (YHOO).These tech behemoths all buy speedy network switches and software for use in data centers that provide cloud computing services from Arista, even though industry leader Cisco now holds nearly 60% of the data center-switching market. Many of those companies will rely on Arista more as they crave faster network speeds to whisk content and apps to mobile devices or, in Netflix's case, stream high-quality video.While some of Arista's blue-chip clients are now developing their own switching hardware, a development that has some analysts worried, others say Arista's software expertise gives it an edge as the market evolves.""Arista is gaining share by focusing on the needs of a very demanding set of data center customers. They have a big presence with (web) hyperscalers, the cloud titans,"" said Brad Casemore, an analyst at research firm IDC.Arista had about 8.4% of the market in slower Ethernet switching in 2015, but its share is double that in higher-speed 40- and 100-gigabit sectors. Consequently, Arista's share of the overall market is close to 10%, Casemore estimates. IDC expects demand for 40- and 100-gigabit switches to boom through 2020 and for Arista to grow along with that.It's all helped Arista see its revenue jump 35% in the first nine months of 2016 to $801 million. Its stock has nearly doubled since reaching a low in early February. But shares dipped 1.4% to 93.14 Monday after a judge ruled that the company had infringed on patents held by Cisco.When it was founded in 2004, Arista first went after banks that needed high-speed switching for equities trading. Four years later, it began focusing on cloud data centers, says Chief Executive Jayshree Ullal.""When we spotted the cloud opportunity we were almost too early for it,"" Ullal told IBD in an interview. ""What we saw was the rise of cloud companies, the proliferation of mobile devices and new cloud applications that were very different than enterprise applications, very distributed, and that required a network that could aggregate information in a real-time fashion.""Arista's Ethernet switches speed up communications between computer servers packed into the data centers, and interconnect racks of servers in different buildings so they behave like one data center. While Arista has feasted on cloud networking, some of its internet customers — notably Facebook — have been developing their own data center technology.Facebook and Google have pioneered open-source software concepts in data centers. They lowered data center costs by running software on so-called ""white-box"" servers, built by lesser-known suppliers from Asia.One worry is that cloud builders may use contract manufacturers to make their own network switches — basically servers with built-in, high-speed communications functions — at the expense of Arista, Cisco and other suppliers. Ullal says Arista isn't worried about the white box trend.""We're a software company,"" she said. ""We could run on anybody's white box if customers wanted it. We don't view what Facebook or other companies do as a threat, we see it as an opportunity and as collaboration.""Some analysts aren't so sure. When Facebook, Arista's second-biggest customer behind Microsoft, in November announced ""Backpack,"" its first 100-gigabit switch, it set off alarm bells among industry watchers at Goldman Sachs.""Facebook believes it now has a full road-map to building a data center,"" a report from the investment bank said. ""We view these developments as a long-term negative for data center switching vendors Arista, Cisco, and Juniper (Networks) (JNPR).""IDC says original design manufacturer, or ODM, switch makers — contract manufacturers of white-box switches — had 12.3% of the 100-gigabit data center market in 2015, third in market share behind Cisco and Arista. Players in that market include Cumulus, Pluribus Networks, and Big Switch.Peter Christy, an analyst at 451 Research, says it's a ""fact of life"" that Google, Amazon.com (AMZN) and Facebook design and engineer their own massive data centers. Microsoft is less focused on white-box switch replacement, analysts say.""They have unique networks,"" Christy told IBD. ""It's a real problem for the switching industry that the highest growth segment is increasingly being (sourced) internally.""But Mark Moskowitz, analyst at Barclays, says worries over Facebook's switching venture and those of others may be overblown.""While cloud service providers from time-to-time experiment with homegrown switching applications, such initiatives are not to fully displace the merchant suppliers,"" Moskowitz said in a report. ""In certain cases, these homegrown efforts are designed to influence the technology road maps of the merchant suppliers.""Citigroup analyst Stanley Kovler said in a report that Arista's risk of market share loss due to the white-box trend is ""negligible as Arista's products are primarily in the core, complex part of the data center.""IBD'S TAKE: Arista shares broke out above 90 in late November and have reached new all-time highs in several sessions since then. The company is at the top of the class among networking companies in performance. For a stock checkup on Arista, check here.IDC's Casemore says the white box trend as well as competition from China-based Huawei in switching are reasons why Arista is pushing into the $13 billion network router market, taking on Cisco and Juniper. Routers whisk data from data centers across the internet. Arista is using a new Broadcom chip called ""Jericho"" in router products, now in trials.Arista, which has over 4,000 switching customers, aims to have over 100 routing customers by mid-2017. Morgan Stanley, in a report, estimates that Arista could garner $200 million to $300 million in revenue from router products by 2020.""Network design is changing. It's getting more difficult to distinguish switching from routing,"" Ullal said. ""This is a natural opportunity for us, but it's not going to happen overnight.""Arista, which raised $226 million in its 2014 initial public offering, now is on track to easily top $1 billion in 2016 sales. Barclay's Moskowitz says it could hit $2 billion by 2020 based on share gains in the data center switching market alone.Aside from its push into the routing market, Arista aims to target the corporate market through a new alliance with Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (HPE). And, it aims to grow revenue from government customers as well.Family trusts formed by co-founders Andy Bechtolsheim and David Cheriton hold about 27% of outstanding shares, while Arista's top 10 shareholders own nearly 67% of the company's float, says Thomson Reuters.To keep its edge, Arista Networks has been spending 20% to 22% of sales on research and development.""Networking has been written off as being mature, but Arista is redefining networking for our customers,"" Ullal said. ""The company was really built by engineers for engineers.""

Third-quarter EPS topped, but overall revenue missed and organic industrial orders fell.GE shares initially fell to an eight-month low Friday morning, but closed the week fractionally higher.The nation's largest insurer sailed past third-quarter earnings estimates Tuesday, raised its 2016 earnings forecast, and indicated that it would likely boost 2017 guidance next month. Earnings per share climbed 23% to $2.17 vs. the expected $2.08, due to a drop in medical costs as a share of premiums and strong growth in its Optum health services unit, which has seen revenue growth of 34% year to date. Overall revenue rose 12% from a year ago to $46.3 billion, topping estimates of $46.09 billion.UnitedHealth (UNH) rose 8.55% to 145.37 for the week, above a 144.58 buy point.Existing-home sales jumped in September after pulling back from cycle highs over the prior two months. Housing starts fell sharply yet again, but single-family starts jumped and building permits were strong.

The Philly Fed manufacturing index rose.Bank of America (BAC), Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) got a lift from their bond-trading desks during the third quarter, with Brexit-related activity and easy comparisons from a year ago likely helping.

That is up 1% year over year but a slowdown from 6% growth in Q2.

UBS analyst Eric Sheridan raised his price target on eBay stock to 36 from 34. Sheridan wrote that the main investor debate with respect to eBay is the opportunity for its structured-data initiative. The initiative is designed to stimulate faster user-growth, lower the cost of traffic acquisition, and improve the user experience, making it easier for buyers on its site to find the best products.RELATED:New High For eBay On Bullish Report Saying Best Days Are Ahead

225,EBAY,"Airbnb's claim that it's just a conduit for user-generated content was rejected by a judge who said the company may not be able to duck a San Francisco law punishing it when hosts book units that aren't registered with the city.U.S. District Judge James Donato on Tuesday rebuffed Airbnb's argument that because it operates on the internet, it can't be held responsible if users circumvent local laws. Still, the judge stopped short of letting San Francisco enforce its measure, saying he needs more information to decide whether the city has adequate procedures for verifying registrations.Had the world's fourth-most valuable startup succeeded in its early attempt to block the ordinance enacted in June by its hometown, the strategy might have served as a template for other gig economy firms challenging regulations across the U.S. Instead, while Airbnb may appeal Donato's ruling, other cities struggling with high housing costs may now be emboldened to follow San Francisco's model.""While we appreciate that the judge has acknowledged our concerns about the inadequacy of the screening obligations in the new law and has continued to postpone enforcement of these rules as a result, we respectfully disagree with the remainder of his ruling,"" Airbnb spokesman Nick Papas said in an email. ""No matter what happens in this case, we want to work with the city to fix the broken system long before the legal process runs its course.""City Attorney Dennis Herrera said the ruling reinforces that ""online businesses don't get a free pass from the types of regulations that apply to other businesses in San Francisco.""""They have to play by the rules, just like everybody else,"" he said in a statement. ""These platforms have numerous options to verify whether hosts have registered with the city and comply with the law.""Airbnb is already fighting its next major legal battle against the city and state of New York, using the same arguments that failed in San Francisco to challenge a law that fines residents who rent out their apartments for illegal short-term stays.The company also has a pending case against beachfront Santa Monica in Southern California. Anaheim, home to Disneyland, dropped its effort to regulate Airbnb less than two weeks after it was sued by Airbnb.San Francisco's measure imposes a fine of as much as $1,000 a day on rental platforms for every booking of an unregistered host, plus possible misdemeanor charges, and blocks the companies from collecting fees from those bookings.Michael Risch, a professor at Villanova University School of Law in Pennsylvania, said it's not certain that other cities will follow San Francisco's lead in adopting home-sharing regulations because the judge's ""logic is difficult to follow"" in Tuesday's ruling.""The court has clearly held that Airbnb is not immune due to its marketplace functions,"" Risch said. ""It may embolden other states and judges to find creative ways to circumvent the 'content from users' rule. Or, other courts may simply disagree with the logic here, creating a split of authorities.""Airbnb argued a 20-year-old U.S. law shields it from liability tied to users in the same way eBay (EBAY) isn't responsible for sales of bootleg recordings or StubHub for scalped tickets. Airbnb's online transactions and fees are protected by the Communications Decency Act of 1996 because they are ""part and parcel"" of its service, it claimed.San Francisco contended the company's attack on the ordinance was absurd because it wasn't intended to police what rental hosts upload to the website. The ordinance ""regulates only conduct — an unlawful commercial transaction, not speech,"" the city argued.The San Francisco law ""does not threaten the liability plaintiffs fear,"" Donato wrote in his ruling. It doesn't treat Airbnb as a publisher of the rental listings provided by hosts or regulate what's said in the listings, he wrote. Instead, the law holds the company liable only for providing and collecting a fee for booking services for unregistered units, Donato ruled.Airbnb is ""perfectly free to publish any listing they get from a host and to collect fees for doing so — whether the unit is lawfully registered or not — without threat of prosecution or penalty,"" Donato wrote.The judge said San Francisco shouldn't enforce the law until after he hears further discussion of the city's mechanism for verifying whether rentals are legally registered. Donato left open the possibility that Airbnb could still win an order blocking the law based on the company's objections to possible criminal sanctions without a clear verification system.In October, the city and state of New York said they would hold off enforcing new restrictions on short-term apartment sublets against Airbnb until the company's lawsuit in that state is resolved. The move was a reversal from earlier indications that the restrictions would be enforced immediately after New York Governor Andrew Cuomo signed them into law on Oct. 21. The home-sharing company sued to block the measure just hours after Cuomo's action.In the San Francisco fight, Airbnb, with a valuation of $30 billion, garnered support from competitor Expedia's (EXPE) HomeAway, as well as a group representing Amazon.com (AMZN), Facebook (FB) and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google. The Internet Association, whose members also include Uber Technologies and ride-hailing rival Lyft, said the dispute has wide-ranging implications for free speech on the internet.MORE ABOUT AIRBNB:Airbnb Could Bring Riches, Even If You're Not A Property OwnerFull-Time Landlords Bring $500 Mil On Airbnb: StudyKey To A Great Airbnb Vacation Is Taking Other Guests' Word For It

""By enabling customer choice and streamlining the sign-up process, (CFO Rainey) believes PayPal will be able to activate these customers.""By our math, adding 1 million active accounts per month (12 million annually) could translate into 8% to 10% EPS upside (although we note that incremental customer service and support costs could dampen the upside).""PayPal recently announced partnerships with credit card networks Visa (V) and MasterCard (MA).The payment processor in October posted Q3 earnings and revenue that edged Wall Street views and raised its revenue growth forecast for a three-year period to 16%-17% from its previous guidance of 15%.PayPal stock is up 15% in 2016 but has slipped from its all-time high of 44.52, touched on Oct. 24, and is near its 50-day moving average.

""We — and the market — were expecting the Structured Data Initiative to help drive accelerating (gross merchandise volume) growth, but it didn't happen this quarter.""Based on management commentary and fundamental results, it's not likely that GMV will accelerate near-term, given that the company's major initiatives — Structured Data push, Brand Marketing campaign — will take at least a year to play out.""

234,EBAY,"Latin American e-commerce giant MercadoLibre (MELI), as expected, saw its shares fall sharply Thursday after the company announced a big stock sale for its largest shareholder, eBay (EBAY), but the company also preannounced some Q3 numbers that heartened Credit Suisse.The investment bank Thursday raised its price target on MercadoLibre stock by 27%, to 218 from 172, as it expects solid growth for the Argentina-based company's payments subsidiary.IBD'S TAKE: MercadoLibre got a bump in earnings estimates from an analyst, but what top-rated companies have earnings estimates on the rise? You can find that key information on IBD's Rising Profit Estimates list.MercadoLibre shares lost 8.05% to 168.46 in the stock market today, below the key 50-day support line for the first time since late June. Recently, hot IPOs Acacia Communications (ACIA) and Twilio (TWLO) also tumbled on announcements of secondary offerings.Credit Suisse, as well as Cowen & Co., said the pullback was expected given the large number of shares to be sold. EBay is offing 5.5 million of its 8.1 million shares of MercadoLibre, reducing its stake to about 6% from 18%.EBay has held a stake in the Latin American company since 2001, according to Cowen analyst Thomas Champion. EBay stock rose 2% after hours Wednesday and was up 1% early Thursday, though shares were down a fraction Thursday afternoon.""The sale makes sense in our view given: (1) MELI shares have had a strong run of late, +60% YTD (now 47%); and (2) at current prices, eBay could gross about $1 billion from the transaction (less post-tax). which could then be returned to shareholders via the buyback or used for other investment or M&A,"" Champion wrote in a research note late Wednesday. He maintained a market perform rating.But with its prospectus on the offering, MercadoLibre released some early Q3 financial data. It expects revenue of $220 million to $230 million, above Wall Street consensus. Its gross market value (GMV) of items sold of roughly $2 billion meets analyst targets, as does its roughly $2.1 billion in total payment volume (TPV) from its payments unit.It's the first time TPV will exceed GMV, Credit Suisse analysts pointed out in a research report, and ""although this was an inevitability given the larger TAM (total addressable market) for (payments unit) Pago, we believe the 3Q16 result is the beginning of a shift in narrative,"" they wrote. Credit Suisse said the TPV beats estimates, and besides the price target the analysts also bumped up their Q3 estimates.

Proofpoint (PFPT) reports earnings on Oct. 20.Twilio stock plunged after the communications software provider filed to make a secondary stock offering, although it preannounced Q3 revenue above Wall Street consensus estimates and forecast a smaller-than-expected loss. In the offering, Twilio will sell $50 million in stock and existing shareholders will sell a still-undisclosed amount. Mercadolibre (MELI) fell 8% Thursday after announcing plans to sell stock on behalf of eBay (EBAY).Gene-sequencer Illumina late Monday preannounced a big miss for its Q3 revenue, and gave a weak Q4 forecast. Shares plunged 25% the next day, to a five-month low. That follows big warnings on Q3 2015 and Q1 2016. Canaccord Genuity analyst Mark Massaro didn't help Illumina's cause when he said that after speaking with Illumina executives, they were ""still searching for answers to explain the miss."" He said a delayedsale of its high-end HiSeq X5 or X10 genome-sequencing system, likely to a China customer was one reason. These systems can cost $1 million-plus, so the sales cycles are long, often longer than expected. U.S. sales of the company's 2500/4000 line also drove the miss, says Massaro, who calls the weak U.S. outlook ""troubling.""The aluminum giant's Q3 EPS rose 52% to 32 cents, missing forecasts by 3 cents, as revenue dipped 6% to $5.21 billion, below expectations for $5.31 billion. Alcoa (AA) cited weakness in its performance materials business, which will be spun off as a separate publicly traded company next month. Revenue at what will be known as Arconic, which provides engineering and manufacturing services to the aerospace, automobile and commercial transportation markets, slipped 1% in Q3 to $3.4 billion, though after-tax operating profit rose 4% to $267 million. Alcoa shares plunged nearly 16% for the week, diving below their 50- and 200-day averages.

252,EBAY,"EBay (EBAY) stock hit a new high Thursday as Deutsche Bank issued a buy rating and said the e-commerce giant might be the best internet growth story heading into 2017.Deutsche Bank analyst Ross Sandler, in the research report, said he expects eBay to be trading in a range of 40 to 45 within the next 12 months.""EBay presents a great alternative investment idea to the crowded best-of-breed stories that most tech investors have piled into for the past few years,"" Sandler wrote.These best-of-breed companies include Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Facebook (FB).""We think eBay fundamentals are stable in 2016 and should start to improve in 2017,"" with growth rates likely to accelerate, Sandler said.EBay closed up 1.4% at 32.30 in the stock market today. Earlier, eBay hit an all-time high of 33.19, surpassing its prior peak of 32.81 set on Sept. 8.IBD'S Take: EBay sports an IBD Composite Rating of 93, meaning it has outperformed 93% of stocks over the past year. It also has a very strong Accumulation/Distribution Rating of A-, indicating that institutional investors have been snapping up the stock.Sandler said eBay is a rarity in today's market as an ""out-of-favor accelerating-growth stories with upside to estimates and a reasonably low valuation.""He said eBay is coming out of a rough patch that included password breaches in 2014, and a loss of search-engine traffic due to changes at Alphabet's Google. It was also a time when eBay was in the process of spinning of PayPal (PYPL), completed in July 2015. Increased competition and market share losses to Amazon added to the pain.Amazon is the dominant player in several categories such as home and garden, clothing and accessories where eBay historically had strong market share, Sandler wrote.Starting Q1 2014, eBay posted seven straight quarters of year-over-year declines in revenue, but metrics began to improve in Q1 2015.""Over the last two years, the company has done a ton of heavy lifting in fixing these issues, much of which happens behind the scenes and isn't yet showing through in financial performance,"" Sandler wrote.Evidence of the turnaround surfaced when eBay reported second-quarter earnings that included a 6% year-over-year rise in revenue to $2.2 billion. It also issued full-year guidance above the Wall Street consensus estimates, though its Q3 guidance was light.""We don't expect eBay to take market share back from Amazon, but the company has plenty of room to drive share gains from offline retail,"" Sandler wrote.RELATED:How Apple, Amazon, Alibaba Could Disrupt Google's Mobile Ad BusinessStock Indexes Retreat, But eBay Pegs New High

253,EBAY,"Twitter (TWTR) was upgraded, Amazon's (AMZN) price target was raised and Starbucks (SBUX) price target was cut Wednesday.Twitter was upgraded to hold from sell at Loop Capital.The social networking site had been the subject of buyout talks, but its reputation as a forum for nasty comments is a key reason why Walt Disney (DIS) and Salesforce.com (CRM) reportedly backed off making bids for the company.Twitter shares rose 1.4% to close at 17.07 on the stock market today.IBD'S TAKE: Disney might have turned away from a Twitter takeover but it reportedly has its eyes on Netflix. Netflix shares were up 19% on Tuesday, well above its 111.95 buy point on better-than-expected subscriber growth.Amazon's price target was raised to 905 from 847 at Pacific Crest.

255,EBAY,"Let's say you're sitting in a stock that has enjoyed a long winning streak. You're reluctant to sell, despite some signs that the big run is finished. When do you absolutely, positively have to sell?It's at this time that the 200-day moving average (or a 40-week moving average on a weekly chart) comes in handy.A moving average, which calculates a stock's average closing price over a set time period, shows a stock's general price direction. The 50-day and 200-day moving averages are widely used indicators of intermediate and long-term trends, respectively.The 200-day average is found by adding the closing prices of the last 200 sessions and dividing by 200, then repeated the next trading day. Doing that creates a line that puts a stock's day-to-day action into context and helps to identify long-term support.Most investors sell when a stock breaches the 50-day line in high volume. In many cases, they're not sitting on a big enough profit to risk further loss of hard-earned gains. But investors who have already racked up big returns have more flexibility.MercadoLibre (MELI) broke out above a 27.52 buy point in a cup-with-handle base on July 15, 2009, in heavy volume. The stock had a compelling story as the eBay of Latin America, an online marketplace for the region's increasingly wealthy population. Fundamentals on the day of the breakout were stellar — a 99 Composite Rating, a 91 EPS Rating and a 92 Relative Strength.Most investors probably would have sold when the stock sliced through its 10-week line in huge volume on Jan. 11, 2010 (1). But those who truly liked the stock's long-term growth potential may have decided to wait until it breached the 40-week line in big volume. After all, they were still sitting on a profit of more than 50% despite the sharp slide.The stock went on to form new bases and hit new highs, punctuated by sharp drops to support at the 40-week moving average (2). The stock peaked at 92.73 in the week ended April 29, 2011, representing a gain of 337%.The final sell signal came during the week ended Aug. 5, 2011, when the stock finally plunged through the 40-week line in heavy volume (3). Those who sold would have locked in a gain of 258%. By October that year, shares fell as much as 48% below their 52-week peak of 92.73.(Editor's Note: This column originally published in the May 10, 2013, edition of IBD.)RELATED:Time To Sell: When Your Stock Rebounds In Weak Trade After Big-Volume Sell-offDo You Know How To Draw A Proper Trend Line To Capture Good Sell Signals?

256,EBAY,"PayPal Holdings (PYPL) is expected to report a 13% rise in EPS ex items, on a 17% rise in revenue, when its reports Q3 results after the close Thursday. Analysts will also be looking for management commentary on the payment processor's partnerships with credit-card networks Visa (V) and MasterCard (MA).Visa on Monday announced that CEO Charles Scharf will step down. He'll be succeeded by former American Express (AXP) President Alfred Kelly. PayPal stock fell after the Visa deal was announced in July, but shares have rebounded heading into the Q3 earnings report and are up 9% in 2016.PayPal stock finished the trading day up 0.9% to 39.83 on the stock market today.IBD'S TAKE: EBay spun off PayPal in 2015. Despite a choppy trading history since going it alone, PayPal is in the IBD Big Cap 20, stocks that should be less volatile than most but still have good growth prospects.Analysts have been seeking more information on how terms of the Visa and MasterCard deals could impact 2017 margins and EPS. The MasterCard deal was announced in September. Analysts are also looking for clarity on how the Visa and MasterCard deals differ.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Q3 earnings per share minus items of 35 cents, on revenue of $2.65 billion. The year-over-year percentage increases would both top Q2 results.PayPal faces more competition from Apple Pay, Apple's (AAPL) mobile wallet, and Google Android-based payment systems, including Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google Wallet.""A big misconception in the PayPal story is that competition from the large smartphone operators will eventually take share, impacting PayPal negatively in the long term,"" said Bradley Berning, a Craig-Hallum Capital analyst, in a research report.

258,EBAY,"Most of the morning gains vanished in the major indexes Friday, although they were off session lows as Amazon.com (AMZN) was one of the few highlights among leading stocks.The Nasdaq and S&P 500 were up 0.3% but had been up as much as 0.9%. Curiously, the Nasdaq started falling once it reached its 50-day moving average, a key indicator from which the tech-heavy composite index has fallen below this week.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.5%. Its components were about evenly mixed. Intel (INTC) rose  more than 1% as shares continued to rise from support near the 50-day moving average.

The company announced it had forged a partnership with VMware (VMW) on cloud computing. The pact creates a stronger rival to Microsoft (MSFT) in the enterprise market, analysts noted. VMware shares were down slightly as the stock continued work on a new base with a 77.09 buy point. Microsoft added 1%.MercadoLibre (MELI) continued to slide, down 0.5% after Thursday's 8% sell-off. The stock has broken below its 50-day moving average  in heavy volume, a sell signal.Shares of the Latin America online marketplace were rocked by news that eBay (EBAY) is cutting its stake in MercadoLibre to about 6% from 18%. Also Thursday, Credit Suisse raised its price target on MercadoLibre to 218 from 172, making bullish comments on the company's payments subsidiary.Some bank stocks that were up earlier on earnings erased their gains. Wells Fargo (WFC) beat profit views, but reversed lower. JPMorgan (JPM), which also topped estimates, wiped clean a 2% gain and was flat. Citigroup (C), another that surpassed estimates, erased a 3% early lead.Still, the actively traded SPDR Financial (XLF) ETF rose 0.6% in a new bid to reclaim the 50-day line.RELATED:Wells Fargo Beats But New Checking Accounts Sink; JPMorgan, Citi TopMercadoLibre Gets Big Price-Target Hike As Stock Falls On Stock SaleAmazon To Gain In Enterprise Vs.

276,EBAY,"Argentina-based e-commerce company MercadoLibre (MELI) delivered a strong earnings report late Thursday despite the slow Latin American economy, sending the stock soaring to an all-time high Friday.Latin America's No. 1 e-commerce company reported Q2 revenue of $199.6 million, up 29% year over year and up 73% in local currency, beating the Wall Street consensus estimate of $180 million.MercadoLibre reported adjusted earnings per share of 74 cents, up 68% year over year and beating the consensus of 59 cents.The company, dubbed ""the eBay (EBAY) of Latin America,"" said it sold 43.7 million items in Q2, a 45% year-over-year jump and its highest growth since 2009. Growth was primarily driven by Brazil and Argentina, where sales rose 57% and 46%, respectively. Gross merchandise volume topped $2 billion, up 21% in dollars and higher by 68% in local currency.MercadoLibre's U.S.-listed stock soared by 13.6% to 172.98 at the close on the stock market today. But that's greatly extended from a cup-with-handle breakout, at a 130.72 buy point on May 6, past the point where investors are advised to lock in at least some profit.IBD'S TAKE: Since hitting a 14-month low of 84.19 on Feb. 9, MarcadoLibre is up 92% and is extended beyond buy range. MercadoLibre has a solid IBD Composite Rating of 95, with 99 being the highest.Just last week, however, a United Nations panel said Latin America's economy will contract 0.8% this year, where in April it had forecast just a 0.2% contraction. The Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean said Latin America was being dragged down by its heavyweights -- Brazil, Argentina and Venezuela.The opening ceremonies for the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro are Friday, but the event has been marred by cost overruns, fear of crime and the Zika virus, and observers are uncertain of the games' economic impact.Cowen analyst Thomas Champion, however, says MercadoLibre had shrugged off those troubles, as e-commerce continues to gain in developing nations.Champion raised his price target on MercadoLibre's U.S. stock to 165 from 150, maintaining a market perform rating.""MercadoLibre management is executing extremely well and the macroeconomy is having little (or no) impact on results,"" Champion wrote in a research note.The company operates in Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Chile, Colombia and 11 other markets in Latin America.

277,EBAY,"As sometimes with a baseball trade, it's too early to know who got the best of Visa's (V) agreement with PayPal (PYPL), though it could be a win-win for both.Visa and PayPal late Thursday announced a wide-ranging partnership, easing tension between the online payment processor and credit card network.""We expect to see many opinions that proclaim this is favorable to Visa or to PayPal -- but the fact is that it is too early to tell,"" Citigroup analyst Ashwin Shirvaikar said in a research report.Mizuho Securities analyst Neil Doshi says the deal helps PayPal.""We view the enhanced partnership with Visa as a strong positive, as it quickly allows PayPal to scale to retail locations and also reduces the threat that PayPal could be singled out by Visa,"" he wrote in a research note. ""But we think this will increase transaction expense in 2017, and PayPal may have to offer similar deals with MasterCard (MA) and American Express (AXP).""Visa stock closed up 1.4% in the stock market today, while PayPal stock -- which had risen in after-hours trading Thursday after the deal's announcement and an earnings beat -- fell 6.8%. PayPal and Visa late Thursday each posted June-quarter EPS that beat Wall Street views.PayPal's online checkout service has used an automated clearing house (ACH) system set up by bank partners, bypassing credit card companies. PayPal's online payment system will no longer steer customers away from Visa's credit card network, and Visa cards will be a payment option for PayPal users.PayPal will receive economic incentives, including Visa incentives for increased volume.""While PayPal reported Q2 revenues above expectations, in-line EPS, and raised revenue guidance, we believe that the agreement with Visa will be the main driver to near-term stock price performance,"" said RBC Capital analyst Daniel Perlin, in a report.IBD'S TAKE: PayPal stock is up about 11% so far in 2016. Learn more at IBD Stock Checkup. PayPal could be acquired, some analysts have speculated, though the company has said it's not up for sale.PayPal will gain access to Visa's ""tokenization services,"" starting in the U.S., for in-store transactions. Visa and Mastercard have developed security technology that replaces the 16-digit account numbers in credit cards. Tokens are essentially electronic security keys. Visa launched the service on Apple (AAPL) devices in 2014. Visa also has been working with online retailers.""The (Visa deal) clearly opens the door for contactless payments using PayPal, and that could create a lot of different possibilities,"" said Thad Peterson, an analyst at Aite Group.PayPal, spun off from eBay (EBAY) a year ago, and the credit card networks are both eyeing mobile payments, where rivals include Apple Pay, Apple's mobile wallet.

280,EBAY,"Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) was hit with a downgrade by Wedbush on views that Apple (AAPL), Amazon.com (AMZN), eBay, Alibaba Group (BABA) and others could disrupt its fast-growing mobile advertising business.James Dix, an analyst at Wedbush, downgraded Google to underperform, with a price target of 700.Dix says Apple, Amazon, eBay (EBAY) and Alibaba are among companies that can use their e-commerce or digital payment systems to get in the way of Google's advertising-based search business.Apple has filed patent applications for a digital wallet service that would pay users to view advertisements, notes Dix in his research report. Many consumers search for products on Amazon's website rather than initially searching on Google, he noted.""For products where Amazon and eBay do a lot of business, they have essentially usurped the top spot as the place for commercial searches from Google … . (T)hey might well consider adding paid attention features,"" said Dix. ""Alibaba, whose largest revenue source is advertising, has highlighted the potential profitability from the convergence between advertising and commerce.""Google stock edged down a small fraction, to 810.06, in the stock market today.IBD'S TAKE: Google stock has been in a trading range since it reported Q2 earnings and has failed to break out amid views it faces tough year-over-year comparisons after launching new ad products in Q3 2015. Amazon is an IBD Leaderboard stock, while Alibaba belongs to the IBD 50.The Wedbush report says ad blockers, credit-card companies, marketing communications services firms, rewards platforms and telecom operators also could steer consumers away from Google's search engine.""We see the risk to Google's mobile search advertising more in terms of competition from other platforms and business models than from more direct search advertising competitors,"" Dix wrote.RELATED:Stocks Up, Alibaba Rallies Again; Why Amazon.com Continues To Lead

284,EBAY,"Apple (AAPL) iPhones are drubbing Samsung and other Android rivals in the Bring Your Own Device race to provide ""bulletproof security,"" says Tech Research Pro.Yet, good security often, if not usually, is lacking on employee-owned mobile devices used in the workplace, a Tech Research Pro survey found and other sources say.Of 259 respondents in a Tech Research Pro survey in April and May of decision makers in companies worldwide, 76% said their companies let employees use personal smartphones for business but only a third of IT departments support these devices, and employees aren't too security conscious.""Enterprise security breaches reported by respondents also reflected a tendency on the part of employees to take a more relaxed attitude toward security on their mobile devices,"" Tech Research Pro said in its report.The BYOD trend is important for Apple and Samsung, which see the enterprise sector as a growth opportunity amid overall slowing smartphone growth, says ZDNet and TechRepublic editor Larry Dignan. Corporate information technology units are trying to respond.Industry tracker Forrester recently found that more than half of all corporations are developing BOYD programs. Still, 1 in 3 decision makers polled by Tech Research Pro said their IT departments support only company-provided smartphones, tablets, wearables and laptops.Apple is leading Microsoft (MSFT) and Samsung in usage of tablets and wearables; it's leading Microsoft, Lenovo, Dell and  HP Inc. (HPQ) in laptops; and it beats Samsung in smartphones, according to Tech Pro Research. Apple's lead is partly on the opinion that it's more secure, Dignan told IBD.In the Tech Research Pro survey, more than half of respondents (51%) rated the iPhone as ""good or excellent in security."" Only 30% said the same for Samsung, though the company is closing the gap with its Knox mobile security app, says Tech Research Pro.The gap in actual usage is smaller -- 67% were using Apple vs. 62% using Samsung -- meaning some users could be trading lesser security for lower device costs, since Apple devices often cost more than others.BlackBerry (BBRY) also dominated Samsung in terms of security perception -- 39% rated its security as ""good or excellent."" And Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google is also pushing for the enterprise segment, Dignan says.Still, the halo effect of Apple's security pays real dividends.""From the start, Apple has had good security built in,"" Dignan told IBD. ""It doesn't have the fragmentation that Android has. It's hard to protect Android, which has different versions, flavors and eight different operating systems vs. one iOS.""Apple's security reputation stems in part on its tight control of its App Store and requirements for installing apps, says Ryan Kalember, Proofpoint (PFPT) senior vice president of cybersecurity strategy.""The iOS devices, for a very long time, were considered more or less bulletproof from a security perspective, unless they were jailbroken,"" Kalember told IBD. Jailbreaking an Apple device escalates a user's privileges, allowing third-party apps not approved by the App Store to be installed.Many security professionals consider jailbreaking an opening to a Pandora's box. Such was the case when a hacker created Ex Code Ghost, mimicking Apple's Ex Code app which developers use to create legitimate apps. The Ghost version was uploaded near the end of 2015 and allowed apps to be created, but it inserted malicious code after the fact.Apple identified the offending code, but not before it penetrated 1,100 legitimate apps in the official App Store, including the app for Chinese Uber rival Didi Chuxing Technology, a ride-hailing service.""It was cleaned up, but it was a very a clever way to puncture the illusion that, just if you had iOS only and no jailbroken devices, then you were safe from a security perspective,"" Kalember said.Soon after, Proofpoint discovered another vulnerability shadowing Apple's security illusion -- Dark Side Loader, a fraudulent app store that clones legitimate apps by stealing certificates. Dark Side Loader takes advantage of an Apple mechanism that allows companies to create and upload their own apps to a private store for employees.But Dark Side Loader uses it to peddle free versions of paid apps, allowing Apple users to circumvent the official app store. Kalember likens it to Napster for apps, which is troubling because ""Apple never reviews that app ... like Apple does for every app in the enterprise store.""Still, Apple shines in the Tech Research Pro security survey. The lion's share of respondents (82%) rated Apple's iPad security ""good or excellent,"" vs. 77% and 73% for Microsoft and Samsung, respectively. In wearables, 65% rated Apple's security highly to 58% for both Microsoft and Samsung.Also, 42% felt Apple's MacBooks have excellent security, while only a third said the same for Microsoft. Dell, HP and Lenovo trailed at 30%, 29% and 27%, respectively.The BYOD trend kicked off in earnest less than a decade ago, but it's already entrenched. Of respondents to the Tech Research Pro survey, only 2% said there is absolutely no use of personal mobile devices -- smartphones, laptops, tablets and wearables -- in their workplaces.To that end, Forrester Research found that 60% of corporate decision makers plan to invest heavily in mobile application development before year's end. CNBC reported recently that Target (TGT), Walgreens (WAG), Amazon.com (AMZN) and eBay (EBAY) are leading the pack in developing mobile apps for their employees.But employees are the weak link in security, Tech Research Pro found. Only 12% of those surveyed had experienced a breach in the past year, but of those, 57% cited a lost device and 23% lack of data encryption on the employee's device.That extended to sharing the device and/or the data with unauthorized people within and outside the company.Nearly every laptop (96%) was password-protected, along with 89% of tablets, 85% of smartphones and 57% of wearables, researchers found.But less than half of all devices required data encryption or central management. Laptops are most likely to be encrypted (47%), but only 38% of smartphones and 36% of tablets are protected similarly, says Tech Research Pro.Mobile device management (MDM), which can remotely push updates or lock down a misplaced device, was used on 48% of laptops, 47% of tablets and 44% of smartphones. Wearables trailed in every security regard. Less than a third are protected by encryption or mobile device management.Wearables are just entering the workplace, though. Of those surveyed, 94% were using smartphones and laptops, 74% were using tablets and only 14% were using wearables. BYOD wearables were most prevalent in the military, law enforcement, health care, field maintenance and sports sectors, Tech Research Pro found.Usage has a part to play on security perception. Respondents ranked laptop security highest with tablets, smartphones and wearables trailing, respectively. This likely stems from the ability to track down a lost or stolen device, researchers said, which is why desktops are considered the most secure devices.BYOD security is an overwhelmingly mobile target, Proofpoint's Kalember says. IT departments are still inking their policies, which is why only the savvier companies require higher levels of protection like MDM and mobile threat protection, he told IBD.More stringent IT departments might install MDMs that scan for rogue apps, Kalember said. The tech team can lock a user out of corporate email and/or apps until the offending app is uninstalled. But IT departments employing such tactics are early adopters, he says.""The typical thing we see for most BYOD is that the IT department has a primitive understanding of an employee blacklist, and it's to avoid employee time-wasting,"" he said. ""They might install a mobile device management tool to prohibit employees from installing 'Angry Birds' or 'Pokemon Go.' ""

285,EBAY,"What started as a joke by college students has become the single biggest online shopping day in China, thanks to Alibaba Group (BABA).Chinese youths had picked Nov. 11 as a day for people who are single to celebrate, calling it 11.11, or Singles Day. Alibaba adopted and promoted the theme in 2009, and gave it the name the 11.11 Global Shopping Festival. It has since evolved into a day when, single or not, consumers in China buy gifts and celebrate.Coming up again in a few weeks, it is the single-largest shopping day of the year at Alibaba. On the last 11.11, Alibaba said that it recorded $14.3 billion in sales transactions across its various e-commerce websites on Singles Day, far surpassing the $9.3 billion it logged on the 2014 holiday. That $14.3 billion translates roughly to $357 million in revenue for the company.Singles Day also has become a bonanza for Alibaba competitors' JD.com (JD), Tencent Holdings (TCEHY), Baidu (BIDU) and other China Internet companies. But none are at the level of Alibaba, which is China's largest e-commerce company by transactions and customers served.Case in point: In April, Alibaba said it was on a path to realizing its vision of achieving $1 trillion in annual gross merchandise volume in about four years, as it also pursues a goal of reaching 2 billion consumers on its e-commerce platforms.""The scale of Alibaba is staggering,"" said David Spitz, chief executive of ChannelAdvisor, an e-commerce software company.Still, there is room for Alibaba and other China internet companies to grow. China has the largest number of internet and smartphone users worldwide, and yet only half the population is online.It's a big reason why Alibaba received a spate of analyst upgrades following its quarterly earnings report on Aug. 11 that crushed views and sent the stock to an 18-month high.For its fiscal first quarter ended June 30, Alibaba said revenue rose 59% year-over-year to $4.84 billion, maintaining a stretch of double-digit gains going back more than four years. It was Alibaba's fastest growth since its IPO two years ago. Earnings per share rose 33%.Among the key stats in the earnings report, mobile monthly active users surged 39% to 427 million. Alibaba said mobile monetization rates exceeded nonmobile revenue sources for the first time. Mobile revenue rose 119% year over year, accounting for 75% of Alibaba's total China retail revenue, compared with 51% in the year-earlier quarter.In the earnings report, Alibaba for the first time provided disclosures on the performance of its cloud-computing business, in addition to various digital media and entertainment assets and other long-term strategic bets.""Some of these new businesses are already building strong traction,"" said Joseph Tsai, Alibaba executive vice chairman, in the earnings conference call.In particular, Tsai cited Alibaba's nascent cloud-computing business, where revenue grew 156% year-over-year to $187 million. Its customer count doubled to 577,000.Last week Stifel analyst Scott Devitt raised his price target on Alibaba to 125 from 104 and maintained a buy rating.""In the past we have seen improving investor sentiment when large cap internet franchises provided increased segment detail,"" Devitt said, pointing to what Amazon.com (AMZN) did with its Amazon Web Services cloud computing unit, and Alphabet (GOOGL), which gave more detail on smaller businesses the company is testing out.""We believe Alibaba's shares may follow similar trends to those of Amazon and Alphabet following new disclosures as investors gain more visibility into the company's path to grow the various components of its global commerce ecosystem,"" Devitt wrote.IBD'S TAKE: Alibaba is trading at its highest level since December 2014 and is sharply extended from the 85.10 cup-with-handle buy point set on Aug. 9. It's an IBD Leaderboard stock that sports an IBD Composite Rating of 99, the highest possible, and a strong Accumulation/Distribution Rating of A, indicating institutional investors have snapped up the stock. MKM Partners analyst Ron Sanderson last week reiterated a buy rating with a price target of 130, saying he was ""enthusiastically bullish"" on the company after meeting with management. He thinks Alibaba will be the best performing large-cap in the internet sector over the next 12 months.Among analysts polled by Thomson Reuters, 14 have a strong buy rating on Alibaba, 20 say buy, three say hold and one sell. Shares were down fractionally Monday to close at 105.38.A fierce battle is taking place between Alibaba and JD.com in e-commerce, though the companies use different strategies. JD has a business model similar to Amazon. JD manages its own inventory and delivery logistics.Alibaba, meanwhile, serves as an intermediary between buyers and sellers, who themselves manage the delivery. It gets a cut from the sale of goods on its platforms, known as its monetization rate, or about 2.4% of gross merchandise sold.Alibaba was founded in 1999 in Hangzhou, China, but didn't gain widespread recognition until its blockbuster initial public offering in September 2014. It was the largest IPO ever, raising about $25 billion.Its beginnings were in the e-commerce field. Alibaba's two core e-commerce platforms, which account for a majority of revenue, are Tmall and Taobao. Tmall is China's largest business-to-consumer platform, which retailers worldwide use to establish online stores. Taobao is a consumer-to-consumer business similar to eBay.Alibaba has since expanded into multiple facets of a digital economy. It's engaged in digital entertainment and movies, financial services, cloud computing and Big Data analytics, among other businesses.What Alibaba did extremely well was to put a big focus on mobile. Consumers with mobile devices now account for 75% of revenue generated through Alibaba's various e-commerce platforms.""For the most part China skipped the desktop and went straight to mobile,"" said ChannelAdvisor's Spitz. ""Given that mobile was the primary way Chinese consumers went online, that favored product aggregators like Alibaba from the outset.""Alibaba has been investing heavily to grow the company. Last year Alibaba invested about $11 billion in acquisitions. This includes $4.63 billion for a 20% stake in Suning, one of the largest consumer-electronics retail chains in China.The investment in Suning is part of a plan, also embraced by Baidu, JD and Tencent, to ramp up their online-to-offline, or O2O, retailing. O2O is expected to figure heavily in the future of retailing and consumption in China. It's seen as a better way for China's consumers to research and buy goods and receive them quickly, with smartphones playing a key role.In April Alibaba said it was investing $1.9 billion in two deals, holding firm to its strategy of growth through acquisition and boosting local services in China. Alibaba said it will invest $900 million into Shanghai-based Ele.me, a leading online food-delivery company. It also acquired a controlling stake in Singapore-based Lazada, a leading e-commerce platform in Southeast Asia, for an investment valued at $1 billion.Alibaba also paid $3.7 billion acquire the rest of Youku Tudou, referred to as China's YouTube, which it didn't already own.For Alibaba to reach its long-term goals, it will need to grab market share internationally, which it is starting to do, Spitz said.""It remains to be seen if Alibaba can replicate their success outside of China,"" he said. As it pushes offshore Alibaba is most likely to spar with Amazon, which dominates the U.S. market in the same way Alibaba does China.""They are two extraordinary well run companies with very long-term horizons,"" said Spitz. ""When those two start to overlap geographies it will be interesting to watch closely to see how they compete.""RELATED:Stocks Up, Alibaba Rallies Again; Why Amazon.com Continues To LeadChina's Internet Giants Boldly Move Into New YearJD.com Q2 Earnings Top Views But Revenue Guidance Falls Short How Apple, Amazon, Alibaba Could Disrupt Google's Mobile Ad BusinessTencent Earnings: Revenue Growth Fastest In Years On WeChat, Mobile Gaming

288,EBAY,"Argentina-based e-commerce company MercadoLibre (MELI) surged to an all-time high Friday as JPMorgan upgraded the stock to overweight from neutral and set a price target of 200.MercadoLibre stock rose 7.2% to 186.16 in the stock market today. The stock has jumped more than 60% this year.JPMorgan analyst Andre Baggio, in a research note, said MercadoLibre is reaping the benefits of its enhanced marketplace, which combines payments and shipping to enhance the buyer experience and boost activity.

It reported Q2 revenue of $199.6 million, up 29% year over year and up 73% in local currency, and its biggest growth in 10 quarters.

Bradley Berning, a Craig-Hallum analyst, set a price target of 52 on the online payment processor's stock.""PayPal already has about 30% market share of U.S. e-commerce payment volume and we believe that will increase to 35% by 2020,"" said Berning in a research report.IBD'S TAKE: PayPal stock is trading above its 50-day moving average, a positive trend. The payment processor has an IBD Composite Rating of 92 out of a possible 99. Learn more at IBD Stock Checkup.Berning says Apple (AAPL) Pay is less of a threat to PayPal than some analysts claim. He says PayPal's acquisition of Braintree in 2013 was a key step in building a mobile payments platform.He expects a boost for PayPal from recent deals with Visa (V) and MasterCard (MA). Berning expects PayPal to disclose more details on the financial impact of the credit card network deals.""A big misconception in the PayPal story is that competition from the large smartphone operators will eventually take share, impacting PayPal negatively in the long term,"" said Berning in the report. ""We believe the opposite. Competitive mobile payment solutions, most notably Apple Pay, will drive adoption and lift all boats.""PayPal was spun off from eBay (EBAY) in 2015. PayPal has 180 million users globally.""PayPal's key differentiator is its compatibility with every mobile OS, hardware, and browser. PayPal will also accept funds from any credit issuer on any card network or directly with a bank,"" added Berning. ""There is no other digital wallet in the market today capable of mobile, peer to peer, point of sale, in-app, online and remittance payments, with the ability to store funds and transmit money between both debit and credit accounts.""PayPal stock closed up 2.2% at 40.83 in the stock market today, hitting the highest level in more than four months.RELATED:Who Got Best Of Visa-PayPal Deal?

292,EBAY,"European officials must be frustrated. Since the founding of the internet, they have failed to launch a major tech company except perhaps Spotify.Meanwhile, the United States has produced some of the world's best known tech companies including Airbnb, Amazon.com, Apple, eBay, Facebook, Google, Instagram, Microsoft, Netflix, Pandora, Periscope, Snapchat, Travelocity, Trip Advisor, Twitter, Uber, Wikipedia, Yelp, Zappos and Zynga.It didn't have to be this way.Several years ago, while waiting to speak at a European conference on innovation, I heard a top government official urge his colleagues to leapfrog the Americans by encouraging entrepreneurship, relaxing regulations and promoting science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) education at the high school level, as well as English proficiency. He was followed by a government minister who suggested a different approach: attacking big American tech companies using new legal arguments.Clearly, European Union officials have chosen the latter path and accelerated their efforts to extort, restrict and damage successful American tech companies. Over the last two decades, European regulators have investigated and challenged Google, Amazon, Intel, Facebook, Microsoft and Qualcomm, among others.The late August announcement by Margrethe Vestager, European commissioner for Violation of EU Treaties, that the EU will seek $14.5 billion from Apple in back taxes is an unprecedented act of economic aggression against not only Apple, but more broadly the United States. Apple says it followed the law and paid the taxes it owed to Ireland — to the tune of $400 million annually.And the tech company isn't the only global target in the EU's sights. The EC is also going after Starbucks, Amazon and McDonald's for supposed tax avoidance.The European Commission's (EC) move has rightly enraged top Democrats and Republicans in the States. Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., called it a ""cheap money grab"" by the EC, ""targeting U.S. businesses and the U.S. tax base."" House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said, ""This is precisely the kind of unpredictable and heavy-handed taxation that kills jobs and opportunity."" And Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., worries the action may ""set a dangerous precedent that … paints a target on American firms in the eyes of foreign governments.""Put another way, the EC's order is like California and New York seeking back taxes from citizens who moved to Nevada and Florida 10 years earlier — even though the latter two states say those citizens have paid their taxes in full.The EU's war on innovative U.S. tech companies extends far beyond tax structures. France's data protection authority requires search engines such as Google to remove links to factual stories online if a person named in the stories asserts the ""right to be forgotten."" Google also faces restrictions on displaying printed media sources in search results. Netflix is being told it must finance European films. Facebook and others are being attacked over bogus privacy issues. Amazon is being investigated over e-book antitrust concerns. Uber faces legal roadblocks in several countries including France and Germany.EU officials have decided to attack rather than compete. They are stuck defending European socialism, restricting the agility that tech companies require to thrive. Companies face excessive challenges in firing EU employees, even if the company wants to shift its lines of business or move its locations. Many worker benefits are mandatory. Vacations last weeks — many businesses shut down for the month of August. Unions seem to disrupt commerce and travel on a daily basis. Even sending emails after normal work hours can violate the law.European citizens don't necessarily want this. British citizens voted to leave the EU in part because of the broad, onerous and often senseless rules the EU imposed on businesses.Not every European official agrees with this approach. France's pro-business Economic Minister Emmanuel Macron, who resigned his post in August possibly to consider a presidential run, has challenged the short workweek and restrictions on Uber. This year, he led a delegation of over 100 French innovators to our recent Las Vegas CES — the Global Stage for Innovation.To build businesses and foster innovation, the EU must rethink its approach to regulation. Its economy has grown by a meager 1.9%, compared to the relatively robust 2.4% GDP growth in the U.S.The EU is losing a strong and steady force in Great Britain. Now it could lose Ireland. Even its one big success story, Spotify, is considering relocating from Sweden to the U.S. because the company feels it can no longer attract the best and brightest workers, given the political obstacles it faces in Sweden.Growth doesn't come from outlandish legal attacks on competition — it comes from encouraging new businesses, deregulation and innovation. It's time for the EU to change its outlook on innovation, or else face the withering consequences of stagnation.

295,EBAY,"Just a year ago, Travis Kalanick told anyone who would listen that China was Uber Technologies' most pivotal market. He's now waved the white flag.Uber is about to join a lengthening list of U.S. companies that have stumbled in the world's largest internet market, from Yahoo (YHOO) to eBay (EBAY). It's capitulating via a deal that will see arch-foe Didi Chuxing buy out its local business to create a $35 billion Chinese ride-share leader, according to people familiar with the matter. Uber and its backers will be left with about a 20% economic stake in the enlarged local player, Didi said.The deal is the culmination of more than a year of take-no-prisoners war between the world's two largest ride-sharing companies, a series of clashes played out in the media and on the dusty streets of hundreds of cities. That battle, waged through massive subsidies on rides, wound up costing Uber $2 billion, the people said. Alarmed, its investors clamored for a ceasefire.In the end, Didi proved too resourceful -- and too well-connected -- for the ride-sharing giant to dethrone. Uber threw in the towel just days after China banned the practice of charging less than the cost of a ride, depriving the U.S. company of a tried-and-true engagement tactic. In a blogpost obtained by Bloomberg before an official announcement, Kalanick portrayed the deal as a merger that strengthens both parties; others, including Grab CEO Anthony Tan, saw it as a humbled Uber taking its ball elsewhere.""The road to China has been littered by corpses of foreign technology companies that have tried to operate here unsuccessfully,"" said  Zennon Kapron, managing director of Shanghai-based consulting firm Kapronasia. ""This could be viewed as a setback for Uber, but it could have been much worse.""Didi has locked horns with Uber since its creation last year through the merger of startups backed by Tencent Holdings (TCEHY) and Alibaba Group (BABA), the country's top internet firms. The need to repel Uber, which was starting to ramp up its service, helped drive the two into each others' arms. The Chinese company held a near-monopoly on taxi-hailing but private-car booking -- Uber's forte -- remained up for grabs.It was the Chinese firm that fired the first salvo: In May of 2015, it announced it would give away 1 billion yuan ($150 million) in free rides. Uber refused to back down, responding with its own subsidies. Kalanick, who became a regular fixture on the Beijing conference circuit, including at Baidu World, rallied investors to stay the course. In June, he penned a letter to investors pledging to invest $1 billion in the market that year alone.Over the summer of last year, both sides raced to attract the cash needed to bankroll their contest. Uber raised about $1.4 billion, including from search giant Baidu (BIDU). Didi ended up raising about $3 billion at the time from Alibaba, Tencent, Japan's SoftBank (SFTBY) and Ping An Insurance. The dueling subsidies grew so large it fomented a cottage industry of scammers who figured out how to cash in on the largesse through fake bookings -- without giving anyone a ride.But Didi proved more creative, and local connections came through. The conflict took an unusual turn as third parties began to get drawn into the mix. In August, Uber complained it had been blocked from WeChat, the popular messaging service run by Didi-backer Tencent. Then Didi recruited allies, forging a four-way alliance with ride-sharing services that compete with Uber, including Lyft in the U.S., Grab and India's Ola.Didi gained confidence as it entered the new year. From President Jean Liu on down, its executives were determined to deal a knockout blow. Didi began raising more money and its emboldened executives openly declared victory.""We will be the last one standing,"" Stephen Zhu, vice president of strategy, said in what proved to be a prescient April address.Recent funding saw Uber's valuation swell to $68 billion and the company said it had access to more than $11 billion on its balance sheet. Didi, said to be valued at close to $28 billion, had more than $10 billion at its disposal.In the end, Didi proved too large an opponent, with backers including some of China's largest government institutions and even Apple (AAPL). The four-year-old company now handles more than 11 million rides a day and serves about 300 million users across some 400 cities, offering taxis, private cars, ride sharing and test driving.Questions now surround Uber's next move. Does it double-down in India and Southeast Asia against Grab and Ola, the Didis of their respective arenas? Both markets remain relatively under-penetrated and Uber needs to establish a beach-head in Asia to sustain growth. And it's assured of a foothold in China by dint of its slice of Didi. The two companies even share an uncommon bond: Liu is cousin to senior Uber China executive Liu Zhen.By shedding its losses in China, the move may clear Uber's path to an eventual initial public offering. And as part of its deal, Kalanick joins Didi's board -- literally gaining a seat at the table as the effort to dominate the world's largest ride-sharing arena unfolds.So never count Uber out, at least on a global level, said Andy Mok, managing director at Red Pagoda Resources in Beijing.""They want to be a Cisco (CSCO) of the physical world, the network that routes physical people and objects,"" said Mok. ""In a way, this frees up space for more technology development.""

301,EBAY,"For almost a century Radio Shack served electronics enthusiasts as an inexpensive way to buy the goods and parts they needed, from camera accessories and headphone jacks to battery testers and spare power cords for your iPhone.When the company went bankrupt last year, the reaction was shock mingled with a sense of nostalgic sorrow. The media offered all kinds of answers to the mystery of what or who killed Radio Shack, from a bad business model and poor management at the top, to competition from internet suppliers who also killed Circuit City and almost did the same to Best Buy.But in this case the real online perpetrator may be China, a serial predator who's been claiming more victims than just Radio Shack. Even worse, Congress and our own U.S. Postal Service seem to be holding the murder weapon.To get to the bottom of this mystery, we need to remember that Radio Shack's most loyal customers were buyers of small electronics parts for DIY projects -- whether they bought them in the store or from Radio Shack's website.Clue: That's the same line of business that China e-commerce specializes in, with dozens of websites for small cheap goods -- including electronics.Now, everyone loves healthy competition. But Chinese e-commerce companies get a special break, thanks to the USPS and the global cartel that oversees all international shipping by government post, the Universal Postal Union -- a United Nations agency.The UPU sets international postal rates from country to country, i.e. what a country's postal service charges to deliver a package within that country. That rate is based that nation's state of economic development. Category 3 country Gabon, for example, gets a bigger price break on the postage for the packages it ships to Norway, than Norway gets shipping to Gabon -- or to the United States, another Category 1 country. For reasons that defy logic, China, the world's second-biggest economy, also sits in Category 3, alongside Botswana and Cuba -- and Gabon.This means someone in China can send a package across the Pacific to the U.S. and have the USPS deliver anywhere in the 48 states, often for less than an American has to pay to send the same package within the U.S. How did this affect Radio Shack? A quick comparison of its online catalog with those of its Chinese competitors provides fresh evidence of what's happening -- and not just to Radio Shack.For example, a standard multimeter for measuring electric voltage sells from Radio Shack for $24.99. Go to Deal Extreme, a Chinese e-commerce company, and you can buy virtually the same multimeter for $15.82. Throw in Deal Extreme's free shipping (since the terminal dues it pays are so low) versus the $5.95 Radio Shack has to tack on, and a multimeter from Deal Extreme costs you just $15.82, while Radio Shack charges $30.94 -- more than double.Of course, that lower price does reflect cheaper manufacturing costs in China. But take the example of a USB flash drive that sells for $11.99 on the Radio Shack website and almost the identical drive for only a dollar more ($12.99) at another Chinese website, DinoDirect. Yet thanks again to free shipping, DinDirect can sell its flash drive to a U.S. customer at $12.99, while U.S. shipping costs drive Radio Shack's price up to $17.94.The skewing of the e-commerce playing field doesn't stop there. Take a soldering iron for electronics that actually costs less from Radio Shack than from the Chinese website DHGate: $14.99 versus $17.53.   The discriminating customer, however, soon notices that with DHGate's free shipping he will only pay $17.53 getting his device from China, instead of the $20.94 he'd have to pay Radio Shack when shipping inside the U.S. is added in.Now, the Radio Shack customer doesn't always pay shipping. For orders over $30 shipping is free, as well as for orders over 2 kilograms. But Radio Shack's business model for staying in business depended on those 2-kg-or-less orders, the staple of their DYI electronics geek customer base. Those customers easily used their iPads to find websites that delivered the same for less. Thanks to the UPU's convoluted rules, many if not all of those websites originate in China.So did the UPU really kill Radio Shack? Certainly the circumstantial evidence suggests that allowing China to ship packages virtually for free within the U.S. gives its e-commerce customers an unfair advantage that goes far beyond Radio Shack to America's entire online retail industry. Even Amazon, with its massive economies of scale, has raised its voice against this postal malpractice. Smaller businesses that make a living on eBay are even more vulnerable.Leveling the e-commerce playing field has to start with reform of the UPU's outdated rules and its skewed pricing system for international postal shipping. The UPU meets every four years to set prices -- the next meeting is in Istanbul in late September. Reform should start by moving China up out of Category 3 to Category 2 or even 1, where it really belongs.Then Congress needs to stop the USPS subsidizing Chinese e-commerce through misguided policies like ePacket, set up in 2010 to offer additional services to Chinese companies shipping small packages to the U.S. That's dealt a devastating blow to U.S. eBay vendors -- and since ePacket was extended in 2015 to Alibaba, the biggest of China's e-commerce predators, future victims won't just be eBay vendors. (The USPS, by the way, loses more than a dollar on every incoming ePacket shipment.)Who killed Radio Shack isn't a mystery at all. The real mystery is, when are the USPS, Congress and a new administration going to start pushing back on China's predatory e-commerce practices -- and the U.N. rules that support and subsidize it?

302,EBAY,"EBay (EBAY) stock hit a record high Thursday, and the e-commerce company's stock received multiple price-target hikes, following a quarterly earnings report that beat expectations.After the close Wednesday, eBay reported second-quarter earnings results that included a 6% year-over-year rise in revenue to $2.2 billion. It also issued full-year guidance above the Wall Street consensus estimates, though its Q3 guidance was light.EBay stock jumped 10.9% to close at 29.93 in the stock market today, surpassing its high last set in December and hitting a buy point.RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney raised his price target on eBay to 31 from 28, but he maintained a sector perform rating.""At the margin, we are more constructive,"" Mahaney wrote in a research note. ""But our investment opinion is unchanged. The key investor decision remains whether eBay is a Cash Cow, a Cash Cube (as in the melting kind), or potentially recovering Cash Cougar.""Jefferies analyst Brian Pitz maintained a hold rating but raised his price target to 32 from 27, calling it a solid quarter. ""Strategic initiatives such as structured data are on track, and early signs are encouraging, but work remains to transition more categories and improve the customer experience,"" he wrote in a research noteCowen analyst John Blackledge raised his price target to 30 from 24, with a market perform rating. Needham analyst Kerry Rice maintained a hold rating, but without a price target.IBD'S TAKE: EBay has seen a surge in its stock price since June 28, up more than 25% since then. But eBay has also been an underperformer overall, with an IBD Composite Rating of 65, meaning it has outperformed 65% of all stocks based on a variety of key metrics. It has a weak EPS Rating of 44, where 99 is highest.For the year, eBay expects revenue of $8.85 billion to $8.95 billion, above the consensus of $8.8 billion. It expects EPS of $1.85 to $1.90, with the midpoint above the consensus of $1.86.Almost exactly one year ago, eBay and its former payments unit PayPal (PYPL) split into two separate companies. PayPal met Q2 earnings views after the close Thursday and beat on revenue as it also agreed to a partnership with Visa (V).EBay also approved an additional $2.5 billion in stock repurchase authorization. In Q2, the company repurchased $500 million of its common stock, or 20.8 million shares. It ended the quarter with cash and equivalents of $10.4 billion.

303,EBAY,"The stock market was lower going into the noon hour Wednesday, focused on Apple's earnings, while oil prices staged a big downward reversal as U.S. inventories unexpectedly rose.The Nasdaq fell 0.8%, weighed down by Apple (AAPL); the S&P 500 fell 0.2%, and the Dow Jones industrial average dropped less than 0.1% in the stock market today. Volume was tracking higher across the board.The price of West Texas Intermediate futures for June delivery stood at $44.15 a barrel, up 11 cents or 0.2%. It traded as high as $45.18 -- the highest price since last November -- on the heels of a report Tuesday from the American Petroleum Institute suggesting inventories fell 1.1 million barrels in the week ended April 22. That report had boosted prices Wednesday morning.But then, the weekly report from the Energy Information Administration at 10:30 a.m. Eastern time said domestic crude inventories rose by 2 million barrels for the week, and that sent prices lower.The stock market has mostly risen along with a recovery in oil this year, but investors were more concerned about disappointing earnings reports from a key big-cap name.Apple gapped down and was trading nearly 7% lower after missing estimates Tuesday night. Numerous analysts chimed in Wednesday morning with lowered ratings and price targets.EBay (EBAY) rose 4% after beating estimates for profit and sales and issued guidance above Wall Street views. The stock has been underperforming the market.TransUnion (TRU) gapped out of a cup-with-handle base with a 28.21 buy point in heavy volume after reporting earnings of 32 cents a share, double that of a year earlier, and bested estimates of 26 cents. Revenue came in at $406 million, up 15% and ahead of estimates of $380 million.Ultimate Software (ULTI) is up 0.5% after the firm reported better-than-expected Q1 earnings and predicted Q2 sales would beat the Street. The stock jumped at the open, but it later gave back nearly all its gain. It also broke out of a cup-with-handle base with a 197.29 buy point, although the reversal is less-than-desirable action.

304,EBAY,"Going solo suits PayPal (PYPL). The payments giant Wednesday beat analyst Q1 revenue and earnings estimates, sending shares rising after hours, as Q2 sales guidance edged views and EPS guidance met expectations.Delivered after the market close, PayPal said it logged $2.54 billion in Q1 sales, up 19% from the year-earlier quarter, while earnings per share minus items rose 28% to 37 cents. It's the third straight quarter PayPal has beat earnings estimates. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected $2.5 billion and 35 cents.""Our first-quarter results continue to demonstrate the power of our global payments platform to attract and engage consumers, increasing our global scale and in turn attracting new merchants and partners to PayPal,"" CEO Dan Schulman said in the earnings release.For Q2, the payments company expects revenue to rise 16% to 18%, to $2.57 billion-$2.62 billion. The company estimates EPS ex items at 34 cents to 36 cents, up from 33 cents in Q2 2015. Wall Street had modeled $2.57 billion and 35 cents.The company reiterated its full-year guidance of sales growth of 16% to 19% and non-GAAP earnings of between $1.45 and $1.50. In 2015, sales rose 15% and EPS ex items came in at $1.30.PayPal said it increased its total active accounts 2% to 184 million from the 179 million it reported in its Q4 results. In Q4, the company added 6.6 million accounts, up 3% over Q3.PayPal says now has 14 million merchants using the platform, up from 13 million in Q4, with new merchants that include Panera Bread (PNRA) and Crate and Barrel.

There is no charge for users, but the company has started to make its ""pay with Venmo"" option available to select merchants, charging fees to merchants for those transactions. It plans to expand the service to more merchants but hasn't given a timeline.The San Jose, Calif.-based company, which last July spun off from former parent eBay (EBAY), saw its stock rise 2% in after-hours trading Wednesday, after the company released its earnings. PayPal stock rose a fraction in Wednesday's regular session, to 40.01. The stock is just below a 40.03 buy point, but in buy range from a lower 38.62 entry.PayPal is an IBD Leaderboard stock, with a strong Composite Rating of 92, where 99 is the highest. Yet, PayPal competes with a bevy of tech leaders that have been expanding into payments and digital wallets, including companies such as Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google and Apple (AAPL).Since its spinoff from eBay, PayPal stock has dipped as low as 30 in last August to 41.75 in March, its highest point since touched 42.55 in its July 20 debut on Nasdaq.With more freedom, PayPal has taken on such initiatives as running a multimillion-dollar commercial in this year's Super Bowl  telecast.

307,EBAY,"PayPal's (PYPL) revenue growth surpasses that of Visa (V) and MasterCard (MA), but it might not be as well positioned as the credit card networks, says Oppenheimer & Co., which initiated coverage on PayPal stock Friday with a buy rating.Oppenheimer analyst Glenn Greene set a price target of 43 on PayPal stock.""We believe PayPal's positioning within the payment processing ecosystem is less attractive than that of the card networks (MasterCard and Visa). However, PayPal's revenue growth of perhaps mid-teens over the next few years is more robust than either the networks or merchant acquirers,"" wrote Greene in his research report.Paypal stock ended unchanged in the stock market today. PayPal, which faces increasing competition from Apple (AAPL) Pay and other digital wallets, has an IBD Composite Rating of 73 out of a possible 99. It's been trading below the key 50-day moving average for the past month.PayPal recently launched its redesigned mobile app, which works on Apple iPhones and Android-based devices, in 145 countries. Prior to being spun off by eBay (EBAY) nearly a year ago, PayPal acquired Braintree, a mobile payment service, and Venmo, a hybrid peer-to-peer mobile payment app and social network targeted at millennials.PayPal's relationship with Visa remains a topic of interest, said Greene in his research report. He says that, based on comments by Visa executives, there could be closer ties or more direct competition coming.""To quote Visa CEO Charles Scharf on May 23, 'Anyone that's trying to take your customers and disintermediate you is not a friend. … We'd love to figure out a different model with them (PayPal) where it's consumer choice first where they're not disintermediating. … The other door is where we go full steam and compete with them in ways that people have never seen before.'  We suspect this rhetoric wasn't meant as loud as it sounded,"" Greene wrote.

308,EBAY,"Sometimes a stock will appear to be forming a cup base, but then the pattern will just fall apart. Before kicking the stock off your watch list, leave it in there a little longer. It may be forming a double-bottom base instead.Like the cup with handle (see the column published June 9), the double bottom is one of the more common winning patterns that investors are likely to find.See Full Series On Smart Chart ReadingThis is a roller-coaster pattern that can lead to big gains. Past market winners such as Cisco Systems (CSCO), eBay (EBAY) and data-storage king EMC (EMC) all cleared double-bottom bases at one time or another en route to huge gains.The double-bottom base needs at least seven weeks to form. Remember to generally start counting on the first down-week. Although rare, some double bottoms can be as long as a year.Typically, the correction in a double-bottom pattern should be no more than 35% in a market uptrend, like the cup with handle. But in bear markets, the correction in a double-bottom pattern can be as deep as 50%.Each price pattern in the CAN SLIM methodology has a certain look. For the double-bottom, it's defined by the W shape with two lows.The second low should undercut the first, creating a shakeout to scare off the weak holders.The middle peak of the double bottom should be lower than the left-side high. If the middle peak is higher, you don't have a double-bottom base.For the double bottom, you don't have to wait until the stock clears the left-side high to buy. The buy point is 10 cents above the middle peak. A double bottom will sometimes form a handle, giving a lower entry point.MDC Holdings (MDC) had a nice run from 2012 to the start of 2013 , as the housing market rebounded. The homebuilder was a turnaround; it lost money from 2007 to 2011, but was expected to turn a profit for 2012.The stock formed an eight-week double-bottom base with a 30.05 buy point in the first half of 2012. MDC's middle peak was below its left-side high (1) and the second low undercut the first (2), making it a proper pattern.MDC cleared the base in the week ended June 29 in heavier weekly trade. Volume was soft on its breakout day of June 26, but came in the next day. The stock jumped 40% by September before settling into a new pattern.(Editor's Note: This story originally published in the Jan. 16, 2013, edition of IBD.)

309,EBAY,"The No. 3 economy in Latin America is undergoing big changes, sparking a rally in Argentina's stock markets. The trend may push the only Argentina-focused ETF to snap out of a long slumber.The Merval stock index has jumped more than 30% this year.

The center-right politician has moved the country away from protectionism, settled debt defaults, lifted foreign-exchange controls and is revamping a discredited economics statistics agency.Global X MSCI Argentina ETF (ARGT), launched in March 2011, has mainly traveled sideways and is down 4% since its inception. But since touching a low in January, the fund has shot up nearly 24%.

The average market cap of the ETF is nearly $8 billion.Tenaris (TS), a manufacturer of steel pipes with operations in Argentina and many other countries, is forming a base after soaring as much as 60% from a January low. Like many commodity-based stocks, Tenaris' results slumped the past three years, including a loss in 2015. But analysts now forecast a profit of 23 cents a share for 2016, increasing 174% in 2017. The completion of a project in Argentina contributed to another decline in sales in the second quarter.MercadoLibre (MELI) has been a winner this year and shares responsibility for the success of Global X MSCI Argentina. MercadoLibre, a clone of eBay that operates in Latin America, surged 14% Aug. 5 when the company beat Q2 expectations.Not to overstate Argentina's role, MercadoLibre and Tenaris, the two largest pieces of the ETF, owe much of their performance to other markets in which they operate.Another big holding of Global X MSCI Argentina is YPF (YPF), one of the largest oil companies in Argentina. Shares have been consolidating since reaching an interim peak June 8. Globant (GLOB), with a presence in Argentina and other Latin American countries, has been a steady climber since it broke out in April past a 32.75 buy point.But major Argentine banks Banco Macro (BMA) and Grupo Financiero Galicia (GGAL), along with Telecom Argentina (TEO), are some major holdings that haven't contributed much to the ETF's performance.The ETF broke out of a base June 6 and is up about 9% from the 21.42 buy point. At the start of August, it pulled back to the 50-day moving average, where it found support and created a secondary buy area.

UnitedHealth (UNH), the largest managed care firm, topped EPS views and said 2017 profit will improve from exiting nearly all exchanges.United Airlines (UAL) beat Q2 estimates and cut full-year carrying capacity growth, as international uncertainties weighed. The carrier also said it would reduce winter flights to the U.K. Delta Air Lines (DAL) said in the prior week that it would do the same following the nation's Brexit vote. Southwest (LUV) forecast a Q3 unit revenue decline, which would be its first this year.

311,EBAY,"PayPal (PYPL) and Visa (V) late Thursday announced a wide-ranging partnership, easing tension between the online payment processor and credit card network.PayPal's online payment system will no longer steer customers away from Visa's credit card network. Visa cards will be a payment option for PayPal users. The companies said their pact would make transactions more efficient and secure. PayPal will gain access to Visa's ""tokenization services,"" starting in the U.S., for in-store PayPal transactions. These services boost security.""PayPal is walking away from steering their customers to ACH (automated clearing house) as the preferred payment type,"" Thad Peterson, an analyst at Aite Group, told IBD.

314,EBAY,"The contentious issue over whether the U.S. government should be able to force tech companies to weaken security on their smartphones and software apps so that law enforcement agencies can access private data isn’t likely to be resolved soon.But it could be.All it would take is for President Barack Obama to make a statement supporting strong encryption on tech devices and Internet services.Obama holds himself up as a tech-savvy president, but his lack of leadership on the encryption issue has prolonged the dispute between the federal government and tech firms, tech groups and privacy advocates say.“The White House should be leading on this issue,” said Cindy Cohn, executive director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF). “President Obama is trying to be the best tech president ever. He’s got really good technical consultants, and the idea that he wouldn’t listen to them is shocking.”The tech industry is united in its call to keep encryption strong, saying that weakening software security or creating back doors for authorities to bypass privacy protections opens the door for hackers and criminals.“The math doesn’t change,” Cohn said. “The math is the problem that the FBI has, which is: They cannot build a back door that only they can use. It doesn’t matter which technical expert you bring to bear on it. … This isn’t controversial in the tech community.”The FBI has sought court orders in two criminal cases to try to compel Apple (AAPL) to unlock password-protected iPhones. In both cases, the FBI ultimately backed down when it found other ways to access data on the devices. One involved paying a third party to hack the phone, and the other was resolved when the phone’s owner provided the password.Last September, EFF, Access Now, and a coalition of nonprofit and industry groups launched a public petition calling on President Obama to defend strong encryption and oppose back doors. They used the We The People API, Obama’s preferred petition tool, and quickly surpassed 100,000 signatures.Despite the White House’s pledge to respond to petitions with 100,000 signatures within 60 days, it has remained quiet and is now four months overdue in its response.But if Obama doesn’t support strong encryption for businesses and consumers, perhaps the next president will. On Wednesday, 13 U.S. tech industry groups representing companies such as Apple, Amazon.com (AMZN), Facebook (FB) and Uber Technologies urged the two presumptive major party presidential nominees to support strong commercial encryption.The encryption stance is among a list of tech industry requests made in an open letter to Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump.The trade groups asked the candidates to strengthen cybersecurity and encourage other governments to do the same. The letter urged the candidates to recognize the importance of encryption as a critical security tool and to advance policies that enhance data privacy.Groups signing the letter included the Consumer Technology Association, the Business Software Alliance, the Internet Association and the Semiconductor Industry Association.The encryption issue made headlines earlier this year when the FBI secured a federal court order to force Apple to unlock a smartphone belonging to deceased San Bernardino, Calif., shooter Syed Farook. Apple fought the order, saying it would set a dangerous precedent.To help educate the public, Apple CEO Tim Cook stepped up to become the face of consumer data security. He gave high-profile media interviews and made public statements about the importance of strong encryption.Apple’s fight to protect its encryption is about securing the data on all iPhones in use from bad guys, Cook said. That means securing customers’ data, including financial and health information, confidential business documents, private communications and photos.The FBI might have retreated in the cases of the San Bernardino terrorist and a Brooklyn drug dealer, but it is likely to pursue similar cases against tech companies in the future. Unless the White House tells it not to.Meanwhile, law enforcement supporters on Capitol Hill are crafting legislation that could force tech companies to comply with all law enforcement demands for customer data.Sens. Richard Burr, R-N.C., and Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., have proposed the “Compliance With Court Orders Act of 2016.” As drafted, the legislation would require any individual or company to comply with any U.S. court order and hand over data to authorities, including data that is encrypted. The bill has been roundly criticized by civil liberties and digital privacy groups.“I don’t think anything will happen in this session of Congress,” said Gary Shapiro, president of the the Consumer Technology Association. Political gridlock, especially during an election year, will ensure that no encryption bill is passed in Congress, he said.It is more likely that a court case will work its way up to the Supreme Court over the next couple of years, he said.Even if the FBI gets what it wants from the courts or Congress, the law would only be enforceable in the U.S. Foreign companies and their encrypted products would be unaffected, putting U.S. tech firms at a competitive disadvantage, Shapiro said.Public support for encryption is growing, especially in light of major data breaches at companies like Anthem (ANTM), eBay (EBAY), Home Depot (HD), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Target (TGT), as well as at government agencies, Cohn said.“We don’t live in a world where computer security is abstract and the damages and problems it causes for people are something that’s theoretical anymore,” Cohn said. “I think it strikes a lot of people as absurd that the government is engaging in trying to attack our security and undermine it and convince companies to give less of it when it should be their job to promote it.”Weakening security on mobile devices and software, says Shapiro, would destroy the confidence people have in businesses to keep their private data secure.

315,EBAY,"Delays and staff cuts at Merchant Customer Exchange (MCX), a mobile payments consortium, will likely boost Apple Pay, while PayPal (PYPL) management’s view on MCX’s woes should be a hot topic at PayPal's analyst day on Wednesday.MCX said Tuesday it will cut 30 jobs and again delay the launch of its mobile app, a potential rival of Apple (AAPL) Pay and others. MCX has been courting retailers, Apple, Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Google, PayPal, Samsung, Visa (V) and others in the mobile payments space. Wal-Mart (WMT) has been MCX's main backer.PayPal will be hosting its first analyst day following its 2015 spinoff from eBay (EBAY) last year. The event will be held in San Jose, Calif. PayPal recently launched its redesigned mobile app, which works on Apple iPhones and Android-based devices, in 145 countries.While Apple and MCX were rivals, PayPal has aimed to partner with different players in mobile payments. PayPal in March 2015 acquired Paydiant, which had close ties to MCX and retailers.MCX had aimed to reduce the clout of credit card firms in the nascent mobile payments business, analysts say. Prior to the latest MCX announcement, Citigroup analyst Ashwin Shirvaikar said in a research report that PayPal’s relationship with Visa and MasterCard (MA) was one area of interest heading into its analyst day.At Jefferies, analyst Jason Kupferberg was also hoping for an update on Visa.“PayPal’s relationship with Visa remains a topic of interest for the Street, but we wouldn't be surprised if there is limited commentary at the analyst day on this topic, given ongoing negotiations,” Kupferberg wrote in a report.Prior to the eBay spinoff, PayPal acquired Braintree, a mobile payment service, and Venmo, a hybrid mobile payment app and social network for millennials.Daniel Perlin, an analyst at RBC Capital, expects mobile to be a big theme at PayPal’s analyst day. “We believe management will outline its plans to shift from its legacy e-commerce platform into a leading mobile-first platform for payments, with its Braintree asset being front and center.”

316,EBAY,"Amazon (AMZN) reported its highest sales growth in nearly four years Thursday, while continued robust gains at its cloud-computing unit and merchandise operations also point to a strong current quarter.The e-commerce powerhouse swung to a first-quarter profit of $1.07 a share, which crushed the consensus earnings estimate of 58 cents, and swinging from a loss of 12 cents a share a year earlier. Revenue jumped 28% to $29.1 billion, ahead of the $28 billion view.Amazon sees total Q2 revenue of between $28 billion and $30.5 billion, largely above Wall Street forecasts of $28.3 billion. That would be a 26% gain at the midpoint.Shares jumped more than 12% in late trading, positioning the stock to blast back through its buy point of 603.34 when trading begins Friday. Amazon closed down 0.75% to 602 on Thursday.Is Amazon's stock a buy, hold or sell right now? Take a free trial of IBD LeaderboardThe earnings beat is likely due to businesses buried within Amazon, such as its cloud computing division, ChannelAdvisor Executive Chairman Scot Wingo told IBD, adding that its third-party marketplace had a significant effect on Q1 profits too.Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company's cloud-computing division, saw revenue soar 64% to $2.57 billion. AWS was expected to post $2.54 billion in sales, according to FactSet. AWS has been closely watched by investors since the company began reporting its sales separately.""Once again, Amazon Web Services exhibited significant growth, with revenues up $1 billion. However, the more impressive metric is margin, which roughly doubled to 23.5%, generating over $600 million, or roughly 60%, of Amazon’s total operating income,"" Moody's analyst Charlie O'Shea said in an email.Though AWS is a runaway leader in cloud computing, Alphabet (GOOGL), through its Google division, and Microsoft (MSFT) are mounting fierce competition. In its earnings release last week, Microsoft said its annualized run-rate for the cloud is over $10 billion.Meanwhile, Amazon's electronics and general merchandise category was also strong, Wingo said. ""In North America it grew 32%, and 33% internationally -- it's an acceleration over the holiday period, which is amazing.""Amazon's Prime Now one-hour delivery service may have accounted for the acceleration, or at least part of it, Wingo said. With its latest expansion into Tampa, Fla., Prime Now covers 42% of the U.S.Amazon has called its expedited shipping options ""difficult and expensive"" but has said shoppers love them. In previous quarters, shipping costs have weighed on earnings, but Q1 growth in total expenses lagged topline gains: 25% vs. 28%.Free cash flow minus principal repayments increased to $3.5 billion from $1.5 billion in the year-earlier quarter. Free cash flow can be useful to determine whether Amazon sales are growing fast enough to cover the big bets CEO Jeff Bezos makes on things such as data centers, fulfillment centers and new product lines.Working together, the Prime loyalty program, third-party market and Fulfillment By Amazon have created flywheels that further drive profits.""Amazon is taking share from everybody at this point,"" Wingo said.E-commerce as a sector is growing at about 15%, while brick-and-mortar retail grow by between 2% and 3%, he estimated. Amazon rival eBay (EBAY) posted 5% growth, but only 3% came from the marketplace.Bezos also touted the company's hardware offerings, such as the Fire TV Stick, Fire Tablets and Echo, but Wingo said that at this point, the sales for the family of Echo products are not significantly boosting electronics and general merchandise sales.""We’re building premium products at non-premium prices, and we’re thrilled so many customers are responding to our approach,"" Bezos said in a press release.OK

317,EBAY,"Alibaba (BABA) says it's on a path to realizing its vision of achieving $1 trillion in gross merchandise volume in about four years, as it also pursues a goal of reaching 2 billion consumers on its e-commerce platforms.During the company’s conference call after posting its fiscal-fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday, company CEO Daniel Zhang cited reasons he's optimistic of hitting the $1 trillion GMV goal. One big reason, he noted, is Alibaba’s successful transition from PCs to mobile devices.By comparison, e-commerce software firm ChannelAdvisor (ECOM) estimates Amazon.com's (AMZN) GMV in 2015 at $225.6 billion, with 310 million users.At the time of Alibaba's initial public offering in September 2014, mobile contributed less than 40% of GMV. Today, it’s 73%.Success also depends on international expansion and in continuing to transform its e-commerce business, along with continued investments and growth in its media and digital entertainment platforms, as well as its cloud computing business.Alibaba is one of the four largest Internet companies in China. The others are JD.com (JD), which runs a direct-to-consumer e-commerce site similar to Amazon (AMZN); China search-engine leader Baidu (BIDU); and Tencent Holdings (TCEHY), which dominates in gaming and mobile messaging.For all Zhang's bravado, Alibaba is less than halfway toward its goal: For its fiscal year ended March 31, Alibaba had GMV of $485 billion, up 27%. And it said it had 423 million active buyers, up 21%.GMV is the total value of goods sold across Alibaba’s e-commerce platforms. Alibaba does not take part in direct sales, hold inventory or compete directly with its merchant base. Businesses and consumers use Alibaba's e-commerce platform, and Alibaba takes about a 2.5% cut of GMV sales. It also makes money from advertising.Alibaba's core e-commerce retail platforms are Taobao, Tmall and Juhuasuan. Together, they have 367 million active buyers, with about 90% of Alibaba’s revenue generated in China.Getting to $1 trillion will depend on the growth and expansion mainly of Tmall and Taobao. Tmall is China’s largest business-to-consumer website. Taobao is a consumer-to-consumer e-commerce website similar to eBay (EBAY). Taobao is the larger of the two. In fiscal 2016, it hit GMV of $295 billion, up 18%. Tmall reached $190 billion, up 43%.Part of Alibaba’s GMV growth is pegged to global expansion. Alibaba last month announced it acquired a controlling stake in Singapore-based Lazada, a leading e-commerce platform in Southeast Asia, for $1 billion. Lazada operates online retail platforms across Indonesia, Thailand, Philippines, Malaysia, Vietnam and Singapore, with GMV of $1 billion in 2015.“Our acquisition of a controlling stake in Lazada will allow access to 560 million consumers in one of the most promising markets for e-commerce,” said Chung Tsai, Alibaba executive vice chairman, in the earnings conference call.Alibaba in the March quarter showed its highest growth rate in a year, despite an economic slowdown in China.“In these challenging times for the global economy, Alibaba is bucking the trend,” said Tsai. He said Chinese households today have aggregate net cash reserves of more than $4.6 trillion.“This accumulated wealth and liquidity is the result of real double-digit wage growth over the past decade,” he said.Kerry Rice, an analyst at Needham, says Alibaba has a lot of room for growth ahead.“We expect the company's core business to continue to be the engine of growth, and despite its scale and dominant market share, we believe it still has significant room for growth,” Rice wrote in a research report.Rice rates Alibaba stock a buy, with a price target of 95. Alibaba stock rose a fraction in the stock market today, to 79.20. Alibaba stock is up nearly 30% since touching a seven-month low in early February. Alibaba's stock has had a rocky trip since its blockbuster IPO raised $24 billion, the most ever. Shares priced at 68 and hit a peak of 120 in November 2014.RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney has an outperform rating and price target of 105 on Alibaba stock, up from a previous target of 89.Based on its strength in mobile, “we believe this means Alibaba can sustain premium growth rates in its key retail segment for the foreseeable future,” Mahaney wrote in a research note.

318,EBAY,"After leaked images and details of the new Amazon.com (AMZN) e-reader -- which largely proved true -- the company announced the official details Wednesday.The new Kindle, called Oasis, is the most expensive, smallest and lightest offering to date. Available for preorder Wednesday at $289.99, the Oasis is 30% thinner and more than 20% lighter than the other Kindles, according to Amazon's press release.Oasis weighs just 4.6 ounces, and it measures 3.4 millimeters -- just more than a 10th of an inch -- at its thinnest point.Amazon stock was up 1.5%, near 613, in midday trading on the stock market today. Amazon has an IBD Composite Rating of 78, where 99 is the highest. Shares broke out of a cup-with-handle base with a 603.34 buy point, in high volume.In its release, Amazon touted the two-battery design that the company claims will extend the battery life for ""months.""The cheapest Kindle starts at $79.99 but lacks the high-resolution display and other features of the more expensive models, such as the Paperwhite -- $119.99 -- or the Voyage, which costs $199.99.Amazon does not break out Kindle sales. The Associated Press, citing the Association of American Publishers, reported that overall e-reader sales rose 3.8% in 2014 to $3.37 billion.Seattle-based Amazon's content distribution -- it also live streams video like Netflix (NFLX) does, for example -- sets it apart from e-commerce players such as eBay (EBAY) and Wal-Mart (WMT).

319,EBAY,"With a potential $1 billion in 2016 revenue and $803 million in funding, e-tail startup Jet.com has some heft, but it's still a lightweight compared with e-tail king Amazon.com (AMZN).But that doesn't faze Jet CEO Marc Lore, who has a strategy, which he laid out for IBD in a phone interview from the company's Hoboken, N.J., headquarters. It boils down to two big ideas: that e-commerce overall will soar from a $300 billion market to $1 trillion in the next 10 years; and that Amazon can't possibly take the whole thing.His third point underlying both big ideas is that Jet is targeting shoppers that Amazon is not -- those obsessive about saving money.""We're going after a different type of customer with a different need,"" Lore said. ""We are about saving people money and empowering them to shop in a smarter way. And our technology is built to help consumers and retailers pull costs out of the overall ecosystem. So it is a more efficient way to buy product.""Jet aims to present shoppers with an experience that more closely matches what they'd find in a store. Every product, for example, has a single view. That's unlike e-tail giants like Amazon or eBay (EBAY), where shoppers are confronted with multiple, competing listings from a number of sellers. Instead Jet.com finds the best price for a given product after searching multiple sellers and displays.So, for example, in a search for Levi's jeans, a shopper would see a single listing for each style of jeans. The single product view may also help Jet.com avoid the SEO challenges that have plagued eBay, which has a longtime beef with search leader Google.But the real secret sauce for shoppers is the company's dynamic pricing. Essentially, customers are rewarded for buying multiple items, which decreases shipping costs and thus decreases customers' costs. Then, when the customer goes to check out, Jet's algorithm behind the scenes figures out which sellers are the most efficient in terms of shipping and price, so if one seller is closer but charges more for shipping, you'll buy from a more distant seller that charges less for shipping and thus results in a lower overall cost for the customer.""Our technology is built more like a real-time trading system than it is an e-commerce site,"" Lore said. ""As people shop, we're repricing products to reflect the true underlying economics of getting those products to the customer, based on what products are already in the (checkout) basket and based on how far away those products are from where the customer lives.""Jet continues to tweak its website. When Lore launched the venture in July 2015, the company used a membership program similar to Costco's (COST) to generate profit. That didn't last long, and the company changed its business model in October, hiking prices. Though there were reports the change signaled trouble, several analysts interviewed for this report said startups often make strategic changes early on.As shown by its fundraising and number of investors, Jet.com has its believers. Its venture money comes from China e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA), prominent Silicon Valley venture capital firms such as General Catalyst Partners, and the venture units of financial powerhouses Goldman Sachs (GS) and Fidelity National Financial (FNF), among others. The company is valued at $1 billion, huge for any startup but a blip compared with Amazon's $286 billion market cap.Amazon has annual revenue topping $100 billion -- not including the more than $131 billion in third-party sales -- and is catching up to longtime No. 1 retailer Wal-Mart (WMT). Amazon also has a nascent payments business that competes with PayPal (PYPL). To facilitate its e-commerce sales, the company has elected to get into the ocean shipping business, which has the potential to generate hundreds of millions in free cash flow. And that's just the e-tail business.Conventional wisdom holds that one strategy to beat Amazon is to pick and choose categories of goods that Amazon is not strong in. One, for example, is fashion -- though Amazon recently launched its own line of apparel and a live-streaming TV show. Alibaba-funded e-tail startup ShopRunner is taking aim at Amazon that way.Lore chose another route.In Lore's view of the e-commerce universe, mass market firms -- those competing across a range of product categories -- are the only viable firms. That's because, Lore says, whether a website is selling one category of products or 10, you need to push them ""through the same set of pipes."" And thus, he says, it makes more sense to leverage the same set of fixed costs to increase sales.""If you have 10 times as many categories and 10 times the gross marketplace value going through the same set of pipes, you're going to get a lot more leverage in your fixed expenses, and your expenses as a percentage of revenue is going to be a lot lower,"" Lore said. ""It makes it really difficult for the specialty guys to compete on price with mass merchants for that reason.""Lore himself has a fair bit of experience with Amazon and its CEO, Jeff Bezos. As founder and former CEO of Quidsi, known for its Diapers.com, Lore spent years facing off against Amazon. Ultimately, Bezos killed Diapers.com with a price war -- the e-tail giant can afford to lose money for longer than its often smaller competitors -- and bought the company from Lore. The CEO stuck around for about three years but ultimately left in 2013.A little more than a year in, Jet.com remains one of the few e-tail companies in the U.S. that's openly challenging Amazon's dominance. With a run rate of $1 billion in gross merchandise value expected to be reached by the end of June -- a figure often very close to revenue for e-tail firms -- and 3.5 million registered shoppers, Lore already has taken Jet on a long flight, with a long runway ahead.

323,EBAY,"PayPal Holdings' (PYPL) is expected to report Thursday that its second-quarter profit rose 9%, amid speculation the online payments processor could announce a deal of some sort with Visa (V), which also reports its own fiscal-third-quarter results on Thursday.PayPal's relationship with Visa has been a source of speculation. PayPal, spun off from eBay last year, and the credit card networks are both eyeing mobile payments, where Apple Pay, the mobile wallet of Apple (AAPL), is a rival.PayPal's quarterly profit is expected to grow 9% to 36 cents per share with revenue rising 13% to nearly $2.6 billion, according to analysts polled by Thomson Reuters.""Expectations are low ahead of the Q2 print,"" said Jason Kupferberg, an analyst at Jefferies, in a report. ""We believe the core business continues to perform well and maintain our view that competitive concerns (regarding Apple Pay) are overdone.""IBD'S TAKE: PayPal stock is up about 12% so far in 2016. Learn more at IBD Stock Checkup. PayPal could be acquired, some analysts have speculated, though the company has said it's not up for sale.PayPal moved up its earnings call to be the same day as Visa's, due right after Visa's call, RBC Capital analyst Daniel Perlin noted in a report.PayPal's online checkout service has used an automated clearinghouse (ACH) system set up by bank partners. That poses issues for Visa, and PayPal may cooperate more with credit-card companies, says Perlin.He says it's also possible that Visa ""plays hardball"" and imposes new digital wallet fees. PayPal may need to explain the economic impact of whatever happens with Visa, Perlin speculated in the report.PayPal shares rose 1.7% to 40.05 on the stock market today. Visa climbed 0.8%.

326,EBAY,"In a bid to capture even more of the world's digital wallet, the company has announced the first overseas expansion of its PayPal (PYPL) Credit business -- essentially lending money to consumers at checkout.The move, announced Wednesday, will add pressure in the United Kingdom (where the feature was rolled out) to other payments options -- such as Amazon.com (AMZN) and its offering. PayPal Credit will offer 0% interest during the first four months for purchase amounts of 150 British pounds and higher, afterward subject to the standard variable interest rate, which is 17.9% at publication time.Limits will depend on each person's credit, which will take about 10 minutes.PayPal also faces competitive pressures from relatively new entrants into the digital wallet sector, Google with its Android Pay, and Apple (AAPL) Pay.Google is a unit of Alphabet (GOOGL).PayPal stock fell a fraction to 38.64 on the stock market today. The stock is finding support at its 50-day moving average, a positive move just when the stock needed one. Volume, though, has been lackluster as shares bounce back. The stock is still below a potential buy point. The company has an IBD Composite Rating of 93, where 99 is the highest.The U.K. is PayPal's second largest market outside of the U.S., according to Mashable, which notes that of nearly 180 million active customer accounts, 22 million are located in the United Kingdom.The program began in 2014 as a pilot with limited availability.The marketing messaging the company is using -- ""the future of money"" -- is consistent with its global advertising push after its spinoff from eBay (EBAY) in 2015. Thus far the campaign has included the firm's first-ever Super Bowl ad.

"
329,EBAY,"In recent years, no industry has provided shareholder activists with as many opportunities to force changes -- or generate financial gains -- as technology.In its Shareholder Activism 2015 report issued last November, Moody's found that 33% of the 178 shareholder activism cases it had tracked through Oct. 15 of last year focused on tech firms, far more than any other industry.Tech firms, ironically, can blame their successes as well as their failures for their preferred status among shareholder activists. The sector's growth potential attracts the hedge funds and equity investors that are less inclined to sit docilely on the sidelines.""You really have to have a stomach for it,"" said Gerry Granovsky, an analyst at bond rating firm Moody's Investor Service. ""A lot of it is confrontational. You have to not be afraid to ruffle feathers.""Where many of the most famous shareholder activism cases have focused on poorly managed companies that represented turnaround opportunities -- which does include a fair number of tech companies, to be sure -- many tech firms instead have been targeted for not sharing their riches enough.Granovsky points out that as the tech sector has demonstrated historic stability over the past 10 years, it has enjoyed growing access to debt. Meanwhile, as scores of tech firms have grown into thriving global businesses, many have amassed massive amounts of cash overseas and have chosen to keep it there rather than pay U.S. tax rates.It's that cash, and companies' explanations for hording it, that often attracts the attention of shareholder activists more than anything.""Activists don't care about policies. They see Apple having $216 billion in cash,"" Granovsky said. ""To some extent they have a point.""The activities of shareholder activists do at least potentially benefit a larger group of stakeholders, and shareholder activists do function as a sort of corporate watchdog, so they have to be willing to get dirty for the cause.After finding itself on the receiving end of pressure from big-name shareholder activists Carl Icahn and David Einhorn, Apple (AAPL) has in the past couple of years been returning cash to shareholders in programmatic fashion.Similarly, persistent pressure from activists helped spur ATM maker NCR (NCR) to embark on an effort to buy back $1 billion worth of stock, funded by a deal with Blackstone that gives the financial advisory firm three seats on NCR's board -- a deal activist investor and NCR shareholder P. Schoenfeld Asset Management has questioned.Targeting excess cash is not a new shareholder activism strategy. In fact, it appears to have been one of the original strategies.In his just released book, ""Dear Chairman: Boardroom Battles and the Rise of Shareholder Activism,"" Jeff Gramm, a portfolio manager and adjunct professor at Columbia Business School, traces shareholder activism back to the 1920s. Gramm explores a 1927 case in which economist and investor Benjamin Graham, considered the father of value investing, led an effort to get Northern Pipeline to release some of its stockpile of unused cash back to its shareholders.That strategy has been used against tech firms to great effect in recent years, with a number of companies succumbing to similar pressures. And Granovsky says that trend might not peak until interest rates rise, causing tech firms to slow their borrowing and instead start tapping those overseas cash reserves.No worries. Even if all the cash-rich tech companies start giving back to shareholders, there are always underperformers to turn around.Despite the stability in the tech market Granovsky points to, there are plenty of tech companies that have found themselves in activists' cross-hairs for other reasons. In 2013, Microsoft (MSFT) granted its first board seat to an activist -- ValueAct Capital -- after facing widespread criticism for being a step behind a series of emerging tech trends such as cloud computing and mobility.Last year, Qualcomm (QCOM) launched a ""strategic realignment plan"" after activist hedge fund Jana Partners began pressuring the company to spin off its struggling chip business from its profitable licensing business. Also last year, eBay (EBAY) spun off PayPal (PYPL) after pressure to do so from several activists, led by Icahn, who argued that both companies would perform better if separated.More recently, Yahoo (YHOO) has been girding itself for a battle with one of its biggest shareholders, activist Starboard Value, as the Internet giant has been unable to forge much revenue growth in the past decade.Consider the case of Motorola Solutions (MSI). Shareholder activists have besieged the company since 2007, when its former entity, Motorola, was embroiled in a series of legal skirmishes over allegations the company had made misleading financial statements. (It eventually split into two companies in 2011, establishing Motorola Solutions as a communications provider, while it spun off the cellphone business into a separate company, Motorola Mobility, acquired by Google in 2011 and then sold to China's Lenovo in 2014.)Between 2007 and 2015, Motorola granted board seats to shareholder activists Icahn and ValueAct, and also to private-equity firm Silver Lake Partners.Shep Dunlap, an investor relations spokesman at Motorola Solutions, spoke with IBD about the company's experience with ValueAct, describing the relationship as ""generally collaborative"" and nothing like the contentious battles for which other shareholder activists, such as Icahn, have become known.""Their approach has been much more constructive with management rather than using the press and media as a mouthpiece,"" says Dunlap said.He says ValueAct's objectives have been aligned with Motorola's leadership from the get-go, and that ValueAct's guidance has helped streamline the company. In particular, he cites more than $550 million in costs removed since 2012, and $12 billion returned to shareholders, mostly through stock buybacks.""There's been a lot of progress in terms of optimizing our cost structure,"" Dunlap said. ""We're really a pure-play mission-critical communications company at this point.""Naturally, ValueAct has profited from the relationship, and today still owns 4.7% of the company's stock, a stake worth about $619 million based on the current valuation of $13.2 billion.Dunlap points to the fact that ValueAct has been a Motorola shareholder since 2011, longer than most activists stick around, as evidence of its commitment to the company's long-term health. He said not every activist is out to create a firestorm, cash out, and move on.""You have to keep an open mind when you're learning about an investor, whether it's an activist or not,"" he said. ""I think every company should use the feedback that's available to them from the investor community.""Its unlikely that the relationship has been as Pollyannaish as Dunlap paints it. Granovsky stopped short of describing shareholder activism as bullying, but was comfortable calling it intimidation.""Companies don’t want to deal with activists,"" he said.That said, there are times when they're a necessary evil if a company is to thrive, and Motorola may be an example of this.One thing is certain: Shareholder activists aren't going anywhere, and tech companies, and their piles of cash and occasional missteps, are clearly in their sights.

We have completed our first 100 days in office and already we have made America Great Again. Amazing! The best!I know everybody took a Big Gulp when I changed 9/11 to 7-Eleven last year. They thought I was a stupid person. A loser! Erin Gloria Ryan of Vocativ said I would start talking about the Japanese bombing of Pearl Jam and the Native Americans' Trail of Sears. Other terrible people -- the worst! -- thought I would refer to the eBay of Pigs, the Normandy landing on DQ Day, the Dodge Challenger disaster, Black & Decker Tuesday of 1929, the 1906 San FranCisco Systems Fire and the 1814 burning of the White Castle by the British.Wrong! Turning 9/11 into 7-Eleven was the beginning of something huge. Phenomenal! The people at 7-Eleven -- great retailer, decent coffee, convenient! -- loved it. Loved it! They said to me: Mr. Trump, if you could mention us and other corporations more often at unexpected moments, we think it would really help to Make America Great Again. And I said: We will do even better. We will Make America Great Again by selling some of our greatest assets to you and to America's other great corporations.We are meeting here in the MapQuest Room of the Trump National White House because our new Crate & Barrel Cabinet Room is being refurnished. Next we'll have a drink in the Johnnie Walker Blue Room, and we'll eat in the Allstate Dining Room. Look out the window there and you'll see amazing billboards going up on the Washington Mutual Monument, across the reflecting pool from the Lincoln Financial Group Memorial. In the distance you'll see the white dome of Capital One, the Tide Basin and Boeing National Airport. Huge!Jeff Sessions, our phenomenal secretary of Homeland Depot Security -- great guy! -- tells me Mexico has already paid for the wall. It's now the Aeromexico Wall -- ""because the only way around it is over it!"" Great slogan! We are making only the best deals, throughout the Federal Express government and across the entire United States of American Eagle Outfitters.They said I couldn't unify the Republican Party. But then I renamed the Navy the Ted Cruz Line. They said I couldn't hold on to the evangelical Christians. But then I renamed the Liberty University Bell and Niagara Falwells.Most of all, they said I couldn't get rid of the entire federal debt -- $19 trillion! -- in one year. They said I was stupid -- a loser! But I traveled this land, from the Redwood Inn forest to the Gulfstream G650, and knew that everybody wanted to buy American! So I sold the Treasury Department to Citigroup, the Pentagon to Lockheed Martin, the Food and Drug Administration to Pfizer, HHS to CVS, the EPA to Waste Management, the FBI to Apple, the NSA to Google and the Grand Canyon to GMC. Great deals! China gave up all $1.3 trillion of our debt -- and all I had to give them was the Walt Disney Company. Phenomenal deal!Now we are placing corporations' names in amazing places -- the greatest -- and we are winning, winning, winning, and we are making a lot of money. A lot. We are bringing out the best in America, the fast and convenient spirit of 7-Eleven, and I say: Oh, thank heaven. We are Making America Great Again.(APPLAUSE)

332,EBAY,"As Silicon Valley remains firmly rooted as the global center of technology and innovation, rarely mentioned is one huge fact that could blunt a ton of good vibes: The area is due for a  major earthquake.“There are going to be infrastructure problems,” David Walters, Cisco Systems (CSCO) director of global safety and security told IBD. “If it’s 6.5 or greater, the bottom line is that a lot of people are going to be walking.”The U.S. Geological Survey says there’s a 72% chance of a magnitude 6.7 or greater earthquake on one of the region’s many faults in the next 30 years. The percentage shoots up to 89% for a magnitude 6 or greater quake, USGS scientist Morgan Page told IBD. Either could be catastrophic.""The Bay Area has the highest density of active faults per square mile of any urban center in the country, and on a long-term basis it has the highest amount of earthquake energy released per square mile of any urban center in the country,"" David Schwartz, a geologist with the U.S. Geological Survey, told the East Bay Express in 2005. ""So we're really kind of living at ground zero.""A magnitude 7 or greater quake would ""likely"" spur damage to buildings and infrastructure in the range of $95 billion to $190 billion, says Renee Lee, an analyst with Risk Management Solutions, a firm that models risk for insurance companies. “Despite the area being really well educated about earthquakes, and the substantial investments in infrastructure, we will expect to see some pretty significant damage if there’s a quake along the Hayward fault.”Scientists have long considered the Hayward fault one of the most likely candidates for a major quake within a few decades. The fault runs through Oakland and other heavily populated East Bay cities.What’s all but certain is that Silicon Valley will experience widespread utilities losses -- water, power -- as well as damage to buildings and infrastructure such as roads and bridges.A phenomenon called liquefaction -- in which normally solid soil acts like a liquid -- could wreak havoc on any firms with offices near the San Francisco Bay’s shore. Oracle’s main campus, for example, sits atop what’s called bay fill, a material that is highly susceptible to liquefaction. (Oracle (ORCL) spokeswoman Jessica Moore refused to comment on the company's business-continuity plans in the event of an earthquake, or any other natural disaster.)Facebook (FB) and Alphabet (GOOGL) also have large campuses located on land susceptible to liquefaction -- though less so than Oracle's (neither of these companies responded to requests for comment). The liquefaction risk to Apple's (APPL) office in Cupertino is low.The good news is that the Internet will almost certainly continue to function, for the most part. Service disruptions are likely, but the core backbones that tie the Bay Area to the Internet will remain intact. That might not have been the case 15 years ago, though ""even then there were major fiber cuts that the Internet weathered fine,” Mike Leber, CEO of Hurricane Electric, an Internet backbone provider, told IBD via email.And many Silicon Valley companies have been sure to locate data centers in other parts of the country, so service disruptions are less likely.""Our data centers are located at sites which have limited potential for severe weather and seismic events,"" Yahoo spokeswoman Carolyn Clark told IBD in an emailed statement.Yet, though the experts can make educated guesses, no one knows how a big one might affect Silicon Valley, or any area, says Anne Wein, a USGS operations research analyst.""The hard work is going to be to get a description about what will happen,"" she told IBD. ""We're just not there yet.""The USGS is studying the issue, what it calls ""Project Haywired,"" and is aiming to complete its research in the fall, according to spokesman Justin Pressfield.In the meantime, uncertainty will persist. ""We haven't had a major earthquake in the U.S. since we have become so connected with wired and wireless technology,"" Wein said. ""Do we have new vulnerabilities? How much redundancy is there? How will this new technology help us recover?""Of 15 large Silicon Valley tech companies -- and several startups valued by investors at more than $1 billion -- that IBD contacted for this report, Adobe Systems (ADBE), eBay (EBAY), Oracle and PayPal (PYPL) declined to comment and nine did not return the request. Cisco provided access to executives for a wide-ranging interview, and Yahoo issued a brief statement.When asked why tech firms are reluctant to discuss business-continuity plans, Sam Singer, a public relations executive who specializes in crisis situations,  said tech companies are “better at talking about services and products. They’re not prepared to talk about public policy issues, safety issues, even though they ought to be.”He says that there’s no reason why companies shouldn’t be able to describe how they would deal with a natural disaster in the Bay Area without giving away proprietary information.“It’s important that companies discuss earthquakes,"" Singer said. ""They need to be leaders, and offer reminders to their employees, the public and the news media that we live in earthquake country.”Dick Evans, president of the Business Recovery Managers Association, a networking and information group for disaster recovery planners, told IBD that his group used to have more membership among major Silicon Valley firms. At the moment, he said, ""we don't have as many as we would like.""Cisco has been active in preparing for quakes. It might take the issue more seriously than others, in part, because it's among the tech giants that were around during the Loma Prieta earthquake of 1989, Walters says. That quake, centered near San Jose and San Francisco, killed 63 people, displaced 12,000, destroyed an estimated $6 billion worth of property and caused an unknown amount of productivity losses.At Cisco's main offices in San Jose, Walters says the company maintains what it calls ""Arks,"" which store water, food, tents and emergency supplies for all employees on site -- enough supplies to last up to three days.And executives all carry three-day survival backpacks in their vehicles, he says.The company also has a mobile operations center that can staff 13 -- and can turn it into a kind of mobile office for execs. The company has five command-and-control centers around the world -- with satellite communications abilities and backup generators for incident response vehicles. And the company conducts earthquake drills at its main offices.""We have the right processes, right supplies,"" Walters said. ""We know as much as we can about the fault lines and we want to be as knowledgeable as possible."" He adds that USGS scientists come in from time to time to talk about the fault lines with Cisco's safety and security team.The company also monitors incidents around the globe, and has a Tactical Operations team that it deploys on humanitarian missions to restore communications connectivity.Yahoo was willing to share a few details of its plans, though declined to provide access to business continuity executives.Spokeswoman Clark, in a statement, said ""Yahoo has prepared our technology, as well as our physical spaces, to allow us to continue to run and operate our business either in California or other parts of the world in the event of catastrophe. We have invested at our mission-critical facilities to provide for alternative power supplies that will allow those facilities to run in the event of a loss of power or other utilities.""

In his book “The Industries of the Future,” Alec Ross explains why trends in robots, advanced life sciences, digital money, cybersecurity, artificial intelligence and Big Data should be on everyone’s radar.“They are linked,” said Ross. “And they will all feed off of each other.”Information riches. “Big Data as a term is going to fade from use in two to three years,” said Ross, distinguished visiting fellow at Johns Hopkins University and former senior advisor for innovation to Hillary Clinton when she was secretary of state.Big Data will become simply ""data.""“Whereas land was the raw material of the agricultural age, and iron was the raw material of the industrial age, data is the raw material of the information age,” he told IBD.Metallic hands.

Their funding in robotics leapt from $160 million in 2011 to $341 million in 2014.Paper exodus. “A cryptocurrency will emerge within the next five years,” Ross said. “This is macro-economically significant.”Cryptocurrency encompasses digital money and virtual dough, such as bitcoins.Some parts of the world already use digital currency out of necessity.

334,EBAY,"Push a button, get some toilet paper. That's the idea behind Amazon.com (AMZN) Dash buttons, which for Amazon Prime members will ship a range of products to the doorstep of American households with the push of a button -- free two-day shipping and all.Thursday, Amazon announced that it's adding a bevy of new products to its line of Dash buttons, bringing the total to ""more than 100,"" according to a press release. The new merchandise includes things like coffee, beauty products, and yes, condoms.""The consumer packaged-goods companies are interested in anything that they can do to grow,"" Scot Wingo, executive chairman of ChannelAdvisor, told IBD in a telephone interview Thursday morning. ChannelAdvisor works with third-party sellers on a range of e-commerce websites such as Amazon.com and eBay (EBAY).Wingo says the consumer packaged-goods firms aren't getting more sales in brick-and-mortar stores and have looked to e-commerce to boost stagnant revenue. And Amazon -- the ever-innovating Seattle-based firm -- is trying to capture more dollars that households spend.Though Amazon did not disclose the exact number of Dash buttons sold, or the revenue said buttons generated (which is typical of the tight-lipped company), it did say that Dash orders have grown by more than 75% in the last three months and now take place about once every minute.Wingo called those numbers ""interesting.""""Peak Dash button will be in the mid-hundreds -- the 200 to 300 range. From there, we're likely to see Dash functionality integrated into more and more products, like the Brita filter Amazon has already announced.""Amazon's new additions to the Dash line include Energizer, Arm & Hammer cat litter and Peet's Coffee, among others.When asked about rivals such as eBay and Wal-Mart (WMT) tackling a similar program, Wingo said that it wasn't likely anytime soon.""Amazon is on version-nine-thinking, and the other guys are on version two,"" he said.There are already rumors swirling about the second generation of Dash buttons following Dave Zatz's discovery, through regulatory filings, that it may rely on Bluetooth. The current version connects to the web via Wi-Fi.Wingo says that the Bluetooth implementation could mean it would connect to Amazon Echo, the firm's line of ""smart"" speakers that include Amazon's virtual assistant Alexa.""It may mean the intersection between Dash and Echo, with more verbal commands to use Dash buttons,"" Wingo said.ITG Investment Research analyst Steve Weinstein released a research note Thursday which said that Amazon is on track to a ""modest"" revenue beat in Q1.The company has also been criticized for the amount of cardboard it generates, along with other e-commerce rivals.Amazon stock was down a fraction to 597 in early afternoon trading on the stock market today. The company has an IBD Composite Rating of 78, where 99 is the highest.

335,EBAY,"Stocks turned red after the Fed released its monetary policy statement midday Wednesday, and sold off hard into the close.The major averages didn't close at their session lows, but the losses were still big, with the Nasdaq sinking 2.2%, the Dow Jones industrial average falling 1.3%, and the S&P 500 giving up 1.1%. Volume was sharply higher across the board, according to preliminary data. Losers trumped winners by a 3-2 margin on the NYSE and 5-to-2 on the Nasdaq.Stocks were narrowly mixed ahead of the Fed statement. As widely expected, officials left the key interest rate unchanged. But a change in its phrasing suggests the Fed may not raise rates as previously indicated.On the economic front, new-home sales rose 11% from November to an annualized rate of 544,000 in December, well above estimates for 500,000. That gave IBD's homebuilder group an early boost, but it faded to a loss by the end of the session. Online travel bookers, biotechs and automakers were among the biggest losers, while gold miners, energy and banks gained.After the close, eBay (EBAY) was down 9% in late trading. The auction site reported Q4 results that met views on the top and bottom lines, but offered disappointing guidance for the current quarter. The stock is 11% off its high and trading below its 50-day moving average.Facebook (FB), however, soared 8% after its Q4 earnings and revenue trumped forecasts. The social network reported 1.59 billion monthly active users, above views for 1.58 billion. Daily active users rose 17% year over year to 1.04 billion; mobile daily active users jumped 25% to 934 million.Apple (AAPL) and Boeing (BA) dragged down the Dow with respective losses of 7% and 9% after disappointing quarterly results. Apple gapped down at the open and closed at its lowest level since August 2014. Fiscal Q1 iPhone sales of 74.78 million, reported late Tuesday, were shy of consensus forecasts for 75.2 million.Early Wednesday, Boeing reported mixed Q4 results and offered weak 2016 guidance. Shares gapped down and plunged to 15-month lows in massive volume.Hawaiian (HA) led the IBD 50 as it gapped up and soared 11% to retake its 50-day line in fast trade. The stock is extended past a 25.69 buy point, which it held well above even during its recent decline. Deutsche Bank raised its rating to buy from hold and boosted its price target to 4o from 35.Amazon.com (AMZN), Caterpillar (CAT), Ford (F) and Visa (V) are among companies reporting quarterly results Thursday. Economic data due out Thursday include December durable goods orders, weekly jobless claims and pending home sales for December.

336,EBAY,"PayPal (PYPL) beat Wall Street's Q4 top- and bottom-line expectations on solid payment volume and customer account growth.After the close Wednesday, the payments company said Q4 sales rose 17% from the year-earlier quarter, to $2.6 billion, with 1% of that growth stemming from its Xoom acquisition, completed during the quarter. The company reported earnings per share minus items of 36 cents, up 21%. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected 35 cents EPS ex items on sales of $2.51 billion.PayPal stock was up 5% in after-hours trading on the earnings news.""In Q4, we acquired more customers than any other in PayPal’s history,"" PayPal CEO Dan Schulman said on the company's earnings conference call with analysts.He also said that nearly 30% of the payments made on PayPal's platform last year were from a mobile device.""In the face of a slow global economy and foreign exchange headwinds, PayPal exceeded its full year revenue, earnings and free cash flow commitments to shareholders,"" Schulman said in the company's earnings release. ""As money becomes digital and the world goes mobile, we see tremendous opportunity ahead to expand our leadership, transform the way people move and manage their money and deliver increased value to shareholders.""Last quarter, PayPal said it extended its partnership with Alibaba (BABA), started a limited pilot program that lets Alibaba's wholesale vendors accept PayPal. Alibaba is China's No. 1 e-commerce company.PayPal also announced a $2 billion stock repurchase program.""We have proven our ability to generate cash, and this share repurchase authorization demonstrates our confidence in our strategic plan and long-term growth,"" PayPal CFO John Rainey said in the earnings release.PayPal gave 2016 full-year guidance calling for EPS ex items of $1.45 -to $1.50, the midpoint shy of  the consensus analyst estimate of $1.49. PayPal gave revenue guidance only on a constant-currency basis. For Q1, the company expects EPS ex items of 34 cents to 36 cents, in line with analysts' 35-cent consensus.PayPal said it ended the year with 179 million active accounts, having added 6.6 million in Q4. It said total payment volume rose 23% in Q4 to $81.5 billion.PayPal stock is down more than 15% from the record high of 42.55 it touched on the first day of trading after it spun off from eBay, July 20. This was the San Jose, Calif.-based firm's second quarterly earnings report without eBay.EBay (EBAY) and PayPal split up into separate companies as of July 17, a move they had announced a year before under pressure from some shareholders, including activist investor Carl Icahn.PayPal announced progress in its strategy to monetize one closely watched businesses the firm recently acquired, peer-to-peer payments app Venmo. The app lets friends do things like split dinner bills, cabs and rent. PayPal said Venmo processed $2.5 billion in total payments last quarter, up 174% from Q4 2014.Since Venmo doesn't charge customers to send and receive money, Wall Street questioned how PayPal would make it profitable.PayPal, though, said Wednesday that it's testing a program where  Venmo customers now can use the app to pay for concert tickets on ticketing platform Gametime and meal delivery app Munchery, the first revenue sources for Venmo.""We made good progress in setting up the technological infrastructure to allow Venmo users to pay merchants,"" Schulman said on the earnings call. ""Venmo is not just another buy button. It is the most beloved way to pay for millennials. There is tremendous demand from merchants for pay with Venmo.""PayPal faces heated competition from a host of mobile payment platforms. Both Apple (AAPL) Pay and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google Android Pay are gunning for a big share of the U.S. mobile payment market, estimated at $8.71 billion this year.In an earlier interview, Anuj Nayar, PayPal’s senior director of global initiatives, told IBD the company is well prepared to handle competition from Apple and Google, since payments is the core business for PayPal and just a side business for those tech giants.Since the spinoff, PayPal has been free to pursue partnerships with some of eBay's competitors such as Amazon.com. But according to a CNet report, an Amazon-PayPal partnership isn't happening soon.""It's quite simple,"" Patrick Gauthier, an Amazon payments vice president  and a former PayPal manager, told the website. ""Amazon starts with the customer. If our customers were asking for it, it (PayPal) would have been on Amazon already.""Gauthier also told CNet that Pay with Amazon, which lets customers use their Amazon log-in on other retailer sites to buy goods, has ""over 23 million customers.""The company said it ended the year with 179 million active accounts, having added 6.6 million in Q4. It said total payment volume rose 23% in Q4 to $81.5 billion.PayPal stock is down more than 15% from the record high of 42.55 it touched on the first day of trading after it spun off from eBay, July 20.

337,EBAY,"Amazon.com (AMZN) posted its most profitable quarter in at least four years and record Q4 sales late Thursday; but when it didn't come close to meeting Wall Street's lofty expectations of an outsized 246% earnings gain, its shares were punished. Of course, Amazon's EPS did jump 122%, but the $1 reported was compared with the $1.56 that analysts had expected.…
"
338,EBAY,"Amazon.com (AMZN) shares plunged in early trading Friday, after the e-commerce leader late Thursday fell well short of earnings estimates and also came up light on revenue.Earnings per share shot up 122% vs. a year earlier to $1 a share, excluding various items. But that didn't come close to views for $1.56 among analysts polled by Thomson Reuters.Sales rose 22% to $35.7 billion, ending two quarters of accelerating growth and slightly missing forecasts for $35.98 billion. Revenue would have risen 26%, excluding foreign-exchange swings.Amazon.com stock was down 9.5% after the opening bell in the stock market today, near 575.Shares had closed up 8.9% to 635.54 in the regular session. The stock more than doubled in 2015, though like much of the rest of the market, it has struggled in January. As usual -- CEO Jeff Bezos has said that he will always put the customer before profits -- Amazon is spending heavily on its business, logging a 20.5% increase in operating costs to $34.6 billion.Bezos said in the earnings statement that 2015 was the first year the firm passed $100 billion sales and 300 million customers.Memberships in Prime, Amazon’s customer loyalty program which offers free two-day shipping and free video streaming among other services, grew 51%. Prime is one of the key drivers of the company’s core e-tail business.Prime has more than 50 million members in the U.S alone, according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners.Compared with Amazon's fast-growing sales, eBay (EBAY), the largest U.S.e-commerce rival, posted lackluster sales growth during the holiday shopping season. EBay also offered lower-than-expected guidance for 2016. Shares plunged 12.5% on Thursday, though Wells Fargo analyst Matt Nemer says that the sell-off was too hasty.In Q4 2015 Amazon said that Amazon Web Services, its cloud computing division, hauled in $2.4 billion in revenue, up 69% over the year-earlier quarter. In the earnings statement, the company said AWS is now available across 12 geographic regions around the world and that it launched 722 significant new services in 2015.Several analysts have upped their price targets in recent weeks because of AWS's strong performance and potential for growth. Credit Suisse analyst Stephen Ju believes that the company’s capital expenditures in cloud computing are going to begin to decrease in the near future.It’s worth noting that the firm faces vigorous competition from Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL), which recently hired former VMWare (VMW) CEO Diane Greene to lead the consolidated team.Microsoft shares rose in after-hours action after the software giant reported better-than-expected results, led by its Azure cloud unit. Alphabet, which reports Monday, fell 1% late.Though many analysts are bullish because of AWS, others have begun to speculate that the company is going to get into the shipping business and compete with the likes of FedEx (FDX) and UPS (UPS). Amazon has announced the purchase of a fleet of trucks to ferry goods between fulfillment centers. It's also rumored to be running a cargo-flight operation out of Ohio, leasing 767 jets, and it's even getting into the ocean-shipping business.The thinking, according to several analysts, is similar to how Amazon got involved in cloud computing: As a result of the firm's own needs -- holiday web traffic surges require enormous data centers -- it eventually realized that it could sell excess capacity at a substantial profit. It's possible in the future that people may be able to ""ship with Amazon.""""I would say that what we’ve found, that to properly service our customers at peak, we need to supplement our partners' services,"" CFO Brian Olsavsky said on the call. ""It’s not meant to replace them. Carriers are no longer able to handle it at peak. We’ve had to add some resources on our own.""Amazon sees Q1 sales of $26.5 billion to $29 billion, or growth of 17% to 28%. The company does not offer EPS guidance but expects operating income of $100 million to $700 million, compared with $255 million a year earlier.Wall Street has forecast Amazon will earn 77 cents a share non-GAAP on revenue of $27.7 billion.

""While there may be any number of lucid arguments supporting the strategic rationale of a combination, we believe many of the benefits could have been achieved through arm's length/strategic partnership and without the risks inherent in exposing Tesla shareholders to the financial and capital markets risks faced by SolarCity.""Tesla late Tuesday made a surprise offer to buy solar energy company SolarCity in a stock swap valued at roughly $2.7 billion. Tesla CEO Elon Musk is chairman of SolarCity, which is run by Musk's cousins.Tesla sharse fell 0.1% to 196.40 on Thursday after falling as low as 192.13 intraday.

EBay said revenue was $2.1 billion for the quarter, slightly ahead of the $2 billion view.In after-hours trading, eBay shares climbed more than 4% at one point to 25.49.

""But what's driving a lot of their growth, is not the traditional marketplace.""Of the total growth, Wingo said that the core marketplace accounted for only 3% -- StubHub, the company's event-ticketing platform, and its classified business made up the rest of the growth. EBay, once a major e-commerce force, has a ways to go to rival the likes of e-comm powerhouse Amazon.com (AMZN).""E-commerce is growing at 15%,"" he said. ""To really get the turnaround -- we're about halfway through an 18-month turnaround -- it would be nice to see some data to see that it is taking hold.""For the second quarter of 2016, eBay said it's expecting growth of 4% to 6%, or between $2.14 billion and $2.19 billion in sales. The company expects adjusted earnings per share of between 40 cents and 42 cents. Analysts see earnings of 44 cents a share on sales of $2.14 billion.As for eBay's future prospects, Wingo said, ""Historically they've gone through slow periods and then accelerated.""

343,EBAY,"A day prior to PayPal (PYPL) reporting its Q4 earnings -- the second quarter since its departure from parent company eBay -- a Monness Crespi Hardt analyst has upgraded the stock to neutral from sell.In a research note Monday, Hardt analyst James Cakmak wrote that at the moment PayPal stock is trading at an appropriate discount given the competitive risks the analyst outlined in his downgrade report Jan. 4.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters on average expect PayPal sales to reach $2.51 billion in Q4, with earnings of 35 cents per share. That would put revenue up 14% year over year; EPS would be up 21% according to an estimate from Canaccord Genuity analyst Michael Graham.PayPal started trading under its own ticker Jul. 20 of last year, after eBay (EBAY) spun the payments processor off.EBay had announced plans for the spinoff in 2014 -- in part because it was under pressure to do so from some shareholders, including activist investor Carl Icahn.PayPal stock was up about 1.6% near 32 in the stock market today, down 15% from late December and down 25% from its July high as a new spinoff.Apple (APPL) and Google -- its parent company is Alphabet (GOOGL) -- both have entered the payments sector with mobile products. Venture capitalist Alex Rampell has told IBD in the past that essentially the threat to PayPal has to do with how interested Apple is in its payments business vs. its more lucrative hardware division.“This is the Death Star coming,” Rampell said, referring to the planet-destroying battle station in “Star Wars.""In addition to corporate giants entering the payments fray, startups such as Stripe and Adyen pose risks to PayPal as well. Both firms offer developers easy-to-implement payments solutions.PayPal has an IBD Composite Rating of 81, where 99 is the highest.

346,EBAY,"Payment processor Square (SQ) crashed after its quarterly adjusted loss was wider than expected, reigniting questions about Jack Dorsey’s ability to lead two companies at the same time.Wedbush on Friday downgraded the stock to underperform and cut its price target to 9 from 11. The analyst projects that the company’s growth will decelerate over the next two years amid more competition and market saturation.Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs believes Square is still a buy despite the pullback, saying that “continued fundamental momentum should drive the stock to recovery as the company executes.”Shares plunged 21.7% in giant volume, hitting a more than two-month low.

348,EBAY,"The past decade felt like a volatile period that constantly sent investors scrambling in pursuit of safe havens. But there were still long stretches in which the market notched gains.One result was that growth mutual funds outperformed value funds, more of which traditionally invest in defensive and higher-yield stocks. Growth mutual funds averaged a 6.20% annual gain over the past 10 years. Value funds averaged a more modest 5.38%.Value funds did outperform for much of the financial meltdown period in 2007, 2008 and 2009. But financial services stocks -- the bulk of which fall into the value camp -- got clobbered during the downturn. In quarters in which growth funds outperformed, they tended to outperform by more than value funds did when they outperformed.Value funds led the way in Q1 -- and have led so far in Q2 -- but it hasn't been by enough to catch up to growth funds. If you had invested $10,000 in a cross-section of growth funds on March 31, 2006, after 10 years your money would have grown into $18,775. The same amount invested in a cross-section of value funds would have risen to $17,687.In those 10 years, the now-$12.2 billion Fidelity OTC Fund (FOCPX) was one of the best performing growth funds. It racked up a 10.28% average annual gain. The S&P 500 averaged a 6.91% yearly return in that span.Managed by Gavin Baker since mid-2009, the large-cap growth fund had 92% of its shareholders' money in U.S. stocks as of Feb. 29. Technology was its biggest sector by far, with a 57% weighting. Health care was next, with a 17% weighting.Facebook (FB) has been a key contributor recently. Shares are up 33% off their Jan. 20 low. The stock gapped up Thursday when the company reported earnings-per-share growth of 83%. EPS grew 16%, 33% and 46% in the prior three quarters, respectively.Trading around 119, Facebook is just above its 117.09 buy point.Facebook's Accumulation/Distribution Rating has improved slightly to D from E. That shows that that deep-pocketed institutional investors like mutual funds aren’t participating wholeheartedly in buying shares. That could change if the stock’s up-on-volume days start outnumbering its down-on-volume days.
"
349,EBAY,"Mobile ads continue to generate strong returns for the social network.PayPal (PYPL) is another recent contributor. Shares are up 25% since their Jan. 20 low.PayPal is below its 40.03 buy point, as gains sparked by its earnings report last week fade. There's no sell signal, but it's important for the stock to find support at its 50-day moving average, which it is testing now.So far, the 38.62 entry is holding up. The eBay (EBAY) spinoff is one of the leading players in the electronic payments industry.Nvidia (NVDA) is a third recent contributor. It's up 42% off a Feb. 11 closing low.The share price is extended from a 33.16 cup-with-handle buy point.EPS grew a respective 13%, 18% and 21% the past three stanzas.All three of those stocks have IBD Composite Ratings in the 90s. The Composite Rating combines IBD’s five performance ratings, including EPS and Relative Strength ratings.

"
355,EBAY,"It's just one example of how PayPal is venturing into the mobile payment game, but like numerous other forays the electronic money handler is making into this rapidly expanding realm of the digital marketplace, it holds immense promise.PayPal (PYPL) is trying to monetize Venmo, a sort of mobile payment processor with a social media soul. Venmo allows friends to send and receive payments from each other, which comes in handy when they want to split dinner bills or a taxi. The social media component comes in when users can chronicle their transactions and let friends know where they've been and what they're buying -- though they can hide amount details.It may not have the cachet of other social media sites like Facebook (FB) or Twitter (TWTR), but analysts say Venmo and other ventures like it are necessary for PayPal to remain relevant.""Venmo gives PayPal a strong inroad into millennials,"" William Blair analyst Robert Napoli told Investor's Business Daily. ""If you are a college student or are in your 20s, if you don’t have Venmo you’re an outcast.""Venmo handled $7.5 billion in transactions during 2015, up 213% from a year ago. Right now, that comprises a small part of the $282 billion in payments processed by PayPal last year, but that could easily change, he points out.""Venmo is growing very fast and now PayPal is monetizing it and allowing people to use their Venmo accounts to spend as opposed to just transferring money,"" said Napoli. ""It is not widely disseminated yet, but I expect it to be over the next year or so. Venmo is a very large opportunity for them.""PayPal is attempting to grow on a number of fronts, particularly its mobile segment and in-store mobile wallet. It is in the mobile wallet arena where PayPal competes with Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Google Android Pay and Apple’s (AAPL) Apple Pay, say analysts.PayPal was spun off from former parent eBay (EBAY) on July 17 and made its market debut on July 20. The online and mobile payments processor has had two straight quarters of double-digit sales and earnings growth and forecasts to continue to grow full-year profits by double digits through 2020.""As money becomes digital and the world goes mobile, we see tremendous opportunity ahead to expand our leadership, transform the way people move and manage their money and deliver increased value to shareholders,"" President and Chief Executive Dan Schulman said in the company's earnings release.PayPal has tapped into a number of growth opportunities in recent months. In November, it acquired Xoom, which enables consumers to send money, pay bills and send mobile phone reloads to family and friends around the world using mobile devices.At the Mobile World Congress last month, it announced a collaboration with European carrier Vodafone (VOD), where millions of PayPal’s European customers will be able to fund payments on Alphabet’s mobile operating system Android smartphones at Visa contactless terminals using the Vodafone Wallet. The service will start in Spain and expand to additional European markets later this year.PayPal also has extended its existing business relationship with Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holdings (BABA) by launching a limited pilot program to accept PayPal payments. It is geared toward select vendors who sell on Alibaba Wholesale, the business-to-business section of Alibaba’s website.PayPal’s technology platform company enables digital and mobile payments on behalf of consumers and merchants worldwide. In 2015, 23% of the 4.9 billion payments it processed were made on a mobile device.Consumers who use its payments platform can shop cross-border by sending payments in more than 200 markets worldwide and in more than 100 currencies. This enables merchants to extend their reach across borders to an expanded customer base. It had roughly 179 million active customer accounts as of Dec. 31. Its $282 billion in total payment volume last year was up 20% over 2014, according to a filing with the SEC.""Through partnerships, and our technology-agnostic approach, we are able to give merchants and consumers more flexibility and choice in how they want to pay and get paid,"" the company said in a press release.Its ""gateway"" products include our Payflow Payments and certain Braintree offerings. Braintree is a mobile payments platform that eBay acquired for $800 million in 2013. Braintree is the global payment platform for thousands of online and mobile commerce innovators including Airbnb and Uber.PayPal also offers consumer the ability to receive a line of credit through its PayPal Credit consumer products.Its business model has served the company well. In the fourth quarter, sales rose 17% from the year-earlier, to $2.6 billion, with 1% of that growth stemming from its Xoom acquisition. The company reported earnings per share, minus items, of 36 cents, up 21% from a year earlier.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect 2016 earnings to rise 18% to $1.49 a share. They see an 18% increase in 2017 and in 2018.What’s behind PayPal’s momentum?""PayPal has grown for the longest time,""  Wedbush analyst Gil Luria told IBD. ""They came up with a clever way to help merchants and consumers feel more secure about online payments, and they have been riding the growth of e-commerce since. And I don’t expect that to change. Because so many merchants accept it, it creates a very positive network effect and it’s going to be hard for anybody to disrupt it.""Luria sees three ""tangential"" areas PayPal is involved in that can help it grow beyond the growth of e-commerce. One of them is in cross-border remittance, a capability it gained when it acquired Xoom. He also sees an opportunity to grow its credit product business for consumers and business sellers. A third growth opportunity is in helping brick-and-mortar stores accept in-store mobile payments.""Their competitors have consistently failed to dislodge PayPal from its leadership position because they never really have done anything that PayPal hasn’t already done,"" Luria said.

But first-time Super Bowl advertisers Amazon.com (AMZN) and PayPal (PYPL) think that it's worth every penny.For PayPal, which until July was a unit of eBay, advertising on what's likely the largest single-day sporting event of the year comes at an auspicious time. ""If you look at our business today, we're in a big transformation,"" said Greg Fisher, vice president and head of global brand marketing.""The very nature of money is changing. Everything must really serve people. If you look at the Super Bowl it's a big moment for us to be able to tell that story, to tell that (story) of us leading that revolution.""Since the company has spun off from eBay, Fisher says, it's been trying to re-introduce the world to PayPal with an independent, strong voice and the hope that people will see the company differently.The Super Bowl 50 ad is just the beginning, Fisher says.

Though Amazon spokeswoman Brittany Turner declined IBD's request to interview an executive about the Seattle-based company's decision, the firm did supply a statement from Neil Lindsay, vice president of Amazon devices.“Echo has had an amazing reception from customers over the past year -- they love it,"" Lindsay said in the statement. ""We thought the Super Bowl was a great chance to tell even more people about what Echo and Alexa can do, and have some fun while doing it.”After the stock market close Thursday, Amazon released Q4 results that missed investor expectations. On Friday, Amazon stock reversed gains made during the trading day Thursday.Image provided by Shutterstock.

373,EBAY,"New money never sleeps -- or so February's first-ever PayPal (PYPL) Super Bowl ad asked viewers to believe.The aggressive spot was an attempt to tell the public that PayPal is the future of money. It was also meant to suggest to investors that good things lie ahead now that the company is once again on its own after being spun off from 13-year parent eBay (EBAY).PayPal, however, finds itself surrounded by some big companies with payments technologies that could disrupt its lead. Apple (AAPL), Square (SQ) and Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Google are among the companies building digital wallet technologies that compete in one way or another with PayPal.""The new campaign is the very positioning we did pre-IPO (in 2002),"" Eric Jackson, CEO of business technology company CapLinked, told IBD. Jackson was PayPal's first director of marketing and wrote a memoir about his time at the company.Companies in the payments sector often do business with one another. Many of the merchants signed up with Apple Pay have their payments processed by PayPal subsidiary Braintree, for example.""As the kids say, there are 'frenemies' in payments,"" Wedbush analyst Gil Luria told IBD.Still, PayPal stock was down more than 4% in late-afternoon trading Thursday on news that both Apple and  Starbucks (SBUX) are expanding the reach of their mobile payment systems, aiming to get a bigger edge on rivals such as PayPal and Google.Apple Pay will be included in Apple’s Safari browser in time for Q4 holiday shopping, reported Re/code. The payment system will continue to work with Apple’s fingerprint ID technology.At least one analyst didn't see a big impact on PayPal, however. “While this (Apple Pay-Safari) could represent some near-term headline risk for PayPal, we believe the competitive impact introduced by Apple Pay in-browser will be limited due to potential consumer and merchant adoption hurdles,” Jefferies analyst Jason Kupferberg said in a research report. “PayPal's own expedited checkout process, One Touch, is already in use by more than 250 of the top 500 internet retailers”Meanwhile, in many ways, Braintree's peer-to-peer payments app Venmo is in a position similar to PayPal in its own very early days. Instead of focusing only on its first market, person-to-person payments, Venmo -- like PayPal, which started out as a free service before it built enough heft to charge merchants -- is turning to merchant transactions to turn a profit.Targeting merchant transaction fees ""is not that much of a leap,"" Luria said. ""That's what Elon Musk and Peter Thiel (PayPal co-founders along with Max Levchin) did 15 years ago. It's not unprecedented to take the Venmo users and turn them into paying customers.""That PayPal would be able to unlock business opportunities previously inaccessible to it with eBay as its owner -- other e-commerce rivals didn't particularly care to give business to a competitor such as eBay -- was a notable selling point when the split-up was announced in 2015.PayPal executives say that the company has advanced in several ways that it couldn't while it was a part of eBay. The marketing campaign that the Super Bowl ad was designed to support might not have been a priority under eBay, says Juan Benitez, general manager and CTO at Braintree.Braintree powers payments behind fast-growing private companies such as ride hailing app Uber and alternative accommodations provider Airbnb. Analyst Luria says that most of Braintree's profit comes from those two firms. Uber and Airbnb were Braintree's top clients when it was part of eBay as well, but the separation has led to at least one marquee client: the fast-growing e-tail startup Jet.com. Its CEO, Marc Lore, aims to compete with Amazon.com by, like Amazon, offering free two-day shipping. EBay is another rival. ""Jet is something that maybe would have had a question or two asked before before the split,"" Benitez told IBD. In addition, he says that PayPal is expanding its pilot merchant program with China e-commerce leader Alibaba (BABA).ITG Investment Research analyst Steve Weinstein told IBD that PayPal's post-eBay success has much to do with the company bringing on new merchants while part of eBay, ""and that moment has continued."" He says that it's ""hard to tell"" whether things have changed since the split, since it's so recent.But according to Wedbush's Luria, the truth about PayPal's real post-eBay value is related to the spinoff's financials.""When the carving out was happening, when the separation was negotiated, the eBay board allocated a lot of the revenue to PayPal and expenses to eBay,"" he said. The reasoning, he says, is that PayPal was getting twice the multiple (price-to-earnings ratio), so every dollar of profit they put into PayPal was going to get twice as much market value.Luria said that beyond the financials, the split produced a ""freeing effect"" that has allowed the deals with Alibaba and Jet.com. ""It's now an easier decision to incorporate PayPal into merchant acceptance,"" he said.The split, says Luria, gave PayPal the ""power of focus."" PayPal no longer needs approval from eBay executives on important decisions.No doubt competition with tech titans in payments will remain fierce, but PayPal is in a strong position. With its base of 13 million active merchants, the company can achieve powerful network effects from that critical mass, which makes it a considerable challenge to unseat PayPal as payments king.CEO Jeff Bezos' mighty e-commerce firm Amazon.com has been competing with PayPal for 10 years via its own payments platform, with negligible results.""Now the subtlety is that Apple Pay and Android Pay have an advantage,"" Luria said. Because the companies integrate their payments into iOS and Android, respectively, the payment experience is seamless -- which is critical for digital wallets.PayPal executives say that Apple Pay and Android Pay are actually good for their company, since those services often use PayPal's Braintree to process transactions.Others, however, don't see PayPal walking arm in arm with Apple or Google. ""Embracing the advent of Android Pay and Apple Pay sounds a little hollow,"" former PayPal exec Jackson said. ""It sounds more like corporate spin than reality.""Both Apple and Google are able to position their payments systems as the default option on their own mobile devices and services, which could make things rougher for PayPal.But even if Apple and Google do it, Weinstein says, that move by itself would not be enough to unseat San Jose, Calif.-based PayPal from the payments lead.""PayPal has a lot of other products,"" he said.Analysts and industry watchers aren't sure how PayPal plans to tackle its challenges. Innovation is one strategy that's worked well in the past, such as with One Touch, the company's tech tool to reduce checkout time. Acquisitions have been helpful, too -- for example, the $800 million Braintree purchase, which included Venmo.Regardless of how PayPal proceeds, how it separates itself from its competition will be key, says Jackson. As the Super Bowl ad shows, PayPal has its game face on.

374,EBAY,"Gigamon is becoming a contender in the battle against cyber crime, as its portfolio of hacker-fighting products has lifted its financial performance and revved up investor enthusiasm.After posting losses and struggling for two straight quarters in the first half of 2014 with sales execution issues, Gigamon (GIMO) has come back strong amid growing momentum in the cybersecurity arena.It's beaten earnings forecasts six quarters in a row and enjoyed double-digit earnings growth the past five quarters. After a strong performance in 2015, Gigamon is expected to keep up its winning streak.Investors have been impressed. Gigamon's stock has soared 41% since it posted fourth-quarter results Jan. 28 with double-digit sales and profit gains that topped views and gave solid first-quarter 2016 guidance.""Investors saw a very strong December quarter come in significantly over consensus on both the top and bottom line,"" D.A. Davidson & Co. analyst Mark Kelleher told IBD.Gigamon helped its cause with last July's introduction of GigaSecure, which it claims is the industry's first security delivery platform. GigaSecure sales have been strong and are expected to stay that way as adoption rates increase, industry watchers say.Gigamon's good fortune comes as its business related to cybersecurity is heating up at a time when it has become such a high priority, says Kelleher.""The security market is an important driver to Gigamon’s growth,"" he said.Gigamon's products provide visibility and control of traffic across networks in an effort to enhance security. Gigamon's ""Visibility Fabric"" architecture and GigaSecure are two of the products touting advanced intelligence so that network security measures operate more efficiently and effectively.In the fourth quarter, nearly 50% of Gigamon's total business was related to security deployments, Chief Executive Paul Hooper said in a prepared statement. For all of 2015, more than 45% of Gigamon's sales were related to security in one form or another, compared with 36% in 2014, he said on the fourth-quarter conference call.In looking at the company's pipeline for 2016, the number of opportunities directly associated with security products is ""fast approaching"" 60%, he added.Said analyst Kelleher: ""Gigamon’s network visibility products watch what is going on in the network and pass along what they see to other tools (security for example) that need information to complete their task.""In addition to security, its products also monitor the network for other applications, such as network diagnostics, Kelleher says.But Hooper is optimistic about the company's role in combating security threats, describing Gigamon as ""an enterprise security company.""That's where GigaSecure comes in. GigaSecure is tailored toward providing information to cybersecurity application providers such as FireEye (FEYE).""The security portion of their portfolio has become increasingly important to the mix, most notably GigaSecure,"" Needham & Co. analyst Alex Henderson told IBD. ""GigaSecure has been phenomenally successful.""He cites the fact that in the third quarter -- the first quarter of the GigaSecure launch -- 25% of new customers purchased the GigaSecure package. He says deal sizes were twice the corporate average, and gross margins were about 9 to 10 basis points above the mean.""That's pretty impressive,"" Henderson said.In the fourth quarter, GigaSecure accounted for 35% of new customer sales. On top of that, deal sizes were four times the average for new customers.Henderson says Gigamon's pipeline of security orders coming into the first quarter suggests the percentage of customers buying GigaSecure continue to go up.The GigaSecure platform combines ""purpose-built"" hardware with custom software. GigaSecure makes security infrastructures more effective at identifying and reducing threats inside networks, the company says.It does so by providing users with ""pervasive visibility"" of network traffic, users, applications and suspicious activity, according to the company's website. It also delivers information to multiple security devices simultaneously without impacting network availability.The company says it also helps third-party security appliances, such as firewalls, become more effective at protection. Thus, the cost and complexity of security infrastructure is reduced.Gigamon has seen marked gains on the financial front. In the fourth quarter, earnings soared 61% from a year earlier to 29 cents a share. That followed a 450% rise the prior quarter. Revenue climbed 31% to $67 million, the fifth straight quarter of double-digit sales growth. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect earnings to increase 24% in 2016, followed by the same percentage jump in 2017.Gigamon's product portfolio has several key components, including a distributed set of physical and virtual Visibility Fabric nodes that collect and move traffic. So-called GigaSmart software applications also provide traffic intelligence and a Visibility Fabric management software layer called GigaVue-FM.GigaSmart software can perform a number of functions to provide the security applications with useful information, says Kelleher. One such function is ""decryption"" of data, he adds.Gigamon has multiple security vendors in its so-called ""Ecosystem Partner Program"" to combat cybersecurity threats.The company doesn't displace or compete with security tool vendors, Hooper said on the conference call. Rather, Gigamon ""increases the relevancy"" of the information they receive, he said. Gigamon has 60 companies in this partnership program, including Cisco Systems (CSCO), Palo Alto Networks (PANW) and FireEye.In fiscal 2015, it had more than 1,900 customers, up from approximately 1,600 customers in fiscal 2014.Its customers include giants such as eBay (EBAY), Intel (INTC), 3M (MMM), big banks, telecoms and retailers. It also serves government agencies.Kelleher expects Gigamon to keep up its strong momentum as it continues to ""innovate and add more functionality"" to its products.""I expect the company to continue to put up some very strong year-over-year growth rates,"" he said. ""I'm looking for another 20% upside to this year's revenue.""

375,EBAY,"As the tech industry gets ever more data-driven, a “Ph.D. in economics” is more often becoming a job requirement in the sector.Established giants and newer tech firms alike are enlisting economists to help with many crucial tasks. Companies that employ economists include Amazon.com (AMZN), Airbnb, IBM (IBM), Facebook (FB), Microsoft (MSFT), eBay (EBAY), Yahoo (YHOO) and Uber.Hal Varian was a consultant for Google (now part of Alphabet (GOOGL)) going back to 2002, becoming its chief economist in 2007. And the trend has grown, as tech economists say there’s more demand and appreciation for the work they do.Amazon is a leading employer of economists, with “dozens” aboard, says Susan Athey, a professor of the economics of technology at Stanford Graduate School of Business and a longtime consultant to Microsoft. Amazon didn’t respond to a request for comment.Athey says Microsoft is another company with “at least a dozen” economists on staff. She knows of nearly 100 economists employed by tech firms, the big majority joining after 2010.Tech company economists must combine theory with practical application.“We use economic principles and economic theory, but we also use experiments, statistical data and other aspects of the real world to build systems that work and will stand the test of time,” said Preston McAfee, chief economist at Microsoft.These systems can address fundamental business questions, such as setting prices, as well as challenges brought about or exacerbated by the rapid rate of innovation in the tech industry. As firms expand, economists are increasingly working on public policy issues, including privacy issues and intellectual property topics.Economists have to analyze large amounts of data. Much of their value to tech firms is in helping to connect the engineering side with the business side.“Economists are trained in the intuition and goals of business, but they are also comfortable with data, statistics and the technical aspects of running a business,” Athey said. “A successful economist is multilingual.”A tech firm today might hire an economist when they struggle to navigate a new marketplace.“You might confront a business problem where you realize there’s no off-the-shelf HBS (Harvard Business School) case study or McKinsey rule of thumb you can apply to manage your unique marketplace,” Athey said. “It’s really an economics research project to figure out the business practices to operate the new platform.”Economists have helped Uber develop its “surge” pricing algorithm -- basically, when demand exceeds supply, Uber’s prices rise -- and have led Airbnb to offer professional photography services for hosts. While the platforms are new, these problems come down to supply and demand.One of the biggest and most famous contributions of a tech economist is Varian’s work on AdWords. As his first assignment, Varian helped Google develop its auction-based approach to selling ads, still by far the company’s largest source of revenue.For economists, the fast-paced environment and variety of challenges are among the big draws of working in the tech industry.“I’m in this business because I don’t like routine. I relish having new challenges,” said McAfee. McAfee had been a professor for 28 years before leaving academia to join the tech industry in 2007 as chief economist at Yahoo.At Microsoft, McAfee is working to develop a new business model to sell technology developed by research units directly to customers, among various other tasks.“It’s a new take on a classic research model, and I’m happy to be a part of it,” he said.Varian had intended to stay at Google for a year while on leave from the University of California, Berkeley, but the excitement of the work at Google drew him away from academia.“We’ve got a great environment here where you have the infrastructure for developing projects and products,” said Varian. “Most of the things we’ve done have been of considerable interest to the company.”Besides AdWords, his other key tasks at Google included helping with its unusual “Dutch auction” style of IPO in 2004, designed to open the process to everyone and not just to favored clients of underwriters. He also collaborates with Google X, the company’s “moonshot” R&D factory, to help develop some of the business models.Michael Bailey, economics research manager at Facebook, looks at academia and tech as a difference between breadth and depth.“In industry, you are working on a larger variety of problems and projects and often need to take more multidisciplinary approaches so you are effectively building more breadth,” Bailey told IBD via email.Bailey, who joined Facebook directly after finishing his Ph.D., said his team is growing and that he expects the tech industry to continue hiring economists at a fast pace.Varian agrees. “A lot of people have developed an appreciation for the kind of economic analysis we do,” he said.The interest is mutual. Within economics, the community of people who study the high-tech economy has grown from a very small number to hundreds across academia, business and government over the last 10 years, Varian says.“We’re developing a new field of practicing economics in the real world,” said Microsoft's McAfee. “Some of our big successes have been in auctions and pricing, but there are many more of those to come. And I think that’s a very cool thing to be a part of.”

376,EBAY,"PayPal (PYPL), now untied from its prior owner eBay (EBAY), does not face a serious competitive threat in the near future, an analyst said Wednesday.At the Electronic Payments Summit in New York, panelists were ""generally bullish"" on the San Jose, Calif.-based company's chances at holding on to its market share, according to a research note from Jefferies analyst Jason Kupferberg. The analyst cites the company's installed base of 185 million consumers and 13 million merchants.""This represents a competitive advantage, which is reinforced by new products such as One Touch and Venmo,"" Kupferberg wrote. ""While some large merchants are still somewhat ambivalent about the benefits of PayPal, one panelist highlighted a 14% online sales increase for a big merchant once they implemented PayPal.""Kupferberg also wrote that large merchants are generally reluctant to have more than two checkout buttons or digital wallets available for shoppers because returns ""diminish beyond that number.""Competitors in payments, such as e-commerce leader Amazon.com (AMZN) and digital cash register and payments processor Square (SQ), have been aiming for a greater foothold in payments.Amazon has been at it for some time, but with little to show for it, according to Wedbush analyst Gil Luria.For its part, Square announced last week that it was adding Web checkout capabilities to its array of features, which is likely a direct challenge to PayPal's payments platform.Also at the payments summit, Kupferberg wrote that 10% mobile wallet penetration of U.S. in-store payments could be five years away. Firms such as Apple (AAPL) and Alphabet (GOOGL) unit Google, among others, have developed such technology.PayPal stock was up more than 1%, near 39, in midday trading on the stock market today. PayPal is an IBD Leaderboard stock and has an IBD Composite Rating of 93, where 99 is the highest. Shares are below a 40.03 entry but just above an earlier entry at 38.62.

377,EBAY,"PayPal (PYPL) stock jumped Thursday after the company posted a Q4 earnings beat after the close Wednesday, with executives dismissing Apple (APPL) Pay as no big threat to the company's payments business.PayPal stock was up nearly 8%, near 34, in early afternoon trading in the stock market today. PayPal has an IBD Composite Rating of 77, where 99 is the highest.RBC Capital Markets Daniel Perlin wrote in a research note that the quarter was ""solid,"" and that the company will continue to gain market share. He cited its recent Venmo acquisition -- a company that offers a peer-to-peer payment app popular with millennials for sharing restaurant tabs, rent payments and more.PayPal executives outlined a strategy to monetize Venmo on their Q4 earnings call, as the service is testing ways to generate revenue.In a research note Thursday, Jefferies analyst Jason Kupferberg described PayPal as a ""scarce investment opportunity."" The analyst says that it's a large-cap company growing sales in the mid-double digits, with improving margins and a global brand. He said it's a pure online-payments stock, in a high-growth sector.""PayPal continues to innovate around its core,"" he wrote.The strong Q4 results may reassure investors ""about the resilience of its business model and the strength of its brand,"" wrote BTIG analyst Mark Palmer in a research note late Wednesday.Palmer added that the $2 billion share buyback should also remind investors about the company's ""robust"" free cash flow, as well as offer ""downside protection.""""PayPal is going out of its way to actively emphasize its payment agnostic philosophy to other players in the payments ecosystem, making it clear that it's not seeking to disintermediate them,"" Nomura analyst Bill Carcache wrote in a research note. ""This approach is giving rise to discussions that are more partnership-oriented rather than antagonistic.""Anuj Nayar, PayPal’s senior director of global initiatives, echoed this in a recent interview with IBD, saying that PayPal is the only service that's ""cross-platform"" and ""device agnostic.""On the company's Q4 earnings conference call, PayPal CEO Dan Schulman said the company collects transaction data from Apple Pay and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google Android Pay -- many merchants use (PayPal-owned) Braintree to process transactions -- suggesting that the company has significant insight into its competition. ""We have really good insight as to those different services, but we wouldn't release it publicly,"" Schulman said.Whether that data help PayPal in the long run remains to be seen. Alex Rampell, a general partner at noted Silicon Valley venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, says that if Apple and Google decide to focus on payments it could ""create a huge problem"" for PayPal, precisely because of the reason Nayar and Schulman cite as an advantage: PayPal does not control the hardware and software.Apple's hardware business if far more profitable than payments, Rampell says, so the company might not go all-in on payments.PayPal's Q4 results are the second since the company spun off from eBay (EBAY) in July. EBay did not fare as well in Q4, disappointing Wall Street.

378,EBAY,"The major indexes closed near session highs as stocks rebounded Thursday from the prior session's rout, powered by strong earnings reports and rising oil prices.The Nasdaq led with a 0.9% jump, while the Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.8%, and the S&P 500 gained 0.6%. Volume was mixed: slightly lower on the NYSE and higher on the Nasdaq, according to preliminary figures.Oil stocks scored big gains as West Texas Intermediate crude rose 4% to $33.67 a barrel. Oil stocks surged early after Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said Saudi Arabia had suggested production cuts. Internet stocks and apparel makers also rallied, driven by upside earnings results.Facebook (FB) gapped up and soared almost 16% to a new closing high, vaulting past its 50-day moving average in fast trade. The social media giant was the top gainer on the IBD 50, after reporting Q4 EPS late Wednesday that rose 46% to 79 cents a share on a 52% revenue increase to $5.84 billion, well above views. It also saw an increase in the number of daily active users.Under Armour (UA) gapped up, jumping 23% and regaining its 50-day line in rapid turnover. It's still trading below its 200-day line and 20% off its high. The athletic apparel and shoe maker reported an upside surprise in Q4 earnings and sales.PayPal (PYPL) jumped more than 8%, also on a Q4 beat. But former parent eBay (EBAY) gapped down to sink more than 12% after reporting Q4 results late Tuesday and giving weak Q1 guidance.Two big-name companies reported after the close and headed in opposite directions. Amazon.com (AMZN), up 9% during the regular session, was down 12% after hours. The Internet retailer, expected to report record holiday sales, announced Q4 profit and sales that missed views.Meantime, Microsoft (MSFT) was up 5% after hours, following fiscal-second-quarter results that topped earnings and revenue forecasts. Shares climbed almost 2% ahead of the report. The stock closed the regular session 3% below its 50-day line and 8% off its Dec. 29 high.Chevron (CVX), MasterCard (MA) and Xerox (XRX) are all due to report quarterly results Friday.

380,EBAY,"Citigroup slashed its price target on LinkedIn and also lowered its targets on shares of Amazon.com (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), Facebook (FB) and Netflix (NFLX) in a report that takes a close look at the earnings dilution from stock compensation grants.Tech companies, and some others, typically report both non-GAAP (generally accepted accounted principles) earnings -- which exclude stock grants to employees, among other items -- and earnings under GAAP, which include everything. Financial analysts typically provide non-GAAP estimates for quarterly results, and those numbers frequently get more play in quarterly earnings stories in the business press.“We are adjusting our models and price targets to better reflect the impact of stock-based compensation (SBC),” said Citigroup analyst Mark May in the research report. “Some may say this is a bear market issue, but we believe it is a necessary change that is long overdue.”Citigroup cut its price target on LinkedIn (LNKD) to 130 from 194. It lowered Amazon’s price target to 760 from 780, Google-owner Alphabet's target to 900 from 924, Netflix to 116 from 121, and Facebook to 133 from 134. Citigroup maintained buy ratings on Amazon, Facebook and Google. It has neutral ratings on LinkedIn and Netflix.In morning trading on the stock market today, LinkedIn stock was near 115, Amazon near 597, Alphabet near 763, Netflix near 104, and Facebook near 115. All were up a fraction except Netflix, which was up 2%.The report also looks at the stock-based compensation of eBay (EBAY), Twitter (TWTR) and Yahoo (YHOO).“While most (investors) view Twitter as having the highest stock-based compensation ratio, LinkedIn’s grants as a percentage of revenue are higher than Twitter, and LinkedIn saw this ratio increase last year,” said the report. “While most view Amazon as having high stock-based compensation, it actually ranks near Netflix as among the lowest. Facebook ranks high, but grants declined last year, and its revenue growth, profitability and stock price performance provide important offsets.“The impact of stock-based compensation provides additional reason to remain cautious on LinkedIn and Twitter.“Unlike some people, we do not think stock-based compensation should be treated as a cash expense, mostly because it is in fact not a cash item. Instead, we account for it consistent with what it is -- an ongoing source of dilution to equity holders.”According to Citigroup, on a percentage of revenue basis, the company with the highest stock compensation grants in 2015 was LinkedIn, followed by Twitter, Yahoo, Facebook, Google, eBay, Amazon and Netflix, respectively.
"
381,EBAY,"The Internet revolution has automated manufacturing, retail fast-food service and even self-driving cars -- and now thanks to companies like Rubicon Project (RUBI), you can add advertising sales to that list.For many website users, online ads can be an annoyance -- albeit an important one that publishers can’t live without. What Internet users may not know is in the milliseconds that it takes for a web page to download, advertising prices have been negotiated, bought and sold, replacing the old world of haggling in person or over the telephone.That's the world Rubicon inhabits. Founded in 2007, the Los Angeles-based tech company has created an exchange -- much like the NYSE or Nasdaq -- that brings advertisers and publishers together in an online forum to negotiate prices. It also matches publishers, such as traditional news media and online video game services like Zynga (ZNGA), with the right advertisers.Perhaps somewhat brashly, Rubicon President Gregory Raifman said the company’s name harkens back to one of ancient history’s most pivotal moments: Julius Caesar’s fateful decision to defy the Roman government and march his army across Italy’s Rubicon River in 49 B.C. In modern terminology, “crossing the Rubicon” is to pass the point of no return.""It came from the notion of crossing the Rubicon for advertising,"" Raifman told IBD, ""and there was no going back.""Rubicon currently counts more than 1,500 publishers and 100,000 advertisers among its customers. It uses about 60,000 different algorithms to process more than 7 trillion requests per month.Its growing volume of publishers and advertisers creates a lot of data, allowing more efficiency in how prices are set, as well as attracting more buyers and sellers. The company also has introduced cloud computing to the world of advertising sales.""We’ve reached a scale where we’re beginning to separate ourselves,"" Raifman said.Since its initial public offering in April 2014, Rubicon's stock has risen 17%, and it’s up more than 6% so far this year. On March 2, Rubicon shares broke out from a cup formation.One of automation’s advantages is that it keeps labor costs down while generating more in sales. That helps to explain Rubicon’s muscular profits so soon after going public.In 2015, its full-year revenue nearly doubled to $248.5 million, while full-year earnings grew more than fivefold to $1.08 a share. In the fourth quarter, its $83.7 million in revenue beat estimates by $5.7 million -- and it crushed earnings views of 33 cents a share with a reported 72 cents.Last year, the company managed more than $1 billion in advertising, increasing its small-but-growing influence in the $170 billion digital advertising market.It’s still dwarfed by Alphabet (GOOGL) subsidiary Google and Facebook (FB), which sold a combined $87 billion in advertising in 2015. Those two tech giants helped grow their advertising businesses via acquisitions, while Rubicon Project has largely achieved its own growth organically.On Monday, Rubicon announced it’s working on a system that’s compliant with Google’s Accelerated Mobile Pages project. Earlier this month, the company announced a partnership with Mediaocean, a leading advertising software provider with 80,000 users, to expand its reach into the direct advertising market.That being said, acquisitions aren’t completely off the table. Last year, Rubicon bought Canada-based marketing firm Chango for $122 million.""Within digital, there is a growing amount that is done in a more automated fashion,"" said Brett Huff, managing director at Stephens.Helping Rubicon out is its leadership, namely founder and Chief Executive Frank Addante, whose vision of automating the buying and selling of advertising has driven the company since its inception. Addante’s prior history includes founding L90, an ad-serving company whose clientele included Microsoft (MSFT), eBay (EBAY) and Sprint (S).""Every time you have something new that you want to explore, these guys are working on it and are giving you the opportunity to put it on the same marketplace that you’re already familiar with,"" said Murali Sankar, an equity research analyst at Boenning & Scattergood.But the company is noted among analysts for looking before it leaps. While it may pass up some quick-hit opportunities at revenue growth, in the long run, things have paid off for them.""They don’t jump into the latest sizzling trend that comes along,"" said Sameet Sinha, an analyst at B. Riley. ""They take their time.""Besides macroeconomic challenges -- advertising budgets tend to get cut during recessions -- Rubicon faces ad-blocking software, which its president optimistically called an “opportunity.”It challenges them to find ways to improve ad quality in order to involve consumers instead of driving them away, Raifman said.The company’s future holds a move into mobile digital advertising, billboards and television, Raifman said. To do that, Rubicon needs to remain adept at the fast-changing world of digital ads, because things can change in a hurry.""What got us here isn’t guaranteed to get us there,"" Raifman said.

382,EBAY,"Is the person who viewed those leather boots on a laptop the same shopper who browsed the pricey footwear from a desktop but ended up buying the product using a tablet?That tricky question is behind the rise of cross-device tracking tools, and it's the reason why popular ""walled-garden"" sites like Facebook (FB) are gaining in the digital ad game.In the past, cookies were the universal bread crumbs of the Internet, helping advertisers find out which websites a particular user favored. Cookies are tiny text files that let websites recognize users -- usually by their IP (Internet protocol) address -- when they return to a website, thus learning their preferences. With this data, companies can serve targeted ads -- ads that they believe are most likely to lead to a sale.With the transition of Web users to mobile devices and apps, cookies aren't as effective, and advertisers are looking for new ways to identify users and learn their preferences.""When you understand who a user or person is, you can provide them with more relevant advertising or more personalized information if you are a publisher. That identity is potentially helpful to improve the experience,"" Greg Sterling, vice president of strategy and insights at the Local Search Association trade group, told IBD.Determining which exact ad prompted a shopper to buy, a process called attribution, ""is the holy grail of advertising right now. It's what everybody needs to understand,"" Anna Bager, senior vice president and general manager of mobile and video at the Interactive Advertising Bureau trade group, told IBD.Learning more about cross-device attribution is high on the must-do list for many ad pros this year, marketing firm Rocket Fuel said in a research report last month.A Rocket Fuel survey found that ad professionals also intend to learn more about data management platforms in 2016. DMPs help businesses get a panoramic view of their customers by collecting marketing information from a variety of channels, such as websites, emails and mobile ads.But first, advertisers want to be certain of just who those shoppers are.""The technology and the different methods to identify people across devices in the aggregate have become more sophisticated,"" said Sterling, who calls Facebook the leader in multichannel identification.""You have to sign in to use Facebook, so they will know if you're on a desktop computer, a laptop or a mobile device,"" Sterling said. ""They can provide whatever experience they want to provide because they know who you are, and there’s persistent identity there.""But Sterling says that the shift from using just one device to seeking content from a hodgepodge of desktops, laptops, tablets and smartphones has created ""blind spots (where) people are not revealed to a Website publisher or a marketer. Somebody may sign in on one site and then go on to use the site on a mobile device and not sign in.""This trend is putting cross-device technology into the spotlight, as digital advertising, including mobile advertising, continues to boom. One trend is programmatic ad buying, where software determines ad buying and placement. It works best with ads targeted to user preferences, no matter the device used.Market research firm eMarketer estimates that programmatic digital display ad spending in the U.S., which reached $15.43 billion last year, will rise to $21.55 billion this year and $26.78 billion in 2017.Paris-based ad tech firm Criteo (CRTO) says its cross-device advertising tools work anywhere online, including on the mobile Web and inside apps.While cookies are a common standard used to identify and follow users in a browsing environment, that information can be “captured through other mechanisms when you are in applications,” Criteo CFO Benoit Fouilland told IBD. “Our technology focuses on predicting the behavior of the user based on shopping intent information. That’s an area where we are developing pretty unique capabilities.""There are not many players in the industry able to develop cross-device capabilities. We are one of those few companies and we are investing significantly in this area of what we call ‘universal matching.’ ” Top social networks Facebook and Twitter (TWTR) are expected to emerge as big winners in 2016, as digital display-ad spending, which includes mobile ads, overtakes search-ad spending in the U.S. for the first time, according to separate reports this year from Cowen and eMarketer.  Google owner Alphabet (GOOGL) is seen as another winner, with its browser and slew of email, search and other services that have users logging in with their Google passwords.Facebook remains a dominant pick of the ad buyers surveyed, Cowen's report said, followed by Twitter, LinkedIn (LNKD), Facebook-owned Instagram and privately held social sites Pinterest and Snapchat.EMarketer predicts that 2016 will be pivotal for Facebook; it's the first year in which more than half of the U.S. population is expected to use the social network. Facebook will capture 73% of social network ad spending in the U.S., or $9.9 billion, this year, eMarketer said last month. Twitter will be a distant No. 2, getting 14% of social network ad dollars, or $1.9 billion.The research firm also says that nearly 53% of U.S. mobile phone users will log onto Facebook at least once a month this year.Google is expected to remain No. 1 in 2016, with a 33.3% share of mobile ad revenue globally, eMarketer said in a report in March. It says that No. 2 Facebook's share will reach 17.7% this year.To learn user identities across devices, measurement companies rely on two methods -- ""deterministic"" and ""probabilistic.""Deterministic matching is at the core of the formidable cross-device matching success of Facebook, Google, Amazon.com (AMZN), eBay (EBAY), Twitter and other so-called Walled Garden sites, eMarketer analyst Lauren Fisher said in an online seminar in January. Walled Gardens are websites and apps that require passwords for entry and have a treasure trove of information about users, making it easier to match consumers across multiple devices. So, in a nutshell, trackers can pretty much determine who a user is.In being able to identify users, Walled Gardens are ""not 100% percent, but press close,"" Fisher said in the seminar. ""Think about it -- even now retailers are making a practice of requesting email addresses when you check out in a store.""If I have Facebook on my tablet, on my phone, on my laptop at home and on my work computer, then Facebook knows all those devices belong to me because I'm logged in and they're using that login to tie everything together.""Fisher says eMarketer believes ""advertisers are going to continue to flock to the Walled Gardens throughout 2016.""While nearly foolproof, the shielded deterministic method used to match, measure and target customers can't be used on Web properties outside of the Walled Gardens.That's where probabilistic identity matching comes in.Companies using the probabilistic method analyze wider, non-proprietary digital tip-offs that people leave behind online when they have not used a sign-in. Such data could include which Web browser version a person uses, their physical location and their go-to content sites through use of cookies and such technology. With these methods, tracking is a more of a probable than a determined fact.""When companies start to collect that information and analyze it over time, they can begin to say with a certain amount of probability that a particular device belongs to a specific individual,"" Fisher explained.Some Web publishers rely on both the deterministic and probabilistic methods to cross-check and boost their device matching accuracy, Fisher said.""The bottom line,"" said Fisher, ""is there's no right or wrong approach.""

384,EBAY,"EBay (EBAY) is set to beat Wall Street's Q4 consensus expectations, some analysts say, but they add that shoppers seem to be turning away from the e-commerce company.StubHub — eBay's online tickets marketplace — is making a comeback and is poised to stimulate the company's growth in Q4 and into 2016, ITG analyst Steve Weinstein wrote in a research note Wednesday. In late Q3, eBay shifted Stubhub away from ""all-in"" pricing, which is when the full price of a ticket, including service fees, is displayed while browsing the site. Now, Stubhub tacks on a 15% to 17% surcharge right before checkout.Weinstein expects Q4 revenue will beat Wall Street estimates, but the analyst says the San Jose, Calif.-based firm's core business remains challenged. ""We continue to view core eBay growth as disappointing when compared to other e-commerce companies. We believe the sustained underperformance reflects confused brand identity and an inability to provide a compelling experience for buyers and sellers,"" he wrote.EBay CEO Devin Wenig has acknowledged such issues. ""We have a lot of work ahead of us to reposition our business,"" Wenig said on the company's Q3 earnings call with analysts. ""Our efforts will take time. We're doing what we said we would do.""Weinstein estimates eBay's marketplace revenue will rise 0.3% in Q4 vs. Q4 2014, to $1.835 billion — just above the Wall Street consensus estimate of $1.833 billion.Michael Graham, a Canaccord Genuity analyst, says consumers seem to be getting their shopping experiences on Alphabet 's (GOOGL) Google Shopping and at Amazon.com (AMZN). He says that has pushed eBay into the ""bargain hunting"" market.Graham says eBay could buy back shares to help boost its stock, since it has ""quite a bit of cash.""EBay stock rose more than 1% in the stock market today.

387,EBAY,"On eBay (EBAY), you can buy one year's worth of work -- to be completed in little more than four months.While that listing may be a joke -- it appears not to be -- over the years eBay has garnered fame and infamy for the sometimes weird items and services people have listed on the popular e-tail website. And last week was no different.On Feb. 25, a prankster listed Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sissi on the site after the president reportedly said, ""By God, if it were possible for me to be sold, I would sell myself,"" in an address on state television. His condition was listed as ""slightly used"" and the seller would not accept returns. Bidding surpassed $100,000 before eBay pulled the listing.Unlike many of eBay's e-commerce rivals such as Amazon.com (AMZN), Wal-Mart (WMT) and even PayPal (PYPL), the San Jose-based company's platform is set up in such a way that bizarre items are almost inevitable (though it is worth noting that you can buy some pretty weird stuff on Amazon as well). In that spirit, here's a look at some of my favorite odd listings that have appeared on eBay:1. As noted above, this one is currently live on the site. Listed is ""one year of work equivalent to 2,000 hours of specialized labor over 4.25 months."" For $150,000 a ""loyal, dedicated and tireless contractor"" will labor 16 hours a day, seven days a week with no break or lunch -- for projects like painting, light construction work and ""bamboo plant propagation."" EBay spokeswoman Penny Bruce told IBD the listing is indeed in compliance with the company's policies.2. Another odd auction -- again, completely legit -- was the World's Largest BBQ Pit offered by a Texas man for the princely sum of $350,000. The 76-foot-long truck trailer has 24 barbecue pit doors, a walk-in cooler, beer taps and a ""place for stereo equipment"" and TV. The truck cab was an extra $50,000. It sold.3. In 2004, a man tried to sell an F-18 warplane via eBay for $1 million. Ultimately, the fighter jet did not sell -- it used to be a Blue Angel-owned aircraft -- but it did attract the attention of the FBI, which told the seller that the plane had to remain in the U.S.4. The last of our favorite weird items sold via eBay is a letter that Nobel Prize winning physicist Albert Einstein sent to philosopher Eric Gutkind shortly before Einstein's death. The letter references philosophical and theological themes, and expresses Einstein's belief that God does not exist. It sold for ... $3 million.

389,EBAY,"Alphabet (GOOGL), which owns search leader Google, could collect least $3.5 billion in new tax benefits if Intel (INTC) succeeds in its longstanding international tax dispute with the Internal Revenue Service, according to the Wall Street Journal.
"
390,EBAY,"The speculated amount exceeds Google’s entire 2015 tax cost, according to a report Monday by the Journal.Alphabet, Intel and the IRS all declined to comment.""If Google is $3.5 billion, there must be many other companies that have billions of dollars at stake on this issue,"" Reuven Avi-Yonah, a tax law professor at the University of Michigan, told the Journal.Alphabet is ""paying a huge amount of attention to this case, because this is probably the largest unresolved tax issue that high technology companies now have,"" Eric Ryan, a partner at the law firm DLA Piper, told the newspaper.The broader tech industry is also watching the case, which the IRS appealed to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last week.At least 20 companies, including Microsoft (MSFT) and eBay (EBAY), have disclosed that they also are monitoring the outcome of the case involving share-based compensation, according to the report. The dispute has been brewing since 2003, part of a battle between the IRS and companies over what are known as cost-sharing arrangements between U.S. corporations and their low-taxed foreign subsidiaries.In its annual report, Alphabet recorded a potential $3.5 billion benefit, citing a lower court's ruling. That was offset by a $3.5 billion deferred tax liability, meaning it didn't result in a major one-time boost to the company's earnings, the Wall Street Journal said.In its 10-K, Alphabet said it couldn't take the whole tax benefit because it hasn't decided whether it can and would put any gains, should Intel win, into its own offshore subsidiaries -- keeping its money outside the reach of the U.S. The company could record the benefit after the court case concludes.Intel inherited the case from Altera, which it acquired last year. That case involved about $80 million in corporate expenses from 2004 to 2007, according to the U.S. Tax Court decision.Altera's dispute was about whether share-based compensation -- but not salaries -- should be included in those costs. Altera challenged an IRS regulation stating that share-based compensation must be included in the cost-sharing pool. The IRS regulation meant that the foreign company had to pay for this and deduct the amount from its lower-taxed income, said the Journal.Alphabet stock was up a fraction in early afternoon trading in the stock market today, near 728. This month, Alphabet posted a Q4 earnings beat, but revenue from the company's stable of speculative, non-search-related ""other bets"" missed analyst expectations.Image provided by Shutterstock.

394,EBAY,"Based on a survey of 1,000 PayPal (PYPL) customers, an analyst says that the company isn't getting enough credit for the potential impact of its peer-to-peer payments app, Venmo.According to Jefferies analyst Jason Kupferberg, investor concerns over the Apple (AAPL) Pay competitor are exaggerated -- PayPal's mobile sales continue to grow and have, in fact, accelerated since Apple released its payments app, he says in a research note.Venmo is a mobile app that enables friends and family to share expenses such as rent, meals and cab fare.Google, a unit of Alphabet (GOOGL), also competes in the payments game with its Android Pay.Though PayPal executives continue to emphasize the firm's ""platform agnostic"" approach -- it isn't tied to an operating system or platform -- and say that neither Apple nor Google is a real threat, some industry watchers disagree.Alex Rampell, a general partner at noted VC firm Andreesseen Horowitz, likened the prospects of either Apple or Google taking a bigger interest in payments to the Death Star -- the planet-destroying battle station in ""Star Wars"" -- approaching for all other rivals.""This isn't the 'Empire Strikes Back,' ” Rampell has told IBD in the past. ""This is the Death Star coming.""Kupferberg wrote in a research note Monday that PayPal earnings will accelerate due to transactions conducted with the Venmo app.Venmo is free for now, but PayPal executives say that they plan to monetize the app, which is popular with millennials. They say that PayPal plans to allow selected PayPal merchants to accept payment via the Venmo app -- and PayPal would charge its typical transaction fee (2.9%, according to Fortune magazine) in the process.According to Kupferberg, 67% of Venmo users would use the Pay With Venmo feature one or twice a month, with 44% using it three to five times a month, and 19% using it six to 10 times per month.Kupferberg says that Pay With Venmo transactions will yield larger profit margins because Venmo customers typically fund their accounts with debit cards, bank accounts and stored balances -- the result of others sending cash.PayPal stock was up more than 2%, near 38, in afternoon trading on the stock market today. The San Jose-based company has an IBD Composite Rating of 91, where 99 is the highest.The stock has had a choppy few months since its spin-off from eBay (EBAY) in July. It hit its high of 42.55 during its first trading session on Nasdaq and has plunged to as low as about 30 on several occasions. At least one analyst says that the sell-off has been too hasty.Kupferberg's price target for PayPal stock is 44.PayPal has recently settled a lawsuit over a perennial issue that the company faces: locked accounts.

396,EBAY,"With the lofty goal of delivering vast swaths of his mighty e-commerce firm's sprawling inventory within one hour, Amazon.com (AMZN) CEO Jeff Bezos has struck cybergold -- shoppers have flocked to the latest iteration of his Amazon Prime loyalty program, Prime Now.Amazon executives have described rapid delivery as both difficult and expensive -- and have acknowledged that customers love it. And Amazon loves its customers, so much that Bezos repeatedly has said the company will forego profits to please them.Cowen & Co. Tuesday released results of its survey of 1,200 Amazon Prime customers that it says shows one in four already have adopted Prime Now. It's basically free. With order via a mobile app, Prime Now will deliver a large number of Amazon-bought goods within two hours in areas of the nation where the service is available. Customers can use the app for one-hour delivery as well, but there's a $7.99 charge for that.Prime Now is one Amazon salvo in a multiyear campaign to snatch more of the household budget.Amazon.com stock was up more than 3.5%, near 573, in afternoon trading on the stock market today. The company carries an IBD Composite Rating of 78, where 99 is the highest.Cowen analyst John Blackledge, in the research report, says that Bezos' approach with Prime Now complements Amazon's same-day and two-day services, and adds more value to its grocery operations Pantry and Fresh.Wal-Mart (WMT) -- by far the largest brick-and-mortar retailer -- makes bank on its grocery business, which accounts for about half of its top line, according to ChannelAdvisor (ECOM) Executive Chairman Scot Wingo.But Amazon is encroaching on Wal-Mart's business. ""We view Prime Now as one of the pathways Amazon is using to gain share in the $1 trillion grocery market,"" Blackledge wrote. ""Our early survey work suggests the strategy is working.""The survey indicated that 70% of those responding bought goods via Prime Now multiple times a month -- and about a third of shoppers bought groceries from a local store that elected to list its items on Prime Now. The service is available in 24 markets that account for nearly half of the U.S. gross domestic product, says Blackledge. Food delivery is available in seven markets.Prime Now's success is also a blow to eBay (EBAY), which continues to struggle to maintain relevancy for shoppers. Plagued by problems such as a significant data breach and SEO challenges following a change in Alphabet (GOOGL) subsidiary Google's search engine algorithm, eBay has been unable to match Amazon's double-digital growth rate.Disagreeing with recent investor sentiment -- eBay stock has had a choppy beginning to 2016 -- Wells Fargo analyst Matt Nemer says that eBay has potential, albeit as a hedge against a potentially slowing global economy. And for its part, eBay has been making significant bets on restructuring the way it lists items.But as Amazon continues to innovate its way to riches, some say that its position as the dominant e-tailer is impenetrable.That hasn't stopped rivals, however. Privately held Jet.com is making a stab, also offering two-day shipping, and Alibaba (BABA)-backed ShopRunner is also taking aim at Amazon.ShopRunner executives have told IBD that the company plans to take on Amazon in categories where the Seattle-based company doesn't have a strong foothold, such as fashion.

397,EBAY,"Though Amazon.com (AMZN) stock has had a rough week, shares more than doubled in 2015 and touched a record high of 696.44 on Dec. 29. But analysts are beginning to question whether investors have already priced in the e-tail leader's growth potential.Wall Street expects earnings per share gain to nearly triple to $1.65, but Canaccord analyst Michael Graham says most of the positives that have sparked Amazon's recent growth already are baked into its current stock price. On Wednesday, Graham reiterated a hold rating on Amazon stock.""I've been a fan of Amazon forever,"" Graham told IBD. ""They are doing so many things right, continuing to gain market share — becoming a key place households go to spend a lot of their income. But at this point in time, a lot of that positive stuff is reflected in the stock price already.""Amazon.com stock gapped down on Monday, piercing its 50-day moving average on double its average daily volume. That was a sell signal, and so is the stock's 8% decline from its most recent flat-base buy point of 684.92, touched last month.In afternoon trading in the stock market today, Amazon stock was down 0.8%, near 629. Amazon has an IBD Composite Rating of 95, where 99 is the highest.On Monday, Monness Crespi Hardt downgraded the stock from to neutral from buy, citing slimming margins and intense competition in the cloud computing sector.Canaccord rates Amazon a triple-plus — the best possible rating, and up from a double-plus in Dec. — citing three positive indicators across quantitative factors, metrics, and investor sentiment. Graham said that this method of rating stocks is common among buy-side analysts.""They recognize that competition on price is not the best long-term strategy,"" Graham said, ""and that having an efficient, modernized fulfillment network — which required a tremendous investment — is something that few companies are going to be able to match. ""Retailers such as Wal-Mart (WMT) and Target (TGT) have invested in order fulfillment but do not yet have the same capabilities. Because eBay (EBAY) relies on third-party sellers for its listings, fulfillment times vary — and that's not likely to change in the immediate future.Amazon Web Services (AWS), the e-tailer's cloud computing division, has also been a source of growth. ""AWS has the potential to lift overall margins,"" Graham said. But he points out that AWS faces two large opponents — Microsoft (MSFT) and Google (GOOGL) — with deep pockets, huge balance sheets and growth ambition.Many analysts disagree, however. According to a poll conducted by Thomson Reuters of 44 analysts surveyed, 37 rated Amazon a buy or strong buy.

414,EBAY,"Investors sent Etsy (ETSY) surging as the online crafts marketplace beat Wall Street's expectations for its Q4 sales -- an important quarter because of holiday sales.The Q4 sales haul reported Wednesday morning was up 35% to $87.9 million and Etsy reported a loss of 4 cents per share ex items. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected a 1 cent per share loss and sales of $86.5 million.Etsy is an online marketplace for uniquely crafted and curated goods from individual sellers. As such, Etsy has a narrower focus than much larger competitor eBay (EBAY), though like eBay it maintains no physical warehouses or distribution mechanisms. E-commerce giant Amazon (AMZN) has edged in on the crafts business idea, launching its Handmade at Amazon program last year.Etsy stock was up 6% to around 8 in afternoon trading in the stock market today. Etsy has a low IBD Composite Rating of 23, where 99 is the highest.Etsy's chart has been a slippery slope. Debuting with an 88% pop from its April 16 IPO -- it was priced at 16 and surged to as much as 35.74 in its first trading day-- the stock has steadily declined. Though there were occasional pops, they were short-lived; even with the frenzied buying in the wake of Q4 earnings, Etsy stock still sits nearly 80% off its one-time high.Analysts are cautious about the stock but believe some upside is coming. ""We believe growth will converge with overall e-commerce growth over the next couple of years as seller growth diminishes and marketing spend delivers declining yields,"" Wedbush analyst Gil Luria wrote in a research note Thursday.Company executives offered 2016-18 compound annual growth guidance of 20% to 25% for revenue and 13% to 17% for gross merchandise sales. Etsy said 2016 should come in at the high end of the range for revenue and around the midpoint for gross merchandise sales. Thursday afternoon analysts polled by Thomson Reuters were modeling for about 25% revenue growth for 2016.Gross merchandise sales is the total dollar value of the goods sold over the Etsy platform.The analyst also noted that Etsy's marketing spend grew 56% and its digital spend by 86%. ""We believe management is content with the return on investment on this spend, this gap (between marketing and gross merchandise sales) is unsustainable and growth rates will be tested as marketing spend diminishes as a percent of revenue in 2016 (per guidance),"" Luria wrote.Luria maintained his neutral rating and 12-month price target of 9.Etsy's gross merchandise sales for 2015 came in at $2.39 billion vs. eBay's gross merchandise volume of $82 billion.After eBay's Q4 results, investors went into sell-off mode, sending the stock plunging. Shares were up 1.5% in afternoon trading Thursday. Wells Fargo analyst Matt Nemer wrote in a research note that investors may have overreacted to the earnings.Luria said the guidance was lower than what he expected.“In our view, eBay shares are one of the few inexpensive ways to play defense in a slowing consumer environment,” he wrote, adding that executives did not alter the firm’s outlook for its core business.Nemer acknowledged that eBay is in a “transition period,” but he says that in the long run the firm is a “highly stable, flexible, data-driven business that should provide some downside protection in the current environment.”

416,EBAY,"The practice of shopping for high-end makeup has not yet gone the way of book-buying and succumbed to the weight of Amazon's (AMZN) can't-beat-'em discounts and free shipping — contrary to the hand-wringing over the 2013 launch of the e-tailer's luxury beauty portal.In fact, specialty beauty retail leaders Ulta (ULTA) and Sephora are doing just fine. More than fine, if anything.Ulta shares hit a new intraday high of 188.48 on Dec. 17, and Sephora continues to shine for luxury parent LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton (LVMUY).So what elusive ""It"" qualities does the specialty beauty industry have that make customers immune to the charms of Amazon?For one thing, it offers something that the pure-play e-commerce giant, by definition, can't offer: a satisfying in-store experience.""It's like a good glass of wine,"" said Piper Jaffray analyst Stephanie Wissink. ""You can find yourself in your own space for a period of time. That 15 minutes is glorious.""Vanity FairWalking into a Sephora is a bit like wandering backstage at a Victoria's Secret runway show — it's all flattering vanity lighting and glossy makeup kits and the tacit promise of looking like Gisele Bundchen upon exit. Ulta comes equipped with full-service salons and Benefit Brow Bars in-store for those seeking the full makeover-montage experience.""Ulta and Sephora provide a place to play,"" said Wissink, adding that there's an ""intangible benefit"" of being in the store.A Beautiful EducationPlus, the ""test-and-trial"" nature of beauty products prompts first-time buyers to head to a brick-and-mortar shop instead of ordering online, she said.Testers and samples abound at beauty stores. Buying items like lipstick and eye shadow on the Internet is a tricky business — what appears to be one shade in one's browser can be very different from what appears in one's mailbox.There is, however, potential for Amazon to steal share when it comes to replenishing products.""In theory, (cosmetics) should be the perfect online business,"" Nomura analyst Simeon Siegel told IBD. ""On the other hand, even repeat customers will walk into these stores and find new products all the time. There will always be an element of discovery with cosmetics.""YouTube and beauty bloggers offer a fairly well-rounded education online, for those willing to dedicate the time to it. But deciphering the latest makeup application techniques — think contouring or strobing — can be a little overwhelming.Ulta, which sells both mass brands like Revlon and L'Oreal, in addition to luxury brands like Urban Decay and Smashbox, offers makeup consultations at no charge. Sephora holds free makeup classes that conveniently allow shoppers some time to buy newfound products before the store officially opens for the day.No Seasons — Or DiscountsBeauty has the added buffer of not being a seasonal industry, say analysts, which keeps prices in check. Makeup colors keep changing, but the products generally remain the same. A facial cleanser knows no season. An acne cream is a year-round need.Contrast this to the season-dependent world of apparel, where fast-fashion retailers are pressuring traditional department stores and clothing boutiques.""There aren't four seasons; there are 52,"" said Siegel of the apparel space. When a product doesn't work, it goes on sale, and retailers have to hurry to push out inventory, creating what he calls a ""circular promotional death spiral.""Plus, prestige beauty brands have managed to keep pricing and distribution on a fairly short leash as they keep product availability exclusive to certain merchants.Still, there's nothing technically stopping Amazon from offering deals on Estee Lauder (EL) and other higher-end names.""My understanding is that luxury brands that are hesitant to partner with Amazon are concerned that this pricing consistency may be at risk,"" said NPD Group analyst Karen Grant.But even brands that don't have an official presence on Amazon are often sold via third-party sellers on the site. And counterfeit beauty products are a documented problem on Amazon, Alibaba (BABA), eBay (EBAY) and elsewhere.""(Brands) are deluding themselves into thinking Amazon doesn't have a large impact on their business because they're not officially distributed"" on the platform, said Scott Galloway, founder of research firm L2 and a professor of marketing at NYU Stern School of Business.Amazon's luxury beauty portal has been a ""disappointment"" for the company so far, he said, but it ""shows no signs of giving up"" — outspending Sephora and Macy's (M) on beauty-related search-engine keywords on Alphabet 's (GOOGL) Google.And as the online retailer continues its assertive march toward retail domination, it holds a bargaining chip or two. Brands that choose to distribute via the platform can enlist its cooperation in erasing third-party listings, according to Galloway, who said once Burberry and Calvin Klein gave Amazon the go-ahead to sell a ""small number"" of their fragrance products, ""unofficial SKUs (stock-keeping units)dropped dramatically.""""The implicit message from Amazon is: Work with us, or we will (mess) with you,"" he said.No Specifics On RelationshipsAmazon would not provide specifics on its relationships with brands, but a spokeswoman told IBD that Amazon's luxury beauty segment is one its ""fastest-growing categories,"" and its online storefront offerings have resulted in ""more brands want(ing) to join Amazon's Luxury Beauty store.""For now, however, specialty beauty retailers are holding their own, especially as they build out their e-commerce reach.Ulta's online sales soared 56.3% in Q3 as it crushed estimates and boosted guidance. Sephora's e-commerce sales are ""rapidly increasing in all regions,"" according to LVMH's latest earnings report. Cowen & Co. analyst Oliver Chen wrote that ""Sephora is best-in-class with regard to their mobile/online execution."" Plus, it has been gaining share ""in all its markets,"" with same-store revenue growth ""particularly strong,"" said LVMH.And never discount the appeal of being part of an exclusive backstage club.Ulta's loyalty-program membership has been accelerating, quarter over quarter, reaching 17 million active members. By comparison, Starbucks' (SBUX) much-lauded rewards program has over 20 million members globally.Amenities ProvidedThe things that Amazon does so well — offering a wide variety and free shipping — are amenities Ulta and Sephora already provide. Members of both Ultamate Rewards and Beauty Insider (Sephora's loyalty program) have the added benefit of redeeming points for products.Over the summer, Sephora shoppers had the chance to redeem ""Epic Rewards,"" ranging from a foursome of full-size Givenchy lipsticks for 1,000 points to a trip to Paris to visit Lancome for 10,000 points. (Notably, the rewards promotion faced scrutiny for selling out items too quickly, prompting a social media backlash.)Perks like that have so far been enough to steer beauty buyers away from the less lavish space of an online megamart. Cowen analysts wrote Thursday that beauty is one area with an ""un-Amazon-able"" retail proposition, and that offering a differentiated shopping experience and/or selling a product with an ""emotional component"" offers a viable path to compete against Amazon.""Loyalty programs are extremely compelling,"" said NPD's Grant. ""It's like candy.""""(They) incentivize you to shop and to shop with them, and they do an excellent job of it,"" she said. ""Price isn't everything. But they also offer a good price and good service and all of the rest.""

419,EBAY,"While Apple (AAPL) has garnered the support of the tech industry and civil liberties groups for its stance on smartphone security, the issue appears to have been too complex or serious for most comedians to want to touch.Among the late-night comedians, only Seth Meyers of NBC's ""Late Night"" took aim at the subject of smartphone encryption and explained why it's important that consumers know about it.Meyers devoted a nearly seven-minute segment, called ""A Closer Look,"" of his show to examine Apple’s refusal to unlock iPhones for law enforcement officials.Of course, Meyers couldn't resist making some jokes at Apple's expense.“Apple is fighting back against critics and says it has no ‘sympathy for terrorists’ despite refusing FBI orders to unlock private iPhone data. In fact, Apple hates terrorists so much, it’s releasing a new U2 album just for them,” Meyers said.Meyers' late-night rivals devoted much more time to mocking Facebook’s (FB) new reaction buttons.What follows are recent jokes from America's late-night comics on issues of science and technology. In addition to Facebook, other targets of jokes included Amazon.com (AMZN), eBay (EBAY), Fitbit (FIT), LinkedIn (LNKD), and the humanoid robot Atlas developed by Alphabet (GOOGL)-owned Boston Dynamics.Joining Meyers in on the fun were Jimmy Fallon, Conan O'Brien, Jimmy Kimmel, James Corden and Stephen Colbert.Conan: In addition to the “like” button, Facebook has now added buttons for “love,” “wow,” “haha,” “sad” and “angry.” In other words, Facebook copied the emotional journey of any Adele album.Kimmel: Facebook today rolled out a new thing called “Reactions.” Now instead of “liking” when a friend’s dog passes away, which is weird, you can be much more thoughtful and sensitive, posting a sad emoji with a giant tear squirting out of its face.Corden: Facebook has launched new alternatives that go beyond its trademark “like” button. Basically Facebook is doing what I tried and failed at with so many women -- moving beyond just ""like.""Fallon: Some crazy tech news. I saw that a company in Boston built a 5-foot-9 robot that can open doors, and can actually get back up if it’s punched. They didn’t MEAN to test whether it can get up after being punched, but well, it’s Boston. (BOSTON) “Not so tough, are ya, Terminator?”Meyers: Engineers at Boston Dynamics have unveiled a humanoid robot that can withstand getting pushed in the chest with a hockey stick without falling over. Which is definitely the most Boston way to test a robot.Conan: In France, a robot has been programmed to develop its own taste in art. The robot’s favorite paintings? Naked robots.Conan: Chase bank ATMs are getting a new feature that will allow customers to withdraw cash without using a card. The feature is called “a crowbar.”Conan: A recent study found that bottlenose dolphins sometimes murder other dolphins. However, police say it’s easy to find the culprit because dolphins love to squeal.Fallon: This is a little controversial. I saw that Oral Roberts University is now telling students that wearing Fitbits is mandatory, and logging less than 10,000 steps a day will affect their grades. So finally, some good news for students doing the walk of shame. “12,000 steps -- zero regrets!”Meyers: President Obama posted on LinkedIn today about his first job -- scooping ice cream. He’s the first president to post on LinkedIn -- other than, of course, Abraham LinkedIn.Meyers: A recent study suggests that it’s harder to concentrate in the winter. Said researchers, “For example, this study was supposed to be about traffic accidents.”Colbert: You guys like the website Amazon.com? It’s like eBay, but the things you buy don’t arrive smelling like cigarettes.Colbert: Amazon’s always been on the cutting edge. From drone delivery, to automated warehouses, to shipping six AA batteries in a box the size of a mini fridge.Colbert: Amazon is planning to open hundreds of actual physical bookstores. That’s exciting because you don’t see those much anymore and I think this could be the start of a whole trend of online retailers going real-world. For example, Tinder could open a singles bar, where everybody walks around stating their height.

420,EBAY,"A who’s who of Internet and technology companies on Thursday filed legal briefs in support of Apple (AAPL) in its fight to keep iPhone data private.The companies expressed concern that a federal court order forcing Apple to unlock an iPhone in a criminal case could have far-reaching negative implications for the privacy and security of consumer data.The law firm of Hogan Lovells represented 15 companies, including Amazon.com (AMZN), Cisco Systems (CSCO), Facebook (FB), Google and Microsoft (MSFT), in its brief backing Apple.Munger, Tolles & Olson represented 18 Internet companies, including eBay (EBAY), LinkedIn (LNKD), Twitter (TWTR) and privately held Automattic in its supporting brief.The Hogan Lovells filing argues that the federal government is misusing the All Writs Act to try to force Apple to write software to bypass its own security features. It notes that the companies filing the amicus brief often compete vigorously with Apple and each other, but “here speak with one voice because of the singular importance of this case to them and their customers.”The Munger, Tolles & Olson filing hammers home similar points.“This extraordinary and unprecedented effort to compel a private company to become the government’s investigative arm not only has no legal basis under the All Writs Act or any other law, but threatens the core principles of privacy, security, and transparency that underlie the fabric of the Internet,” the law firm wrote.On Feb. 16, U.S. Magistrate Sheri Pym ordered Apple to provide “reasonable technical assistance” to the FBI to help unlock an iPhone belonging to Syed Farook, one of the killers in the San Bernardino, Calif., terrorist attack on Dec. 2.Apple has protested the ruling, saying that it would create a “back door” to bypass its security protections and thus threaten the personal data of millions of iPhone users. Once available, the vulnerability could be exploited by cybercriminals, hackers and both foreign and domestic spies.Other parties filing briefs in support of Apple in the case include AT&T (T), Intel (INTC) and trade groups like the Consumer Technology Association and Business Software Alliance.Apple also has gained the backing of privacy advocacy groups including the American Civil Liberties Union, Electronic Frontier Foundation and Electronic Privacy Information Center.Apple has posted on its public relations website a list of parties filing amicus briefs in support of its case.But the FBI has garnered its own set of supporters filing amicus briefs in the case.Parties backing the FBI’s position include the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, the Association of Prosecuting Attorneys, the National Sheriffs’ Association, the California State Sheriffs’ Association, California Police Chiefs’ Association, California Peace Officers’ Association and San Bernardino District Attorney Michael Ramos, as well as the families of several victims of the Dec. 2 shootings.

421,EBAY,"Google announced a pilot app program Wednesday that aims to make it more seamless to use its Android Pay payments app.The new app, called Hands Free, will remove the need to use a smartphone at checkout, when shopping at merchants participating in the pilot -- which for now is limited to a southern portion of the San Francisco Bay Area.With Hands Free, shoppers at checkout tell cashiers that they want to ""pay with Google."" Checkout computers, equipped with the Android Pay app, then let cashiers call up a photo that the shopper already has uploaded to the app, to verify the shopper's identity, and then complete the transaction. In select stores, Google is testing the use of in-store cameras to automatically confirm a shopper's identity, based on the uploaded picture.Google is a subsidiary of Alphabet (GOOGL).The announcement signals Google's growing interest in the crowded payments sectors. It's a complex and competitive arena, with companies in the mix including Apple (AAPL) with Apple Pay; PayPal (PYPL) which recently split off from eBay (EBAY); and recent  IPO Square (SQ).If Hands Free indeed signals that Google plans to aggressively tackle online payments, it could spell trouble for PayPal, according to Alex Rampell, a general partner at the noted venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz.PayPal executives stick to their message that the San Jose, Calif.-based company is well-positioned, in part because unlike Google or Apple, it's platform agnostic. For example, PayPal processes many of the transactions conducted over Apple Pay.On Monday, San Francisco-based Square announced that it was adding the ability to store money on its Square Cash app, adding a feature already offered by PayPal and PayPal subsidiary Venmo. Venmo and Square Cash are peer-to-peer payments apps that are popular with millennials, which use them for things such as sharing the cost of a cab fare or meal.At least one analyst says Venmo stacks up well against rivals such as Google and Apple.Amazon.com (AMZN) is also in the payments business -- and that's the reason, according to industry watchers, that Amazon shoppers will not be able to pay with PayPal at any time in the near future. When PayPal spun off from eBay, executives said at the time that one advantage was the new business opportunities it couldn't get while attached to eBay.

That lifted the Nasdaq above 4609 -- just below the 4613 level at which it would break even for the month.Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq was tracking below Friday's levels in the stock market today.Inside the IBD 50, PayPal (PYPL) jumped 3.5% to 38.80 in heavy volume. It cleared an early entry at 38.62 but still has its all-time high to contend with at 42.55. The eBay (EBAY) spinoff started trading in July.Elsewhere, Signet Jewelers (SIG) was the top percentage gainer in the S&P 500, rising 11%, but it's still damaged goods at 27% off its 52-week high. Before the open, Wall Street liked the look of preliminary Q4 results, a new share repurchase program and a raised dividend.The market might still have a defensive tone, with gold miners, utility and food stocks still showing strength, but nondefensive areas of the market have been perking up. For example, as of Friday's close, three semiconductor-related industry groups ranked inside the top 25 of IBD's 197 industry group rankings.Among chip designers, Silicon Motion Technology (SIMO) picked up 2% to 33.88 . It's working on a cup-with-handle base with a 34.08 entry.First Solar (FSLR) rebounded after Friday's reversal. Shares rose 4% to 73.36. It's in the early stages of clearing a first-stage consolidation with a 72.22 buy point.In economic news, pending home sales unexpectedly fell in January while the Chicago PMI, a gauge of manufacturing activity, came in at 47.6, below the consensus estimate of 52.9.The bond market was unfazed by the soft economic data. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell 1 basis point to 1.75%.

The Wall Street Journal reported that its valuation was unavailable.Deliv has struck deals with Alphabet (GOOGL) subsidiary Google for its Express delivery service, among other clients including several startups.""Same-day is absolutely the new standard. That’s exactly what’s happening in the market. Look what Amazon is doing,"" Deliv CEO Daphne Carmeli told IBD.As part of the funding arrangement, UPS will gain a seat on the Deliv board -- an opportunity to gather intelligence about a business and market it doesn't operate in.Currently UPS only offers same-day delivery for high-margin sectors such as health care. Next-day delivery is available for evening pickups -- customers generally place orders online in the evening when returning from work.“I struggle to understand what it is that I need in less than a few hours,” Rimas Kapeskas, head of UPS’s Strategic Enterprise Fund, told the Wall Street Journal. UPS is specifically interested in Deliv's software that connects it directly with a retailer's website.UPS and Amazon have an uneasy relationship. At the moment Amazon.com is UPS's largest customer but as the e-tailer's delivery costs continue to soar, the company has begun to seek alternatives and is widely rumored to be building its own freight operation.Amazon.com offers free two-day shipping and other perks via it's loyalty program Amazon Prime. The e-tailer offers same-day delivery service via its Prime Now app.On the company's Q4 earnings call, executives characterized the speedy delivery options as very difficult and expensive but said customers love it.To support its various shipping options Amazon has entered the ocean freight shipping business, is rumored to be flying several flights a day from an airfield in Ohio to locations near its fulfillment centers, has bought a fleet of truck trailers, and is leasing a number of Boeing 767 cargo aircraft.But, it's still unclear who is going to crack the code on same-day delivery. It's a complex and expensive business with low margins. Others, such as San Jose-based eBay (EBAY) tried to launch in the U.S. but ultimately ended the pilot program. CEO Devin Wenig said at the time the company had ""mixed results"" for the delivery service.

435,EBAY,"As the official start to the holiday shopping season arrives, Americans are using their mobile devices more than ever to capitalize on Thanksgiving and Black Friday deals online.On Thursday and early Friday, mobile traffic accounted for nearly 60% of all online shopping traffic, and 40% of all online sales, said Justin Norwood, product strategist for IBM (IBM) Watson Trend, which analyzes online shopping data.Shopping via Apple (AAPL) iPhone and other smartphones was about triple tablet shopping, IBM says.""Both on the hits side and on the sales size, the smartphone is outpacing tablets, and smartphone shoppers dominate,"" Norwood told IBD. ""It seems like this is the breakout year for mobile optimization, and retailers have invested a considerable amount in their mobile sites.""It takes a considerable investment (to optimize for mobile sales), but prior to doing so the shopper experience on a phone (was) very difficult.""The strong sales are a generally good sign for e-commerce stocks like Amazon.com (AMZN) and PayPal (PYPL). According to ChannelAdvisor, which tracks third-party selling on e-com sites, third-party Amazon.com sales were up 20% year over year for the start of the season, but eBay (EBAY) sales were down 10%.Shares of Amazon and PayPal, however, both fell a fraction in Friday's shortened session, while eBay stock rose a fraction.Adobe Systems' (ADBE) Adobe Digital Index, which measures 80% of all online transactions from the top 100 U.S. retailers, found that 37% of online sales for the early part of Black Friday came via mobile, mostly smartphones.Hal Lawton, senior vice president of eBay North America, told IBD that mobile sales were strong on that site. ""We sold a limited edition Mercedes on an Android phone, a Lamborghini on an iPhone, and a Ferrari (RACE) Testarossa on an iPhone,"" he said.EBay says mobile growth is the trend. ""For us, mobile is not a new story,"" Lawton said. ""For Q3, we saw 43% of traffic on mobile. And we're seeing shoppers start on one platform, like a phone, and then finish shopping on another, like an iPad.""But Adobe said online sales were lagging its estimate. Sales between midnight and 11 a.m. ET Friday rose 15% from the year-earlier period to $822 million, it said, but Adobe had expected 19% growth. Adobe is anticipating $2.6 billion in online sales for Black Friday.On Thanksgiving, email promotions accounted for 14% of online sales, says Adobe, rising 25% from last Thanksgiving.Adobe's report also found that eBay surpassed Amazon.com in social media buzz.""We're very pleased by the results we saw on Thanksgiving, and we're pleased with the early momentum today,"" Lawton said.

Wall Street had forecast $2.16 billion in sales and 48 cents for EPS.Shares dived nearly 12% late following a 0.9% drop in regular trading Wednesday.""We delivered solid fourth quarter results and continued to make progress against our key priorities,"" said eBay CEO Devin Wenig, in the earnings announcement. ""The quarter also marked the end of an extraordinary year during which we completed the spin-off of PayPal. We continue to grow our business and customer base while executing our plan to reposition eBay for long-term success.""Gross merchandise volume of $20.7 billion in the quarter resulted in $1.9 billion in revenue, the company said, as its active buy base grew by 8 million in 2015 to 162 million total active buyers, up 5% from a year earlier.PayPal shares rose 5% late after the electronics payments spin-off reported better-than-expected earnings late Wednesday.The eBay stock sell-off didn't spread to larger, faster-growing e-commerce peer Amazon.com (AMZN).

That's way up from IBM's tally of an 8.5% sales gain for full-day Cyber Monday last year.Mobile users accounted for 46% of all online traffic, up 16% over 2014, IBM said.""Mobile continues to be the story,"" Anuj Nayar, senior director of global initiatives at online transaction company PayPal (PYPL), told IBD.Adobe Systems' (ADBE) Adobe Digital Index, which says that it measures 80% of transactions for the top 100 U.S. retailers, projected U.S. Cyber Monday sales to hit $3 billion and be the largest online sales day of the year.Adobe said that mobile traffic accounted for 53% of shopping visits and 32% of sales.ITG analyst Steve Weinstein told IBD he sees three trends:• Heavy shopping has started earlier in the season.• Mobile buying has changed shopping behaviors.• And retailers, especially Amazon.com (AMZN), that have heavily invested in fulfillment infrastructure, will do well and lengthen their selling season.From Thanksgiving Day through Sunday, U.S. shoppers spent $8.03 billion online, up 17%, says Adobe. Baird analyst Colin Sebastian wrote in a research note that initial shopping data appears ""positive"" for Amazon, Google owner Alphabet (GOOGL), ChannelAdvisor (ECOM) and PayPal.""We're all pretty excited here,"" Scot Wingo, executive chairman of ChannelAdvisor, told IBD. ChannelAdvisor tracks third-party sales on e-commerce sites such as Amazon and eBay (EBAY).Big-screen and ultrahigh-def (4K) TV sets are among this year's top sellers, says IBM's Justin Norwood.""In particular, Samsung seems to have hit a chord across the 4K picture and sound price point, and has taken a leadership position,"" Norwood told IBD.The Apple (AAPL) Watch is another big seller, ""but that trend goes back three months now, from our data,"" Norwood said.Hoverboards — single-axle, self-balancing scooters — also are hot. EBay says that it sold two hoverboards a minute on Thanksgiving. ""If there were a breakout item, that's it,"" Hal Lawton, senior vice president of eBay North America, told IBD.ChannelAdvisor reported that as of 3 p.m. EST, Cyber Monday sales were up 16.8% over the year-earlier period, but a small percentage from last year's growth.EBay ""is offering very unusual promotions,"" said Wingo. ""They seem to be saying that we're going to opt-out of competing with the big guys on the latest GoPro (GPRO) camera, for example.""ChannelAdvisor said third-party sales were up 22% at Amazon but less than 2% at eBay, though it represents just a small percentage of eBay sellers.Lawton, in a statement, said eBay is making ""an aggressive push"" for daily deals on Apple products.No. 4 U.S. retailer Target (TGT) suffered a website outage at 10 a.m. EST Monday on heavy traffic. The company ran an aggressive promotion, offering 15% off any item on its website. Target had to get a lot of product makers onboard for such an offer, Wingo said, ""and that required a lot of planning in advance.""PayPal, too, suffered a morning outage that Nayar described as brief, declining to go into detail.

446,EBAY," No. 1 online retailer Amazon.com (AMZN) drew more than a third of Americans' Black Friday and Cyber Monday e-commerce spending by one estimate, while a Wednesday tally called Cyber Monday the heaviest U.S. online spending day in history.Amazon, however, actually appears to have lost a little Cyber Monday market share.Official numbers aren't in from Amazon yet on holiday sales, but by analytics firm Slice Intelligence's tally, Amazon accounted for 35.7% of e-commerce spending on Black Friday, Nov. 27, followed by Best Buy (BBY) with 8.2%, Macy's (M) with 3.4%, and Wal-Mart (WMT) at 3.3%.Amazon's Black Friday share was way up from 31.5% last year in the tally, and Slice estimated that Amazon Black Friday sales rose 23.2% from a year ago.Slice spokeswoman Jaimee Minney told IBD that Cyber Monday ""was bigger than Black Friday and bigger than Cyber Monday last year.""The Black Friday estimate comes primarily from an analysis of about 876,000 email receipts provided by Slice's panel of 3 million shoppers.Amazon garnered a 36.1% share of U.S. e-commerce sales on Cyber Monday by Slice's estimate, down 2.7 percentage points from a year earlier.Also by its estimate, ""the retailer's sales were down 1.3% vs. the same day last year,"" Minney said in an email.Wal-Mart was the only store in the top five to gain share on Cyber Monday by that tally — up half a percentage point, to 3.8%.Cyber Monday SoarsWednesday, online tracker comScore said Cyber Monday reached $3.12 billion in online spending, up 21% from last year's Cyber Monday.ComScore's mobile figures aren't final, but it said desktop online spending set a record, at $2.28 billion.ComScore said that for the first 30 days of the holiday season, $27.9 billion has been spent online by desktops, up 6% from a year ago.""The weekend after Thanksgiving also reached a major milestone as it saw its first ever billion-dollar online shopping day on Sunday,"" it said in a report Wednesday, ""while Saturday sales reached the $1 billion mark for a second year in a row.""Overall, Cyber Monday online sales set a record with $3.07 billion in spending across the U.S., up 16% from last year, according to Adobe Systems' (ADBE) Adobe Index, as Amazon leveraged its e-commerce dominance. But Thanksgiving weekend sales looked weak at brick-and-mortar retailers.Apple (AAPL) iPad and iPhone doorbusters were hits for Target (TGT) and others, while Wal-Mart announced booming mobile sales.Retail analytics provider ShopperTrak, however, estimates that U.S. physical stores took in 10.4% less than a year earlier over Thanksgiving, Black Friday and the weekend — an estimated $20.4 billion that does not include Cyber Monday.Amazon's Black Friday showing wouldn't be out of line with the IBD Leaderboard company's heft in online shopping — the company ""makes up about 69% of total U.S. retail traffic,"" Canaccord Genuity analyst Michael Graham said in a research report this week. Minney said Amazon's Black Friday crowd ""doesn't surprise us.""Amazon said that it had a record Thanksgiving weekend for selling Amazon devices, triple last year's result. Its top-selling products across all those available on Amazon.com on Black Friday were Amazon devices, the company said — No. 1 was Fire (its tablet line), and No. 2 was the Fire TV stick for streaming video online.Where People Shop OnlineIn October, the latest month tallied, Amazon drew over 160 million online visitors, up 19% from a year ago according to comScore (SCOR) and Canaccord estimates.

RBC Capital's figures, though, include spending on retail stores as well, since Apple does not separate the two areas.Apple, Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google, Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon.com (AMZN) account for 75% of spending in RBC's cloud capital spending survey. Facebook (FB), eBay (EBAY) and China's Alibaba, Baidu (BIDU) and Tencent account for an additional 15% of the spending, says RBC analyst Amit Daryanani in the report.He says cloud capital spending by six Chinese companies tracked in the survey rose 71% in the September quarter to $1.1. billion. Alibaba and other Chinese e-commerce firms reported record numbers for their Singles Day shopping event on 11/11.Based on consensus estimates, cloud capital spending overall in 2015 will rise just 6.7% to $43.8 billion, says Daryanani, slowing from 2014's 29% growth rate.

476,EBAY,"When it comes to holiday wish lists, gift cards remain a top choice among consumers this season. That's music to the ears of prepaid card and payments company Blackhawk Network (HAWK).""Blackhawk is one of the big providers of gift cards and related services,"" Wedbush Securities analyst Gil Luria told Investor's Business Daily. ""It helps content providers like retailers that want to sell outside their premises on grocery store shelves.""Blackhawk uses proprietary technology to offer a broad range of prepaid gift, telecom and debit cards, in physical and electronic forms, as well as related prepaid products and payment services. The company supports the management and distribution of these products in a number of different retail, digital and incentive channels.It sells to consumers through its retail distribution network, whether in stores or on websites. Blackhawk also provides services, software and prepaid products to business clients for loyalty, incentive and reward programs, using its own sales force, as well as third-party resellers.23 CountriesBlackhawk's retail distribution partners showcase gift cards on displays that Blackhawk manages. Outside the U.S., Blackhawk distributes to its non-U.S. partners in 23 countries via grocery stores and other retail channels.The company seems to be in the right place at the right time. Gift cards remained the most requested holiday gift by consumers in a November National Retail Federation survey. And a recent poll by Deloitte found redeemable cards are the No. 2 gift that shoppers plan to buy this holiday.Consumers showed just how popular gift cards are over the Thanksgiving/Black Friday weekend. Stored Value Solutions reports sales of gift cards in the U.S. were up 4% year over year for the four days of the Thanksgiving holiday weekend, double 2014's year-over-year gain of 2%.Blackhawk distributes merchant-branded prepaid, or ""closed-loop,"" cards for companies such as Amazon (AMZN), Apple's (AAPL) iTunes, Macy's (M), Starbucks (SBUX)and Best Buy (BBY), in addition to other prepaid products like telecom cards, open-loop gift cards that can be redeemed anywhere, and reloadable prepaid debit cards.The company isn't content with that, however. Blackhawk has bulked up with a steady flow of acquisitions, new businesses and expanded distribution. That's helped it gain traction in its traditional space and in the ""incentive"" gift card arena, where customers are rewarded for loyalty.New DivisionMany of the buyouts are part of a new division, Blackhawk Engagement Solutions, that was formed this year.""Our strategy since inception has been to connect great brands to consumers through a productive global network,"" Teri Llach, Blackhawk's chief marketing officer, told IBD. ""Motivating employees via a prepaid card or gift card is a logical expansion going from a retail presence, where we're connecting brands to consumers, to corporate incentives, where we're connecting employers to employees.""The incentives and rewards business has proven to be the fastest-growing segment for Blackhawk and is driving its rapid expansion, says Wedbush's Luria.""Their biggest business, which is closed-loop gift cards, has slowed down to maybe single-digit growth,"" Luria said. ""To generate growth, they've been making acquisitions of these corporate incentives and rewards companies.""Showing In NumbersIt's showing up in the numbers. In the third quarter, Blackhawk's adjusted earnings grew 52% to 35 cents a share. Adjusted revenue jumped 54% to $193.4 million.Its incentives and rewards segment's adjusted operating revenues soared 392% from a year earlier, primarily due to the acquisition of Parago and the purchase of Achievers, Chief Executive Bill Tauscher said in a recent press release. Meanwhile, its U.S. retail segment grew adjusted operating revenue 21% in the third quarter. The international retail segment posted adjusted operating revenue growth of 27%.Luria says the corporate incentives and rewards business is more of a year-round concern, while the company's core gift card segment is seasonal, with all of its business generated in the fourth quarter around the holidays. Luria expects the company to continue to make acquisitions since its core business is slowing down.Latest PurchaseBlackhawk's latest buy came last month with the purchase of Didix Gifting & Promotions.Based in the Netherlands, Didix issues and markets leisure-themed gifts and promotions using a prepaid card that can be redeemed for services at multiple leisure outlets, including regional retailers, restaurants, cinemas and spas. It develops gifting and promotional products and brands across the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Germany and Belgium.Blackhawk's Llach says all of the company's acquisitions have been a ""significant driver of Blackhawk's earnings growth.""""We are in 23 countries, and we are looking at smart ways to expand where we see a market (opportunity),"" Llach said.Safeway SpinoffBlackhawk was spun off from privately held grocery giant Safeway in 2014. Safeway and other grocers such as Kroger (KR) are distribution partners.Other partners include Home Depot (HD), Lowe's (LOW) and Staples (SPLS) as well as online giants Amazon and eBay (EBAY).Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Blackhawk's full-year 2015 earnings to rise 31% to $2.31 a share. They see a 14% gain in 2016 and an 11% increase in 2017.""As long as they continue to make acquisitions, they will grow (at a rapid) rate,"" said Luria. ""At some point it will be harder to do. If they run out of balance-sheet ability (because of too much debt), it will be harder for them to borrow more money to make acquisitions.""Blackhawk is part of IBD's Finance-Credit Card/Payment Processors industry group. It leads the group with a 99 IBD Composite Rating out of a possible 99.

He pointed to research firm comScore's recent website traffic analysis showing eBay isn't adding unique visitors as fast as others in the sector.Also, a recent survey found that Amazon.com's (AMZN) same-store sales in September far outpaced eBay's.EBay also rejiggered the way one of its subsidiaries, online ticket broker StubHub, charges processing fees.Last quarter, the company committed an additional $1 billion to stock buybacks, bringing its total commitment to $3 billion.PayPal is slated to report its Q3 earnings Oct. 28 after the close.

582,EBAY,"Holiday sales growth is expected to decelerate from the same season last year amid slower jobs growth and concerns of a government shutdown, said the National Retail Federation (NRF).
"
583,EBAY,"Retailers will have to keep prices low and the online offers flowing. As shoppers guard their wallets, could this situation mean further gains for off-price stores like Nordstrom (JWN) Rack and TJX's (TJX) T.J. Maxx and Marshalls?
"
584,EBAY,"American consumers are ""somewhat torn between their desire and their ability to spend,"" said NRF CEO Matthew Shay in a release. With the economy on their minds, he expects families to spend ""prudently and deliberately.""
"
585,EBAY,"The group expects November and December sales to grow 3.7% to $630.5 billion, a slowdown from last year's 4.1% growth, though higher than the 10-year average of 2.5%.
"
586,EBAY,"""Price, value and even timing will all play a role in how, when, where and why people shop over the holiday season,"" said Shay. ""Retailers will be competitive not only on price but on digital initiatives, store hours, product offerings and much more.""

"
589,EBAY,"Brick-and-mortar retailers have long been vying with the likes of Amazon (AMZN) and other retailers in the digital shopping space. Target (TGT) expanded its price-match policy to Target.com merchandise, starting last week, and will now price-match Amazon, Costco (COST) and 27 other retailers online. The big-box retailer is hiring 70,000 seasonal workers.
"
590,EBAY,"The NRF predicts the hiring of a total of 700,000-750,000 seasonal workers this holiday season, ""in line with last year's 714,000 new holiday positions.""
"
591,EBAY,"The Off-Price Is Right
"
592,EBAY,"Separately, off-price retailers should continue to grab market share from the full-price sector, ""given the secular preference of consumers,"" said Sourcing Journal founder Edward Hertzman, according to a Cowen & Co. report from Wednesday.
"
593,EBAY,"Cowen's report says, ""Rather than gain share from one another, Hertzman sees continued growth at the various segments of off-price: a) high-end off-price stores incl. Saks OFF 5th and (Nordstrom) Rack, b) larger-scale incumbents where brands are key like (TJX's) T. J. Maxx (and) Marshall's, and c) price-conscious budget off-price stores incl. Ross (ROST) and Burlington (BURL) Coat Factory.""
"
594,EBAY,"While Nordstrom is not exclusively an off-pricer, Rack has proven to be complementary to the main business, leading 1 million Rack shoppers back to the full-line or online Nordstrom store. Rack brought in 4 million new shoppers in 2014.
"
595,EBAY,"But Macy's (M) new off-price concept, Macy's Backstage, is likely to cannibalize sales at the mainline stores, believes Hertzman, since there is a smaller price difference between Macy's full-price and off-price offerings.
"
596,EBAY,"Cowen analysts see ""particularly strong growth opportunity for TJX"" and are positive on Nordstrom's off-price offshoot.
"
597,EBAY,"For the holidays, Hertzman expects ""yet another promotional holiday season"" and sees shoppers gravitating toward electronics.

The big-box retailer is hiring 70,000 seasonal workers.The NRF predicts the hiring of a total of 700,000-750,000 seasonal workers this holiday season, ""in line with last year's 714,000 new holiday positions.""The Off-Price Is RightSeparately, off-price retailers should continue to grab market share from the full-price sector, ""given the secular preference of consumers,"" said Sourcing Journal founder Edward Hertzman, according to a Cowen & Co. report from Wednesday.Cowen's report says, ""Rather than gain share from one another, Hertzman sees continued growth at the various segments of off-price: a) high-end off-price stores incl. Saks OFF 5th and (Nordstrom) Rack, b) larger-scale incumbents where brands are key like (TJX's) T. J. Maxx (and) Marshall's, and c) price-conscious budget off-price stores incl. Ross (ROST) and Burlington (BURL) Coat Factory.""While Nordstrom is not exclusively an off-pricer, Rack has proven to be complementary to the main business, leading 1 million Rack shoppers back to the full-line or online Nordstrom store. Rack brought in 4 million new shoppers in 2014.But Macy's (M) new off-price concept, Macy's Backstage, is likely to cannibalize sales at the mainline stores, believes Hertzman, since there is a smaller price difference between Macy's full-price and off-price offerings.Cowen analysts see ""particularly strong growth opportunity for TJX"" and are positive on Nordstrom's off-price offshoot.For the holidays, Hertzman expects ""yet another promotional holiday season"" and sees shoppers gravitating toward electronics.Nordstrom shares closed up 1.5% in the stock market today. TJX shares rose 0.5%. Ross stock rose 1.8% and Macy's shares finished up 0.7%.Millennials' Online SpendingAccording to a report out Thursday from eBay (EBAY) spinoff PayPal (PYPL), millennials — a prized consumer group — are likeliest to want to use online credit to buy clothing and accessories, electronics and mobile devices through the end of 2015.The 20- and early 30-somethings make up PayPal Credit's fastest growing segment, it said.Follow Elaine Low on Twitter @IBD_ELow.RELATED:Retailers See New Things In Store For Online ShoppersAfter Amazon Prime Day, Retail Sales Take Apple PauseNordstrom, Macy's Look To TJ Maxx To Stay In Vogue

In the first quarter of 2015, U.S. Amazon Prime memberships rose 46% year over year. Memberships grew 57% in Q2 and 62% in Q3.""U.S. Amazon Prime membership has grown significantly since we first started measuring it in 2013,"" Josh Lowitz, CIRP partner and co-founder, said in a statement. ""It has almost tripled in two years, with 46% of all Amazon customers in the quarter using some form of Prime membership.""Amazon Prime members are better customers for the e-commerce giant. U.S. Prime members spend on average about $1,200 a year at Amazon.com, compared with $600 a year for nonmembers.About 25% of the new members in Q3 joined to take advantage of the Amazon Prime Day sales on July 15, Mike Levin, CIRP partner and co-founder, said in a press release.Amazon Prime costs $99 a year and includes free two-day shipping on millions of items, an ad-free streaming music service and a streaming video service that rivals that of Netflix (NFLX).If Amazon could get all of its Prime members to watch its Internet video service, it would have more users than Netflix. Netflix ended the September quarter with 42.1 million paid streaming subscribers in the U.S.Amazon has been bulking up its original and licensed content to take on Netflix.

"
616,EBAY,"Tech companies have long been the innovation trendsetters, turning in strong earnings reports that most often put the industry at or near the top of the best-performing groups in the S&P 500. At least, that's how it had been. But the 2.4% average EPS growth outlook for Q3 would mark the sector's worst performance since Q2 2013, according to data collected by Thomson Reuters.

It's one of the highest rated stocks in the finance-credit card group, with a 94 Composite Rating.Global Payments shares touched a record high of 120.29 in early trading in the stock market today before finishing the session down 1.3% to 116.90. The company is expected to deliver another robust earnings gain when it reports fiscal Q1 results before Wednesday's open.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters project EPS of $1.43, up 17% from the prior year. That would mark the ninth straight quarter of double-digit earnings growth.In a Monday morning note, RBC Capital Markets analyst Daniel Perlin said Global Payments is ""in the middle of a multiyear mix shift to higher-margin, faster-growing revenues in the international market as well as toward direct channels,"" helped by acquisitions and new partnerships.""We believe continued solid fundamental performance, as well as new partnerships (especially in Asia and Europe), pricing opportunities and growth in the integrated and direct channels could act as catalysts for the shares to gain higher multiples, thus propelling the shares higher,"" Perlin said.On Oct. 1, new rules mandated that merchants have credit card readers that can take cards with EMV chip technology.

644,EBAY,"August was a slow month for Web traffic, but some retailers bucked the trend with robust growth, including Amazon (AMZN) and Restoration Hardware (RH).With Labor Day falling later this year, Americans had longer to loll away summer and vacation days in August, which may explain why e-commerce traffic weakened.Web traffic growth in August vs. a year ago decelerated for the majority of e-commerce, broadline (i.e., department stores) and hardline (i.e., electronics) retailers, according to a report from Wells Fargo, which looked at multiplatform data from comScore for companies under its coverage. The data included unique Web traffic over desktops, smartphones and tablets combined.Some retailers bucked the overall trend with relatively strong gains, including two home furnishing companies — Restoration Hardware and Wayfair (W). Others were e-commerce king Amazon, deal site Groupon (GRPN) and Etsy (ETSY), the online marketplace for crafts and handmade goods.Web traffic at Restoration Hardware, which unlike most retailers has been opening more and larger brick-and-mortar stores, surged more than 66% in August vs. a year earlier. E-commerce-focused Wayfair saw Web traffic jump 42.2%, though it fell off at one of its brands, Joss & Main.Amazon's Web traffic rose 27%, the ninth straight month of a strong double-digit gain. Groupon's jumped 30.6%, and Etsy's 30.6%.Though Wal-Mart's (WMT) Web traffic rose 36.7% from a year ago, it was the slowest pace since March.Notable laggards during August were Five Below (FIVE) (down 21.4%), eBay (EBAY) (down 11.2%) and Shutterfly (SFLY) (down 9%).Shares of Amazon closed up 1% on the stock market today.

645,EBAY,"One of the biggest announcements from Apple's debut of its new line of iPhones on Sept. 9 was that Facebook's messaging service will be available on the Apple Watch.Facebook (FB) has come a long way from its start as a social network for college students. It's now one of the most recognizable brands in the world and a major communications network that connects people and companies around the globe.If it seems like everyone is on Facebook, it's because just about everyone knows someone on it — from parents and teenagers to brands and media outlets.In the last quarter, Facebook engaged 1.19 billion monthly active users and 728 million daily users. That's a long way from the few private colleges Facebook launched with in 2004.Eyeing ChinaThe company still has room to grow, says Victor Anthony, a senior analyst at Axiom Capital. China has blocked Facebook, but Anthony still sees opportunity there for the social networking site. Homegrown social media sites like Sina's (SINA) Weibo and others are already doing well in China.Anthony also sees opportunities in Africa, Latin America and India, where Google (GOOGL) and other Internet companies are making inroads.To get more users, the companies need to get more of the 7 billion people on Earth online.Google launched Project Loon, a network of high-altitude balloons, to connect people in remote areas who don't have Internet access.Facebook is working on drones, satellites and lasers to deliver the Internet to people without access.""Facebook was limited to college students; its lure was that it was somewhat limited to a certain group of people,"" Anthony said. ""When it opened up, everyone rushed in to see what the privileged few had.""Meanwhile, Facebook continues to grow by expanding its offerings and letting users share information seamlessly.Anthony said that Facebook's purchase of photo sharing site Instagram was one of its most important buys, but many analysts thought the $1 billion price tag on Instagram was outrageous for the tiny company in 2012.Now Instagram has 300 million monthly active users, with 70% of them outside the U.S.WhatsApp, the international messaging app, is another successful purchase. Last month, WhatsApp hit 900 million monthly active users after hitting 800 million in April. Facebook bought it in February 2014 for $22 billion.Facebook has been better at picking winners than others.""YouTube was a winner for Google, but Google also had a lot more failures than winners,"" Anthony said. ""But Facebook has been more disciplined, and has the Midas touch to pick out acquisitions that work for them.""Facebook still has purchases that need to prove themselves.Last July, it paid $2 billion for the virtual reality pioneer Oculus VR. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that the deal was part of Facebook's mission to ""make the world more open and connected.""Oculus still hasn't released a virtual reality headset product for consumers, even though software developers have created games and other applications for the device.Zuckerberg still hasn't said when a product will debut from Oculus VR, but Anthony said the company has the potential to be another home run for the social network.""If you go back 10 years, most of how people communicated and shared was text,"" Zuckerberg said in the Q2 conference call in July. ""We are going through a period where now it's mostly visual and photos. We are entering into a period where that's going to increasingly be primarily video, and we're seeing huge growth there. But that's not the end of the line.""Facebook's internally designed products have been gaining users. ComScore said Facebook's Messenger app dethroned YouTube as the second most-downloaded mobile app in the U.S. after Facebook separated its main app and messaging service. The app reached 700 million monthly average users in June.In late August, Facebook debuted its M personal assistant service in San Francisco to rival Apple's (AAPL) Siri and Google Now. The service can help users book restaurant reservations or buy gifts for friends online.Facebook is taking on eBay (EBAY) and Craigslist by expanding its groups feature that lets users and companies buy and sell items outside their friend group. In March, Facebook said users can track online orders via the Messenger app. But selling items online hasn't always been a success for Facebook. In 2007, it launched Marketplace, but the service wasn't popular because users couldn't search for a location or reach people outside their network.Facebook has an IBD EPS rating of 94 and a near-best IBD Composite Rating of 98 out of 99. It's part of IBD's Internet-Content industry group along with Google, Yahoo (YHOO), professional networking site LinkedIn (LNKD), microblogging site Twitter (TWTR) and review site Yelp (YELP).Facebook shares currently trade near 94.Ad PioneerA big issue before Facebook's initial public offering in 2012 was how to create a revenue stream, since Zuckerberg said using the site would always be free.Initially users were skeptical about ads, but Facebook has been pioneering native ads that look like part of the content and are less intrusive. The site recently launched a news feed ad that becomes a full page once clicked and can include videos and interactive photos and other elements.On Sept. 9, Instagram said it expanded its ads to Italy, Spain, India and 27 other countries.Facebook has also successfully monetized mobile ads as more users scroll through their news feed on their smartphones.""Management has really stepped up to the plate being able to capture the mobile shift because that had been a headwind for them,"" Anthony said.Facebook still faces risks in the quickly evolving Internet space. Just like Facebook ousted MySpace as the social network of choice, a new competitor could replace Facebook as teens shift away from a network where their parents, grandparents and teachers roam.Snapchat, a photo messaging service, is gaining popularity with teens and young adults, with nearly 200 million users, according to industry reports. In 2013 Facebook tried to buy Snapchat for $3 billion, but the offer was rejected.If Facebook starts losing the highly coveted 18- to 34-year-old demographic for advertisers, then advertisers could shift their ads off Facebook and to a network with better returns.

661,EBAY,"Regulation: Hillary Clinton claimed that California's paid family leave mandate hasn't hurt business and job growth, and ought to be expanded nationwide. But a recent study shows that she's living in a statist dream world.Clinton made the ill-informed remark at Tuesday's Democratic presidential debate during an exchange with CNN's Dana Bash:BASH: Secretary Clinton, you now support mandated paid family leave. Carly Fiorina argues if the government requires paid leave, it will force small businesses to ""hire fewer people and create fewer jobs."" What do you say, not only to Fiorina, but also a small-business owner out there who says, you know, I like this idea, but I just can't afford it?CLINTON: Well, I'm surprised she says that because California has had a paid leave program for a number of years. And it has not had the ill effects that the Republicans are always saying it will have. This is typical Republican scare tactics. We can design a system (like that at the federal level).Clinton might want to do more homework.She can start by reading a report by the San Francisco-based Pacific Research Institute, which found that — thanks in large part to its paid family leave mandate — California has the nation's worst regulatory climate for small business and among its slowest payroll growth.And such costly workplace mandates are why so many California businesses keep moving to Texas and other business-friendly states, taking thousands of jobs with them.The Golden State was the first to mandate paid family leave, launching a program in 2004 that lets workers take up to six paid weeks a year to care for a newborn child or other family members. California's family leave regulation is now the most generous — and burdensome — in the nation.""California's regulatory policy makes it more difficult and more costly for current and potential entrepreneurs,"" said study author Wayne Winegarden, a senior fellow at PRI and a partner in the consulting firm Capitol Economic Advisors. ""These higher costs reduce the amount of business growth.""And payroll employment growth. The 123-page report shows California's payrolls continue to trail other states. State job growth significantly lagged even the subpar national average between 2002 and 2011.Clinton might also want to talk to CEOs recently joining the corporate exodus from California.By relocating its corporate headquarters and distribution facilities — and 350 workers — to the Dallas area, coffee maker Farmer Bros. expects to save $15 million a year. Farmer follows Toyota, which moved its U.S. sales and marketing headquarters to Texas, as well as Raytheon Space and Airborne Systems, eBay, Occidental Petroleum and RifleGear. Nissan recently bailed to Tennessee — which like Texas doesn't require employers to pay for family leave.Clinton vows to fight for passage of her New York pal Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand's long-languishing bill, ""The Family and Medical Insurance Leave Act,"" which would create a federal program for employees to continue to receive a paycheck while they take time off work for a long-term illness or to care for a relative.""I see my good friend, Sen. Gillibrand, in the front row. She's been a champion of this,"" Clinton gushed at the debate. ""We need to get a consensus through this campaign, which is why I'm talking about it everywhere I go. And we need to join the rest of the advanced world in having it.""Yes, let's join the democratic socialist countries of the European Union and have all their litany of anti-growth regulations — along with their institutional unemployment.

690,EBAY,"On June 9, 2015, MSCI announced that it was not ready to include Chinese A-shares in their global indexes. In that announcement the company voiced a series of concerns that need to be addressed before inclusion and a roadmap of how it plans to include these shares. Part of that roadmap toward full adoption includes opening up MSCI's indexes to Chinese companies that are listed in overseas markets. MSCI will potentially include 17 overseas listed stocks between November 2015 and May 2016, which they estimate to represent 12.9% of the eligible Chinese market cap.1WisdomTree has also been monitoring the continued openness of the Chinese A-share market to foreign investors for potential inclusion in the WisdomTree China ex-State-Owned Enterprises Index (CHXSOE). Unlike MSCI, WisdomTree has already allowed overseas Chinese equities for inclusion in CHXSOE as well as the WisdomTree Emerging Markets Consumer Growth Index (WTEMCG).To WisdomTree, the traditional Hong Kong-listed Chinese market is saturated with the large state-owned Chinese companies, particularly in the Financials, Energy and Telecom sectors. This is noticeable when we examine the current MSCI China Index (MXCN), which has over 60% weight in those three sectors and approximately 70% weight in companies we would consider state owned.2 Although the Chinese state-owned Financials are some of the lowest-priced stocks globally, there is a demand for exposure to the Chinese private sector, which is why WisdomTree decided to include these stocks in select Indexes focused on the emerging market consumer.Over the past few years, we have witnessed Chinese companies decide to list their shares on the U.S. market, which we believe reflects an effort to more easily access global capital. One noticeable similarity between most of the companies is that they tend to be a part of the Information Technology or Consumer Discretionary sector and their business is focused on the emerging Chinese consumer. Below, we list the 20 largest Chinese companies that are listed on a U.S. stock exchange and their respective weights in CHXSOE and MXCN.Twenty Largest Chinese Companies Listed in U.S.

It also raised full-year guidance.

Shares soared 8% the day after the earnings report, as investors turned optimistic on third-quarter sales and traffic trends . Chipotle remains near new highs.Reynolds American (RAI) also has done well since its quarterly report.

836,EBAY,"Google (GOOGL) is crushing the competition when it comes to Internet search on smartphones, a new survey shows. A survey of over 1,000 U.S. smartphone owners June 15-19 found that the ""vast majority"" find online information with their handset using Google search, survey sponsor Mizuho Securities said in a research report Thursday.
"
837,EBAY,"""Although we believe smartphone owners are increasingly going to mobile apps for their specific needs (e.g., Google Maps for directions, Yelp (YELP) for restaurant reviews, etc.), it appears that the vast majority of users are still completing traditional search queries,"" Mizuho analyst Neil Doshi wrote. ""Google stands out as the clear winner in this scenario, given the Google search app, Apple's (AAPL) Safari browser search and Google's Chrome browser all utilize the Google search engine.""
"
838,EBAY,"Apple might stop using Google as the default search engine for Safari when their current deal is up later this year, he said. But Google could still get search traffic on Apple iPhones from individual apps and consumers manually using Google in browser searches.
"
839,EBAY,"While the loss of the Safari contract would be bad for Google's search volume, it is potentially accretive for Google, since it would no longer have to pay Apple traffic acquisition costs, Doshi said.

1044,EBAY,"Online payment processor PayPal is much likelier to partner with China's Alibaba Group than Amazon.com (AMZN) after its spinoff from eBay, speculates Morgan Stanley, which raised its price target on eBay.Brian Nowak, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, raised his price target on eBay (EBAY) to 68 from 52 in a research report Thursday, on views an alliance with Alibaba (BABA) could materialize. He valued PayPal, which has expanded into mobile payments, at 38 per share. The spinoff is expected to take place in Q3.EBay stock was up a fraction in early-afternoon trading in the stock market today, near 62.Nowak says one concern about PayPal is competition from Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOGL) in mobile wallets.""Intensifying competition from the biggest mobile platforms (Apple and Google) could make it challenging for PayPal to establish a leadership position in (mobile commerce),"" Nowak wrote. ""We see the emergence of Apple Pay, Android Pay and Samsung Pay clouding its outlook in mobile and potentially weighing on its multiple.""Others also cite competition.Overseas expansion, however, could boost PayPal's growth, says the Morgan Stanley analyst. He says one possibility is PayPal teaming with China Mobile (CHL), that country's biggest provider of wireless phone services.While some analysts have speculated that PayPal could be a takeover target following its spinoff from eBay, Nowak sees it staying independent near term and forming partnerships.""Winning acceptance with Alibaba seems more likely than Amazon to us, given that PayPal has more to offer to Alibaba's China-based sellers,"" Nowak wrote. ""From a consumer perspective, we think Amazon's one-click functionality may trump the appeal of using the PayPal wallet in the first place.""A PayPal/Alibaba partnership may be more compelling, as it offers Alibaba the potential to tap into U.S.-based buyers. Joseph Tsai, vice chairman at Alibaba, noted in an interview last year that PayPal's footprint outside of China is complementary to its own within China, implying potential for synergies. This may especially be true for Alibaba's cross-border wholesale platforms such as AliExpress and Alibaba.com that connect Chinese manufacturers/sellers with overseas buyers.""

Alibaba stock is down 16% this year.China e-commerce leader Alibaba Group (BABA) is boosting spending on its non-e-commerce ventures and cutting ad prices, moves that will drag down the company's take rates and gross profit margin in upcoming years, said Pacific Crest Securities in a research note released late Sunday.Pacific Crest lowered its gross margin estimates for Alibaba in fiscal years 2016 and 2017, but the investment bankremains ""positive"" about the company's prospects in the longer term, wrote analyst Cheng Cheng.Pacific Crest maintains an overweight rating on Alibaba stock and a price target of 104.Pacific Crest lowered its revenue estimate for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2016, to $16.14 billion, down 3% year over year. Cheng lowered fiscal 2017 revenue estimates to $20.51 billion, down 1%.While cutting estimates, Pacific Crest Securities analyst Cheng Cheng said, ""We remain positive on Alibaba's ability to capture an increasing portion of China's digital economy.""In April, Alibaba cut advertising and commission prices for its Juhuasuan group ad buying platform ""roughly cut in half,"" Cheng said, attempting ""to lower the hurdle for merchant adoption ... and make it more attractive to smaller merchants, particularly those active on Taobao,"" Alibaba's online shopping site, similar to eBay (EBAY) and Amazon.com (AMZN).As a result, Pacific Crest expects a negative impact for the company's ""June-quarter take rates by roughly .1%"" for Taobao and Tmall, as well as both PC and mobile, Cheng said.Even though Alibaba controls more than 80% of China's e-commerce market, Cheng said, ""Internet and e-commerce adoption is still below average in China."" That runway for growth ""should help the company sustain robust revenue growth through at least fiscal year 2017,"" he said.Cheng also lowered gross margin estimates, anticipating increased spending in digital entertainment and other non-e-commerce initiatives, and high growth from lower-margin businesses including cloud computing, mobile browser UCWeb, mapping and navigation firm Autonavi and Alibaba's affiliate advertising network.Alibaba announced last week that it will launch its own online video streaming service in China in a bid to take on Netflix (NFLX).Cheng said, ""We continue to see Alibaba as strongly positioned in its core e-commerce market and in increasingly more adjacent markets like digital media, financial services, location-based services and online-to-offline services. We remain positive on Alibaba's ability to capture an increasing portion of China's digital economy.""Alibaba made the largest-ever U.S. IPO last September, pricing shares at 68.

1113,EBAY,"Technology companies have long been the innovation trendsetters, turning in strong earnings reports that most often put the industry at or near the top of the best-performing groups.That, however, is not expected to be the case with a second-quarter earnings season that begins in earnest Wednesday with chip leader Intel (INTC).The consensus estimate for the 66 tech companies in the S&P 500 is for earnings growth to average just 2% from the year-earlier quarter — despite an expected huge quarter of 39% EPS growth from the biggest company of them all, Apple (AAPL). The strong dollar is hitting U.S. techs, and the PC industry slowdown is also having an impact.The 2% rise puts tech in the middle of the pack among the 10 industry groups in the S&P 500. It's the weakest growth for tech in nine quarters, as reported by Thomson Reuters. The S&P 500 tech companies' earnings per share growth in Q1 averaged 9.7%.""Tech has slowed down and there are not a lot of strong trends driving industry growth,"" said Gregory Harrison, an earnings analyst at Thomson Reuters.The S&P 500 tech companies' EPS growth had averaged 13% in the previous four quarters, more than double that of the S&P 500 overall in that span.The overall estimate for the S&P 500 is for a 3% decline in EPS, but that's due to the ailing energy sector, which is expected to show a 61% drop. Take out the energy sector and EPS growth for the S&P hits 4.6%, more than double the tech average.'Low-Growth Environment'""We're stuck in a low-growth environment, with only modest improvement expected for the rest of the year,"" said Bill Whyman, research analyst at Evercore ISI. ""Tech investors are always looking for acceleration, but expectations for Q2 and the second half of this year have been coming down.""Besides concerns about the strong dollar, the global economic weakness highlighted by the stock crash in Asia and the near-bankruptcy for Greece are among the reasons that 24 of the 66 tech companies in the S&P 500 have lowered their Q2 guidance. Only seven have raised their views.The upcoming release of the Microsoft (MSFT) Windows 10 PC operating system and a new line of microprocessors coming from Intel are not expected to be strong growth drivers. Wearable devices such as smartwatches might be a long-term positive, but that field is just getting under way. The same is true with augmented reality devices.Meanwhile, the seismic industry shift to cloud computing continues to disrupt, says Whyman. That significant technological shift is shaking the rafters of the largest information technology companies, he says.The emergence of cloud computing has shattered old ways of using technology. Companies, rather than buying large volumes of computer servers and storage systems needed for business operations, are instead turning to cloud computing services from Amazon.com (AMZN), Google (GOOGL), Microsoft and IBM (IBM), among others.Moreover, many providers of cloud services are buying lower-cost hardware from Taiwan and China, opting for stripped down hardware of their own design instead of brand-name products.That's hit IBM, Hewlett-Packard (HPQ), Cisco Systems (CSCO), EMC (EMC) and other hardware vendors.Cloud computing has also spurred the growth in software-as-a-service business models. The SaaS model has enabled customers to pay only for what they use, instead of paying hefty fees for some services they don't need. Old-line software makers like Oracle (ORCL) and SAP (SAP) have struggled to shift more of their products to the cloud.This disruption is happening amid slower sales of PCs, smartphones and tablets.Research firm Gartner said PC shipments fell 9.5% in Q2 from Q2 2014, to 68.4 million units. Gartner also lowered its chip sales forecast for the year, now seeing a rise of just 2.2% this year, to $343 billion. It had been forecasting 4% growth.Apple Suppliers UpbeatThat's a problem for Intel, by far the largest maker of PC microprocessors. After the close Wednesday, Intel is expected to post a 7% drop in EPS to 51 cents a share. Revenue is expected to fall 5% to $13.1 billion. Year-over-year sales were flat in the previous quarter.Some Apple chip suppliers, though, have higher expectations. Avago Technologies (AVGO), which supplies chips for the iPhone and other smartphones, is expected to show EPS growth of 70%. Skyworks Solutions, another Apple supplier, is expected to post 54% EPS growth.Overall smartphone growth is slowing, but not at Apple, which is seeing strong growth in sales of its iPhone 6 and 6 Plus line rolled out last fall.Apple reports its June-quarter earnings after the close on July 21. Its expected 39% EPS rise would mark its sixth quarter in a row of double-digit percentage gains. Revenue is expected to climb 33.5% to $50 billion.The slowdown in smartphones, however, is hitting Google (GOOGL) Android phones, which account for the vast majority of overall smartphone sales. Cellphone chip supplier Qualcomm (QCOM) is expected to show a 34% drop in EPS. Its revenue is expected to fall 14% to $5.5 billion. Qualcomm reports after the close on July 22.The tech trends have been a big issue for IBM, which has sold hardware businesses and has posted 12 straight quarters of year-over-year declines in revenue. The 13th quarterly decline is likely ahead. IBM, which reports after the close on July 20, is expected to report a 14% revenue drop, to $20.9 billion.As the buying and selling of goods shifts online, along with advertising and other services, some companies benefit.

1149,EBAY,"EBay gave investors a glimmer of hope as the company inches closer to splitting in two. The leading online auctioneer and e-commerce services company reported first-quarter earnings late Wednesday that beat analyst views as it works through challenges ranging from foreign exchange issues to increased competition with Amazon.com (AMZN) and changing habits of online shoppers.The company's outlook for the current quarter was a mixed bag with earnings ahead of estimates and revenue below views.Shares rose nearly 5% in after-hours trading after ending the day at 56.75, up a fraction.EBay's (EBAY) business is a tale of two cities. The company's online payments service PayPal, the market leader, continues to grow while its Marketplaces unit, which includes online auctions and sales of goods to consumers and businesses, is struggling amid competition from Amazon and others.Late last year, eBay also stumbled due to problems with its search marketing on Google (GOOGL) and a password snafu that frustrated customers. The company also announced a plan in January to cut about 2,400 positions or 7% of its global workforce in advance of the company split, expected to occur in the second half of the year.PayPal continues to grow while the company's Marketplaces business is losing steam partly because of its online auctions, says Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Youssef Squali.""The PayPal business is growing and Marketplaces is sucking wind, because you have the auctions business, which is the old eBay, that business is declining,"" he told IBD. ""People want to go in and buy (stuff) and get out; they don't want to wait 10 days to see if they won an auction or not unless you are buying a collectible that you're not going to find anywhere else.""Amazon's own marketplaces business with third-party sellers and competition from new players such as Etsy (ETSY) are making it more difficult for eBay to differentiate and compete, says Scott Kessler, an analyst for S&P Capital IQ.""There is no lack of competition and as much as eBay over the years kind of retained a lot of its appeal, there is no question that the world has evolved and competitors have emerged,"" he told IBD. ""It's a tough business without question.""In Q1, eBay reported earnings per share minus items of 77 cents a share, up 10% year over year.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected 70 cents.Revenue rose 4.4% to $4.45 billion. Analysts had expected $4.41 billion, or 3.6% growth.For the current quarter eBay expects earnings minus items of 71 cents to 73 cents, up 2.8% to 5.7%.Analysts were expecting 71 cents.The company also expects revenue of $4.4 billion to $4.5 billion, or less than 1% to 3% growth vs. the same quarter last year. Analysts were modeling for $4.57 billion.During a conference call with analysts, eBay CEO John Donahoe said the company is getting back on track as it prepares for the split, which he now expects to take place in the third quarter.""We had a strong first quarter and despite currency headwinds pressuring top line growth, eBay and PayPal are off to a good start for the full year,"" he said. ""I feel very good about the focus and performance of our teams at eBay and PayPal. Each business is executing well with greater focus and operating discipline as we prepare for separation.""In the first quarter, revenue from eBay's online payments business, which is PayPal, grew 14% year over year to $2.1 billion.PayPal continues to show that it isn't giving up its position as the Web's leading online payment service to Apple (AAPL) or anyone else, Kessler says.""Despite all of the hoopla and noise around things like Apple Pay, the reality is that PayPal remains the global leader when it comes to digital payments,"" he said.

Google Wallet is a distant third with 13%, up from 11% in December.""In the wake of Apple's entrance, Google and PayPal have made significant acquisitions, while players such as Facebook (FB) and Samsung are rolling out payment products to remain competitive,"" 451 analyst Jordan McKee said in a statement.Another good sign for Apple Pay is its lead in customer satisfaction. Among Apple Pay users, 66% are ""very satisfied"" with the service. That compares with 45% for PayPal and 33% for Google Wallet, 451 Research said.But security remains a concern.One in four respondents (24%) say mobile payments are more secure than traditional credit cards, while 27% say they're less secure.Apple Pay could get another boost starting Friday when Apple launches its smartwatch, the Apple Watch, in nine countries. Making retail payments with the wave of a wrist is seen as a key selling point for the wearable device.But Apple Pay has had some glitches. A survey last month indicated that two-thirds of Apple Pay users have had problems using the payment service at checkout.RELATED:40% of iPhone 6 owners have used Apple PayApple Pay Overtakes Rivals, But Usage Seen 'Limited'.

1235,EBAY,"Trading is an uncertain endeavor. Some people may struggle with putting their hard-earned money on the line in the market. It's true that all stocks are risky. But investors should summon their courage if they follow sound rules.The chief rule for buying: Get shares in leading stocks only when they break out of bases and the market is in a confirmed uptrend. And go in with an exit strategy to cut losses short if things don't go right.No one likes to lose money. Certainly there will be losing trades along the way. Yet this fact should not discourage you from buying breakouts, the primary setup for stocks featured in IBD.How To Build ConfidenceYou must have good reasons to trust any trading system. Why should IBD's CAN SLIM methodology be trusted?It shows a long history of identifying some of the best performers in the stock market's history at the start of their runs.Huge winners such as America Online (AOL) and JDS Uniphase (JDSU) from the late 1990s to Apple (AAPL), eBay (EBAY) and Netflix (NFLX) in the 2000s could have been uncovered. Catching a monster move in a few leading stocks can change your life.Having a good understanding of the company and its industry can help boost confidence in owning shares. Changes in technology, demographic shifts and other factors can lead to certain industries growing faster than the overall economy. This gives you a ""big picture"" reason to invest.Within these fast-growing industries are companies that have cutting-edge, market-leading products and services. These leading companies tend to have solid top-line and bottom-line growth. Sometimes earnings and/or sales growth will be in the triple digits. IBD features such as The New America, Internet & Technology section, Stock Spotlight and the Sector Leaders Review (today on Page B1) will point you to such stocks.Investors sometimes are gun-shy after a long, sharp market downtrend. Stock prices have been pummeled and investors' sentiment bruised. No one wants to stick their necks out and risk losing money. But note that eventually bad times will end.When the market puts in a powerful follow-through rally , signaling a new uptrend, that's your best cue to begin buying leading stocks. Some of the best stocks will break out of bases just prior to the follow-through or soon after. These tend to end up being the best performers.Making that first buy is critical. Otherwise, you might watch the entire rally from the sidelines, frozen in fear. You don't have to plunge into the market. Just dip your ankle in, and see how things go. If you're making money, then add more positions.On Oct. 16, 2013, the S&P 500 rallied 1.4% in higher trade, marking a follow-through day. In the week ended Oct. 25, Salix Pharmaceuticals (SLXP) cleared a 74.04 buy point from a cup-with-handle base. Volume was weak on the Oct. 24 breakout day, but the drug stock showed strong IBD Ratings.The stock meandered for a couple of weeks (1) before gapping up nearly 18% on Nov. 8 in reaction to its third-quarter results.

Some analysts lowered their price targets on the stock, but Morgan Stanley upgraded it to equal weight from underweight.EBay stock was trading near 55 in the stock market today.Analysts are taking a largely wait-and-see attitude about the company pending more details regarding the separation of eBay and its PayPal payments unit, which the company plans to release in late February.

1277,EBAY,"Samsung took the wraps off its new mobile payment system at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, while eBay's (EBAY) PayPal said it would acquire startup Paydiant, whose digital wallet technology is being used by major retailers.PayPal, which eBay plans to spin off, will reportedly pay about $280 million for Wellesley, Mass.-based Paydiant.Mobile payments is a crowded space, with Apple (AAPL), PayPal and Google (GOOGL) among those aiming to win.Google last month said the biggest U.S. wireless carriers — AT&T (T), T-Mobile US (TMUS) and Verizon Communications (VZ) will pre-install the Google Wallet mobile payments app on Android phones later this year.As part of that deal, Google is acquiring technology and intellectual property from Softcard, a joint venture of wireless firms.Merchant Customer Exchange (MCX) — a retail consortium with powerful backers including Wal-Mart (WMT), Best Buy (BBY) and more than 60 others — is expected to launch its payment system later in 2015. MCX last year agreed to use Paydiant's payment processing technology.Samsung announced its payment system as part of the rollout of the Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge smartphones.Samsung Pay will first be available in Q3 in the U.S. and in South Korea, before being expanded to other markets. Samsung has lined up support from MasterCard (MA) and Visa (V) as well as American Express (AXP), Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C)and JPMorgan Chase (JPM).Security is a key selling point, as with Apple Pay, says Ashwin Shirvaikar, an analyst at Citigroup, said in a research report. Apple introduced Apple Pay in September as part of its iPhone 6 launch.With both systems, users authenticate transactions with their fingerprint. Samsung also employs ""tokenization"" security technology, which generates a single-use, random digital code during transactions, instead of transmitting 16-digit credit-card numbers.Apple Pay uses near-field communications, a short-range wireless technology, to send data to payment readers. Analysts say just 15% of U.S. retail locations have NFC-equipped sales terminals.Samsung Pay supports NFC but also magnetic stripe transmission technology. Samsung recently acquired LoopPay, which developed MST technology for mobile wallets. When launched, the Samsung mobile wallet will be usable at 90% of merchants, says Shirvaikar.Some retailers have opted not to partner with Apple, so Samsung could have an edge, he says.""(MST) capability is difficult for a merchant to block — recall merchants have successfully blocked Apple Pay. MasterCard and Visa credit, debit and prepaid cardholders should be able to use the new Galaxy S6 to pay in store for purchases,"" Shirvaikar wrote.Goldman Sachs analyst Marcus Shin, in a report, said Samsung ""could embed the LoopPay mobile wallet solution into its phones and eventually into wearables, allowing the company to penetrate into the mobile payments landscape ... . While Apple Pay penetration is partly constrained by NFC adoption, this is unlikely to be a key constraint over the long term.""

1279,EBAY,"Steve Jurvetson, a partner at venture capital firm Draper Fisher Jurvetson, is a self-confessed space nut. That's one reason DFJ was an early investor in SpaceX, the manufacturer of rockets and space capsules that was founded by Elon Musk, who is also the founder and CEO of electric car company Tesla Motors (TSLA) and chairman of solar installation leader SolarCity (SCTY).DFJ began investing in SpaceX five years ago. It has invested in other commercial space startups as well, such as Planet Labs, the maker of miniature imaging satellites. Jurvetson recently spoke with IBD about the space business.IBD: What drew you to investing in SpaceX?Jurvetson: Elon Musk is an incredible leader and entrepreneur. I have known him since 1995 when he first came to Silicon Valley. We made offers to invest in what became PayPal (Musk co-founded the online payments company later acquired by eBay (EBAY). We also invested in Solar City and Tesla. We have more investments in the extended Elon Musk family than any other family unit by far.SpaceX is very unusual. I don't know of any other startup where the founder put in $100 million of his own money before looking for any outside capital. They have wildly exceeded any reasonable expectations.IBD: Did DFJ participate in the recent $1 billion funding round in SpaceX that was led by Google (GOOGL) and Fidelity Investments?Jurvetson: We wanted to. There was so much interest that SpaceX turned away many, many hundreds of millions of dollars. They did not let anyone who was currently an investor participate. We had the right to invest but we were asked politely that we not, so SpaceX could accommodate the new investors. The supply and demand was so out of whack that no existing investor could invest in that round.IBD: I assume you are confident of getting a good return on investment from DFJ's earlier funding round?Jurvetson: That is an enormous understatement. I get multiple emails per week from people saying they want to invest (in SpaceX). The most recent one I responded to, because it was a big one, is they wanted to spend $200 million, asking us if we'd be willing to sell that much of our position in SpaceX. We're not going to do that. The dollar amount of buying interest for SpaceX, and space startups in general, is quite high.IBD: Did the success of SpaceX fuel more interest among investors for other space startups?Jurvetson: There is a lot of enthusiasm from investors. When the venture capital industry invests, it's usually because they sense there is money in them hills. And often it takes a high-profile winner to wake everyone up in the category. SpaceX is that company. SpaceX has more than $7.5 billion in revenue backlog. That's a mind-boggling number.IBD: What did SpaceX do that was so disruptive to the space industry?Jurvetson: SpaceX came at it from the view of trying to do things different than the incumbent aerospace companies, looking for a better way of putting satellites into orbit. None of the incumbents had a story of radical change or shaking up the industry on the cost or feasibility side.And Elon's dream of colonizing Mars puts him in a very different space. And if you're thinking of colonizing Mars, you need to think about the depreciation of assets over multiple flights, so then you focus on making the rockets reusable. And you need to find a way to dramatically change the cost structure, which you wouldn't necessarily think to do if all you want to do is launch satellites.This SpaceX dream is many years out, so you come up with solutions that, in the near term, are radically different from any other company because you are motivated to make that work for reasons beyond the current business opportunity. This is an industry that has an incredible amount of inefficiency, and Elon recognizes that.IBD: DFJ also invested in Planet Labs. What do you like about it?Jurvetson: By getting low-cost access to space, it begs the question of what new things can you do that you could not do before. Planet Labs was one of the first companies to have this epiphany, saying if we make the satellites smaller and fly them closer to Earth, we can get the same image with a small lens that an expensive telephoto lens from a large satellite far away can get.And no one had conceived the notion that you could have disposable satellites replaced every year. That was a radical departure from the way every other observation satellite operates.And so the idea was to put 100 small satellites up instead of a large one. Not only do you get the same resolution but you can scan the whole planet faster. You can observe every meter of the planet every day at a much lower cost point — and that's a new market. All kinds of businesses would love to, for example, be able to count every car in every parking lot at every store, every day. And then you also have this enormous array of Big Data, which thousands of companies can think of creative ways to use it.

1330,EBAY,"EBay late Wednesday announced a 7% cut to its workforce and said that it's mulling an IPO for its eBay Enterprise unit, as growth slowed and its Q1 outlook missed views.The company also announced a pact with activist investor Carl Icahn that gives a representative of his company a seat on the board.Amid these announcements, the payments and auctions powerhouse — which said that the spinoff of its PayPal payments unit is on track for Q3 — issued fourth-quarter earnings that narrowly beat analyst forecasts and in-line sales.EBay (EBAY) said that it's exploring ""strategic options"" for its eBay Enterprise unit, including a full or partial sale or IPO. EBay Enterprise develops and runs websites for brick-and-mortar brands and retailers.Revenue growth for the company's e-commerce unit, which it calls its Marketplaces, fell sharply from Q3, indicating slower-than-expected sales in the all-important holiday shopping season. PayPal's revenue growth also slowed from the prior two quarters.""Q4 was disappointing,"" CEO John Donahoe said of Marketplaces in a conference call with analysts after the results were issued.San Jose, Calif.-based eBay reported per-share profit of 90 cents excluding items. That's up 11.1% from the year-earlier quarter and a penny above the consensus estimate of 41 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters.Sales rose 9% to $4.92 billion, a tad below views of $4.93 billion.""(EBay) is growing, but not as fast as the e-commerce benchmarks — and that means they are losing share,"" ChannelAdvisor CEO Scot Wingo told IBD in a pre-earnings interview. ChannelAdvisor (ECOM) tracks and provides software to third-party merchants that sell on big websites such as eBay.PayPal Revenue Growth SlowsPayPal revenue rose 18% year over year, down from 20% in both Q3 and Q2.EBay expects per-share profit minus items this quarter of 68 cents to 71 cents, below analyst views of 76 cents. It sees sales of $4.35 billion to $4.45 billion, missing analyst views of $4.7 billion.Revenue for eBay's Marketplaces unit, which includes auctions, rose 1% to $2.33 billion, down from 6% growth in Q3.ChannelAdvisor's Wingo noted that eBay's Q4 same-store sales grew 6.5% in Q4 vs. Q4 2013, where average e-commerce growth in the quarter was 15% to 16%.""EBay hasn't recovered from the funk they've been in since the spring,"" Wingo said, noting the effects of a cyberattack and a change in Google's (GOOGL) search algorithm filter that hurt eBay's search rankings last year.Wingo says that shoppers bought less at smaller third-party merchants on eBay and other online retailers in Q4, fearing holiday delivery snafus from sellers with less extensive fulfillment systems.EBay said Wednesday that Marketplaces also suffered from unfavorable currency factors in Q4. ""(EBay's) ecosystem was simply disrupted,"" eBay CFO Bob Swan said on the call.RBC analyst Mark Mahaney said in a pre-earnings report that the PayPal spinoff is likely to spur ""a sustained investment period"" in marketing and product development for both PayPal and eBay.Mahaney says that the firm faces rising competition from Apple (AAPL) Pay, Amazon (AMZN) and Alibaba (BABA), as growth in its core Marketplaces segment ""is clearly deteriorating.""EBay's standstill agreement with Icahn formalizes that eBay and PayPal will be separated into two companies. It includes certain corporate governance provisions to be adopted by PayPal as an independent company at its spinoff and appoints Icahn Capital executive Jonathan Christodoro to eBay's board.

1374,EBAY,"Etsy's handcrafted, artisanal listing for a $100 million IPO has perked up would-be investors — but piqued many of its sellers. The online crafts marketplace has always focused on its community as the ""heart and soul"" of the company. As that community, which now numbers 1.4 million active sellers and 19.8 million active buyers, grows, so has the company's cash flow. Revenue jumped 56.4% to $195.6 million in 2014.And this has merchants worried.""(E)tsy is becoming a money machine,"" wrote user Olga in one of the many Etsy forums discussing the IPO news. Olga's shop on the site, Polgani Studio, sells hand-painted silk scarves.She, like many other sellers, voiced concern that the marketplace would become more like eBay (EBAY) and Alibaba's (BABA) AliExpress, and lose its focus on unique crafts.Etsy previously faced user backlash in 2013 when it began permitting sellers to outsource the manufacturing of their designs, as sellers had already complained of cheaply made, mass-produced knockoffs flooding the marketplace.""They are moving away from the 'Handmade' aspect because that's not where the money is,"" wrote seller Kim J of Attis Treasures, which sells items such as loom rubber bands and wood buttons.

1387,EBAY,"Programmatic advertising — using big-data number-crunching and automation to precisely target and sell advertising — is taking off.What does that mean? Well, a coffee company that recognizes your cellphone is in sunny Florida could show you an ad for an iced drink, while someone in a colder clime would get an ad for hot cocoa.The U.S. programmatic advertising market will spike 137% to $10 billion this year, research firm eMarketer said in a report last month, and pass $20 billion in '16.A growing number of companies that sell advertising are turning increasingly to programmatic technology, which they say leads to more efficient ad sales.Yahoo (YHOO) made a splash with its Dec. 15 purchase of BrightRoll, a leading programmatic video ad company, for $640 million in cash.Online marketplace eBay (EBAY) announced in early December that it will halt all its regular ad deals in the U.K. and instead offer only programmatically traded ads for one week in February, as an experiment to gain insight into the ad-buying technology.Sports media giant ESPN, owned by Walt Disney (DIS), announced that some ads for its popular SportsCenter highlights show will be sold through a Web-based programmatic auction in January, rather than via the usual approach where salespeople visit clients face-to-face or take orders vai the phone.And Internet company AOL (AOL) is crediting its purchase of Web video company Adap.TV — which uses computer software to match video ad buyers and sellers — with boosting the percentage of its ad sales made by machine. Adap.TV, purchased for $405 million in August, uses technology to sell precisely targeted video ads in real time, for which advertisers are willing to pay a premium.IBD recently spoke with Bob Lord, global CEO of AOL Platforms, about what the emerging programmatic technology means for that company's ad sales efforts.IBD: When did AOL start using programmatic technology to sell ads?Lord: AOL launched an open platform about three years ago. That was our first foray into programmatic buying for advertisers and agencies. We really walked through three phases, and this last year has been most exciting.The first phase was about education of having people understand what we meant by programmatic. For us, it's automating to gain efficiency and accuracy. The second phase was education about the tools you need ... to pull together a programmatic offer for a client. The last phase is really the growth of programmatic. We've found that year-over-year our programmatic buying — the automated buying that clients are doing with us — has grown from 4% to over 38% of our advertising buy. We've seen a phenomenal shift.IBD: Where are these programmatic ads being sold?Lord: We have access to multiple marketplaces throughout the system, whether that's mobile markets, social markets or display markets. We're even testing in local broadcast TV. If there is (ad) inventory available, we're testing automated placement of advertisements in those marketplaces.IBD: How does this new approach work, compared with the conventional method?Lord: When you look at the overall marketing process, it's one of the last places in the value chain of making consumer goods that has not been mechanized.Now, we can sign into a computer screen and basically tell that computer console that we want to buy $100,000 of ad placement on sites around the Web and on mobile phones to target a particular audience. We can input that into a system that will then automatically go out and find those placements for us, and shoot us back a report to tell us whether it was effective or not.If your $100,000 is being paid out to different places (and) one location is not being effective, it will change that buy and instead buy more of another location that's being more effective. That's optimizing the campaign real-time.In the past, you faxed a request into a media company. They would come back to you with a potential quote on whether or not they could fulfill that order. You would then approve that order and it would get adjudicated, (but) you wouldn't know the result for a period of time. It's not dissimilar to how we used to trade stocks back in 1985 vs. the way we trade stocks today. You and I would never think of faxing in an order for a stock transaction today. We would go online and adjudicate that instantaneously.IBD: How can the system tell in a moment's notice how effective a particular ad is?Lord: Each (ad) campaign has certain objectives, whether it's viewability or click-through rates or commerce transactions. If those objectives aren't being hit, the buy will optimize itself to a location where that is happening. By optimized I mean that if you serve somebody one ad and they don't transact with it, you serve them another ad and send out a lot more of the ads that we know work.IBD: AOL owns several media properties where your clients might place ads. What's the possibility of bias to your own sites?Lord: The automated platform we have is independent of our brand properties. Our brand properties are part of the marketplace that the potential bid goes to. If the (AOL-owned) Huffington Post lifestyle page is performing, we will buy more on the Huffington Lifestyle page. If the New York Times lifestyle page is performing above the Huffington Post, we will buy more on behalf of that advertiser on the NYT lifestyle page.IBD: What does Adap.TV bring to the programmatic ad effort?Lord: Adap.TV brought us into the video marketplace, which was a very important component because consumers are consuming video at a faster rate. Video is where the growth of advertising is coming from.When you think about how brand advertisers — our customers — are asking us to maximize the value of what they are spending, they want to make sure they get to the right audience. Sometimes the audience is on their website. Sometimes they're on their mobile phone. Sometimes they're consuming video. Sometimes they're reading text. Sometimes they're on a social site.By bringing Adap.TV into the fold, we can look at the consumer across all of those mechanisms, and serve the ad where the audience is.IBD: What does this shift mean for your ad salespeople?Lord: There's a need for a more well-rounded ad sales expert in the market. It's a recrafting of the job rather than an elimination of the job. Understanding the data and the analytics behind the data and the algorithms is a really important selling point.

1388,EBAY,"President Obama's weekly remarksHi, everybody. At a moment when our businesses are creating jobs at the fastest pace since the 1990s, we’ve still got to do everything we can to help workers and businesses succeed in the new economy — one that’s competitive, connected, and changing every day.One thing we know for certain about businesses in the 21st century is that they’ll need to sell more goods and services Made in America to the rest of the world.Now, our businesses already sell goods and services in other countries at record levels. Our farmers, our factory workers, and our small businesses are exporting more than ever before — and exporters tend to pay their workers higher wages.More small businesses are using the internet to grow their business by reaching new customers they couldn’t reach before, too. As an example, nine in ten American small businesses that use eBay as a platform to sell their products are exporters — with customers in more than 30 different countries on average.But there’s a lot of room for growth. After all, 95% of the world’s potential customers live outside our borders. Many of them live in the Asia-Pacific — the world’s fastest-growing region. And as we speak, China is trying to write the rules for trade in the 21st century.That would put our workers and our businesses at a massive disadvantage. We can’t let that happen. We should write those rules.That’s why Congress should act on something called “trade promotion authority.” This is bipartisan legislation that would protect American workers, and promote American businesses, with strong new trade deals from Asia to Europe that aren’t just free, but are fair. It would level the playing field for American workers. It would hold all countries to the same high labor and environmental standards to which we hold ourselves.Now, I’m the first to admit that past trade deals haven’t always lived up to the hype. And that’s why we’ve successfully gone after countries that break the rules at our workers’ expense.But that doesn’t mean we should close ourselves off from new opportunities, and sit on the sidelines while other countries write our future for us. We should seize those opportunities. We should make sure the future is written by us. And if we do, we won’t just keep creating good new jobs for decades to come — we’ll make sure that this century is another all-American century. Thanks, and have a great weekend. ####Previous weekly remarks from both parties are available here.RELATED:Jeb Bush's lethal ledgeRob Portman: Obama has added $7.5 trillion in debtGov.

1517,EBAY,"EBay stock fell in after-hours trading Wednesday after the payments and auctions leader, which is spinning off its PayPal unit as a separate company next year, lowered its revenue outlook for the year.The lower outlook came as eBay guided Q4 revenue and earnings below Wall Street expectations.The firm's Q3 sales also came in light as its Marketplaces business slowed, but earnings per share edged views.EBay (EBAY) said that a cyberattack earlier this year, which required a global password reset for all users, had hampered its performance.The San Jose, Calif.-based company reported EPS ex items of 68 cents for Q3, up 6.3% from the year-earlier quarter and a penny above the consensus estimate of 39 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters.Sales rose 11.8% to $4.35 billion, vs. views of $4.37 billion.In the current quarter, eBay expects EPS ex items of 88 cents to 91 cents, the midpoint missing analyst views of 91 cents. It sees sales of $4.85 billion to $4.95 billion. Analysts expected $5.17 billion.The company cut its full-year revenue guidance to $17.85 billion$17.95 billion from its earlier guidance of $18 billion-$18.3 billion. Analysts had modeled $18.15 billion.""EBay is clearly facing some near-term challenges,"" eBay CEO John Donahoe said in a conference call with analysts Wednesday.PayPal, the No. 1 online payments service, saw Q3 revenue surge 20% to $1.95 billion, matching its 20% growth in Q2 and edging 19% year-over-year growth the two prior quarters. PayPal notched 24% growth in Q4 2012.International revenue jumped 14% in Q3 to $2.3 billion. U.S. revenue rose 9% to $2.05 billion.Revenue for eBay's Marketplaces unit, its auctions and e-tail businesses, rose 6% to $2.16 billion, down from 9% growth in Q2 and 10% in Q1.Merchandise Volume Up 9%Gross merchandise volume, the value of all goods and services sold on eBay excluding vehicles, rose 9% to $20.08 billion.""The softer-than-expected results out of Marketplaces were impacted, we suspect, by the lagging effects of the global password reset, which occurred in late May, and Google's (GOOGL) Panda (search algorithm) update,"" Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Youssef Squali said in a post-earnings note to investors.The change in the algorithm hurt eBay's standing in Google search results, analysts have said.EBay disclosed on May 21 that hackers had accessed data on 145 million eBay accounts. It warned users to change their passwords.""PayPal is doing well, but Marketplaces growth is a little slower than expected this year,"" Raymond James analyst Aaron Kessler told IBD in a pre-earnings interview.ChannelAdvisor (ECOM), a software maker that helps third-party retailers sell on big online websites, said this month that same-store sales for clients who sell on eBay rose 8.9% in September vs. September 2013. That figure far exceeded August's 5.9% rise. Still, ChannelAdvisor says eBay's September growth lagged the average e-commerce growth rate for the month of 15%.Yet September marked the first monthly increase in growth rate for eBay since June, ChannelAdvisor said. It said this indicates eBay is rebounding from the impact of the hacker attack and changes in the Google Panda search algorithm.EBay's long-term outlook is ""fundamentally intact,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney said in a research note Monday. But he also said that he's increasingly concerned about the competitive pressures facing Marketplaces and PayPal.EBay's board announced on Sept. 30 that it's separating eBay and PayPal into two independent, publicly traded companies in 2015. Devin Wenig, president of eBay Marketplaces, will head eBay. American Express (AXP) executive Dan Schulman will be PayPal's CEO. Donahoe and CFO Bob Swan will exit their current posts and serve on the boards of both companies.

1542,EBAY,"Alibaba will need more than a hugely successful IPO to pry open the U.S. market.

1543,EBAY,"Being China's dominant e-commerce company doesn't give Alibaba Group (BABA) a leg up in the U.S., where few shoppers know its brand.
"
1544,EBAY,"The Chinese company has done some U.S. M&A, but only with small companies that don't have near the heft of Amazon.com (AMZN) and other bigger e-tailers.
"
1545,EBAY,"The most direct way Alibaba can build its U.S. presence, analysts say, is through a big acquisition or two. And some analysts suggest eBay (EBAY), which recently disclosed that it will split into separate e-commerce and payments (PayPal) companies, is a possible target.
"
1546,EBAY,"While Alibaba has loads of cash from its record $25 billion U.S. IPO in September, a big acquisition could irk U.S. regulators and politicians at a time of rising tensions between Washington and Beijing.
"
1547,EBAY,"In the meantime, Alibaba has room to grow at home. Alibaba boasts 500 million registered users in China, a huge figure that nevertheless is still far less than half the country's population. But it faces mounting competition in China from rivals such as Tencent Holdings (TCEHY) and Baidu (BIDU), and Alibaba founder Jack Ma has his sights set on making Alibaba an international brand.

""Alibaba continues to grow inside China, but also globally. This IPO in New York makes a good entry to the global expansion.""
"
1551,EBAY,"This week, Ma said at a conference that he's open to a partner with Apple's (AAPL) Apple Pay mobile payments service.
"
1552,EBAY,"Alibaba rules the world's fastest-growing and largest e-commerce market, but the company and its mercurial founder, Ma, must gain overseas to keep growing and satisfy investors. The long-term challenge Alibaba faces is similar to ones faced by U.S. counterparts such as Amazon, eBay and Priceline (PCLN), which turned to international markets to maintain high growth rates as U.S. markets matured.
"
1553,EBAY,"But JG Capital analyst Henry Guo doesn't see international markets, including the U.S., becoming a driver of Alibaba's growth for three to five years. ""(Alibaba's) focus now is on China's domestic market,"" Guo said.

1557,EBAY,"Two-Thirds Unfamiliar
"
1558,EBAY,"One of Alibaba's biggest hurdles here is its little-known brand. A recent survey by online retail researcher Bizrate Insights found that 63% of online buyers, skewing toward younger consumers and women, aren't familiar with Alibaba's brand or website. Of the 37% that had heard of Alibaba, only 30% of them (11% overall) said they had browsed the site.
"
1559,EBAY,"""Alibaba has to raise its brand awareness,"" Bizrate Insights Vice President Hayley Silver told IBD.
"
1560,EBAY,"With no U.S.-based e-commerce operation, Silver says consumers have to order items from Alibaba's English-language Chinese website. She says shipping from China is slow and she questions how well Chinese customer service reps would handle complaints. Also, Alibaba's site features made-in-China items, a turn-off for shoppers here who prefer American-made goods.
"
1561,EBAY,"In one of its biggest moves in the U.S., Alibaba has taken a 39% stake in San Mateo, Calif.-based ShopRunner, a smaller, members-only rival of Amazon. Headed by former Yahoo (YHOO) CEO Scott Thompson, ShopRunner offers free shipping for online orders in a program that resembles Amazon Prime.
"
1562,EBAY,"ShopRunner is preparing a joint service with Alibaba that provides U.S. brands with a direct way to sell to China's consumers. When it's up and running, the 300 million-plus Chinese users of Alibaba's AliPay payments service will be able to order products directly from the U.S. websites of ShopRunner partners like Neiman Marcus (NMG) and Nine West, and have the goods delivered from the U.S. to China in 10 days.
"
1563,EBAY,"The joint service reportedly will launch by year-end. A ShopRunner spokesperson declined to comment. But when it does launch, the China-centric Alibaba/ShopRunner partnership likely will do little to churn up business for Alibaba with U.S. shoppers.
"
1564,EBAY,"Alibaba's only direct foray into U.S. e-commerce so far has more of a PR angle than scale. In June, it launched 11 Main, a small online retail website that touts distinctly U.S. goods and crafts from U.S. vendors.

1565,EBAY,"With the motivation and the money, some observes expect Alibaba will make a big acquisition in the U.S. Wedbush Securities analyst Gil Luria said in an Oct. 1 report that eBay's Marketplaces businesses makes it a tempting target for Alibaba. Marketplaces is second only to Amazon in e-commerce sales.
"
1566,EBAY,"But Carnegie Towers' Tang says Alibaba could get U.S. traction by acting as an intermediary between buyers and sellers, similar to what eBay does now and something it could do without acquiring eBay.
"
1567,EBAY,"Tang says Alibaba could rely on the in-house inventories of U.S. brands and makers who sell on its site. He says it could rely on the existing facilities of these sellers and shippers like UPS (UPS) and FedEx (FDX) without building a fulfillment network like Amazon.

"
1592,EBAY,"Jason Weiner is like Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers.
"
1593,EBAY,"Season after season, he keeps performing at a high level.
"
1594,EBAY,"Since Feb. 2, 2007, when Weiner became the signal caller for the now $1.3 billion Fidelity Growth Discovery Fund and its adviser-sold twin $2.8 billion Advisor Equity Growth Fund , Growth Discovery has notched an 8.48% average annual gain vs. 7.03% for the S&P 500. Its performance ranks in the top 30% of its large-cap growth peers, tracked by Morningstar Inc.
"
1595,EBAY,"Weiner has used the same approach for most if not all of his tenure, he says. He seeks undervalued growth stories and stocks with potential for price-earnings expansion, avoiding overly costly names.
"
1596,EBAY,"Weiner, 45 years old, talked with IBD from his office in Boston about how he invests.
"
1597,EBAY,"IBD: Jason, if you ever had a mentor, who was it?
"
1598,EBAY,"Weiner: I've had tons of mentors. On the rare occasions when (Fidelity) rolls me out to meet MBAs visiting Fidelity, I tell them they should find a mentor, either outside their workplace or inside, or preferably both.
"
1599,EBAY,"It's super important, going back to when I was 15 and had my first job. I got it from a family friend, Lou, who was a great influence. It was Lou Nargiso, and he owned a gas station-auto repair shop. He was a World War II vet, and he learned auto repair in the army.
"
1600,EBAY,"He was a very well-educated person and philosophical. He liked to debate things. Everyone who worked for Lou was very loyal to him, as was he to them. His shop was also kind of a clubhouse for his World War II vet buddies, and I hung out with them. Good times!
"
1601,EBAY,"IBD: And at Fidelity?
"
1602,EBAY,"Weiner: At Fidelity, Will Danoff (manager of Fidelity's $111.1 billion Contrafund , $28.9 billion Advisor New Insights , $6.4 billion Series Opportunistic Insights and $884.8 million Advisor Series Opportunistic Insights has been a great mentor.
"
1603,EBAY,"I don't remember exactly when it kicked off. It might have been around 1993. We were both on a train. Will was going to southern Connecticut, visiting his parents. We sat next to each other. I worked for him later. I gained a lot of wisdom. Will is super focused on studying each decade, understanding monster stocks in each decade, and being in the elephant-hunting business — hunting stocks that go on to make monster gains.
"
1604,EBAY,"If you owned Dell in 1990, for the next 10 years nothing else mattered. It's the beauty of incredible growth stories. Will was focused on that, and I have adopted that strategy.
"
1605,EBAY,"IBD: Overall, you look for undervalued growth stories and stocks with potential for price-earnings expansion, right?
"
1606,EBAY,"Weiner: You only get paid for two things with growth stocks. First, for P-E expansion. Second, for underlying earnings growth of the companies you invest in.
"
1607,EBAY,"Typically, I focus on the growth rate of companies. That's where fundamental research can bring value. And I try to leverage Fidelity's research engine a lot.
"
1608,EBAY,"It's a little harder to predict P-E.
"
1609,EBAY,"IBD: And you try to avoid valuations that are too high, correct?
"
1610,EBAY,"Weiner: If you can enter a name you like when there's controversy or doubt that casts its P-E lower, that's a great opportunity.
"
1611,EBAY,"IBD: Give me an example, please.
"
1612,EBAY,"Weiner: The best in recent years is Facebook (FB), after Facebook botched its IPO.
"
1613,EBAY,"The stock had gone public (at 38) and traded down immediately. It bottomed around 17 even though the company was doing great. But there were clouds of controversy that pummeled the stock.
"
1614,EBAY,"I bought after the IPO. I didn't buy it all on one day. My (average price per share) was in the 20s.
"
1615,EBAY,"While the stock was going down, the company was rolling out newsfeed ads. It seems like ancient history, but newsfeed ads are relatively new. About the time of the IPO, they stopped relying on ads for PC-based service and shifted to newsfeed ads that appeared on mobile devices. It was a fundamental transformation of their business model. That's Facebook's story today.
"
1616,EBAY,"IBD: Should people think of Growth Discovery as a GARP (growth at a reasonable price) strategy?
"
1617,EBAY,"Weiner: A lot of the fund would be recognizable as a GARP basket. That's OK. But in addition, I try to buy the best growth names in the market, the ones that are going to turn into big, sustainable, valuable franchises. That's a little different from GARP.
"
1618,EBAY,"My top 40 names are 65% of my assets. Not every name will become a brand-new, unbelievable franchise. Some already have great franchises. Some will become great. But if you look at every decade — and I know this from some of the publications that William O'Neil sends me — in the '60s, '70s, '80s, '90s and so on, and look at the monster stocks, there are never that many. I try to buy those sorts of names.
"
1619,EBAY,"IBD: You are allowed to invest in any market-cap size, but the fund has been large-cap oriented for a long time. Its heaviest weighting was in megacaps as of Sept. 30. Why those, why U.S. ones?
"
1620,EBAY,"Weiner: Let's take the U.S. piece first. The U.S. economy is doing better than the average developed nation's, so it's fortuitous to be U.S. investors in this day.
"
1621,EBAY,"And why so many megacaps? If you look at Internet models, the (successful) ones are global, scalable, enjoy incredible network effects and are viral. That's what we want.
"
1622,EBAY,"I point to Facebook. The biggest companies, like that, enjoy increased returns as they get bigger.
"
1623,EBAY,"If you were a manufacturer 50 years ago, you might have experienced decreasing returns for every single additional widget you made. They had to be sold at lower margins to incent the market to buy your product. In the Internet age, it's the opposite: increased returns.
"
1624,EBAY,"The other thing about the Internet is that it's a winner-takes-the-most dynamic. Google (GOOGL) is the leader in search. That is a winner-takes-all battle, and they won.
"
1625,EBAY,"It's to be determined in the OTA (online travel agency) space. You've got Facebook, Expedia (EXPE), TripAdvisor (TRIP) and a bunch of other ones. (This may also turn into a winner-takes-all space.) That's why we haven't invested in Priceline (PCLN). I have no skin in that game.
"
1626,EBAY,"IBD: Why did you boost your Apple (AAPL) weighting to 5.8% as of Oct. 31 from less than 1% as of March 31 and 2.3% as of June 30?
"
1627,EBAY,"Weiner: Full disclosure: I have not done a great job trading Apple in the last five years. I give myself low marks on that one. I can make a long list of Apple's positives and negatives. I've focused on the negatives in the last five years. I'm not going to do that any more.
"
1628,EBAY,"I live two blocks from an Apple store. When the iPhone 6 came out there was a line around the block. It was crazy. I can't ignore that.
"
1629,EBAY,"I could lecture about how smartphones are fully penetrated and the rate of innovation is slowing down. And how Android has outshipped Apple iOS five to one and usually the volume leader wins in tech. Actually, it always does! But the negatives haven't mattered (to Apple's stock performance).
"
1630,EBAY,"IBD: So you've decided — at least for the moment — that all is not lost for Apple?
"
1631,EBAY,"Weiner: One of the key buckets of stock I've avoided is large-cap tech legacy players: Oracle (ORCL), EMC (EMC), Hewlett-Packard (HPQ), Microsoft (MSFT) and on and on. I generally underweight them. I'm mindful that they have secular challenges. When that happens, you never know if they will catch up. IBM (IBM) for years faced them but somehow always punched out good earnings. But that may be changing. Last quarter was terrible for them.
"
1632,EBAY,"When secular challenges catch up to a company, it's all over. In the 1990s, I was a tech analyst covering Compaq, Tandem, Digital, Stratus, Data General. They faced secular challenges. When the wave hit, they fell over. They don't exist now (as independent companies).
"
1633,EBAY,"Apple is a huge, good legacy story relative to other legacy players. That's another justification for owning Apple.
"
1634,EBAY,"IBD: You held Illumina (ILMN) as of Oct. 31. You're a fan of the outlook for gene sequencing, right?
"
1635,EBAY,"Weiner: Yes. Illumina is an incredible company, helping to unlock the secrets of sequencing genomes for just $1,000. The way we practice medicine is changing because of companies like Illumina.
"
1636,EBAY,"If you look backwards, people were doing one human genome. Now they're sequencing thousands. In the future, you will have your genome when you go to the doctor. That's where Illumina comes in.
"
1637,EBAY,"IBD: Will Alexion (ALXN) remain a play on a single drug, Soliris?
"
1638,EBAY,"Weiner: My Alexion thesis (as of my latest disclosure) was this: they are a super orphan-drug company. They only go after indications with small patient populations, where they get a lot of money for life-saving drugs.
"
1639,EBAY,"They've increased the number of indications Soliris is sold for. And behind that there is another drug they're hoping for FDA approval for, for a new set of indications.
"
1640,EBAY,"It's hard for society to say it will not pay for a drug, and your child will live for only a couple of years. If society pays for the drug, your child will have a normal outcome. It's a big ethics debate. But bottom line: countries are paying for these drugs.
"
1641,EBAY,"IBD: How similar is Gilead's (GILD) story?
"
1642,EBAY,"Weiner: They have great risk-reward. They beat the competition. There will be others with cures for hepatitis C. They will get market share. But Gilead will get the majority market share. If you have hep C, you want this drug immediately.
"
1643,EBAY,"One knock against the drug is that some people don't like to invest in companies that cure a disease. Then the treatment is a one-shot deal. Some people say, 'Isn't it better to develop a treatment for HIV that requires patients to take a pill every day?' But there's still plenty of room for the hep C drug. There are millions of patients who don't have the drug yet.
"
1644,EBAY,"IBD: Chipotle's (CMG) earnings growth has accelerated for two quarters.
"
1645,EBAY,"Weiner: It's a great franchise with tons of room for growth. The secret is that people will pay more for food that they think is higher quality.
"
1646,EBAY,"IBD: What about Sherwin-Williams (SHW)?
"
1647,EBAY,"Weiner: This is one of the greatest companies that nobody recognizes.
"
1648,EBAY,"Their paint store franchise is so valuable. They're vertically integrated. Professional painters make their first daily stop at Sherwin-Williams, not Home Depot (HD) or Lowe's (LOW). They know how to treat pros. They have lots of pricing power. Material costs are not a big deal. Most (end users) are people restoring or remodeling homes. It does not depend on home sales.
"
1649,EBAY,"IBD: What drives Ulta Beauty (ULTA)?
"
1650,EBAY,"Weiner: What I like about Ulta is that beauty has high emotional content for women. Ulta gives them the ability to walk into a mall-based, completely dedicated beauty retailer and not have to walk halfway across a department store to get to a beauty counter. And Ulta has a growing number of prestige brands. Years ago, prestige brands wouldn't sell through them. Now they do.
"
1651,EBAY,"Beauty products have high margins. Profits, same-store sales, sales per square foot are all growing.
"
1652,EBAY,"Last year, profits had actually been muted. The CEO (Mary Dillon) is investing heavily in e-commerce. She told a credible story to the Street about what her investments can do, so people are on board.
"
1653,EBAY,"IBD: You were a fan of Alibaba (BABA) as of your latest disclosure, right?
"
1654,EBAY,"Weiner: Alibaba is like the legend with that name. In 100 years, people will talk about (CEO) Jack Ma in those terms. This is the e-commerce leader in China. Full stop. China is a big market that is growing.
"
1655,EBAY,"Jack Ma has done a very good job of building a huge business with massive gross merchandise value. He's attracted merchants with a low take rate. That means for a small or medium business, Alibaba is a great tool to grow your business.
"
1656,EBAY,"He also has G Mall, the place where global brands can sell in a safe place where there are no counterfeits there.
"
1657,EBAY,"And he's got payments and financial services in his back pocket.
"
1658,EBAY,"Alibaba's gross merchandise value is larger than Amazon (AMZN) and eBay's (EBAY) combined.Jason Weiner is like Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers.Season after season, he keeps performing at a high level.Since Feb. 2, 2007, when Weiner became the signal caller for the now $1.3 billion Fidelity Growth Discovery Fund and its adviser-sold twin $2.8 billion Advisor Equity Growth Fund , Growth Discovery has notched an 8.48% average annual gain vs. 7.03% for the S&P 500.

1672,EBAY,"Amazon.com (AMZN) and Google sharply outpaced the rest of U.S. e-commerce in their September same-store sales, according to data from ChannelAdvisor, a software maker that helps third-party retailers sell on big online websites.EBay (EBAY), which said on Sept. 30 that it's spinning off payments unit PayPal, showed more mixed results, underperforming the industry's average growth.ChannelAdvisor (ECOM) CEO Scot Wingo said in a blog post Wednesday that company clients who sell on Amazon saw their September same-store sales (for online-store channels open at least a year) surge 37.9%. This was a slip vs. August's 45.1% increase for Amazon. But Wingo said Amazon's jump is more than twice the average growth rate for U.S. e-commerce overall, which ChannelAdvisor pegs at about 15%, including both desktop and mobile transactions.EBay's September same-store growth came in at 8.9%, up from 5.9% in August but below the average e-commerce growth rate. EBay's auctions were down 4.1% from the same month a year earlier. On the upside, Wingo says September marked the first uptick in eBay's same-store sales since June and indicates that eBay is ""recovering"" from a major hacker attack that occurred early this year and issues involving changes in Google's search algorithm. The changes hurt eBay's placement in Google search results.Same-store sales tied to Google Shopping, Google's (GOOGL) e-commerce search service, rose 45.2% in September, slowing from August's 54.3% pace. That's above the average September growth rate for U.S. e-tailers.Google's performance, Wingo says, ""is likely due to the improved consumer outlook as well as Google tweaking the algorithm to continue to show higher priced goods"" to consumers.RELATED:EBay Price Target Raised On M&A PossibilityAmazon Holiday Deals Program For Sellers Goes Global.

1701,EBAY,"Text of President Obama's 2015 State of the Union Address Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, my fellow Americans: We are fifteen years into this new century.  Fifteen years that dawned with terror touching our shores; that unfolded with a new generation fighting two long and costly wars; that saw a vicious recession spread across our nation and the world.  It has been, and still is, a hard time for many.  But tonight, we turn the page.Tonight, after a breakthrough year for America, our economy is growing and creating jobs at the fastest pace since 1999.  Our unemployment rate is now lower than it was before the financial crisis.  More of our kids are graduating than ever before; more of our people are insured than ever before; we are as free from the grip of foreign oil as we’ve been in almost 30 years.Tonight, for the first time since 9/11, our combat mission in Afghanistan is over.  Six years ago, nearly 180,000 American troops served in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Today, fewer than 15,000 remain.  And we salute the courage and sacrifice of every man and woman in this 9/11 Generation who has served to keep us safe.  We are humbled and grateful for your service.America, for all that we’ve endured; for all the grit and hard work required to come back; for all the tasks that lie ahead, know this:  The shadow of crisis has passed, and the State of the Union is strong.At this moment — with a growing economy, shrinking deficits, bustling industry, and booming energy production — we have risen from recession freer to write our own future than any other nation on Earth.  It’s now up to us to choose who we want to be over the next fifteen years, and for decades to come.Will we accept an economy where only a few of us do spectacularly well?  Or will we commit ourselves to an economy that generates rising incomes and chances for everyone who makes the effort?Will we approach the world fearful and reactive, dragged into costly conflicts that strain our military and set back our standing?  Or will we lead wisely, using all elements of our power to defeat new threats and protect our planet?Will we allow ourselves to be sorted into factions and turned against one another — or will we recapture the sense of common purpose that has always propelled America forward?In two weeks, I will send this Congress a budget filled with ideas that are practical, not partisan.  And in the months ahead, I’ll crisscross the country making a case for those ideas.So tonight, I want to focus less on a checklist of proposals, and focus more on the values at stake in the choices before us.It begins with our economy.Seven years ago, Rebekah and Ben Erler of Minneapolis were newlyweds.  She waited tables.  He worked construction.  Their first child, Jack, was on the way.They were young and in love in America, and it doesn’t get much better than that.“If only we had known,” Rebekah wrote to me last spring, “what was about to happen to the housing and construction market.”As the crisis worsened, Ben’s business dried up, so he took what jobs he could find, even if they kept him on the road for long stretches of time.  Rebekah took out student loans, enrolled in community college, and retrained for a new career.  They sacrificed for each other.  And slowly, it paid off.  They bought their first home.  They had a second son, Henry.  Rebekah got a better job, and then a raise.  Ben is back in construction — and home for dinner every night.“It is amazing,” Rebekah wrote, “what you can bounce back from when you have to…we are a strong, tight-knit family who has made it through some very, very hard times.”We are a strong, tight-knit family who has made it through some very, very hard times.America, Rebekah and Ben’s story is our story.  They represent the millions who have worked hard, and scrimped, and sacrificed, and retooled.  You are the reason I ran for this office.  You’re the people I was thinking of six years ago today, in the darkest months of the crisis, when I stood on the steps of this Capitol and promised we would rebuild our economy on a new foundation.  And it’s been your effort and resilience that has made it possible for our country to emerge stronger.<[>We believed we could reverse the tide of outsourcing, and draw new jobs to our shores.  And over the past five years, our businesses have created more than 11 million new jobs.We believed we could reduce our dependence on foreign oil and protect our planet.  And today, America is number one in oil and gas.  America is number one in wind power.  Every three weeks, we bring online as much solar power as we did in all of 2008.  And thanks to lower gas prices and higher fuel standards, the typical family this year should save $750 at the pump.We believed we could prepare our kids for a more competitive world.  And today, our younger students have earned the highest math and reading scores on record.  Our high school graduation rate has hit an all-time high.  And more Americans finish college than ever before.We believed that sensible regulations could prevent another crisis, shield families from ruin, and encourage fair competition.  Today, we have new tools to stop taxpayer-funded bailouts, and a new consumer watchdog to protect us from predatory lending and abusive credit card practices.  And in the past year alone, about ten million uninsured Americans finally gained the security of health coverage.At every step, we were told our goals were misguided or too ambitious; that we would crush jobs and explode deficits.  Instead, we’ve seen the fastest economic growth in over a decade, our deficits cut by two-thirds, a stock market that has doubled, and health care inflation at its lowest rate in fifty years.So the verdict is clear.  Middle-class economics works.  Expanding opportunity works.  And these policies will continue to work, as long as politics don’t get in the way.  We can’t slow down businesses or put our economy at risk with government shutdowns or fiscal showdowns.  We can’t put the security of families at risk by taking away their health insurance, or unraveling the new rules on Wall Street, or refighting past battles on immigration when we’ve got a system to fix.  And if a bill comes to my desk that tries to do any of these things, it will earn my veto.Today, thanks to a growing economy, the recovery is touching more and more lives.  Wages are finally starting to rise again.  We know that more small business owners plan to raise their employees’ pay than at any time since 2007.  But here’s the thing — those of us here tonight, we need to set our sights higher than just making sure government doesn’t halt the progress we’re making.  We need to do more than just do no harm.  Tonight, together, let’s do more to restore the link between hard work and growing opportunity for every American. Because families like Rebekah’s still need our help.  She and Ben are working as hard as ever, but have to forego vacations and a new car so they can pay off student loans and save for retirement.  Basic childcare for Jack and Henry costs more than their mortgage, and almost as much as a year at the University of Minnesota.  Like millions of hardworking Americans, Rebekah isn’t asking for a handout, but she is asking that we look for more ways to help families get ahead.In fact, at every moment of economic change throughout our history, this country has taken bold action to adapt to new circumstances, and to make sure everyone gets a fair shot.  We set up worker protections, Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid to protect ourselves from the harshest adversity.  We gave our citizens schools and colleges, infrastructure and the internet — tools they needed to go as far as their effort will take them.That’s what middle-class economics is — the idea that this country does best when everyone gets their fair shot, everyone does their fair share, and everyone plays by the same set of rules.  We don’t just want everyone to share in America’s success — we want everyone to contribute to our success.So what does middle-class economics require in our time?First — middle-class economics means helping working families feel more secure in a world of constant change.  That means helping folks afford childcare, college, health care, a home, retirement — and my budget will address each of these issues, lowering the taxes of working families and putting thousands of dollars back into their pockets each year.Here’s one example.  During World War II, when men like my grandfather went off to war, having women like my grandmother in the workforce was a national security priority — so this country provided universal childcare.  In today’s economy, when having both parents in the workforce is an economic necessity for many families, we need affordable, high-quality childcare more than ever.It’s not a nice-to-have — it’s a must-have.  It’s time we stop treating childcare as a side issue, or a women’s issue, and treat it like the national economic priority that it is for all of us.  And that’s why my plan will make quality childcare more available, and more affordable, for every middle-class and low-income family with young children in America — by creating more slots and a new tax cut of up to $3,000 per child, per year.Here’s another example.  Today, we’re the only advanced country on Earth that doesn’t guarantee paid sick leave or paid maternity leave to our workers.  Forty-three million workers have no paid sick leave.  Forty-three million.  Think about that.  And that forces too many parents to make the gut-wrenching choice between a paycheck and a sick kid at home.  So I’ll be taking new action to help states adopt paid leave laws of their own.And since paid sick leave won where it was on the ballot last November, let’s put it to a vote right here in Washington.  Send me a bill that gives every worker in America the opportunity to earn seven days of paid sick leave.  It’s the right thing to do.Of course, nothing helps families make ends meet like higher wages.  That’s why this Congress still needs to pass a law that makes sure a woman is paid the same as a man for doing the same work.  Really.  It’s 2015.  It’s time.  We still need to make sure employees get the overtime they’ve earned.  And to everyone in this Congress who still refuses to raise the minimum wage, I say this:  If you truly believe you could work full-time and support a family on less than $15,000 a year, go try it.  If not, vote to give millions of the hardest-working people in America a raise.These ideas won’t make everybody rich, or relieve every hardship.  That’s not the job of government.  To give working families a fair shot, we’ll still need more employers to see beyond next quarter’s earnings and recognize that investing in their workforce is in their company’s long-term interest.We still need laws that strengthen rather than weaken unions, and give American workers a voice. But things like child care and sick leave and equal pay; things like lower mortgage premiums and a higher minimum wage — these ideas will make a meaningful difference in the lives of millions of families.  That is a fact.  And that’s what all of us — Republicans and Democrats alike — were sent here to do.Second, to make sure folks keep earning higher wages down the road, we have to do more to help Americans upgrade their skills.America thrived in the 20th century because we made high school free, sent a generation of GIs to college, and trained the best workforce in the world.  But in a 21st century economy that rewards knowledge like never before, we need to do more.By the end of this decade, two in three job openings will require some higher education.  Two in three.  And yet, we still live in a country where too many bright, striving Americans are priced out of the education they need.  It’s not fair to them, and it’s not smart for our future.That’s why I am sending this Congress a bold new plan to lower the cost of community college — to zero.  Forty percent of our college students choose community college.  Some are young and starting out.  Some are older and looking for a better job.  Some are veterans and single parents trying to transition back into the job market.  Whoever you are, this plan is your chance to graduate ready for the new economy, without a load of debt.  Understand, you’ve got to earn it — you’ve got to keep your grades up and graduate on time.Tennessee, a state with Republican leadership, and Chicago, a city with Democratic leadership, are showing that free community college is possible.  I want to spread that idea all across America, so that two years of college becomes as free and universal in America as high school is today.  And I want to work with this Congress, to make sure Americans already burdened with student loans can reduce their monthly payments, so that student debt doesn’t derail anyone’s dreams.Thanks to Vice President Biden’s great work to update our job training system, we’re connecting community colleges with local employers to train workers to fill high-paying jobs like coding, and nursing, and robotics.  Tonight, I’m also asking more businesses to follow the lead of companies like CVS and UPS, and offer more educational benefits and paid apprenticeships — opportunities that give workers the chance to earn higher-paying jobs even if they don’t have a higher education.And as a new generation of veterans comes home, we owe them every opportunity to live the American Dream they helped defend.  Already, we’ve made strides towards ensuring that every veteran has access to the highest quality care.  We’re slashing the backlog that had too many veterans waiting years to get the benefits they need, and we’re making it easier for vets to translate their training and experience into civilian jobs.Joining Forces, the national campaign launched by Michelle and Jill Biden, has helped nearly 700,000 veterans and military spouses get new jobs. So to every CEO in America, let me repeat:  If you want somebody who’s going to get the job done, hire a veteran.Finally, as we better train our workers, we need the new economy to keep churning out high-wage jobs for our workers to fill.Since 2010, America has put more people back to work than Europe, Japan, and all advanced economies combined.  Our manufacturers have added almost 800,000 new jobs.  Some of our bedrock sectors, like our auto industry, are booming.  But there are also millions of Americans who work in jobs that didn’t even exist ten or twenty years ago — jobs at companies like Google, and eBay, and Tesla.So no one knows for certain which industries will generate the jobs of the future.  But we do know we want them here in America.  That’s why the third part of middle-class economics is about building the most competitive economy anywhere, the place where businesses want to locate and hire.21st century businesses need 21st century infrastructure — modern ports, stronger bridges, faster trains and the fastest internet.  Democrats and Republicans used to agree on this.  So let’s set our sights higher than a single oil pipeline.  Let’s pass a bipartisan infrastructure plan that could create more than thirty times as many jobs per year, and make this country stronger for decades to come.21st century businesses, including small businesses, need to sell more American products overseas.  Today, our businesses export more than ever, and exporters tend to pay their workers higher wages. But as we speak, China wants to write the rules for the world’s fastest-growing region.  That would put our workers and businesses at a disadvantage.  Why would we let that happen?  We should write those rules.  We should level the playing field.  That’s why I’m asking both parties to give me trade promotion authority to protect American workers, with strong new trade deals from Asia to Europe that aren’t just free, but fair.Look, I’m the first one to admit that past trade deals haven’t always lived up to the hype, and that’s why we’ve gone after countries that break the rules at our expense.  But ninety-five percent of the world’s customers live outside our borders, and we can’t close ourselves off from those opportunities. More than half of manufacturing executives have said they’re actively looking at bringing jobs back from China.  Let’s give them one more reason to get it done.21st century businesses will rely on American science, technology, research and development.  I want the country that eliminated polio and mapped the human genome to lead a new era of medicine — one that delivers the right treatment at the right time.  In some patients with cystic fibrosis, this approach has reversed a disease once thought unstoppable.  Tonight, I’m launching a new Precision Medicine Initiative to bring us closer to curing diseases like cancer and diabetes — and to give all of us access to the personalized information we need to keep ourselves and our families healthier.I intend to protect a free and open internet, extend its reach to every classroom, and every community, and help folks build the fastest networks, so that the next generation of digital innovators and entrepreneurs have the platform to keep reshaping our world.I want Americans to win the race for the kinds of discoveries that unleash new jobs — converting sunlight into liquid fuel; creating revolutionary prosthetics, so that a veteran who gave his arms for his country can play catch with his kid; pushing out into the Solar System not just to visit, but to stay.  Last month, we launched a new spacecraft as part of a re-energized space program that will send American astronauts to Mars.  In two months, to prepare us for those missions, Scott Kelly will begin a year-long stay in space.  Good luck, Captain — and make sure to Instagram it.Now, the truth is, when it comes to issues like infrastructure and basic research, I know there’s bipartisan support in this chamber.  Members of both parties have told me so.  Where we too often run onto the rocks is how to pay for these investments.  As Americans, we don’t mind paying our fair share of taxes, as long as everybody else does, too.  But for far too long, lobbyists have rigged the tax code with loopholes that let some corporations pay nothing while others pay full freight.  They’ve riddled it with giveaways the superrich don’t need, denying a break to middle class families who do.This year, we have an opportunity to change that.  Let’s close loopholes so we stop rewarding companies that keep profits abroad, and reward those that invest in America.  Let’s use those savings to rebuild our infrastructure and make it more attractive for companies to bring jobs home.Let’s simplify the system and let a small business owner file based on her actual bank statement, instead of the number of accountants she can afford. And let’s close the loopholes that lead to inequality by allowing the top one percent to avoid paying taxes on their accumulated wealth.  We can use that money to help more families pay for childcare and send their kids to college.  We need a tax code that truly helps working Americans trying to get a leg up in the new economy, and we can achieve that together.Helping hardworking families make ends meet. Giving them the tools they need for good-paying jobs in this new economy.  Maintaining the conditions for growth and competitiveness.  This is where America needs to go.  I believe it’s where the American people want to go.  It will make our economy stronger a year from now, fifteen years from now, and deep into the century ahead.Of course, if there’s one thing this new century has taught us, it’s that we cannot separate our work at home from challenges beyond our shores.My first duty as Commander-in-Chief is to defend the United States of America.  In doing so, the question is not whether America leads in the world, but how.  When we make rash decisions, reacting to the headlines instead of using our heads; when the first response to a challenge is to send in our military — then we risk getting drawn into unnecessary conflicts, and neglect the broader strategy we need for a safer, more prosperous world.  That’s what our enemies want us to do.I believe in a smarter kind of American leadership.  We lead best when we combine military power with strong diplomacy; when we leverage our power with coalition building; when we don’t let our fears blind us to the opportunities that this new century presents.  That’s exactly what we’re doing right now — and around the globe, it is making a difference.First, we stand united with people around the world who’ve been targeted by terrorists — from a school in Pakistan to the streets of Paris.  We will continue to hunt down terrorists and dismantle their networks, and we reserve the right to act unilaterally, as we’ve done relentlessly since I took office to take out terrorists who pose a direct threat to us and our allies. At the same time, we’ve learned some costly lessons over the last thirteen years.Instead of Americans patrolling the valleys of Afghanistan, we’ve trained their security forces, who’ve now taken the lead, and we’ve honored our troops’ sacrifice by supporting that country’s first democratic transition.  Instead of sending large ground forces overseas, we’re partnering with nations from South Asia to North Africa to deny safe haven to terrorists who threaten America.In Iraq and Syria, American leadership — including our military power — is stopping ISIL’s advance.  Instead of getting dragged into another ground war in the Middle East, we are leading a broad coalition, including Arab nations, to degrade and ultimately destroy this terrorist group.  We’re also supporting a moderate opposition in Syria that can help us in this effort, and assisting people everywhere who stand up to the bankrupt ideology of violent extremism.  This effort will take time.  It will require focus.  But we will succeed.  And tonight, I call on this Congress to show the world that we are united in this mission by passing a resolution to authorize the use of force against ISIL.Second, we are demonstrating the power of American strength and diplomacy.  We’re upholding the principle that bigger nations can’t bully the small — by opposing Russian aggression, supporting Ukraine’s democracy, and reassuring our NATO allies.  Last year, as we were doing the hard work of imposing sanctions along with our allies, some suggested that Mr. Putin’s aggression was a masterful display of strategy and strength.  Well, today, it is America that stands strong and united with our allies, while Russia is isolated, with its economy in tatters.That’s how America leads — not with bluster, but with persistent, steady resolve.In Cuba, we are ending a policy that was long past its expiration date.  When what you’re doing doesn’t work for fifty years, it’s time to try something new.  Our shift in Cuba policy has the potential to end a legacy of mistrust in our hemisphere; removes a phony excuse for restrictions in Cuba; stands up for democratic values; and extends the hand of friendship to the Cuban people.  And this year, Congress should begin the work of ending the embargo.  As His Holiness, Pope Francis, has said, diplomacy is the work of “small steps.”  These small steps have added up to new hope for the future in Cuba.  And after years in prison, we’re overjoyed that Alan Gross is back where he belongs.  Welcome home, Alan. Our diplomacy is at work with respect to Iran, where, for the first time in a decade, we’ve halted the progress of its nuclear program and reduced its stockpile of nuclear material.  Between now and this spring, we have a chance to negotiate a comprehensive agreement that prevents a nuclear-armed Iran; secures America and our allies — including Israel; while avoiding yet another Middle East conflict.There are no guarantees that negotiations will succeed, and I keep all options on the table to prevent a nuclear Iran.  But new sanctions passed by this Congress, at this moment in time, will all but guarantee that diplomacy fails — alienating America from its allies; and ensuring that Iran starts up its nuclear program again.  It doesn’t make sense.  That is why I will veto any new sanctions bill that threatens to undo this progress.  The American people expect us to only go to war as a last resort, and I intend to stay true to that wisdom.Third, we’re looking beyond the issues that have consumed us in the past to shape the coming century.No foreign nation, no hacker, should be able to shut down our networks, steal our trade secrets, or invade the privacy of American families, especially our kids.  We are making sure our government integrates intelligence to combat cyber threats, just as we have done to combat terrorism.  And tonight, I urge this Congress to finally pass the legislation we need to better meet the evolving threat of cyber-attacks, combat identity theft, and protect our children’s information.  If we don’t act, we’ll leave our nation and our economy vulnerable.  If we do, we can continue to protect the technologies that have unleashed untold opportunities for people around the globe.In West Africa, our troops, our scientists, our doctors, our nurses and healthcare workers are rolling back Ebola — saving countless lives and stopping the spread of disease.  I couldn’t be prouder of them, and I thank this Congress for your bipartisan support of their efforts.  But the job is not yet done — and the world needs to use this lesson to build a more effective global effort to prevent the spread of future pandemics, invest in smart development, and eradicate extreme poverty.In the Asia Pacific, we are modernizing alliances while making sure that other nations play by the rules — in how they trade, how they resolve maritime disputes, and how they participate in meeting common international challenges like nonproliferation and disaster relief.  And no challenge — no challenge — poses a greater threat to future generations than climate change.2014 was the planet’s warmest year on record.  Now, one year doesn’t make a trend, but this does — 14 of the 15 warmest years on record have all fallen in the first 15 years of this century.I’ve heard some folks try to dodge the evidence by saying they’re not scientists; that we don’t have enough information to act.  Well, I’m not a scientist, either.  But you know what — I know a lot of really good scientists at NASA, and NOAA, and at our major universities.  The best scientists in the world are all telling us that our activities are changing the climate, and if we do not act forcefully, we’ll continue to see rising oceans, longer, hotter heat waves, dangerous droughts and floods, and massive disruptions that can trigger greater migration, conflict, and hunger around the globe.  The Pentagon says that climate change poses immediate risks to our national security.  We should act like it.That’s why, over the past six years, we’ve done more than ever before to combat climate change, from the way we produce energy, to the way we use it.  That’s why we’ve set aside more public lands and waters than any administration in history.  And that’s why I will not let this Congress endanger the health of our children by turning back the clock on our efforts.  I am determined to make sure American leadership drives international action.  In Beijing, we made an historic announcement — the United States will double the pace at which we cut carbon pollution, and China committed, for the first time, to limiting their emissions.  And because the world’s two largest economies came together, other nations are now stepping up, and offering hope that, this year, the world will finally reach an agreement to protect the one planet we’ve got.There’s one last pillar to our leadership — and that’s the example of our values.As Americans, we respect human dignity, even when we’re threatened, which is why I’ve prohibited torture, and worked to make sure our use of new technology like drones is properly constrained.  It’s why we speak out against the deplorable anti-Semitism that has resurfaced in certain parts of the world.  It’s why we continue to reject offensive stereotypes of Muslims — the vast majority of whom share our commitment to peace.  That’s why we defend free speech, and advocate for political prisoners, and condemn the persecution of women, or religious minorities, or people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender.  We do these things not only because they’re right, but because they make us safer.As Americans, we have a profound commitment to justice — so it makes no sense to spend three million dollars per prisoner to keep open a prison that the world condemns and terrorists use to recruit.  Since I’ve been President, we’ve worked responsibly to cut the population of GTMO in half.  Now it’s time to finish the job.  And I will not relent in my determination to shut it down.  It’s not who we are.As Americans, we cherish our civil liberties — and we need to uphold that commitment if we want maximum cooperation from other countries and industry in our fight against terrorist networks.  So while some have moved on from the debates over our surveillance programs, I haven’t.  As promised, our intelligence agencies have worked hard, with the recommendations of privacy advocates, to increase transparency and build more safeguards against potential abuse.  And next month, we’ll issue a report on how we’re keeping our promise to keep our country safe while strengthening privacy.Looking to the future instead of the past.  Making sure we match our power with diplomacy, and use force wisely.  Building coalitions to meet new challenges and opportunities.  Leading — always — with the example of our values.  That’s what makes us exceptional.  That’s what keeps us strong.  And that’s why we must keep striving to hold ourselves to the highest of standards — our own.You know, just over a decade ago, I gave a speech in Boston where I said there wasn’t a liberal America, or a conservative America; a black America or a white America — but a United States of America.  I said this because I had seen it in my own life, in a nation that gave someone like me a chance; because I grew up in Hawaii, a melting pot of races and customs; because I made Illinois my home — a state of small towns, rich farmland, and one of the world’s great cities; a microcosm of the country where Democrats and Republicans and Independents, good people of every ethnicity and every faith, share certain bedrock values.Over the past six years, the pundits have pointed out more than once that my presidency hasn’t delivered on this vision.  How ironic, they say, that our politics seems more divided than ever.  It’s held up as proof not just of my own flaws — of which there are many — but also as proof that the vision itself is misguided, and naïve, and that there are too many people in this town who actually benefit from partisanship and gridlock for us to ever do anything about it.I know how tempting such cynicism may be.  But I still think the cynics are wrong.I still believe that we are one people.  I still believe that together, we can do great things, even when the odds are long.  I believe this because over and over in my six years in office, I have seen America at its best.  I’ve seen the hopeful faces of young graduates from New York to California; and our newest officers at West Point, Annapolis, Colorado Springs, and New London.  I’ve mourned with grieving families in Tucson and Newtown; in Boston, West, Texas, and West Virginia.  I’ve watched Americans beat back adversity from the Gulf Coast to the Great Plains; from Midwest assembly lines to the Mid-Atlantic seaboard.  I’ve seen something like gay marriage go from a wedge issue used to drive us apart to a story of freedom across our country, a civil right now legal in states that seven in ten Americans call home.  So I know the good, and optimistic, and big-hearted generosity of the American people who, every day, live the idea that we are our brother’s keeper, and our sister’s keeper.  And I know they expect those of us who serve here to set a better example.  So the question for those of us here tonight is how we, all of us, can better reflect America’s hopes.  I’ve served in Congress with many of you.  I know many of you well.  There are a lot of good people here, on both sides of the aisle.  And many of you have told me that this isn’t what you signed up for — arguing past each other on cable shows, the constant fundraising, always looking over your shoulder at how the base will react to every decision.Imagine if we broke out of these tired old patterns.  Imagine if we did something different.Understand — a better politics isn’t one where Democrats abandon their agenda or Republicans simply embrace mine.  A better politics is one where we appeal to each other’s basic decency instead of our basest fears.  A better politics is one where we debate without demonizing each other; where we talk issues, and values, and principles, and facts, rather than “gotcha” moments, or trivial gaffes, or fake controversies that have nothing to do with people’s daily lives.  A better politics is one where we spend less time drowning in dark money for ads that pull us into the gutter, and spend more time lifting young people up, with a sense of purpose and possibility, and asking them to join in the great mission of building America.If we’re going to have arguments, let’s have arguments — but let’s make them debates worthy of this body and worthy of this country.  We still may not agree on a woman’s right to choose, but surely we can agree it’s a good thing that teen pregnancies and abortions are nearing all-time lows, and that every woman should have access to the health care she needs.Yes, passions still fly on immigration, but surely we can all see something of ourselves in the striving young student, and agree that no one benefits when a hardworking mom is taken from her child, and that it’s possible to shape a law that upholds our tradition as a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants.We may go at it in campaign season, but surely we can agree that the right to vote is sacred; that it’s being denied to too many; and that, on this 50th anniversary of the great march from Selma to Montgomery and the passage of the Voting Rights Act, we can come together, Democrats and Republicans, to make voting easier for every single American.We may have different takes on the events of Ferguson and New York.  But surely we can understand a father who fears his son can’t walk home without being harassed.  Surely we can understand the wife who won’t rest until the police officer she married walks through the front door at the end of his shift.  Surely we can agree it’s a good thing that for the first time in 40 years, the crime rate and the incarceration rate have come down together, and use that as a starting point for Democrats and Republicans, community leaders and law enforcement, to reform America’s criminal justice system so that it protects and serves us all.That’s a better politics.  That’s how we start rebuilding trust.  That’s how we move this country forward.  That’s what the American people want.  That’s what they deserve.I have no more campaigns to run.  My only agenda for the next two years is the same as the one I’ve had since the day I swore an oath on the steps of this Capitol — to do what I believe is best for America.  If you share the broad vision I outlined tonight, join me in the work at hand.  If you disagree with parts of it, I hope you’ll at least work with me where you do agree.  And I commit to every Republican here tonight that I will not only seek out your ideas, I will seek to work with you to make this country stronger.Because I want this chamber, this city, to reflect the truth — that for all our blind spots and shortcomings, we are a people with the strength and generosity of spirit to bridge divides, to unite in common effort, and help our neighbors, whether down the street or on the other side of the world. I want our actions to tell every child, in every neighborhood:  your life matters, and we are as committed to improving your life chances as we are for our own kids.I want future generations to know that we are a people who see our differences as a great gift, that we are a people who value the dignity and worth of every citizen — man and woman, young and old, black and white, Latino and Asian, immigrant and Native American, gay and straight, Americans with mental illness or physical disability.  I want them to grow up in a country that shows the world what we still know to be true:  that we are still more than a collection of red states and blue states; that we are the United States of America.I want them to grow up in a country where a young mom like Rebekah can sit down and write a letter to her President with a story to sum up these past six years:  “It is amazing what you can bounce back from when you have to…we are a strong, tight-knit family who has made it through some very, very hard times.”My fellow Americans, we too are a strong, tight-knit family.  We, too, have made it through some hard times.  Fifteen years into this new century, we have picked ourselves up, dusted ourselves off, and begun again the work of remaking America.  We’ve laid a new foundation.  A brighter future is ours to write.  Let’s begin this new chapter — together — and let’s start the work right now. Thank you, God bless you, and God bless this country we love. ####

1763,EBAY,"After it spins off from eBay in 2015, PayPal will face a brace of challenges, three of which go by the names Apple, Alibaba and Google.Apple (AAPL) has entered mobile transactions with Apple Pay, a payment app that piggybacks on existing credit card and bank networks.China e-commerce leader Alibaba Group's (BABA) affiliated payments business Alipay plans to expand outside China and increasingly threatens PayPal in world markets.Google Wallet, Google's (GOOGL) payment service, looms as another competitor.Other rivals, including WePay and 2Checkout, also are nipping at PayPal's heels against a backdrop of fast-changing payments technologies.""Not only is PayPal going head-to-head with other mobile wallet providers such as ApplePay, Google Wallet, CurrentC and SoftCard, but the banks and their co-branded partners (retailers, airlines, hotels) are coming out with their own mobile apps that incorporate and create an advantage for their co-branded Visa (V) or MasterCard (MA) card,"" Phil Philliou, a former MasterCard executive and CEO of TruBeacon, told IBD.""The good news is that we are all chasing a multitrillion-transaction pool, and any percentage of it is meaningful,"" Philliou said. TruBeacon is developing mobile apps that incorporate Visa or MasterCard credit and debit cards directly into the app.Apple Pay uses a tap-to-pay technology in which iPhone owners touch or wave their devices at specially equipped store registers to transmit a secure digital ""token"" that represents — but doesn't carry — the customer's credit card account data. More than 20,000 U.S. stores already accept Apple Pay.Analysts say that Apple Pay's convenience, security and reach can undermine PayPal's efforts in mobile. PayPal's mobile tap-to-pay offerings are seen as limited compared with Apple Pay. And the eBay (EBAY) unit's plans to branch into offline point-of-sale transactions have fallen short, according to some analysts.Alipay boasts more than 300 million users in China and serves as the main payments platform for Alibaba's e-commerce websites Taobao and Tmall. Analysts estimate that Alibaba, which launched a U.S. website this year, has 75% to 80% of China's e-commerce market. PayPal, in comparison, has 157 million active users worldwide.So Alipay has more users, but PayPal has a far wider global footprint. It has ties with 15,000 financial institutions worldwide, is offered in 203 geographic markets and accepts payments for PayPal accounts in 26 currencies.PayPal's Q3 revenue jumped 20% year-over-year in Q3, powering eBay's 12% overall increase.Stifel Nicolaus analyst Scott Devitt said in a December research report that PayPal would continue to grab market share after its spinoff from eBay.Alibaba founder Jack Ma spun off Alipay from Alibaba in 2011 but controls Alipay through a stake in Alipay's holding company, Ant Financial Services Group.Ma said in a Nov. 11 interview with China's state TV network that Ant Financial ""will definitely go public,"" possibly in China.Pacific Crest Securities analyst Cheng Cheng said in a recent report that Alipay could expand beyond online payments into financial services such as wealth management and payroll services. Cheng values Ant Financial, whose main business is Alipay, at about $70 billion.Analysts say that Alipay can make inroads in global markets where PayPal's presence is still limited, such as Southeast Asia, South Asia, the Middle East and Africa.It's also possible that Alibaba will opt to cooperate rather than compete with PayPal in some markets. Alibaba Vice Chairman Joseph Tsai reportedly said last month that Alibaba would consider working with PayPal to expand its payment options for Chinese consumers. He said they would be interested in doing the same with Apple Pay.""If you look at (Alipay's) footprint of being the largest online payment company in China, and Pay Pal's position of having a very good international position not just in the U.S. but also in some other countries, these are some complementary footprints,"" Tsai told Bloomberg.

With more consumers browsing on the go, ""small businesses would be really wise to make mobile a huge focus of their effort,"" North said.The transaction process on smartphones can get clunky.""I'd be ruthless about perfecting the mobile experience,"" he said.• Spiff up. When competition is stiff, looks matter.

They say: 'This is where we came from,'"" Antonelli said.He asks: Does this represent who you are and where you want to go?• Be objective. ""I think it's difficult for many small businesses to look intrinsically at what their brand projects,"" Antonelli said. An objective opinion with a wider view informs. ""We look at who they're going up against.""• Find strength.  Positioning your firm as better than most? How about saying you're the very best?""Don't be an 'er.' Be an 'est,'"" said Olga Mizrahi, author of ""Sell Local, Think Global.""Find your unique value proposition. ""Large companies do this all the time,"" she said. ""Quite frankly, I want to know what your 'est' is, because that will get my attention.""• Listen in. Pay attention to online review sites like Yelp (YELP). ""They're really evergreen content,"" Mizrahi said, because comments stick around. Take time to claim your accounts on those review sites. Make sure your listings address, phone number and hours are correct. Then get involved in the dialogue on your terms.• Reach out.  Getting involved with a charitable cause gets your name out and builds connections — all while doing some good. ""I would love for every small business to align with a cause in their community,"" Mizrahi said.

1803,EBAY,"SolarWinds' acquisition spree isn't over.At its investor day on Nov. 12, the enterprise software maker told analysts that it's still hunting for deals to expand its product lines, customer base and presence overseas. SolarWinds' (SWI) most recent acquisitions include Pingdom, Confio and N-Able Technologies.With roots in network management software for corporate information technology specialists working in the trenches, SolarWinds has added products that help IT departments manage business applications, virtual servers in data centers and data storage systems.Customers of Sweden-based Pingdom, which makes software that monitors website performance, are said to include privately held Spotify, Microsoft (MSFT), Twitter (TWTR) and eBay (EBAY).SolarWinds has acquired a dozen companies since 2011. Its stock swooned in 2013 on worries about its efforts to integrate new companies into its business model amid higher investments and slowing growth of organic licensing revenue.Needs To DiversifyThis year, SolarWinds stock is up about 35% as it has reaped rewards from its deals. Its Q3 earnings beat Wall Street expectations while its Q4 outlook was in line.""SolarWinds has some positive momentum after some missteps last year. Street credibility is building, and it seems 2015 could be setting up for a solid year for the company,"" FBR Capital Markets analyst Daniel Ives told IBD.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters estimate that SolarWinds' 2015 net income will climb 16% to $159 million on revenue growth of 22% to $524 million.Steven Ashley, an analyst at Robert W. Baird, says that SolarWinds still has plenty of dry powder for acquisitions.Ashley adds that the company could spend more of the $195 million in cash on its balance sheet for acquisitions. SolarWinds' operating profit margins are in the low 40s. ""Forty cents of every $1 in revenue is free cash flow,"" Ashley said.Ashley expects SolarWinds to ""do some M&A, mostly of cloud-based software management technologies, as with the Pingdom acquisition.""Ives has a similar view.""Some tuck-in or strategic acquisitions could be on the horizon,"" Ives said. ""But I would be surprised to see anything of size. We could see cloud and next-generation data center as target areas.""SolarWinds still garners about 58% of its revenue from network management software. This revenue is expected to rise 14% to 17% in 2015.""The lion's share of revenue is still tied to their core networking DNA, but they have done a commendable job broadening out their product tentacles through organic strategies and M&A to attack the next-generation data center,"" Ives said.In 2013, SolarWinds acquired Boulder, Colo.-based Confio, a maker of database performance management software, for $103 million in cash.It also bought N-able for $120 million in cash. N-able's customers — managed service providers — cater to small businesses. Managed service providers are small shops that might start off fixing computers and networks for small businesses but often end up hosting and remotely managing operations for them.Rob Owens, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities, also expects more deal-making.""Analyst day commentary leads us to believe that more acquisitions will likely be the source of many new solutions,"" Owens said in a research report. ""While the top line is seeing some positive trends from added products, SolarWinds has spent the majority of its free cash flow in the past few years on acquisitions, and future cash flow generation is likely to be constrained by further investments.""Stockholm-based Pingdom, founded in 2007, might provide the most upside of recent deals, analysts say. Pingdom provides website performance monitoring software. It has 24,000 paying customers and 620,000 free users. Converting more of them to paying customers is key, says Owens.Expanded Cloud OfferingsSolarWinds' core strategy had been using social media to market products to IT engineers. SolarWinds has invested in cloud offerings but is still mainly focused on customer data centers. SolarWinds' main product, Orion communications network software, sells on average for $8,500 per license.Some of SolarWinds' earlier acquisitions include Tek-Tools for $42 million, DameWare for $40 million and TriGeo for $35 million. Tek-Tools makes storage and backup software. DameWare's software lets system administrators remotely manage computers on their networks. TriGeo's software lets engineers track usage of network devices such as routers and computer servers.SolarWinds also has expanded into Germany, Japan, Brazil and China.Keith Weiss, a Morgan Stanley analyst, has an equal-weight rating on the stock. He says that year-over-year financial comparisons will be easier as the pace of acquisitions slows.""With improved execution, new product in the portfolio and plenty of up-sell opportunity in the (customer) base, 2015 may be the year where SolarWinds fully returns to form in terms of top-line growth,"" Weiss said in a research report. ""Q4 likely represents an important (but tricky) quarter for investors to assess the core growth at SolarWinds, as ... (it) offers the first clean view into organic (software) license performance in several years.""

1804,EBAY,"Two international stocks with strong fundamentals are just below potential buy points in three-weeks-tight patterns.VistaPrint changed its name last week to Cimpress (CMPR) as it heads into the holiday season and the conclusion of the company's fiscal second quarter — typically its strongest money-earning time of the year.More than a decade ago, VistaPrint broke ground by enabling Internet users to design and order a variety of printed marketing materials such as brochures.Suddenly, individuals and small businesses had access to high-quality materials that had formerly required a designer and a print shop. A boon to small businesses, VistaPrint's typical customer had fewer than 10 employees.Initially incorporated in Bermuda, VistaPrint shifted its place of incorporation to the Netherlands in 2009. That year, the company drew 39% of its revenue from overseas. Overseas revenue rose to 45% of its total in the fiscal year ended in June.The name change to Cimpress coincides with an effort to shift toward higher-spending, or higher ""lifetime value,"" customers.Fiscal first-quarter results, reported on Oct. 30, reflected the shift. An 87% jump in earnings topped expectations, and the 21% revenue growth met forecasts. Cimpress reported growth across all regions. It also reported a slight decline in overall users but a larger order size during the quarter.The company lowered the midpoint of its fiscal-year revenue guidance by $40 million but reported that its foreign exposure was entirely hedged. Analysts project a 27% increase in earnings in the current fiscal year.The stock cleared a deep, 11-month consolidation Oct. 30 after the earnings report. It then formed a three-weeks-tight pattern with a 69.10 buy point. The stock has fallen below the pattern but still has a chance to clear that secondary entry.Further south, Argentina-based MercadoLibre (MELI) shaped a three-weeks-tight pattern with a buy point of 144.33. The chart may also be viewed as a large cup with handle. Either way, the buy point is the same.The online auction and retail marketplace, a smaller approximation of an Amazon.com (AMZN) or an eBay (EBAY), sees the bulk of its revenue from Brazil, Argentina and Venezuela.Analysts forecast a 98% increase in EPS in 2015.

1805,EBAY,"OpenStack could soon be the software that runs the non-Amazon cloud.Open-source software available for free, OpenStack helps corporate IT departments manage data centers packed with computer servers.OpenStack has also gained popularity as a tool to connect data centers to public clouds, where computing resources are shared via the Internet.But Amazon.com's (AMZN) Amazon Web Services (AWS) is by far the biggest provider of infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS). And it uses its own software, not OpenStack.Still, OpenStack has gained popularity among enterprises that want to use multiple cloud platforms.For investors, the question is: which companies will gain the most from OpenStack's rise as a cloud operating system?""There's a big roster of household name IT vendors that are backing OpenStack — Intel (INTC), IBM (IBM), Cisco Systems (CSCO), Dell and HP (HPQ) — a lot of companies have placed a bet,"" said Al Sadowski, an analyst at 451 Research.Worries over whether OpenStack could handle large business workloads have eased. So OpenStack seems primed for wide adoption, though there are open-source rivals such as Citrix Systems' (CTXS) CloudStack, points out James Staten, a Forrester Research analyst.""The concerns now are less about the platform itself and who is influencing its development,"" Staten told IBD. ""The concerns instead are about who takes OpenStack successfully to market and begins to lead through market power. That's a key theme worth watching in 2015.""Rackspace, NASA DevelopedRackspace Hosting (RAX) and government space agency NASA co-developed OpenStack in 2010, aiming to make the software a cloud computing standard. Rackspace's main business has been hosting websites. Rackspace stepped up investments in OpenStack in 2012 and 2013, but its revenue growth slowed as companies lingered in testing OpenStack's capabilities.Rackspace now supports multiple cloud platforms and has become less dependent on OpenStack near term.""While Rackspace continues to develop solutions on the OpenStack platform, management is providing managed cloud solutions across multiple technologies,"" wrote James Breen, a William Blair analyst, in a research report last month.The OpenStack ecosystem is growing, says 451 Research. The market research firm says that OpenStack-related revenue will rise to $3.49 billion in 2018 from $890 million in 2014.""All OpenStack needs to do is get to the same reliability and resiliency as the computing platforms it's replacing,"" Sadowski said. ""It's clear, though, that OpenStack is gaining mindshare and marketing power.""Early backers hoped that OpenStack would slow the march of AWS. Oppenheimer analyst Tim Horan estimates that AWS revenue will jump 40% to roughly $5 billion in 2015. Even so, ""OpenStack is starting to mature as enterprises shift legacy IT workloads to cloud environments,"" Horan said.Expedia (EXPE), Walt Disney (DIS), Time Warner Cable (TWC), Wells Fargo (WFC) and BMW are among recent OpenStack adopters, says 451 Research. Earlier users included eBay's (EBAY) PayPal, Best Buy (BBY) and Fidelity Investments.To attract corporate customers, OpenStack supporters positioned the open-source software as an alternative to VMware 's (VMW) software, widely used in data centers to make servers more efficient.Red Hat (RHT), the leading provider of Linux open-source server software and a VMware rival, has lined up behind OpenStack.But pushing its own cloud platform is still VMware's top priority, analysts say. With partners such as the privately held Mirantis, VMware sells software that helps its customers use OpenStack for building so-called ""private"" cloud data centers that are accessible by branch offices, clients and others.Analysts say that most enterprises are interested in a public-private hybrid cloud model — running the most important business apps on their own servers behind a private corporate firewall and accessing public IaaS providers as needed.Many tech vendors are focused on providing tools for hybrid clouds. Rackspace aims to provide managed services in the hybrid cloud market rather than struggle vs. much bigger IaaS firms AWS, Microsoft (MSFT) and Google (GOOGL).Positioned As Cloud Concierge""Rackspace continues to remain technology agnostic even as the company's OpenStack is increasingly attractive as a platform for public cloud,"" said Barclays analyst Sandeep Gupta in a report. ""As AWS, Microsoft and Google continue to put pressure on pricing, we wouldn't be surprised if Rackspace positions itself as a cloud concierge to a hybrid cloud environment.""Many tech suppliers aim to use OpenStack to bridge private and public clouds.""The strong leaders in OpenStack today are a mix. Hewlett-Packard and Red Hat are clearly strong voices in the community, as is SuSE, Mirantis, Internap (INAP) and arguably Cisco Systems due to their recent moves,"" said Forrester's Staten. ""Rackspace still has a strong voice, IBM to a lesser degree, as they are really only focusing on it for their private cloud initiatives.""IBM last year acquired cloud-service firm SoftLayer for $2 billion. HP has said that it'll spend $1 billion over the next two years on products and services around OpenStack.451 Research says that Europe-based OVH and startup Blue Box have gained traction with OpenStack customers. Some companies are using acquisitions to gain a foothold in cloud computing services and OpenStack. EMC (EMC), another cloud company, acquired Cloudscaling in October, Cisco bought Metacloud in September and Red Hat purchased eNovance in June.Lydia Leong, an analyst with research firm Gartner, agrees that OpenStack has gained momentum. The OpenStack Foundation, with more than 430 members, has regularly rolled out improved versions of the software.""OpenStack is gaining more traction than it had before as the product starts to become more useable,"" Leong told IBD. ""The primary beneficiaries are those that sell (software) distributions, such as Red Hat, HP and Mirantis.""

1820,EBAY,"Some prognosticators play it safe with year-ahead predictions. They'll build their forecasts off known events like product launches (Apple Watch, Windows 10, etc.) or extrapolate from current trends (cloud computing, Internet of Things, etc.).But others are much more daring. Like Babe Ruth confidently pointing to the center-field bleachers and swinging for a home run, these forecasters are willing to take a gamble and risk striking out big time.What follows are 10 of the boldest predictions for the tech industry in 2015.1. Twitter gets sold, possibly to GoogleShort-message social network Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) had a rough time in 2014. The microblogging service went public on Nov. 7, 2013, at 26 and ended that year at 63.65. Twitter stock fell 44% in 2014, closing Wednesday at 35.87. The San Francisco-based firm has struggled to grow its active user base and advertising revenue. Some on Wall Street have called for CEO Dick Costolo's head.Chris Ciaccia, technology editor of TheStreet, says Twitter will get bought out in 2015.""Don't be shocked to see Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) come knocking if Twitter's market cap drops below $20 billion,"" he wrote. It ended 2014 with a market cap of $22.4 billion.2. A major Web player buys NetflixCCS Insight, a U.K.-based technology research firm, thinks subscription streaming video firm Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) will be acquired by a major Web company in 2015.""All Web players are looking for a stronger presence in paid-for video, something Netflix has achieved with remarkable success . .. Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO), Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) and Google are potential suitors,"" CCS said in a report. If Google doesn't buy Netflix, it will launch its own video streaming service in 2015, CCS predicted.On a similar note, Strategy Analytics analyst Michael Goodman predicted Google and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) each will launch subscription video-on-demand services in the new year. He suggested that either of those two could step up and buy Hulu to accelerate their efforts.3. Google buys PayPalEBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) is scheduled to spin off its PayPal unit in 2015. But Bob Pisani, CNBC ""On-Air Stocks"" editor, doesn't think that will happen. Instead, Google will buy PayPal and combine it with Google Wallet to take on Apple Pay in the emerging mobile payments market, he said.Cash-rich search giant Google is a common theme in big acquisition predictions.CCS even predicts that Google will buy action-camera maker GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO) in 2015.4. Qualcomm acquires AMD for its IPWireless chip firm Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) might buy struggling PC and graphics chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) just to get its intellectual property to fend off Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), tech journalist Andy Patrizio said in Network World.CCS predicts Qualcomm will gobble up activity-band maker Fitbit in 2015.5. Red Hat buys ClouderaLarry Dignan, editor-in-chief of ZDNet, predicted that Red Hat (NYSE:RHT) will buy IPO candidate Cloudera in 2015.""Red Hat buys Cloudera in a move that solidifies its position in analytics,"" he said. ""Culturally, the two open-source companies could mesh well. From an art of war perspective, Red Hat's acquisition plays keep away from Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), IBM (NYSE:IBM) and a long list of other interested parties.""Dignan also predicted that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) will spin off its Amazon Web Services cloud computing business and that data-storage firm EMC (NYSE:EMC) will merge with Hewlett-Packard's (NYSE:HPQ) enterprise business.6. At least one major 3D printer maker gets acquiredBrian Krassenstein, co-founder and editor-in-chief at 3DPrint.com, predicted that one or more of the following publicly traded 3D printer companies will be acquired by a larger corporation before the end of 2015: 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD), Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS), ExOne (NASDAQ:XONE), Voxeljet (NYSE:VJET) or Organovo (AMEX:ONVO).7. Cisco's John Chambers steps downJohn Chambers has been CEO at Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) since January 1995, when he was 46 years old. Now 65, and after 20 years at the helm of the networking company, it might be time for Chambers to retire. Of course, that's been rumored for years, as Fortune noted in September.""I thought last year would be the year that Cisco CEO John Chambers stepped down, paving the way for his replacement,"" TheStreet's Ciaccia said. ""As it turns out, I was wrong, but that's not going to stop me from making another prediction for this year.""8. VMware acquires ServiceNowEMC finally will spin off VMware (NYSE:VMW) in 2015, Elias Khnaser, chief technology officer at Sigma Solutions, predicted. VMware will then go on a buying spree, most notably picking up ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW), he said.""One of the most important goals of this spree will be to beef up vCloud Air and fend off both Microsoft and Amazon, which won't be easy to do,"" Khnaser said. ""I predict that in order for VMware to capture and enhance its private and hybrid cloud, it will acquire ServiceNow. Service management is a key component of any private cloud, and with ServiceNow's dominant market share, extensive platform and the potential to capture significant services engagement and enhance its own tools, it's the perfect acquisition target to cement VMware's place in the hybrid cloud game.""9. We'll witness the rise of ElloSick of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) for its advertising and spotty privacy record, many social networking users will switch to upstart Ello, predicted Jayson DeMers, founder of AudienceBloom.""The platform, which is still in public beta (meaning invite-only), has caused quite a stir,"" DeMers said. ""Dubbed by some as the 'hipster social network,' Ello offers a forever ad-free experience and promises to never sell its users' information to third parties.""Ello will grow in both user numbers and engagement in 2015, he said.10. Zynga brand disappearsEach year, 24/7 Wall St. identifies 10 American brands that it predicts will disappear before the end of the next year.

Alibaba's affiliated Alipay payments service competes with both PayPal and Apple. ""If you look at our footprint of being…
"
1832,EBAY,"Starbucks customers are a loyal bunch — loyal enough to protest the departure of their beloved eggnog latte, prompting the coffee chain to revive the seasonal favorite, and loyal enough to make the company the No. 1 most-expensed restaurant for business travelers.
"
1833,EBAY,"But would they be loyal enough to someday use a Starbucks (SBUX)-brand mobile payment system outside its coffeehouses instead of Apple (AAPL) Pay?
"
1834,EBAY,"Apple may have been able to boast 1 million sign-ups for its e-payment service within three days of launching, but the java giant has long been sitting on an impressive database of coffee lovers — and their credit card information — with its mobile app.
"
1835,EBAY,"Starbucks would join an increasingly competitive field, which includes Google (GOOGL) Wallet, eBay's (EBAY) soon-to-be-spun-off PayPal and CurrentC, a system backed by retail giants like CVS Health (CVS), Rite Aid (RAD) and Wal-Mart (WMT) and set to roll out next year.
"
1836,EBAY,"Of the 7 million weekly transactions that take place at Starbucks registers, 16% are made from a mobile device, CEO Howard Schultz said last month in an earnings call, during which he claimed Starbucks had nabbed nine-tenths of the $1.3 billion mobile payment market last year.
"
1837,EBAY,"""What they're doing with mobile pay is revolutionary, in my opinion,"" Wedbush Securities analyst Nick Setyan told IBD. ""Ninety percent of mobile pay in the U.S. takes place at Starbucks locations. That's a testament to how far ahead of everyone else they are.""
"
1838,EBAY,"And Schultz has hinted that a stand-alone e-payment system may be on the horizon.
"
1839,EBAY,"Starbucks had ""cracked the code"" at connecting mobile payments to customer loyalty, he said during the call.
"
1840,EBAY,"""(W)e are now receiving great interest in partnerships from mobile payment companies who see the value of our rewards program and the mobile payment behavior we established,"" he said, adding that the company would be cautious in choosing partners and how it moves forward.
"
1841,EBAY,"""But I can assure you that Starbucks will have a major role to play, both inside and outside of our stores as the nascent mobile payment industry evolves.""
"
1842,EBAY,"While no definitive details are out, the move wouldn't be a complete surprise to some, given Starbucks' acquisition of Evolution Fresh, launch of Evolution Fresh bars and trail mix, and purchase of the La Boulange bakery chain.
"
1843,EBAY,"""If you look at what Starbucks has been doing the past five years, one thing becomes clear: It wants to control its own destiny and own its ecosystem,"" said Belus Capital Advisors' Brian Sozzi via email.
"
1844,EBAY,"When asked if the coffee chain could give the tech behemoth a run for its money, he replied: ""Yes, indeed. Starbucks has become our daily habit, something we constantly think about ... almost as much as using our iPhone.""
"
1845,EBAY,"Not A 'Reasonable Investment'
"
1846,EBAY,"Yet creating an Apple Pay-like system from the ground up would be a different beast than simply connecting rewards accounts to credit cards, and instead would involve banks and plenty of compliance hoops to jump through.
"
1847,EBAY,"""To develop a stand-alone payment system is. . . not a reasonable investment"" on Starbucks' part, said analyst Setyan, who said the only benefit would be lower transaction-processing costs. Taking it to the mainstream would be a ""big, big, big process.
"
1848,EBAY,"""From my point of view, I just think it's not the best use of their time,"" he said.
"
1849,EBAY,"Wedbush Securities' Gil Luria agrees. While he also called mobile order-and-pay ""a revolutionary step,"" he was less optimistic about the idea of a stand-alone system, calling it an ""uphill battle"" and questioning why issuers and banks would want to cut the coffee chain in on the action.
"
1850,EBAY,"And consumers?
"
1851,EBAY,"""Just because they want to use a Starbucks card at Starbucks doesn't mean they want to use a Starbucks card anywhere else,"" he said.
"
1852,EBAY,"Siren Song
"
1853,EBAY,"But those skeptical of the green mermaid's devotees should also keep in mind that her siren song has made consumers do crazier things than sign up for an e-pay service. Starbucks memorably sold all 1,000 of its $450 rose-gold metal gift cards within minutes last year, and may very well sell out again with this season's $110 Swarovski-studded tumblers and $200 sterling silver cards — which notably only come loaded with $50.
"
1854,EBAY,"In the meantime, Starbucks is keeping customers caffeinated with order-ahead and delivery pilot programs in a digital push that's more about e-commerce than coffee.
"
1855,EBAY,"Starbucks' mobile order-and-pay service launches in Portland in December, allowing customers to order their Venti mochas and Grande Fizzios by smartphone and pick them up in stores. It will expand nationwide next year.
"
1856,EBAY,"""Going forward, what they're doing with mobile order-and-pay should give them a leg up,"" said Wedbush's Setyan, noting in an Oct. 31 report that he sees order-and-pay and the delivery pilot as ""potential game changers in FY15.""
"
1857,EBAY,"The order-ahead program could also help streamline in-store foot traffic as the company expands its food and drink selection to items like wine and tapas-style plates in select cities. Sozzi thinks mobile pay and deliveries could ease pressure on lines as Starbucks' menu gets larger and more complex.
"
1858,EBAY,"With more purchases moving online, CEO Schultz has made clear his concerns about a ""seismic shift in consumer behavior."" His answer to that appears to be a delivery program in certain markets in the latter half of 2015.
"
1859,EBAY,"""Imagine the ability to create a standing order of Starbucks delivered, hot or iced, to your desk daily. That's our version of e-commerce on steroids,"" said Schultz during the call.
"
1860,EBAY,"Of course, there are plenty of potential obstacles involved with delivery, including quality control — how well will that latte survive a cross-town trip in the dead of winter? — and the resources and manpower involved in rolling out such an ambitious undertaking.
"
1861,EBAY,"""It's very early days at this, but we are moving ahead — full steam ahead,"" said Starbucks Global Chief Strategy Officer Matt Ryan during the call. ""The pilots are coming soon.""
"
1862,EBAY,"The company said capital expenditures will be ""somewhat higher"" at $1.4 billion for fiscal 2015 as it invests more in the mobile order-and-pay program, store growth and evening stores.

1863,EBAY,"Analysts don't seem concerned.

"
1873,EBAY,"Avago's Q4 results and Q1 guidance beat analyst views this month, largely on the popularity of the iPhone 6. The company, whose shares have soared 91% since the beginning of the year, has grown EPS and sales for six consecutive quarters.
"
1874,EBAY,"Avago shares consolidated below their 50-day moving average from September through November, but they have since resurfaced well above the key measurement. The stock reached an all-time high of 105.00 intraday on Dec. 5 but edged down to 100.72 on Wednesday.

1887,EBAY,"Research firm IPO Boutique said that its channel checks reveal, according to underwriter guidance, that the Alibaba Group IPO has ""absolutely overwhelming demand.""The demand suggests that the stock will likely price near, or above, the high end of the already increased range of 66-68.Alibaba (BABA) is slated to price its shares late Thursday and begin trading Friday on the NYSE under the BABA ticker. It is positioned to set an IPO record, selling 320.1 million shares.If the stock prices at 68, the IPO would raise $21.76 billion. That's just short of the $22.1 billion raised in the 2010 IPO of Agricultural Bank of China.But if underwriters exercise an option to sell an additional 49 million shares to meet demand, as now seems likely, then Alibaba would raise $24.3 billion and become the new leader.The Alibaba IPO is already assured to beat the largest U.S. IPOs: Visa (V) at $19.7 billion and the largest tech IPO, Facebook (FB), at $16 billion.If Alibaba prices at the midpoint of its current range, it would have a market value of $155 billion. That would exceed Amazon.com (AMZN) but lag Facebook and Google (GOOGL).The hype over Alibaba stems for it being the largest provider of e-commerce services in the country with the most Internet users, and half of China's population hasn't even made it onto the Internet yet.For the 12 months ended June 30, Alibaba processed $296 billion in gross merchandise volume — more than Amazon and eBay (EBAY) combined. Alibaba has more than 279 million active buyers and 8.5 million sellers on its three main e-commerce sites.Its chief rival in China, though not a major competitor for now, is Tencent Holdings (TCEHY). While Alibaba dominates in e-commerce, Tencent dominates in social media and messaging.But both companies have created joint ventures with other China Internet firms, going after each other in their respective markets.Follow Brian Deagon on Twitter @IBD_BDeagon.RELATED:Alibaba Set For World's Top IPO As China Giant PrepsHow Will Alibaba Match Up Vs.

"
1890,EBAY,"The initial public offering raised $21.8 billion, making it the largest-ever U.S. IPO and giving it a market valuation of $168 billion — above Amazon (AMZN) but below Google and Facebook. Alibaba stock will begin trading on the NYSE Friday morning

1891,EBAY,"If the underwriters exercise an option to sell an additional 49 million shares, as seems likely given the strong demand, Alibaba (BABA) would raise $24.3 billion and replace the 2010 IPO of Agricultural Bank of China as the world's largest ever. The biggest U.S. IPO previously was the $19.7 billion raised by Visa (V). The largest tech IPO, Facebook (FB), raised $16 billion.
"
1892,EBAY,"Alibaba initially revealed IPO plans on May 6, setting off a continuous drumbeat of media reports at a level not seen since the IPOs of Google (GOOGL) in 2004 and Facebook in 2012, if not more so.
"
1893,EBAY,"Worthy Of Expectations?
"
1894,EBAY,"The hype over Alibaba stems from it being the largest provider of e-commerce services, by a large margin, in a country with the most Internet users globally even though the population is only half penetrated by the web.
"
1895,EBAY,"""There has been a lot of hype of the magnitude we saw in 1999-2000 and everyone is excited about it,"" said John Fitzgibbon, principal at IPOscoop.com. ""But Alibaba is a real company with actual revenue and it's profitable.""
"
1896,EBAY,"For the year ended March 31, Alibaba reported revenue of $8.46 billion, up 52% from the prior year. It reported EPS of $1.61, up 180%. It processed $296 billion in gross merchandise volume, which was more than Amazon and eBay combined, for the 12-months ended June 30. It has more than 279 million active buyers and 8.5 million sellers on its three main e-commerce sites.
"
1897,EBAY,"Early Thursday, research firm IPO Boutique said its channel checks revealed Alibaba's IPO had ""absolutely overwhelming demand."" Its sources indicated as few as the top 50 institutional accounts could get upwards of 80% of the IPO. By focusing the allocation so narrowly to large institutions, the intent is to prevent volatile trading of the stock in the weeks to come, it said.
"
1898,EBAY,"A report by Morningstar on Wednesday assigned a ""fair value estimate"" on Alibaba of 90 per share, based on revenue growing at a compound annual rate of 32% and operating margins expanding to 50.2% from 47.5% over the next five years.

1900,EBAY,"""Perhaps learning lessons from Facebook's IPO, Alibaba's current pricing range strikes us as conservative, and we do not believe the valuation fully reflects the features that make the Alibaba investment story unique,"" according to Morningstar analysts R.J. Hottovy on Wednesday.
"
1901,EBAY,"""We believe the IPO is most appropriate for investors with higher risk tolerance looking to increase their exposure to China's emerging middle-class consumer base and its online commerce, mobile commerce, technology, and logistics industries.""
"
1902,EBAY,"Though the IPO raised $21.8 billion in total proceeds, the amount going to Alibaba will be closer to $8.2 billion. About 62% of shares were sold by insiders, from whom Alibaba will not get any IPO money.
"
1903,EBAY,"SoftBank, the largest shareholder with a 34.4% stake, had no plans to sell shares. Yahoo (YHOO), with a 22.4% stake, was expected to sell 140 million shares, about 26% of its total stake.
"
1904,EBAY,"Alibaba was vague about how it planned to use its proceeds, citing just ""general corporate purposes.""
"
1905,EBAY,"But company founder and Executive Chairman Jack Ma has made clear his plans to be a global company, with eyes on the U.S. and Europe. Alibaba has made multiple investments in U.S. Internet companies starting in 2010, including e-commerce firms that would compete with Amazon and eBay (EBAY).

It has more than 279 million active buyers and 8.5 million sellers on its three main e-commerce sites.Early Thursday, research firm IPO Boutique said its channel checks revealed Alibaba's IPO had ""absolutely overwhelming demand."" Its sources indicated as few as the top 50 institutional accounts could get upwards of 80% of the IPO. By focusing the allocation so narrowly to large institutions, the intent is to prevent volatile trading of the stock in the weeks to come, it said.A report by Morningstar on Wednesday assigned a ""fair value estimate"" on Alibaba of 90 per share, based on revenue growing at a compound annual rate of 32% and operating margins expanding to 50.2% from 47.5% over the next five years.IPO Price Seen As Cautious""Perhaps learning lessons from Facebook's IPO, Alibaba's current pricing range strikes us as conservative, and we do not believe the valuation fully reflects the features that make the Alibaba investment story unique,"" according to Morningstar analysts R.J. Hottovy on Wednesday.""We believe the IPO is most appropriate for investors with higher risk tolerance looking to increase their exposure to China's emerging middle-class consumer base and its online commerce, mobile commerce, technology, and logistics industries.""Though the IPO raised $21.8 billion in total proceeds, the amount going to Alibaba will be closer to $8.2 billion. About 62% of shares were sold by insiders, from whom Alibaba will not get any IPO money.SoftBank, the largest shareholder with a 34.4% stake, had no plans to sell shares. Yahoo (YHOO), with a 22.4% stake, was expected to sell 140 million shares, about 26% of its total stake.Alibaba was vague about how it planned to use its proceeds, citing just ""general corporate purposes.""But company founder and Executive Chairman Jack Ma has made clear his plans to be a global company, with eyes on the U.S. and Europe. Alibaba has made multiple investments in U.S. Internet companies starting in 2010, including e-commerce firms that would compete with Amazon and eBay (EBAY).Alibaba still faces a formidable rival in China in Tencent Holdings (TCEHY), which dominates social media and messaging.

Now they're increasingly writing policies for another worry — cyberattacks.One of the many changes brought by the Internet revolution is that stealing customer data or a company's proprietary information is easier than ever. One doesn't even need to be on the same continent anymore to commit the theft. And it can be weeks or even months before the damage is even detected.In response, insurers are selling more cyberpolicies . Coverage may include loss or corruption of business data, lost business activity, legal defense costs, the cost of posting cash rewards to catch cybercriminals, crisis communications management, identity theft and defamation via social media.While these hazards can be difficult to underwrite, insurers have had years to refine their products.""It's probably the fastest-growing aspect of the insurance market right now,"" said Bob Parisi, leader of network security and private practice for insurance broker and risk adviser Marsh USA.

2226,EBAY,"To make vital information pop out in the widening ocean of Big Data, organizations must adopt the right tools and mindset. So says Phil Simon, author of  ""The Visual Organization."" He quotes Henry David Thoreau to make his point: ""It's not what you look at that matters; it's what you see.""Tips on making key info relevant:• Embrace tech. Business leaders must use interactive applications that highlight crucial discoveries. Pie charts can still tell a story, said Simon, but the best organizations ""understand that contemporary data-visualization tools allow for a high degree of interactivity, motion and animation.""Technology can lead to unexpected statistical conclusions. ""If at all possible, try to create data visualizations with embedded interactivity,"" Simon told IBD. ""These types of tools allow end users to easily and quickly ask and answer questions. In the end, better business decisions are likely to result.""• See all numbers. Don't neglect small data such as lists of sales, customers, employees and products internally and in presentations.• Exercise patience. With more sources of information than ever and more ways to analyze it, decoding data can seem overwhelming, said Bill Franks, author of  ""Taming the Big Data Tidal Wave.""""The potential is so large that organizations must push through the initial learning curve,"" said Franks, who is also chief analytics officer for software giant Teradata (TDC) . ""It has always taken time to integrate new data and new analytics into business processes.""So begin, experiment and shape the data to your firm's needs.• Start small. Some organizations make the mistake of building huge systems to gather masses of data before they get started, says Franks .""Capture just enough to prove or disprove what you're trying to do,"" he suggested. ""Once proved, move forward with the bigger effort.""For example, Franks says, you don't need all Web browsing history for all customers for a year to test how the data can improve marketing offers. You need a solid sample of just a few months.• Understand the stakes. Franks contends that you won't find an example where more information made analytics less powerful. ""Some of the highest market-cap companies in the world today, especially in Silicon Valley, have built their business around analytics,"" he said. ""It is possible for traditional organizations to make the transition and become an analytic organization that fully leverages Big Data.""Simon points to companies such as eBay (EBAY), Netflix (NFLX), Autodesk (ADSK), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB) and Google (GOOGL) embracing visual-data expertise. His take: ""Google in 2014 can do things that in 1998 it couldn't even imagine. In 2018, Google will do things that it can't do today. Recognize that it's a journey, not a sprint.""• Go beyond. Big Data and visualization expand the possible. ""Organizations must re-examine longstanding policies and assumptions about what can be done,"" Franks said. ""It is quite possible that analytics or actions that were not realistic to pursue even a few years ago could be very achievable today.""• Be open. Not everyone has to be a numbers scientist. ""Still,"" said Simon, ""it behooves organizations to remember this quote from Silicon Valley icon Jim Barksdale: 'If we have data, let's look at (them). If all we have are opinions, let's go with mine.'""

2254,EBAY,"Apple (AAPL) could be building closer ties to credit-card companies Visa (V), MasterCard (MA), and American Express (AXP) as it readies a move into the mobile payments market with the iPhone 6 launch. Apple's move challenges both e-Bay's (EBAY) PayPal and retail consortium MCX, Morgan Stanley says in a report.Banks, credit-card networks, wireless phone companies and Web giants such as Google (GOOGL) aim to win over consumers to ""digital wallet"" payment systems built into mobile phones. Apple's ace in the hole — a database of some 600 million worldwide iTunes users with credit card accounts — will immediately make it a formidable player, analysts say.MCX — a group of some 60 merchants led by Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) — hope to do away with the credit card transaction fees they pay to American Express, Visa and MasterCard, analysts say. MCX is expected to use an automated clearinghouse system set up by a coalition of banks to debit bank accounts or credit lines.Apple, expected to release the iPhone 6 this year, may view the credit card networks as potential allies, says Smittipon Srethapramote, a Morgan Stanley analyst. He suggests that the iPhone 6 will feature cloud-based technology to help consumers use existing credit-card accounts.The technology and business blog StarPoint speculates that Apple may use ""token authentication"" in the iPhone 6.Visa and MasterCard have endorsed HCE, or host-card emulation, which stores users' payment information in the cloud rather than in a mobile phone's hardware. Phone companies AT&T (T) and Verizon Communications (VZ) have pushed a method for storing digital IDs within the SIM (subscriber identity module) card in handsets.Apple's approach may be less threatening to established industry players, Srethapramote says. Recent reports indicate that Apple could use NFC (near-field communications) in the iPhone 6, he explains. NFC is a short-range, wireless communications technology that connects smartphones with payment readers.""Several news sites (including NFC World) have cited sources that Apple was working with China UnionPay to include an NFC payment application from the latter in Passbook,"" Srethapramote said.

"

"
2330,EBAY,"Teens have cooled on apparel as their spending on Apple (AAPL) iPhones and other tech-related gear and accessories become more important status symbols.
"
2331,EBAY,"""Teens would rather outfit their cellphones than outfit their own bodies,"" said Marshal Cohen, chief industry analyst at the NPD Group.
"
2332,EBAY,"Young adults have little money to spend: Unemployment among those age 16-19 is still 19.1%. Parents are struggling with poor employment and wages.
"
2333,EBAY,"And there are just too many stores chasing too few teens.
"
2334,EBAY,"""Specialty teen retailing remains at overcapacity domestically with growth continuing to outpace the teen population,"" according to a 2014 Piper Jaffray survey of 7,500 teens at an average age of 16.4 years.
"
2335,EBAY,"From 1999 to 2007, the industry grew at a 39% compound annual growth rate, while the teen population grew at a low single-digit rate, says the survey. Over the last five years, the teen population has contracted while teen-retail square footage has expanded at a low single-digit rate per year.
"
2336,EBAY,"For all these reasons, teen retailers have significantly underperformed other merchants since the start of last year, says Perkins. In Q1, the segment reported an earnings decline of 130% — an outright loss — vs. an estimated 4.2% drop for the industry as a whole. Analysts see another loss for the teen apparel group in the current quarter.
"
2337,EBAY,"Limited spending power has prompted teens to ""migrate"" to the fast-fashion chains where they get more bang for their buck than they do at the teen apparel stores, adds Brain Sozzi, CEO of Belus Capital Advisors.
"
2338,EBAY,"Cheap Chic
"
2339,EBAY,"""These fast-fashion companies have done a phenomenal job undercutting all the traditional mall retailers on price, and they're giving teens an assortment that can't be found anywhere in the mall,"" said Sozzi.
"
2340,EBAY,"""If these stores can offer something like a pair of jeans for about 50% less than at, say, American Eagle, the teen is willing to have lower-quality merchandise as long as the assortment looks fashionable from 10 yards away.""
"
2341,EBAY,"Fast-fashion chains turn over merchandise quickly and offer teens new floor sets weekly to create buzz and excitement.
"
2342,EBAY,"The chains turn their merchandise in weeks, and in other instances it's months.
"
2343,EBAY,"The traditional teen retailer requires a longer lead time of six to nine months and typically rolls over merchandise a couple of times a season, Perkins adds.
"
2344,EBAY,"How do the fast-fashion retailers produce so quickly? They have ""massive supply chain infrastructure,"" says Kernan. They also ""tend to buy millions of yards of fabric far in advance of production"" since they don't know what style or fit they'll need.
"
2345,EBAY,"The factories ""in turn are fed consistent business and orders"" from these retailers, he adds.
"
2346,EBAY,"Accessorizing Trend
"
2347,EBAY,"Cohen says there's been a lack of fashion innovation in the teen space, which has created a ""void.""
"
2348,EBAY,"""The categories that were driving teen spending growth in the past are not growing,"" he said. ""They're trading down and spending on accessories rather than clothing.""
"
2349,EBAY,"They're buying less-expensive things like leggings instead of jeans and tights instead of pants.
"
2350,EBAY,"It's all about ""accessorizing,"" be it in fashions or their electronics, Cohen says.
"
2351,EBAY,"""There's been a shift in fashion preference away from uniform dressing where logos were more important toward mix and match and personal style,"" said Citi Research analyst Oliver Chen.
"
2352,EBAY,"And with a lack of any ""dominant"" fashion trend, multiple trends are working, he adds.
"
2353,EBAY,"Teens are dressing with different brands and mixing high-end and low-end items rather than wearing one brand ""head to toe,"" he says.
"
2354,EBAY,"What do teen retailers have to do to lure their customers back?
"
2355,EBAY,"""They need to focus on executing on trend-right products, and they need to rationalize their store bases,"" said Chen.
"
2356,EBAY,"They also need to ""reinvent their brands to stay relevant,"" he adds.
"
2357,EBAY,"Bringing merchandise into stores more quickly to ""generate buzz"" and become more competitive with the fast-fashion retailers is also important, adds Perkins.
"
2358,EBAY,"They also need to make their websites more mobile friendly and easy to use, he adds, as well as create more of a store ""experience"" so teens want to hang out and shop there.Rita Wicks was doing some serious shopping at the Forever 21 store in Times Square on the first Monday in June.Arms filled with skirts, tops and shorts, the 18-year-old New York native was on the final stretch of her buying spree at Forever 21, where she had already spent $700 in the past month on a wardrobe for her soon-to-start college freshman year.Wicks prefers Forever 21 over teen apparel retailers such as American Eagle Outfitters (AEO), where she buys her jeans.""The clothes are cuter and more reasonably priced at Forever 21,"" said Wicks.

Parents are struggling with poor employment and wages.And there are just too many stores chasing too few teens.""Specialty teen retailing remains at overcapacity domestically with growth continuing to outpace the teen population,"" according to a 2014 Piper Jaffray survey of 7,500 teens at an average age of 16.4 years.From 1999 to 2007, the industry grew at a 39% compound annual growth rate, while the teen population grew at a low single-digit rate, says the survey. Over the last five years, the teen population has contracted while teen-retail square footage has expanded at a low single-digit rate per year.For all these reasons, teen retailers have significantly underperformed other merchants since the start of last year, says Perkins. In Q1, the segment reported an earnings decline of 130% — an outright loss — vs. an estimated 4.2% drop for the industry as a whole. Analysts see another loss for the teen apparel group in the current quarter.Limited spending power has prompted teens to ""migrate"" to the fast-fashion chains where they get more bang for their buck than they do at the teen apparel stores, adds Brain Sozzi, CEO of Belus Capital Advisors.Cheap Chic""These fast-fashion companies have done a phenomenal job undercutting all the traditional mall retailers on price, and they're giving teens an assortment that can't be found anywhere in the mall,"" said Sozzi.""If these stores can offer something like a pair of jeans for about 50% less than at, say, American Eagle, the teen is willing to have lower-quality merchandise as long as the assortment looks fashionable from 10 yards away.""Fast-fashion chains turn over merchandise quickly and offer teens new floor sets weekly to create buzz and excitement.The chains turn their merchandise in weeks, and in other instances it's months.The traditional teen retailer requires a longer lead time of six to nine months and typically rolls over merchandise a couple of times a season, Perkins adds.How do the fast-fashion retailers produce so quickly? They have ""massive supply chain infrastructure,"" says Kernan. They also ""tend to buy millions of yards of fabric far in advance of production"" since they don't know what style or fit they'll need.The factories ""in turn are fed consistent business and orders"" from these retailers, he adds.Accessorizing TrendCohen says there's been a lack of fashion innovation in the teen space, which has created a ""void.""""The categories that were driving teen spending growth in the past are not growing,"" he said. ""They're trading down and spending on accessories rather than clothing.""They're buying less-expensive things like leggings instead of jeans and tights instead of pants.It's all about ""accessorizing,"" be it in fashions or their electronics, Cohen says.""There's been a shift in fashion preference away from uniform dressing where logos were more important toward mix and match and personal style,"" said Citi Research analyst Oliver Chen.And with a lack of any ""dominant"" fashion trend, multiple trends are working, he adds.Teens are dressing with different brands and mixing high-end and low-end items rather than wearing one brand ""head to toe,"" he says.What do teen retailers have to do to lure their customers back?""They need to focus on executing on trend-right products, and they need to rationalize their store bases,"" said Chen.They also need to ""reinvent their brands to stay relevant,"" he adds.Bringing merchandise into stores more quickly to ""generate buzz"" and become more competitive with the fast-fashion retailers is also important, adds Perkins.They also need to make their websites more mobile friendly and easy to use, he adds, as well as create more of a store ""experience"" so teens want to hang out and shop there.

2466,EBAY,"EBay (EBAY) and activist investor Carl Icahn escalated their war of words Thursday morning over Icahn's proposed spinoff of PayPal.EBay founder and Chairman Pierre Omidyar issued a statement that rebuffed Icahn's charges of conflicts of interest on the company's board. Icahn quickly responded to Omidyar, saying in an open letter to eBay shareholders that ""We look forward to an honest, accurate debate on the issues we have raised.""Icahn, who has nominated two of his employees to serve on eBay's board, said Monday that he's raised his stake in eBay to 2.15%. In the last several weeks, the veteran corporate raider has accused eBay's board members of conflicts of interest and governance lapses, while he continues to press his case that eBay spin off PayPal.EBay has opposed Icahn's efforts.""A new eBay shareholder, Carl Icahn, is making unsubstantiated claims about our company — and deliberately impugning the integrity of our directors,"" Omidyar said, branding Icahn's attacks as ""false and misleading."" ""After acquiring a stake in our company, Mr. Icahn asked a good question: Should PayPal continue to be part of eBay? This is not a new idea. It is a question our board has asked ourselves as we periodically evaluate strategic options for the company.""Our board is deeply committed to doing what's in the best interests of shareholders. After diligent consideration, we believe that PayPal and eBay are better together. In the future, if we determine that's no longer true, we will act accordingly and in the best interests of shareholders and the company.""The flap erupted on Jan. 22 when eBay disclosed as part of its Q4 results that Icahn had taken a 0.82% stake in the e-commerce and payments powerhouse and proposed spinning off PayPal, an idea EBay's board rejected.Icahn also has grabbed stakes and pushed for changes at other tech companies, including Apple (AAPL) and Yahoo (YHOO).He said he would be be happy to debate the issues with eBay in a ""public forum"" that was offered by CNBC on Wednesday.""We immediately told CNBC we would be happy to do it, but we doubt eBay will accept its own challenge. We will soon find out. At this moment, not surprising to us, eBay has not responded. We eagerly await their reply,"" Icahn said in his letter to shareholders Thursday.EBay stock was up 2.5% in midday trading in the stock market today.
"
2467,EBAY,"Corporate raider Carl Icahn on Thursday unexpectedly ended his pitched campaign to force eBay (EBAY) to spin off its lucrative PayPal payments unit after reaching a deal with eBay's management to add an independent director to the auction website company's board. Icahn, who holds a roughly 2% stake in eBay, also agreed to withdraw his two nominees to eBay's board.
"
2468,EBAY,"The independent board member is David Dorman, the 60-year-old chairman of CVS Caremark (CVS). Dorman is also a founding partner of Centerview Capital Technology, a private investment firm. EBay has agreed to make Dorman the 10th member of its 12-member board.

2471,EBAY,"""As a result of our conversations, it became clear that Carl and I strongly agree on the potential of PayPal and our company,"" Donahoe said. ""I respect Carl's willingness to work together to drive sustainable shareholder value today and into the future. His record shows that he has done this with many other companies in the past.""
"
2472,EBAY,"Icahn said in a statement that he continues ""to believe that eBay would benefit from the separation of PayPal at some point in the near future."" Icahn added that he intends to continue to press his case through confidential discussions with the company. ""While John (Donahoe) has made no commitments regarding such a separation, he and I have agreed to meet regularly when he is in New York to discuss strategic alternatives,"" Icahn said. ""We look forward to working with (the) board of directors and management with a common objective of creating sustainable value for all shareholders. Our record shows that our involvement with boards and management has greatly enhanced long term value for all shareholders, and we hope and believe this will continue with eBay.""
"
2473,EBAY,"The apparently amicable settlement between Icahn and eBay contrasts with Icahn's earlier attacks on the company in which he questioned Donahoe's competency as CEO and questioned the integrity of various eBay board members.

2474,EBAY,"Donahoe said in a Bloomberg Television interview on Thursday that eBay's clash with Icahn began to wind down when Jimmy Lee, JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s (JPM) vice president, began acting as an intermediary and encouraged Donahoe and Icahn to settle.
"
2475,EBAY,"As part of the deal, Icahn signed a confidentiality agreement with eBay that covers any non-public information that directors and certain officers of the company may share with him. In return, eBay has agreed not to adopt a policy precluding such persons from speaking with Icahn.

2596,EBAY,"A scuba diver swims above a reef dotted with colorful fish. An elderly couple ballroom dances on a beach at sunset. A woman sits on the edge of a rock, meditating at twilight.Then ""Diamond Resorts International (DRII): simplicity, choice, comfort,"" a voice says as the six-minute commercial on YouTube ends.Calling itself a provider of ""affordable luxury and priceless memories,"" Diamond offers vacations in 34 countries at 93 managed resorts, 154 affiliated resorts, 52 affiliated hotels and four cruise itineraries.The vacation packages are low-priced — such as five days and four nights in Cabo San Lucas for $292 or four days and three nights in Las Vegas for $92 — and are a marketing tool.The catch is that customers must be creditworthy, age 25 and older, earning at least $50,000 annually and ready to watch a one-and-a-half to two-hour sales pitch for joining Diamond's club. In the club, members buy points to use toward vacation packages.One of the costliest getaways, a nine-day European cruise on Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings' (NCLH) Norwegian Star, costs 20,000 points at peak season. Among the cheapest, a one-week stay in an Ormond Beach, Fla., studio, runs 1,200 points in low season.Funding The FunDiamond plans to increase its sales force 5%-10% annually over the next few years and boost sales to Asian customers, CEO David Palmer told IBD. About 70% of customers finance their purchase at a 15% average annual interest rate. The rate varies by the down payment, which is typically 10%.Diamond bundles customers' loans into securities and resells them to insurance companies and other institutional investors, eliminating its risk in customer defaults. About 6% of customers default on their loans; about 3.5% default on maintenance fees, said Palmer.As a ""Silver Elite"" member, Lee Huffman of Anaheim Hills, Calif., pays a $2,400 annual maintenance fee and gets 15,000 points every year in perpetuity. The finance manager of a midsize bank in Southern California and his family have used the points to stay at Diamond Resorts in California, Cabo San Lucas, Paris and Sydney.""We prefer the comfort, convenience and cost savings of timeshares over hotels even more now that we have a child,"" said Huffman. He views his timeshare as an asset in his estate that he can pass on to his 3-year-old son.As of Jan. 1, 2014, points start at $7.66 each with a minimum purchase of 2,500 points, for $19,150, according to DiamondResorts.com. Members must also pay annual maintenance fees, which vary based on their membership levels, and incidental assessment fees for renovations or large repairs.Huffman and 524,000 fellow Diamond members can be credited for fueling the company's rapid sales and earnings growth. In its third quarter as a public company, the Las Vegas-based firm exceeded analysts' expectations. It beat earnings and sales forecasts on top of lifting full-year guidance when it reported first-quarter results May 1.Revenue grew 18% year over year to $181 million, eclipsing the $177 million consensus of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) vaulted 37% from a year ago to $67 million, topping JPMorgan's forecasts of $51 million by 31%.Diamond raised its full-year 2014 EBITDA guidance to $265 million to $280 million, from previous guidance of $255 million to $265 million, partly because it managed to refinance a 12% loan at a much lower interest rate. It expects to save it about $22 million a year in interest.Performance Since IPODiamond stock has risen 40% from its $14 IPO price in July 2013.In a conference call with analysts, CEO Palmer said the company uses a ""capital-light model with minimal development capex required,"" which means that instead of building its own properties, Diamond adds inventory by buying out existing resorts. Diamond also collects fees from managing properties in homeowners associations.""Unlike its peers, with no significant plans to invest capital in new timeshare development, it sources inventory from recapturing vacation ownership interests from members who default on payment of their homeowners association dues and its bank of unsold points,"" JPMorgan analyst Joseph Gregg and colleagues wrote in a note May 1.Inside The IndustryAbout 30% of Diamond's earnings come from managing resorts, a task that's very profitable, says Gregg.""Diamond is in a position to generate appealing earnings growth, driven by what we view as sustainable operating momentum in vacation ownership and steady uplift in management fees,"" Gregg and colleagues noted. ""We forecast improving free cash-flow performance, given growth in its higher-margin management business.""Diamond is the 12th largest company by market cap in IBD's Leisure-Lodging industry group, whose biggest components are Hilton Worldwide Holdings (HLT), Marriott International (MAR) and Starwood Hotels & Resorts (HOT). The group is ranked No. 79 in performance of 197 that IBD tracks.Vacation ownership can be a controversial line of business, however, and Diamond is no stranger to complaints.""In one year, fees rose by more than 40%. A similar figure the next year. Soon the maintenance fees exceeded the cost of staying in a Diamond Resorts apartment for a holiday through Expedia (EXPE), including airfares,"" a Gloucestershire, U.K.-based entrepreneur, who did not want his name published, said in an email. ""To add insult to injury, it became almost impossible to get a booking for any property except during off peak.""Diamond's management fees exceeded rental rates by 47% to 180% for various properties he saw online, he says, and when he refused to pay, he got calls every day — sometimes twice a day — and was told that he would be turned over to a collection agency. Diamond finally canceled his contract after he complained to every agency in the U.S. and U.K. that would listen, he says.""I just made a right royal nuisance of myself,"" he said in an email.Unwanted Diamond points can be had for pennies on the dollar on eBay (EBAY) and timeshare-resale websites. Only 3% of timeshares sell on the resale market, says Jeff Griffen, a senior executive at ResortBailout.com. The East Hartford, Conn.-based firm helps clients unload a timeshare for one to three years in annual maintenance fees plus closing costs.Walking away from a timeshare is like letting a house go into foreclosure, which could result in property liens, stained credit histories and even wage garnishment, according to Griffen. In addition, customers can finance their purchase only through Diamond, he says.Over the past three years, 525 complaints against Diamond were filed with the Better Business Bureau. Owners in Koloa, Hawaii, filed a class-action lawsuit over a $65,822,529 water-intrusion assessment, local media reported.Investing RisksSince owning a timeshare is a luxury that most people can do without, a global or U.S. economic slowdown could deplete demand for new purchases or hinder people's ability to repay their loans.""Currently, no effective secondary market exists to resell timeshare,"" Robert LaFleur and Whitney Stevenson, analysts at JMP Securities, wrote in a note May 2. ""If an effective and cost-efficient secondary market develops, Diamond's ability to sell vacation interests through its existing sales channels could be seriously impaired.""Among other risks, rising interest rates would increase borrowing costs for both Diamond and its customers, which could squeeze margins and dampen demand.Diamond will be increasingly more dependent on the securities market to get money and maintain growth in vacation-ownership sales, Gregg of JPMorgan says. Growth depends on its success in selling to new customers rather than existing customers.

That's up 16% from the year-ago quarter and a penny above the consensus estimate of 39 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters.Sales rose 14% to $3.89 billion, modestly missing analyst views of $3.91 billion.But the company expects EPS ex items this quarter of 79 cents to 81 cents, below analyst views of 83 cents. It sees sales of $4.5 billion to $4.6 billion, falling short of analyst views of $4.64 billion.Chief Financial Officer Bob Swan said in a post-earnings conference call with analysts that the light guidance reflected softer U.S. e-commerce trends that might carry over into the Q4 holiday shopping season.Swan also said macroeconomic trends in Europe and Asia-Pacific appear to be stabilizing.JPMorgan's Anmuth, in a research report Thursday, said he remains ""positive"" on the company's strong user acquisition trends. He said user growth at eBay's e-commerce business and its PayPal payments unit remained strong, though it will take some time for new user growth to translate into more revenue growth. He also says PayPal's total payment volume remains strong.""While in-line Q3 results and (softer Q4 guidance) are likely to pressure shares in the near term, we think improving U.S. e-commerce trends, mobile growth, international expansion and expanding payment margins could drive growth beyond 2013,"" Anmuth wrote.He is maintaining his overweight, or buy, rating on eBay stock, but lowered his price target to 56 from 60.EBay said its mobile apps drew 3.2 million customers in Q3 and that mobile enabled e-commerce volume was up 75% in the quarter. PayPal's TPV grew 25% to $44 billion.Canaccord's Graham lowered his price target on eBay to 60 from 64 Thursday, but reiterated his buy rating on the stock.""EBay met our Q3 EPS estimates, but Q4 guidance has been pushed to the very low end of the previous range, and to a level slightly below our estimates,"" Graham wrote in a report. ""Q4 is being impacted by the expectation for a sluggish holiday period for U.S. e-commerce along with some higher spending on key initiatives.""EBay stock was trading near 51.30 early Thursday.RELATED: EBay Goes Ahead With Brazil Strategy, Launches App.

2642,EBAY,"Carl Icahn's succeeded in sparking lots of public debate between major technology and investment figures with his proposal to take PayPal out of eBay. Some analysts say the level of commentary is proof that Icahn is being taken seriously by friend and foe alike. ""You've gotten some really well-known players commenting on what they think and what they would like…

2643,EBAY,"Amazon.com could face a backlash for hiking the annual membership fee on its Amazon Prime service to $99 from $79, a survey shows.The higher cost might nudge some shoppers to drop their Prime memberships and buy fewer items on Amazon (AMZN), according to findings from the survey by research firm Bizrate Insights.The increase comes at a time when complaints are surfacing about prices charged for some third-party goods sold on Amazon.com and as some consumers have become irked that Amazon now collects state sales taxes. (See related story, this page.)""Everybody knows online shoppers are price sensitive,"" Hayley Silver, a vice president with Bizrate, told IBD.The unit of online-retail site Shopzilla found in a recent survey that only 43% of Prime members definitely plan to renew their membership at the $99 price. Only 15%, however, said they would not renew. The rest were undecided.Silver says the results show that price is a factor even for a familiar and trusted name like Amazon.Bizrate polled 4,200 online buyers in March after Amazon announced its higher Prime fee. It was the first increase since Amazon launched the popular service nine years ago. Prime includes free two-day shipping on all orders, video streaming and e-book borrowing.Big EPS Boost SeenThe increase defrays more of the program's shipping expenses and bolsters Amazon's bottom line.RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney estimates in a March 13 research note that the increase will generate $300 million to $400 million in annual operating income, leading to a 45-cent to 55-cent increase in earnings per share. Amazon posted EPS of just 59 cents last year, as it continues to spend heavily to expand its warehouses and other operations.But some analysts fear that the rising Prime fee, if it deters renewals and new signups, could further slow revenue growth, which has fallen from 41% in 2011 to 27% in 2012 and 22% in 2013.Analysts estimate that Amazon has more than 20 million Prime members, though the company has never disclosed that figure.The Bizrate survey found that when shoppers choose between Amazon and another retailer, familiarity with the retailer matters. When the retailer is familiar, lowest total cost is critical to the decision, with the non-Prime customers more price sensitive.Non-Prime members get free shipping from Amazon on orders of $35 and up — Amazon raised it from $25 in October — but delivery is not guaranteed within two days.Forrester Research analyst Sucharita Mulpuru-Kodali points to an example of a big, well-liked Internet company facing lots of heat when it raised prices.Online video service Netflix (NFLX), an Amazon rival in the video-streaming market, raised its prices on its DVD and online movie packages in July 2011, only to lose more subscribers than it expected.""If Netflix's (past increases) are any sign, then people don't like price hikes of any sort,"" said Mulpuru-Kodali.Video, Lending HelpThe Bizrate poll found that those who intend to renew Prime at the $99 value especially like the fact that it includes Amazon's video-streaming service, called Instant Video, and the Kindle Lending Library, Amazon's program that lets its Kindle users borrow e-books.An upbeat factor for Amazon is that those who intend to renew Prime at the $99 rate placed more Amazon orders in the past year than the others, based on the poll's results.Bizrate says Amazon can do four things to boost Prime renewals:1. Make more products available under Prime,2. Add more, and better, shows to its Instant Video service,3. Increase the number of e-books available in the Kindle Lending Library program, and4. Offer some exclusive discounts for Prime members.Amazon's rivals don't have the e-commerce leader's huge fulfillment centers and vast product selection, nor do many offer the perks that come with Prime.""Amazon is still my 'go to' for online shopping,"" Elena McCoy, a San Francisco area corporate affairs director, told IBD. ""Three reasons: ease of use, a wide variety of choices, and Amazon Prime two-day shipping... . The price increase for Amazon Prime doesn't bother me because it's still an incredible deal.""But some observers contend the higher fee makes alternatives more alluring. It might siphon more sales from Amazon and contribute to its slowing revenue growth.The higher cost narrows Amazon's price advantages. Websites for chain retailers such as WalMart (WMT), The Gap (GPS) and Banana Republic offer free shipping on orders of $50 or more.Websites of these and other retailers are crowded with discounts, and Amazon doesn't always list the lowest total cost.""There is definitely an opportunity for retailers and shop owners to test consumer loyalty programs"" that challenge Amazon, Bizrate's Silver said.Some Amazon rivals are improving their shipping operations. Macy's (M) is using inventory held at its stores to make deliveries for online shoppers nationwide. The chain offers free shipping for online orders of $99 and above. Under an order-fulfillment system launched in 2012, Macy's stores in some regions are getting the capability to serve as product warehouses and ship items that have been ordered online. Macy's hopes to offer same-day delivery in parts of the U.S. eventually.Amazon has long been on the same-day-delivery quest. The company is testing AmazonFresh, a same-day grocery delivery service, on orders of at least $35 in parts of Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle. Some observers say knowledge gained from AmazonFresh will help Amazon eventually implement same-day delivery for many other products.Amazon faces competition. EBay (EBAY) is testing same-day delivery in San Jose, Calif., San Francisco and New York City. Google (GOOG) is testing a Google Shopping Express same-day service in San Francisco.The free shipping tests online sellers, observers say.""Prime is a very expensive program for Amazon, especially the promise that packages arrive within two days,"" said Forrester's Mulpuru-Kodali. ""They had no choice but to raise prices, but even at that, it's still an expensive program. We'll never know the churn rate (for Amazon Prime) because Amazon never shares (that data).""

2645,EBAY,"Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. recently filed with U.S. exchanges1 for approval to sell shares to the public for the first time, which could amount to one of the largest initial public offering (IPO) in history. Alibaba is an Internet-based e-commerce business, similar to companies like Amazon2 and eBay3, but it is even larger than the combination of the two from a revenue perspective. From a business model perspective, it includes online payments, cloud services, online travel, music and video streaming, e-learning and even financial services.

2647,EBAY,"SoftBank Corp. Has Benefited from Alibaba 
"
2648,EBAY,"One of the beneficiaries, if there were no further dilution of its stake through the IPO4, of Alibaba's success is SoftBank Corp., which owns approximately 34.4% of Alibaba. SoftBank5 is the largest holdings in the WisdomTree Japan Hedged Tech, Media and Telecom Fund (DXJT). For current holdings of DXJT click here. 
"
2649,EBAY,"Since the start of ""Abenomics"", SoftBank is up about 150%, approximately three times the TOPIX return of 53%.6 Please keep in mind that high double-digit and/or triple-digit returns are highly unusual and cannot be sustained. Investors should also be aware that these returns were achieved primarily during favorable market conditions. There is no question that the Abenomics policies have helped profitability and equity returns of both SoftBank and broad Japanese equities and many investors are optimistic about Alibaba, but without access to it, they have the opportunity to purchase SoftBank to gain exposure to Alibaba. 
"
2650,EBAY,"SoftBank recently announced record earnings for its most recent fiscal year, proudly boasting about generating more than ¥1 trillion of operating profit, a 36% increase year-over-year.7 SoftBank also reported that Alibaba Group's net income grew four times year-over-year to more than ¥350 billion. Transaction volume for Alibaba also surged to ¥25 trillion, outpacing eBay's and Amazon's combined ¥16 trillion. SoftBank stated that Alibaba contributed ¥74.4 billion of the ¥586.1 billion, or approximately 13%, of its reported net income. 
"
2651,EBAY,"Alibaba's estimated market value ranges from ¥12.5 trillion to ¥20.0 trillion (US$125 billion to US$200 billion) based on analyst estimates, so given SoftBank's 34.4% ownership, its stake could potentially be valued at between ¥4.3 trillion and ¥6.9 trillion (US$43 billion to US$69 billion). Considering that SoftBank's market value was ¥9.36 trillion (US$91 billion) at the end of the reporting period8, Alibaba's value could represent anywhere from 45% to 75% of SoftBank's market value.9 
"
2652,EBAY,"If the projected valuation range for Alibaba is accurate, I find it very interesting that Alibaba represents such a large percentage of SoftBank's market value. Alibaba has reported that SoftBank will continue to own more than 30% of its issued and outstanding ordinary shares after the completion of the initial public offering10. But it is also important to consider that even without the Alibaba equity ownership, SoftBank was profitable over the reporting period and has other business ventures and pursuits. 
"
2653,EBAY,"Last year, SoftBank successfully took control of Sprint11 and is pursuing a deal with T-Mobile12. Masayoshi Son13 has attributed the ultra-low financing that is available in Japan as a key factor in helping spur mergers and acquisitions. Given his longer-term outlook and the cheap financing, it is clear that SoftBank desires to continue growing, and he views Alibaba as a strategic partner for its long-term success.

2655,EBAY,"WisdomTree developed five new Japan sector exchange-traded funds (ETFs) designed to be vehicles for investment themes stemming from Abenomics, depending on investors' objectives. DXJT is designed to provide exposure to tech, media and telecom companies in Japan, while at the same time hedging the currency exposure. The Fund has more than 60% weight in the Information Technology sector and approximately 20% in both the Telecommunication Services and Consumer Discretionary sectors. Currently, the Fund's top holding is SoftBank, with a weight of 9.99%14. With this large allocation to SoftBank and how much of its market cap is derived from Alibaba, some may want to look to DXJT as an indirect way to participate in the potential growth of Alibaba.

Abe is pursuing pro-business issues by arguing for a lower corporate tax rate and urging companies and investors to stay focused on generating profits. Technology companies should also receive a boost from new government initiatives supporting additional capital spending and tax policies encouraging business consolidation. DXJT, with the heavy weight to SoftBank, is even more in focus now with news of this latest IPO.

2662,EBAY,"Alibaba Group is described as Amazon, eBay, PayPal and Google all wrapped into one and potentially the biggest tech IPO ever.

2663,EBAY,"Carl Icahn has hit a nerve with some eBay shareholders.
"
2664,EBAY,"Many analysts were skeptical in late January when the veteran corporate raider revealed he had taken a nearly 1% stake in the payment and e-commerce giant and said he would press eBay (EBAY) to spin off its lucrative PayPal unit to unlock greater shareholder value.
"
2665,EBAY,"Most observers said Icahn needed a much larger stake — at least 25%, noted Susquehanna Financial Group — and deep shareholder support to force a showdown with eBay directors, who have rejected his proposal and continued their 2-year-old restructuring and international expansion efforts.
"
2666,EBAY,"The eBay gambit adds to the portfolio of Icahn, who moved similarly with Apple (AAPL), Netflix (NFLX), Yahoo (YHOO) and other companies in pursuit of his activist agenda.
"
2667,EBAY,"A report last week by Bernstein Research found many shareholders aren't happy with eBay's directors — adding grist to Icahn's call for a boardroom shuffle.
"
2668,EBAY,"The report by Bernstein analyst Carlos Kirjner says 55% of investors feel the composition of eBay's board should change, though only 42% favor spinning off PayPal and fewer than 30% favor giving Icahn a board seat. Bernstein polled 178 investors, nearly half of whom were eBay shareholders. About two-thirds were long on the company, and one-third were composed of hedge funds.
"
2669,EBAY,"Kirjner declined further comment beyond the report. But some other analysts are also lending more credence to Icahn's spinoff proposal. ""We think there's merit to possibly separating (eBay from PayPal),"" S&P Capital IQ equity analyst Scott Kessler told IBD, noting that eBay could preserve its ""synergies"" with PayPal even if it becomes a separate company.

2670,EBAY,"EBay's Alibaba?
"
2671,EBAY,"Robert Wagner, who bills himself as an independent analyst, noted in a report on the Seeking Alpha website last week titled ""PayPal Could Be EBay's Alibaba"" the similarity to how Yahoo's value is underpinned by its 24% holding in China e-commerce leader Alibaba, which could launch a U.S. IPO this year.
"
2672,EBAY,"Wagner says a PayPal spinoff would make the payment king a better platform for strategic acquisitions — especially in mobile payments. He also speculates that an independent PayPal would develop a virtual payment currency tailored to merchant needs that would differ from Bitcoin, a digital currency that's a favorite of speculators.
"
2673,EBAY,"""I imagine PayPal could (develop a digital currency product), but given that they haven't, I assume eBay either hasn't thought of it or isn't interested. An independent PayPal would likely be forced to address the virtual currency issue,"" Wagner wrote.

"
2678,EBAY,"But in January, when the company released Q4 earnings, it lowered its 2015 revenue outlook to $20.5 billion to $21.5 billion.
"
2679,EBAY,"PayPal also might be lagging the company's forecast. At that March 2013 meeting, PayPal President David Marcus predicted his firm's total payment volume would double from $145 billion at the end of 2012 to roughly $290 billion at the end of 2015. PayPal reported $180 billion in TPV for 2013, so it has to pick up its pace to hit its target.
"
2680,EBAY,"""A lot of the optimism around (eBay) stock was about what they could do about PayPal, and this has clearly fallen short of expectations,"" ITG analyst Steve Weinstein told IBD.
"
2681,EBAY,"EBay's board has shown its unhappiness. Its executive compensation committee cut Donahoe's 2013 compensation by 53%. The committee ""concluded that while Mr. Donahoe continued to perform well against many ... goals, the (company's) financial performance for 2013 and positioning relative to its competitors at the start of 2014 did not fully meet expectations,"" it said in a proxy statement filed Monday.
"
2682,EBAY,"S&P's Kessler says eBay could gain from a PayPal spinoff. It could keep a majority stake in PayPal, helping its own valuation while using its PayPal shares to help fund new acquisitions. ""PayPal stock would command a high valuation that (would provide leverage) for acquisitions"" by eBay, he said.
"
2683,EBAY,"EBay points out that removing PayPal would interfere with how the payment unit generates growth for its marketplaces unit, and vice versa. Executives underscore the benefits of eBay and PayPal sharing business information, fraud detection technology and marketing resources. But Kessler says there are ways to preserve these synergies even with a PayPal spinoff.

At that March 2013 meeting, PayPal President David Marcus predicted his firm's total payment volume would double from $145 billion at the end of 2012 to roughly $290 billion at the end of 2015. PayPal reported $180 billion in TPV for 2013, so it has to pick up its pace to hit its target.""A lot of the optimism around (eBay) stock was about what they could do about PayPal, and this has clearly fallen short of expectations,"" ITG analyst Steve Weinstein told IBD.EBay's board has shown its unhappiness. Its executive compensation committee cut Donahoe's 2013 compensation by 53%. The committee ""concluded that while Mr. Donahoe continued to perform well against many ... goals, the (company's) financial performance for 2013 and positioning relative to its competitors at the start of 2014 did not fully meet expectations,"" it said in a proxy statement filed Monday.S&P's Kessler says eBay could gain from a PayPal spinoff. It could keep a majority stake in PayPal, helping its own valuation while using its PayPal shares to help fund new acquisitions. ""PayPal stock would command a high valuation that (would provide leverage) for acquisitions"" by eBay, he said.EBay points out that removing PayPal would interfere with how the payment unit generates growth for its marketplaces unit, and vice versa. Executives underscore the benefits of eBay and PayPal sharing business information, fraud detection technology and marketing resources. But Kessler says there are ways to preserve these synergies even with a PayPal spinoff.Kessler notes that he broached the idea of a PayPal spinoff as far back as when he made his predictions for 2011.

2686,EBAY,"Activist investor Carl Icahn faces a long haul in getting enough board support to push through his hopes of getting eBay to spin off PayPal.
"
2687,EBAY,"EBay (EBAY) surprised Wall Street on Wednesday with news that Icahn had taken a 0.82% stake in the payments and e-commerce giant and has proposed that it spin off its lucrative PayPal payments unit into a separate company.
"
2688,EBAY,"The veteran corporate raider, who has grabbed stakes and pushed for changes at other tech companies such as Apple (AAPL) and Yahoo (YHOO), also nominated two of his employees to serve on eBay's board.
"
2689,EBAY,"EBay's structure, though, makes it hard for Icahn to get enough allies on the board, says Susquehanna Financial Group.
"
2690,EBAY,"The current eBay board has rejected Icahn's spinoff proposal.
"
2691,EBAY,"EBay CEO John Donahoe characterized the spinoff as an ""old idea"" in a conference call with analysts on Wednesday, when the company also released Q4 earnings.
"
2692,EBAY,"While four of eBay's 11 board seats are up for election this year, the nominations deadline was Jan. 18, says Susquehanna analyst King She.
"
2693,EBAY,"Only 4 Seats Up For Election
"
2694,EBAY,"Icahn, according to She in a research report last week, met the deadline with his two nominations, but even if the two are elected at the annual shareholders meeting, expected in mid-April, it will be another year before Icahn could get any more directors aboard.
"
2695,EBAY,"""The way the board is structured, the best-case scenario is that (Icahn) can only get two of the 11 board seats this year,"" Susquehanna analyst Brian Nowak, who works with She, told IBD. ""This means that in order to do a PayPal spinoff in 2014, he would have to convince the board members and management to change the way they've been thinking about (the) business."" That, says Nowak, is very unlikely.
"
2696,EBAY,"But Icahn, who heads diversified holding company Icahn Enterprises, could have better luck next year, says the investment bank. That's because all 11 board seats are up for re-election in 2015, it says.
"
2697,EBAY,"Icahn by then also could have boosted his stake in eBay and rallied other investors to his idea.
"
2698,EBAY,"Susquehanna's She points out that eBay's certificate of incorporation lets shareholders call special meetings to discuss issues like a spinoff, but only if the shareholders have held at least a 25% stake for at least 30 days.
"
2699,EBAY,"Icahn could use this route to bring the issue of a PayPal spinoff to a head, but She notes it could be a very expensive proposition for Icahn. Such a 25% position in eBay would cost Icahn and any investor allies he is able to bring aboard about $18 billion, based on the current price of eBay shares, according to She.
"
2700,EBAY,"In addition, eBay's certificate of incorporation doesn't allow so-called shareholder action, says She. This denies Icahn another avenue to force a PayPal spinoff.
"
2701,EBAY,"Under shareholder action by written consent, shareholders have the right — except as otherwise provided in a company's certificate of incorporation — to take any action that might also be taken at any annual or special meeting of such shareholders, without holding such a meeting.
"
2702,EBAY,"They can do this without prior notice and without a vote, if voting shareholders have consented in writing.
"
2703,EBAY,"In any case, analyst Nowak says, eBay can't afford to separate PayPal from its marketplaces, mobile and other e-commerce offerings without undermining its push into online and offline e-commerce. PayPal is the payments glue that holds everything together, he says.
"
2704,EBAY,"ITG Internet analyst Steven Weinstein also sides with eBay's board on the wisdom of not spinning off PayPal.
"
2705,EBAY,"""If you look at management's long-term direction for eBay, it involves an integrated approach to omni-channel e-commerce,"" Weinstein said. ""Incorporating a strong payment mechanism is key, and eBay's built a lot of PayPal's functionality around that. To (separate) PayPal from eBay would ruin that long-term strategy.""
"
2706,EBAY,"More Than 40% Of Revenue
"
2707,EBAY,"PayPal is a key source of revenue for eBay, helping to underpin the value of eBay shares. It accounted for $6.6 billion of eBay's total revenue of $16.05 billion in revenue in 2013, or 41%.
"
2708,EBAY,"PayPal could be worth as much as $40 billion as a separate company, analysts have speculated. EBay's current market value is near $70 billion.
"
2709,EBAY,"Icahn's next moves are still unclear. A Reuters story on Friday quoted ""a source close to the matter"" as saying that Icahn's stake stood closer to 2%, rather than 0.82%.
"
2710,EBAY,"Still, most analysts seem to agree that he needs much more time and effort to force a showdown with eBay's board.
"
2711,EBAY,"Icahn told the Wall Street Journal in an interview published Thursday that he's digging in for a proxy fight to win his two nominees seats on eBay's board.Activist investor Carl Icahn faces a long haul in getting enough board support to push through his hopes of getting eBay to spin off PayPal.EBay (EBAY) surprised Wall Street on Wednesday with news that Icahn had taken a 0.82% stake in the payments and e-commerce giant and has proposed that it spin off its lucrative PayPal payments unit into a separate company.The veteran corporate raider, who has grabbed stakes and pushed for changes at other tech companies such as Apple (AAPL) and Yahoo (YHOO), also nominated two of his employees to serve on eBay's board.EBay's structure, though, makes it hard for Icahn to get enough allies on the board, says Susquehanna Financial Group.The current eBay board has rejected Icahn's spinoff proposal.EBay CEO John Donahoe characterized the spinoff as an ""old idea"" in a conference call with analysts on Wednesday, when the company also released Q4 earnings.While four of eBay's 11 board seats are up for election this year, the nominations deadline was Jan. 18, says Susquehanna analyst King She.Only 4 Seats Up For ElectionIcahn, according to She in a research report last week, met the deadline with his two nominations, but even if the two are elected at the annual shareholders meeting, expected in mid-April, it will be another year before Icahn could get any more directors aboard.""The way the board is structured, the best-case scenario is that (Icahn) can only get two of the 11 board seats this year,"" Susquehanna analyst Brian Nowak, who works with She, told IBD.

Earnings per share climbed 38% to 53 cents a share, beating forecasts by 10 cents. The company at the time guided full-year 2014 EPS of $1.95 to $2, at least a nickel above analyst consensus.CEO Ge Li said in a post-earnings statement that the 2014 EPS outlook reflected ""strong revenue growth and investment in talent, laboratories and technologies"" as the company expands globally.WuXi's stock had a strong two-year run, rising 252% from the end of 2011 to a 37.52 high at the end of 2013. Its stock sports a 96 IBD Composite Rating, meaning that it's outperformed 96% of all stocks on sales and earnings growth in recent quarters.But it's mostly traded in a narrow range this year, and some funds have sold its shares. WuXi has a D- IBD Accumulation/Distribution Rating, indicating moderate to heavy selling in the last 13 weeks. Shares rose 2% on the stock market Thursday.Qihoo 360 Technology (QIHU), the second Chinese company on the screen, provides search services, security software and online games.

But Qihoo is making inroads and now handles more than 25% of China's Web traffic. Both Baidu and Qihoo 360 have been spending heavily on mobile to gain users and advertising.Qihoo, which has a D+ A/D Rating, indicating moderate selling, is on the IBD 50 list of top-rated stocks. Shares jumped 4% Thursday. Baidu rose 3%.Third on the screen is e-commerce company Vipshop Holdings (VIPS), a smaller counterpart to U.S. online retailers such as Amazon (AMZN) and eBay (EBAY). Vipshop is known for offering branded apparel at discount prices along with ""flash"" daily deals. It competes in China with Jack Ma's privately held online retail giant Alibaba Group, which is expected to go public shortly on the NYSE in what will likely be the largest tech IPO ever, analysts say.Vipshop's shares jumped 32% on March 4 after it reported that quarterly earnings had tripled on a 117% increase in sales. Vipshop has a C+ A/D Rating, indicating that slightly more funds are buying shares than selling.

2783,EBAY,"Speculation that Google (GOOG) could add wireless service to areas where it builds out a superfast fiber-optic broadband network has analysts mulling a wide range of options.The Information, a pay-walled website, on Thursday said Google approached Verizon Wireless (VZ) about a wholesale deal. Under one scenario, Google could lease network capacity from Verizon, which has the biggest 4G LTE network, to offer its own services.Over the years, Google has also been linked to a possible networking leasing deal with Sprint (S), which trails Verizon and AT&T (T) in building out a 4G network. And Google in 2012 reportedly talked with Dish Network (DISH), a satellite broadcaster that has been amassing wireless spectrum.Oppenheimer analyst Tim Horan, in a research report Friday, speculated that Google might even acquire T-Mobile US (TMUS), which is 67% owned by Germany's Deutsche Telekom (DTEGY).Google said in February that it's in talks with 34 cities in nine U.S. markets to expand its 1 gigabit-per-second Internet service. Google is already building out fiber-optic networks in Kansas City, Mo.; Austin, Texas; and Provo, Utah. The company says it's in talks with government officials in Portland, Ore.; San Jose, Calif.; Salt Lake City; Phoenix; San Antonio; Nashville, Tenn.; Atlanta; and North Carolina's Charlotte and Raleigh/Durham.None of Google's proposed or already built-out markets include areas where East Coast-based Verizon sells its FiOS broadband and TV service via a high-speed broadband network.Another potential partner for Google could be Globalstar Telecommunications, which is seeking regulatory approval to use 2.4GHz spectrum for a large-scale urban Wi-Fi network, says Stephen Sweeney, an analyst at institutional broker-dealer Elevation.

2816,EBAY,"As the old saying goes, ""Everything should be in moderation."" Yes, it is OK to eat greasy bacon or indulge in slice after slice of cheesecake once in a while. But too much can become a problem.In the stock market, companies with hot products and services or savvy management often get their time on the TV screen, in flashy magazines or touted on different websites. Some coverage is fine, as this gets the word out and encourages investors to learn about the company's offerings and prospects, making for more potential shareholders.But too much media attention can be a sell signal, especially if it coincides with climax tops or other topping action in a stock. At the very least, it can be a warning to not get complacent.When just about every magazine and TV station are touting the greatness of a company's game-changing product or how much its stock has run up, or perhaps when a firm's CEO smiling face gets on the cover of a publication, it's time to get defensive. Hunt for key sell signals by using daily and weekly stock charts.There can be lofty levels of media attention on the entire stock market as well. If every guest on news programs is forecasting Dow 100K, it's time to get cautious. Too much media attention suggests that everyone who wants to be in the market or in an individual stock is already in. There are no investors left to buy, which becomes a dangerous situation. Good times are likely over.Unfortunate CoversMeg Whitman, former chief executive of eBay (EBAY), graced the cover of Fortune on Oct. 18, 2004. By the time that happened, eBay stock has already nearly quadrupled from a breakout two years earlier. The online auction giant topped in December 2004 and was nearly cut in half over the next four months.More recently, Lululemon Athletica (LULU) had a monster run since hitting a low of 2.17 in March 2009. From June to September 2010, the yoga and athletic clothing retailer formed a double-bottom base. A breakout past a 21.73 entry, adjusted for a 2-for-1 split in July 2011, led to a 273% gain to an 81.09 peak in May 2012 (1).In March, two months earlier, analysts on CNBC continued to pound the table on the stock. Yet Lululemon began sliding sharply below its 10-week moving average and spent a year moving sideways. The stock touched a new high in early May of this year (2), but good times didn't last.

2853,EBAY,"With fourth-quarter earnings season nearly over, it's time to look forward. Today's IBD 50 list includes Facebook (FB), Qihoo 360 Technology (QIHU) and two other companies that analysts project will report superior earnings per share growth for the current quarter.The IBD 50 list ranks the best stocks, strongest stocks first.Here are the top four IBD 50 stocks by estimated EPS growth this quarter: Qihoo 360, Kapstone Paper & Packaging (KS), Ubiquiti Networks (UBNT) and Facebook (FB).Qihoo 360, a Chinese security software provider, has been bulking up on gaming and search technology — both via acquisitions and internal development. It's challenging top Chinese search provider Baidu (BIDU), sometimes called China's Google (GOOG). Qihoo now has roughly 25% of China's search market, while Baidu has 58%.Qihoo 360 crushed fourth-quarter estimates on March 6 and issued bullish guidance. Analysts expect current-quarter EPS to soar 136%. Shares eased 1% in Friday's stock market trading.Paper goods maker Kapstone, the only non-tech company in the top 4, is growing rapidly, partly on its association with high tech. As the volume of online purchases from Amazon.com (AMZN), eBay (EBAY) and others ramps up, Kapstone provides packaging to ship those goods around the world.It carries a best-possible 99 IBD Composite Rating, meaning it's outperformed 99% of all stocks on key metrics such as sales and profit growth in recent quarters. Analysts project a 114% EPS rise this quarter.San Jose, Calif.-based Ubiquiti Networks makes radios, antennas and other gear for radio frequency, or RF, service providers. Ubiquiti grew rapidly last year selling its wireless network products to large companies and underserved rural Internet service providers (ISPs) around the globe.Ubiquiti says its goal is ""closing the digital divide by building network communication platforms for everyone and everywhere."" Analysts forecast 104% EPS growth.Facebook went public in May 2012 at 45 a share. It skidded to a 17.55 intraday low in early September 2012, then turned upward and never looked back. It continues to add apps, expand ad sales and add new users to more than 1 billion current viewers. Consensus is for a 100% surge in EPS this quarter.Facebook's stock, the only one of the top four that's also on the proprietary IBD Leaderboard list of top-rated stocks near a buy point, rose fractionally Friday.Related:Qihoo, YY Among 5 Recent IPOs With Top FundamentalsIBD 50: Despite Weak Market, Some Names SoarFollow James DeTar on Twitter: @IBD_JDeTar

2967,EBAY,"2013: A Look Back And AheadBob Swan has been eBay's chief financial officer since 2006, overseeing the numbers end of the San Jose, Calif.-based company at a time when it's reinventing itself as a hot spot for innovation and a global marketplace for both online and offline business.Swan is responsible for all aspects of eBay's (EBAY) finances, including operations such as mergers and acquisitions and investor relations. He joined eBay from Electronic Data Systems, where he also served as CFO.Swan says the payments, e-commerce and online auction player will target emerging markets and continue its innovative push and efforts to straddle online and offline transactions. He spoke with IBD about eBay's 2013 strategic focus:IBD: Will eBay keep making changes to its platform in 2013 to aid its Marketplace (auction and e-commerce) unit?Swan: The overall retail digital landscape is changing fairly dramatically, so we have every intention of pursuing innovation in our industry and extending the role we play. If I were to isolate the specific areas that are extremely important to us as we try to essentially bring the world's inventory to the world's consumers, we would like to continue to strengthen personalization and relevancy for consumers shopping on the eBay platform.Secondly, we have an extremely global footprint, but we're not very big in the emerging markets. How we use our global supply to reach consumers in the faster-growing emerging markets will be increasingly important and a big priority for our business.And third is mobility — we are a leading player in the mobile space and we intend to continue to (develop) eBay Mobile to make it easier for consumers to access the world's inventory. It's a fast-changing industry that we're operating in and we will continue to innovate out in front of it and help our merchants to reach consumers around the world.IBD: What innovations will eBay focus on in the global marketplace?Swan: The innovation is across our portfolio. Let's talk about eBay. Within our Marketplace unit, obviously we'll be helping shoppers (who use computers) by continuing to innovate and develop technologies that will help make that connection easier.In (transaction services) PayPal, we continue to take the PayPal wallet and what it meant for both merchants and consumers in the online world, (and) innovate and bring more functionality to that wallet as we migrate into the offline world.And at GSI Commerce (which develops and runs online shopping sites for brick-and-mortar brands and retailers), the technologies are highly contingent to make retailers and brands effectively compete and win in a world where multichannel and mobile devices have made life between online and offline blur.Consumers may want to shop online or offline and may want to have an item delivered to their home or they may want to order it online and pick it up at the store. GSI builds and innovates on those technologies to make it easier for retailers and merchants to win.IBD: Will mobile innovations like retail ""dongle"" swipes , which let shoppers use their cellphones to make purchase transactions, and the move to more such offline transactions continue to be key drivers for the company? How?Swan: This is another example where mobile has dramatically blurred the lines between the online and offline world. For us, what that means is that PayPal historically had been simply a way to pay on eBay. Today, it's the way to pay online. Dongles are a way to take our technology and user base and migrate that into the offline world to make it easy for the consumer to use their mobile or global wallet in the cloud to conduct transactions in the offline world.Whether they're large retailers or small retailers, we have taken steps to enable consumers to use PayPal's functionality in the offline world. That's a new market for us where we've spent a lot of time and energy to position ourselves to be the winner, not just in online payments, but to also position ourselves in the offline world. The dongle is a technology, a device that enables us to do that.IBD: Do you see further changes in consumer and business customer behavior, driven by mobile, in 2013 that will affect eBay?Swan: At the most radical level, the biggest change is that consumers today have the ability to shop anytime, anywhere, for anything around the globe. The consumer has the ability to do this given mobile devices and today's technology. So in that world, we have been invested in mobile to make that easy for the last several years. And this year, we will do over $10 billion in volume on eBay Marketplaces and over $10 billion in volume on PayPal because of the innovations we've been making in mobile to capitalize on these emerging trends.In 2013, mobile is here to stay and mobile devices as a way to make consumer lives easier is clearly here to stay. We will use that technology to create more shoppable experiences and moments for the consumer by enabling them to access technology at the tip of their fingers to conduct more commerce in an easier and simpler way. We will build the capability on eBay with PayPal and with GSI clients to help them capitalize on mobile technologies.IBD: What is PayPal's main strategy in 2013?Swan: PayPal's business has evolved dramatically in a relatively short time ago, from being the way to pay on eBay to today where it's more the way to pay online with well over 50% of PayPal's volume coming across eBay from merchants all around the world. You can expect us to continue to innovate on behalf of merchants and consumers to grow our share of the overall e-commerce landscape and to find new functionalities like our instant credit offering to help increase conversion for merchants.So in the online world, you can expect us to continue to innovate about the relevancy of the functionality of the wallet to increase consumer adoption.In addition to that, (we're asking) how do we take our online technology capabilities and our user interface and what PayPal stands for for both merchants and consumers and leverage that technology to migrate into the offline world.EBay's focus was e-commerce primarily for small and medium-sized merchants, but in a relatively short time it's shifted to enabling e-commerce for merchants of all sizes and all regions of the world. So the magnitude of our market for eBay Inc. and all three of its businesses (Marketplace, PayPal and GSI) has dramatically changed.There are strategies across the portfolio and the technologies and innovations that will enable us to capitalize on a dramatically larger market.

3012,EBAY,"2013: A Look Back And AheadSometimes, slow and steady really do win the race.EBay (EBAY) is among the top big-cap stock winners this year, trudging steadily up its 10-week moving average to a gain of as much as 75% this year.Stocks that join IBD Big Cap 20 (featured every Tuesday) typically move more slowly than their high-growth counterparts. It can take them a long time to form a base, but they tend to be less volatile. That's because their high market capitalization — at least $15 billion, according to IBD's definition — makes them less sensitive to high-volume trading.Meanwhile, growth stocks offer the possibility of strong returns during a market uptrend. In many respects, EBay has offered investors the best of both worlds — steady capital gains without as much risk.EBay satisfies the N requirement of IBD's CAN SLIM method for choosing the best high-growth stocks. The N stands for newness — new company, new management, new products.EBay is no longer just an auction website but a full-fledged retailer that allows consumers to comparison-shop online and make purchases electronically via PayPal, which eBay purchased in 2002.EBay's base showed tight trading following a series of wild, high-volume swings during much of 2011. But it settled down late that year and in early 2012.The stock's first base of the year offered an early entry on Feb. 2, 2012, when it cleared a 32.55 cup-with-handle buy point. (1) But weak volume made it risky to buy at that time. The main breakout came a couple weeks later. (2) A daily chart shows strong volume kicking in on Feb. 15 to 17.As the stock approached its buy point, its Relative Strength line started to rise and its Accumulation-Distribution rating stood at B, indicating growing demand for shares.EBay's fundamentals were also bullish. Profit in the three quarters leading up to the breakout grew at a solid double-digit pace as EBay continued to rebound from a series of earnings declines during the 2008-09 recession. Revenue growth was also strong leading up to and through the breakout.EBay's Earnings Per Share rating at the time was a respectable 84, and it enjoyed an SMR rating of A, indicating superior sales growth, profit margins and return on equity.The stock then formed a three-weeks-tight pattern with a 36.90 entry in the week ended March 9, (3) offering shareholders a chance to add to their positions.For much of the year, EBay continued to trade in mostly tight fashion while hewing close to its 10-week line.

3045,EBAY,"The stock market can at first be a disappointing place for those who seek symmetry and balance.A double-bottom base is a pattern that only occasionally sketches a proportionate design. Unlike cup-with-handle and flat bases, double-bottoms are often distorted and difficult to recognize.The base is roughly a ""W,"" with the buy point plotted a dime above the center peak. The right lobe should at least slightly undercut the left, signaling a second, hopefully a last, shakeout of low-conviction investors.When the stock rebounds up the right side of the W, past the center-point pivot, it's breakout time. On the occasions when the base's right side mirrors the left, they may be signaling a stock ready to make a serious run.Cisco Systems (CSCO) and eBay (EBAY) are among the stocks to have launched out of double bottoms early in their advances.More recently, Facebook (FB) formed a double-bottom base stretching from February through mid-July. It was an easy base to miss.The stock had plummeted after its IPO, disappointing investors and launching a series of lawsuits over the company's pricing of its IPO.The stock swung down into a deep, nine-month cup-with-handle base. It cleared the buy point by pennies, then reversed to begin building its double-bottom base.Most investors were soured and not looking for a base. But those who had their eyes open saw the stock build a first lobe 13 weeks long. The second, 11 weeks.The base was preceded by a healthy 85% rise. The structure had two primary flaws: It formed largely below its 10-week moving average, and deeply below its 52-week high. It had retaken and narrowly held support at its 10-week line for two weeks prior to the breakout.On July 25, Facebook reported a huge second-quarter earnings beat on a much larger than expected surge in mobile ad sales. The 58% profit increase on a 53% jump in revenue showed acceleration vs. the first quarter.The stock cleared not only the 29.17 buy point with a massive gap-up move, it cleared the entire base. Shares rose more than 20% to trigger the eight-week hold rule within three days. In nine weeks, it had cleared its IPO day best and moved on to new high ground.

"
3053,EBAY,"Key elements of the proposed standard include new data fields to provide richer information about the transaction, which can help improve fraud detection and expedite the approval process. It would also require consistent methods to identify and verify a consumer before replacing the traditional card account number with a token, and a common standard to simplify the process for merchants for contactless, online or other transactions.

3140,EBAY,"The Supreme Court on Jun 21 ruled that states have the right to collect sales tax from online purchases even if a company doesn’t have any physical presence in that state. This certainly is a game-changing decision given that businesses, primarily online retailers, so long were not bound to collect sales tax in states where they do not operate physically.The Supreme Court ruling has been cheered by brick-and-mortar stores, which have been struggling to survive the e-commerce onslaught. That said, many online retailers are already collecting sales tax on their products in different states. Given this scenario, it needs to be seen, how big a pinch e-commerce companies would feel now.Online Retail Hits RoadblockThe Supreme Court on Thursday ruled that states can collect sales tax on online purchases, overturning a 1992 decision that traditional retailers so long complained was putting them at disadvantageous position compared with online competitors. Although retailers with a physical presence were required to collect sales tax, it wasn’t binding on online retailers and upstarts, which would often skip it, thus making their products look cheaper.The latest ruling definitely will bring relief for brick-and-mortar stores, which are striving to compete with e-commerce companies. The new ruling saw shares of traditional retailers jump immediately. Shares of Walmart, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) and Dollar General Corporation (DG  -  Free Report) increased 0.7% each, while Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) jumped 1%.On the other hand and quite predictably, shares of online retailers like Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report), eBay, Inc. (EBAY  -  Free Report) and Etsy, Inc. (ETSY  -  Free Report) slid 1.1%, 3.2% and 0.6%, respectively. Amazon has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Amazon is Still SafeAmazon took advantage of the law for years and refrained from collecting sales tax on its book sales and then other products for years. This made the company’s products look cheaper and was one of the key factors behind turning the fortunes of the company, which is now an e-commerce behemoth.However, Amazon started collecting sales tax in all states since Apr 2017. Hence, it might not pinch the company much. That said, more than 50% of Amazon’s sales are from third party marketplace sellers, who often don’t collect sales tax. This is one area which might hurt Amazon, as with sales tax, the price of the products is likely to increase.Other Online Retailers to Feel the HeatAmazon may have started collecting sales tax but it’s the other small and medium-size online retailers that have been pushed to an uncomfortable corner with the new ruling. Companies like eBay, Etsy and Wayfair Inc. (W  -  Free Report) will now need to collect sales tax on the products they sell, which they so long had been avoiding.Online furniture company, Wayfair, saw its shares fall 1.6% immediately after the ruling was passed. Online home furnishing and products retailer Overstock, Inc. (OSTK  -  Free Report) saw its shares plummeting as much as 7.2%, while Shopify Inc. (SHOP  -  Free Report) declined 4.5%. Understandably, the new ruling is likely to affect small and medium sized online retailers more, particularly those with no physical presence at all, as they had so long been giving stiff competition to brick-and-mortar stores by charging less for their products.Level-Playing Ground for Traditional Retailers  Brick-and-mortar stores have been long ruing that an absence of sales tax on online sales put them at a disadvantage. However, the new ruling will definitely give them a level playing ground. Moreover, traditional retailers like Walmart, Target and The Kroger Company (KR  -  Free Report) that are increasingly shifting focus toward online, collect sales tax for products sold online.However, much like Amazon, they too don’t collect sales tax on goods sold by third parties on their platform. That said, online sales still make for a very small portion of the revenues for most traditional retailers. Walmart gets generates only 3% of its revenues online in the United States.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?

3141,EBAY,"The dynamic of online retail has been turned upside down thanks to a Supreme Court ruling made earlier today. From now on, states can now compel online retailers to collect taxes from their consumers even if they don’t have a physical presence in the state.Over the years, only brick-and-mortar stores were required to collect taxes on states’ behalf. On the other hand, online retailers were not required of this action, until now. The consumers who would online shop were solely responsible for paying the necessary state taxes, which never really happened. This has caused states to lose millions of dollars over the years and gave online retail an advantage over their brick-and-mortar competitors.According to CNN, the Supreme Court reversed the 1992 ruling that allowed states to impose taxes on only brick-and-mortar businesses within the state. The court believed that this specific law allowed businesses to avoid a physical presence in states. Ultimately, the justices agreed that the current laws were outdated. This led to a 5-4 decision, which has left online retailers in the tech and consumer services industry experiencing a downfall in their share prices.Shortly after the decision was made, shares of Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) fell 1.2%, and other online retailers like eBay (EBAY  -  Free Report), Etsy (ETSY  -  Free Report) and Wayfair (W  -  Free Report) were down 1.8%, 4.7%, and 2.7%, respectively, as well. Since Amazon is already a large enough online retailer, it has been collecting taxes from its consumers before this ruling. However, it could potentially harm smaller businesses.Seeing as prices are already falling, we can expect online retail to become more expensive. This could potentially lead to fewer customers using online retail and in return, lead them back to shopping locally for stuff like furniture, electronics and jewelry. According to Sucharita Kodali, a retail analyst with Forrester, she called the ruling “bad news” for online retail. The Internet has become the go-to place for many consumers, whether it is for basic necessities or even grocery shopping, people like to do it remotely.According to a study done by Pew Research Center in 2016, 8/10 Americans are online shoppers. When Pew Research Center first came about in 2000, only 22% of Americans used online retail. In 16 years, the Internet and e-commerce has become a staple in an average American’s shopping life.Not only does this ruling greatly affect online retailers, but brick-and-mortars are celebrating. According to cnet, the National Retail Federation called the decision a major victory, which they have been awaiting for the past two decades. Matthew Shay, the CEO and Federation’s president, said that this ruling makes way for a fair and level playing field between all retailers, whether it is online or in-store. As of now, online retailers have been pushed into a sink hole, whereas brick-and-mortar shops are way above the ground. With this recent ruling, the future of online retail is uncertain, and has divided the retail industry, both online and physically.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

In the last quarter, Red Hat delivered positive earnings surprise of 13.75%.Earnings jumped 49.2% on a year-over-year basis, primarily driven by strong top-line growth and operating margin expansion.Revenues increased 22.8% year over year to almost $772.3 million, primarily on the back of strong demand for hybrid cloud solutions as well as aggressive cross-selling.

Management expects the expanding partner base to drive 80% of new bookings in the near term.Additionally, complementary acquisitions have led to a favorable product mix, which is, in turn, bolstering overall results.The company’s strategy of making acquisitions (CoreOS, Permabit, Codenvy, 3scale, Ansible, FeedHenry, eNovance, Inktank, Codenvy) that can be easily integrated into current business has expanded its product portfolio into higher-growth segments, such as Hybrid cloud and other emerging technologies (Cloud Management, OpenShift, OpenStack, and Storage).OpenShift continues to gain traction, which is a key catalyst for the soon-to-be reported quarter. Another driving force for the quarter is Red Hat’s dominance in containerized application development.For the first quarter of fiscal 2019, Red Hat expects revenues between $800 million and $810 million.

3143,EBAY,"Micron Technology Inc. (MU  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Jun 20. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether or not this memory chip maker will be able to continue its impressive performance in the quarter.Notably, Micron has delivered positive earnings surprises for 10 straight quarters. Over the trailing four quarters, the company delivered an average positive surprise of 8%. So, let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.As long as memory chip prices and demand continue to rise, Micron is likely to keep benefiting. The ongoing investigation by the Chinese government on allegations that Micron, along with Samsung and SK Hynix, indulged in fixing memory prices, is unlikely to conclude any time soon. This lowers the possibility of any negative impact on demand and prices in the near term.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Micron is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. Per our model, a stock with a positive Earnings ESP, and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold), has higher chances of beating estimates. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Micron currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 but has an Earnings ESP of +0.00%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.However, the stock is likely to register massive year-over-year growth on both the counts, i.e. revenues and earnings per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal third-quarter’s earnings is pegged at $3.14, which is 93.8% higher than the year-ago quarter’s reported earnings of $1.62. Additionally, analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly $7.70 billion, up 38.3% from the prior-year quarter tally.Micron Technology, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Micron Technology, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Micron Technology, Inc. Quote Let’s see what’s driving this overwhelming expectation.DRAMs to Continue Driving RevenuesMicron has been the key beneficiary of the upswing in DRAM prices and strong demand which was triggered in the second half of calendar-year 2016. DRAM, which is one of Micron’s biggest revenue contributing segment (71% of 2Q18 revenues), is likely to deliver better numbers, given a supply shortage and increasing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) at datacenters. This should further drive demand for DRAMs. Notably, AI-enabled servers require five to six times the capacity of regular DRAMs compared to standard cloud servers.Going ahead, rising demand for DRAMs from autonomous vehicle manufacturers is expected to have aided the company’s to-be-reported quarterly results. Self-driving vehicles need to make real-time decisions by analyzing large amounts of data, which necessitates the use of high-performance DRAMs.Declining NAND Prices to Partially Mute Top-Line GrowthIn the last fiscal, the company witnessed impressive growth in NAND revenues due to the massive demand-supply gap which escalated chip prices. Nonetheless, we expect this segment’s growth rate to have remained moderate in the fiscal third quarter as the supply-demand gap has narrowed down significantly, according to various research firms, which is affecting chip prices adversely.Notably, in the fiscal second quarter, Micron witnessed a low-double-digit rise in bit shipments, while average selling price (ASP) declined in the mid-teens range. Therefore, looking at the current scenario, we believe decline in ASP will have negatively impacted the company’s NAND revenues and margins, and somewhat offset the benefits from improved demand and prices for DRAM products.Some Stocks With Favorable CombinationsHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Seagate Technology Plc (STX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.77% and flaunts a Zacks Rank of 1.Juniper Networks, Inc. (JNPR  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +3.54% and carries a Zacks Rank of 3.eBay Inc.

3144,EBAY,"eBay Inc. (EBAY  -  Free Report) has joined forces with Noon, an e-commerce venture to sell products online via noon.com. Notably, Dubai billionaire, Mohammed Alabbar, is the founder of the e-commerce venture.The latest move will aid eBay in expanding its business in the e-commerce market of Middle East. This is in sync with the company’s aim of global expansion.This partnership will benefit the customers of Saudi Arabia and UAE as they will have access to products available outside their native countries, consequently, enriching the shopping experience. In fact, eBay will make products from the United States and other countries available on noon.com and its shopping app.We believe the availability of a wide variety of products will attract customers to the platform and drive the sales of eBay. Further, the possibility of seizing the market share rises with the increase in the number of products available.Coming to the price performance, shares of eBay have returned 17.2% over a year, underperforming the industry’s rally of 50.2%. Middle East Market Holds PromiseThe e-commerce market in Middle East is growing at a rapid speed and is expected to expand further in future due to the increasing use of internet and smartphone. Furthermore, improving infrastructure remains a key factor for growth of this particular market.With the rapidly growing online retail markets in gulf countries like UAE and Saudi Arabia, the Middle East region holds great potential for growth of the e-commerce companies.Per the latest data from Research and Markets, the online retail sales in the gulf countries are expected to double by 2020. Moreover, the UAE market is anticipated to grow at an annual rate exceeding 20% till 2021.According to reports from Statista, revenues in Saudi Arabian e-commerce market are anticipated to grow at a CAGR of 11.3% between 2018 and 2022, and reach $9.4 billion by 2022.

Speculations are rife that Alibaba (BABA  -  Free Report) has also been trying to make acquisitions in the Middle East region. The company’s Aliespress.com is already operating in this region.Consequently, eBay is likely to sustain momentum in this competitive market by partnering with Noon.Zacks Rank & Stock to ConsiderCurrently, eBay carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock that can be considered in the retail-wholesale sector is Expedia (EXPE  -  Free Report) which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

3145,EBAY,"Come Jul 16 and Amazon.com, Inc.’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) Prime Day begins. Naturally, much like millions of shoppers, the e-commerce giant too will be waiting with bated breath for the shopping extravaganza to start. After all, Prime Day means a lot to Amazon. However, it’s not only Amazon that makes a lot from Prime Day. Amazon in a way is also helping its rivals like Walmart Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report), Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report), eBay, Inc. (EBAY  -  Free Report) and Macy’s, Inc. (M  -  Free Report) to cash in on this opportunity.From brick-and-mortar stores to e-commerce companies, Amazon’s rivals are trying to make the most of Prime Day with a host of offers. Amazon, which has changed the entire retail landscape in the last few years, is once again proving to be a big influencer in driving retail sales.Amazon Shows the WayLaunched in 2015, Prime Day has proved to be Amazon’s biggest money churning machine. And the e-commerce giant isn’t leaving any stone unturned to reach out to more shoppers this time too. In doing so, it has extended Prime Day to a 36-hour online deal, including offers at Whole Foods, expansion to four new countries and surprise events in five cities.Understandably, extending Prime Day by six hours is in a move to attract more customers. This certainly will boost Amazon’s sales, as Prime members will have the option to choose form as much as one million items this time.The company expects Prime Day to generate $3.4 billion in sales worldwide compared with $2.4 billion in 2017. In fact, so successful was Prime Day last year that it even outpaced Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Amazon has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Amazon had started Prime Day as a bulk clearance sale but its success turned it into a global shopping event. This certainly has changed the way people have so long shopped. Today, shoppers eagerly wait for Prime Day.Prime Day Helps Amazon’s RivalsAmazon has changed the entire retail ballgame in the last few years. This has made its rivals change focus toward online retail. Prime Day, on the other hand, has emerged as one of the most attractive shopping extravaganzas in its event calendar. However, in turning Prime Day into a mega shopping affair, Amazon in a way is helping its rivals.From brick-and-mortar giants to e-commerce companies, today everyone is offering discounts around Prime Day. One of the major beneficiaries is Amazon’s closest rival Walmart, which is offering its new customers a discount of $10 on about three different orders using the code, ""WALMART3"" on pickups of $50 or higher till Jul 31. Moreover, Walmart will also be giving 3% cash back to credit card holders for any grocery pickup service from its stores.Also, Target has entered into a partnership with membership-based grocery service provider, Shipt, for same-day delivery. Similarly, eBay too will be coming up with a wide range of deals starting Jul 16.It goes without saying that Amazon’s rivals are fast trying to catch up. Prime Day has certainly proved to be one of the biggest events for Amazon. So has it for the likes of Walmart, Target and eBay, which are trying to lure more customers with similar deals and discounts. Moreover, Amazon’s competitors also have a certain advantage, as Prime Day can be enjoyed only by Prime members, while most of its rivals are keeping their offers open to everyone.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

3146,EBAY,"The Indian retail e-commerce market which is dominated by Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Flipkart at the moment holds immense potential. In fact, both the companies are trying to put their best foot forward in a bid to gain further traction in this prospective market. Both the companies are employing aggressive retail strategies, expanding seller base and distribution strength to get an edge over the other.However, Mukesh Ambani, chairman of Reliance Industries, has put a spanner in the works with his plans of developing an e-commerce platform by combining Reliance Retail and Reliance Jio Infocomm, in a bid to bolster the presence of Reliance in the market.This initiative of Ambani is likely to pose serious threat to the dominant players as well as the other e-commerce giants which are yet to establish themselves namely Alibaba (BABA  -  Free Report) and eBay (EBAY  -  Free Report).Further, the platform will be based on online-to-offline (O2O) marketing program, which will aid in attracting customers online and allowing them to shop via offline channels. Consequently, the hybrid model bodes well for the interests of domestic brick-and-mortar stores as these will get a platform to showcase their products online, bolstering their sales numbers.Additionally, this is likely to benefit the traditional Indian buyers who account for a significant share in the total Indian population and are hesitant to shop online due to issues regarding product quality.India Holds PromisePer the latest data from eMarketer, the sales figure in the e-commerce market of India is expected to reach $72 billion by 2022 from $32.7 billion in 2018.The country is currently witnessing a digital explosion on the back of increasing penetration of smartphone and Internet. Notably, this trend was aided significantly by the initiatives of Reliance Jio.According to the report from India Brand Equity Foundation, online shopping in the country is expected to reach $135.8 billion in 2018, surging 31% on a year-over-year basis.Consequently, India remains a strong market for e-commerce businesses and a lucrative one for foreign and domestic investors alike.Reliance Entry Intensifies CompetitionWe believe the entry of Reliance in the Indian e-commerce space will intensify the competition, which is likely to impact the shares of Amazon and Flipkart.Amazon’s market share came in 44% as of April 2018, consequently maintaining its dominant position. Meanwhile, Flipkart accounted for 40% of the market share. Further, the monthly active users (MAU) of Amazon grew 40% while Flipkart witnessed growth of 30%.Additionally, per the recent Citi Research report, Amazon is well poised to reap benefits from this growing market. The company is anticipated to generate more than $10 billion in revenues and nearly $1.5 billion of free cash flow by growing 23% annually till 2027.Additionally, Amazon India is currently valued at $16 billion while Flipkart is valued at $20-$22 billion due to the Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report) deal.We note that these growth prospects are likely to suffer due to the growing number of potential entrants into the market.Amazon.com, Inc. Revenue (TTM) Amazon.com, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Amazon.com, Inc. QuoteE-Commerce Investments to Get HurtIndian e-commerce space’s invitation to Reliance does not bode well for the increasing investments of global retail and e-commerce giants in this market.The retail giant Walmart has recently entered into a definitive agreement to acquire majority stake of 77% in Flipkart for $16 billion. This marks as one of the world’s largest e-commerce deals.Additionally, Alibaba has invested $200 million in India’s Paytm Mall which is similar to its TMall. It has also invested in online ticketing platform, TicketNew. Further, it is planning to invest $250-$300 million in online grocer, Bigbasket and its payments affiliate Ant Financial has agreed to invest in food-ordering app Zomato.Further, eBay has recently announced its plans to relaunch its Indian division, eBay India by selling its stake in Flipkart to Walmart. eBay India aims to start cross-border trade in India via its online platform which will benefit both Indian sellers and buyers.Nevertheless, Amazon India has issued paid up capital of $2.7 billion toward Amazon Seller Services, its marketplace arm. Moreover, Amazon has almost 41 warehouses in India, a captive logistics unit and operates a payments arm. Currently, Amazon carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

(Eastern Time), Amazon’s Prime Day will last for 36 hours, more than last year’s 30 hours. This would be the longest Prime Day ever for Amazon since its start in 2015.The company is gearing up to offer at least one million deals including those on all the Whole Foods Market stores in the United States. Moreover, Amazon is also focused on exploring new markets beyond the United States. In this respect, it is wise to evaluate some of its competitors and they way they are preparing to counter Amazon’s assault.Walmart All Geared Up To Counter AmazonThe ""best Prime Day celebration,” is definitely good news for Amazon and a matter of worry for its competitors. However, one of Amazon’s major competitors, Walmart Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) is in no mood to sit back. In fact, new customers of Walmart will get a discount of $10 on about 3 different orders using the code, ""WALMART3"" on pickups of $50 or higher till Jul 31.Additionally, the company’s credit card holders will be subjected to cash back of 3% on any grocery pickup service from Walmart.

Also, from this month, shoppers are offered with curated collections. Walmart’s 3D shopping feature along with its curated collections is known as “Buy the Room.”Ebay, Target Prepared to CompeteAlso, like Amazon, eBay Inc. (EBAY  -  Free Report) announced on Jul 3 that it will offer ""thousands of exclusive deals"" starting Jul 16. It will be a weeklong affair and the best part is that no membership will required to avail these offers. “Hundreds of brands,” including Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. , Apple Inc. (AAPL) and adidas AG (ADDYY  -  Free Report) will be participating.Other big retail companies like The Kroger Co. (KR  -  Free Report) is also focused on competing with Amazon by investing heavily in automated warehouses. Further, Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) has gone into a partnership with membership-based grocery service provider, Shipt.The main focus of the partnership is to provide customers faster delivery, which is on the same day. Also, Target has offered a gift card of $5, when customers buy select household essentials for $25 or higher.Summing UpAmazon’s Longest Ever Prime Day is definitely going to bring a lot of good news for the company. Additionally, the overall retail industry will also remain busy as several other key players like Walmart, Ebay, Kroger and Target have their guns blazing to compete with Amazon. In this respect, this year is truly going to be one of the biggest ever for the retail market.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

3148,EBAY,"Spoiler Alert:  The answer is Yes and No.In the not-so-distant past, U.S. companies who’s share prices were growing would regularly “split” their shares to bring the price lower and more affordable for individual investors. In reality, the value of a company that votes to split the shares remains exactly the same – there are simply twice as many shares at half the price – the market capitalization remains unchanged.Investors have generally cheered stock splits in shares they owned, taking it as a sign of strength (the shares must have upward momentum for a split to occur) and a bullish outlook for the future – there was a well-founded perception that companies that had split would continue to rally.There’s also a psychological concept at play. Investors now owned more shares. It’s certainly encouraging to look at a brokerage statement as 100 shares turns into 200, then 200 turns into 400 and so forth.  Because splits generally occurred only when the shares were rising in value, investors came to associate splits with strong price performance.There was also a practical reason to split.  Until the early 1970’s, stock trades happened in-person between parties on the floor of an exchange and trading in odd numbers of shares complicated the process. Professionals preferred to deal in “round lots” of 100 shares – or multiples of 100 shares – for expediency.  The advent of the Nasdaq didn’t change this much, because although quotes were displayed electronically, the process was still heavily dependent on human input from traders and back-office personnel and round-lots were still the norm.The past 20 years or so have brought an explosion in the number of venues on which shares could be traded and virtually all stock trades are now executed and cleared electronically. There’s no longer any compelling reason why trading 32 shares or 1,361 shares is any less convenient than trading in multiples of 100.The Beginning of the End for SplitsNot surprisingly, the first stock to rise to 4-digit and then 5-digit share prices without splitting was Warren Buffet’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A). Buffet, ever the pragmatist, correctly believes that a stock split is an artificial convention that has no actual effect on the true value of the holding. Buffet also encourages investors to think long-term (really long-term, actually) and undertaking a change that allows investors to trade into and out of the stock more frequently runs counter to his buy-and-hold Value approach.(Note: Even Berkshire eventually introduced a B-class share with a lower price that is functionally identical to the more expensive A-shares, but allows smaller investors a less expensive ownership option. This was also done in part to compensate small investors in Burlington Northern Railroad after a stock buyout.)Price Weighted IndexesOne final consideration about stock splits - for a small number of companies who are large enough - is for inclusion in the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index which is price weighted.  The S&P 500, Nasdaq 100 and Russell 2000 indexes are all capitalization weighted, so the relative weights of stocks in the index and their daily contribution to the index price calculation are all based on market cap and independent of the number of shares outstanding.  The Dow however is calculated using the actual price of shares, so a $200 stock that moves 1% will have double the impact on the index price as a $100 stock with twice as many shares outstanding that makes the same percentage move, even though the change in market cap is identical. Companies aiming at being included in the Dow will sometimes split their shares to achieve a lower stock price that will not immediately have an outsized effect in index price moves.  Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) performed a 7-for-1 split in 2014 primarily for this purpose.Amazon Valuation MetricsAt its current share price of $1,624 Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) is the fifth highest priced stock in the U.S. and its market cap of $783B makes it the second most valuable company overall – behind only Apple.  If the high stock price is not an indication of a truly high price, what does a more traditional valuation method tell us about Amazon’s stock price?At $1624, Amazon is trading at a 12-month forward P/E ratio of 133X. This is still much higher than similar companies like Chinese e-retailer Alibaba (BABA  -  Free Report) at 37X, the Retail Sector as a whole at 25X and Ebay (EBAY  -  Free Report) at 20X.With accelerating analyst estimates for 2018 earnings, Amazon is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).So obviously investors are willing to pay a sizeable premium for Amazon over its competitors, presumably because of expectations for continued growth. Throughout its history, Amazon has relentlessly expanded its offerings of goods and services, often at the expense of current earnings.  The strategy has worked extremely well so far (with a few notable misses – do you know anyone who uses an “Amazon Phone”?). Amazon sales represented 44% of e-commerce sales in 2017. No other large business owns that type of market share, not even Samsung or Apple in smartphones with 23% and 16%, respectively.Because Amazon spends so heavily to continue expanding, Price to Sales is a somewhat more valuable measure to compare it to its peers, and here things start to look a little more standard. With $178B in revenues in 2017, Amazon has a Price/Sales ratio of 4.1X, lower than Alibaba at 14X, and similar to Ebay at 3.9X, but still considerably higher than the retail sector as a whole at 1.1X.The gap in valuation shrinks, but still shows extremely high expectations for future growth.  ConclusionYes, Amazon is a very expensive stock based on both share price and P/E ratio and still a fairly expensive stock on Price to Sales, all based on expectations for future growth. It’s often said that a stock is “priced for perfection”, though that’s not really the case for Amazon, as buyers seem willing to overlook periodic results in favor of focusing on long-term growth potential. (Note the chart above to see that Amazon stock has marched steadily upward through earnings beats and misses.) It would be more accurate to say that Amazon is “priced for trajectory” and as the second most valuable company in history, it shows no signs of slowing down now.   Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies  It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

3149,EBAY,"Welcome to the latest episode of the Full-Court Finance podcast from Zacks Investment Research. On this week’s episode, Ben Rains discusses the NFL’s new national anthem policy and breaks down everything investors and sports fans need to know about e-commerce power Fanatics after the company’s new NFL and Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) deal.  The NFL’s ratings have declined across NBC (CMCSA  -  Free Report), CBS (CBS  -  Free Report), Fox , and ESPN (DIS  -  Free Report) over the last two seasons. But while many have pointed to the growing popularity of streaming services, such as Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) and new NFL partner Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), along with cord-cutting as major reasons for the league’s poor ratings, others have blamed the controversy surrounding the national anthem. This prompted the NFL’s owners and Roger Goodell to adopt a new policy, starting this upcoming season.“This season, all league and team personnel shall stand and show respect for the flag and the Anthem,” the NFL wrote in an official statement. “Personnel who choose not to stand for the Anthem may stay in the locker room until after the Anthem has been performed.”This move is sure to become a point of controversy in the coming months, and will likely linger throughout the entire 2018/19 season—which is the last thing the NFL really wants.Transitioning to a non-political NFL update, the league recently struck a new 10-year licensing deal with Fanatics. The multibillion-dollar e-commerce powerhouse will soon manufacture and distribute all non-player NFL gear for adults.Nike’s logo will still appear on all official NFL gear and the sportswear giant will also outfit all of the players. But the new deal is part of growing trend. The NFL, like many others, wants a more streamlined and insanely fast e-commerce business. This is where Fanatics and CEO Michael Rubin’s—who sold his last company to eBay (EBAY  -  Free Report) for $2.4 billion in 2011—end-to-end e-commerce strategy comes into play.Fanatics has made similar deals with Under Armour (UAA  -  Free Report) and MLB.

3150,EBAY,"The NBA Finals tip off Thursday night, pitting LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers against Steph Curry and the Golden State Warriors for the fourth straight season. The speculation and predictions have already begun, but let’s leave the guessing to the NBA experts and look instead at the NBA’s rapidly growing business.James, who is set to play for his eighth straight NBA title, Curry, and Kevin Durant are all global superstars. All three are some of the biggest names for some of the biggest sports apparel companies in the world, Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) for James and Durant, and Under Armour (UAA  -  Free Report) for Curry.The three biggest names in the NBA Finals are also successful pitchmen as well as investors, making millions on and off the court. On top of the success of these superstars, the NBA has become one of the most successful sports leagues in the world and its business has never been bigger.TV RatingsThe NBA saw its overall national TV ratings climb 8% from last season to hit 1.28 million, according to Nielsen. This uptick comes across the league’s four television-network partners: Disney’s (DIS  -  Free Report) ABC and ESPN, Turner’s  TNT, and NBA TV. The 2017/18 season also marked the NBA’s best overall ratings average since the 2013/14 season and stands in stark contrast to the NFL’s ratings decline.The league has also performed well on television throughout the playoffs. The struggling ESPN’s overall NBA playoff ratings were up 31% from 2017, with Game 7 of the Eastern Conference finals drawing 13.305 million viewers—which marked the second-largest total for an NBA game in ESPN history. Meanwhile, TNT’s coverage of the Western Conference finals climbed roughly 33%.These ratings will be fun to pay attention to throughout the NBA Finals as the league’s performance on television might have major implications for sponsorship partners and help determine the NBA’s negotiating power going forward.  Sponsors The NBA introduced for the first time this season jersey sponsorship patches, which allowed teams to negotiate their own deals with companies for the rights to a 2.5 inch by 2.5 inch patch on players’ left sleeves. In total, 21 out of the league’s 30 teams played with a patch during the first season, with notable teams from big markets, including the Chicago Bulls and Houston Rockets, taking the court without patches.With that said, the rest of the teams made some big money from deals. The average patch deal brought in roughly $6.5 million per year, and accounted for roughly $137 million of total sponsorship revenue, according to IEG/ESP.The recent influx of new revenue helped the NBA pull in $1.12 billion in total sponsorship money this season, which marked a 31% surge from the $861 million last season. It is also worth noting that the NBA rested just behind the NFL’s $1.25 billion.General Electric (GE  -  Free Report), Disney, Harley-Davidson (HOG  -  Free Report), Western Union (WU  -  Free Report), eBay (EBAY  -  Free Report)-owned StubHub, and Fitbit (FIT  -  Free Report) were just some of the notable jersey sponsors in the inaugural season. The two teams that face off in the NBA finals stand to help provide even more exposure for their corporate sponsors: Japanese electronics firm Rakuten RKUNY for the defending champion Warriors, and Goodyear (GT  -  Free Report) for its hometown Cavaliers.The 2018 NBA Finals mark another first for the NBA when it comes to boosting its top line, with Google’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) YouTube TV acting as the first-ever presenting sponsor for the NBA Finals. The YouTube TV logo will appear all over the place, including the official NBA Finals logo. Meanwhile, select markets are also expected to be able to watch ABC’s NBA Finals coverage on YouTube TV.Looking AheadFrom the NBA’s partnership with Take-Two Interactive and Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) Twitch on its new esports league to its active expansion in China and other growth markets, the NBA’s business looks poised to keep on booming.Going forward, these deals should help the NBA become even more popular and relevant as it fights to stay on the cutting-edge of content distribution and outside the box business ventures.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

3151,EBAY,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for eBay Inc. (EBAY  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 7.2% in that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is EBAY due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.eBay Q1 Earnings Match Estimates, Revenues MisseseBay Inc. first-quarter 2018 earnings matched the Zacks Consensus Estimate, while the revenues missed the same by a slight margin.

Also, in the past 12-months, the stock has gained 19.1% underperforming its industry’s growth of 42.4%.On the call, management sounded impressed with the progress of the company’s transformation and the positive response of customers to it. eBay is leveraging on its structured data and Artificial Intelligence (AI) strength to build product catalogs, enhance mobile platform, roll out new browse-inspired shopping journeys, enhance customer-to-customer (C2C) business and strengthen its brand.It accelerated its AI efforts through structured data, personalization, image search technology, and customer support initiatives in several areas.During the quarter, eBay announced that it will acquire Giosis' Japan business, including the Qoo10.jp platform. The deal which is expected to close in the second quarter of 2018, will likely expand eBay's footprint in Japan.Overall, we remain positive about eBay’s replatforming and brand enhancement initiatives. Its unique capabilities backed by technological improvements give it an edge over competitors such as Etsy (ETSY), Alibaba (BABA) and Facebook (FB).Revenues and GMVIn the first quarter, the Marketplace platform contributed $22.5 billion of gross merchandise volume (GMV) and $2.1 billion of revenues. Marketplace GMV grew 13% year over year on a reported basis and 7% on an FX-Neutral basis. The increase was aided by continued expansion of new user experiences.StubHub contributed $1 billion of GMV, up 14% on a year-over-year basis, and revenues of $232 million, up 9% year over year. The increase was driven by a robust sports landscape, including a record Super Bowl, and strong international growth.Classifieds platforms also performed well with contribution of $246 million of revenues, up 24% both on a year-over-year and 10% on a FX-Neutral basis, driven primarily by strength in Germany.Total GMV of $23.6 million in the first quarter grew 13% year over year on a reported.During the quarter, global active buyers/customers increased 4% from the year-ago quarter to 171 million.Margins and IncomePro forma gross margin for the quarter was 78.3%, up 60 basis points (bps) year over year.Adjusted operating expenses of $1.36 billion increased 16.1% from the prior-year quarter.

3152,EBAY,"eBay Inc. (EBAY  -  Free Report) announced plans to sell its stake in the Indian e-commerce giant, Flipkart to Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report) to relaunch eBay India. The move will bolster eBay’s presence in India.Last year, eBay invested $500 million in Flipkart to acquire 5.4% stake in Flipkart by vending its Indian division.eBay had licensed Flipkart to use its brand name. The company now intends to terminate the contract that was valued at $1.1 billion.The latest decision comes following Walmart’s announcement of acquiring a majority stake in Flipkart.eBay India aims to start cross-border trade in India via its online platform which will benefit both Indian sellers and buyers. Indian sellers will be able to sell their products to foreign customers, thus providing a global market to these merchants. Also, Indian customers will be able to purchase products of their choice from foreign merchants.We believe the latest move will boost eBay’s customer and merchant base, given the growing e-commerce market. This will benefit the top-line growth of the company.Coming to the price performance, shares of eBay have returned 13% over a year, underperforming the industry’s rally of 48.6%.India Holds PromisePer the latest report of India Brand Equity Foundation, Indian e-commerce market is expected to reach $200 billion by 2026 from $38.5 billion in 2017. Moreover, the market is anticipated to exceed $50 billion in 2018.The increasing use of smartphones and internet, courtesy of the ongoing digitalization in India, is likely to boost the internet user base in the country. Internet users are expected to reach 829 million by 2021, up from 373 million in 2016.Further, online shopping in the country is expected to reach $135.8 billion in 2018, surging 31% on a year-over-year basis.eBay entered the Indian market in 2004 with the acquisition of Bazee.com. In 2013, the company acquired a majority stake in Snapdeal which it sold early this year.We note that eBay is poised to reap benefits from the growing opportunities in the e-commerce space in India.eBay Inc. Revenue (TTM) eBay Inc. Revenue (TTM) | eBay Inc. Quote Improving CompetitionBy relaunching eBay India, the company will improve its competitive position against some major e-commerce players in India like – Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), Alibaba (BABA  -  Free Report) and Flipkart.Amazon’s e-commerce platform in India has been a big success and is expected to continue to bolster its business in the country. Additionally, Alibaba’s investment in Paytm Mall has strengthened its position in India.Hence, eBay India is likely to strengthen the market share of the company in the country. This will also drive its business growth.However, intensifying competition from Amazon and Flipkart along with their dominant position in the market remains a concern.Currently, eBay carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

3153,EBAY,"It seems like the technology companies have it in for Mr. Market. With a deaf ear to all the negative press, Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) followed Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) to report solid results, allaying fears that the growth in FANG may be nearing its end. Users simply have other things on their minds, and they are what continue to drive revenue to these tech titans.Amazon fairly smashed estimates, with revenue growing 42.9% to come in 1.7% ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate and earnings growing 120.9% to come in 168.0% ahead.So definitely, there’s something driving that earnings growth. Drilling down into the details, it appears that a favorable mix (North America and AWS increased as a percentage of sales while the loss-making international business declined slightly), decline in all except fulfillment cost as a percentage of sales, increase in other income and a lower tax rate as offset by higher fulfillment cost and interest expense (net) drove the results.A little over half (52.7%) of Amazon’s revenue came from its online stores, 8.4% from physical stores, 18.2% from third-party seller services, 6.1% from subscription services, 10.7% from AWS and 4.0% from other sources (mainly advertising). The strongest growth is in other, followed by subscription, AWS, third-party seller services and then online stores (sales growth in physical stores that came with Whole Foods can’t be compared since the acquisition was toward the end of 2017). So it does look like the company is firing on all cylinders.While still tiny compared to Alphabet’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) Google, Amazon’s advertising business can scale very quickly because of its direct connect with users, its ownership of the leading sales platform and a super personal assistant called Alexa that it’s trying to get into as many devices as possible. Like AWS, this is a much more profitable business than retail so will improve its earnings potential.The other business growing very fast is subscriptions (last quarter benefited from a change in the revenue recognition method), which will also see a boost from the recent price hike in Prime. Amazon said that Prime was getting more expensive because of the number of things it was adding to the service. So the annual subscription charges were bumped up by $20 to $119.Amazon/Bezos clearly has a lot of faith in the 100 million strong user base, and it will be good to know how those numbers grow going forward. Even if subscribers don’t grow at all, the price increase will bring in an additional $2 billion for the company right there helping it finance its growing content acquisition/original programming cost.The guidance is also strong: revenue growth of 34-42%, or $51.0-54.0 billion including favorable currency impact of $1.2 billion or 320 basis points and operating income increase of 75% to $1.1-1.9 billion. Summing UpOverall, it was a very good quarter for Amazon, with nothing to suggest any change in its leadership position across retail, cloud and Alexa.Amazon has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and it’s our strongest bet in the industry. But go ahead and indulge in any of these other Internet stocks because the sector is particularly hot right now: Boohoo (BHOOY  -  Free Report), IAC/Interactive (IAC  -  Free Report), PetMed Express (PETS  -  Free Report), Secoo (SECO  -  Free Report) or eBay (EBAY  -  Free Report).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks hereLooking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

3154,EBAY,"The separation of online marketplace eBay Inc. (EBAY  -  Free Report) and payment processing company PayPal Holdings Inc. (PYPL  -  Free Report) will step into its third year this July. So, we can easily find out how these two entities are performing and throw light on their recent financial results. Both companies reported on Apr 25 after market close.PayPal is now valued at $90.26 billion, almost 90% higher than its valuation on its first trading day. On the other hand, its erstwhile parent company eBay’s market cap has grown to $38.44 billion from $34.63 billion in July 2015 (read: ETFs to Ride on PayPal Growth Story).A Look at the Latest Earnings Picture: PYPL Wins, eBAy LoseseBay Earnings: MixedeBay Inc.’s first-quarter 2018 earnings matched the Zacks Consensus Estimate, while revenues missed the same by a slight margin. Pro-forma earnings of 53 cents improved 9% year over year.Gross revenues of $2.58 billion were up 12% on a year-over-year basis (up 7% on an Fx-neutral basis) but within the guided range of $2.57-$2.61 billion. Revenues were below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.598 billion. In Q1, eBay’s  active buyers grew 4% across its platforms.For the second quarter of 2018, eBay expects revenues to grow 6-8% on an Fx-neutral basis to $2.64-$2.68 billion compared with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.68 billion. Non-GAAP earnings are expected within 50-52 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate was 52 cents. Shares have lost 5.6% in the key trading session of Apr 26 thanks to this mixed result.PayPal Earnings: ImpressivePayPal reported first-quarter 2018 non-GAAP earnings of 57 cents per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 cents. The figure increased 29.5% on a year-over-year basis and 3.6% sequentially. The year-over-year growth was driven by strong operating results.Net revenues increased 24.2% year over year but decreased 0.5% sequentially to $3.69 billion, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.58 billion. The year-over-year growth was attributed to an improved customer base, which boosted total active accounts significantly in the first quarter.For second-quarter 2018, PayPal expects revenues between $3.78 billion and $3.83 billion, reflecting growth in the range of 21-22% at current spot rate and 19-20% on an FX-neutral basis. Non-GAAP earnings are anticipated within the range of 54-56 cents per diluted share.Shares of PayPal were up about 2.9% on Apr 26. The stock comes from a top-ranked Zacks industry (top 35%).Bottom LineBoth companies are transforming. eBay is cashing in on its structured data and Artificial Intelligence (AI) strength while PayPal is focusing on inorganic growth via several partnerships. As of now, PayPal saw fast success thanks to the rapid emergence of digital payment while eBay faces tough competition from the likes of Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report). While a single stock-pick is always an option, a basket approach gives greater protection.So, investors intending to ride on eBay’s gradual transformation on lesser risk may target First Trust Nasdaq Retail ETF (FTXD  -  Free Report), PowerShares Nasdaq Internet Portfolio (PNQI  -  Free Report) and First Trust Dow Jones Internet Index (FDN  -  Free Report) (read: ETFs Set to Surge on Robust Q1 Facebook Results).And many investors would definitely want to fly high with PayPal, especially after the Q1 earnings results.

3156,EBAY,"Headline worthy initial public offerings have been few and far between recently, and a few major tech companies have grabbed much of the IPO spotlight so far this year, including Spotify SPOT and Dropbox DBX. With that said, June could end up being the busiest month for IPOs in a long time, and this week is packed once again.Recent IPOsSpotify stock closed its first day of trading in early April at a price that valued the company at $26.5 billion, which helped it land as the eighth-largest tech IPO after one day of trading, directly behind Google and (GOOGL  -  Free Report) and Snap (SNAP  -  Free Report). Aside from Spotify and Dropbox, Docusign Inc DOCU and Smartsheet SMAR were a few other notable 2018 tech IPOs.Meanwhile, many investors have been looking forward to IPOs from Uber and Airbnb. But those industry-changing tech companies look poised to wait until at least 2019 to go public—although Uber rival Lyft could reportedly go public in late 2018.Since the start of June, 22 companies have gone public, with 12 more expected to IPO this week. In fact, if all the planned initial public offerings are completed this week, it would be the busiest IPO month since June 2015, according to Renaissance Capital. So let’s take a look at a few of the bigger IPOs expected this week and quickly break down what the companies do.BJ's Wholesale Club (BJ) - Deal Size: $600 million Exchange: NYSEBJ’s Wholesale is a membership-based grocery chain that operates over 200 stores across the East Coast, competing against the likes of Costco (COST  -  Free Report). The company was taken private by Leonard Green & Partners LP and CVC Capital Partners Ltd in 2011 for roughly $2.8 billion.BJ’s Wholesale reported annual sales of $12.75 billion last year and turned in a profit of $50.3 million. The company is set to go public amid changing times for the grocery industry. Yet, the talk of doom and gloom seems to have calmed down for the time being since Target (TGT  -  Free Report), Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report), and Kroger KR have all proven their ability to fight back against likes of Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) (also read: Should You Buy Grocery Stocks, WMT, COST, TGT, After Kroger's Strong Quarter?).The company’s IPO is expected to be priced between $15 per share and $17 per share, offering 37.5 million shares. Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAC  -  Free Report) is one of the lead underwriters.BrightView Holdings (BV) - Deal Size: $501 million Exchange: NYSEBrightView is a Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania-based commercial landscaping design and maintenance services company, which operates mostly in the U.S. BrightView works in an array of fields, including water management, golf, sports turf, snow and ice removal, and many more.Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) is the lead underwriter for the company that plans to list 21.3 million shares at between estimated $22 per share and $25 per share.Domo (DOMO) Deal Size: $189 million Exchange: NasdaqDomo (DOMO) is one of the most highly anticipated IPOs this week, mostly because of its one-time standing as a unicorn company—a private startup valued at over billion dollars. However, its valuation has plummeted 75% from its last funding round. Domo noted that the middle of its IPO pricing is expected to be $20.50 per share.Domo is a company that investors might want to pay close attention to over the first couple of months as its real-time business data analytics software competes against the likes IBM (IBM  -  Free Report), Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), and Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report). The Utah-based company’s clients include Mastercard MA and eBay (EBAY  -  Free Report). The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

3158,EBAY,"Flipkart, India’s leading ecommerce company, founded and headed by Sachin and Binny Bansal, is on the verge of selling a controlling stake to Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report) rather than Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), according to a recent Bloomberg report. The deal values the company at around $20 billion.Walmart’s entry is expected to come from a stake sale by Softbank and Tiger Global Management, but there could be other sellers. The company may also issue fresh shares that will in effect dilute ownership of all parties.Initial reports (rumors have been going on for at least a year) said that the company would acquire only a minor stake, but later reports said it could be as high as 50%.  It is broadly understood that a Walmart deal will close more smoothly than one with Amazon, because it would increase competition in the space and therefore be preferred by regulators. About FlipkartHaving been around for a while, the company already offers a good online platform, a nationwide network of warehouses, the requisite logistics and a range of payment options. This has been possible because of the steady flow of resources over time through Japan’s Softbank, China’s Tencent and America’s Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), eBay (EBAY  -  Free Report), Tiger Global, Accel Partners, Naspers and IDG Ventures.Flipkart recently consolidated its position by swallowing smaller rivals Myntra and Jabong. The company also has plans to buy an 8-10% stake in Future Lifestyle Fashions Ltd, one of the largest branded apparel retailers in the country, which could be one of the reasons it is trying to raise cash. Last year, Amazon bought a 5% stake in Shoppers Stop, another leading retail brand.So as things stand today, Flipkart is Amazon’s main rival in India, with the two together accounting for 80% of online B2C ecommerce in the country. Snapdeal is third.Government Allows 100% FDI (with Caveats)The Indian ecommerce market has gained momentum over the last 5-6 years, mainly on account of the constantly increasing Internet penetration, increasing use of smartphones, a growing middle class and a young population.Interest in the space has spiked after the government, in March 2016, clarified regulatory frameworks within which foreign companies could operate. The new rules allow 100% foreign direct investment (FDI) in ecommerce companies, as long as they operate as marketplaces and hold no inventory of their own.The department of industrial policy and promotion (DIPP) of India has defined a marketplace model as an information technology platform run by an e-commerce entity on a digital and electronic network to act as a facilitator between buyer and seller. So 100% foreign ownership is permitted as long as these companies stick tothe provision ofwarehousing, logistics, order fulfilment, call center/customer care and payment collection while staying away from the creation or sale of retail inventory of their own or the provision of after-sales services. The government’s goal in this was to promote the interests of small sellers by giving them a platform to reach more people and stimulating job creation in the process.The revised rules also said that these online platforms wouldn’t be able to influence prices, seeking to put a stop to the huge discounts that smaller or brick-and-mortar operations wouldn’t be able to match. But workarounds appear possible. Amazon for example reportedly has what it calls “promotional funding” that allows it to advise retailers to heavily discount their items. If they agree, Amazon pays them the difference.Another protection for small sellers comes in the form of a ceiling on the amount that a single seller can contribute to the platform (currently capped at 25% of the total turnover of the ecommerce company).There are also provisions that require the name and contact details of the seller to be displayed on the website. RecommendationWalmart has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) while Amazon shares carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

3159,EBAY,"Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) longest Prime Day is expected to hit hard prominent retailers’ efforts to cash-in on the back-to-school season in 2018.Started in 2015, Amazon’s Prime Day offers special deals, including deep discounts on in-house products. Notably, the event is only open to members of the Prime subscription service, which has crossed more than 100 million of paid members globally (as of April 2018).Amazon’s Prime Day has been a success as it helps the company generate strong sales in a traditionally slower part of the year. Per Cowen & Co. and JP Morgan Chase analysis, quoted by CNBC, Amazon generated $1 billion in sales on 2017 Prime Day.Moreover, since 2017 Prime Day (Jul 10), Amazon’s shares have returned 70.6%, better than the industry’s rally of 39.1% and a host of competitors. Amazon's Price Performance (Since Jul 10, 2017) We expect 2018 to be a no-exception, primarily due to growing number of deals (more than one million per Amazon). Moreover, Prime’s expanding international subscriber base is a key catalyst. Per MarketWatch, Prime members in Australia, Singapore, the Netherlands and Luxembourg will also participate in the event this year.Amazon Disrupts Back-to-School Season MarketAugust-September has been traditionally considered as the back-to-school season in the United States. The importance of this season lies in the fact that in terms of consumer spending it is second to winter holidays. According to Deloitte, 50% of school related annual spending happens during back-to-school season.Hence, retailers are eager to leverage the increased traffic to enrol customers into their loyalty programs that ensures revenue visibility throughout the year.However, Amazon’s Prime Day, which is held a month earlier, has disrupted this trend.MarketWatch cited data from Cardlytics 2018 Back-to-School Spend Report, which states that Prime Day has brought in a change in consumer behavior. Consumers now prefer to stock-up back-to-school season supplies a month-ahead to benefit from the deep discounts offered by Prime Day.Further, per the Cardlytics report, “back-to-school spending continues to grow, but shoppers are making fewer purchases, while spending more each time.”The change in consumer behavior is also supported by RetailMeNot data. According to its latest survey, 91% parents surveyed are planning to do their back-to-school shopping on Prime Day and almost 40% of their planned spending is likely to be on back-to-school items.Although this trend doesn’t bode well for brick-and-mortar retailers, it is significant for Amazon. The company is leaving no stone unturned to lure back-to-school customers. It recently announced new Back to School and Off to College online stores. The lower-priced stores are expected to further drive traffic and sales.Moreover, Amazon has introduced an option to allow teens aged 13 to 17 shop independently on the Amazon app, under parental monitoring. Per MarketWatch, college students can also rent or purchase textbooks.How Retailers are Preparing to Counter Amazon?Retailers with compelling offers and deep discounts are expected to woo most of the back-to-school spenders, only if they offer it in early summer.Per Deloitte’s survey, 60% shoppers hitting stores before August are anticipated to spend an average of $532, 16% higher than the remaining 40% of parents who start shopping in August or later ($458).Hence, the July event has forced many retailers to match Amazon’s footsteps in offering back-to-school products. Prominent retailers like J.C. Penny (JCP  -  Free Report), Kohl’s Corp (KSS  -  Free Report) and Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report) have taken a number of initiatives to attract the back-to-school traffic.Notably, J.C. Penny has partnered with Fanatics to launch Fanatics shops that sell licensed sports merchandise.Retail giant Walmart is bolstering its online shopping features by offering 3-D Virtual Shopping Tour, especially for dorm rooms and small living spaces. The company is also offering curated collections that can be purchased together, called “Buy the Room.”Kohl’s has begun seasonal hiring much earlier at more than 300 of its 1,100 stores to support the peak shopping seasons.Moreover, eBay (EBAY  -  Free Report) announced an expansion to its price-matching program to more than 100,000 items across its marketplace, up from 50,000 items.ConclusionAmazon’s aggressive retail strategy, expanding seller base and distribution strength will continue to benefit it in gaining traction in the retail space.Retailers are also preparing themselves to counter Amazon’s growing threat in every possible way.However, Amazon and the retailer tussle is ultimately proving beneficial to consumers, who are encashing the deep discounts and deals.While Amazon, J.C. Penny, Kohl’s and Walmart currently have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), eBay carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

3160,EBAY,"Shares of Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) closed slightly lower on Friday after Japanese anti-trust officials raided the company’s Tokyo offices for the second time in two years. The concern that Amazon is assembling a global monopoly is one of many critiques faced by the e-commerce behemoth these days.From Wall Street’s perspective, the main criticism of Amazon is that its stock’s valuation is stretched beyond that of a “normal” company. Amazon has been among the hottest stocks in the world over the past few years, but the company has not prioritized calls for near-term profitability, leaving some bearish traders to question whether its momentum is justified.To visualize exactly what we are talking about here, take a look at how Amazon’s Forward P/E has trended over the last year compared to its peer group: Amazon’s peer group includes other global internet and e-commerce powerhouses like JD.com (JD  -  Free Report), Alibaba (BABA  -  Free Report), and Ebay (EBAY  -  Free Report). These companies are not perfectly comparable to Amazon, but they help show how investors tend to value modern digital giants.Investors are clearly willing to pay a significant premium for these types of companies versus the broader market, but Amazon’s valuation is a different situation entirely.With a Forward P/E of nearly 160, investors are so confident in Amazon’s ability to outperform the market that they are ready to dish out 160x the company’s expected profits over the next year for the stock right now. And this has been trending upward over the past 52 weeks, implying that AMZN has found interested buyers regardless of its ever-stretching valuation.Nonetheless, these buyers have been proven right so far. As we can see from this price performance chart, Amazon has significantly outpaced the returns of its peer group over the past year: So one reason for Amazon’s sky-high valuation is that its stock has been an absolute machine recently, surging higher at a pace that would have any investor excited. But what is the underlying reason for this momentum?Well, one factor is Amazon’s ability to attract positive responses to great earnings reports while effectively shrugging off weak reports. For example, the company missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share by an entire dollar in late July, but in the two days following the report, its stock was only down about 3% from where it was two days prior to the report.In the next-reported quarter, Amazon crushed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings and moved 13% higher over the same type of timeframe.Still, there has to be more to the story here. Why is it that Amazon is frequently met with more investor optimism than pessimism? How can traders continue to send the stock higher despite its lofty valuation?There is no one correct answer here, but we can explain this phenomenon most effectively by considering what Amazon hopes to accomplish down the line. As mentioned, Amazon seems willing to forget about near-term earnings consistency at the moment. For instance, while its gross margin has improved significantly over the past few years, its actual net margin has remained stagnant for some time.Investors have identified Amazon as a unique-enough company to overlook traditional valuation strategies and focus on the company’s overarching vision.Amazon has long-since been the king of e-commerce in the U.S., but it still has plenty of room to grow in huge markets like China and India. Meanwhile, its aspirations clearly extend well beyond online shopping, and its brick-and-mortar dreams are evident in its buyout of Whole Foods and launch of Amazon Go and Amazon Books stores.What’s more, the growth of Amazon Web Services and management’s continued investments in budding tech trends like artificial intelligence promise to situate the company at the front of the pack in the next technological generation.To many investors, this is a speculative and risky viewpoint. But to those who believe in what Amazon is doing now—and what it might be doing in 20 years—the stock’s current earnings multiple is nothing to be concerned about.Want more market analysis from this author?

3162,EBAY,"Stocks opened slightly lower on Wednesday even as big-name companies continue to perform well during quarterly earnings season. This means that investors need to be even more selective and only consider buying stocks that are expected to outperform expectations.Economic bellwethers Caterpillar (CAT  -  Free Report) and 3M (MMM  -  Free Report) provided downbeat guidance after reporting strong quarterly results recently, which helped quash some investor confidence. These moves also underscore larger market uncertainty and put even pressure on companies to post Q1 earnings beats in order to boost investor confidence in the near-term. With that said, let’s take a look at three well-known companies that look poised to impress investors on Wednesday, by posting better-than-expected earnings results. To do this, Zacks Premium customers can utilize the Earnings ESP Screener in order to search for stocks that are expected to surprise.This is done because, generally speaking, when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat. In fact, our 10-year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70% of the time.Today, we are giving our readers a free look at three of these strong stocks in order to help them avoid any further losses as market volatility continues.Check them out now: 1.      AT&T (T  -  Free Report)AT&T stock is down 12% over the last year and 6% in the last 12 weeks. Shares also dipped in early morning trading on Wednesday, which might signal that investors are nervous about AT&T ahead of its first quarter earnings report. But the company’s bottom line estimates should please investors. AT&T is expected to see its earnings surge 17.6% from the year-ago period to reach $0.87 per share, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates.AT&T is also currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and sports an Earnings ESP of 1.53%. The company’s Most Accurate Estimate—the representation of the most recent analyst sentiment—calls for earnings of $0.89 per share, which comes in 2 cents above our current consensus estimate. Therefore, AT&T is a stock that investors can reasonably expect to top Q1 earnings estimates.  2.       eBay (EBAY  -  Free Report)EBay’s quarterly revenues are projected to hit $2.6 billion, which would mark a 17.2% climb. Meanwhile, the company’s earnings are expected to expand by 8.2% to reach $0.53 per share. Better still, eBay’s Most Accurate Estimate calls for earnings of $0.54 per share, which comes in 1 cent above our current consensus estimate.The company is also currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and rocks an Earnings ESP of 0.91%. Therefore, investors can consider eBay a stock that looks poised to top Q1 earnings estimates when it reports its financial results after market close.3.       Visa (V  -  Free Report)Shares of Visa slipped slightly today, but are still up 31% over the last year and 3% in the last month. And it looks like Visa might be able to continue its current run as its quarterly revenues are projected to reach $4.78 billion. Meanwhile, the credit card firm’s quarterly earnings are expected to expand by 17.4% to hit $1.01 per share. Investors should also note that the company’s Most Accurate Estimate comes in 1 cent above our current consensus estimate at $1.02 per share. This gives Visa an Earnings ESP of 0.73%, which coupled with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) ranking, means that investors should consider Visa a stock that could beat quarterly earnings estimates. Investor Alert: Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization. Billions of dollars in research have poured into it.

3163,EBAY,"Semtech Corporation (SMTC  -  Free Report) is set to report fiscal fourth-quarter 2018 results on Mar 14.  Last quarter, it posted a positive earnings surprise of 10.2%.The company’s surprise history has been pretty impressive. It beat estimates in each of the last four quarters with an average of 6.9%.Coming to share price movement, Semtech’s stock has returned only 0.87% in the last year, underperforming the industry’s gain of 24.9%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlaySemtech reported mixed fiscal third-quarter 2018 results with earnings beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues missing the same.The company’s improved profitability was driven by differentiated growth drivers and diversification strategy. Key growth drivers for Semtech are product differentiation, operational flexibility, and a specific focus on fast-growing segments and regions.In the fiscal third quarter, the company saw strong demand for high-end consumer and industrial end markets. The growing need for more efficient energy management in home and industrial settings, increasing electronic system requirements for mobile devices, and propagation of green standards will continue to drive demand in these segments.However, weakness in the enterprise computing and communications markets could impact results. Also, concerns about the company’s exposure to seasonality, a competitive market and foreign exchange risk persist.For fiscal fourth-quarter 2018, on a non-GAAP basis, management expects revenues in the range of $138-$142 million. This implies 7.1% sequential decline at the mid-point of the guided range.Non-GAAP gross profit margin is expected within 61.0% and 62.0%. Management projects SG&A expenses within $26-$27million, and research and development expenses in the range of $23-$24 million. Non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to come in at 40-42 cents.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Semtech will beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for the company is -0.41%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank:Semtech carries a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with a 0.00% ESP makes a surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Semtech Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Semtech Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Semtech Corporation Quote Stocks to ConsiderWe see a likely earnings beat for each of the following companies:EVINE Live Inc.

3164,EBAY,"The U.S. Supreme Court dealt a blow to online retail stocks on Jun 21, 2018 by its decision on State Sales tax. The 5-4 ruling permits states to collect sales taxes from online and out-of-state retailers. The latest decision rules out a 1992 Supreme Court ruling that barred such practice.But then, online retailing was a small section in 1992. Justice Anthony Kennedy noted that the reason for the upturn in the previous ruling was the radical change in the online retail industry. The 1992 ruling was mainly concerned about the mail-order business worth $180 billion.But now the online retail industry has bourgeoned. ""Last year, e-commerce retail sales alone were estimated at $453.5 billion,” Justice Anthony Kennedy mentioned. This along with traditional remote sellers amounted to more than half a trillion dollars.Needless to say, such a ruling weighed on online retail ETFs on Jun 21. Amplify Online Retail ETF (IBUY  -  Free Report) was down 1.4% and ProShares Long Online/Short Stores ETF (CLIX  -  Free Report) lost 2.3%. On the other hand, brick-and mortar retailers staged a jump (read: Here's Why the Rally in Retail ETFs Will Continue in 2H).Among online retail stocks, Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) lost about 1.1% on Jun 21 while eBay Inc. (EBAY  -  Free Report) shed more (down 3.25%) than Amazon. Retailers like Overstock.com Inc. (OSTK  -  Free Report) (down 7.25%) and Shopify Inc. (SHOP  -  Free Report) (down 4.55%) were also hit hard.What Left Amazon Less-Battered?Experts do not see Amazon as suffering from the Supreme Court ruling. This is because “Amazon already collects sales tax on the products it sells directly.” Since this makes up about half of all units sold on its site, the court ruling should not have much impact on Amazon.However, the rest of the products are sold by third-party merchants on Amazon's marketplace and “the ruling doesn't make clear how third-party sales should be taxed,” per a law professor at the University of Arizona, as quoted on CNBC. Moody's analyst Charlie O'Shea also believes that if whether higher taxes on those smaller retailers’ goods will affect Amazon's overall revenue is still unclear. Moreover, companies like Amazon have wide international exposure, which should guard them from U.S. State taxes.Strong Technicals of AmazonThe stock has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). It comes from a top-ranked Zacks industry (top 33%) and a top-ranked Zacks Sector (to 31%).Amazon’s short-term moving average is well above the long-term and mid-term averages as depicted by the 200-Day SMA and 50-Day SMA in the chart below. This suggests continued bullishness for this stock.However, the Relative Strength Index for AMZN was at 69.72, reflecting an overbought position. Since this sent the stock in an overvalued territory, recent selling pressure (due to Supreme Court ruling) in the stock may bode well for it over the long term.In this regard, we would like to note that investors uncomfortable with Amazon’s overvaluation can play the company via ETFs.ETFs in Focus So, investors can have faith on Amazon-heavy ETFs like Consumer Discret Sel Sect SPDR ETF (XLY  -  Free Report), VanEck Vectors Retail ETF (RTH  -  Free Report), iShares Edge MSCI Multifactor Consumer Discretionary ETF (CNDF  -  Free Report), Fidelity MSCI Consumer Discretionary Index ETF (FDIS  -  Free Report) and Vanguard Consumer Discretionary ETF (VCR  -  Free Report).

3165,EBAY,"Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) shares gained more than 1% on Monday morning after new reports suggested that management is working on a checking account product. The company’s interest in adding financial services could add another sector to the list of those disrupted by Amazon, underscoring the e-commerce behemoth’s remarkable influence.It did not take long for the online bookseller to evolve into a dominant retail force, and over the past several years, we have seen Amazon parlay its digital dominance into brick-and-mortar offerings and widespread innovation. AMZN is not only an e-commerce stock, but also a legitimate play in budding markets like video streaming, artificial intelligence, consumer staples, and cloud computing.Amazon is now a company that has significant influence over the everyday behavior of its core customer base. Investors have certainly noticed this expansion, and shares have skyrocketed more than 80% over the past year alone.But at least some of Amazon’s latest surge is owed to speculation over the company’s future. Sure, the Seattle-based firm is investing in innovation right now, but that is coming at the expense of some profits.Amazon is currently sporting a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). However, investors should really focus on the stock’s Style Score grades. Right now, AMZN is holding an “A” grade in the Growth category—but an “F” grade for Value.Traditional value investors are likely to conclude that Amazon is too pricey right now. The stock is trading with a staggering Forward P/E of 176.7, and its PEG of 6.6 implies that its bottom-line growth is coming at a significant cost too.One might mention that Amazon is best not to be compared to the broader market, but even when compared to its peer group, the stock looks at least a bit overvalued. Here’s a peek at AMZN’s recent P/S trend versus that of its peers:Our system puts seven other stocks in Amazon’s peer group, including global internet commerce powerhouses like JD.com (JD  -  Free Report), Alibaba (BABA  -  Free Report), and Ebay (EBAY  -  Free Report). The P/S ratio is a useful tool for valuing these companies, especially considering the high cost of international growth and the razor-thin margins we often see in e-commerce.Many investors would look at these key metrics and conclude that AMZN is overpriced at its current levels. However, a compelling case could be made that investors simply have to pay a premium for companies that present such a rare combination of industry dominance and future potential.The key to Amazon’s success over the next few years will be its ability to cash in on the user infrastructure it has built. The company has worked hard to create Amazon-for-life customers that use its services every day, across many segments of their lives.For example, its acquisition of Whole Foods gave the company a grocery business that helps provide the fresher foods some might not look to buy online. Meanwhile, Amazon’s Echo speakers and Alexa assistant push customers back to its online platforms and secure closer interaction between its users and services. Amazon also has a powerful media division that is pumping out popular, critically-acclaimed content.As we head into a new generation of technology that will see further autonomy and artificial intelligence, the familiarity and understanding that Amazon is building right now may prove to be incredibly valuable.These investments have stretched Amazon’s current valuation, but they also present an investing opportunity like no other.

3166,EBAY,"eBay Inc. (EBAY  -  Free Report) is a well-established player in the e-commerce space and also has a first-mover advantage. To maintain its dominance, eBay has introduced several measures to fuel growth in its Marketplaces business.eBay has been giving more data to its marketplace sellers. These data include price guidance, restocking guidance and more insight into inventory such as demand signals for the right products, price and timing. Additionally, eBay continues to increase user engagement and satisfaction by driving traffic to its top-rated sellers. As a result, same-store sales at these retailers continue to grow at a healthy rate. The company expanded the use of social channels, which is significantly increasing traffic growth.Also, Raymond James’ analyst Aaron Kessler remains encouraged by the company’s growth in its marketplace business. He believes that platform changes, product innovation and promoted listings will help in driving the Marketplace business in 2018. Consequently, the analyst has upgraded its rating based on the company’s growth in its marketplace business.Following the upgrade, eBay’s shares were up 1.61% to $42.95. In a year’s time, the stock has gained 29.2% underperforming its industry’s growth of 65.7%.He believes that gross merchandise volume (GMV) growth will continue to accelerate this year driven by enhancements to the buyer experience. In the recently reported fourth quarter, Marketplace GMV grew 9% year over year on a reported basis and 6% on an FX-Neutral basis.Total GMV of $24.4 million grew 10% from the prior-year quarter on a reported and 7% on a Fx-neutral basis.The analyst believes that the company's Promoted Listings product will be accretive to earnings in 2018. In the last reported quarter, nearly 160,000 sellers used promoted listings to advertise more than 100 million items. That accounted for 50% of sequential revenue growth in the fourth quarter.Bottom LineeBay is one of the world's largest online trading communities with a powerful marketplace for sale of goods and services by individuals and small businesses. The company enables trade on a local, national and international basis with local sites in numerous markets in the United States and country-specific sites in the United Kingdom, Canada, Germany, Austria, France, Italy, Japan, Korea and Australia.The company is making all efforts to improve its Marketplace business.

3167,EBAY,"The online retail stocks were hit hard on Jun 21, 2018 on the ruling of the supreme court of the United States (SCOTUS) on sales tax. The 5-4 ruling permits states to collect sales taxes from online and out-of-state retailers. The latest decision reverses a 1992 Supreme Court ruling that prohibited the practice.Justice Anthony Kennedy noted that the reason for the upturn in the previous ruling was the radical change in online retail industry. The 1992 ruling was mainly concerned about the mail-order business worth $180 billion.But now the online retail industry has ballooned.  ""Last year, e-commerce retail sales alone were estimated at $453.5 billion,” he mentioned. This along with traditional remote sellers amounted to more than half a trillion dollars.Below we highlight a few ETF and stock winners and losers following the Supreme tax ruling.Brick-and Mortar Retailers: A Clear Winner Brick-and Mortar retailers became the most-expected winners. Companies like Walmart Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) (up 0.7%) and Kohl's Corporation (KSS  -  Free Report) (up 1.14%) thus gained on Jun 21. The broader retail ETF VanEck Vectors Retail ETF (RTH  -  Free Report) added about 0.24% on that day.Online Retailers: An Obvious Loser  Online retail ETFs like Amplify Online Retail ETF (IBUY  -  Free Report) (down 1.4%) and ProShares Long Online/Short Stores ETF (CLIX  -  Free Report) (down 2.3%) slid on Jun 21, to reflect the Supreme Court ruling.Amazon: A Surprising Long-Term WinnerThough online retail behemoth Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) lost more than 1.1% on Jun 21, experts do not foresee the company to suffer from the ruling. This is because “Amazon already collects sales tax on the products it sells directly.” Since this makes up about half of all units sold on its site, the court ruling should not have much impact on Amazon.However, the rest of the products are sold by third-party merchants on Amazon's marketplace and “the ruling doesn't make clear how third-party sales should be taxed,” per a law professor at the University of Arizona, as quoted on CNBC. Even Moody's analyst Charlie O'Shea believes that whether higher taxes on those smaller retailers’ goods will at all affect Amazon's overall revenues is still unclear.Moreover, companies such as Amazon and eBay Inc. (EBAY  -  Free Report) (down 3.25% on Jun 21) have wide international exposure, which should cushion them from U.S. State taxes. So, investors can have faith on Amazon-heavy ETFs like Consumer Discret Sel Sect SPDR ETF (XLY  -  Free Report) (read: May's Retail Sales Growth Highest in 6 Months: ETFs & Stocks).Small Online Retailers Likely to be Hard-HitSmaller online retailers with concentrated exposure to the U.S. market are likely to be knocked-down the most. Notably, online retailer Overstock.com Inc. (OSTK  -  Free Report) shed a solid 7.2% on Jun 21. The company generates sales mainly from the United States.Consumers May Feel the Pinch Overall, if taxes are hiked, companies may choose to pass that burden on to consumers. So, consumers’ shopping bills could see a jump ahead. iShares US Consumer Services ETF (IYC  -  Free Report) should thus be on investors’ radar.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week. Get it free >>

3170,EBAY,"As the Supreme Court discusses the pros and cons of overriding the precedent set in the case of Quill vs. North Dakota, small sellers and platforms like Etsy (ETSY  -  Free Report) and eBay (EBAY  -  Free Report) that support them have started doing all they can to rouse public opinion against it.In that case, the High Court upheld the decision of a lower court that only retailers with a physical presence in a state need to collect the state sales tax.Now, South Dakota is looking to challenge the decision/precedent/effective law with a 2016 law of its own. Accordingly, out-of-state sellers doing more than $100,000 of business in the state or more than 200 transactions annually have to collect state sales tax and deposit it with the concerned state authority. And online sellers Overstock.com, Wayfair and Newegg are caught in the crossfire.The current law makes it easy for micro operations to leverage online marketplaces to sell their wares to a wider clientele. Since they obviously don’t have a physical presence in all the states to which they are delivering, they don’t collect or pay any sales tax. The lack of complications and relatively lower price (that don’t include the sales tax) therefore allowed them to prosper.Three Perceived ProblemsFirst, it hits revenue in the states where the goods are sold since the sales aren’t taxed.Second, the relative affordability of online products compared to brick and mortar operations in the state that have to include the sales tax in the price leads to even lower revenue for the states. So this is something of a double-whammy for states.Third, for brick and mortar operations, this is unfair competition.So it isn’t surprising that around 40 states are looking to override the precedent, with some support from lawmakers. President Trump is with the states, but that’s not the issue here.    Judges Scratching Their HeadsSome justices are going with the Trump administration (and the states), expressing concern over the financial condition of states and how they need every bit of revenue that’s owed to them.Others are wary of the obvious problem that a change would badly hit small sellers, who have limited resources to tackle the separate tax laws across an estimated 12,000 state and local jurisdictions. A counter-argument is that if forced, suitable software would come into being that would take care of things. But whatever the case, it would drive up costs for small sellers that could include middlemen to handle the tax issue.Another thought is that small sellers, if pushed by the law, could be driven straight to big online platforms like Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) that could handle the complexity for a small fee. In the words of Justice Elena Kagan, “There’s something a little bit ironic in saying the problem with Quill is that it benefited all these companies, so now we’re going to overturn Quill so that we can benefit the exact same companies.”The fourth argument (in support of just letting things be) is that states, upon finding no recourse in courts, have already started adopting workarounds. Online merchants in Colorado for example, are required to report their transactions so the state can collect from buyers directly, according to Justice Neil Gorsuch.Fifth, Chief Justice John Roberts also supports status quo because since the big online retailers are already covered, it is a diminishing problem.No Solution at This PointEveryone realizes that the states are losing revenue, but the real question is how much. And some justices have raised the issue of limited information on how much money is at stake.The states basically need to do a lot more homework. It’s one thing to say that a state is losing revenue to another state, but the opposite is also true: that that other state is also losing revenue at its expense. Because small sellers are there in every state. So when claiming monetary loss, the gains have to be deducted. And at the end of the day, some will obviously be making gains versus others making losses. So the problem may boil down to a difference in tax rates or value of goods instead.Second, tax layers and rates vary across states, so there could be inequalities among states in this respect as well.Third, the value of goods supplied can vary between states with more processed items in general having more value added. So states selling less processed goods can earn relatively less unless they charge a higher rate.  The problem arises because the current system recognizes the sale in the state in which it occurs. If all sales by a seller were simply taxed in the state of his/her residence, the problem would be solved.Overhauling the tax law or making any changes in it is a function of the legislature and not the judiciary, which is entrusted with its interpretation only.  So it’s difficult for the court to solve the problem.RecommendationsAmazon has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) while other players in the space like eBay, Etsy, PetMed Express (PETS  -  Free Report) have a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). So take your pick. Or consider the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

3171,EBAY,"Shares of eBay (EBAY  -  Free Report) have climbed 23% over the last year, and Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) analysts just recently “double upgraded” the stock. With that said, investors must still consider how eBay is expected to perform in the first quarter, as Q1 will likely have a greater impact on eBay’s near-term price movement than Morgan Stanley’s positive long-term outlook.Morgan Stanley analysts raised their eBay rating to “overweight” all the up way from “underweight.” The investment bank also up its price target from $36 per share to $58 a share, which marks a nearly 40% premium compared to eBay’s closing price on Wednesday.The reason for this substantial upgrade centers on the fact that eBay, which split from PayPal (PYPL  -  Free Report) a few years ago, will finally start to transition away from the online payment platform—with a full transition expected by mid-2020. “EBay acting as both marketplace and payment intermediator could simplify and reduce costs for merchants, who would pay a single fee to eBay,” analyst Brian Nowak wrote in a note to clients.However, eBay’s recent upgrade and year-long momentum don’t mean investors should consider buying the stock ahead of its Q1 earnings report.Therefore, we have to look at what to expect from eBay’s first quarter earnings results to let investors decide if they want to buy eBay stock in order to take home some possible near-term gains.Latest Outlook & ValuationEBay’s Q1 revenues are projected to surge by 17.2% to reach $2.6 billion, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates. Meanwhile, the company’s EPS figure is expected to expand by 8.2% to reach $0.53 per share.It is also worth noting that eBay has experienced nothing but positive Q1 earnings estimate revision activity recently.Of course, revenue and earnings growth estimates are just two of the many metrics investors will consider when eBay reports its first quarter financial results.Heading into Thursday, eBay was trading with a Forward P/E of 21.9, which marks a substantial discount compared to the “Internet - Commerce” industry’s average of 49.7. Investors should be excited to see that eBay offers such great value, especially compared to its industry, for a company that is expected to experience big Q1 revenue growth.  EBay has also consistently traded at this earnings multiple over the last year, while its stock price has climbed. This signals that eBay’s earnings estimates have also continually climbed higher over this period.Earnings ESP WhispersInvestors will also want to understand what chance eBay has to surprise with better-than-anticipated earnings results. For this, we turn to our Earnings ESP figure.Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst estimates. This is done because, generally speaking, when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat. In fact, our 10-year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70% of the time.Ebay is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and sports an Earnings ESP of 0.31%. The company’s Most Accurate Estimate—the representation of the most recent analyst sentiment—calls for earnings of $0.54 per share, which comes in 1 cent above our current consensus estimate.Therefore, investors can consider eBay a stock that looks poised to top Q1 earnings estimates when it reports its Q1 financial results after market close on Wednesday, April 25.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

The company ended 2017 with approximately 609,000 merchants on its platform.As of Dec 31, 2017, MRR was $29.9 million, up 62% from $18.5 million as of Dec 31, 2016. Shopify Plus accounted for $6.3 million or 21% of MRR compared with 17% of MRR in the year-ago quarter.Merchant Solutions revenues grew 74% to $128.9 million, backed primarily by the growth of Gross Merchandise Volume (“GMV”), which soared 65% from the year-ago quarter to $9.1 billion.

3173,EBAY,"Shopify Inc.(SHOP  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 15. Notably, the company’s earnings have outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three out of the four trailing quarters, with an average positive surprise of 166.5%.In the last quarter, Shopify reported non-GAAP earnings of 5 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 2 cents per share. The figure also improved from a loss of 2 cents per share reported in the year-ago quarter.Moreover, revenues jumped 72% from the year-ago quarter to $171.5 million, comfortably surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $166 million.Shopify continues to launch a number of merchant-friendly applications to meet the requirements of a dynamic retail environment, thereby adding to its merchant base which gets reflected in the year-over-year top-line growth.We expect the company’s merchant focus strategy and strong partner referral system to expand its customer base, ultimately driving the top line. Moreover, the availability of Apple Pay (AAPL  -  Free Report) and addition of eBay (EBAY  -  Free Report), Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), Facebook Messenger and Instagram as sales channels will have a significant impact on the top line in the soon-to-be reported quarter.Shopify Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Shopify Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Shopify Inc. QuoteGuidance & EstimatesFor fourth-quarter 2017, Shopify projects revenues in the range of $206-$208 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $207.99 million.Notably, shares of Shopify have gained 128.3% in the past year, substantially outperforming the 23.2% rally of the industry it belongs to.Factors to Influence Q4 ResultsIn the soon-to-be reported quarter, the company is expected to see a significant increase in revenues driven by record sales. Shopify recently announced that its worldwide merchant base of over 500,000 sold more than $1 billion worth of gross merchandise volume (GMV) during the Black Friday and Cyber Monday (BFCM) weekend. Merchants also generated above $1 million transactions in a minute during the peak hour. This reflects the company’s solid global presence.The shipping partnerships with the likes of UPS and DHL Express are added positives. The application called Live View helped in real-time reporting of the performance of the stores. Also, the discounting procedure was simplified.In addition, the company’s new application called Buy Online for Shopify POS that enabled shoppers to try products in person and then buy those at a later convenient date is encouraging.The company added quite a few prominent brands like Phoenix Suns, RBS, Josie Maran and Rebecca Minkoff. Consumer packaged goods providers like Gurmay, Mai, Blue Diamond Growers and Beer Nuts also enriched the merchant base.We believe the company’s easy-to-use upgrades and expanding merchant base to boost GMV, which soared 69% from the year-ago quarter to $6.4 billion in the preceding quarter. This trend is anticipated to continue, thereby aiding the company to perform impressively, going ahead.However, Shopify is a relatively new player in the e-commerce marketplace. Although it is not a direct competitor to behemoths like Alibaba and Amazon, many of its customers are. Moreover, the company focuses on the SMB segment, which is more susceptible to macro-economic headwinds. Both factors present significant risk for growth prospects.Further, management expects results to be impacted by seasonality and a significant impact of foreign exchange on operating expenses.Shopify carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

3174,EBAY,"Benchmarks finished mostly in the red on Thursday as investors switched from equities to bonds after Treasury bond yields continued to hover near their best levels since April 2014. Additionally, weak earnings results from United Parcel Service weighed on the broader S&P 500. Further, the tech-heavy index, Nasdaq fell ahead of major tech earnings. However, rising rate hike prospects pushed financial blue-chips like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan upward, which in turn boosted the Dow.How the Benchmarks Fared?The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) increased 0.1%, to close at 26,186.71. However, the S&P 500 fell 0.1% to close at 2,821.98. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 7,385.86, losing 0.4%. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) increased 1.6% to close at 13.75. A total of around 7.80 billion shares were traded on Thursday, higher than the last 20-session average of 7.23 billion shares. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 1.24 -to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 1.01-to-1 ratio favored advancing issues.What Moved the Benchmarks?In its two-day policy statement following the meeting ended Jan 31, the Fed indicated that the labor market remained strong, while inflation will likely “move up” in 2018 and will reach the desired 2% rate in the “medium term.” The central bank also said federal funds rate is likely to increase at a “gradual” pace in coming months.Tighter labor market and prospects of rise in inflation raised rate hike prospects as early as Fed’s next policy meeting in March, which in turn weighed on investor sentiment. Higher rate environment and optimism of steady economic growth and higher inflation weighed on bond prices.Lower bond prices supported the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield, which increased from 2.722% on Wednesday to 2.773% on Thursday, its best levels since April 2014. Also, 30-year U.S. Treasury yield surged more than 3% for the first time since May 2017. High treasury yields weighed on broader equity markets to a great extent.Q4 Earnings Continue to Hog AttentionOn the earnings front, shares of United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS  -  Free Report) decreased 6.1% despite posting upbeat fourth-quarter earnings results. (Read More) High level of shipping costs during the holiday season weighed on the package delivery company’s net profit, which in turn dragged down share performance.Additionally, PayPal Holdings, Inc’s (PYPL  -  Free Report) shares declined 8.1% after its former parent company, eBay Inc. (EBAY  -  Free Report) decided to rely less on the company for processing payments. Separately, the company posted fourth-quarter earnings per share and revenues, which beat their respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. (Read More)Meanwhile, tech stocks took a breather on Thursday ahead of earnings from major tech companies like, Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report), Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) and Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL  -  Free Report).Economic Data Bolsters Rate Hike ChancesPer the Bureau of Labor Statistics preliminary data, non-farm business sector labor productivity declined 0.1% in the fourth quarter of 2017. The decrease was in contrast to previous quarter’s increase of 2.7%.Moreover, the ISM manufacturing index declined from 59.3% in December to 59.1% in January. But the index remained at its best level since June 2004. Reading above 50 indicates expansion in the activity. Additionally, ISM Prices Index advanced from 68.3% in December to 72.7% in January, reaching its highest levels in seven years.Additionally, the U.S Department of Labor reported that seasonally adjusted initial claims decreased 1,000 to 230,000 in the week ending Jan 27, its lowest level in more than 44 years. Low initial claims indicate a tighter labor market, which along with increase in factory prices cemented rate hike prospects further.High rate hike chances had a positive impact on the Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF), which rose 1%. Some of its key holdings, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS  -  Free Report) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report) rose 1.7% and 1%, respectively.

3175,EBAY,"Bloomberg and Marketwatch are reporting that eBay (EBAY  -  Free Report) has new plans for independent operation after the expiry of its existing operating agreement with PayPal (PYPL  -  Free Report) signed when the two companies separated for greater operational flexibility.Accordingly, it appears that the agreement, which expires in the middle of 2020, will not be renewed. Specifically, what it means is that eBay will not be promoting PayPal to its customers any more, nor will it try to maintain PayPal penetration on its platform at around 80%, Paypal will no longer devote resources to build payments products for eBay. Also, PayPal can build its own marketplace if it so chooses and eBay will be able to build its own payments platform, as required.The news stories say that PayPal will remain a payment option for eBay customers until at least 2023. While they don’t say anything about the current data sharing arrangement between the two, eBay is now expected to take over payments intermediation from PayPal meaning that it will be processing customer payments itself and distributing to sellers. For the purpose, it will be collaborating with a Dutch company called Adyen. eBay expects this to lower payments processing costs for sellers.Chief Financial Officer Scott Schenkel said in a conference call that “In the new intermediation model, we will simplify our relationship with sellers and plan to charge them a single fee for our Marketplace and payment services”. So basically, the fees paid to PayPal earlier will be split between eBay and Adyen and also adjusted against amount due from sellers.This is naturally a huge positive for eBay, which should see a jump in both revenue and profitability.In PayPal’s case, it is of course a big negative. PayPal Chief Executive Daniel Schulman called it “the best possible outcome for PayPal.” CFO John Rainey said that “There’s nothing about what’s been announced today that changes our thoughts on our ability to continue to grow our top line and bottom line after the operating agreement.”PayPal spokeswoman Amanda Miller said, “The planned evolution of our relationship with EBay is consistent with our strategic direction and growth opportunities and does not alter our financial guidance.” These sound like brave words, because it can’t possibly be easy to replace a big and lucrative revenue source. At the same time, nothing is expected to change overnight, so there won’t be any impact on immediate guidance. There’s also nothing to suggest that Paypal won’t be able to acquire the technology or partnerships within the next 5-6 years that can generate continued growth for the company.eBay currently has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) while PayPal has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). So none of these stocks are recommended at the moment. For exposure to the space, it’s better to consider stocks like MeetMe (MEET  -  Free Report), Castlight Health (CSLT  -  Free Report), HubSpot (HUBS  -  Free Report), or Nice Systems (NICE  -  Free Report), all of which have a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Or, simply take a look at the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

3177,EBAY,"Continuing with its upbeat performance for the fourth straight quarter, PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL  -  Free Report), yesterday, reported impressive results for fourth-quarter 2017. Quarterly revenues and earnings both came in above the company’s expectations as well as surpassed the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate.Despite this, shares of PayPal plunged drastically during late-hour trading yesterday as its former parent company — eBay Inc. (EBAY  -  Free Report) — has decided to rely less on the company for processing payments. The online marketplace company, during the fourth-quarter 2017 earnings conference call, announced that it has signed a Dutch payment company — Adyen — as its new primary payment processor.It should be noted that eBay accounts for 13% of PayPal’s total payment volume (TPV), thereby contributing a major portion to its total revenues. Therefore, if this volume tanks by nearly 50% due to the recent development, it might consequently impact PayPal’s top and bottom lines massively in the near term.The stock lost more than 11% of its value during yesterday’s after-hour trade. Notably, PayPal was one of the best performing stocks in 2017.  The stock has appreciated 115.6%, significantly outperforming its industry’s gain of 33.2%, in a year’s time.Let’s discuss quarterly results in detail.RevenuesThe company’s net revenues jumped 25.6% to $3.744 billion, on a year-over-year basis (up 26% on an Fx-neutral basis), beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.631 billion. The figure also came ahead of the company’s guided range of $3.57-$3.63 billion.The results were driven by continued solid performance in global payments, especially mobile. PayPal added record 8.7 million customers in the fourth quarter, taking the total active customer accounts to 227 million.During the quarter, the company entered into agreements with big companies like The Walt Disney Company (DIS  -  Free Report), Dillard’s, Inc. (DDS  -  Free Report) and QVC Group. Moreover, it rolled out its domestic operations in India in the last quarter.Also, the quarter witnessed PayPal’s accelerated push into mobile with One Touch and Venmo continuing to bolster its stake in mobile payments. Venmo users can now pay at more than 2 million PayPal merchants across the United States. One Touch is currently in use by more than 8 million merchants and 80 million consumers.In the reported quarter, mobile made significant contribution to PayPal’s volume growth, processing $48 billion of transactions and accounting for approximately 37% of total payments made on its platform.TPV was $131 billion, increasing 29% year over year on an Fx-neutral basis. The company processed 2.2 billion payment transactions, up 25% year over year. Over the trailing 12 months, payment transaction per active account was up 8% to 33.6.Segment wise, Transaction revenues of $3.22 billion contributed 86% to total revenues and were up 23% on a year-over-year basis. Other value-added services revenues of $523 million contributed the rest and climbed 43% year over year.Geographically, the United States contributed 55% to total revenues, up 30% on a year-over-year basis. International revenues contributed 45% to total revenues and were up 21% year over year on an Fx-neutral basis.Margins and Net IncomeNon-GAAP operating margin of 21.8% expanded 100 basis points (bps) year over year.  Non-GAAP net income of $670 million was up 31% year over year.Non-GAAP earnings per share came in at 55 cents, improving 30% from the year-ago quarter earnings of 42 cents.

The mid-point of the range is better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.55 billion.Non-GAAP earnings are estimated in the band of 52-54 cents per share.

We expect significant additions in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this metric is currently pegged at 170 million.eBay accelerated its partnership deals to boost its marketplace. The company also entered into a partnership with Spring to offer a wide range of apparel and accessories through ebay.com.

(AMZN  -  Free Report) and Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report) and deceleration of growth in the e-commerce market both domestically and internationally.eBay's increased investment toward overall platform technology and slower growth rate compared to its peers are also overhangs. Moreover, eBay's growth continues to suffer due to a weak world economy. The company is heavily dependent on countries outside the United States for its transaction and Internet sales.

3181,EBAY,"Welcome to the latest episode of Full-Court Finance, the podcast from Zacks Investment Research focused on the intersection of sports, business, and the stock market. On this week’s episode, we explore the growing international business of the NBA at the halfway point of the 2017-18 season.Last season, NBA attendance hit a new high for the third year in a row. This year, television ratings are up as much as 25% on ESPN and TNT, while the NFL’s linear TV struggles draw near-constant headlines.The NBA’s multibillion-dollar media rights deals with Disney (DIS  -  Free Report) and Time Warner  helped lift the league’s salary cap almost single-handedly. The league also tipped off its new Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) jersey sponsorship deal this season, which not only marked a 245% increase from the previous deal with Adidas (ADDYY  -  Free Report), but also led the NBA to add sponsorship patches on jerseys for the first time.Japanese tech power Rakuten RKUNY reportedly shelled out $20 million per year to sponsor the Golden State Warriors, while the likes of Goodyear (GT  -  Free Report), General Electric (GE  -  Free Report), Fitbit (FIT  -  Free Report), eBay’s (EBAY  -  Free Report) online ticket giant StubHub have also jumped on the first major U.S. jersey sponsorship deal.Meanwhile, at a time when the average NFL and MLB fan is getting older, the NBA has been able to keep the average age of its fans down. This has been driven in part by a push on social media, where the NBA outpaces the NFL on both Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report) and Instagram (FB  -  Free Report) in terms of followers.The league also recently announced a new partnership with Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) Twitch streaming service as it explores the possibilities of a streaming future. What’s more, through a partnership with Take-Two Interactive (TTWO  -  Free Report), the NBA is set to become the first major North American professional sport with its own esports league later this year.The league and its management have also focused a lot of resources to expand the NBA outside of the U.S., and this effort has helped the NBA become increasingly popular in the world’s second-largest economy, China. But the NBA’s popularity in China might just be heating up as the league continues its attempt to become an expanding global sports powerhouse. If you have any questions about this episode of Full-Court Finance please feel free to shoot us an email over at podcast@zacks.com.

3182,EBAY,"Alibaba Group Holding Limited (BABA  -  Free Report) is expanding its presence in the grocery market. The company plans to open 30 Hema supermarket stores in Beijing by the end of the year.Hema stores allow customers to buy groceries online and have them delivered to them, as well as shop at the store locations. These customers enter by scanning a QR code, select items through a mobile app and pay automatically through Alipay at the checkout.Currently, the Chinese e-commerce giant operates five Hema stores in Beijing, 14 in Shanghai, two in Ningpo, and one each in Hangzhou, Shenzhen, Suzhou, and the Southwestern city of Guiyang.Continuous Focus on New Retail StrategyThe company has been making investments in offline stores for quite some time now. Alibaba purchased 35% stake in department store operator InTime in 2014 and then purchased a 20% stake in retail giant Suning in 2015.This year, it acquired the remaining stake in InTime and privatized the company. The company purchased a stake in grocery chain Sanjiang Shopping Club Co Ltd.  Also, it entered into a strategic partnership with Bailian Group to leverage on its big data capacities and to explore new retail opportunities across outlet design, technology research and development, customer relationship management, supply chain management, payment and logistics.This New Retail strategy is aimed at bridging the gap between online and offline shopping using big data capacity and implementing new ways to evolve across marketing, inventory and distribution networks.The broader goal is to tap China’s massive retail space worth approximately $5 trillion and comprising both online and offline options. Notably, offline retail currently constitutes 85% of the total retail sales in China despite the enormous growth of e-commerce over the last few years.Increased competition from the likes of eBay (EBAY  -  Free Report), Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and JD.com (JD  -  Free Report), and market saturation have forced Alibaba to move beyond hawking goods online.China’s Grocery SegmentFor the last few years, China has been one of the largest grocery markets in the world. The market is also expected to grow at a higher rate than in the United States to become a $1.6 trillion market by 2021. Moreover, the online grocery market in China is expected to increase from around 3% of the total grocery market in 2016 to 6.6% by 2020.Therefore, Alibaba has been gearing up to make the most of the ongoing grocery boom in China and in other countries too.Last year, the company entered into a strategic alliance with Ruentex Group and Auchan Retail S.A. to buy 36.2% stake in China’s leading hypermarket operator, Sun Art Retail Group, from Ruentex for $2.9 billion (HK$22.4 billion) in order to cement its position in the grocery market.The opening of new Hema stores will further expand its presence in the capital and help it make inroads to physical stores.Stock PerformanceShares of Alibaba have steadily treaded higher on a year-to-date basis. While the industry has gained 101.3%, the stock has returned 60.2%.The robust performance of the stock can be attributed to solid growth in its core e-commerce business, diversification into various growing markets, strong mobile strength, international expansion as well as growing cloud-computing services.Bottom LineOnline retail is expected to witness slow growth, while the overall retail market still has plenty of room for growth. This can be attributed to the fact that a large number of customers still prefer to shop offline and will continue to do so going forward.That said, the attempt to merge the online and offline features of retail by giants like Alibaba and Amazon holds promise, as it unites the confidence of shopping offline with the convenience of shopping online. It will not only reshape the retail landscape but also help them fend off competition, if they could manage a first mover advantage.Alibaba Group Holding Limited Price and Consensus  Alibaba Group Holding Limited Price and Consensus | Alibaba Group Holding Limited QuoteZacks Rank Alibaba currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The stock has gained 28.5% year to date, substantially outperforming the 20.7% rally of the S&P 500.The outperformance can be attributed to eBay’s focus on core assets, growing number of partnerships and acquisition, commitment to enhance user experience, opportunities in the fast-growing mobile space, international expansion and a strong balance sheet.Focus on Core BusinesseBay focuses on growing its sellers and active buyers, mainly small- and medium-size merchants, which constitute about 70% of the global retail market. We believe that the standalone eBay offers a convincing opportunity with a desirable marketplace format that has better margins, greater capital efficiency and no inventory risks than most retailers.Alliances Aid GrowthMeaningful partnerships are crucial to the company’s growth. eBay entered into several partnerships in year 2017. On Dec 20, 2017, the company teamed up with Openbay to provide millions of automotive parts and accessories on its online marketplace for auto repair and service. With eBay Motors’s help, businesses can research, source and acquire automotive parts directly through the Openbay dashboard.eBay has been taking several measures to fuel growth in its Marketplaces business. The company recently accelerated its partnership deals to boost its Marketplace. eBay partnered with Spring on Sep 13, 2017 to offer a wide range of apparel and accessories through ebay.com. The company is offering daily deals on Facebook’s Mobile Marketplace and getting access to the latter’s huge user base in return.With Shopify, eBay launched a new sales channel on Jul 13, 2017, an integrated platform that allows Shopify sellers to synchronize inventory information, sell products ordered on eBay and view eBay buyer messages directly from Shopify accounts. This is helping eBay to gain access to sellers on Shopify sellers.User Experience Enhancement Through AIeBay’s interest in artificial intelligence (AI) is constantly growing. It has accelerated its AI efforts through structured data, personalization, image search technology and customer support effort in several areas. The company is leveraging on its structured data and AI  strength to build product catalogs, enhance mobile platform, roll out new browse inspired shopping journeys, enhance customer-to-customer (C2C) business and strengthen its brand.eBay’s 60th acquisition, Terapeak, acquired on Dec 13 2017, crunches data related to supply, demand and pricing. Its platform helps companies to decide what to sell and how to price it. The company also acquired Expertmaker and SalesPredict to strengthen its artificial intelligence, machine learning and structured data efforts. eBay also acquired Corrigon Ltd., which contributes significantly to its Marketplace platform's structured data initiative. The company also acquired Ticket Utils and TicketbiS, both of which are helping the company to improve seller tools.These initiatives continue to boost eBay’s unique capabilities and give it an edge over competitors.Strong Balance SheeteBay had around $6 billion in cash and short-term investments at the end third quarter of 2017. eBay consistently converts a portion of the cash on hand to investments.

3184,EBAY,"Alibaba Group Holding Limited (BABA  -  Free Report) has made yet another move to strengthen its presence in the automotive space.The company has teamed up with Ford Motor Company (F  -  Free Report) to explore new opportunities in the connected car space. The deal is in line with the Chinese conglomerate’s strategy of gradually merging online and offline retail.Following the news, the company’s share price surged 1.07%, eventually closing at $174.47. Also, on a year-to-date basis, shares of Alibaba have steadily treaded higher. The stock has returned 98.7% compared with the industry’s gain of 57%.DetailsThe e-commerce giant has signed a three-year agreement with the Dearborn-based automaker to identify new ways of selling vehicles in China.Per the deal, Ford will use Alibaba’s T-Mall online marketplace to sell cars in China. The automaker would use Alibaba's operating system AliOS, Alibaba Cloud, digital marketing system Alimama and retail platform Tmall.Besides sales, the two will work together in many other areas such as cloud computing for big data analysis, artificial intelligence (AI), mobility, and connectivity.Daniel Zhang, CEO of Alibaba Group, said, “Alibaba is excited to redefine the consumer journey and user experience for automobiles together with Ford Motor Group,” adding, “Our data-driven technology and platform will expand the definition of car ownership beyond just having a mode of transportation and into a new medium for a smart lifestyle.""New Retail to Get a BoostThe retail giant, which gives stiff competition to Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and ebay (EBAY  -  Free Report) in China, has a broader objective of tapping China’s massive retail space that includes both online and offline forms. Notably, offline retail currently constitutes 84% of total retail sales in China despite the enormous growth of e-commerce in the last few years.Keeping this in mind, the company is working on the development of what it calls “New Retail” to bridge the gap between online and offline shopping using its big data capacity. Alibaba expects that the system will give brick-and-mortar retailers new opportunities to evolve across marketing, inventory and distribution networks.Alibaba’s partnership with Ford is also a part of its New Retail strategy. It plans to leverage on its big data capacities to explore new retail opportunities in this space. Although people prefer touching, feeling and driving cars before buying them, doing the basic research and purchasing online would be more appealing than visiting multiple showrooms.Looking AheadMuch like other technology companies, Alibaba too is making all efforts to boost its presence in the fast growing auto industry.In this regard, Alibaba first teamed up with SAIC Motor last year to explore the connected car space. Reportedly, more than 400,000 vehicles across China’s roads are powered by Alibaba's operating system AliOS today.Now, it is not clear if Ford cars would be powered by AliOS. Nonetheless, this is the first deal between Alibaba and an automaker from outside China. Not to mention, in the process, the Alibaba is going bring even more pain to those who continue to bet against it.That said, chances of Alibaba making an attempt to collaborate with other big players like General Motors (GM) and Honda Motors to give tough competition to its peers, too are high.It would be interesting to see how the competitive atmosphere builds up in China, as Alibaba places itself in direct competition with early movers like Apple, Baidu and LeECO. Nevertheless, we agree that Alibaba's latest venture with Ford will allow it to embed deeper into the new retail revolution and grab a greater share in the auto industry.Alibaba Group Holding Limited Price and Consensus  Alibaba Group Holding Limited Price and Consensus | Alibaba Group Holding Limited QuoteZacks RankAlibaba currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

3185,EBAY,"Shopify Inc. (SHOP  -  Free Report) recently announced that its worldwide merchant base of over 500,000 sold more than $1 billion worth of gross merchandise volume (GMV) during the Black Friday and Cyber Monday (BFCM) weekend. Merchants also generated above $1 million transactions in a minute during the peak hour.As a result, management was extremely positive about the strong response received by the small business owners and entrepreneurs who list their products on their portal, especially during a time which has always been under the dominance of prominent retailers.Shopify noted that UK, Spain and South Africa were the top international sellers. Currently, the sales figure was the highest in the United States, California, New York and Texas. Mobile sales accounted for around 64% of the total figure, which had 10% year-over-year increase. In terms of sales volume, apparels, accessories and house wares were the leading product lines.Recent Upgrades of the PlatformPrior to the BFCM weekend, Shopify’s platform was upgraded with enhanced features that aided the merchants during the sale. In fact, the company unveiled the BFCM tool box to assist merchants better connect with the customers.In third-quarter 2017, the company’s Instagram channel was unveiled connecting merchants with a huge base of monthly active users. The newly launched eBay Inc. (EBAY  -  Free Report) sales channel has also been beneficial.The shipping partnerships with the likes of UPS and DHL Express are added positives. The application called Live View helped in real-time reporting of the performance of the stores. Also, the discounting procedure was simplified.In addition, the company’s new application called Buy Online for Shopify POS that enabled shoppers to try products in person and then buy those at a later convenient date is encouraging.Furthermore, the improvisations of the checkout process by including features like Google Autocomplete and Checkout with Phone have made it easy for the consumers to use the platform.Shopify Inc. Revenue (TTM) Shopify Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Shopify Inc. QuoteShopify’s Growing Merchant BaseShopify continues to launch a number of merchant-friendly applications to meet the requirements of a dynamic retail environment, thereby adding to its merchant base. This, in turn, gets reflected in the compnay’s year-over-year top-line growth. The company’s effective partner ecosystem also helps it identify and reach out to the merchants, which otherwise unreachable.In the third quarter, the company added quite a few prominent brands like Phoenix Suns, RBS, Josie Maran and Rebecca Minkoff. Consumer packaged goods providers like Gurmay, Mai, Blue Diamond Growers and Beer Nuts also enriched the merchant base.We believe the company’s easy-to-use upgrades and expanding merchant base have boosted the GMV, which soared 69% from the year-ago quarter to $6.4 billion in the preceding quarter. This trend is anticipated to continue, thereby aiding the company to perform impressively, going ahead.Zacks Rank & Key PicksShopify carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include NetApp, Inc.

3186,EBAY,"With a digital transformation in shopping, bricks-and-mortar retailers are struggling. Feeble sales are forcing them to shut stores or file for bankruptcy, while e-commerce retailers are making hay.In order to capitalize on this trend, ProShares has launched two retail disruption ETFs, namely ProShares Decline of the Retail Store ETF (EMTY  -  Free Report) and ProShares Long Online/Short Stores ETF (CLIX  -  Free Report), designed to benefit from the move toward online shopping and shift from physical retail stores. Here’s an insight into these newly created ETFs:EMTY in FocusThis fund seeks capital appreciation from the decline of bricks and mortar retailers through short (inverse) exposure to the Solactive-ProShares Bricks and Mortar Retail Store Index, which consists of retailers that rely principally on revenues from physical stores. The index holds a well-diversified basket of 56 stocks, with none accounting for more than 1.79% of assets. From an industrial exposure, apparels takes the largest share at 28.6% followed by department stores at 10.7% (read: Online vs. Offline Retail: Recent ETF Winners).The new fund comes with an expense ratio of 0.65%. CLIX in FocusThis fund seeks to benefit from both outperforming online and underperforming physical retailers through long/short strategy. It combines the 100% long position in retailers that primarily sell online or through other non-store channels with a 50% short position in those that rely principally on physical stores by tracking the performance of the ProShares Long Online/Short Stores Index.  The approach reduces equity market exposure and results in less volatility than long-only equity strategies. The ETF charges 65 bps in annual fees from investors.How do they fit in today’s portfolio?The ETFs could intrigue investors seeking to benefit from the changing retail landscape from physical stores to online. This is especially true given that bricks-and-mortar retailers are seeing a decline in revenue and profit margins to levels not seen since recession. Over 30 major retailers have declared bankruptcy in the past three years and more than 8,600 retail stores could close this year in the United States. Additionally, major players like J.C. Penney (JCP  -  Free Report) and Macy’s (M  -  Free Report) are struggling to remain viable.On the other hand, e-commerce has been rising rapidly on shoppers’ online binge. eMarketer estimates that U.S. retail ecommerce sales will grow 15.8% in 2017 to reach $452.76 billion, making up 9.0% of total retail sales. Another firm Forrester projects U.S. online sales to grow 13% year over year in 2017, which is five times faster than the projected offline sales growth, and in line with the National Retail Federation’s estimates. It expects online sales to account for 17% of all U.S. retail sales by 2022, up from the projected 12.7% for 2017. Amazon is expected to be a major driver of online sales, followed by eBay (EBAY  -  Free Report) and Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report) (read: Amazon ETFs to Buy on Q3 Blowout Results).Currently, the retail sector is piping hot and gaining momentum on a string of better-than-expected results. The holiday fervor is an add-on.ETF CompetitionThere is increased appetite for niche funds due to the lack of real competitors to the unique products. However, Amplify Online Retail ETF (IBUY  -  Free Report), which offers a long position to the online retail space, could give tough competition to CLIX. IBUY has accumulated $132.9 million in AUM and charges 65 bps in annual fees. It has gained about 37% year to date.A handful of other retail ETFs — SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT  -  Free Report), VanEck Vectors Retail ETF (RTH  -  Free Report), PowerShares Dynamic Retail Portfolio (PMR  -  Free Report) and First Trust Nasdaq Retail ETF (FTXD  -  Free Report) — seek to offer exposure to both the physical stores and online retail space (see: all the Consumer Discretionary ETFs here).Bottom LineIt will not be difficult for the new ETFs to garner sufficient investor interest in changing the retail landscape and generate decent total returns net of expense ratio. Investors as it is are looking for exposure to this underserved corner of the retail space.Further, the new products would definitely get the first-mover advantage, as the duo is the first set of ETFs targeting a decline in bricks-and-mortar stocks and surge in e-commerce retail space.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

Notably, offline retail currently constitutes 85% of total retail sales in China despite the enormous growth of e-commerce over the last few years.Alibaba Group Holding Limited Net Income (TTM) Alibaba Group Holding Limited Net Income (TTM) | Alibaba Group Holding Limited QuoteThe effort is already paying off as the company has started operating Hema convenience stores that allows customers to enter by scanning a QR code, select items and pay automatically through Alipay at the checkout.Increased competition from the likes of eBay (EBAY  -  Free Report), Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and JD.com (JD  -  Free Report), and market saturation have forced Alibaba to move beyond hawking goods online. The company has been making investments in offline stores for quite some time now. It purchased 35% stake in department store operator InTime in 2014 and then purchased a 20% stake in retail giant Suning in 2015.This year, it acquired the remaining stake in InTime and privatized the company. It purchased a stake in grocery chain Sanjiang Shopping Club Co Ltd.  The company entered into a strategic partnership with Bailian Group to leverage on its big data capacities and to explore new retail opportunities across outlet design, technology research and development, customer relationship management, supply chain management, payment and logistics.Last WordsOnline retail is expected to see slow growth, while the overall retail market still has plenty of room for growth.

Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Our style scores indicate that the stock is more suitable for momentum investors than value investors.OutlookThe stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

These panels generate more than 3.5 MW of combined peak power, thus helping to reduce the amount of electricity drawn from the utility.Consequently, the online retailer has been increasing its investments to build and modernize fulfillment centers primarily to cut shipping costs and speed up delivery. Currently, the company has three fulfillment facilities in Maryland including two in the Baltimore city limits.In 2016, Amazon’s capital expenditure increased 51% on a year-over-year basis. A major part of it was utilized in the construction of 26 fulfillment centers and deployment of robotics technology inside them.Amazon.com, Inc. Price and Consensus  Amazon.com, Inc. Price and Consensus | Amazon.com, Inc. QuoteBottom LineFulfillment centers help Amazon in storage and shipping of products, besides handling returns quickly. In fact, these are important in order to cater its customers’ needs in a better way.Additionally, small retailers, who are unable to provide relatively cost-efficient shipping, are signing up for Amazon’s fulfillment services. Third parties also avail the company’s warehouses and shipping services. These, in turn, are expected to help the company boost revenues and drive expansion in the long haul.However, heavy investments in these arrangements (and several other initiatives) are keeping Amazon’s margins under pressure, thereby affecting its bottom line. Also, Amazon’s retail business is currently facing stiff competition from Alibaba (BABA  -  Free Report) and eBay (EBAY  -  Free Report), among others.Zacks Rank & Stock to ConsiderAmazon carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

3192,EBAY,"The stock market’s tech benchmark set a new record for all-time highs in a calendar year. While Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) helped Nasdaq reach a record close, other Silicon Valley tech stocks continue to hover near the mark. The Cupertino-based iPhone maker reported blowout earnings results, while such an encouraging trend is noticeable for the entire tech sector.Some market pundits believe that tech stocks are riding the years-long economic expansion, while most of them attribute a part of this uptick to Trump administration’s pro-business policies including tax cuts, deregulation and outlays on infrastructure.Needless to say, tech stocks are preferred by astute investors due to their proprietary technological expertise and heavy cash balances. These companies also relish high barriers to entry, which position them for faster growth in the market. Given such bullish trends, investing in some rock-solid Silicon Valley stocks for better gains seems judicious.Nasdaq Scales Record High on Apple’s SuccessThe tech-laden Nasdaq Composite trumped all records on Nov 3. The index registered its 63rd record-closing high of this year that beat the previous record of 62 highs in a calendar year. The index has also outpaced the other major indices so far this year.While the Nasdaq has rallied almost 26% on a year-to-date basis, the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones gained nearly 16% and 19%, respectively, over the same period. In fact, the tech-stacked indexes’ year-to-date gains are the best since the dot-com boom of the late 1990s.Stellar quarterly results from tech-bigwig Apple helped the Nasdaq scale a record high. The iPhone maker gained 2.6% and flirted with a valuation at $900 billion. The world’s most valuable company has soared 48.9% so far this year.Apple’s fiscal fourth-quarter sales of $52 billion topped analysts’ expectations. Almost half of the sales came from iPhone. Chief Executive Tim Cook declared that iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus sales were the best ever in the company’s history. Its service units that comprise iTunes, Apple Music, Apple Pay and Apple Care, to name a few, also raked in record-high revenues.Profits also rose to $10.71 billion, while the executives showed more optimism over the current quarter. They raised the fiscal first-quarter sales guidance from $84 billion to $87 billion. This has ward off fears related to the company’s flagship iPhone X production, priced at $1000. This is, incidentally, the most exorbitant iPhone model in the company’s history (read more: Apple Stock Pops on Q4 Earnings Beat, Strong Guidance).Blowout Tech EarningsApple isn’t the only Silicon Valley tech stock moving north this season. Better-than-expected quarterly results from other tech giants like Google-parent Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL  -  Free Report) and Microsoft Corporation (MSFT  -  Free Report) also helped drive the Nasdaq to a record high.Alphabet’s third-quarter earnings of $9.57 increased 91% sequentially and 32% year over year. Net revenues of $22.27 billion increased 6.5% sequentially and 21.9% year over year. While Google Cloud generated substantial revenue growth, it continues to enjoy strength in the mobile platform (read more: Alphabet Beats Earnings, Revenue Estimates in Q3).Microsoft reported first-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings of 84 cents per share, up 16.7% on a year-over-year basis. Revenues of $24.54 billion increased almost 12% from the year-ago quarter. The company was also successful in achieving its goal of attaining $20 billion in annualized revenues from its commercial cloud business (read more: Microsoft Q1 Earnings Beat on Strong Azure Growth).Shares of Alphabet and Microsoft climbed more than 30% so far this year. To top it, Netflix, Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report), Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO  -  Free Report), eBay Inc (EBAY  -  Free Report) and NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) continue to hover near record highs as the tech sector displays strength in the third-quarter earnings season.Total earnings for the tech companies’ third-quarter earnings so far are up 22.4% from the same period last year on 9.3% higher revenues, with 81.8% beating EPS estimates and 86.4% surpassing revenue estimates (read more: The Tech Sector’s Impressive Earnings Power on Display).Tax Cuts – A Major Boost to Software & Semiconductor StocksHopes of pro-business legislation promised by Trump have, mostly, supported the gains among both the manufacturers of the internal technologies — the semiconductor makers and the software industry.As per Statista, corporate taxation rate in the United States is among the worlds’ highest. This explains why most of the tech majors stash cash overseas. The proposed tax plan will lower taxes from 35% to 20%. As a result, tech companies’ after-tax earnings will improve and will lead to repatriation of trillions of dollars held abroad by such companies. Tech companies can use this extra cash for R&D and M&As.Tech players including Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Facebook Inc (FB  -  Free Report) and Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) have billions of dollars in cash reserves parked abroad. In fact, a Nikkei Asian Review showed that combined overseas cash reserves for such companies exceeded the Japanese government’s overall tax revenues in fiscal 2016.5 Top Silicon Valley Stocks to Buy NowInvestors, thus, should double down on the hottest Silicon Valley tech stocks after they cross one record after another on earnings strength, primarily, backed by favorable government policy.

3193,EBAY,"(0:45) - Online Retail: Are We Still In Early Stages?(2:10) - Who Are The Growth Drivers of Online Retail?(4:05) - Who Is Struggling With Online Retail?(8:45) - How Much More Growth Can We Expect?(11:10) - Amplify Online Retail ETF: IBUY(15:00) - Marketplace Sector Growth & Company Selection For IBUY(19:25) - What's In Store For The Online Retail Sector?(22:30) - Episode Roundup: Podcast@Zacks.comRetail has been an area that investors have avoided for much of 2017, but is that fair to the online segment of the industry? This corner of the market still has great growth prospects and is really the only hope for many struggling brick and mortar players right now.To discuss this trend, we have Christian Magoon, the founder and CEO of Amplify Funds, to guide us through the space for today’s Dutram Report. Christian’s firm has an Online Retail ETF (IBUY  -  Free Report), so he is definitely well versed in what is going on the world of online commerce these days.TrendsFirst off, we discuss an incredible stat that less than 10% of U.S. retail sales in 2016 came from online purchases. I was quite shocked by this, but Christian and I go over how the online retail boom may actually just be in its first few innings, and that there is plenty of room to grow in this space.In particular, we highlight the trends of growth in the grocery market. Obviously, groceries account for a huge level of retail purchases, but we are quickly seeing companies like Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Wal-Mart (WMT  -  Free Report) bring this to the online world as well.But if you just thought this was a domestic story, you’ll definitely want to listen to this podcast. In it, we also take a look at some foreign markets which are really embracing online shopping, and which areas are a bit behind the times. In fact, the U.S. trails a number of countries (including China, the UK, South Korea, and Germany) when it comes to the retail ecommerce as a percentage of total retail sales, so you can argue that many are quite a bit ahead of us when it comes to ecommerce adoption.The FundBut for investors looking to play the growth in online shopping, how do you choose? Sure, some investors might just want to buy Amazon, but Christian argues that might not be the best way forward for most. Instead, a more diversified approach that can get some of the higher growth names may be a better way to play the space.We take a look at some of the top players in this segment, as well as some key distinctions between the key companies here. For example, IBUY is actually broken down into three groups; traditional, travel, and marketplace. We highlight some of the most important names in each, but I am sure you can guess that firms like eBay (EBAY  -  Free Report) make it for the marketplace side, while Expedia (EXPE  -  Free Report) is an obvious addition for the travel segment.Another important factor to note about IBUY is that the fund isn’t just focused on companies selling clothes or other items on the internet. It is instead a diversified play on companies that use the internet to get at least 70% of their revenues. That is why we see companies such as Netflix (NFLX) or GrubHub (GRUB  -  Free Report) on the list, despite the fact that most don’t really think of them as ‘retail’. So, in many ways, I like to think of this as an internet consumer ETF more than anything, but check out the podcast for a more thorough discussion of this important aspect of IBUY.PerformanceAnd as you might expect, IBUY has been able to trounce its main competitor, the SPDR Retail ETF (XRT  -  Free Report) from a performance perspective. The heavy presence of brick and mortar companies in XRT easily dragged it down against the market and other consumer counterparts, while IBUY didn’t face the same issues.Clearly, this could be a fund to watch for investors seeking a play on the consumer market, but are worried about the ‘Armageddon’ happening in the world of traditional retail these days. All that, and more, are discussed on this edition of the Dutram Report, so make sure to listen to the podcast for additional information!Bottom LineBut what do you think about the online retail market? Do you agree that it is more than just Amazon? Make sure to write us in at podcast @ zacks.com or find me on Twitter @EricDutram to give us your thoughts on this, or anything else in the fund market.But for more news and discussion regarding the world of investing, make sure to be on the lookout for the next edition of the Dutram Report (each and every Thursday!) and check out the many other great Zacks podcasts as well!

3194,EBAY,"Shares of PayPal (PYPL  -  Free Report) surged over 2.50% to reach a new all-time high on Thursday, and now many investors might be wondering if they should get in on the digital payment company, despite it breaking through a brand new threshold.People use cash less and less these days, especially in the developed world where mobile, online, and contactless payment options have become normal.Fintech and mobile payments platforms are tangible, usable, and practical for the average person. This makes companies that operate in this sector potentially very valuable, both today and in the future.PayPal is one of the original online and digital payment companies, and since spinning off from eBay (EBAY  -  Free Report) a few years ago, the firm has gone on quite the run and now boasts over 210 million active accounts.The companysaw its stock price pop to hit $65.63 per share on Thursday, a new all-time intraday trading high. Let’s take a look at some of what the company has done recently, as well as some key fundamental metrics, to see if investors might want to invest in the digital payment firm.Recent Moves PayPal owns mobile peer-to-peer payment giant Venmo, which is widely popular with millennials and has experienced massive year-over-year growth, and the company now partners with credit card giants Visa (V  -  Free Report) and Mastercard (MA  -  Free Report)—where previously they were at odds.In August, Mastercard introduced a new PayPal Cashback credit card. On Thursday, PayPal and Mastercard announced that they expanded their partnership to include more services on a larger global scale in Canada, Europe, Latin America, the Caribbean, the Middle East, and Africa.“Together we expect to accelerate digital payment adoption across the world, improve the payment experience online, in-app and in store, and empower millions of consumers to seamlessly manage and move their money,” PayPal Chief Commercial Officer Gary Marino said in a statement.These new relationships have helped PayPal grow more quickly. On top of that, PayPal has struck deals with over 20 new partners,including Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), Baidu (BIDU  -  Free Report), and JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report), all within the last year and a half.Fundamentals PayPal’s second quarter saw the company’s revenues pop 18% to hit $3.14 billion, while the company’s earnings jumped 27%. PayPal is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) with an overall VGM grade of “C.”PayPal might not be the most attractive investment for value-minded investors, as it is currently trading at almost 35x earnings. This, however, does mark a massive discount to the industry, which is trading at 62x earnings—its younger competitor, Square (SQ  -  Free Report), has a P/E ratio of 160.39.The company’s P/B ratio of 5.15 is not great either, but again, it is comparable to the “Internet – Software” industry average.The digital payment solution firm’s 13.91% cash flow growth helps demonstrates that the company is healthy compared to many of its peers that have more cash going out than coming in.PayPal’s revenues are projected to gain 18.99% this quarter and gain 18.62% on the year to hit as high as $12.94 billion, based on our current consensus estimates. The “Internet – Software” industry is set to experience 9.73% year-over-year sales growth. PayPal’s quarterly earnings are expected to pop 24.60% this quarter and 22.45% for the year.These substantial gains are projected even though, within the last 60 days, PayPal has received eight downward earnings estimate revisions against only one positive change. However, since spinning off in 2015, PayPal has beat quarterly expectations every time.Bottom LineIn a mobile-centered and digital world, fintech and online payment companies will be positioned to cash in on the future of transactions. PayPal is a pioneer in the industry and might just be a company investors consider now—and down the road.4 Stocks to Watch after the Massive Equifax HackCybersecurity stocks spiked on recent news of a data breach affecting 143 million Americans.

Non-GAAP earnings are expected within 46-48 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 48 cents. GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations are expected in the range of 30-32 cents.The company is expected to report third-quarter results on Oct 18.To ConcludeeBay is one of the largest online retailers in the world.

3196,EBAY,"On Sep 26, we issued an updated research report on internet-based social expression and personal publishing service provider, Shutterfly, Inc. (SFLY  -  Free Report).Efforts to Improve Operational EfficiencyShutterfly has undertaken various structural changesas announced in fourth-quarter 2016. In fact, the company plans to retire many of its other brandsin order to focus more on profitable and cost-effective brands. Also, the existing customers will be migrated to one common website and all other websites will be shut down as has already been done for its Tiny Prints brand.Thus, Shutterfly plans to invest in a single Consumer platform with all customers gaining from investment in the Shutterfly.com site in the near term. This, in turn, is likely to reduce complexities of usage to a large extent, consequently increasing customer satisfaction.Additionally, one of the largest structural changes made by the company is to reduce workforce by approximately 13% or 260 employees. This is expected to result in an annualized cost decrease of roughly $25 million.Meanwhile, Shutterfly signed a follow-on deal with Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE  -  Free Report) in the last quarterto upgrade its printer fleet. Markedly, the underlying lease in the deal is expected to result in expense savings of $15 million over the next five years. Going forward, these higher quality and more efficient printers are anticipated to help improve Shutterfly’scost structure while using automation to reduce its reliance on seasonal labor.Furthermore, the company intends to improve operational efficiency and open new manufacturing facilities or consolidate the existing ones for future expansion.Added Growth InitiativesShutterfly is well focused on product innovation as a core part of its strategy to drive sales growth. It plans to re-invest in Tiny Prints as its premium cards & stationery brand and create a Tiny Prints boutique on a dedicated tab on Shutterfly.com. Additionally, the company intends to focus on the new Shutterfly Wedding Store as a part of its wedding strategy in the long run.Last year, Shutterflyadded more products to its newly launched statement gifts category, besides enhancing home décor category as well as cards and stationery category.In fact, the company is making progress with its Shutterfly 3.0 initiative, which encompasses a new integrated photo management solution also called the All New Shutterfly. This photo management service is anticipated to deepen the company’s relationships with its customers and drive sales over time.Furthermore, the company’s focus on improving technology-related offerings seems to bode well. Evidently, Shutterflyhas been continuously enhancing its mobile experience and optimized navigation, and also working on the look and functionality of its websites.Meanwhile, the company’s improved mobile app continues to drive a record number of customers, thus expanding its mobile footprint.In the second-quarter 2017, the company saw one million downloads of its app on the back of successful marketing efforts. Moreover, mobile sales that include both mobile web and mobile app, accounted for 25% of the Shutterfly brand revenues in the quarter, which was an increase of more than 600 basis points year over year.Overall, mobile continues to grow at a significantly faster rate than the company’s desktop business, and is expected to become an important growth driver in the near term.Potential HeadwindsShutterfly generally incurs loss in the first three quarters and makes profit in the final quarter of every year because of the seasonal nature of its business. Also, it is affected by vacation and other travel trends as these drive digital camera sales. Therefore, weaknesses in the travel industry owing to macro-economic slowdown or political instability can hurt the company’s business.Additionally, competition from other companies selling greeting cards or stationery at highly competitive prices on eBay Inc. (EBAY  -  Free Report) and Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report), is a threat to Shutterfly’s topline.Notably, the company has been incurring higher costs pertaining to the accelerated development of new production facilities along with a rise in the manufacturing, labor and training costs. In fact, with the announcement of the major restructuring goals, the company expects to incur restructuring charges ranging from $15 million to $17.5 million in 2017. These costs could weigh on the company’s margins.Shutterfly’s revenue growth has also been slow over the past couple of years. This is because the company had spread its resources thin across many businesses, brands and platforms, making it impossible to dedicate the right level of resource to each one.Although the company has undertaken huge structural changes to this end, 2017 is expected to be a transition year for them, with different brands transitioning at different times over the course of the first three quarters. Thus, the company projects net revenues in 2017 to grow a meager 1% over last year.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

3198,EBAY,"Groupon Inc. (GRPN  -  Free Report) is set to release third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 1.Last quarter, the company reported non-GAAP earnings of 2 cents per share. The reported figure was much better than non-GAAP loss per share of 4 cents in the previous quarter and also came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of break-even. The sequential improvement in the bottom line can primarily be attributed to the company’s streamlining activities.Revenues of $662.6 million missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $665 million and also declined 8.4% on a year-over-year basis. The decline in the top line was mostly due to the company’s decreasing international presence.Gross margin increased 590 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis to 49.5% in the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 310 bps to 8%, reflecting the successful implementation of the company’s streamlining strategies.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to Consider    Groupon’s partnership with Grubhub (GRUB  -  Free Report) in the month of July, enabling customers to order food delivery from around 55,000 restaurant partners of Grubhub via Groupon platform is expected to be a tailwind for the company’s top line. However, competition from giants like eBay (EBAY  -  Free Report) and Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) remains a concern.Nevertheless, the rollout of the company’s new card-linked platform, Groupon+ that replaces the voucher system and makes discounting processes easy, is expected to be a positive.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues is pegged at $645 million while earnings are projected to be a penny per share. The revenue estimate for North America is around $445 million.Notably, Groupon expects EBITDA to decline sequentially as the company plans to continue its investments in marketing and offline campaigning activities.Groupon, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Groupon, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Groupon, Inc. QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Groupon is likely to beat estimates this quarter.

3199,EBAY,"Alibaba Group Holding Limited (BABA  -  Free Report) is increasing its stake in its logistics affiliate Cainiao Smart Logistics Network Limited with an $807 million (RMB5.3 billion) additional investment. The company also plans to invest $15.2 billion (RMB100 billion) in Cainiao over the next five years.The Chinese e-commerce goliath noted in a press release that these investments are part of its bid to strengthen its global logistics network and implement its New Retail Strategy.The company expects these moves to help it gain greater logistics efficiency, deliver improved consumer and merchant experience and lower costs. Alibaba aims to deliver orders within 24 hours in China and 72 hours anywhere in the world.The transaction, which is expected to close in October next year, will raise Alibaba’s Ownership in Cainiao from 47% to 51%. Further, Alibaba will get an additional seat in Cainiao’s board, raising its representation to four seats out of seven. It will also consolidate financial results of Cainiao into its own books and report them as part of its core commerce segment, post the transaction.We observe that shares of Alibaba have gained a massive 93.1% year to date, significantly outperforming the industry’s 45.2% rally.Accelerating the Logistics PushHaving been around long enough to establish logistical relationships through Cainiao, and a solid core commerce model, Alibaba has been guzzling data that it is in an increasingly better position to use for improving customer experience and feeding its AI initiatives.The new move is expected to help Alibaba do more on that apart from strengthening its global logistics infrastructure.Alibaba Group Holding Limited Net Income (TTM) Alibaba Group Holding Limited Net Income (TTM) | Alibaba Group Holding Limited QuoteNew Retail Strategy in FocusAlibaba, which gives tough competition to Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), eBay (EBAY  -  Free Report) and JD.com (JD  -  Free Report) in China is working on the development of what it calls “New Retail” to bridge the gap between online and offline shopping using its big data capacity.The new investments are expected to boost this innovation strategy by allowing it to increase R&D spending in logistics data technology, smart warehousing and delivery.Alibaba currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

3200,EBAY,"eBay Inc. (EBAY  -  Free Report) and Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) have reportedly partnered to offer daily deals on Facebook’s Mobile Marketplace.Per a report from The Verge, the collaboration is in a test phase and aimed at assessing whether people visiting Facebook’s Marketplace are interested in discounted products.The new feature is currently available to select users who can browse for eBay deals on Facebook's app. However, they can check out only through eBay’s site.Investors will surely keep an eye on such moves to see whether these can boost eBay’s stock that has underperformed the industry year to date. It has returned 18.7% compared with the industry’s gain of 46.4%.Deal BenefitseBay will get another way to boost its Marketplace by offering its platform features to Facebook and getting access to the latter’s huge user base in return.eBay Inc. Revenue (TTM) eBay Inc. Revenue (TTM) | eBay Inc. QuoteWith a similar intention, eBay struck a deal with Shopify (SHOP  -  Free Report) last month. The duo launched a new sales channel, an integrated platform that allows Shopify sellers to synchronize inventory information, sell products ordered on eBay and view eBay buyer messages directly from Shopify accounts.eBay is currently re-platforming itself by building product catalogs on structured data, enhancing mobile platform, rolling out new browse inspired shopping journeys and strengthening its brand. It appears that with moves like these, eBay is trying to put these efforts to gainful use.As far as Facebook is concerned, the deal will help it go beyond peer-to-peer sales by leveraging on eBay’s scale, brand awareness and advanced e-commerce capacities.Our TakeFacebook launched its Marketplace last year. It allows users to buy and sell items within their local communities. It’s been considered as a competitor to eBay’s Classifieds platforms that provides a very important way to capture the local customer-to-customer opportunity and often represents customers who are selling items more suited to a local transaction.It appears that Facebook is gradually realizing the difficulty in beating eBay’s strong position and unique capabilities in the space and better off partnering with the market leader.This week, Facebook expanded its Marketplace to 17 European countries - France, Spain, Germany, Italy, Finland, Denmark, Portugal, the Netherlands, Ireland, Sweden, Norway, the Czech Republic, Austria, Hungary, Luxembourg, Switzerland and Belgium.Zacks Rank and Stock to ConsiderCurrently, eBay has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

3202,EBAY,"U.S. stocks were little changed on Monday as investors refrained from placing big bets ahead of a busy earnings week. Investors geared up for key quarterly earnings results of major players including Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS  -  Free Report), Bank of America Corp (BAC  -  Free Report), Microsoft Corporation (MSFT  -  Free Report), International Business Machines Corp. (IBM  -  Free Report), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report), QUALCOMM, Inc. (QCOM  -  Free Report) and eBay Inc (EBAY  -  Free Report) that will be released this week. Netflix, Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report) is expected to report earnings after the market closes on Monday. While the Dow and the S&P 500 ended in the red after hitting record highs on Friday, the Nasdaq was able to eke out slight gains and notched a 7-day winning streak.For a look at the issues currently facing the markets, make sure to read today’s Ahead of Wall Street article.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) declined a meagre 0.04% to close at 21,629.72. The S&P 500 dropped just 0.01% to finish at 2,459.14, with utilities leading advancers and health care lagging. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index, however, gained 0.03% to close at 6,314.43.

You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It’s All About EarningsGiven the stock market’s record run this year, Wall Street is keeping a close eye on quarterly earnings.  This could be an excellent earnings season for the S&P 500, which in turn will boost its operating earnings per share for the trailing 12 months. Improved second-quarter economic growth, strong manufacturing and service surveys, and a moderate uptick in wage growth are expected to help Corporate America post relatively high profit margins in Q2. Earnings growth is expected to be led by energy, financials and information technology (read more: Wall Street to See Terrific Q2 Earnings: 5 Top Gainers).According to estimates, total second-quarter earnings for the S&P 500 cohort are expected to be up 6.6% from same period last year on 4.5% higher revenues. This would follow earnings growth of 13.3% in Q1 on 7% revenue growth, the highest in at least two years. Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research, further added that history shows the final tally will be better in Q2 “as actual EPS exceeded initial estimates in each of the last 21 quarters and have done so by an average of 3.6 percentage points.”If we move beyond Q2, total earnings for the S&P 500 cohort are anticipated to increase 6.1% on 4.5% higher revenues in Q3 and gain by 9.7% on 5.2% higher revenues in Q4. For the entire year, total earnings for the index are expected to be up 7.4% on 4.1% higher revenues. This will be way more than 1% earnings growth on 2% higher revenues recorded last year (read more: Bank Earnings in the Spotlight).Meanwhile, the world’s largest asset manager BlackRock, Inc.’s (BLK  -  Free Report) quarterly profit came in below expectations. BlackRock reported second-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of $5.24 per share, which lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.39. Lower-than-expected results were primarily due to a rise in operating expenses and lower investment advisory performance fees (read more: BlackRock Q2 Earnings Lag Estimates as Expenses Rise).Stocks that made HeadlinesSpirit Airlines June Load Factor Falls, Q2 TRASM View RaisedSpirit Airlines (SAVE  -  Free Report)  saw a 17% rise in traffic (measured in Revenue Passenger Miles or RPMs) to approximately 2.2 billion in Jun 2017 on a year-over-year basis.

Currently, Spring offers clothes from more than 1,500 brands including Urban Outfitters, Michael Kors, Gucci, Prada and Coach.Investors will surely keep an eye on such deals to see whether these can boost eBay’s stock that has underperformed the industry year to date.

3204,EBAY,"Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) plans to further expand its presence in Michigan by opening another fulfillment center in the Charter Township of Shelby, MI.Notably, Amazon has underperformed the industry on a year-to-date basis. Shares of the company have gained 31.6% compared with the industry’s growth of 51.3% in the same time period.More About the DevelopmentThe new 1-million-square-foot fulfillment center is expected to create 1,000 new full-time jobs, once the site gets operational in 2018.This new Michigan facility will focus on large items like household decor, sporting equipment and gardening tools. Amazon stated that employees working in the facility will not only be entitled to get competitive wages, but will also receive other benefits such as generous maternity and parental leaves. The company will also offer 95% tuition reimbursement to its employees.Meanwhile, Amazon has been increasing its investments to build and modernize fulfillment centers primarily to cut shipping costs and speed up delivery. Amazon already has a huge presence in Michigan. Since 2016, the online retailer has announced three facilities in this region and a corporate office in Detroit. The addition of the new center in Michigan will bring the total workforce count to more than 3,500.In 2016, Amazon’s capital expenditure increased 51% on a year-over-year basis. A major part of it was utilized in the construction of 26 fulfillment centers and deployment of robotics technology inside them.Bottom LineFulfillment centers help Amazon in storage and shipping of products, besides handling returns quickly. In fact, these are important for providing the level of services that customers expect from the company.Additionally, small retailers that are unable to provide relatively cost-efficient shipping are signing up for Amazon’s fulfillment services. Third parties also avail the company’s warehouses and shipping services. These, in turn, help the company boost revenues and drive expansion in the long haul.However, heavy investments in these arrangements (and several other initiatives) are keeping Amazon’s margins under pressure, thereby negatively impacting its bottom line. Also, Amazon’s retail business is currently facing stiff competition from Alibaba (BABA  -  Free Report) and eBay (EBAY  -  Free Report), among others.Amazon.com, Inc.

3205,EBAY,"Earnings season kicked off last week with the first few technology companies averaging a 9.9% earnings growth rate on a revenues growth rate of 7.1%. The biggest releases were Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report), Lam Research (LRCX  -  Free Report), eBAY (EBAY  -  Free Report), PayPal (PYPL  -  Free Report) and IBM (IBM  -  Free Report). Here are the details:EarningsNetflix: The video streaming company had a very good revenue quarter, with the top line jumping over 30% from last year. Subscriber additions were impressive with domestic paid members growing 10.5% to 51.35 million. International growth was even stronger at up 43.2% to 52.68 million. But since content costs whether acquired or produced continue to increase, the earnings of 29 cents fell below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 32 cents.The recent price hike will help future results but note that the company has already also earmarked several billions for content. Moreover, it continues to burn cash. Read more: Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) Q3 Earnings Miss, Subscriber Growth ImpressiveLam Research: Semiconductor equipment maker Lam Research saw very strong growth in revenue and earnings, both of which also sailed past the respective Zacks Consensus Estimates. That’s because the semiconductor market is particularly hot right now, as players scramble to produce more memory to capture the growing demand for data and related services.The company estimates that the semiconductor market will grow 15%+ this year following a 2% average growth rate in the last six years. At the same time, it says that WFE spending has remained rational, implying that there’s unlikely to be a correction any time soon. In this environment, Lam’s early lead in acquiring the capabilities to serve the NAND market will help it gain market share. Read more: Lam Research (LRCX  -  Free Report) Tops Q1 Earnings & Revenue EstimateseBay: The online marketplace reported earnings that matched the Zacks Consensus Estimate (helped by share buybacks) on revenue that exceeded slightly (helped by positive FX). Active buyers increased by a couple of million, the marketplaces business also did well, but promotional pricing for new/small sellers and sluggish growth in StubHub impacted results. StubHub issues are likely to continue, as sporting events restricting tickets is making it harder for the business to generate profits.The guidance for the all-important holiday quarter was also short of exciting: revenue of $2.58 billion to $2.62 billion (or 9% growth at the midpoint) compared to $2.58 billion consensus and EPS of $0.57 to $0.59 (or 7% growth at the midpoint) compared to $0.60 consensus. Read more: eBay (EBAY  -  Free Report) Q3 Earnings Match Estimates, Revenues BeatPayPal: PayPal also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimates on both revenue and profits and raised full-year guidance. Apart from registering strong growth in revenue and earnings, the company also reported an increase of 88% in its active customer base to 218 million, including more than 17 million merchant accounts. The total payment volume (TPV) jumped 30% with 35% of the payment volume coming from mobile devices. The P2P business (Venmo) saw a 106% increase in TPV.

Hargreaves raised his fiscal 2018 earnings estimate from $11.07 to $11.68, well above the street consensus of $11.03 while upgrading the stock from Sector Weight to Overweight.The analyst said that Apple’s layered pricing strategy of $999 for the iPhone X, higher prices for the iPhone 8/8 Plus as well as its storage step-up pricing was effectively segmenting its customer base to generate more profit for the company. As a result, his iPhone ASP and gross margin targets are now up to $760 and 39.5%, respectively (the street consensus is at $725 and 38.6%). Prompted by an improved outlook for average selling prices, Lamba raised his price target from $150 to $160, which is close to Apple’s current price and retained his neutral rating on the shares.Alphabet’s Sidewalk Labs Unleashed on Toronto: Alphabet’s Sidewalk Labs is partnering with Waterfront Toronto, the public agency funded by federal, provincial and city governments, to build a highly digitized neighborhood in the Eastern Waterfront area of the Canadian capital. Quayside, as the area will be called, is currently an underdeveloped region, but the plan is to take it to the forefront of technological progress, teaming with automated transport of various kinds, including bikes, vans and cars for both personal and business uses, and even an automated trash collection system.Waymo and Lyft are expected to help in these efforts and other companies are likely to join the efforts as and when Sidewalk Labs partners with them. Google will be moving its Canadian headquarters and around 300 employees to the site once it is completed. But it expects to employ around 5,000 people in the region by then and support another 5,000 over the following 3-4 years.Amazon Wind Farm: Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) has launched the 253 megawatt Amazon Wind Farm Texas, which operates more than 100 turbines – each over 300 feet tall with a rotor diameter more than twice the wingspan of a Boeing 787. Amazon Wind Farm Texas is built, owned and operated by Lincoln Clean Energy, a leading developer of wind and solar projects across the U.S. Amazon has launched 18 wind and solar projects across the U.S., with over 35 more to come. It is second only to Google in its clean energy consumption, having bought more than 1.22 gigawatts to date. Google has bought 1.85 gigawatts.Amazon Expands in Brazil: Amazon has been selling books in Brazil since 2012 but the company has now started selling electronics as well. Products can also be purchased with up to ten interest free monthly installments on the items sold with local sellers handling deliveries. The logistics business in Brazil is reportedly complicated, which makes it difficult for ecommerce companies to get into it.Amazon may eventually open a fulfillment center for sellers, although that is pure conjecture at this point. A Bloomberg report mentioned that Amazon’s easy returns policy might help it gain momentum, as that is a sore point for Brazilian customers and it’s apparently really hard to get your money back.NVIDIA Price Target Hiked: Analyst Vijay Rakesh reiterated his buy rating on (NVDA  -  Free Report), while raising his price target to $220, representing around 12% upside from current levels. Some of the positives cited include the rising GPU pricing trend fueled by strength in the gaming and cryptocurrency markets, recent business deal wins in China and growing demand from the self-driving market.HP Estimates, Target Price Up: Amit Daryanani of RBC raised estimates to account for the company’s 2018 guidance. His new EPS estimate is $1.81 (previously $1.74) and revenue estimate $52.0 billion (previously $50.8 billion). The note said that HPQ's ""FY18 guide is inherently conservative and could enable sustained beats/raises over the next few quarters,"" and ""Commodity markets should remain challenging but likely peak in FQ4 (October); that headwind should be offset by cost-reduction initiatives.""Micron Retires Debt, Appoints EVP Global Operations: Micron will be using the proceeds of its recent equity offering to redeem $1.25 billion of its outstanding 7.5% notes due 2023 and $1 billion of its 5.25% notes due 2023. The company also appointed Manish Bhatia as EVP of Global Operations to report directly to Sanjay Mehrotra, president and CEO. He will be in charge of operations, including the company’s global manufacturing fab footprint, back-end assembly and test operations, supply chain planning and fulfillment, procurement, quality and IT teams to enhance Micron’s agility and responsiveness to meet customer requirements through a tighter coordination and alignment of these critical business functions.Legal/RegulatoryApple Fined $440 Million: After 7 years of winning and losing appeals, VirnetX, which sues on patents held but doesn’t manufacture anything of its own, has finally won another legal round against Apple. The judge and jury found Apple guilty of infringement and willful infringement at that, so they awarded the patent troll, as such companies are sometimes called, $440 million. This includes the jury verdict of $302.4 million awarded last year, additional willful infringement charges of $41.3 million or $1.80 in royalties per infringed device sold, and another $96 million by way of interests, costs and attorney fees. Apple said it would appeal the decision.Qualcomm Sues Apple Again:  An Accesswire report indicates that Qualcomm has filed another patent infringement case against Apple in Beijing. The three patents in question are related to power management and touch screen technology known as Force Touch, which Apple uses in its iPhones. Qualcomm says that since these patents are not a part of any standard, it is not bound to license them.Qualcomm is asking the court to ban the manufacture and sale of iPhones in China. Since this is an employment question, it is very unlikely that the lawsuit will be successful. The Chinese authorities haven’t made the filing public yet. Apple hasn’t denied infringement, but instead called the suit a courtroom maneuver, adding that these patents have never been discussed in the past and that Qualcomm’s effort would fail.New Products/TechnologyApple Watch Connectivity Issue in China: The new Apple Watch was the first one offering cellular connectivity by virtue of an eSIM (subscriber identity module) that Apple has embedded in it. The problem is that in China, the SIM is normally provided by state-owned telecom companies, which also register the person’s name. This therefore made it possible for the government to identify the person using it.Connectivity was first made available exclusively to customers on China Unicom, but was abruptly cut off without adequate explanations. All that China Unicom said on its website was that the cellular feature had been offered on a trial basis. It’s currently believed that since the technology is relatively new and lesser-known in China, regulatory authorities may have required its discontinuation.iPhone 8 Demand Issue: Taiwan’s Economic Daily reported that Apple told its suppliers of a 50% cut in iPhone 8 components for the final quarter of the year because of lower-than-expected demand. This is likely because of customers are waiting it out to buy the more expensive iPhone X, although there could be some customers defecting to other devices. If iPhone X increases in the sales mix, Apple will obviously make more profit, so this weakness could in fact be good news. Nevertheless, it sent shares down.Intel on Autonomous Vehicle Safety: Intel and Mobileye have created a set of standards that if adopted will ensure that self-driving cars aren’t responsible for accidents. At the World Knowledge Forum in Seoul, South Korea, Professor Amnon Shashua, Mobileye CEO and Intel senior vice president, offered his solution.The solution is based on the understanding that the most a vehicle can do to avoid an accident is to ensure that it isn’t the cause. The company seeks to show that computers can precisely calculate the time it takes for another vehicle or pedestrian approaching it to actually make contact with it, so it can take a course of action that will avoid the collision much better than a human.Cisco’s AI-Powered Predictive Services: The two new services are called Business Critical Services and High-value Services. Powered by AI, these services anticipate IT failures, mitigate risk, reduce maintenance costs, and assist organizations in attaining the necessary skills to transform their businesses. ""Business Critical Services,"" uses analytics, automation, compliance and security tools to enable a secure, efficient and agile technology environment, minimize human error and help extract the most value from products and solutions in a secure environment. High-value services offer software, hardware and network support for Cisco systems and processes.YouTube Comedy Video Series: Featuring comedians Trevor Noah, Judd Apatow and Howie Mandel, YouTube has launched its first virtual reality (VR) video series called “The Confessional”. Google offered a grant to Montreal-based production company Felix & Paul Studios as funding. In seven episodes of several minutes each, over the next few weeks, comedians and YouTube stars including Lilly Singh and Grace Helbig will confess about embarrassing and awkward moments in their lives such as first dates gone wrong.YouTube hasn’t said how much it intends to spend on VR content, but it should be a priority for its recently-launched $79 Daydream View headset, which uses the smartphone display close to stream VR content. Earlier this year, it pulled out $30K to launch a training program for video makers with at least 10,000 followers. It also introduced a new video format for semi-immersive videos that is intended to reduce the cost of creation.Google Chip for Consumer Devices: Last week, Google announced a system on chip (SoC) called Pixel Visual Core that will increase the speed and power efficiency of its camera. Google says it’s an image processing unit (IPU), although it is structurally closer to an 8-core processor like Qualcomm’s Snapdragon or Samsung Exynos. Although a part of its latest Pixel offerings, Google will activate the device some time soon, after which third-party developers will get access to it.Google hasn’t said that its relationship with Qualcomm will change as a result of the chip, but its growing prowess in chip design is no doubt a matter of concern for the leading mobile processor company. For Google, this is an important step to more closely integrate hardware and software in its devices the way that Apple does. If anything, these moves are indication of Google’s growing ambitions for mobile and IoT markets. New Twitter Rules for Abuse, Hate Speech: Twitter hasn’t formed any new rules, but the company has come out and said that it’s going to. Its primary goal is to remove unwanted sexual advances, nonconsensual nudity, hate symbols, violent groups, and tweets that glorify violence from the platform and it will frame rules so bystanders can report incidents.Twitter ""will take enforcement action against organizations that use/have historically used violence as a means to advance their cause."" The concession comes after Rose McGowan was prevented from posting additional tweets about alleged sexual abuse by Hollywood bigwigs. Twitter said that the 12-hour suspension was because she mentioned a private phone number. Women boycotted the site on her call. This kind of thing is turning out to be unsafe for users and therefore, harmful for business, so the company says it is taking necessary steps.Collaborations and M&AApple-GE Deal: Apple has inked a deal with GE to use its Predix data-collection and analysis tool to launch a toolkit targeted at the industrial sector. The toolkit will help developers build apps for iPhone and iPads that can facilitate collaboration in industrial environments thus increasing the efficiency of operations, lowering unplanned downtime, facilitating better resource allocation and leading to overall time and cost savings.Apple’s role will thus be to develop and promote Predix as the industrial IoT platform of choice, for which GE will standardize on iPhone and iPad and promote Apple's Mac computers as a choice for its global workforce of more than 330,000 employees. Apple’s approach has been to build custom solutions for large enterprises and verticals, with each win being a stepping stone, helping it expand deeper into the enterprise segment.Intel-Facebook on AI Chip: Intel announced its Nervana Neural Network Processors at the WSJ D.Live conference last week. The chip has been built specifically for neural networks and is, according to Intel a first of its kind. Intel intends to expand the product line to an entire family over time.Former Nervana CEO Naveen Rao who joined Intel after his company was acquired by the chip giant, said that Intel would ultimately sell the chips in two ways: it will either sell a data center appliance containing several of the new Nervana Neural Network Processors as well as Intel’s CPUs to customers wanting to run deep learning projects within their own data centers. Or, it will rent access to the chips through Intel’s cloud data centers the way NVIDIA does. Facebook, which along with others helped the chip get off to launch, will be among the first to test the chip on its platform.   Facebook Buys tbh: Facebook has bought tbh, or “to be honest,” the anonymous messaging app from parent company Midnight Labs. The app allows you to run polls regarding people’s positive attributes, after which there is an option to connect with the people that chose you. They can, however, choose to remain anonymous even after they are part of your network. The app has been very popular with teens this summer rising to the top of Apple’s app store rankings despite launching only in August. Apple’s app store describes the app as one that has been downloaded 5 million times with 2.5 million daily active users.Facebook’s Deal with Delivery Services: Facebook now has deals with food delivery services like GrubHub, EatStreet, Delivery.com, DoorDash, ChowNow and Olo and direct deals with some restaurants that will allow U.S. users to order food from within the app. Facebook says food delivery is a tricky business and promises to remove some of the hurdles in its operation.The goal is, of course, that users never leave its platform by giving them all they might need right on it. The longer they stay, the greater the opportunities to serve them ads and keep them from rival services like Google. In the delivery business too, operations like UberEats and Amazon delivery are likely to see increased competition because of Facebook.Cisco Buying Perspica: Cisco is building on its $3.7 billion acquisition of AppDynamics, which offers tools to better understand how applications are operating to identify which applications or hardware are not providing optimal performance. Now, Perspica, a machine learning startup that has raised around $8.85 million, will expand and strengthen these capabilities so customers can better analyze large amounts of application-related data, in real time and with business context, and irrespective of when an application is deployed in a company's public, private or multiple cloud environments.  Google-Target Deal Expansion: Just as Walmart did a short while back, Target is cozying up with Google to help it battle Amazon in ecommerce. After testing the Google Express delivery service in New York City, the company has announced that it will be expanding it to the rest of the country barring Hawaii and Alaska. So customers can use the Google Express website or app to get their Target stuff delivered.What’s more, Target is quickly bringing more services to Google Express, including its Redcard credit and debit cards that enable free shipping and a 5% discount (this one should be available next year). Although voice ordering hasn’t gained momentum and most people aren’t comfortable using it yet, the deal also lets Target customers voice-order through Google Home.For Google, this is valuable data that gives it insight into customer buying habits and so, can help it better target ads. It also provides it a foothold in the product search space that Amazon has grown quickly to dominate.Some NumbersNintendo Switch: Top-Selling Console in September: Nintendo has come out to say that according to NPD sales data, the company’s Switch game console was the leading one in September, making it the best-selling device in the U.S. for three straight months and five of the last seven months. When combined with the 3DS family of systems and the Super NES Classic Edition system, Nintendo systems claimed two-thirds of the month’s total video game hardware sales.With the first holiday season in progress, the company will no doubt see a very strong year. Nintendo’s return to prominence is commendable despite the fact that both Sony’s PS4 and Microsoft’s XB1 have been around for a few years.Some Companies Reporting This Week: TXN, TER, NLSN, KLAC, EXPE, GOOGL, FTV, AMZN, FFIV, CA, XLNX, NXPI, IRM, TWTR, VRSN, NTGR, GRUB, STX, AMD, AKAM, GLW, JNPR, MSFT, CDNS, INTC, WDCZacks' Hidden TradesWhile we share many recommendations and ideas with the public, certain moves are hidden from everyone but selected members of our portfolio services.

3206,EBAY,"It’s been more than two years sincethe digital payment company PayPal (PYPL  -  Free Report) formally cut ties with eBay Inc. (EBAY  -  Free Report). So, we can now easily evaluate how successful the spin-off decision was and throw light on their recent earnings performances (read: Spin-Off ETF: Can the Outperformance Continue?).PayPal is now valued at $84.39 billion, more than 80% higher than what it was on its first trading day. On the other hand, its erstwhile parent company eBay’s market cap has grown to $38.38 billion from $34.63 billion in July 2015 (read: ETFs to Ride on PayPal Growth Story).A Peek into the Latest Earnings Picture: PYPL Wins, eBAy LoseseBay Inc. reported decent third-quarter 2017 results (after the closing bell on Oct 18) with earnings matching the Zacks Consensus Estimate and revenues beating the same by a slight margin. Pro forma earnings of 48 cents improved 6.7% year over year. Gross revenues of $2.41 billion were up 8.7% on a year-over-year basis (up 8% on an Fx-neutral basis) and came ahead of the guided range.Shares had fallen 5.9% in after-hours trading reacting to the company’s weaker-than-expected fourth quarter as well as annual earnings outlook. Year to date, the stock has underperformed its industry, gaining only 22.7% compared with the industry’s gain of 48%.PayPal Holdings Inc. reported better-than-expected third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 19, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both counts. Pro forma earnings of 46 cents per share beat the consensus mark by 2 cents, increasing 31.4% year over year but staying flat sequentially.Net revenues of $3.24 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by $66 million and were up 21.4% on a year-over-year basis (up 22% on an Fx-neutral basis) and 3.3% sequentially.

PayPal shares have rallied 74.2% year to date, massively outperforming its industry’s gain of 14.6%.Technical Stock Scores While both stocks have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), Sector and Industry scores are different. PayPal’s Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 33% while its Sector Rank is in the top 25%.

International Business Machines Corp. (IBM  -  Free Report) was the biggest gainer among the Dow components, while its shares registered the biggest one-day percentage gain since 2009 driven by better-than-expected earnings results.Financial stocks continued to move north, especially, after Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) successfully navigated a difficult trading environment in the third quarter. An impressive investment banking performance helped both the financial behemoths improve their bottom-line numbers. Needless to say, that their earnings and revenues both had already topped Wall Street expectations on Tuesday morning.Stock Market – Movers & Shakers!The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) closed at 23,157.60, gaining 0.7%.

Big Blue’s cloud revenues, however, soared 20% in the quarter to hit $4.1 billion.IBM CFO Martin Schroeter said in an interview said that “we said we’d have a better second half than first, and we did a bit better on the revenue line”.

3209,EBAY,"eBay Inc. (EBAY  -  Free Report) will report  second-quarter 2017 earnings on Jul 20 after the bell.The company has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, a combination that makes surprise prediction difficult. This is because, per our proven model, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 to beat estimates. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.eBay Inc. Price and EPS Surprise eBay Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | eBay Inc. QuoteWe don’t recommend Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or #5) going into the earnings announcement.eBay’s surprise history has been decent as the company beat estimates in two of the last four quarters and matched estimates on one occasion.Over the last one year, however, the stock has underperformed the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry. It gained roughly 40% compared with the industry’s gain of 51.5%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcementRecap of the First Quarter PerformanceeBay’s first-quarter earnings and revenues came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Revenues were up 3.7% year over year.Revenue growth was driven by strength in international markets, growth of active buyers, integration of the Ticketbis acquisition, expansion of new user experience and brand advertising. eBay added 2 million active buyers in the first quarter taking the total to 169 million.What We Are Watching?eBay is currently replatforming itself and sees significant progress on this front. The company accelerated its efforts by building product catalogs on structured data, enhancing mobile platform, rolling out new browse inspired shopping journeys, rejuvenating customer-to-customer (C2C) business and strengthening its brand.Apart from structured data and enhancing mobile experience, application of artificial intelligence, increased use of social media to drive traffic, category merchandising, and an easier listing process are  positives. The company’s recent deal with Flipkart is expected to increase penetration in India.However, concerns remain in the form of increasing competition in the e-commerce and hardline retail market from companies like Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Wal-Mart and deceleration of growth in the e-commerce market both domestically and internationally.eBay’s increased investment toward overall platform technology and slower growth rate compared to its peers are also overhangs. Furthermore, eBay’s growth continues to suffer due to a weak world economy. The company is heavily dependent on countries outside the U.S for its transaction and Internet sales. Although the U.S. is flourishing, emerging economies are slowing down.Summing UpeBay’s unique capabilities backed by technological improvements give it an edge over its competitors. We remain positive about eBay’s replatforming and brand enhancement initiatives, the pace of building a solid foundation of structured data and artificial intelligence, increasing personalizing capacities and improving mobile experience. However expected results may take some time to show up due to weak global economy, slow e-commerce growth and increasing competition.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a couple of stocks that you may want to consider as our model shows these have the right combination of elements to post a positive earnings surprise:Cypress Semiconductor Corporation (CY  -  Free Report), with an Earnings ESP of +11.11% and Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Lam Research Corporation (LRCX  -  Free Report), with an Earnings ESP of +1.33% and a Zacks Rank #1.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

The company’s focus on improving buyers’ experience, opportunities in the fast-growing mobile space, international expansion and a strong balance sheet are likely to boost long-term growth.Notably, eBay is making a lot of efforts to expand its international footprint. Only recently, eBay expanded its partnership with MallforAfrica to further strengthen its cross border business. Created in 2011, MallforAfrica is a platform to help connect businesses with consumers in Africa.The deal will help eBay to increase its presence in Africa and open new revenue opportunities.  According to consulting firm McKinsey, digital sales revenue in Africa will top $75 billion by 2025. Given such impressive projected numbers in Africa, eBay is sure to gain from it.Also, eBay has been making continuous efforts to fuel growth in its Marketplaces business. It has re-platformed itself by building product catalogs on structured data, enhancing mobile platform, rolling out new browse inspired shopping journeys and strengthening its brand.Last month, eBay Inc. entered into a partnership with Facebook to offer daily deals on Facebook’s Mobile Marketplace. The deal will boost eBay’s Marketplace by offering its platform features to Facebook and getting access to the latter’s huge user base in return.Also, eBay struck a deal with Shopify in July. The two launched a new sales channel, an integrated platform that allows Shopify sellers to synchronize inventory information, sell products ordered on eBay and view eBay buyer messages directly from Shopify accounts.These moves will help accelerate eBay's growth.

3212,EBAY,"Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) has announced its plans to open its first fulfillment center in Staten Island, NY. This new facility will be equipped with modern technology.Also, it is likely to deploy robots which will decrease the time taken to sort and pack products, thus strengthening its same-day or overnight delivery services.Notably, Amazon has underperformed the industry on a year-to-date basis. Shares of the company have gained 29.1% compared with the industry’s growth of 47.0% in the same time period.About the New FacilityThe 855,000-square-foot fulfillment center is being developed by Matrix Development Group. It will feature innovative technology like deploying robots to speed up its deliveries. Going forward, the center is expected to create more than 2,250 new full-time jobs.Meanwhile, Amazon has been increasingly investing to build and modernize fulfillment centers mainly to cut shipping costs and speed up delivery. The company also plans to open more centers in Sacramento, CA; Kansas City, KS; North Randall, OH and other cities, which will add to more than 80 such centers worldwide.In 2016, Amazon’s capital expenditure increased 51% on a year-over-year basis. A major part of it was used in the construction of 26 fulfillment centers and deployment of robotics technology inside them.A Prudent Capital InvestmentFulfillment centers help Amazon in storage and shipping of products, besides handling returns quickly. In fact, these are important for providing the level of services that customers expect from the company.In addition, small retailers that are unable to provide relatively cost-efficient shipping are signing up for Amazon’s fulfillment services. Third parties also avail the company’s warehouses and shipping services. These, in turn, help the company boost revenues and drive expansion in the long haul.Although heavy investments in these arrangements (and several other initiatives) keep Amazon’s margins under pressure, they are also responsible for the company’s progress. Evidently, Amazon’s retail business is currently unbeatable on price, choice and convenience in the face of fierce competition from Alibaba (BABA  -  Free Report) and eBay (EBAY  -  Free Report), among others.Furthermore, we believe that Amazon’s long history of execution, growing focus on innovation, technological prowess and huge cash balance not only give it the flexibility to pursue growth in potential areas but also create value for investors.Amazon.com, Inc.

3214,EBAY,"As investors continue to digest the latest quarterly report from Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report), the floodgates have opened on the Q3 earnings season, and several more of our favorite consumer tech brands will release their new financial results soon.One of this week’s other marquee tech earnings reports will be that of PayPal (PYPL  -  Free Report). Founded by a team of entrepreneurs that included Elon Musk and Peter Thiel, PayPal is a digital payments company that has revolutionized online transactions. And since spinning off from eBay (EBAY  -  Free Report) in mid-2015, PayPal has been on fire.A rise in demand for mobile payment solutions has led to PayPal shares gaining nearly 74% in 2017 alone. This momentum has helped PayPal become one of the tech sector’s hottest stocks of the year, which means all eyes will be on the company when it releases its latest quarterly report on Thursday.Heading into its report date, PayPal rests just $2 per share below its all-time high. That fact adds even more pressure for the stock, as investors will want to see big results before sending shares any higher. So should you buy PYPL ahead of earnings? Let’s take a closer look!Earnings & Revenue OutlookAccording to our latest consensus estimates, PayPal is projected to post earnings of 44 cents per share and revenues of $3.17 billion. These results would represent year-over-year growth rates of 25% and 19%, respectively.Investors will also be interested to see whether or not PayPal can exceed these earnings expectations. It’s worth noting that PayPal has met or surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each quarter since its spin-off, but we should also take a look at the stock’s Earnings ESP.Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better ranking helps us feel confident about an earnings beat. PayPal is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), but with an Earnings ESP of -0.14%, our predictive power is limited. Still, the company has a solid track record for surprises and has beaten consensus estimates by an average of 4.21% over the past four quarters.Key Segment DetailsIf PayPal wants to blow investors away, it will need to post impressive results in several of its key segments. Luckily, we can use the Zacks exclusive non-financial metrics file to get a feel for how the company might do. These estimates are updated daily and are based on the independent research of expert stock analysts. Learn more here>>>According to our latest consensus estimates, PayPal is slated to report that it reached 216 million active customer accounts in the quarter. This would mark a 12.5% year-over-year improvement and a 2.9% gain from the previous quarter. It’s also important to note that PayPal recorded 11.7% year-over-year growth in this category in Q2, so if our estimates hold up, it would mean that the company’s customer growth has picked up.Furthermore, our consensus estimates indicate that total payment volume reached $109.03 billion in the quarter. This would represent year-over-year growth of 24.7%, which outpaces the 23.5% growth witnessed during Q2.Investors will also want to keep an eye on any information related to Venmo, the PayPal-owned peer-to-peer payment system that is a hit with millennials. While Venmo is likely not a major money-maker for the company yet, it has exploded in popularity over the past few years and should help solidify PayPal as the mobile transactions company of today.Bottom LineWith a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and a red-hot stock, PayPal is looking strong headed into its report date. The company is witnessing strong growth in several of its key segments, and that growth is translating into overall expansion on the top and bottom lines.Nevertheless, shares are near an all-time high, which means the report will have to be exceptional if the stock wants to break into a new range.Want more stock market analysis from this author?

3215,EBAY,"Spin-off activities have stepped up lately, with biggies like Honeywell International (HON  -  Free Report) and Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) being the most active ones. Lately, the industrial giant Honeywell announced plans of spinning off its homes and global distribution units and its transportation systems unit into two publicly traded companies by 2018 end (read: 5 ETFs to Buy on 13-Year High Manufacturing Activity).On the other hand, Pfizer is exploring strategic alternatives to possibly bid good-bye to its Consumer Healthcare segment. A sale or spin-off of its consumer-health unit is expected next year. Pfizer's consumer sales have been essentially “flat for the past three years.”This clearly explains why Pfizer intends to concentrate on the more promising, innovative pharmaceutical unit and separate it from Consumer Healthcare. The move also signifies the likely introduction of more deal-making, as per Wall Street Journal. However, the company also kept open chances of retaining the business.Inside Spin-offsSometimes businesses form another autonomous entity from an existing business/division, when they believe that the separated line would add more value as an independent company. In such situations, the parent can focus on its core business management while the new entity can focus on its relative different goals.How Profitable Spin-offs are to Investors?According to Cantor Fitzgerald, “spinoffs completed between 2009 and 2013 outperformed the S&P 500 in their first year of trading by an average of more than 17 percent.” As per an article published on benzinga, spun-off entities have been performing better than parent companies lately.PayPal (PYPL  -  Free Report) (up about 114%) generated higher gains than parent eBay (EBAY  -  Free Report) (up about 56%) in the last two years (post spin-off). WhiteWave Foods Co  gained about 67.8% in the last three years against an 11.2% decline in Dean Foods Co (DF  -  Free Report). WhiteWave Foods was spun off in May 2013. Abbot Laboratories (ABT  -  Free Report) cut ties with part of its business and formed a new company called AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) in Jan 2013. ABBV was up 85% while ABT gained 41% in the last three years (as of Oct 12, 2017).What’s Behind the Recent Surge in Spin-OffA Chicago-based partner at The Boston Consulting Group recently commented that in a bull market, which we are witnessing currently, equities are overvalued. This makes materialization of mergers and acquisitions difficult. Instead, high valuations better justify “spinning off assets or divesting assets."" If this logic holds good, we are likely to see more such actions in the coming days (read: 4 Bargain ETFs in a Pricey Market).Notably, the United States saw 88 completed spinoffs in 1999, which fell to 80 in 2000, when the dot-com bubble burst. The number further declined to 55 in 2001. The number of actions again rose from 24 in 2007 to 30 in 2008, before sliding to 17 in 2009 when the financial crisis kicked in, as per the data provided by Dealogic, quoted on CNBC. The momentum again gained momentum in 2015 by value, though 2016 and 2017 have been subdued.ETFs to Play There are always ways to play such corporate actions. Below we highlight two spin-off ETFs in detail. These ETFs can get further boost from Honeywell and Pfizer’s announcements.Guggenheim S&P Spin-Off ETF (CSD  -  Free Report)The 61-stock fund looks to track the S&P U.S. Spin-Off Index. Paypal Holdings (7.98%), Hewlett Packard Enterprise (7.85%) and Synchrony Financial (7.39%) are the top three holdings of the fund. CSD charges 65 bps in fees (read: PayPal's Strong Q2 Results Put These ETFs in Focus).VanEck Vectors Global Spin-Off ETF (SPUN  -  Free Report) The 95-stock fund follows the Horizon Kinetics Global Spin-Off Index, which is a rules-based, equal-weighted index intended to track the performance of listed, publicly held spin-offs that are domiciled and trade in the U.S. or developed markets of Western Europe and Asia. The net expense ratio of the fund is 0.55%. United States accounts for about 78.8% of the fund. Gannett Co (1.2%), Time Inc. (1.1%) and Timkensteel (1.1%) are top three stocks of the fund.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

3216,EBAY,"PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL  -  Free Report) is acquiring online small business lending firm Swift Financial for an undisclosed amount. The acquisition, subject to regulatory approval, is expected to be completed later this year.Founded in 2006, Delaware-based Swift Financial provides loans, cash advances and lines of credit to small businesses in the U.S. The company claims that it has funded more than 20,000 businesses since inception. Both the companies have already been in a commercial partnership, so integration risk is likely to be low.PayPal Looks to Boost its Lending BusinessPayPal has been working on providing a wide gamut of financial services to lure small businesses to its platform and lock existing ones. This is part of its intensified focus on the growing number of active customer accounts since it was spun off from eBay (EBAY  -  Free Report).We believe that by acquiring Swift Financial, PayPal will be able to make its financing solutions more accessible and affordable to small businesses, leveraging on the additional underwriting data and capabilities that Swift offers.This in turn will help the company grow its PayPal Working Capital unit that has been offering short-term loans to smaller merchants since 2013. The unit provided more than $3 billion worth of funds to 115,000 small businesses at up to $125,000 each. PayPal stated that the acquisition will enable it to increase term loans to $500,000 for its larger merchants and also offer sufficient credit to those business who are yet not using its services.In addition, PayPal will be in a position to give tough competition to companies like Square (SQ  -  Free Report), Kabbage and Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) in the small business lending space. Square has already passed 1 billion in loans through its Square Capital program. Amazon claims that it has loaned $3 billion to small and medium-sized businesses.Our TakeWe expect the acquisition to significantly boost PayPal’s other value added services revenues that include interest and fees earned on PayPal Credit loans, gateway fees, subscription fees and gain on sale of participation interest in consumer loans receivable and more.Moreover, since PayPal earns from transactions between merchants and customers, the company, through this acquisition, could boost its transaction revenues by enabling merchants to grow their businesses and enhance sales.In the recently reported quarter, transaction revenues of $2.75 billion contributed 88% to total revenue and were up 6% sequentially and 18% on a year-over-year basis. Other value added services revenues contributed the rest and increased 3% sequentially and 18% year over year. The company added 6.5 million new customers in the first quarter, taking the total active customer accounts to 210 million.It also increased its full year guidance.  The company now expects revenues between $12.78 billion and $12.88 billion compared with its earlier expectations of $12.52–$12.72 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 12.70 billion.

3217,EBAY,"eBay Inc. (EBAY  -  Free Report) reported decent third-quarter 2017 results with earnings matching the Zacks Consensus Estimate and revenues beating the same by a slight margin. Pro forma earnings of 48 cents improved 6.7% year over year.Gross revenues of $2.41 billion were up 8.7% on a year-over-year basis (up 8% on an Fx-neutral basis) and came ahead of the guided range.Both top and bottom line growth was driven by strength across all three platforms – Marketplace, Classifieds and StubHub in the United States and internationally.Shares, however, fell 5.9% in after-hours trading in response to the company’s weaker-than-expected fourth-quarter as well as annual earnings outlook.At the call, management appeared impressed with the progress of the company transforming itself and the positive response of customers. eBay is leveraging on its structured data and Artificial Intelligence (AI) strength to build product catalogs, enhance mobile platform, roll out new browse inspired shopping journeys, enhance customer-to-customer (C2C) business and strengthen its brand.It accelerated its AI efforts through structured data, personalization, image search technology and customer support effort in several areas.In the third quarter, eBay rolled out group listings, a new way of searching that enables users to organize search results by products rather than listing. It partnered with Spring to offer a wide range of apparel and accessories through ebay.com. It has also extended its price matching program to international markets. eBay will soon launch Guaranteed Delivery program on 20 million items that arrive in three business days or less.Overall, we remain positive on eBay’s replatforming and brand enhancement initiatives. Its unique capabilities backed by technological improvements give it an edge over competitors such as Etsy (ETSY  -  Free Report), Alibaba (BABA  -  Free Report) and Facebook (FB  -  Free Report).However, expected results may take some time to show up due to weak global economy, slow e-commerce growth and increasing competition. Year to date, the stock has underperformed its industry, gaining only 27.9% compared with the industry’s gain of 52.7%.Let’s delve deeper into the numbersRevenues and GMVIn the third quarter, the Marketplace platform contributed $20.5 billion of gross merchandise volume (GMV) and $1.9 billion of revenues. Marketplace GMV grew 9% year over year on a reported basis and 7% on an FX-Neutral basis. StubHub made a contribution of $1.2 billion of GMV, up 2% on a year-over-year basis, and revenues of $275 million, up 5% year over year.eBay Inc. Revenue (TTM) eBay Inc. Revenue (TTM) | eBay Inc.

GMV growth was fastest since 2014. Active buyers/customers increased 5% from the year-ago quarter to 168 million. This figure excludes domestic active buyers in India that eBay is no longer reporting after the sale of its India business to Flipkart.Margins and IncomePro-forma gross margin for the quarter was 77.2%, down 64 basis points (bps) year over year but up 101 bps sequentially. Cost of revenues increased 11.6% on a year-over-year basis primarily due to first-party inventory program in Korea.Adjusted operating expenses of $1.1 billion decreased 1.9% from the prior-year quarter and 10.7% sequentially. Pro-forma operating margin was 29.6%, down 30 bps year over year but up 230 bps sequentially.GAAP net income was $523 million (48 cents per share) compared with $418 million (36 cents per share) in the year-ago quarter.Balance Sheet and Cash FloweBay’s balance sheet is highly leveraged, with total debt of $10 billion eclipsing cash and short-term investments balance of $6 billion. The company generated $877 million in cash from operating activities and spent $157 million on capex. Share repurchases were $907 million in the quarter.OutlookFor the fourth quarter of 2017, eBay expects revenues to grow 6%–8% on an Fx-neutral basis to $2.58 billion – $2.62 billion, better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.57 billion.

We expect the stock momentum to continue in the rest of 2017 based on the aforesaid factors.Quarter DetailsSubscription Solutions revenues grew 63.9% to $71.6 million. This increase was driven by the continued rapid growth in Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR).As of Jun 30, 2017, MRR was $23.7 million, up 64% from $14.4 million as of Jun 30, 2016. Shopify Plus accounted for 4.3 million or 18% of this MRR compared with 13% of MRR in the year-ago quarter.Merchant Solutions revenues grew 86% to $80.1 million, backed primarily by the growth of Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV), which soared 74% from the year-ago quarter to $5.8 billion.

3219,EBAY,"After another stellar regular trading day this Wednesday, which saw new record closing highs for the Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500, Q3 earnings results from several companies across a wide spectrum of industries hit the tape after the bell. United Air Lines (UAL  -  Free Report), American Express (AXP  -  Free Report) and eBay (EBAY  -  Free Report) have all put out Q3 results this afternoon.American Express shares are down upon the credit card major's latest quarterly beat: earnings per share of $1.50 topped the Zacks consensus estimate by 3 cents, representing 20% growth year over year. Revenues also bested expectations, bringing in $8.44 billion in the quarter, above the $8.32 billion anticipated. The company also raised full-year earnings guidance to $5.80 - 5.90. Yet shares dipped roughly 1% in the immediate aftermath of the quarterly release.This likely has to do with the surprise announcement that AmEx's Ken Chenault will be retiring, stepping down as Chairman and CEO as of February 1st next year. Current Vice Chair Steven Squeri will assume both roles for AmEx. Also, company shares are up 24% year-to-date and 53% year over year.United also surpassed expectations on both top and bottom lines today, with $2.22 per share on $9.88 billion both improvements over the $2.12 and $9.86 billion estimated, respectively. The airline major saw its shares sell off in late trading, as well, likely based on weaker-than-expected passenger revenues and higher costs related to fuel and labor.

The company missed estimates for active buyer totals in the quarter by about 3 million (to 168 million actualized), even amid efforts to drive site traffic in the quarter. Shares fell 5% upon the Q3 release.

3221,EBAY,"On Tuesday, shares of department store Macy’s Inc. (M  -  Free Report) are gaining, up over 4% in late-morning trading after the company announced a major restructuring plan that could be exactly what the struggling retailer needs.Macy’s said it will be cutting 100 jobs as part of a consolidation plan to unite its merchandising, planning, and private brands operations into one department. The company also said the plan will save Macy’s an estimated $30 million a year, including roughly $5 million, or a penny per share, for the fourth quarter of 2017. But, the change will also mean one-time costs of approximately $20 million to $25 million, taking effect mostly in the third quarter, according to Macy’s.The company has also named a new president, bringing in former eBay (EBAY  -  Free Report) executive Hal Lawton. Lawton has previously worked for The Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report) and McKinsey & Co., a management consulting firm; he will begin his tenure on September 8.Macy's CEO Jeff Gennette commended Lawton's ""deep expertise at the intersection of retail and technology, a diverse set of business experiences that give him a unique perspective, and a track record of successfully driving a change agenda at scale.""This is a key step,"" Gennette added, ""as we look to further transform the business and work through the volatility of today’s retail landscape.""At eBay, Lawton was in charge of marketing, merchandising, and consumer selling, and has a strong background in technology and digital expertise, all things that will be vital to Macy’s has the department store giant makes big moves to revitalize its business.Additionally, Macy’s is getting ready to roll out its off-price division, Macy’s Backstage, in more of its store locations, as well as strengthen its beauty business, leveraging its recent acquisition of Bluemercury, notes CNBC. The company launching a new loyalty program that will officially hit the market in October.Macy’s In-DepthMacy’s is currently a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank, with a VGM score of ‘A.’ Though its industry, Retail-Regional Department Stores, has lost almost 36% year-to-date, it sits in the top 43% of all 265 industries ranked on the Zacks Industry Rank.This past quarter, Macy’s surpassed analyst expectations on both the top and bottom lines, though the company still expects comparable sales for the full year to decline by 2.2% to 3.3%. Looking ahead, earnings are expected to grow about 7% for the current year, while sales are projected to decline nearly 4% in the same time frame.From a value perspective, Macy’s is very cheap, with a P/E of only 5.85. The stock has depreciated over time too, losing about have its value over the last 12 months—its P/E a year ago was around 10.5—and demonstrating the brutal environment of traditional brick-and-mortar retail.Macy’s value story also reflects the so-called “perceived value” among retailers. Nordstrom (JWN  -  Free Report), for instance, has a P/E right now of 14.9. Macy’s and Nordstrom are in the same industry and arguably have suffered many of the same problems. The only difference is that investors have always been willing to pay more for JWN because of the company’s perceived high-status among retailers, a factor that has worked in their favor with shareholders and customers.Right now, people don’t equate “high-end” with Macy’s. But bringing in executives like Mr. Lawton, and working to utilize acquisitions like Bluemercury, and rethinking what it means to do retail in the twenty-first century may help Macy’s reach that icon status once again.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

3225,EBAY,"Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) announced plans to expand what types of products will be listed in its Craigslist-like Marketplace, including auto and ticket sales.Launched this past October, Facebook Marketplace facilitates peer-to-peer shopping. Using Facebook profiles, users can find out more information about the person they’re buying from or selling to, while its integration with Facebook Messenger allows users to haggle prices and arrange meet-ups.Facebook has previously limited posting in the Marketplace to individual pages. If a user wanted to buy tickets or a specific item, they would have to visit a company’s shopping page. Now, Facebook is allowing businesses to enter the Marketplace directly.However, Facebook doesn’t know exactly which products people will want to buy, so the social media giant will experiment with different offerings before moving into the most popular areas.“We’ll kind of look and see what’s popular, what people want to engage with,” said Deb Liu, the Facebook VP who oversees Marketplace, in an interview with Recode. “So if people are searching or looking for something, we want to make that available to them.”One such area will be auto sales, with Marketplace featuring local car dealerships. Facebook also intends to integrate real estate listings.Facebook has not announced if it will be partnering with any specific companies in these areas. But the company has already collaborated with eBay (EBAY  -  Free Report) to offer Facebook users daily deals from eBay directly in Facebook’s app, so additional partnerships could happen in the future.Shares of Facebook closed the day up 0.30% on Friday at $167.41 per share.4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye on Tech stocks have been a major force behind the market’s record highs, but picking the best ones to buy can be tough. There’s a simple way to invest in the success of the entire sector. Zacks has just released a Special Report revealing one thing tech companies literally cannot function without.

3226,EBAY,"From a span of a day to two hours, from two hours to fifteen minutes, and now from fifteen minutes to two minutes, Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) is cutting down on its delivery time to Prime members.The company on Tuesday launched the 'Instant Pickup' service for Prime and Prime Student members that will get ordered items ready in just two minutes.Amazon Prime members are already enjoying free two-day and one-day deliveries. Additionally, there is Prime Now, a service that ensures that members get free two-hour delivery on select items. Also, Amazon Restaurants offers one-hour delivery for Prime members from popular restaurants. AmazonFresh grocery delivery service can fulfill orders within 15 minutes if users pay $15 per month.Shares of Amazon have gained 30.4% year to date, significantly underperforming the industry’s 46.4% rally.About the ServiceShoppers can now order from a range of fast-selling items such as drinks, snacks and phone chargers using the Amazon mobile app. The company staff will place these in lockers at instant pickup points within two minutes.  Shoppers can pick them up by accessing the locker with a bar code sent to them.At launch, the service is available at five college campuses: University of California at Berkeley, Columbus, Atlanta, Ohio and College Park, Maryland. The company plans to expand this service to other places by the end of this year.Amazon’s Three-fold StrategyThe move underscores Amazon latest efforts to counter slow growth in e-commerce and competition from the likes of Alibaba (BABA  -  Free Report) and eBay (EBAY  -  Free Report). Since the company announced its acquisition of Whole Foods Market Inc.  for a whopping $13.7 billion, there’s been a lot of speculation about reorganization options. That said, the new move makes sense as many items sold by Whole Foods are difficult to shift online.Amazon.com, Inc. Net Income (TTM) Amazon.com, Inc. Net Income (TTM) | Amazon.com, Inc. QuoteIt has added online and offline features to its bookstores and is going the same way with innovations such as drive-in-grocery delivery service (AmazonFresh Pickup - order groceries online and collect them from a store nearby). The new move appears to be another innovation of this kind.It also appears that Amazon is trying to tap the impulse buyer group with this move, a market that has largely been served by brick-and-mortar stores.Lastly, Amazon continues pushing advantages to Prime members to boost sales, attract more customers and counter Prime saturation in the U.S. due to increased penetration rates.A solid loyalty system in Prime has kept Amazon’s retail business unbeatable on price, choice and convenience. Prime memberships help in repeat sales of not just general merchandise but also media (books, music, video, etc).Currently, Amazon has a Zacks #5 (Strong Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

3227,EBAY,"Groupon Inc. (GRPN  -  Free Report) is set to release second-quarter 2017 earnings on Aug 2. We note that the company has delivered positive earnings surprises in the preceding four quarters, resulting in an average positive surprise of 87.32%.In the last quarter, the company reported loss of 2 cents per share compared with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 5 cents. Revenues of $673.6 million missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $717.1 million and also declined 3.6% on a year-over-year basis.Management expects EBITDA to decline sequentially as the company plans to continue its investments in marketing and offline campaigning activities. However, EBITDA is expected to increase year on year.Notably, the company has underperformed the industry it belongs to on a year-to-date basis. While the industry gained 50.9%, the stock returned 14.5%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to Consider    Groupon continues to exit international markets as part of its restructuring plans. It intends to shift its focus on local business from goods. In the first quarter, the company reduced its country presence to 15. This is anticipated to be a positive as it gives it the ability to focus more on the better performing zones.Notably, in the last reported quarter, the company added 500K new customer in North America, thereby adding to its revenues from the region. North American gross profit also increased 2.3%.Moreover, expansion of adjusted EBITDA margin to 6.6% and a decline in operating expenses and operating loss indicate the successful implementation of the company’s streamlining initiatives.Groupon, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Groupon, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Groupon, Inc. QuoteWe believe that the shifting of Groupon Goods from a lower-margin focused business to a higher-margin business will boost profitability. However, competition from giants like eBay (EBAY  -  Free Report) and Amazon remains a concern.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Groupon is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Groupon’s Earnings ESP is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at a loss of 4 cents per share. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Groupon carries a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with a 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Kemet Corporation (KEM  -  Free Report) with an Earnings ESP of +11.1% and a Zacks Rank #1.

Shares fell 5.19% in after-hours trading in response to the earnings miss.Adjusted earnings per share exclude one-time items but include stock-based compensation expense.In the quarter, increase in cost of revenues and operating expenses (predominantly sales and marketing) weighed on eBay’s bottom line.Revenues of $2.33 billion, however, beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a slight margin and came ahead of the guided range.Revenue growth was driven by strength in international markets, increase in active buyers, expansion of new user experience and brand advertising. eBay added 2 million active buyers in the second quarter taking the total to 171 million.Management appeared to be impressed with the progress of replatforming efforts. The company continues to strengthen its core platform and improve user experience. The company accelerated its efforts by building product catalogs on structured data, enhancing mobile platform, rolling out new browse inspired shopping journeys, rejuvenating customer-to-customer (C2C) business and strengthening its brand.In the second quarter, eBay collaborated with Shopify to allow sellers to synchronize inventory information, sell products ordered on eBay and view eBay buyer messages directly from Shopify accounts. The company partnered with Disney to offer exclusive Pirates of the Caribbean merchandise. It also rolled out nest and EGI as new brands on its platform. eBay also has extended its price matching program to the U.K. The company’s new home page has been expanded to eight geographies.Overall, we remain positive on eBay’s replatforming and brand enhancement initiatives. Its unique capabilities backed by technological improvements give it an edge over competitors such as Etsy (ETSY  -  Free Report), Alibaba (BABA  -  Free Report) and Facebook (FB  -  Free Report).However, expected results may take some time to show up due to weak global economy, slow e-commerce growth and increasing competition.

3232,EBAY,"Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) blew the doors off earnings estimates after the bell today, posting EPS of 98 cents per share in its fiscal Q4, easily surpassing the 71 cents per share expected in the Zacks consensus estimate. Revenues were also better than expected, albeit less so, putting up $24.7 billion as opposed to the $24.2 billion in our consensus.Poking into the earnings report a little, Microsoft's Azure revenue growth stands out at +98% year over year. Azure is the company's enterprise cloud-computing platform. Commercial cloud revenues overall came in at $18.9 billion. Productivity revenue rose 21% year over year to $8.4 billion, which was in-line with estimates. Windows PC revenue gained 1%, whereas Surface slipped 2% in the quarter.Microsoft shares are trading up in the after market today, but currently by less than a full percentage point. Keep in mind this stock has been strong in 2017 -- +19.5% year to date -- as well as year over year -- +38%. Yet at 21x earnings, Microsoft does not appear to be a stock priced for perfection.Visa (V  -  Free Report), however, may just be. The credit card giant is up roughly 25% year to date, and currently trading near all-time highs. The company also beat fiscal Q3 estimates on the top and bottom lines: 86 cents per share versus 80 cents expected, on revenues of $4.57 billion which easily outpaced the $4.36 billion in the Zacks consensus. An impressive 28.5 billion transactions were processed by Visa in the quarter. This marks at least the fifth-straight earnings beat for Visa.Finally, eBay (EBAY  -  Free Report) shows mixed Q2 results after the bell today. Earnings of 34 cents per share (accounting for stock-based employee compensation and other before nonrecurring items) missed the Zacks consensus of 36 cents. But $2.33 billion in sales was marginally better than the $2.31 billion expected. But Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV) came in at $20.5 billion, notably beneath the $21.4 billion analysts had been looking for. The company also reduced Q3 EPS guidance, and shares in late trading are currently down 3%.

3233,EBAY,"“Change is the only constant” – this one liner summarizes the state of all consumer-driven industries at the moment, as consumers’ accelerated shift toward online shopping has hit several industries, like apparel/shoe, departmental stores, and the food industry among others. A major player in the food industry, Campbell Soup Company (CPB  -  Free Report) is also striving to keep up with these evolving trends, in order to serve consumers better and tap greater sales.Moving on these lines, this convenience foods products behemoth provided details on its four key strategies at its annual investor day yesterday, alongside reiterating its fiscal 2017 and long-term forecasts.Can Latest Plans Save CPB Stock?Campbell’s four strategies include plans to win consumers’ confidence via real food and raised transparency; speedy e-Commerce and digital marketing endeavors; maintaining focus on portfolio diversification; and strengthening its footprint in the growing snacking space. Shares of the company grew 3.1% in yesterday’s trading session.However, Campbell has slumped 17% in the last one year, underperforming the Zacks categorized Food – Miscellaneous/Diversified industry that lost 10.8%. This could be largely accountable to Campbell’s waning top line which hasn’t witnessed a single year-over-year improvement for quite some time now. So let’s delve deeper into the plans outlined at the investor day, and see if they can save the day for this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Four Core Strategies in DetailFocus on Real Food Philosophy & TransparencyCampbell remains focused on its real food philosophy, as part of which it plans to invest nearly $50 million to develop products as per the changing consumer preferences. Also, the company inked a deal with The Sage Project to reveal its ingredients online by leveraging Sage’s food data platform. Sage is engaged in offering online food labels, providing information on several attributes associated with food like ingredients, nutritional value and calories. Thus, partnership with Sage will enhance Campbell’s food transparency to its customers. Notably, Campbell is also on track to bring its real food philosophy to its soups category, and achieve significant results by the end of this year. In fact, it’s Well Yes! Soup will mark the company’s first product on Sage’s platform.Robust Digital Endeavors Bode WellAmazon.com, Inc.’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) takeover of Whole Foods Market, Inc.  is testimony to the fact that e-Commerce has gained significant ground in the food industry. That said, Campbell is on track to strengthen its digital operations. Incidentally, the company announced plans to build an e-Commerce unit in North America, which will represent Campbell’s all three segments. Management appointed Shakeel Farooque to lead this e-Commerce team and anticipates delivering online sales of roughly $300 million in the next five years. Farooque’s past experience with behemoths like Amazon, eBay Inc. (EBAY  -  Free Report) and Kohl's Corporation (KSS  -  Free Report) is likely to benefit Campbell, given his combined knowledge of consumers and technology. Well, Campbell’s focus on e-Commerce is also evident from its recently announced $10 million investment in online meal kit firm, Chef’d.Adding Organic Foods to Portfolio Should Lure ConsumersThe organic food space that surged at a compound annual growth rate of 15.3% in the last four years has become an over $11 billion category in the country. This is mainly due to consumers’ evolving preferences for healthy, fresh and organic food products. Thus, Campbell has been undertaking several steps to diversify its portfolio and expand in the fast-growing organic space. In this regard, the company recently announced plans to acquire leading organic broth and soup producer, Pacific Foods. This marked the company’s fifth buyout in the last five years. Other buyouts in this connection include Bolthouse Farms, Plums Organics and Garden Fresh Gourmet. Thanks to these buyouts, the company’s organic kitty currently ranks among the top 10 in the industry. Also, annual fresh products sales have reached approximately $1 billion, reflecting prospects of this category.Concentration on Growing Snacks UnitWith the growing demand for snacks, Campbell plans to undertake significant expansion at its Global Biscuits and Snacks’ segment, in fiscal 2018. The company plans to solidify this segment’s footprint geographically, and also go beyond its existing biscuits and bakes snack items. The company plans to prepare snacks using real food ingredients, which is also in sync with its first strategy. Also, the company plans to introduce soups, small meals and fresh snacks, which are expected to augment overall sales by about $200 million in the next five years.We believe that these strategies reflect Campbell’s commitment toward establishing a differentiated and significant position with the consumers’ community and in the food industry. In addition to elaborating on its strategic imperatives, management reaffirmed its fiscal 2017 and long-term goals, while it provided an update on its cost savings and cash flow targets for the fiscal.Fiscal 2017 & Long-Term OutlookManagement anticipates sales growth for fiscal 2017 to range from negative 1% to flat. Adjusted EBIT is expected to rise 2–4% year over year, while gross margin is anticipated to be 38%. Adjusted earnings for the fiscal are envisioned to grow in the range of 3–5% to $3.04–$3.09 per share. Coming to cash flows from operations, Campbell expects generating roughly $1.25 billion this fiscal. Also, the company plans to achieve cost savings worth $310 million by the end of fiscal 2017.Moving to the long term, management still projects organic sales growth in a range of 1–3%. Further, adjusted EBIT growth is envisioned in a band of 4– 6% and adjusted EPS is expected to grow 5–7% over the long term (both on a constant currency basis). Finally, the company continues to project cost savings from its ongoing initiatives to be around $450 million (roughly 6% of sales) by the end of fiscal 2020. Management plans to issue its fiscal 2018 outlook, along with its fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results that are scheduled for Aug 31.3 Top Picks to Ride the Hottest Tech TrendZacks just released a Special Report to guide you through a space that has already begun to transform our entire economy...Last year, it was generating $8 billion in global revenues.
