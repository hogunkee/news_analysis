0,FRT,"Investors' appetite for safety and yields was evident Tuesday as real estate investment trust and utility stocks dominated the new highs. Among REITs, several broke out, providing opportunities for those braving the weak general-market conditions. The sector is acting well, as the appeal of consistent dividends draws investors fleeing shrinking yields in the bond market. Federal Realty (FRT) broke out…

1,FRT,"How large of an investment opportunity is being created by the upcoming Sept. 1 expansion of the familiar 10 major sectors with the debut of a new, 11th sector devoted to real estate, in benchmarks such as the S&P 500 and others run by S&P Dow Jones Indices and MSCI?The impact could be big.Real estate stocks -- and the mutual funds holding many of them -- stand to get a windfall infusion of billions of dollars. Diversified stock funds would have to buy more than $100 billion of REIT stocks to wipe out their real-estate underweights relative to their benchmarks, according to JPMorgan. Investors, including many of those funds, are already buying REITs, says Mike Grupe, executive vice president of research and investor outreach of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT).""That sort of inflow could drive up stock prices,"" said Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF and mutual fund research for S&P Global Market Intelligence. ""Shareholders in funds holding real estate stocks could see at least a short-term bump up.""That's more likely to benefit shareholders in real-estate sector funds than U.S. diversified stock funds. Diversified funds are likely to be buyers, says Gregg Fisher, chief investment officer of investment management firm Gerstein Fisher and lead manager of three of its funds. Sector funds are already fully exposed to real estate.Still, diversified funds that are underweight also might boost their real estate weighting, says J. Scott Craig, manager of $43 million Eaton Vance Real Estate Fund (EIREX). ""If they hear from consultants and clients who look at fund reports (after Sept. 1) that show sector weightings, they might be pushed to act. Especially if their real estate weighting is still 0%, it could be a stark number.""Many mutual funds are bulking up on real estate stocks, including REITs, because their respective investment mandates call for them to hew to some degree to their benchmark's sector weightings, Grupe says. But no one knows how much in REIT stocks will eventually be bought, Rosenbluth says.As a result of the change, which was decided in late 2014, real estate will be broken out from the financial sector, of which it is now part.Real estate made up 2.45% of the S&P 500 Index and 3.19% of the MSCI ACWI global index as of March 31, according to Morningstar Inc. The average U.S. stock fund had a real estate weighting of  2.3%, compared with 4.4% for their benchmarks, as of Dec. 31.""REITs will also draw money simply because of increased exposure,"" Fisher said.With more attention drawn to real estate, more investors will chase the group's recent performance. Real estate funds were up 6.37% this year on average through June 16 vs. 0.82% for the average U.S. diversified stock fund, according to Lipper Inc. Also, they're up 11.42% over the past 52 weeks vs. a 5.26% loss for U.S. diversifieds.And REITs' outlook is attractive to many investors. Economic growth, even if it is slow, props up demand for real estate, Grupe says.And because share-price performance by real estate has a low correlation to stocks and bonds, real estate offers investors an attractive way to cut portfolio volatility stemming from those other asset classes.For example, U.S. stocks averaged only a 0.55 correlation to U.S. REITs from 1990 through 2015, according to Cohen & Steers. That means their performance resembled those of REITs by only a little more than 50%. U.S. bonds had only a 0.19 correlation to REITs.Fisher, whose investment approach is basically quantitative, says that CoreSite (COR) is a holding that illustrates the types of stocks that should draw new investor inflow.He says the stock has attractive metrics, such as price momentum and relative valuation.IBD readers are likely to notice that the stock has a 99 Composite Rating, the highest possible. The Composite Rating combines IBD's five performance ratings, including EPS and Relative Strength ratings. Stocks poised to move higher often have a high Composite Rating.It also has a 2.6% dividend yield.Craig's favorite segment going forward is apartment REITs. An expansion of supply amid slower revenue growth has hurt the segment, he says. But he likes Equity Residential (EQR) because it has been oversold. ""Investors have been right about the direction of the impact of slower revenue growth but wrong about the magnitude,"" he said.Equity Residential's focus is in coastal cities, where the apartment markets are strongest. New housing supply in those markets has hurt EQR's fundamentals, he says, but only ""quite modestly.""Craig also likes AvalonBay (AVB) and Essex Property (ESS), other apartment REITs that investors have oversold.AvalonBay is the biggest developer of apartment REITs, he says. And like EQR, it has heavy exposure to the ""sexy six"" -- Boston, Manhattan, the District of Columbia, Seattle, San Francisco and Los Angeles. ""These, I believe, are the six best long-term real estate markets in the U.S.,"" he said. ""They have highly educated work forces, high average household income, high cost of single-family housing, significant barriers to new construction and diversified economies. Those characteristics lead to greater rent growth and property price appreciation over the long term.""Essex, he adds, is a West Coast pure play. Avalon and Essex have dividend yields of 3.1% and 3%, respectively.In addition, he likes Federal Realty (FRT), a REIT with a 2.4% dividend yield, whose stock is not beaten down, he says. ""This REIT's portfolio includes a number of successful mixed-use properties, and it can add more of the same,"" he said.Grupe likes the office segment because new supply has been limited, he says, while demand keeps rising.And he likes self storage. ""We love our stuff,"" Grupe says about Americans. Economic growth enables people to pay for storing it.

2,FRT,"Managers of the best-performing mutual funds the past three months have been nibbling recently on top-rated stocks, which have recovered some of January's steep losses.Major indexes rallied sharply in the second half of the Valentine's month as investors bottom-fed on leading stocks at lower prices. The S&P 500 trimmed its loss to just 0.4% in February, while the Nasdaq was off 1.2%.Leading stock mutual funds have shown interests in defensive sectors like food processors, financial stocks, and in utility firms in recent months.In a slowing economy, investors often flock to food companies such as Hormel (HRL), Cal-Maine (CALM) and Tyson (TSN). Both Hormel and Tyson have performed well in the past year, hitting new highs along the way.Click Here To See A List Of New Buys Of Top Mutual Funds Among financial issues, top funds are seeking steady gains in REITs, such as Agree Realty (ADC), Equity Lifestyle Properties (ELS), Kimco Realty (KIM), Federal Realty Trust (FRT) and Sun Communities (SUI).Credit card payment processor and Leaderboard stock, PayPal (PYPL), was also added by leading funds in their latest reporting periods.Another area worth a gander is utilities, including ITC Holdings (ITC), CMS Energy (CMS), and Pinnacle West Capital (PNW).Telecom giant Verizon Communication (VZ) found its way onto top-performing funds' buy list. Fifteen leading funds added Verizon, investing an estimated $108.7 million in their latest reporting periods.The New York-based firm got a big marketing boost when J.D. Power ranked Verizon Wireless highest in network quality across six regions among U.S. wireless providers.IBD spotted four best-performing funds tapping into PayPal, investing an estimated $5.6 million. The $41.5 billion T. Rowe Price Growth Stock Fund (PRFGX) added shares in its latest reporting period.The mobile and online payment processor was spun off from long-time parent, eBay (EBAY), in July last year. It also owns the popular mobile payment app, Venmo.Now that PayPal is standing on its own two feet, the San Jose, Calif.-based firm stands to grow its mobile payment segment, particularly the in-store mobile wallet, competing with Alphabet/Google Android Pay, Apple Pay and Samsung Pay.At the Mobile World Congress, PayPal announced partnerships with Vodafone (VOD) and America Movil (AMX) subsidiaries Telco and Claro in Latin America. This means that in Europe, Mexico and Brazil, phones will have the PayPal-powered mobile wallet already installed in them. Through these partnerships, PayPal can offer merchants and consumers more flexibility and choices in how they want to pay and get paid. Because PayPal doesn't own its operating platforms and is not connected to any devices, it has a broad scope for growth.PayPal doesn't have a long trading history, but the stock has been setting up a good-looking shallow base since its July 20 IPO. It's creeping near its 42.65 buy point. PayPal's Q4 earnings grew 24% to 36 cents a share, ex items. Revenue growth rose 17% to $2.6 billion.The country's top-rated funds have been unloading medical stocks, such as Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Henry Schein (HSIC) and Quest Diagnostics (DGX), in their latest reporting periods. Large caps Illinois Tool Works (ITW) and 3M (MMM) have also been sold by leading funds.There were seven top funds selling computer-graphics chip maker Nvidia (NVDA), while only 1 fund bought, leaving six net-selling funds.

4,FRT,"It's been a rough start for the stock market in 2016, so it's not surprising to see defensive areas of the market like utilities and real estate investment trusts setting up for possible upside moves.Both groups are known for delivering solid yields, and with growth stocks generally out of favor for now, institutional money has been quietly flowing into each group.Bullish setups abound in the utility group from the likes of American Electric Power (AEP), Scana (SCG) and WEC Energy (WEC).But the REIT group is home to compelling setups as well. Digital Realty (DLR) has emerged as the leader in the REIT group and already has cleared a buy point, but plenty of other names are attracting interest.Institutional investors were accumulating shares of DuPont Fabros Technology (DFT) late last year as it worked on the right side of a cup-shaped base. A handle area has been forming that shows a 33.72 buy point.Headquartered in Washington, D.C., the company operates 12 multi-tenant wholesale data centers in four major markets. Data centers remain in high demand as companies like Internet content providers, health care and financial firms outsource their data-management needs. Annual pretax margin (29.8%) and return on equity (8.9%) at DuPont hit multiyear highs in 2014. It currently yields around 6%.Elsewhere in the group, Realty Income (O) is holding its own as it sits just above a 52.70 buy point. Its specialty is triple-net leases, in which the tenant is responsible for paying a building's property taxes, building insurance and maintenance costs. Realty Income currently yields 4.4%.Finally, Federal Realty Investment Trust (FRT) is trading tightly and still in a buy range from a 145.68 entry. The company operates retail and mixed-used properties in the Northwest, Mid-Atlantic and California.

39,FRT,"We are in the heart of the Q1 reporting cycle and the real estate investment trust (REIT) space is bustling with activity as there is a deluge of Q1 earnings releases lined up for this week, including Essex Property Trust, Inc. (ESS  -  Free Report), Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. (MAA  -  Free Report), The Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report), Federal Realty Investment Trust (FRT  -  Free Report), Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. (HST  -  Free Report) and Equinix, Inc. (EQIX  -  Free Report). These companies are slated to release their quarterly numbers on May 2.Per our latest Earnings Preview, total Finance Sector earnings, of which REITs are a part, for the Jan-Mar quarter are expected to increase 27% based on 4.7% increase in revenues, as compared with the prior-year quarter.Particularly, with underlying asset categories and the location of properties playing a vital role in determining REITs’ performance, not all the companies in this space are equally poised to excel or fall behind, this season.Let’s have a close look at the factors that will impact the above-mentioned REITs’ first-quarter results.Mid-America Apartment Communities — commonly known as MAA — maintains a well-balanced portfolio in the Southeast and the Southwest regions of the United States. Further, favorable demographics and strong job growth in target markets are anticipated to drive demand for MAA’s properties. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter total revenues is currently pegged at $385 million, denoting projected growth of 1.6% year over year.Notably, per the latest report from the real estate technology and analytics firm — RealPage, Inc. (RP  -  Free Report) — the national apartment market remained moderated in first-quarter 2018. Annual rent growth slipped to 2.3% in Q1 which marked moderation from the 2.6-2.9% growth rate experienced throughout 2017. Occupancy level of 94.5% in March edged down from the prior-year tally of 95%. Nevertheless, the overall occupancy level is still healthy and the first quarter usually marks a slow leasing period, thanks to the cold weather that inhibits shift of householdsFurther, there is an increasing apartment supply in a number of markets of MAA. This high supply is likely to put pressure on rental rates in the to-be-reported quarter. In addition, there is high-concession activity amid elevated supply, which remains a concern.The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $1.46, which indicates no movement on a year-over-year basis. (Read more: Mid-America Apartment Q1 Earnings: What's in Store?)Our proven model does not conclusively show that MAA is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here, as you will see below.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Although the company has an Earnings ESP of +0.78%, an unfavorable Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) makes it difficult for our proven model to conclusively predict a likely earnings beat this season.However, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, which is depicted in the graph below:Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.

42,FRT,"Federal Realty Investment Trust (FRT  -  Free Report) is set to report first-quarter 2018 results after the market closes on May 2. Both its revenues and funds from operations (FFO) are anticipated to experience year-over-year growth.In the last reported quarter, this retail real estate investment trust (REIT) delivered in-line results with respect to FFO per share. Results reflected growth in revenues. However, the company’s proactive releasing efforts to reposition properties had an adverse effect on its quarterly results.The company has a decent surprise history with earnings surpassing estimates in three of the trailing four quarters while meeting in one. This resulted in an average positive surprise of 1.37%. The graph below depicts the surprise history of the company:Federal Realty Investment Trust Price and EPS Surprise Federal Realty Investment Trust Price and EPS Surprise | Federal Realty Investment Trust QuoteLet’s see how things have shaped up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderFederal Realty has been taking advantage of the redevelopment opportunities. Amid a fast-evolving retail environment, the company is making strategic efforts to reposition, redevelop and re-merchandise its portfolio. These efforts will help the company to counter competition from e-retailers.Subsequently, minimum rents from the retail and commercial segment are likely to record sequential growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $153 million indicates marginal growth of 1.3% compared with the prior quarter. Total rental income is projected to be $220 million, which remains stable from the prior-quarter tally.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues is pegged at $223.8 million, indicating a year-over-year improvement of 7.9%.However, rising consumer purchases through the Internet emerged as a pressing concern for this REIT. These made retailers reconsider their footprints and eventually opt for store closures. Also, retailers, who are not able to cope with competition, are filing for bankruptcies.Accordingly, percentage rents, which indicate additional rent based on the level of sales achieved by the tenant, are predicted to witness a considerable decline due to the tepid retail environment. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.02 million reflects a 16.6% decline compared with the prior quarter.Moreover, Federal Realty’s activities during the reported quarter could not gain adequate analyst confidence. Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Q1 FFO per share remained stable at $1.50 in a month’s time. However, it indicates rise of 3.5% year-over-year.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Federal Realty is likely to beat on earnings this season. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, that is not the case here as you will see below.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Federal Realty is -0.29%.Zacks Rank: Federal Realty’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP.

43,FRT,"Retail REIT Federal Realty Investment Trust (FRT  -  Free Report) is likely to remain on the growth curve backed by its premium retail assets, diverse tenant base and efforts to improve operating performance through expansion, renovation and re-tenanting support long-term profitability. However, the choppy retail real estate environment and portfolio redevelopment efforts might limit the company’s growth tempo in the near term.Recently, Federal Realty reported fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted funds from operations (FFO) per share of $1.47, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Adjusted FFO per share also compared favorably with the prior-year quarter tally of $1.45. Results reflect growth in revenues. However, the company’s proactive releasing efforts to reposition properties had an adverse impact on its quarterly results.Specifically, Federal Realty has a portfolio of premium retail assets — mainly situated in the major coastal markets from Washington, D.C. to Boston, San Francisco and Los Angeles — which positions it well for decent growth. Again, due to the strong demographics and in-fill nature of its properties, the company has been able to maintain a high occupancy and rental rates.In addition, Federal Realty has a decent balance-sheet position, with ample liquidity and is continuing with its efforts to boost shareholders’ wealth. The company has paid uninterrupted dividends since its inception in 1962 and its compound annual growth rate of dividend increases over the past 50 years is above 7%. Given the company’s financial position and lower debt-to-equity ratio compared to that of the industry, this dividend rate is expected to be sustainable.However, shrinking footfall at malls amid shift of consumers toward online channels, store closures and bankruptcy of retailers have emerged as pressing concerns for most retail REITs, including Simon Property Group, Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report), GGP Inc. (GGP  -  Free Report), The Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report), Federal Realty and others.Additionally, amid a fast changing retail environment, the company is making commendable efforts to reposition, redevelop and re-merchandise its portfolio. This includes an upgradation of the tenant mix. Although repositioning and redevelopment are a strategic fit for long-term growth, such initiatives involve considerable upfront costs and tend to drag down near-term profitability. In fact, the company’s proactive releasing efforts to reposition properties had an adverse impact on its recently-reported quarterly results.Moreover, rise in interest rate can pose a challenge for Federal Realty. This is because the company’s ability to refinance its existing debt would be restricted, while interest cost on new debt will increase. This could adversely affect the company’s financial results and consequently dent its dividend payout. Also, the dividend payout might become less attractive than the yields on fixed income and money market accounts.Amid these, shares of Federal Realty have underperformed the industry it belongs to, over the past three months, depreciating 11.3% as against the 8.0% loss incurred by the industry. Nevertheless, reflecting bullish analyst sentiment, the stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share for first-quarter 2018 being revised 0.7% upward in a month’s time.

In addition, the company has made concerted efforts to support omni-channel retailing, which is encouraging.

45,FRT,"The Federal Reserve didn’t raise interest rates at the latest FOMC meeting. But with inflation nearing its target 2% mark, the market expects the central bank to stay the course and raise rates at least two more times this year and three times next.This seemingly hawkish Fed stance would typically be a negative backdrop for REITs, but the space appears to have done adequate preparation for this monetary policy tightening cycle. Stronger balance sheets, fixed rate borrowings and extended maturities are some of the notable features that are giving REITs the flexibility to operate in the current environment. This financial flexibility is encouraging down the line for their operational efficiencies.Moreover, high consumer confidence in an improving economy and job market gains are fueling consumption levels. In fact, with one eventually requiring “real space” for economic activities, prospects of the real estate sector are getting a boost as growth in the economy translates into greater demand for real estate and higher occupancy levels.Further, valuation-wise, several REIT stocks seem attractive, while encouraging performance by a number of REITs in Q1 as well as an increase in merger and acquisition activities in the industry point at the prevailing favorable environment. Further with the inflation level creeping up, one must keep in mind that REIT dividend growth has surpassed inflation (as measured by Consumer Price Index), in 18 of the past 20 years.All these provide enough incentive to investors to delve into the fundamentals of the individual asset segment of the REIT industry.Industrial REITsIndustrial REITs are indeed firing on all cylinders, and per a study by the commercial real estate services firm CBRE Group Inc. (CBRE  -  Free Report), availability fell for 31 straight quarters to 7.3% for the U.S. industrial market in first-quarter 2018. Moreover, with demand surpassing new supply, net asking rents climbed 1.9% in Q1 to $7.01 per square feet, denoting the highest level since 1989.In fact, to support e-commerce business, address a large customer base and urbanization, companies are being compelled to enhance and renovate their distribution and production platforms. Services like same-day delivery are gaining traction, propelling demand for modern distribution facilities. Also, last-mile properties are witnessing a solid increase in asset values.Going forward, with a recovering economy and job market gains as well as tax reforms, consumption levels are anticipated to remain elevated. And with a healthy manufacturing environment and high business inventories, demand for warehouse and logistics real estate is anticipated to be high.Data Center, Cell Tower REITsIn addition to industrial REITs, e-commerce is also driving demand for data center and cell tower REITs. This is because, when demand is placed through smartphones, tablets or computers, the order is transmitted through cell towers and processed at data centers. In fact, without the offering of this critical infrastructure, the e-commerce value chain simply cannot sustain and therefore REITs, which happen to own many of these cell towers and data centers, are expected to benefit substantially.Along with making purchases online, an increasing number of people are consuming digital content. Estimated growth rate for the markets of artificial intelligence, Internet of Things, autonomous vehicle and virtual/augmented reality are also anticipated to remain robust over the next five to eight years. In addition, the deployment of 5G network should drive growth of tower and fiber business as wireless carriers look to expand and enhance their networks. Therefore, along with an improved outlook for economic growth, all these only make us hugely optimistic about extensive growth in demand for space at cell tower and data-center REITs.Retail REITsDespite several preeminent retail bankruptcy filings and record-high defaults by retail corporates, recent data from Reis, which Reuters had cited, shows that U.S. retail real estate vacancies was 10% in the first quarter of 2018 -- unchanged for the fourth consecutive quarter. Admittedly, consumer confidence is still high. Moreover, the stability clearly reflects the benefit from concerted efforts of the retail landlords to boost productivity of retail assets by trying to grab attention from new and productive tenants and disposing the non-productive ones. Also, with limited retail supply, refurbishment of existing properties is gaining traction.Retail REITs are now avoiding heavy dependence on apparel and accessories, and rather expanding dining options, opening movie theaters, offering recreational facilities and opening fitness centers in particular. Also, amid the changing landscape in the retail real estate market, prime properties continue to enjoy strong demand, though class B and lower properties are experiencing a decline in occupancies. With the recent tax overhaul likely to benefit wages, consumer confidence and consumption levels, demand for prime properties is anticipated to remain strong in the rest of the year.Residential REITsIn the national apartment market, despite high supply and a seasonally slow first-quarter leasing period, thanks to the cold weather that inhibits shift of households, the occupancy level remained elevated and came in at 94.5% this March, just a notch lower than the prior-year tally of 95%, per the latest report from the real estate technology and analytics firm RealPage, Inc. (RP  -  Free Report).Moreover, solid job growth in recent months indicates more household formations and raises expectations for still healthy apartment market occupancy despite high deliveries in the near term. Also, shortages of construction labor and rising expenses might somewhat impede the growth momentum of supply.Student Housing REITsFor student housing real estate market, there is stability in performance per a report by RealPage. Specifically, an increasing number of giveaways being offered and proximity to campus are aiding the healthy leasing volumes of this sector. Nonetheless, this sector has witnessed slight moderation in rent growth.In fact, with a significant salary differential between college graduates and high-school graduates, college enrolment is set to increase. This will likely drive demand for residential units that are leased by student housing REITs. Also, demand is emanating for on-campus developments from universities that are facing state budget cuts and low funds. And on-campus housing usually enjoys full occupancy.Office REITsIn the office sector too, though supply of new office space has slightly pushed up vacancy levels (by 20 bps) to 13.3% in Q1, per a CBRE Group data, demand for high-quality, efficient space remains strong. This is indicated by the pre-leasing of around 70% of space being delivered in Q1.While higher construction with increased completions might moderate the pace of growth in the primary markets, suburban markets are likely to excel with increased population and growth in employment. Per the data from CBRE Group, for the fifth straight quarter, annual rent growth in suburban markets (2.3%) surpassed that of the downtown markets (0.2%).Hotel REITsIn case of hotel REITs too, an improving economy, growth in employment and rise in wages are likely to drive demand for hotels. Particularly, improved business travel demand with lower cancellations and higher group spends, plus strong demand from leisure division signal better prospects for hotel REITs.Mixed-Use Developments Mixed-use developments have gained immense popularity in recent years. Such developments lower the distance between housing, workplaces, retail businesses, and other amenities and destinations. Hence, such developments enable companies to grab the attention of people who prefer to live, work and play in the same area — a trend that drove development in several other cities in the United States. In recent years, retail REITs like Regency Centers Corp. (REG  -  Free Report) and Federal Realty Investment Trust (FRT  -  Free Report) also directed their investments toward such projects.Healthcare REITsDemand for healthcare real estate is expected to increase considerably on favorable demographics. This is because the senior citizen population is growing at a faster rate than other adults, calling for a greater healthcare needs. Along with an aging population and cost containment, less expensive delivery settings and new technologies, demand for medical office buildings, outpatient facilities as well as urgent-care facilities is growing.Moreover, university-based life science real estate has grabbed attention. In fact, increasing longevity of the aging U.S. population, along with biopharma drug development growth opportunities, have promoted institutional life science and medical-market fundamentals. Further, long-lease terms and top-rated, institutional quality tenants assure steady growth in cash flows for health care landlords.Stocks to Add to Your PortfolioSpecific REITs that we prefer include Chatham Lodging Trust (CLDT  -  Free Report), New Residential Investment Corp.

46,FRT,"GGP Inc. (GGP  -  Free Report) enjoys a portfolio of high-quality retail properties across attractive locations in the United States. Further, its tenant roster includes a number of reputed names. GGP also focuses on omni-channel retailing and other initiatives which are encouraging. Nevertheless, declining traffic at malls, store closures and bankruptcies have emerged as a pressing concern for GGP as the trend is curtailing demand for the retail real estate space.Though the company is making efforts to counter the pressure through various initiatives, the implementation of such measures requires a decent upfront cost and will likely limit any robust growth in profit margins in the near term.In February, the retail REIT, GGP reported fourth-quarter 2017 funds from operations (FFO) per share of 48 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a cent. The figure was also higher than the prior-year quarter tally of 43 cents. Results indicated growth in same-store net operating income of 1.3% from the prior-year period.Notably, retailers are continuously evolving and in order to maximize revenues, they are using brick-and-mortar presence and internet together. Amid this, GGP is focusing on omni-channel retailing as it generates higher sales. Since early 2011, the company invested around $2.86 billion, improving its centers.  It is providing tenants with access to retail, dining and entertainment hubs in some of the best trade areas in the United States.Such moves are strategic fits as they boost the shopping experience and enhance sales volume at tenant stores, consequently raising demand for the company’s assets. Furthermore, GGP has been making efforts to add residential units to its retail centers in order to densify its retail centers. Such developments lower the distance between housing and retail destinations while steering a dependable traffic.Recently, as per a Reuters report, asset manager, Brookfield Property Partners made a revised acquisition offer to GGP. Per people familiar with the matter, the revised offer boasts of an elevated cash component. Notably, in November 2017, Brookfield offered $14.8 billion or $23 per share in a cash-and-stock offer to acquire the remaining 66% stake in GGP. However, GGP’s special board committee rejected the offer. The negotiations between the companies are ongoing and the exact value of the new offer is not known. The special board committee has yet to accept the offer.However, the U.S. retail real estate market has been plagued with issues like downsizing and bankruptcies of retailers in recent times. This is because mall traffic continues to suffer amid a rapid shift in customers’ shopping preferences and patterns with online purchases growing by leaps and bounds.This has emerged as a pressing concern for retail REITs including Simon Property Group, Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report), The Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report), Federal Realty Investment Trust (FRT  -  Free Report), GGP and others as the trend is curtailing demand for the retail real estate space considerably and curbing the landlord’s pricing power and occupancy level of properties. Moreover, such a choppy environment has led tenants to demand substantial lease concessions but mall landlords are finding these unjustified.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock outperformed its industry in the past six months.

49,FRT,"Federal Realty Investment Trust (FRT  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter and 2017 results after the market closes on Feb 13. Both its revenues and funds from operations (FFO) are anticipated to experience year-over-year growth.Last quarter, this retail real estate investment trust (REIT) delivered a positive surprise of 2% with respect to FFO per share. Results indicated growth in revenues and FFO on a year-over-year basis.The company has a decent surprise history having surpassed estimates in all the trailing four quarters. This resulted in an average positive surprise of 1.55%. The graph below depicts the surprise history of the company:Federal Realty Investment Trust Price and EPS Surprise Federal Realty Investment Trust Price and EPS Surprise | Federal Realty Investment Trust QuoteHowever, Federal Realty’s shares have descended 16.1% in the past six months, against the industry’s decline of 6.1%.Let’s see how things have shaped up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderFederal Realty has been taking advantage of the redevelopment opportunities. Particularly, amid a fast-evolving retail environment, the company is making strategic efforts to reposition, redevelop and re-merchandise its portfolio.These efforts will not only help the company counter competition from e-retailers but will also enable it to post decent operating results in the to-be-reported quarter.Subsequently, minimum rents from the retail and commercial segment will likely record year-over-year growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $147 million indicates an encouraging growth of 4.6% as compared to the year-ago quarter. Furthermore, total rental income is projected to be $214 million, an increase of 6.5% from the prior-year tally.However, rising consumer purchases through the Internet has emerged as a pressing concern for this REIT. These have made retailers reconsider their footprints and eventually opt for store closures. Also, retailers, not able to cope with competition, have been filing bankruptcies.Accordingly, percentage rents, which indicate additional rent based on the level of sales achieved by the tenant, are predicted to witness a considerable decline due to the tepid retail environment. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.34 million reflects a 7.4% rise as compared to the prior-year quarter.Federal Realty’s activities during the quarter could not gain adequate analyst confidence. Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Q4 FFO has edged down marginally to $1.47 in two months’ time. However, it indicates a rise of 1.4% year-over-year.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $218.7 million, indicating a year-over-year improvement of 7.1%.For full-year 2017, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues stands at $851.5 million, reflecting a year-over-year rise of 6.2%. The consensus estimate for FFO per share is $5.91, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 4.6%. Management expects FFO per share in the range of $5.89-$5.92.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Federal Realty will likely beat on earnings this season. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

This is because the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate both are pegged at $1.47.Zacks Rank: Federal Realty’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP.

50,FRT,"Simon Property Group, Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report) is putting in every effort to enhance the value of its assets. Most recently, the company announced the premier mixed-use development at Atlanta's Phipps Plaza. The transformative redevelopment is marked by the arrival of a new Nobu Hotel and Nobu Atlanta Restaurant. Notably, Nobu Hotels is a notable name among global luxury brands.Other features of this portfolio revamp plan include a 90,000-square-foot Life Time Athletic healthy living and entertainment destination, as well as a 12-story Class A office building with a three-story lower level parking garage. These will be added to Phipps Plaza’s current footprint. The construction work is slated to commence in 2018, while the opening will take place in phases, starting in spring 2020.Positioned at the center of the Buckhead district and conveniently connected to the Midtown and Downtown Atlanta regions, Phipps Plaza will continue to be anchored by Nordstrom Inc. (JWN  -  Free Report) and Saks Fifth Avenue stores.At a time when mall traffic has been dwindling amid a rapid change in shopping patterns, with online shopping taking precedence over in-store purchase, these transformative efforts of Simon at Phipps Plaza are likely to boost the overall footfall.In fact, in recent years Simon Property has already made efforts to transform Phipps Plaza by adding residential units, hospitality components, as well as food and dining options. This included adding The AC Hotel Atlanta Buckhead, with 166 guest rooms and suites, as well as The Domain comprising 319 mid-rise, urban-style luxury residences.Amid the ongoing changes in consumer behavior, retail REITs are avoiding heavy dependence on apparel and accessories, and transforming their boring shopping hubs into swanky entertainment zones. These companies are expanding dining options, opening up movie theaters and offering recreational facilities. Eventually, such measures are likely to push up traffic.Moreover, the shift toward mixed-use development by Simon Property for Phipps Plaza is a strategic fit. In fact, mixed-use developments too have gained popularity for solid neighborhood character, greater housing variety and density.Such developments lower the distance between housing, workplaces, retail businesses, and other amenities and destinations. Hence, these developments enable companies to grab the attention of people who prefer to live, work and play in the same area — a trend that drove development in several other cities in the United States. In recent years, retail REITs like Regency Centers Corp. (REG  -  Free Report) and Federal Realty Investment Trust (FRT  -  Free Report) also directed their investments toward such projects.Simon Property currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The company’s portfolio of premium retail assets – mainly situated in the major coastal markets from Washington, D.C. to Boston, San Francisco and Los Angeles – along with a diverse tenant base, positions it well for decent growth.Nevertheless, mall traffic continues to dwindle amid a rapid shift in customers’ shopping preferences, with non-store sales rising significantly.

52,FRT,"Retail REIT The Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report) delivered fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted funds from operations (FFO) per share of $1.13, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a cent. Results reflect decline in occupancy in the quarter. Moreover, revenues slipped from the prior-year period as well.Including the $14.5-million re-valuation reduction of a deferred tax asset because of the lower federal corporate income tax rates, FFO per share for the quarter came in at $1.03 compared with $1.17 in the prior-year period.The company posted revenues of $256.7 million for the fourth quarter, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $234.4 million. However, the figure came in 5.6% lower than the prior-year quarter figure.For full-year 2017, FFO per share came in at $3.83, down 6.1% from the year-ago tally of $4.08. The company also experienced a 4.6% year-over-year decline in revenues to nearly $993.7 million.Quarter in DetailAs of Dec 31, 2017, mall portfolio occupancy contracted 40 basis points (bps) year over year to 95.0%. Mall tenant annual sales increased 4.8% year over year to $660 per square feet. Re-leasing spreads for the year ended Dec 31, 2017, increased 15.2%.

Currently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share is pegged at $4.07.Our ViewpointDwindling footfall amid shift of consumers toward online channels, store closures and bankruptcy of retailers are anticipated to adversely affect the company’s performance in the near term. While Macerich has been striving to counter the pressure through efforts to support omni-channel retailing and portfolio revamp, implementation of such measures requires a decent upfront cost and therefore, might limit any robust growth in profit margins in the near term. Furthermore, interest rate hikes and portfolio concentration remain concerns for the company.Currently, Macerich has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

53,FRT,"The overall performance of the REIT industry in 2017 has not been awe-inspiring amid macroeconomic uncertainty in the nation and restrained trading activity. However, a number of asset categories have stood out and generated solid returns, at times even above the broader market.Moreover, due to the presence of favorable market conditions, these REITs have enough scope to excel in the future. This reinstalls our confidence and encourages us to focus on individual market dynamics that play a crucial role in determining the performance of REITs.Furthermore, instead of worrying over the December rate hike, one needs to shift attention to the better outlook provided by the Fed this time, in terms of GDP growth for 2018, a positive revision in projected inflation and expectations of a solid job market. This is because REIT business usually buoys up on a stepped-up economy and job scenario.Also, the growing importance of the industry over the years is quite evident. It has carved a niche for itself through the creation of the exclusive headline sector for real estate under the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) in 2016.Further, investors' faith in this sector and their willingness to pour money into it is increasing, which is apparent when we look at the industry’s capacity to raise capital from the market.Amid all this, the time is now apt to explore the industry and scoop up big gains.Technology Wave to Drive Demand for Data Center, Cell Tower, Industrial REITsTechnological evolution is changing the dynamics of the real estate market and substantially driving up demand at a number of asset categories. For example, the e-commerce boom has hugely affected retailers’ business model, causing a decline in mall traffic and keeping retail REITs on tenterhooks.On the other hand, demand for another set of REITs ticks up right from the time one uses smartphones, tablets or computers for a purchase. This is because as demand is placed, the order is transmitted through cell towers and processed at data centers. Finally, the order is fulfilled through the industrial/logistics facilities and delivered at the doorstep.Now, REITs happen to own many of these cell towers, data centers and logistics facilities. Therefore, without the offering of this critical infrastructure, the e-commerce value chain simply cannot sustain.Along with making purchases online, an increasing number of people are consuming digital content. Going by numbers, per a forecast from Cisco, from 2016 to 2021, global Internet video traffic and mobile data traffic are estimated to witness a CAGR of 31% and 46%, respectively.The estimated growth rate for the markets of artificial intelligence, Internet of Things, autonomous vehicle and virtual/augmented reality are also anticipated to remain robust over the next five to eight years. Therefore, along with an improved outlook for economic growth, all these only make us hugely optimistic about extensive growth in demand for space at cell tower and data-center REITs.Further, amid economic expansion, e-commerce development and heightened urbanization, companies are shifting their strategy to services like same-day delivery and other options. This is propelling demand for distribution facilities near population centers, which not only help in lowering delivery time but also reduce cost of delivery.In fact, according to a report from Prologis Inc. (PLD  -  Free Report), for a given level of revenues, online retailers require three times the distribution center space compared with traditional retailers. As such, demand from the e-commerce sector has been escalating and per a report by Jones Lang LaSalle Inc. (JLL  -  Free Report), in third-quarter 2017, this sector accounted for nearly 25% of total U.S. leasing demand compared with 14.7% in the previous year.This is offering significant impetus for growth to industrial REITs. Further, a healthy manufacturing environment, a recovering economy and job market gains are likely to drive demand from other sectors besides e-commerce. So shareholders of such REITs have sufficient reasons to rejoice.Consumer Preferences, Omni-Channel Retailing to Redesign Retail REIT MarketOver the past several quarters, several issues have cropped up in the retail REIT market with consumers preferring online platforms over in-store purchases, resulting in store closures and bankruptcies. These have affected the share price of several major retail REITs in the past year.However, the month of November saw increased shareholder activity in the retail real estate market triggered by Brookfield Property Partners' $15-billion takeover offer for GGP Inc. (GGP  -  Free Report). Further, solid earnings and leasing metrics indicate that the sector still has inherent strength.In fact, retail REITs are putting in every effort to boost productivity of malls, by trying to grab attention from new and productive tenants, and disposing the non-productive ones. Amid the ongoing changes in consumer behavior, retail REITs have been avoiding heavy dependence on apparel and accessories. Rather, these companies are expanding dining options, opening movie theaters and offering recreational facilities. Eventually, such strategic measures are likely to boost traffic.Moreover, retail REITs are intending to expand their portfolio of shops, which comprise service-based industries such as saloons and spas, personal fitness, and medical practices. Such properties enjoy frequent customer traffic, are Internet-resistant, and drive dependable traffic as a result.Residential REITs to Experience Stable Rent Growth Despite Supply IssuesThe U.S. apartment market reported stable rent growth, while occupancy remained healthy in recent quarters. In fact, per a study by the real estate technology and analytics firm, RealPage, Inc. (RP  -  Free Report). U.S. apartment rents increased at a modest rate of 2.5% in 2017. Further, national apartment occupancy came in at 95.1% at the end of fourth-quarter 2017, remaining unchanged from the prior year.Notably, job formation and checked move-outs for buying homes have acted as catalysts. Also, construction labor shortages and escalating costs have somewhat helped the industry to witness comparatively lesser supply than anticipated earlier.Further, with apartment starts displaying a slowdown in 2017, supply issues are likely to abate to quite an extent toward the end of 2018 and in 2019. In addition, there is solid chance of pent-up demand as the number of doubled-up households remains high.Moreover, with a significant salary differential between college graduates and high-school graduates, college enrolment is set to increase. This will likely drive demand for residential units that are leased by student housing REITs. Also, there is pent-up demand for new, purpose-built student housing properties that have better amenities than old, outdated housing. Further, supply remains manageable.Apart from these, student housing REITs have solid opportunities to excel in the coming years as demand is emanating for on-campus developments from universities that are facing state budget cuts and low funds, and are incapable of developing or renovating the aging housing properties. And on-campus housing usually enjoys full occupancy.Economic Expansion and Job Growth Provide Growth Impetus to Office, Hotel REITs  With economic improvement and recovery in the job market, healthy growth in demand for office spaces is expected to continue. This is because, as the economy revives, business grows. So corporate sectors seek expansion and rent more space to accommodate increased workforce.While higher construction with increased completions might moderate the pace of growth in the primary markets, secondary markets are likely to excel with increased population and growth in employment.In case of hotel REITs too, an improving economy, growth in employment and rise in wages are likely to drive demand for hotels. Moreover, with a slowdown in supply growth, fundamentals are expected to be in favor of the hotel landlords.Mixed-Use Developments Gains PopularityMixed-use developments have also gained in popularity in recent years. Such developments lower the distance between housing, workplaces, retail businesses, and other amenities and destinations. Hence, such developments enable companies to grab the attention of people who prefer to live, work and play in the same area — a trend that drove development in several other cities in the U.S. In recent years, retail REITs like Regency Centers Corp. (REG  -  Free Report) and Federal Realty Investment Trust (FRT  -  Free Report) also directed their investments toward such projects.Aging Population to Drive Demand for Healthcare REITsDemand for healthcare real estate is expected to increase considerably on favorable demographics. This is because the senior citizen population is growing at a faster rate than other adults calling for a greater healthcare needs. Along with an aging population and cost containment, less expensive delivery settings and new technologies, demand for medical office buildings as well as urgent-care facilities is growing.Moreover, university-based life science real estate has grabbed attention and health care REITs are making decent investments in this segment. Such investments help to capitalize on growing health-care-driven research and development, supported by top-tier research universities.Notably, increasing longevity of the aging U.S. population, along with biopharma drug development growth opportunities, have promoted institutional life science and medical-market fundamentals. Further, long-lease terms and top-rated, institutional quality tenants assure steady growth in cash flows for health care landlords.Besides, the market for seniors’ housing and healthcare real estate is large and fragmented, offering huge scope of consolidation. This provides solid opportunity to the healthcare REITs.Stocks to Add to Your PortfolioSpecific REITs that we prefer include Ashford Hospitality Prime, Inc. AHP, LTC Properties Inc.

54,FRT,"The end of Cyber Monday, a day which witnesses the single largest volume of online purchases, is possibly a good time to take stock of e-commerce’s fortunes. Fresh estimates from Adobe Systems Inc. (ADBE) indicate that expenditure via the e-commerce route registered a near 17% increase to hit $6.6 billion this Cyber Monday.In fact, the holiday season as a whole will see online expenditure touch nearly $107 billion, more than 11% of total retail holiday sales. While this is great news for the likes of Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN), brick and mortar retailers are an embattled lot. But the fallout of the e-commerce assault isn’t limited to this segment alone. Retail REITs are also increasingly feeling the heat.General Growth Property’s DilemmaThe problems faced by U.S. retail REITs are best illustrated by the case of GGP, Inc. (GGP  -  Free Report). On Nov 11, GGP received a $15 billion offer from Brookfield Property Partners, aimed at buying the shares it still doesn’t in this major mall owner.Reportedly, GGP had already been in talks with Brookfield about going private. But Brookfield offered to pay only $23 per share, only marginally higher than Nov 10’s closing price of $22.20 in a cash and equity deal.  This case serves to illustrate how acute the situation seems for retail REITs. This Chicago-based REIT is believed to be well above its peers in terms of the quality of its real estate portfolio. Most of its malls are considered to be “Class A” level, those which generate the highest level of sales per square foot.Has E-commerce Caused Retail Overcapacity?But GGP is already facing a large number of problems, store closures and retail bankruptcies to name a few, all of which are a fallout of the switch to online purchases. Share prices of several major retail REITs are down year to date. This includes the likes of Simon Property Group (SPG  -  Free Report), Federal Realty Investment Trust (FRT  -  Free Report) and Kimco Realty Corporation (KIM  -  Free Report) which have lost 12%, 8% and 27.7% over the last one year.And yet, most of these REITs enjoy occupancy levels of 95%, according to most industry estimates. This means that demand from multiple sources remains high. In fact, year to date leasing volumes for Kimco Realty are at a record high, a fact which serves to illustrate the sector’s inherent strength. Rental prices and leasing volumes continue to remain high and earnings have been mostly promising.Is Diversification the Way Forward?Coming back to the GGP story, a deal with Brookfield would provide the mall owner with an opportunity to diversify across various segments of the REIT industry. For instance, it could follow a mixed usage strategy, putting office space and apartments into several of its properties. This is because Brookfield itself holds a more diversified real estate portfolio, including retail stores, offices and multifamily housing.This is likely a situation which retail REITs across the board are facing. As brick and mortar retailers increasingly come under fire, retail REITs are having to make rapid changes, sometimes only in order to combat falling share prices. Though stock fundamentals continue to look solid, activist investors are demanding rapid changes in the face of the e-commerce boom.Price Declines Likely OverdoneThere is no denying that the retail REIT segment is facing a number of challenges. Among them is increased competition, both at malls and at shopping centers anchored by groceries. This could lead to a significant decline in margins for retailers who would in term pay lower levels of rent.REITs are suffering because it is difficult to predict the outcome of the so called retail apocalypse. But strong earnings and leasing volumes indicate that the extent to which prices of retail REIT stocks have declined is difficult to justify.2 Retail REIT ChoicesDespite the troubles plaguing the industry currently, retail REITs remain solid prospects. Strong fundamentals imply that price declines are overdone. This is why investing in select retail REITs remains a good option.A favorable EV/EBITDA ratio is desirable for any REIT given the large levels of debt which they utilize to funds their operations. Both of our picks have EV/EBITDA levels which are lower than the industry average of 23.3. Additionally, each of them has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

57,FRT,"Federal Realty Investment Trust (FRT  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter 2017 results after the market closes on Nov 1. Both its revenues and funds from operations (FFO) are anticipated to experience solid year-over-year growth.Last quarter, this retail real estate investment trust (REIT) delivered a positive surprise of 2.1% with respect to FFO per share. Results indicated growth in revenues and same-center property operating income.The company has a decent surprise history. Over the trailing four quarters, it surpassed estimates in three occasions and missed in the other. This resulted in an average positive surprise of 0.9%. The graph below depicts the surprise history of the company:Federal Realty Investment Trust Price and EPS Surprise  Federal Realty Investment Trust Price and EPS Surprise | Federal Realty Investment Trust QuoteNote: All EPS numbers presented in this write-up represent funds from operations (FFO) per share.However, Federal Realty’s shares have descended 14.5% year to date, against the industry’s decline of 8.9%.Let’s see how things have shaped up for this announcement.Factors to Consider Federal Realty has been taking advantage of the redevelopment opportunities. Particularly, amid a fast evolving retail environment, the company is making strategic efforts to reposition, redevelop and re-merchandise its portfolio.   These efforts will not only help the company counter competition from e-retailers but will also enable it to post decent operating results in the to-be-reported quarter. Subsequently, minimum rents from the retail and commercial segment will likely record year-over-year growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $148 million indicates encouraging growth of 8% as compared to the year-ago quarter. Furthermore, total rental income is projected to be $209 million, a marginal rise from the prior-quarter tally of $204 million.However, rising consumer purchases through the Internet has emerged as a pressing concern for this REIT. These have made retailers reconsider their footprint and eventually opt for store closures. Also, retailers not able to cope with competition have been filing bankruptcies.Accordingly, percentage rents, which indicate additional rent based on the level of sales achieved by the tenant, are predicted to witness a considerable decline due to the tepid retail environment. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.44 million reflects a 5.2% dip as compared to the prior-year quarter.Prior to the third-quarter earnings release, there is lack of any solid catalyst for becoming optimistic about the company’s business activities and prospects. As such, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of FFO per share for the third quarter edged down 0.7% to $1.47 over the past two months.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Federal Realty will likely beat on earnings this season. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, that is not the case here as you will see below.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Federal Realty is -0.92%.Zacks Rank: Federal Realty’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP.

The company also announced a hike in quarterly dividend.During the quarter, the company posted revenues of $1.4 billion, which nearly came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.

The new dividend will be paid on Nov 30 to stockholders of record on Nov 16, 2017.Our ViewpointWe are encouraged with the better-than-expected performance of Simon Property.

60,FRT,"Ventas, Inc. (VTR  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter 2017 normalized funds from operations (FFO) of $1.04 per share, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The figure also came in a penny higher than the year-ago quarter tally. Results reflect improved property performance and accretive investments.Further, the company posted revenues of $895.5 million which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $869.4 million. The figure compared favorably with the year-ago number of $867.1 million.For the third quarter, same-store cash net operating income (NOI) growth for total portfolio (1,045 assets) climbed 2.1% year over year. Segment wise, same-store cash NOI for the triple net leased portfolio grew 3.8%, seniors housing operating portfolio inched up 0.6% and medical office building portfolio rose 1.5%.Quarter in DetailDuring the third quarter, Ventas funded investments of around $80 million. This included $67 million of funding for its share of development and redevelopment projects for projects presently in progress.Furthermore, the company disposed properties and obtained final repayments on loans receivable for proceeds of $650 million.LiquidityAt present, the company enjoys liquidity with $2.9 billion of available borrowing capacity and $100 million of cash on hand.2017 OutlookVentas updated its outlook and estimates 2017 normalized FFO per share in the range of $4.13-$4.16. The mid-point of the guidance remained unchanged from the prior guidance as the Kindred skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) sale offsets improved property performance. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at $4.17. The company anticipates same-store cash NOI growth of 2-2.5% in 2017.Our TakeWe are encouraged with the in-line performance of Ventas in the third quarter. We believe the company’s adequate size and scale would help it capitalize on opportunities such as increasing healthcare spending and aging population.Also, university-based life science real estate is a new zone of investment which has grabbed attention and Ventas has already committed substantial amount to this segment.  The company acquired a 262,000-square-foot class-A life science building, which is currently 82% occupied. Such investments will likely offer scope to capitalize on growing health-care-driven research and development.In addition to this, sale of the SNFs enabled the company to realize around $570 million in sale proceeds. Also, the transaction lowered the company’s exposure to this particular healthcare real estate category which is becoming more susceptible to top-line pressure due to the change in medical billing procedure.However, hike in interest rate is a concern for the company, considering its substantial exposure to long-term leased assets.Currently, Ventas carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

61,FRT,"The REIT industry’s performance has long being ruled by movements in interest rates, particularly treasury yields. But with fundamentals of the underlying assets playing as important a role in determining REITs’ price performance, demand-supply dynamics and tenant performance are commanding attention.In fact, a number of asset categories are displaying strength with the economy and the job market showing signs of recovery. The REITs catering to these are generating solid returns, at times even above the broader market.Moreover, the growing importance of the REIT industry over the years is quite evident and the creation of the exclusive headline sector for real estate under the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) last year raised expectations of drawing in billions and pushing up valuations over time.Also, the U.S. REIT market has continued to expand with the FTSE NAREIT All REITs Index, comprising 227 REITs with a combined equity market capitalization of $1.126 trillion at the end of August 2017. This is ahead of 219 REITs and $972 billion in equity market capitalization at the end of April 2016.Further, investors' faith in this sector and their willingness to pour money into it is increasing. This is apparent when we look at the industry’s capacity to raise capital from the market. In fact, in the first eight months of 2017, REITs raised $62.8 billion of capital that was well ahead of the $52.3 billion generated in the comparable period prior year.Therefore, the time is now apt to explore the industry in depth and scoop up big gains.Data Center REITsGrowth in cloud computing, Internet of Things and big data, and an increasing number of companies opting for third-party IT infrastructure are driving demand for data center REITs. In fact, demand is outpacing supply in top-tier data center markets and despite enjoying high occupancy, these markets are absorbing new construction at a faster pace.Additionally, according to a Cisco forecast, global “data center-to-data center” IP traffic is expected to witness a compound annual growth rate of 32% over the 2015-2020 period. Further, per Gartner reports, worldwide IT spending growth is projected to increase 3.3%, while worldwide server shipments are expected to rise 4.0% in 2017. This, along with improved outlook for economic growth, is anticipated to drive demand for data centers. In fact, this REIT segment pulled in capital and scored well on the return book through August 2017, registering total returns of 31.8%.Industrial REITIn the industrial real estate market, demand for space has been high for several quarters. Going by numbers, per a study by the commercial real estate services’ firm – CBRE Group Inc. CBG – the overall U.S. industrial real estate market remained upbeat in the second quarter, with the industrial availability rate declining 10 basis points to 7.8%.This marked not only the market’s 27th decline in the past 28 quarters, but also the lowest level since first-quarter 2001. Obviously, a recovering economy and job market gains aided this improvement, but the e-commerce boom and a healthy manufacturing environment were the chief drivers. Also, lower-than-expected completion of construction kept supply numbers at check.Particularly, amid economic expansion, e-commerce development and heightened urbanization, companies are shifting their strategy toward services like same-day delivery and other options, propelling demand for warehouse distribution facilities. Also, according to a report from Prologis Inc. (PLD  -  Free Report), for a given level of revenues, online retailers require three times the distribution center space compared with traditional retailers. This is creating scope for industrial REITs like Prologis, DCT Industrial Trust Inc. (DCT  -  Free Report) and Liberty Property Trust (LPT  -  Free Report) to prosper.Office REITsIn addition, the U.S. office vacancy rate remained steady at 13% in the second quarter amid balanced demand-supply, according to a report from CBRE Group. In around half of the U.S. office markets, vacancy recorded a decline and the national office vacancy rate is hovering close to its post-recession low.Additionally, corporate profits are up and business confidence has recovered. Going forward, with economic improvement and recovery in the job market, demand for office space is expected to shoot up.Residential REITsFurther, defying concerns about supply in the market, the residential real estate market is back with a bang driven by robust demand. Per a study by the real estate technology and analytics firm, RealPage, Inc. (RP  -  Free Report), the second-quarter demand level of 175,645 apartments across the nation marked one-third increase from the level witnessed a year ago. This helped occupancy to remain high at 95.0% as of mid-year and led to stabilization in the annual pace of rent growth, which came in at 3.6%, close to 3.7% growth experienced in the first quarter.Notably, job formation and checked move-outs for buying homes acted as catalysts. Also, construction labor shortages have somewhat helped the industry to witness comparatively lesser supply through the first eight months of the year than anticipated earlier.Moreover, with a higher education earnings gap – millennials with a high school diploma are earning just 62% of what college graduates are making – college enrollment is set to increase and this would drive demand for residential units that student housing REITs lease. Also, there is pent-up demand for new, purpose-built student housing properties that have better amenities than old, outdated housing.Further, student housing REITs have decent opportunities to excel in the coming years as demand is emanating for on-campus developments from universities that are facing state budget cuts and low funds, and are incapable of developing or renovating their aging housing properties. And on-campus housing usually enjoys full occupancy.Healthcare REITsIn the healthcare asset category too, with the aging population and healthcare providers opting for cost containment, less expensive delivery settings and new technologies, demand for medical office buildings as well as urgent-care facilities is on the rise.Per a CBRE Group report, for the past seven years absorption of medical office space has surpassed new supply. This helped the segment’s national vacancy rate to fall to 8% as of first quarter 2017. Also, high demand for this asset category has led to an increase in transaction volume in the segment that touched around $10 billion for the year ending first-quarter 2017, per the report.In addition, university-based life science real estate is a new zone of investment, which has grabbed attention and health care REITs are making decent investments in this segment. Such investments help to capitalize on growing health-care-driven research and development, supported by top-tier research universities.Increasing longevity of the aging U.S. population, along with biopharma drug development growth opportunities, have promoted institutional life science and medical-market fundamentals. Further, long-lease terms and top-rated, institutional quality tenants assure steady growth in cash flows for health care landlords.Retail REITAdmittedly, shrinking mall traffic and store closures amid aggressive growth in online sales have kept retail REITs on tenterhooks. In addition, tenants are demanding substantial lease concessions owing to a choppy retail market scenario. Nonetheless, retail REITs are countering this dreary situation and putting in every effort to boost productivity of malls, by trying to grab attention from new and productive tenants and disposing the non-productive ones.Amid the ongoing changes in consumer behavior, retail REITs are avoiding heavy dependence on apparel and accessories and transforming their boring shopping hubs into swanky entertainment zones. They are expanding dining options, opening up movie theaters and offering recreational facilities. Eventually, such measures are likely to push up traffic.Retail REITs also prefer expansion of shops, which comprise service-based industries such as saloons and spas, personal fitness, and medical practices. Such properties enjoy frequent customer traffic, are Internet-resistant, and therefore drive dependable traffic.Mixed-Use DevelopmentsMixed-use developments too have gained popularity for their solid neighborhood character, greater housing variety and density. Such developments lower the distance between housing, workplaces, retail businesses, and other amenities and destinations. Hence, such developments enable companies to grab the attention of people who prefer to live, work and play in the same area — a trend that drove development in several other cities in the U.S.To explore these positives of mixed-use developments, both residential REITs like AvalonBay Communities Inc. (AVB  -  Free Report) and retail REITs like Regency Centers Corp. (REG  -  Free Report) and Federal Realty Investment Trust (FRT  -  Free Report) have directed their investments toward such projects in recent years.Stocks to Add to Your PortfolioSpecific REITs that we prefer include UMH Properties, Inc.

63,FRT,"Federal Realty Investment Trust (FRT  -  Free Report) is making diligent efforts to sell its non-core assets and redeploy the proceeds toward strategic growth schemes. Recently, the company announced that it has sold 150 Post Street — an office and retail property spanning 105,000 square feet of space — for $69.3 million.Federal Realty took advantage of the competitive investment sales market in the San Francisco area and shed its investment in the seven-story property. The company is actively looking for further opportunities to shed its non-core assets and has already made disposals totaling $123 million, year to date.Federal Realty has been selling its non-strategic assets to fund acquisitions in premium markets, which, in turn, generates income growth and creates long-term value. This will enable company achieve balanced growth without straining its capital resources and balance sheet.In sync with such efforts, recently, Federal Realty announced the closing of a new joint venture with Los Angeles-based owner and developer of premier retail properties — Primestor Development Inc. The company has around 90% stake in the venture.Notably, this venture is seeded with a full interest in five dominant community shopping centers, in addition to one center under redevelopment and a 25% minority stake in a seventh shopping center. Together, these seven properties comprise more than 1.3 million square feet of space on 114 acres of urban land. Federal Realty’s investment in the venture is around $345 million, which includes a $20-million commitment to finish redevelopment of one of the centers.However, similar to other retail REITs, Federal Realty has been facing stiff competition from online retailing platforms. With online purchases taking precedence, mall traffic continues to be affected, leading to an increasing number of retailers joining the dot-com bandwagon.. This has compelled the existing retailers to reconsider their footprint and eventually opt for store closures.These challenges in the retail real estate market are expected to have an adverse impact on the company’s shares which have underperformed its industry, year to date. During this period, shares of the company have lost 10.7% of its value, while the industry suffered a decline of 5.8%.Federal Realty currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked stocks in the REIT space include American Asset Trust (AAT  -  Free Report), Getty Realty Corporation (GTY  -  Free Report) and Communications Sales & Leasing, Inc.

64,FRT,"Federal Realty Investment Trust (FRT  -  Free Report), similar to other retail real estate investment trusts (REIT), has been facing low demand for its real estate amid a rising trend in online purchases. Hence the company has been capitalizing on expansion opportunities in premium markets to support its operating performance.Specifically, Federal Realty has been actively investing in assets, which generates income growth and creates long-term value. Also, the company sells its non-core assets and redeploys the proceeds toward strategic growth schemes to facilitate this. It has been bolstering its bottom line through expansion, renovation and re-tenanting efforts.In fact, on Aug 3, Federal Realty announced the closing of a new joint venture with Los Angeles-based owner and developer of premier retail properties — Primestor Development Inc. The venture is seeded with a full interest in five dominant community shopping centers, in addition to one center under redevelopment, as well as a 25% minority stake in a seventh shopping center. The company has around 90% stake in the venture.In order to cushion itself from short-term market swings, Federal Realty signs long-term leases with annual bumps. On a comparable-space basis (spaces for which a former tenant was there), the company leased 397,555 square feet of space, at an average cash-basis contractual rent escalation of 13%. Rent increases (on a straight-line basis) for comparable retail space averaged 27% for second-quarter 2017. In addition, the upscale geographic location of the company’s properties and the diversified tenant base of retailers help it enjoy a stable source of rental revenues.Amid a fast evolving retail environment, the company has been making diligent efforts to reposition, redevelop and re-merchandise its portfolio. This includes an upgradation of its tenant mix. While such efforts are a strategic fit for the long term, the short-term adverse impact on earnings cannot be bypassed.Although Federal Realty’s improving development and redevelopment pipeline is encouraging for its future growth, it increases the company’s operational risks by exposing it to escalating construction costs, entitlement delays and lease-up risks.Shares of Federal Realty have underperformed its industry year to date, declining 9.7% compared with the industry’s plunge of 5.6%.
