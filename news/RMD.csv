0,RMD,"Tesla (TSLA) helped push the Nasdaq composite into higher ground after a fantastic start to the new year last week. Meanwhile, a top Bitcoin play cut initial losses and continues to begin what may eventually become a new base pattern.XTesla scored its biggest single-session gain in months, rising 19.22, or more than 6%, to 335.80 in volume running more than 50% higher than normal. The rebound was strong enough to hoist the electric vehicle innovator back above two important technical levels: the 50- day moving average (near 317) and the still-rising long-term 200-day moving average (currently at 332).At 3:45 p.m. ET, the Nasdaq composite gained roughly 0.3% while the S&P 500 was up less than 0.2%. Last week the Nasdaq powered 3.4% higher for the week, its biggest weekly gain since a 3.8% surge during the week of the pivotal U.S. elections in November 2016.The Dow Jones industrial average inched barely higher. Volume is running virtually unchanged vs. the same time on Friday on both exchanges.The S&P SmallCap 600 kept apace, rising nearly 0.2%.Despite a strong gain for Tesla, it should not be bought now if you are following IBD's system for selecting and buying stocks 100%. The simple reason: It has yet to truly break out. The stock needs more time and work to fashion the right side of an emerging new base.Other stocks that broke out today include trucking play Forward Air (FWRD) (cup with handle showing a 58.90 buy point), sleep disorders treatment specialist ResMed (RMD) (flat base, 87.91 entry), fiber optics gear expert IPG Photonics (IPGP) (six-week cup, 248.33) and longtime Sector Leader Arista Networks (ANET) (245.75 in an odd shaped cup).Forward Air is part of the leading Transport-Truck group, which has been in the top 20 among 197 IBD industry groups for months in terms of six-month relative price performance. A strong leading stock market leader tends to be part of a top-performing industry group or sector.The Greenville, Tenn., firm has grown profits at a slow yet steady pace after a tiny dip in 2013. Earnings fell 5% in the fourth quarter of 2016, then grew 9%, 12% and 14% the next three quarters. The Street sees earnings lifting 7% to 62 cents a share for a full-year gain of 12% to $2.32 a share.2018 profit is seen rising another 13% to $2.62 a share.The Dow transportation average is leading the major indexes on Monday, rolling ahead 0.6%.Tesla has certainly grown into a big cap within the Automakers industry group. Yet with a market cap of $56 billion, it still isn't one of the largest companies on the Nasdaq. You can see the tickers of the 30-some largest companies by market value at the top of the Nasdaq chart on the large ""General Market Indicators"" page, accessible via the Market Trend section of Investors.com, or via The Big Picture.Tesla surged from its initial breakout near 40 in the first week of April 2013 as the company proved it can turn a profit. The stock galloped more than 625% to a high of 291.42 by September 2014, then jumped out of a new base on base pattern at 287.49 during the week ended April 7 last year.That breakout, essentially from a first-stage base given how long the stock took to digest its first huge advance, produced a solid return of 34.6% before Tesla peaked at 386.99 in June. Since then, the stock has been in basing mode.In September, Tesla attempted a new breakout past 370.10 in a somewhat wide and loose cup with handle. Wide and loose action is a clear flaw. You want to see controlled, relatively tight action as a stock declines significantly, bottoms out, then builds the right side of a new base.Given that in November, Tesla dropped below the low of 303.12 in the prior cup with handle, one could argue that the company is now forming a new first-stage base. Early-stage bases tend to have higher rates of success than late-stage ones.The company is forecast to loss $3 a share in the fourth quarter as it invests heavily in production capacity for the Model 3 entry level all-electric sedan and other new products.According to IBD Stock Checkup, the Palo Alto, Calif., firm gets an awful 36 Composite Rating on a scale of 1 to 99, but that mostly has to do with a tamped down EPS Rating of 22, caused by net losses in 11 of the past 12 quarters. However, the bright spot in Tesla's proprietary ratings can be found in its Accumulation/Distribution Rating, which is a positive B- on a grade scale of A (heavy institutional buying on net) to E (huge selling).The Accumulation/Distribution Rating tracks price-and-volume action over the past 13 weeks and serves as a good indicator when deciding which stocks to buy. In general, prefer those stocks with an Accumulation Grade of C+ or higher. Sometimes, a terrific winner will break out with a lowly Accumulation grade, caused by a few instances of sharp declines in steep turnover. In such situations, look closely at the daily chart of the stock; it may have bounced off the lows during a big sell-off, and that can be bullish.Also, the Stock Checkup shows the up/down volume ratio, which tracks price and volume over the past 50 sessions. If this ratio is 0.9 or higher, that can offset a poor Accumulation rating.Elsewhere in the stock market today, Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC), a huge winner in the fourth quarter of 2017, shaved losses to 5% at 2,220 in bone-dry turnover.The ETF is still in early basing mode. As noted in a prior Stock Market Today column, the Bitcoin play will need more time to build a new base and stage a breakout in the way that it did on Nov. 22, when it hauled out of a deep cup with handle at 985.10.RELATED:IBD's The Big Picture: What The Current Rally Says About This Bull RunStock Market Today: When To Buy This Hot Bitcoin ETFDo You Know How To Spot The Next Major Market Top?

1,RMD,"A good economy had the odd effect of sinking the S&P 500 on Monday, amid concerns about higher prices and borrowing costs as central banks remove the crutches intended to support rebounds in the U.S. and abroad.X But for the individual companies in the S&P 500 index, quarterly results — that more granular measure of customer attitudes and one of the main drivers of any stock — are surpassing Wall Street forecasts at a particularly high rate, one not seen since the previous decade.The above-the-bar results have been helped, as ever, by tech, health care and financials, including Amazon (AMZN), Intel (INTC) UnitedHealth (UNH) and Mastercard (MA). But companies like DowDuPont (DWDP) and Eastman Chemical (EMN) have led suppliers of materials higher. Industrials — minus long-ailing General Electric (GE) — also look solid after a long drought.Among the 322 S&P 500 companies that have reported quarterly results so far this earnings season, 78% topped Wall Street estimates, according to Thomson Reuters data released Thursday. Eighty percent beat estimates for revenue.That's the best rate of above-estimate earnings since the third quarter of 2009, according to Thompson Reuters. For sales, it's the best since at least 2002.S&P 500 earnings are currently on track to deliver a 14.7% gain, with revenue up a robust 8%. That assumes that the remaining S&P 500 companies due to report will meet estimates.Analysts also appear optimistic about first-quarter earnings, even as the prospect of higher wages touches off investor fears of inflation, and economic growth stirs anxieties that the Federal Reserve will be more aggressive in raising interest rates to keep that growth honest.IBD'S TAKE: After the Thursday, Feb. 1, market action — and before Friday's and Monday's market drubbings — IBD changed its market outlook to ""uptrend under pressure"" from ""confirmed uptrend,"" the equivalent of a green light turning yellow. Make sure to read The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market's prevailing trend, so you'll know when it makes sense to be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.Still, the global recovery has brought new demand for technology, energy and infrastructure. And a rebound in oil prices has boosted demand for equipment of all kinds, lifting industrials and, in turn, demand for the suppliers of chemical materials.In the stock market today, the S&P 500 index, Dow industrials and Nasdaq composite sold off yet again as Treasury yields hit multiyear highs. Stocks rallied strongly to start 2018 in part on expectations for strong, broad earnings growth.Within Thomson Reuters' Materials sector, which includes companies like DowDuPont and Eastman, 94% of companies have beat on earnings for the most recent quarter — the highest percentage of all 11 industry sectors measured by the firm. Eighty-one percent of companies in the Materials segment have beat on revenue.Even as the troubles deepen at General Electric, which has weighed on growth in the industrial sector as it tries to focus more on aviation, power and health care — that segment overall has remained solid. Seventy-four percent have beat on earnings, 81% on revenue.GE earnings per share slid 41% in the fourth quarter. It faces an SEC investigation, and one analyst said the company could be removed from the Dow.Within the technology sector, 85% of technology companies have beaten earnings estimates, led by companies like Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), CA (CA), Intel (INTC) and Xilinx (XLNX). Ninety percent beat on revenue, amid strong growth in semiconductors and semiconductor equipment.More tech companies are also bringing in bigger businesses as consumers.""You're seeing a transition from consumer-based to business-based, which is a big driver,"" Aurelio said. ""So you're seeing things like data-center growth.""In the Consumer-Discretionary category, where around three quarters of companies have produced above-the-bar results, Amazon (AMZN) last week turned out earnings far ahead of analyst expectations, helped by the GOP's new tax law and the broader migration to e-commerce and smart devices.""Our 2017 projections for Alexa were very optimistic, and we far exceeded them,"" CEO Jeff Bezos said in a statement at that time. ""We don't see positive surprises of this magnitude very often — expect us to double down.""Earnings from 89% of companies in Thomson Reuters' Health Care segment — which includes biotech, pharmaceuticals and health care services — came in above analyst views; 91% beat on revenue.UnitedHealth, the nation's largest health insurer, was among them. But the companies that surpassed earnings estimates by the widest margin were pharma distributor Cardinal Health (CAH), ResMed (RMD) and Align Technology (ALGN), the maker of Invisalign dental braces.Those earnings follow a 2017 that BMO analyst Matt Borsch (who follows managed care companies, hospitals and other care providers) characterized as mediocre, in terms of volume — or the number of inpatient admissions, outpatient procedures, and doctor and emergency-room visits.But more of that volume, he said, has been packed into the end of the fourth quarter, as more people meet their deductible on their high-deductible plans, which have become increasingly common.""When you have the high-deductible health plans, you generally have a pretty strong dynamic of people, on average, increasing their utilization significantly after they've met the deductible, and therefore that is why you see that more late in the year,"" he said.The companies who have reported so far, largely, aren't benefiting from low expectations, either. Expectations have remained relatively similar for earnings this quarter compared with quarters past and were a tad higher for revenue, Aurelio said.As investors make their way through fourth-quarter results and the market's volatility, the outlook for the first quarter remains not so bad.""Typically as you get closer to the next earnings season, the expectations decrease,"" Aurelio said. ""So we'd see the growth rate for Q1 normally drop, and it's been going up.""At the beginning of the year, he said, expectations were for 12.2% earnings growth in the first quarter. On Thursday, growth expectations were for 17.8%. That's despite lowered guidance from Apple (AAPL) and many iPhone chip suppliers.""So that's a pretty bullish signal,"" he said.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:The Big Picture: Will Stocks Repeat The 2011 Bear Sell-Off?Big Wage Gain Sinks Stocks, Bonds: 3 Reasons To Doubt The DataDid Congress, Trump Just Crush The Stock Market Rebound?Will Brokerages Receive Fresh Lift From Tax Reform, Rate Hikes?ObamaCare Exchange Enrollment Shows Surprise Gain, Despite Trump's Attacks

2,RMD,"Stock futures buzzed in mixed trade just ahead of Tuesday's open, through a busy morning in which federal employees headed back to work, markets reacted to earnings and regulatory news, and earthquakes and volcanoes rattled several corners of the globe.XThe Nasdaq Composite rose 0.2% at the starting bell, buoyed by strong early moves from Netflix (NFLX) and Adobe Systems (ADBE). The S&P 500 was narrowly positive as rising oil and gas prices boosted energy stocks, and as Netflix and Resmed (RMD) duked it out at the top of the index.The Dow Jones industrial average opened to tight losses, as earnings disappointments sent Procter & Gamble (PG) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) to the bottom of the list.In Washington, lawmakers cobbled together a three-week spending extension, which President Trump then signed, reopening federal offices shuttered since midnight Friday. The deal keeps federal lights on through a Feb. 8 deadline, but immigration policy remains a critical hurdle to a broader budget agreement.Markets across China and Japan posted a powerful rally Tuesday, as investors responded to the federal spending agreement in the U.S., as well as to the boosted international growth forecast released by the International Monetary Fund on Monday.Hong Kong's Hang Seng index surged 1.7% and the Shanghai Composite zoomed ahead 1.3%, while Tokyo's Nikkei 225 also posted a 1.3% advance — retaking its Jan. 18 peak to set a new record.In Europe, stocks rebounded into an afternoon rally, after apparently reacting to earthquakes overnight in Alaska, Indonesia and Papua New Guinea that triggered a set of tsunami warnings. A volcanic eruption Monday had triggered an evacuation in the Philippines, and another apparent eruption occurred in Japan.Netflix opened 11% higher after meeting analysts' fourth-quarter earnings targets, beating earnings expectations and scoring a big win in new subscribers. Netflix added 8.3 million subscribers during the quarter vs. its guidance for 6.3 million. Netflix is extended well above a 204.48 buy point in a flat base.Apple (AAPL) gained 0.2%, and all three of Netflix' FANG tech peers — Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) — showed solid early gains.Resmed surged 13% at the open, after reporting a strong fiscal second-quarter beat late Monday. The move broke shares out above a flat base buy point at 87.91.IBD 50 stock Adobe Systems powered up 1.7% in early trade. The company updated its fiscal first-quarter and full-year guidance, saying its tax rate will fall ""substantially"" under recently reformed tax rules. Adobe is extended above a 186.37 flat base buy point.A big morning for blue chip earnings reports sent Travelers (TRV) soaring 3.8% and Verizon (VZ) to a 1.1% gain, while Procter & Gamble (PG) slid 2.7% to the low end of the index.Travelers posted broad beats on both its revenue and earnings lines for the fourth quarter, despite concerns over losses tied to October's wildfires in northern California. Its stock ended Monday in a buy range, just above a 138.05 buy point in a flat base.Many China names were under pressure, despite the overnight rally in Hong Kong and Shanghai.New Oriental Education & Technology (EDU) fell 4.1% after missing analysts' fiscal second-quarter earnings targets. But the company beat views on its revenue line and forecast above-consensus revenue in the third quarter. The premarket moves suggest the stock is set to wipe out its remaining gain from an early January breakout, and fall back to a test of support at its 10-week moving average.Peer Tal Education (TAL) dropped 2% in premarket trade. China-based search engine giant Baidu (BIDU) slipped 0.6%, after a downgrade to hold, from buy, by Jefferies & Co. Baidu is attempting to complete a handle on a three-month-long cup base.Chip stocks saw some early strength, with Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) rising 2.3% and Nvidia (NVDA) up 1.3%. LED lighting chipmaker Cree (CREE) traded down almost 2%, ahead of its fiscal second-quarter earnings, due after today's close.Solar stocks showed investors rapidly adjusting to the decision by President Trump on Monday to impose steep trade tariffs on solar panels imported from China. The tariffs aim to balance the advantage of state-based China-based companies, but have also raised concerns of a widespread job losses in the solar installation field.Among China-based names, Daqo New Energy (DQ) slipped 2%. Daqo, an IBD 50 name, is extended, up nearly 105% since a breakout in October.On the U.S. side of the industry, First Solar (FSLR) climbed nearly 7% and Sunrun (RUN) surged 8%, while SunPower (SPWR) added more than 4%.Meanwhile, appliance brand Whirlpool (WHR) muscled up almost 3%, after the White House also issued tariffs on imported washing machines.  The rules impose a 20% tax on the first 1.2 million machines imported each year. The tariff rises to 50% above the 1.2 million level, as well as on all washing machine parts imported from China.RELATED:The Big Picture: These Leaders Fuel Nasdaq's AdvanceStock Futures Weaken Amid Tsunami Warning; These 5 Techs Rally OvernightThese 3 Dow Stocks, This Hot Chipmaker, United Airlines Earnings On Tap: Action PlanEnergy Giant Breaks Into Buy Zone As International Revenue Growth Outpaces U.S.

5,RMD,"In a day dominated by big-name technology stocks, the Nasdaq composite roared to a record high.The Nasdaq closed with a gain of 2.2%, as some of its largest components — including Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon.com (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT) and Intel (INTC) — rallied on earnings reports.The S&P 500, where all those stocks also have a home, climbed 0.8% and also hit a new high. The Dow Jones industrial average lagged with a 0.1% increase. Merck (MRK), off 6% after its earnings report, and Chevron (CVX), which cut its capital spending plans and slid 4%, dragged on the Dow.While technology heavyweights Amazon, Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB) and Alphabet cleared buy points or solidified breakouts, many other top-rated stocks also were breaking out.Humana (HUM) broke out of a cup-without-handle base, closing near the 259.86 buy point.IBD's TAKE: Cup-without-handle breakouts can be just as good as those stocks clearing a cup with a handle. Read more about the former in this Investor's Corner column.There was no news specifically on Humana. The health insurer in February dropped a merger with Aetna (AET), which the Wall Street Journal reported Friday is in talks to be acquired by CVS Health (CVS).The news seemed to affect other medical stocks. Hospitals, drug wholesalers and medical supply companies were mainly lower.WellCare Health Plans (WCG), another health insurer, rose above the 184.98 buy point of a flat base. The company reports earnings Tuesday before the market opens.ResMed (RMD) broke out of another flat base, sailing above the 81.97 entry in more than triple the usual volume. ResMed, which specializes in products for respiratory disorders, beat profit expectations with quarterly earnings of 66 cents a share and a 13% rise in sales to $523.7 million.

Penney (JCP) shares sold off 16% in huge volume, to all-time lows.

7,RMD,"Stocks closed mixed Friday, with the Nasdaq composite lagging noticeably while a few sectors stood out for a fine performance.XThe Nasdaq lost 0.6%, hurt by weakness in semiconductors, data storage and internet stocks. The S&P 500 fell 0.1%. The Dow Jones industrial average added 0.1%. All three managed to close above the 50-day moving averages, which can be taken as a positive sign.The Russell 2000 fell a fraction.Volume was lower compared with Thursday, according to early numbers. Losers topped winners by 8-to-7 on the NYSE. But curiously, Nasdaq winners led losers by 11 to 10, which suggests the selling was concentrated on just certain areas of the composite.Equifax (EFX) plunged nearly 14% to 123.23 in the highest volume in at least many years, after it disclosed late Thursday that hackers had breached its computers and may have stolen sensitive information on 143 million consumers.A few other financial stocks fared much better.Despite an expected rush of hurricane-related claims, insurance stocks led the market. Marsh & McLennan (MMC) leapt above the 81.10 buy point of a base-on-base pattern. Volume was more than double the average, a good sign for the breakout.The New York-based firm provides insurance, reinsurance, risk management, human resources and other services. Its insurance broker industry group was one of Friday's best.Moody's (MCO) edged above its 135.30 buy point. The provider of credit ratings for institutional investors saw slow trading, about two-thirds less volume than normal. That made the breakout suspicious.Building industry stocks, as well some leisure and health care industry groups, also made gains of more than 1% in today's trading.The medical products industry group is another one showing bullish behavior, with two more breakouts in the group Friday.Baxter International (BAX) topped the 63.24 buy point of a flat base. ResMed (RMD) broke out past a 79.73 buy point of a cup-without-handle base. Although the price gains were strong, volume was disappointingly weak in both stocks. Still, the breakouts followed one by Boston Scientific (BSX) on Thursday. Shares of the medical device maker followed through on Friday, despite lackluster volume on that breakout.Consolidated Edison (ED), a utility that serves the New York-New Jersey area, rose above the 85.23 buy point of a flat base. But volume was below average. Utility stocks have been trending higher, with the SPDR Utilities (XLU) ETF near record highs.RELATED:These Cybersecurity Stocks Are Rising On Equifax's Mass Hack

12,RMD,"Fidelity Investments has launched a new series of mutual funds to help investors handle their IRA-required withdrawals and avoid penalty taxes.The new funds are called Simplicity RMD Funds, which are basically target-date funds that calculate a shareholder's required minimum distribution (RMD) for him or her. If you want, the funds will also pay out that amount to you annually. Investors generally must begin to take RMDs from tax-deferred retirement accounts such as IRAs by April 1 of the year after you reach age 70-1/2.""Retirees often struggle to understand when, which assets, what amount and how to take the annually mandated withdrawal from their tax-deferred retirement accounts,"" Ken Hevert, senior vice president of retirement at Fidelity, said in a release. If you don't withdraw at least the full RMD amount, the shortfall is subject to a 50% tax penalty.If you are still working, most people are allowed to delay RMDs from a 401(k) account. That exemption does not apply to IRAs. And RMDs are not required from a Roth IRA while you're still alive.Fidelity's Simplicity RMD Funds specify a year in their names. That date is the year when a shareholder turns 70. Each fund is designed for people who have turned or will turn age 70 within five years of the RMD date.For example, the Simplicity RMD 2020 Fund is suitable for people whose birthdays are between Jan. 1, 1948 and Dec. 31, 1952. Fidelity expects most shareholders to buy shares as they approach age 70, but people can buy shares at any time, including years or decades prior to their RMD date, as if it were a regular target-date fund.As of June 1, the RMD 2020 Fund's asset mix was 54% stocks, 35% bonds and 11% short-term securities such as bonds and cash.Target-dated funds' names typically include the year when a shareholder plans to retire.Like target-date funds, Simplicity RMD funds invest in a mix of stocks, fixed income and cash through other Fidelity mutual funds, including money market funds. The RMD funds adjust their asset allocations over time.Payouts begin at a shareholder's mandatory RMD date. Even after a fund reaches its RMD date, its asset mix continues to grow more conservative for many years. After about 10 to 20 years, its asset mix will be identical to or nearly identical to Fidelity Simplicity RMD Income Fund's, whose asset allocation remains mostly unchanged. At that point, the dated RMD fund is merged into the income fund and payouts are made from that portfolio.In this new Simplicity series of funds, the RMD calculation and distribution features are optional. If you don't want to use them, you can still invest in one or more of these funds without using those optional features.Annual expense ratios range from 0.5% for the $22.2 million RMD 2005 Fund (FIRPX) to 0.62% for the $9.3 million RMD 2020 (FIRWX). The $9.6 million RMD Income (FIRNX) levies a 0.47% fee. In comparison, $30.9 billion Fidelity Balanced Fund (FBALX) — a traditional stocks-plus-bonds portfolio — assesses a 0.55% expense ratio.RELATED:You Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And IncomeThe Painless Way To Add $140,000 To Your Retirement Account

13,RMD,"Worried about going broke after you retire? Then join the crowd: In this era of longer retirements, fewer pensions, choppy markets and low savings rates, evidently many are vexed.  People wonder: Will Social Security be enough? Will savings last? What if inflation roars, or stock prices plunge? Or you need long-term care?""Americans across all demographics are deeply worried about maintaining their standard of living in retirement,"" says Kelly Kenneally, communication advisor at the National Institute on Retirement Security. According to a new NIRS report she co-authored, fully 76% of those surveyed fear economic conditions ""will affect their ability to have a secure retirement.""But as unnerving as it all may be, experts say there are solutions: roadmaps to guide financial planning through the golden years. Key points range from budgeting, to the timing of when to tap which funds, to paying for what could become pricey health care. Here's how some financial pros explain these points that can help keep you solvent:1. Make a financial plan that starts with a budget. To help gauge your costs, figure that for retirees, spending tends to run 20% to 30% lower than pre-retirement earnings, says David Laster, managing director and head of retirement strategies at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAC). The math could work this way: If your annual pre-retirement salary was $80,000, and of that you'd saved $10,000, you'd be left with $70,000. When you trim the new total 20% to 30%, you get a retirement spending amount of between $49,000 and $56,000, Laster says.From there, you classify spending as either essential, such as for food and housing, or discretionary for, say, entertainment and travel. Preferably pay for essential needs with guaranteed income, such as a pension and Social Security, Laster recommends. But if possible, wait to start collecting Social Security until age 70, when you can claim the largest possible benefit.2. Determine how much you can safely withdraw from savings.  Evidently, many new retirees haven't done the math: According to a 2014 survey of spending by new retirees, only 48% of respondents had a withdrawal plan for their investable assets. What should it be?Judith Ward, senior financial planner at T. Rowe Price, recommends withdrawing a maximum of 4% from retirement savings in the first year you need the money. ""That conservative rate guards against overspending in the earlier years of retirement,"" says Ward. In subsequent years, you can adjust that 4% to account for inflation and/or swings in your investment returns.3. Identify which retirement sources to use when. Many experts agree: Start by using any guaranteed income.If you still need money before age 70-1/2, tap your taxable accounts, starting with their cash flows, such as dividends or interest, recommends Colleen Jaconetti, senior investment strategist in Vanguard's Investment Strategy Group. As Jaconetti explains, typically you'll owe taxes on these funds whether they are spent or reinvested. (Reinvesting them and then liquidating holdings later to meet spending needs will likely incur additional taxes.)Plan to use up taxable assets before moving to your tax-advantaged funds.At age 70-1/2, you'll have to start taking required minimum distributions (RMD) from your tax-deferred retirement accounts. (These funds will be taxed at the ordinary income tax rate.) Use RMD money, along with taxable assets if needed, until the taxable funds are gone. Then, decide between using assets in tax-deferred, or in tax-free Roth, holdings. As a rule of thumb, advises Jaconetti: First spend from the Roth accounts if you'll likely pay a lower tax rate in the future. If the opposite is true, first tap your tax-deferred accounts, such as your traditional IRAs.4. Set your asset allocation. Although experts' advice differs, many pros echo this theme: Given your potentially long time in retirement, your portfolio will still need growth assets, such as stocks. But ""you also need to temper your downside risk,"" says Vanguard's Jaconetti. ""In talking to retirees, I commonly hear a preference for 40% to 60% weightings to stocks — depending on people's risk tolerance and goals."" Later, rebalance the portfolio if assets rise or fall out of their target range.5. Figure out how to pay for medical costs. Indeed, much of Medicare's costs can be added up and included in your overall budget, holds Garrett Ball, owner of 65 Medicare.org, an independent Medicare insurance brokerage.  Bear in mind that Medicare's monthly Part B premium, which covers outpatient services, is deducted from your Social Security payment. Beyond that, if you choose traditional Medicare — vs. a Medicare Advantage plan — you'll pay for both supplemental insurance and for your Medicare Part D drug program. In contrast, with Medicare Advantage you'll pay the plan's premium, if there is one, and then estimate likely out-of-pocket medical costs, such as co-pays and deductibles, Ball explains.However, Medicare generally doesn't cover long-term care. Experts suggest planning for it via a long-term care insurance policy, best purchased before age 60 — or by creating a set-aside, in the order of about $100,000 to $200,000.RELATED:Here's How Much $20 A Week In Retirement Savings Can Mushroom Into

14,RMD,"Shares of ResMed (RMD), a maker of CPAP masks to help with sleep disorders, launched Tuesday to a five-month high as fiscal Q2 sales beat expectations by $15 million, leading JPMorgan analyst David Low to call for a ""return to double-digit growth.""ResMed stock closed up 9.6% at 69.72 on the stock market today, after earlier hitting a five-month high at 70.76. Shares broke out of a cup-with-handle formation, extending 6% from a 65.88 entry point, on ResMed's earnings beat, posted after the close Monday.For the quarter ended Dec. 31, ResMed reported $530.4 million in sales and 73 cents earnings per share minus items, up a respective 17% and flat vs. the year-earlier quarter. Both metrics easily topped the consensus of 14 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters for $515.6 million and 70 cents.Low expects ResMed to experience a return to double-digit earnings growth, after single-digit year-over-year growth in six of the past seven quarters, and declines in the preceding quarters. Before 2014, ResMed consistently reported double-digit EPS ex items growth, but then had a four-quarter streak of declines starting in June 2014.IBD'S TAKE: ResMed showed off several sleep-inducing products at CES 2017 in Las Vegas. Which other gadgets will literally put you to sleep?During fiscal Q2, ResMed launched its AirFit N20 nasal mask and F20 full face mask. Both are outfitted with an ""infinity seal,"" which CEO Mick Farrell described on the late Monday earnings conference call with analysts as a significant advance ""in fit and comfort to the patients.""The Food and Drug Administration also approved ResMed's AirMini, a travel CPAP.But the quarter wasn't totally clean, Needham analyst Mike Matson said Tuesday. Though flow generators grew 16% vs. the year-earlier quarter to $301 million in sales, that was helped by the liquidation of AirStart devices and some stocking orders in China, he wrote in a research note.And masks and accessories only grew a fraction in Q2. Matson kept his underperform rating on ResMed stock.Low, on the other hand, upgraded ResMed stock to overweight from neutral, and boosted his price target to 72 from 63.50.Low blames slow mask sales on the fact that ResMed's N20 and F20 products are still gaining traction in the U.S.""Given the positive industry feedback and ResMed's strong track record with new products, we expect sales to pick up rapidly during 2017,"" he wrote in a report. ""This in turn should support a lift in gross margins and profits.""RELATED:Medtronic Downgraded On Increased Boston, J&J, St. Jude RivalriesBoston Scientific Acquisition Eyes Rivals Edwards, MedtronicJ&J Hep C Dips To 'Virtually Zero,' Mirroring Gilead; 2017 Views Lag

15,RMD,"LAS VEGAS – Consumer electronics companies already make gadgets for your every waking minute, and now they're going after the minutes when you're asleep.One of the breakout categories of products at CES 2017 involves devices related to sleep technology. Sleep gadgets ranging from smart beds and blankets to relaxation technology and devices that emit calming sounds and scents are on display at the four-day show, which ends Sunday.The Consumer Technology Association, owner of CES, even gave the category its own exhibitor floor showcase for the first time at the 2017 show.Michael Breus, aka ""The Sleep Doctor,"" said sleep technology at CES used to be limited to monitoring devices, usually fitness bands, which track if you had a restful sleep.""Right now one of the biggest problems in the sleep monitoring world is what I call the 'So what?' issue,"" Breus told IBD. ""Let's say I got 22% REM and 18% deep sleep. So what? What can I do with that information? That's where we're starting to head.""Many of the latest sleep devices offer personalized suggestions on how to get a better night's sleep. Others go a step further and help you fall asleep and stay asleep.Sleep tech products at CES fall into three buckets: monitoring devices, relaxation devices and technology infused into existing products such as beds, pillows and sheets, Breus said.Sleep Number, owned by Select Comfort (SCSS), introduced its Sleep Number 360 smart bed at this year's CES. The bed senses and automatically adjusts comfort to keep both occupants sleeping soundly depending on the circumstances, the company said.For instance, the Sleep Number 360 bed adjusts the air columns in the mattress to react to a person shifting from their side, back or stomach sleeping profiles. It also has automatic snore detection and adjustment.Plus, the Sleep Number 360 has a foot-warming feature to help people fall asleep faster.""At our company, what we're trying to do is be the conduit or liaison between real sleep science and translating that so consumers can benefit from what we learn by building it into our products,"" said Pete Bils, vice president of sleep science and research at Select Comfort.The Sleep Number 360 knows when you get into bed and can track your heart rate and respiration as well as sleep cycles and stores that information for you in the internet cloud for review, Bils said.""By the time you hit 50, you'll spend 17 years in a bed,"" Bils said. ""So is a bed important? You tell me.""Athletic apparel company Under Armour (UA) also has gotten into the sleep tech game. At CES, the Baltimore-based company launched its first Athlete Recovery Sleepwear.UA Athlete Recovery Sleepwear was developed in collaboration with Under Armour-sponsored athlete Tom Brady, who credits sleep as one of the most important components to his training regimen.The sleepwear uses bioceramics technology. A pattern of bioceramic particles on the inside of the fabric absorbs infrared wavelengths emitted by the body and reflects back Far Infrared, helping the body recover faster while promoting better sleep, Under Armour says.Under Armour also has added a sleep recovery feature to its UA Record fitness app for smartphones.Also at CES, ResMed (RMD), a medical device firm known for its sleep apnea products, launched a new joint venture to help all people improve their sleep.ResMed has joined surgeon and television host Dr. Mehmet Oz and private equity firm Pegasus Capital Advisors on a venture called SleepScore Labs. The initial focus of the venture is to compile and analyze the most comprehensive and accurate collection of consumer sleep data. It will use ResMed's sleep monitoring technology for consumers, the S+ by ResMed.""Our goal is to solve sleep using science,"" said Colin Lawler, chief executive of SleepScore Labs.The consumer sleep market currently generates about $58 billion in annual sales. That includes everything from mattresses, sleeping pills, lotions, accessories and other things, Lawler said.""The problem is nobody knows what works and what doesn't work,"" Lawlor said. SleepScore Labs wants to address that need with scientific research, he said.Cambridge Sound Management, the world's largest commercial sound masking company, debuted its consumer solution called Nightingale at CES 2017.Nightingale produces soothing ambient sounds, called sound blankets, to mask unwanted noises. The sound blankets take into account a room's acoustics and sleep conditions like snoring or tinnitus, said Meghann Ellis, chief financial officer of Cambridge Sound Management.Cambridge Sound Management decided to get into the consumer market after a lot of people asked it to provide a solution for the bedroom, knowing its work from office buildings, Ellis said.

16,RMD,"Like many professional service providers, financial advisors tend to enjoy interacting with clients and solving their problems. But they dread the paperwork.Completing forms accurately and promptly demands ongoing diligence. And compliance requirements elevate paperwork from an important nuisance to an essential element of a successful financial advice practice.Tackling administrative and support tasks, such as filing and archiving digital communications, can seem manageable for advisors who are just starting out. But as a practice grows, high volume can put your paperwork systems and procedures to the test.Technological advances are leading some independent advisors to go paperless. But the initial investment in time and money — and the learning curve associated with transitioning to online communications and documentation — remains an obstacle for many financial planners.""I don't like paperwork,"" said Dan Carter, an advisor in Oxnard, Calif. ""I'm more of an extrovert. But we have to do all the paperwork in a timely manner for our clients.""In his 18 years as an advisor, Carter has learned to delegate support tasks to a reliable assistant who has a keen eye for detail. When meeting new clients, Carter introduces his assistant — who's also his wife — as a key member of his team.""That way, they get to know her and she builds rapport with them,"" he said.Carter uses Dropbox, a cloud-based file-sharing and storage service, to leave notes for his assistant. She checks them daily and follows through, often by submitting client data to third parties, such as insurers.In working with financial institutions and insurance companies on behalf of his clients, Carter knows that paperwork errors can occur despite his best efforts. When his assistant gets backed up and he completes client forms, he can hit a few temporary roadblocks.""Sometimes I fill out a new client application and it gets kicked back to me,"" he said. ""It's almost like a tennis game.""Rather than enter client information multiple times in multiple fields, for example, Carter may provide it in the first section of the application and then write ""See Section 1"" when asked for the same data again. That rarely works.""They don't like that,"" he said. ""They don't want to fill out my paperwork for me.""In 2014, Carter stumbled when trying to help his clients — a wealthy married couple — apply for life insurance. The carrier's medical underwriters repeatedly attempted to schedule a meeting with the couple to no avail.""Some of it was our fault,"" he admitted. ""We weren't on top of it and we didn't follow it all the way through. The process took three to four months, and I got weary of apologizing.""Carter wound up losing the clients. But he tightened his procedures after the incident and now monitors communications with insurers more closely.The simplest paperwork tasks can pose some of the greatest challenges. Every year, advisors track the required minimum distribution (RMD) that certain clients must withdraw from their retirement accounts. It's straightforward, but problems can erupt.Robert Braglia, a certified financial planner in New York City, cites a rare case when he realized belatedly that he didn't prepare for a client's RMD well before the Dec. 31 deadline.""It created last-minute stress,"" he said. ""Now I have a spreadsheet with every client that has a RMD. I'm ready as the fourth quarter rolls around.""As an advisor's practice grows, the office staff's role grows as well. Managing the many details of client accounts demands clear communication among an advisory firm's employees.Michael Resnick, a certified financial planner in Deerfield, Ill., appreciates the value of completing paperwork with accuracy and timeliness. In his five years as an advisor, he has sought to continually refine his internal processes to prevent paperwork errors.About three years ago, Resnick helped a client purchase a large life insurance policy. He asked his assistant to fill out the application.""The owner of the policy was supposed to be my client's trust,"" Resnick recalled. ""But my assistant mistakenly made my client the owner.""Resnick caught the error at the last minute and fixed it. But had the mistake gone unnoticed, it could've triggered adverse tax consequences for the client.""After that, we changed how we communicate,"" he said. ""I learned when I ask an assistant to do something, I need to be very clear on the circumstances behind it so that everything is done properly.""He also credits his customer relationship management (CRM) system for helping him track client communications and process paperwork. And after recently reading ""The Checklist Manifesto"" by Atul Gawande, Resnick is creating checklists to avoid errors.RELATED:Advisory Firms Find Success In Attracting Smart InternsHow A Top Financial Advisor Turned A Lemon Investment Into A Successful Career

66,RMD,"QCDs are direct donations from IRAs to qualified charities. They won't count as itemized deductions, as other contributions will.
"
67,RMD,"But they will count as required minimum distributions (RMDs) from your IRA. And the amounts sent to charity won't be included in your taxable income.

69,RMD,"Why bother with QCDs when you can't take a deduction? Because sending IRA money to charity can fulfill your RMD requirement without generating taxable income.

70,RMD,"Avoiding income from RMDs can keep your adjusted gross income (AGI) down. And a lower AGI can have ripple benefits throughout your tax return.

71,RMD,"Not only will you have lower taxable income, you might get more deductions in areas such as medical expenses and losses from rental property.

75,RMD,"Most traditional IRA owners are familiar with the concept of a required minimum distribution (RMD) — and if not, you should be. Starting at age 70.5, account holders are required to remove a portion of assets from their IRAs each year as a distribution. It's important to note that in most cases RMDs only apply to traditional IRAs, not their Roth IRA counterparts. 
"
76,RMD,"If you use a self-directed IRA to invest in real estate or other alternative assets, the RMD rules and nuances are, for the most part, the same as they are for traditional IRAs. For example, the first distribution must be taken by April 1st of the year following the year in which you turn 70.5, but for all subsequent years distributions must be taken by December 31st. 
"
77,RMD,"For example, if you turned 70.5 in 2014, you have until April 1st, 2015 to take your first distribution and December 31st, 2015 to take your next one. There are significant penalties for not taking your RMD during the correct timeframe, including potentially having the non-distributed portion taxed at 50% (excise tax.) 
"
78,RMD,"Another similarity is the way that the distribution amount is calculated. For both traditional and self-directed IRAs, the number is determined based on the account holder's age, the IRA's previous year account balance, and a ""withdrawal factor"" that is primarily based on life expectancy. There are many calculators out there that can help you predict your next RMD, but the institution(s) where you hold your account(s) will also do it for you. 
"
79,RMD,"However, institutions can't see all the IRAs you may hold in other places, so it's ultimately the account holder's responsibility to determine the total RMD amount for all of your accounts. 
"
80,RMD,"The ‘You Choose' Method: 
"
81,RMD,"For most traditional IRAs, the most common distribution method is cash, which means the account either has to have cash available or securities must be sold in order to fulfill the distribution. If you have multiple accounts, you can take all or part of the total distribution from any account you choose — so if one IRA has more cash than another one, you can rely on it for your RMD and leave your other account(s) alone. 
"
82,RMD,"The ‘In-Kind' Method: 
"
83,RMD,"But what happens if your IRAs hold only illiquid assets? This is a question that comes up repeatedly with self-directed IRAs, because most alternative assets — including real estate — tend to be illiquid by nature. The typical solution to this is a little-known RMD option: take the ""distribution in-kind"". 
"
84,RMD,"For example, let's say you own 100% of a piece of property in your IRA that's worth $100,000, and your RMD is $10,000. You can distribute $10,000 worth of said property to yourself via grant deed. Essentially, your self-directed IRA custodian assigns that portion of the property to you personally, and that would satisfy your RMD for the year. This can work for mortgage-backed notes as well, where the custodian writes a partial Assignment of Deed of Trust/Mortgage to the account holder personally for the amount of the RMD. 
"
85,RMD,"Whether you hold a traditional or self-directed IRA (or both), RMDs are a fact of life — and one that should be taken seriously. The good news is that there are a few options available that can allow you to meet the IRS regulations without compromising your investment strategy. Talk to your financial professional or institution to find out if one of these options will work for you.

ResMed, which sells devices to treat breathing obstructions during sleep, had the strongest report among the batch of leading medical stocks that unveiled their quarterly results Thursday, beating on both the top and bottom lines. As…
"
127,RMD,"When Michael Farrell took the helm of ResMed in March, he came aboard in interesting times.
"
128,RMD,"His father, Peter Farrell, had founded and built the company into a leader in devices to treat sleep apnea — disruptions to breathing while sleeping — with rock-steady quarterly growth and a frequent residency in the IBD 50.
"
129,RMD,"But 2013 has been a difficult year for the industry. ObamaCare brought with it a new tax on devices, and the second round of competitive bidding under the 2003 Medicare Modernization Act has been squeezing prices. The magnitude of the latter was one reason ResMed's fiscal first quarter, reported in late October, missed expectations and hurt the stock.
"
130,RMD,"Yet, Farrell is confident in the growth prospects for ResMed (RMD), as it continues to penetrate sleep apnea and branches out into respiratory care. He spoke with IBD recently about his new gig.
"
131,RMD,"IBD: The impact of the competitive bidding seemed to take Wall Street by surprise in the last quarter. Did it surprise you?
"
132,RMD,"Farrell: To put things in perspective, the U.S. market is about 50% of our global business, and Medicare is about 25% of that. So you're talking about 12% or less of the covered lives ResMed looks after.
"
133,RMD,"It's been a two- or three-year process since competitive bidding, round one, started. Round one was nine cities, and competitive bidding round two was 91 cities. So we already knew there would be different impacts, but clearly there's been some temporary distraction of our channel through round two. We had indicated it to the market and had discussions about it. I think when the reality of it hit in Q1, there were some investors who may have been slightly surprised. But we always knew it would be a challenge, and we said on the (earnings conference) call that it will take a number of months for the distraction to clear up.
"
134,RMD,"But the real focus is the long-term growth, which is incredibly exciting. What we focused on, talking about the rest of FY2014 and beyond, (was) that patient volumes — even in the U.S. market, even affected with ObamaCare, even with global financial crisis recovery and unemployment rates where they are — the patients turning up in primary-care offices, getting referrals to specialists in sleep diagnosis and therapy, (are) solid. So it's like you've got a garden hose with a bit of a crimp in it. Over the coming months, the garden hose is going to straighten out and start fertilizing the lawn.
"
135,RMD,"IBD: After the last report, analyst Raj Denhoy of Jefferies wrote, ""There is still little acknowledgment from the company that private insurers could follow (Medicare's) lead and slash rates in the approximate 65% of the market outside Medicare."" How do you respond to that?
"
136,RMD,"Farrell: It's about 75% that's private pay — Aetna (AET), Cigna (CI), Blue Cross/Blue Shield, innumerable others. What private payors have been doing for the last 10 to 15 years is adjusting on a mark-to-market, supply-and-demand basis on all of their services. (They've) actually had a very efficient reimbursement-reduction program. They do not respond to Medicare because Medicare really had a public process to try and catch up with where private pay already was. So private pay isn't looking to Medicare saying, ""Oooh, should we adjust rates 'cause they've caught up to us?"" It's the other way around.
"
137,RMD,"IBD: What can we expect from ResMed over the next year?
"
138,RMD,"Farrell: We've got quite a lot of exciting announcements for the coming 12 months. We will have three new mask systems. In the last 12 months (our mask systems) changed north of 7 million lives. We delivered around a million devices that sit on someone's bedside table that provide pressured, humidified and controlled air to the lungs. And we also delivered north of 6 million mask systems that have to be comfortable because the patients wear them all night and for the rest of their lives every night. We have three new products on that 6 million side, where ResMed is really the global leader and the No. 1 patient-preferred brand.
"
139,RMD,"Of course, I can't give you details about them, but I can give you a personal anecdote. I wear our devices. I don't have apnea, but like many people I have a tendency to snore when I use alcohol or have a large meal. In testing our products, my wife found that when I use the product I don't snore. And I actually feel better in the morning — have less of a hangover and more of an ability to participate with my children.
"
140,RMD,"I have personally started wearing one of our new masks, which will be coming out in the new year. This mask is the most comfortable, most quiet and best treatment I have ever seen. And, of course, I'm slightly biased.

209,RMD,"When it comes to retirement planning, IRAs are still Americans' main tool.
"
210,RMD,"We had $5.7 trillion tucked away in IRAs as of the end of the second quarter, according to the Investment Company Institute. That dwarfed the $3.8 trillion at work in 401(k) plans.
"
211,RMD,"But harsh tax rules mean that a false step with your IRA can be costly. So here are six tips for making the most of your IRA, both for yourself and your heirs.
"
212,RMD," Beneficiary. Many people think of their will as the document with the last say when it comes to their estate. That's not true for your IRA.
"
213,RMD,"For that account, your beneficiary is the person you name in your IRA custodian's designation form. It does not matter who, if anyone, you name in your will. A community property state may require you to designate your spouse, says IRA Advisor editor Ed Slott.
"
214,RMD,"So, if you want to name a beneficiary, use that form. If you want to change your beneficiary, file an amended designation form with your financial firm.
"
215,RMD," RMDs. With a traditional IRA, the owner must start required minimum distributions (RMDs) by April 1 of the year after he or she turns 70-1/2. RMDs are based on IRS life expectancy tables. You calculate each year's RMD by dividing the balance as of the prior Dec. 31 by your life expectancy in the IRS table that applies to you.
"
216,RMD," Roth IRA. You can avoid having to take RMDs by using a Roth IRA instead of a traditional one, or by converting a traditional IRA to a Roth. With a Roth, no RMDs are required. You can convert a traditional IRA to a Roth. You'll owe income tax on the amount converted, but your eventual withdrawals, if any, will be tax free. That can leave more for your heirs to inherit tax free.
"
217,RMD," Rules for heirs. Heirs do not have as good a deal as an original account owner does. After getting the account tax-free, nonspousal heirs must start withdrawals, based on an age-based formula, by Dec. 31 of the year after they inherit the IRA. That's the case whether it's a traditional or Roth IRA.
"
218,RMD,"Younger beneficiaries can take smaller withdrawals, allowing the account balance to keep growing tax-deferred longer.
"
219,RMD,"Some heirs mistakenly think they don't need to take RMDs from an inherited Roth. They do. But there's no tax. ""But if they don't make the withdrawal, they're subject to a 50% penalty — far worse than any tax would have been,"" Slott said.
"
220,RMD," Spouses. Spousal heirs can keep an inherited IRA as an inherited IRA or roll it into his or her own name. The terminology matters.
"
221,RMD,"If a spousal heir takes an inherited IRA (traditional or Roth) as a beneficiary, then RMDs must start in the year his or her deceased spouse would have turned 70-1/2. But if she takes a traditional IRA as a rollover, it is treated as if it had always been hers. If she is young, it may be years or even decades before RMDs must start. If it's a Roth, RMDs never start.
"
222,RMD,"Still, a spousal heir younger than 59-1/2 should take it as an inherited IRA in case she needs the money. That way she can dip into the account without paying a 10% penalty for early withdrawal, Slott says.
"
223,RMD," Estates. Never name your estate as a beneficiary unless you have no beneficiaries or don't care about their tax burden, Slott says.
"
224,RMD,"RMDs for an estate follow different rules. In many cases the withdrawals must be within a short number of years, resulting in quick depletion of the original account.When it comes to retirement planning, IRAs are still Americans' main tool.We had $5.7 trillion tucked away in IRAs as of the end of the second quarter, according to the Investment Company Institute.

286,RMD,"August arrivals upon the IBD 50 present a mixed-bag of companies, with various levels of familiarity with watchers of our top-stocks list.Grand Canyon Education had only been off a very short time, but for Gartner, ResMed and Seagate, it's been much longer, years.Whether the stocks that breezed in on the summer wind will take stick around is impossible to say, but let's take a look at August's arrivals, by their latest IBD 50 ranking:28. ResMed (RMD). The maker of airflow generators and other products to treat sleep apnea and other sleeping disorders rejoined the IBD 50 on Aug. 6. One big reason was the 12% jump in its shares on Aug. 3, after its fiscal Q3 results beat Wall Street expectations. The breathing-device maker has been boosting its profit margins by giving more emphasis on its higher-end products. A new U.S. tax on certain medical devices, set to take effect next year, will impact ResMed. But BMO Capital Markets analyst Joanne Wuensch says executives have assured her the impact will be ""minimal,"" as we recently reported. The stock hit an entry buy point of 35.23 the day of its big 12% jump. It closed Friday at 36.90, so it's less than 5% extended. Founder Peter Farrell left the company in 2007 but returned as CEO in February 2011.29. Grand Canyon Education (LOPE). The company popped back on the IBD 50 this month after being off . .. a week. It was one the Monday IBD 50s for three weeks in July, but that was its first time back in the rankings in a long time. The for-profit educational firm mostly offers online degree courses, though it also runs a traditional campus in Phoenix. The campus has sports teams called the Antelopes, which accounts for the LOPE stock ticker. New laws designed to cut down on student loan defaults at for-profit schools have not hurt the company as much as originally feared, analysts recently told IBD. ""Grand Canyon is well above the compliance thresholds,"" said Jerry Herman, analyst with Stifel Nicolaus. The company emphasizes what some consider practical fields, such nursing and business, that prepare students for the real workforce. The stock jumped 20% on Aug. 7 after it raised its full-year guidance.41. Gartner (IT). Tech research firm Gartner returned, after a long absence, to the IBD 50 with a heady No. 38 ranking on Aug. 13, and now checks in No. 41. The stock last month hit a 44.34 buy point out of a cup-with-handle base. It closed Friday at 48.76, so it's nearly 10% extended, a bit further than optimum. The stock rose more than 5% on Aug. 3, to an all-time high for the 33-year-old company, after earnings beat views and it maintained its guidance. And the stock is up slightly since then. Since the start of 2010, Gartner's quarterly year-over-year EPS growth has been at least 14%, with sales rising 9% to 17%. It's performed better than other publicly traded tech research firms Forrester Research (FORR) and ComScore (SCOR). Gartner has an IBD Composite Rating — our broadest measure of performance over the past 12 months — of 97, putting it among the top 3% of all stocks. It claims clients in 85 countries, and is well-known by business journalists, including IBD. In fact, Gartner says its analysts are quoted in the business press an average of 70 times a week.47. Seagate Technology (STX). It's been years, but disk drive maker Seagate Technology, one of tech's longtimers, returned to the IBD 50 list of Aug. 13. It did fall off our Aug. 15 rankings, but is back on with the latest list, at No. 47. The stock broke out of a 13-week base and hit a 32.65 buy point on Tuesday. It closed Friday at 35.67, up 3%, and that's a nearly 12-year high. This is so even though the company lowered its guidance on July 30. But Seagate and archrival Western Digital (WDC) are rebounding from the terrible flooding in Thailand last year that wiped out much of their production operations. Western Digital's good results in late July boosted both it and Seagate, as we reported. The 26-year-old company has seen a ton of ebb and flow in its industry, as its chief financial officer, Patrick O'Malley, told IBD in June: ""When I started in 1988 at Seagate, there were 92 disk drive companies. Now we are down to three — Western Digital, Seagate and Toshiba (but) the competition remains intense.""Follow Mike Krey on Twitter

327,RMD,"Leading stocks behaved commendably as the market nosed down into correction mode and as blue chips like Chevron (CVX), Caterpillar (CAT) and  Home Depot (HD)crumbled.Nearly three-in-four IBD 50 stocks maintained support at or above their 10-week moving averages during the week. About 17 stocks in the group pulled back to test support. Nearly 20 others simply hovered stubbornly above the line.The most notable exception was Apple (AAPL) . The iPad maker slipped toward forbidden fruit territory, diving 3% for the week in heavy trade, ending 5% below its 10-week line. That left it only 11% below its Sept. 21 high. Monday's drop through the 10-week average in heavy trade, and the stock's D- Accumulation-Distribution Rating raise bright red flags.On the more positive side, DaVita (DVA) grabbed a new high in a fourth straight weekly advance. That put the dialysis clinic operator 10% above a 100.62 flat base buy point.Grand Canyon Education (LOPE) aced what was maybe a less obvious win. It rose less than 1% for the week, just enough to notch a new high and end 10% above a 21.64 buy point following a Sept. 4 breakout. More importantly, it completed a three-weeks-tight pattern and its new high sets up a buy point at 24.51. The cautions here are that the prior cup-with-handle base was dangerously V-shaped, and the Consumer Services-Education industry group ranks a weak No. 154.Stocks just easing back to their 10-week moving averages, like  NeuStar (NSR) and ResMed (RMD), could be setting the stage for rebounds. But you want to see them rise, on volume, and have the market toggled back into an uptrend before stepping in to buy.Google (GOOG) turned in its first weekly loss since the week ended July 13. It's still a long way from a test of support, but it may take a break and put together a base or at least a follow-on buy point.Cirrus Logic (CRUS), Mellanox Technologies (MLNX) and Francesca's Holdings (FRAN) were among the 10% of IBD 50 stocks that continued to lag below their 10-week moving averages. Stratasys (SSYS) made a second, valiant effort to break with that crowd and retake its 10-week line. But it didn't get the volume support it needed and managed only to end flat at the line.A few leaders, in addition to Apple, carved below their 10-week moving averages during the week.

"
342,RMD,"In the year you turn 70 1/2, the tax system puts the lid on Traditional IRA contributions and pulls the plug on your retirement accounts in the form of required minimum distributions (RMDs).

Let's take a look at the major differences among the most popular retirement plan options and examine how to structure your plans to optimize your distributions.
"
344,RMD,"Retirement Account Highlights
"
345,RMD,"Traditional IRA
"
346,RMD,"Once you turn 70 1/2, you are no longer allowed to contribute to a Traditional IRA. In addition, you must begin the process of taking annual RMDs.
"
347,RMD,"Roth IRA
"
348,RMD,"Anyone with earned wages may contribute to a Roth IRA, and there is no mandate requiring the contributor or his or her spouse to make RMDs. 
"
349,RMD,"Traditional 401(k) 
"
350,RMD,"Regardless of age, if you are still working you can continue to contribute to a 401(k). As long as you own less than 5% of the business you are working for, you are not required to take RMDs.
"
351,RMD,"Roth 401(k) 
"
352,RMD,"Regardless of age, if you are still working you can contribute the full amount of your salary deferral to a Roth 401(k). Like the traditional 401(k), RMDs are required once you separate from service or if you own more than 5% of the business that employs you. This is a key difference between a Roth 401(k) and its Traditional Roth IRA counterpart. 
"
353,RMD,"Retirement Plan Showdowns
"
354,RMD,"Traditional IRA vs. Pretax 401(k) 
"
355,RMD,"If you are older than 70 1/2, you lose the ability to contribute to a Traditional IRA. On the other hand, there is no age restriction placed on the 70+ crowd for contributions to a 401(k), so this option is still a possibility. In many cases, the golden-age worker is usually some kind of self-employed consultant or contractor, so these people need to be aware of the RMD requirements placed on the 5% or greater business owner. At first glance, the idea of contributing to a plan that requires you to take RMDs each year sounds silly, but if you do the math it's really not a bad deal.
"
356,RMD,"Example - Pretax 401(k)
"
357,RMD,"In 2011, a 75-year-old self-employed worker making $80,000 contributed $22,000 to his new 401(k); the plan has a December 31, 2011, balance of $22,000. The 2012 RMD for the now 76-year-old worker will only be $1,000. If you take the end of year balance of $22,000 and divide it by the RMD factor of a 76-year-old, 22, you end up with a taxable distribution of $1,000. After all is said and done, the net result for the individual would be a $21,000 deduction. 
"
358,RMD,"The point here is that the opportunity to save is not drastically diminished because you have to make RMDs while you are working.

"
360,RMD,"Roth IRA vs. Roth 401(k) 
"
361,RMD,"If you are over 70 1/2 and you are working, you will have the ability to contribute to both types of accounts. While the income restrictions governing who can contribute to a Roth IRA can be difficult to overcome, it isn't impossible. The reason it isn't impossible involves how the income ceiling for the contribution is determined. Because the income ceiling doesn't factor into RMDs, Roth conversions and rollovers, a lot more people can qualify. On the other hand, the Roth 401(k) has no income limitations that you need to deal with. However, you need to be aware that Roth 401(k)s are eventually subject to RMDs.

364,RMD,"Additional Strategies
"
365,RMD,"Consolidate and Plug Your RMD Hole 
"
366,RMD,"It is almost a certainty that an individual working into his or her 70s will have multiple IRAs and other types of retirement plans floating around. As a result, those floating accounts will be forced to make annual RMD withdrawals. If that same individual owns less than 5% of the business he or she is working for and the plan administrator allows it, this person could roll over any existing IRAs and retirement plans into his or her current employer's plan. This is true as long as the individual has not separated from service and is still working. 
"
367,RMD,"Once the individual successfully rolls over the existing assets into the employer's plan, he or she should be relieved of having to take annual RMDs from those assets. The wild card in this scenario is almost always the plan document and administrator. If everything is copacetic and you are able to reduce your RMDs while you are working, you will have the opportunity to create room for doing a Roth conversion or the relief of evening out your tax burden until you fully retire.
"
368,RMD,"State Income Tax ""Filter"" 
"
369,RMD,"While it depends on the state in which you live and file your taxes, some states that impose a state income tax provide more favorable tax treatment to individuals who make contributions to and take distributions from IRAs and other qualified plans. In Illinois for example, the government doesn't add your 401(k) contributions back into your state income calculation; it also allows residents to subtract most distributions from IRAs and qualified plans from income.
"
370,RMD,"""State tax filter"" loopholes do exist because states want to encourage their residents to stay in-state and not jump ship for no-income-tax states like Florida or Texas when they retire. That said, the loophole can be a noose if you work in a state like Pennsylvania and then retire to a state like California. In that situation, you can get taxed on the way in and the way out. How you incorporate these existing loopholes into your savings strategy will depend on your goals and your particular set of circumstances, including your CPA's advice!
"
371,RMD,"Example - Taking RMDs From a Roth 401(k)
"
372,RMD,"An individual who could take a look at this strategy is someone who is more than 70 years old, is self-employed and is making contributions to a Roth 401(k). In this case, if you alter your savings strategy by contributing to a pretax 401(k) and converting an outside IRA instead, you might be able to reduce your state income tax burden and avoid having to take RMDs from your Roth 401(k), which is an after-tax account.
"
373,RMD,"The Bottom Line
"
374,RMD,"The working crowd over 70 still has the ability to save and defer taxes through Roth IRAs and qualified plans that don't exist for their retired peers. By incorporating these and other tools into their overall strategy, the nearly retired may be able to legitimately reduce their overall tax burden to a targeted beneficiary. However, the targeted beneficiary for retirement plans isn't always the contributor, so each individual's strategy should take into account that individual's specific goals as well as the surrounding facts and circumstances. Any individual attempting to take advantage of these strategies needs to be aware that the rules surrounding their implementation are complicated and the laws can change overnight. At the end of the day, any plan incorporating these or similar types of strategies should only be executedafter receiving sound advice from a qualified tax professional in consultation with your retirement plan administrator.The rules of the game may change when you hit the milestone age of 70 1/2, but the fruits of putting money into a retirement account are not out of your reach until you formally and fully retire.

After all is said and done, the net result for the individual would be a $21,000 deduction. The point here is that the opportunity to save is not drastically diminished because you have to make RMDs while you are working. Winner by Disqualification: Pretax 401(k)Roth IRA vs. Roth 401(k) If you are over 70 1/2 and you are working, you will have the ability to contribute to both types of accounts. While the income restrictions governing who can contribute to a Roth IRA can be difficult to overcome, it isn't impossible. The reason it isn't impossible involves how the income ceiling for the contribution is determined. Because the income ceiling doesn't factor into RMDs, Roth conversions and rollovers, a lot more people can qualify. On the other hand, the Roth 401(k) has no income limitations that you need to deal with. However, you need to be aware that Roth 401(k)s are eventually subject to RMDs.Winner for Easiest Contribution Category: Roth 401(k)Overall winner and Winner of the Final Destination Category: Roth IRA Additional StrategiesConsolidate and Plug Your RMD Hole It is almost a certainty that an individual working into his or her 70s will have multiple IRAs and other types of retirement plans floating around. As a result, those floating accounts will be forced to make annual RMD withdrawals. If that same individual owns less than 5% of the business he or she is working for and the plan administrator allows it, this person could roll over any existing IRAs and retirement plans into his or her current employer's plan. This is true as long as the individual has not separated from service and is still working. Once the individual successfully rolls over the existing assets into the employer's plan, he or she should be relieved of having to take annual RMDs from those assets. The wild card in this scenario is almost always the plan document and administrator. If everything is copacetic and you are able to reduce your RMDs while you are working, you will have the opportunity to create room for doing a Roth conversion or the relief of evening out your tax burden until you fully retire.State Income Tax ""Filter"" While it depends on the state in which you live and file your taxes, some states that impose a state income tax provide more favorable tax treatment to individuals who make contributions to and take distributions from IRAs and other qualified plans. In Illinois for example, the government doesn't add your 401(k) contributions back into your state income calculation; it also allows residents to subtract most distributions from IRAs and qualified plans from income.""State tax filter"" loopholes do exist because states want to encourage their residents to stay in-state and not jump ship for no-income-tax states like Florida or Texas when they retire. That said, the loophole can be a noose if you work in a state like Pennsylvania and then retire to a state like California. In that situation, you can get taxed on the way in and the way out. How you incorporate these existing loopholes into your savings strategy will depend on your goals and your particular set of circumstances, including your CPA's advice!Example - Taking RMDs From a Roth 401(k)An individual who could take a look at this strategy is someone who is more than 70 years old, is self-employed and is making contributions to a Roth 401(k). In this case, if you alter your savings strategy by contributing to a pretax 401(k) and converting an outside IRA instead, you might be able to reduce your state income tax burden and avoid having to take RMDs from your Roth 401(k), which is an after-tax account.The Bottom LineThe working crowd over 70 still has the ability to save and defer taxes through Roth IRAs and qualified plans that don't exist for their retired peers. By incorporating these and other tools into their overall strategy, the nearly retired may be able to legitimately reduce their overall tax burden to a targeted beneficiary. However, the targeted beneficiary for retirement plans isn't always the contributor, so each individual's strategy should take into account that individual's specific goals as well as the surrounding facts and circumstances. Any individual attempting to take advantage of these strategies needs to be aware that the rules surrounding their implementation are complicated and the laws can change overnight. At the end of the day, any plan incorporating these or similar types of strategies should only be executedafter receiving sound advice from a qualified tax professional in consultation with your retirement plan administrator.

401,RMD,"Baby boomers planning for their retirement face unprecedented financial challenges. Unlike retirees of past generations who could rely on Social Security and employer pension plans for guaranteed income, baby boomers will likely be on their own when it comes to income generation and must rely on their savings to provide much of their retirement income. Prior to retirement, the focus is on wealth accumulation, but when retirement rolls around a fool-proof plan must be devised to ensure accumulated wealth is effectively managed to finance the entire retirement. 
"
402,RMD,"In this article we'll explore how traditional, safe income generating strategies may not be enough for the latest crop of retirees, and we'll look at some alternative methods to help baby boomers generate sufficient income throughout retirement.
"
403,RMD,"How Much Is Enough?
"
404,RMD,"With the lack in traditional sources of guaranteed retirement income, boomers find themselves with the need to turn their savings into income that lasts throughout retirement. To accomplish this goal, boomers must determine the answers to two key questions:
"
405,RMD,"How Much Income Will You Need?
"
406,RMD,"It would be easy to answer this question if you could see into the future to learn how long you will live, your health status for the rest of your life and how the economy and inflation will behave during your retirement. Unfortunately, there is no way to answer these questions with absolute certainty. As such, you must implement a plan based on assumptions and suppositions. Many financial planners estimate that you will need retirement income of about 75% to 100% of your pre-retirement income to maintain your pre-retirement standard of living . This, coupled with longer life expectancies, means that you will need more than previous generations to finance your retirement. For instance, In you and your spouse both retire at age 65 and need your retirement savings to pay $50,000 per year for roughly 20 years. You will need $1 million at retirement to provide sufficient income over the 20-year period.
"
407,RMD,"How Can You Generate This Income?
"
408,RMD,"One key step is to work with a financial planner to determine your projected retirement income needs. Social Security and pension plans used to provide a base level of retirement income that you could count on. Boomers are the first generation to see these safety nets fade away, and new creative solutions need to be found, which could include devoting more of your retirement portfolio to stocks or establishing an annuity. Another factor to consider is inflation, which can erode the purchasing power of your savings over time. Let's say you retire on an income $50,000 per year. If the rate of inflation averages only 3% per year, after 20 years, you will need $90,500 to buy what $50,000 buys today. If inflation averages 5%, the number increases to $132,500. As such, any practical financial plan for retirement must take inflation into consideration.
"
409,RMD,"Implementing Your Plan
"
410,RMD,"While it may be tempting to allocate all of your savings toward providing your projected retirement income needed for each year, you should designate some of your savings to cover contingencies. Throughout your lifetime, there will be circumstances, both expected and unexpected, that require funds over and above your usual income needs. Some of your savings should be earmarked to cover such expenses, so as not to stifle the flow of your regular income needs.
"
411,RMD,"How to Maximize Your Income
"
412,RMD,"Maximizing income from your savings will help to ensure that you are able to finance your retirement needs and wants. Contrary to popular belief, retirement is not a period where you should eliminate risk within your investments. Investing all of your savings in low-return vehicles such as money market accounts and certificates of deposit (CD) minimizes risk to principal, but there are two things to consider:
"
413,RMD," Income from these ""safe"" assets may not keep pace with inflation.
"
414,RMD," You may begin to spend principal too early during your retirement, and outlive your assets if insufficient income is generated. 
"
415,RMD,"Stocks have historically outpaced inflation by a significant margin and have provided the strongest return on investment over the long term, so consider keeping a portion of your savings invested in stocks and stock mutual funds throughout your retirement. Also, think about adding (or keeping) preferred stock, which almost always carries a dividend to provide income.
"
416,RMD,"Investing some of your savings in an annuity may also be beneficial. Many insurance companies offer variable and equity-indexed annuities with an income rider that provides a guaranteed lifetime income withdrawal benefit and the opportunity to grow your remaining principal within the annuity. In addition, you can make withdrawals from the principal if needed.
"
417,RMD,"Minimizing Risks
"
418,RMD,"Investments with the potential for high returns usually have high risk of loss. If these assets, such as stocks, are included in your portfolio, it is important that you minimize the risk of losing your savings. One way to do so is to diversify your investment portfolio so that it includes a reasonable amount of growth and income producing assets to balance your investments among high-, medium- and low-risk investments. Your financial planner may recommend different strategies, depending on your investment profile.
"
419,RMD,"Reducing Taxes
"
420,RMD,"Taxes can eat into your income and cause your net income to be much less than anticipated. While your retirement projections must include provisions for taxes, you can take steps to reduce the amount you will owe. Here are few ideas to help minimize tax and its impact. 
"
421,RMD," Avoid putting most of your savings in low-paying fixed-interest vehicles such as money market accounts and certificates of deposit (CD), as they're not very efficient income producing investments. If you need the interest from these investments for income, you can probably get a better rate of return from other investments. Unless the investments are held in tax-deferred accounts, you will pay taxes the year the interest is earned, reducing your net earnings. Consider that the after-tax return on a CD paying 5% interest is essentially cut to 4.25% if you're in the 15% income tax bracket and 3.75% if you're in the 25% tax bracket.
"
422,RMD," Consider an immediate annuity as an income producing alternative. Say you have $100,000 that you want to invest for income. If you invest it in a CD paying 5%, your net after-tax return is only $3,650, presuming you're in the 27% income tax bracket ($100,000 x 5% = $5,000 x 27% = $3,650). Instead, you could invest the money in an immediate annuity, which would pay you $7,545 per year for the rest of your life ($100,000 = $7,870/year - $6,666 exclusion = $1,204 taxable income x 27% income tax = $7,545 net income/year).
"
423,RMD," Take small distributions from your individual retirement account (IRA). If you are like most people, you have two types of savings: one type that has already been taxed (after-tax money) and another that has not yet been taxed (pretax money). Some financial advisors may recommend spending your pretax money first and preserving the after-tax savings. This recommendation is usually made if you will be in your lowest tax bracket during the years the distributions occur; however, if the bulk of your saving will be spent during the earlier years of your retirement, it may make sense to withdraw the after-tax amounts during those periods so as to reduce the tax impact. In other cases, a financial advisor may recommend that you withdraw a little from each. The key is to ensure that your withdrawal strategy is one that will result in the lowest possible tax liability.
"
424,RMD," Consider converting some of your Traditional IRA assets to a Roth IRA if you are eligible to do so. Earnings on Roth IRA assets are tax-free if qualified, and there is no required minimum distribution (RMD) amounts. 
"
425,RMD,"Example: Traditional IRA vs. Roth IRA 
"
426,RMD,"Suppose you own a $300,000 Traditional IRA and you also have $90,000 in regular savings. Let's assume everything grows at exactly 10% per year, and your tax bracket is at the 30% rate. 
"
427,RMD," The Traditional IRA will generate income in the amount of $30,000 annually. The income tax due on that distribution would be roughly $9,000, resulting in net income of $21,000. The savings also generate 10% income, or $9,000 per year. After taxes, the net income is $6,300. So the total annual net income will be $27,300 from these accounts.
"
428,RMD," If the $300,000 were converted to a Roth IRA, the tax owed would be about $90,000 or the value of the entire savings account for the year the conversion occurs. However, the $30,000 income from the Roth IRA would be income tax free. 
"
429,RMD,"Thus, the $300,000 Roth IRA generates $30,000 net income while the $300,000 Traditional IRA coupled with an additional $90,000 from savings provides an income, net after taxes, of $27,300.  
"
430,RMD,"The Bottom Line
"
431,RMD,"Baby boomers planning for retirement will be confronted with financial challenges that are much different than those of their predecessors. With the shift from defined-benefit plans to defined-contribution plans, and the uncertain future of social security, boomers are on their own when it comes to financing retirement.

457,RMD,"DENISE APPLEBY
"
458,RMD,"If you are married and file a joint tax return, your federal tax rate may be lower than that of an unmarried individual. In fact, many areas of U.S. tax law are written to provide married couples with greater benefits than those received by other individuals - the same is true for retirement plans, which offer several perks for those who have tied the knot. In this article, we highlight some of the unique benefits available to married couples.
"
459,RMD,"Using Your Spouse's Income To Fund Your IRA
"
460,RMD,"One of the eligibility requirements for making a contribution to an IRA is that you must have taxable compensation. However, an exception is made for a married individual who files a joint tax return if his or her spouse has taxable compensation. For this purpose, the spouse who has taxable compensation is allowed to make a spousal IRA contribution to the IRA of the spouse who has no taxable compensation, commonly known as the non-working spouse.

462,RMD,"Inheriting Your Spouse's Retirement Benefits
"
463,RMD,"A retirement account owner can generally designate any party as the beneficiary of his or her retirement account. However, in certain cases, if the account owner is married, his or her spouse must consent to the designation if the spouse is not the sole primary beneficiary of the retirement account. This ensures that your spouse does not designate someone else to receive death benefits from his or her retirement accounts without your approval. Such spousal protection is offered for the following types of retirement accounts:
"
464,RMD,"If your spouse has assets in a qualified plan account, he or she is required to designate you as the sole primary beneficiary. Plan administrators will generally not accept beneficiary designations unless the spouse is the sole primary beneficiary or consents to an alternate designation, and the consent must be witnessed by a notary public or a plan representative.
"
465,RMD,"IRAs for Residents of Community/Marital Property States
"
466,RMD,"If an IRA owner lives in a community or marital property state, spousal consent is generally required if the IRA owner designates any party other than his or her spouse as the primary beneficiary of the IRA. Community property states are Alaska (residents may elect to have their property treated as such), Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas and Washington; Wisconsin is the only marital property state.
"
467,RMD,"Notes
"
468,RMD,"Community property is generally defined as property acquired during the marriage. 
"
469,RMD,"If you reside in a community property state and you plan on getting married and do not want to designate your new spouse as the beneficiary of your pre-marriage IRA, you may want to keep your pre-marriage and post-marriage IRA assets separate. 
"
470,RMD,"Inherited IRAs are usually not defined as community property, and spousal consent may not be required to designate someone other than your spouse as primary beneficiary.

472,RMD,"Prevention of Distributions without Spousal Consent
"
473,RMD,"Quite often, retirement plan participants deplete their retirement assets without the knowledge of their spouses. This can be a devastating revelation to a spouse who was counting on those funds to finance the couple's retirement years. If the assets are in a defined-benefit, target-benefit or money-purchase pension plan, depletion of those assets is unlikely to occur without the spouse's knowledge, because they are generally required to be distributed in the form of a qualified joint and survivor annuity (QJSA), unless the participant and the spouse consent in writing to receive distributions in another form. 
"
474,RMD,"Exceptions apply to assets that are required to be distributed from the plan, including excess contributions, required minimum distributions and amounts that can be cashed out without the participant's consent. In most cases, amounts can be cashed out without the participant's consent if his or her accrued balance under the plan is $5,000 or less. 
"
475,RMD,"While the QJSA rules always apply to all defined-benefit, target-benefit and money-purchase pension plans, this is not the case for profit-sharing and 401(k) plans. Instead, the QJSA rules apply to these plans only if the plan is designed to include those options. Some profit-sharing and 401(k) plan documents, such as prototypes, are designed to allow employers to elect whether they want the plan to be subject to the QJSA rules.

"
478,RMD,"If the retirement account owner dies before the required beginning date (RBD):
"
479,RMD,"Distribute the assets over your life expectancy. (Note: If there are multiple beneficiaries for the retirement account, the life expectancy of the oldest beneficiary is used, unless the assets are split into separate accounts by December 31 of the year following the year the owner dies. If the split occurs by then, each beneficiary may use his or her own life expectancy.) Distributions must begin by December 31 of the year following the year the retirement account owner dies.

"
488,RMD,"You can roll over the amount to your own IRA or other eligible retirement plan and need not begin distributions until you reach age 70.5. In this case, distributions would be based on the uniform life table, which assumes that you have a beneficiary not more than 10 years your junior, or the joint life expectancy table if you remarry someone more than 10 years younger than you are.

"
749,RMD,"You can ignore it if you want, but sooner or later the dreaded RMD is coming to get you — and your tax dollars. So young or old, you might as well review some key points.Rules for required minimum distributions (RMDs) apply to owners of traditional IRAs and to those who inherit them and Roth IRAs. Whether you are 20 or 70, certain retirement strategies let you avoid costly missteps.For IRA owners, RMDs start after age 70-1/2. One day's difference can mean a year's tax deferral.Say a hypothetical Ed Bass was born on June 30, 1943. He will be 70-1/2 in December 2013. Ed must start RMDs by April 1 of the following year: 2014.If Ed's pal Dan Lee was born on July 1, 1943, he won't be 70-1/2 until 2014. So Dan doesn't have to start RMDs until April 1, 2015.You can take more than the RMD if you want. But any shortfall draws a 50% penalty. To calculate the RMD, use the IRS uniform lifetime table. If your IRA beneficiary is your spouse who is more than 10 years younger, use the joint-life-and-last-survivor expectancy table. That leads to a smaller RMD.Your IRA custodian will calculate the RMD each year or on request.Let's go back to Ed Bass. He must take an RMD by next April. That's his 2013 RMD, based on his year-end 2012 balance. Say that amount was $100,000.In 2013, Bass had his 70th birthday. The uniform lifetime table shows that at age 70 Bass has an expected life span of 27.4 years. Dividing $100,000 by 27.4, Bass must withdraw at least $3,650 by next April to avoid a 50% penalty.After the first April deadline, future RMDs must be taken by each Dec. 31. So Bass must take a second RMD, using his 2013 year-end balance and his age-71 life expectancy, by Dec. 31, 2014.On this schedule, Bass takes two RMDs in 2014. If he fears this will push him into a higher tax bracket, he can take his 2012 RMD in 2013 instead of waiting until next April.Inherited IRAsIRA beneficiaries have different RMD rules. Spouses can roll over the account to their own name and act as an IRA owner.Nonspouse beneficiaries who want to take RMDs typically start by Dec. 31 of the year after death.Say Ann Coe inherited an IRA from her mother, who died in 2012. Coe must start RMDs by Dec. 31, 2013. If Coe is 35 in 2013, her life expectancy is 48.5 on the single life table. She divides 48.5 into the IRA's balance on Dec. 31, 2012.If the balance was $120,000, Coe's 2013 RMD is $2,474. Going forward, Coe's RMDs will be the succeeding year-end IRA balances divided by 47.5, 46.5 and so on.Roth IRA owners don't have RMDs. But Roth IRA beneficiaries do, and they follow the above rules.Distributions from inherited Roth IRAs usually are tax-free. But the 50% fine applies to skipped RMDs.You can aggregate some RMDs. If you have an $8,000 RMD from one IRA this year and a $7,000 RMD from another, you can take $15,000 from either or both of them.But you can't count part of your withdrawal as your spouse's RMD. ""Each IRA owner must take his or her own RMD yearly,"" said IRA expert Ed Slott. If one spouse withdraws an amount equal to their combined RMDs, for instance, the other spouse will owe a 50% a penalty for any RMD not taken from his or own account.RMDs from an IRA inherited from one decedent can't be combined with any other RMDs. And Roth and traditional IRA RMDs can't be aggregated.
