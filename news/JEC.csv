The small-cap index's lag could be a stain on the market's bounce because small-caps tend to participate in bottoming moves.Volume was sharply lower compared with Friday's trading. That suggests a lack of institutional investors trying to keep the rebound going. But breadth was comforting, with advancers over losers by 7-to-2 on the NYSE and by 17-to-9 on the Nasdaq.Energy, airline, steel and mining stocks were some of the ones spearheading the advance.

2,JEC,"Stocks opened to narrow losses Friday, then reversed into tight gains as the major indexes fought to add a sixth day to their rebound rally before heading into the holiday weekend.X The Dow Jones industrial average backed out of a fractional loss and gained 0.1%. The S&P 500 dipped 0.1%, then battled to a fractional gain.

Coca-Cola (KO) popped 1% to take an early lead after its fourth-quarter results cleared estimates and full-year guidance topped expectations. Coke's shares recovered nearly 4% this week, seeking to regain support and trading about 8% below their Jan. 26 high.Apple opened down 0.3%, but quickly reversed to a 0.4% gain. Five sessions of mostly strong-volume gains have hoisted the stock back above its 50-day moving average, and turned its Relative Strength line from a negative to a positive indicator.

The IBD 50 leader reported late Thursday its earnings were stronger than expected in the fourth quarter, but revenue only narrowly topped targets and the company's first-quarter outlook disappointed investors. The stock had punched 13% higher for the week through Thursday. The opening pullback stopped just short of the stock's 10-week moving average.Other stocks taking hard premarket hits following earnings included Cognex (CGNX), down 5%, Yamana Gold (AUY), down 8% and LogMeIn (LOGM), down 7%.RELATED:Auto Parts: Road To Recovery Lined With Ice, Aging Cars and AmazonApple's Stock Chart Improves, These 2 Tech Names Tumble LateThe Big Picture: Stocks Charge AheadWednesday's The Big Picture: The Market Outlook Has Changed AgainSolar Power Firm, Bermuda Bank Among Stocks Topping Buy PointsUsing The 50-Day Line For New Buying OpportunitiesLeading China Names Begin Year Of The Dog In Race To Form Bases

8,JEC,"It's time to take a brief break from Donald Trump. Whatever you think of him, there's no denying that he dominates the news cycle. We seem to assume that the nation's future depends on Trump's fate, for better or worse. The reality is otherwise: The nation's future also hangs on larger economic and social trends that no president can shape.A new report from the congressional Joint Economic Committee (JEC) reminds us of this. The report examines the nation's ""social capital."" Now, social capital is an obscure academic term that, essentially, signifies the ability of people to work and play together — to cooperate and connect with others. The stronger a society's social capital, the less isolated and powerless people feel. The news here is cautionary; our social capital is depleting.The JEC study assessed social capital in four realms — family life, the workplace, religion and community — and found it weakening in all four. Here's a brief summary of the report's conclusions, which are based on scholarly studies and public opinion surveys.The institutions that provide social stability and personal contentment seem to be in retreat. The fact that one-third of children are raised by single parents cannot be good. Neither is the loss of confidence in major institutions. As private institutions weaken, pressure mounts on government to fill the void, but the effect is to place more demands of government than it can meet, contributing to its unpopularity.Remember, however, that some of these changes have also created huge benefits. Women's entrance into the paid labor force has both raised household incomes and provided satisfying careers for millions. We must also guard against exaggerating adverse effects. The JEC study reports that parents still spend the same amount of time with their children as before, despite the pressures of balancing work and family. Similarly, one study shows that some types of volunteering have increased since the 1970s.Perhaps slightly faster economic growth and higher wages would alleviate some social and economic tensions. But economic growth is not a panacea for all our problems and worries. Indeed, paradoxically, greater wealth and affluence are the causes of some of our discontents, as the JEC report acknowledges.""The increases in dual-income and single-parent families reflect the rising affluence of our nation, not growing hardship,"" it says.""Technological innovation reduced the amount of time it took to maintain homes. ... Even the growth in single parenthood reflects rising affluence. More women are able to support children on their own ... due to their increased earnings. So too, the public safety net for single parents, while by no means allowing a lavish existence, is sufficiently generous to facilitate single parenthood.""
"
9,JEC,"To some extent, the future of America depends on Donald Trump. But it depends even more on how these social and economic trends evolve — how we cope with them and whether we become a more cohesive society or a more contentious one. Trump is not destiny. For better or worse, we are.

10,JEC,"President Trump's visit to Saudi Arabia will be a busy one for the oil sector as General Electric (GE), Schlumberger (SLB), Baker Hughes (BHI) and Halliburton (HAL) are expected to announce deals with Saudi Arabia's state run oil company, according to a Bloomberg report.Saudi Aramco is expected to sign the deals on Saturday. The report also said deals were expected with KBR Inc. (KBR), Jacobs Engineering (JEC), Nabors Industries (NBR), Weatherford International (WFT), McDermott International (MDR) and Rowan Companies (RDC).GE shares fell 2.25% to 27.41 on the stock market today, a fresh 15-month low Schlumberger dipped 0.5%, Baker Hughes fell 0.1% and Halliburton fell 0.9%, with crude oil futures up 0.8%. (General Electric is merging oil and gas assets with Baker Hughes.)Last month, Schlumberger CEO Paal Kibsgaard said he was worried about global underinvestment but said that investments in the Middle East and Russia ""will remain resilient"" though activity won't really start to accelerate until 2018.The flurry of deals come as Aramco looks put nearly 5% of its company up for sale in an initial public offering next year. Lower oil prices have put a damper on the IPO, and the kingdom is looking at alternative means of revenue outside oil and gas to fund the government.Defense giants could also be big winners during Trump's visit, as more than $100 billion in arms sales are expected, including a Lockheed Martin (LMT) air-defense system and laser guided bombs from Raytheon (RTN).Lockheed shares fell 0.9% to 269.24, dropping just below a 270.10 buy point.

18,JEC,"Days after the inauguration, President Donald Trump's impact on the stock market was atop the minds of investors and financial advisors who gathered in Hollywood, Fla., for the 10th annual Inside ETFs conference.At a roundtable titled ""Where To Invest In 2017,"" which helped to kick off Monday's sessions, ""Trump ETFs"" became the shorthand for the best investment ideas in the year ahead. Invest in steel, ships and railroads — and more broadly in the U.S. defense industry, said Dennis Gartman, editor and publisher of the Gartman Letter and an expert in the commodities and capital markets.""Don't overthink this,"" Gartman advised an audience comprised of financial advisors and investors. ""Mr. Trump has proposed investing in infrastructure, investing in the military. Those are going to be easy bets.""Moderator Bob Pisani, the ""On-Air Stocks"" editor at CNBC, asked the panel of experts about the specific ""Trump ETFs"" that could benefit from the new U.S. president's focus on tax cuts and fiscal spending. Their responses included the following three exchange traded funds:Andrew Lapthorne, another panelist at the roundtable and head of quantitative research at Societe Generale, said a fairly robust U.S. economy was likely to be pumped up further through fiscal stimulus. But he cautioned that American corporations are more leveraged than they have ever been and valuations are extremely high.""For me, the biggest risk of the Trump administration is how (Fed Chair Janet) Yellen responds"" to his policy moves, he added.On the sidelines of the ETF conference, Bill Belden, managing director at Guggenheim Investments, described some of his firm's products as belonging to the camp of ""Trump ETFs"" too.RSP's stock holdings should benefit from lesser regulation, the generally more favorable business climate and higher support for domestic manufacturing (under Trump), he added.""That yield focus has really been beneficial"" to its performance, he added, pointing out that most of the stock holdings have long-term government contracts and, as a result, tend to generate consistent and stable cash flow streams. It has a 4.3% distribution yield vs. 2.94% for iShares Global Infrastructure (IGF), one of the largest infrastructure ETFs.Panelists at the morning's roundtable also discussed how to construct a Trump-focused ETF portfolio given the outlook for the U.S. dollar, bond yields and the volatility index. The four-day event concludes Wednesday.RELATED:High-Yield Strategy Uses 10 ETFs To Provide All-Weather Income With Low Risk

19,JEC,"You might not have heard of or read much about the company Argan (AGX). This year, IBD's Stock Spotlight column featured it twice in August. But you probably know its bigger peers in the heavy construction industry.That said, Argan has taken the big dog role in the group this year.The stock perked up June 8, one day after the Rockville, Md., firm reported outstanding results for the fiscal first quarter ended in April. Profits leapt 62% to 81 cents a share, marking one of the biggest increases in recent years, as revenue bulged 52% to $130.3 million.That large top-line increase represented acceleration from a 14% increase in the prior quarter that ended in January. Revenue fell vs. year-ago levels in the two quarters before that.These numbers help explain Argan's sterling 98 Earnings Per Share Rating and an A grade for SMR (Sales + Profit Margins + Return on equity), both available at IBD Stock Checkup.Argan shares gapped up sharply on June 8, finishing up more than 16% in the heaviest volume in almost six months. That move ignited a run past 40, where the stock had been bumping its head for months. It then became an acceptable price area in which to buy the stock. If you traced a cuplike pattern going back to late November, then a valid buy point emerged at 40.20 — 10 cents above the Nov. 20 intraday high.That high served as the left-side lip of the cup base.Argan has since rallied nearly 49%. An investor at the breakout could have decided to take gains at 20% to 25% -- a key rule in IBD-style growth investing and could be called the ""platinum rule"" -- or simply held because shares have yet to test support at the key 50-day moving average.Argan plays an important role for electric power producers, providing engineering, infrastructure and construction services. It boasts expertise in not only helping to construct natural gas-powered plants but also biomass-powered energy facilities, solar farms, wind farms and biofuel plants.Argan's market cap of $896 million (share price of 59.74 multiplied by 15 million shares outstanding) is a fraction of the giants in the heavy construction group.Meanwhile, shares in Fluor (FLR) (No. 1 in market cap at $7.2 billion), have been dull this year. A nice rally in the first quarter of 2016 melted fast in early May, when the heavy construction giant posted disappointing first-quarter results (EPS down 11%, revenue down for the 11th quarter in a row).The second biggest name in the 22-company group, Jacobs Engineering (JEC) ($6.3 billion in market cap), has fared much better. In late April, the stock cleared a 44.87 handle buy point within a long choppy base and have rallied as much as 24.5%. Even then, Jacobs commands a mediocre Composite Rating of 69. Argan, Wildan Group (WLD), Goldfield (GV) and Sterling Construction (STRL) are the only stocks with a Composite of 90 or higher out of a maximum 99. The latter three are thinly traded or below 10 a share.Argan on Sept. 15 announced an annual cash dividend of 70 cents a share, payable Oct. 28 to shareholders of record as of Oct. 18. That gives the stock a modest dividend yield of 1.2%, below the 2% figure for the S&P 500. However, this time Argan is tossing an extra 30 cents per share to holders as a special one-time cash payout.CEO Rainer Bosselmann noted in a news release that success in completing the Panda power plant projects in Pennsylvania encouraged the company's board to approve the extra dividend.Keep in mind that in the heavy construction industry, results can be lumpy — especially for a smaller player. Argan has seen a decline in yearly sales in four of the past seven fiscal years. For now, revenue is seen climbing 55% to $176.7 million in the October-ending third quarter.RELATED:You Know The Golden Rule Of Selling; How About The Platinum Rule?Who Ranks Highest In Earnings Growth Among Engineering And Heavy Construction Firms?

26,JEC,"Growth: The president keeps congratulating himself on how the economy's doing, and Hillary Clinton just gave her former boss an 'A' for his handling of the nation's finances. Who said inflation was under control?The latest revised numbers for GDP growth through the third quarter of 2015 tell us that we are still stuck in a 2% growth rut and real middle class wages are still flat-lining.Meanwhile, another new report from Sentier Research based on Census data finds that median household income of $56,700 at the end of 2015 stood exactly where it was, adjusted for inflation, at the end of 2007.That's eight years of virtually zero income gain. And Obama and his Washington pals wonder why voters are in such a cranky mood.Last week, the Joint Economic Committee of Congress issued a new report on the Obama recovery that's loaded with even more bleak news.On almost every measure examined, the 2009-15 recovery since the recession ended in June of 2009 has been the meekest in more than 50 years.Start with the broadest measure: growth in output. The chart with this editorial compares the Obama growth pace with that of the average recovery coming out of the last eight recessions, and with the Reagan recovery, and over the same number of months (77).Democrats used to disparage the Reagan expansion as nothing special. Yet the growth rate over the first 25 quarters under Reagan was 34%, vs. 14.3% under Obama.How much does this matter? If we had grown at an average pace, GDP in 2015 would have been about $1.8 trillion higher. Under the Reagan recovery, growth would have been $2.7 trillion higher.It is certainly true that every recession is different in cause and consequences, so the JEC dug deeper into the numbers. It examined GDP growth on a per capita basis.The Reagan recovery was abnormally strong in part because it happened as millions of baby boomers were swept into the workforce, adding to growth.But even on a per capita basis, real GDP has grown only 9% vs. 18.8% for the average recovery. That is the lowest of any post-1960 recovery. The growth decline in this key gauge of living standards is alarming.Next, the JEC measured job market trends. Again we see a failing record. Yes, official unemployment of just over 5% today is very low.But that's because 94 million people in America over the age of 16 aren't in the labor force. Labor force participation rates have fallen sharply for working age Americans. If job growth had been the same as in the average recovery, we would have 5.9 million more Americans working.Amazingly, if we had had a Reagan-paced job recovery, we would today have at least 12 million more Americans working. That's more people than in the labor force of Michigan and Indiana combined.When business investment is weak, fewer people work. Wages and family incomes remain stagnant.That's the sorry story of the Obama era.And it was no accident, by the way. It's the result of policy moves by the Democrats, who controlled Congress completely from 2006 to 2010, by President Obama, who has been in office since 2009, and by the Federal Reserve. All operated on the mistaken notion that more government, not less, would fix things.The trillion-dollar stimulus of 2009, Dodd-Frank financial reforms, an $8 trillion surge in federal debt, ObamaCare, higher taxes on those who work, and an ongoing regulatory siege that has pushed the number of federal rules to an all-time high — all contributed to the epic slowdown in economic growth that plagues our nation.As for the Fed's quantitative easing — under which the central bank printed more than $3.5 trillion in new money as ""stimulus"" — and 0% interest rates, they were also a bust for growth.If Obama's recovery had been just average — in other words a C grade — JEC calculates that ""after-tax per-person income would be $3,339 (2009 dollars) per year higher."" That's about $278 a month per person in missing income.This lack of growth is especially bad for those at lower incomes. Not only can they not climb the ladder of opportunity in a stagnant, slow-growth economy, but a substantial number actually fall back into poverty.The poverty rate as of the end of 2014 — the last full year for which data are available — was 14.8%. That's higher than in 1966, the year President Lyndon Johnson's ""War on Poverty"" went into effect.President Obama's economic policies share a major part of the blame for that — and for Americans' growing sense that something's gone very wrong in our country.The JEC's dreary conclusion tells the whole sad story of the era of Obamanomics in one brief line: ""On economic growth, the Obama recovery ranks dead last.""Dead last. Americans can feel the effects of this squeeze when they pay their bills each month at the kitchen table, and when their paycheck doesn't stretch so far when they shop at the local store.For the record, last place isn't an A grade. It's closer to an F. If this is the record that presidential candidate Hillary Clinton wants to run on, by all means, let her.

29,JEC,"Economy: Time was, they had fact-checkers at the White House. They must've had the weekend off when President Obama let go a whopper at a Labor Day rally in Milwaukee.'By almost every measure,"" he boasted, ""the American economy and American workers are better off than when I took office."" This must explain why nearly half of American workers believe the U.S. is still in a recession.Sure, the stock market's done well and employment has picked up, but the most important indicator of their financial situation is whether take-home pay keeps pace with inflation. And by this measure most households are falling behind.Median household income, according to the Census Bureau, is down by more than $2,000 in real terms since Obama moved into the Oval Office in January 2009 and has dropped $1,600 since the recession officially ended five months later.One big reason household incomes have stalled is that labor force participation has fallen by 3 percentage points, representing an added 7 million Americans not even seeking employment. When people don't work, their income falls effectively to zero.This vaunted recovery is half the normal pace in terms of job creation and GDP growth, according to a report from the Republicans on the Joint Economic Committee of Congress. JEC also reports this is the weakest rebound from a recession since the Great Depression.We are 5 million jobs below where the president's economic team told us we would be when they sold on the snake oil of a $830 billion fiscal stimulus plan.After 5-1/2 years in the White House, Obama has added almost $7 trillion in debt with little to show for it — unless you count 46 million Americans on food stamps as an accomplishment.Obama claims he has a plan to put the economy back to work. ""I'm not asking for the moon. I'm asking for policies that help folks get ahead. ... Republicans running Congress are opposed to them,"" Obama said Monday.The last time we looked, Democrats and Harry Reid still ran the Senate, and that's been the graveyard of economic growth policies. Reid won't even allow votes on the Keystone pipeline, corporate tax reform, medical-device tax repeal, a repatriation holiday to bring $1 trillion to $2 trillion of capital locked overseas back to America or an end to the ObamaCare 30-hour-a-week rule for full-time employment, to name just a few.The president is angry that House Republicans oppose raising the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour.But how is that going to help financially squeezed middle-class families? Only about 5% of workers earn the minimum. Most of the remaining 95% are running on a financial treadmill.What Obama covets is that rubber stamp he had in the first two years of his presidency — a stamp that approved ObamaCare, the stimulus, tax increases on investment, Dodd-Frank, cash for clunkers, bail-outs and a grand expansion of the welfare state.Actually, he is asking for the moon, and the quickest way to tank the economy again is for voters to give it to him.

32,JEC,"This week, President Trump asked his administration to find another $200 billion worth of goods to impose tariffs on. Moreover, the Senate voted to re-instate a ban on U.S. component sales to Chinese firm ZTE, undoing the government’s agreement with Beijing to save the firm.But while ZTE was a one-firm affair, the threat of additional sanctions had Chinese people pulling their money out of the stock market, sending Chinese markets down and setting off a chain reaction elsewhere, including in the U.S.The White House figures that it can increase the pressure because of China’s dependence on the U.S. in key growth sectors. But whether the new threat constitutes real actions or negotiating rhetoric is anyone’s guess. Especially since the President hasn’t limited his standoff to China, but taken the fight to the world.So after the President removed the steel and aluminum tariff exemptions, the EU decided to impose tariffs on $3.2 billion worth of American goods like bourbon, peanut butter and Harley-Davidson motorcycles to counter the 25% and 10% tariffs on European steel and aluminum, respectively.The tariffs go into effect on Friday. Its goal is to bring maximum harm to Republican states, ignoring the President’s threat that counter sanctions will have it targeting European cars next.Mexico’s retaliatory tariffs announced earlier this month affect another $3 billion worth of American goods including a 20% tariff on U.S. pork legs and shoulders, apples and potatoes and 20-25% duties on cheeses and bourbon and a host of other items, again with the goal of bringing maximum harm to southern states. While Trump’s economic advisor Larry Kudlow hinted at bilateral deals to replace the NAFTA, both Canada and Mexico are against it. So there’s another stalemate.Even India, which is a much smaller trading partner, has proposed additional tariffs of up to 50% on above 800cc motorcycles targeting Harley-Davidson as well as lower rates on 29 other categories including things like almonds, walnuts and fresh apples, lentils, certain iron and steel goods and boric acid to offset the impact of steel and aluminum tariffs on the global market. India is more important as a defense market because it is the fourth largest defense spender with an underdeveloped domestic market, enabling the U.S. to grow into the third largest supplier, after Russia and Israel.Whatever the plan, whether actual or rhetorical, one thing the government has managed to achieve is increase the uncertainty on Wall Street. Which is why this is a good time to jump into some safe-haven stocks-Using Zacks methodology, we can identify stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) recommendation that cater to attractive industries (studies have shown that the top 50% of Zacks Ranked Industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1), have a VGM Score of A or B (indicating universal appeal because value, growth and momentum investors would find them equally attractive), A Value Score of A or B (indicating that they are undervalued) and an expected long term (3-5 year) growth rate of over 10%.

34,JEC,"KBR, Inc.’s (KBR  -  Free Report) global government services business, KBRwyle, recently secured a seat on a multi-award contract by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Engineering Research and Development Center.Per the contract, KBRwyle has been selected as one of the six prime contractors on the $900 million indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contract, under which the company is entitled to provide rapid solutions for fixing problems identified through the Department of Defense's (DoD) Joint Test and Evaluation (JT&E) Program.This 10-year, cost-plus-fixed-fee contract also allows KBRwyle to assist the JT&E program in finding options for U.S. warfighters to achieve their missions. Moreover, KBR will also have the chance to bid on task orders issued by the JT&E Program Offices to address and resolve critical warfighter issues.KBR Banking on Government Services BusinessesThe company’s Government Services segment, accounting for more than 65% of its total revenues, has been performing pretty well. The segment performed impressively in the last reported quarter, driven by organic growth and new award wins from the U.K. Ministry of Defence, U.S. Air Force and Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division. The division’s revenues rose an impressive 31.5% year over year to $677 million. Further, the company expects growth across all key markets in the United States, UK and Australia on account of continued opportunities across the lifecycle of its projects.Recently, KBRwyle secured a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract modification from the Army Contracting Command. Per the deal, KBR will offer base life-support services to the U.S. Army throughout Iraq, supporting the Operation Inherent Resolve. Estimated revenues related to this one-year task order modification will be booked as unfilled orders in the Government Services business segment’s backlog. (Read more: KBR Secures Modification Contract From ACC to Support OIR).Share Price PerformanceKBR, a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock, has a robust inorganic strategy in place for expanding its market share. In this regard, the company completed the Stinger Ghaffarian Technologies (“SGT”) and the Aspire buyouts in April. These additions are in sync with its strategies to expand high-tech professional services across the Government Services sector and have helped the stock to gain 4.4% in the past three months, outperforming the industry it belongs to.The company remains optimistic about the prospects of both the buyouts, mainly on account of increased government spending across space and defense. We believe such strategic buyouts will likely give a major boost to KBR’s top line, going ahead.Other Key PicksOther top-ranked stocks in the same space include Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. (JEC  -  Free Report), Quanta Services, Inc. (PWR  -  Free Report) and Gibraltar Industries, Inc. (ROCK  -  Free Report).Jacobs Engineering Group holds the same rank as KBR. Its earnings are expected to grow 31.5% in 2018. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Quanta Services’ earnings are expected to grow 41.6% in 2018.

35,JEC,"AECOM (ACM  -  Free Report) recently announced that its joint venture with Aecon and SNC-Lavalin secured a Fuel Channel and Feeder Replacement (FCFR) contract from Bruce Power at the Bruce Nuclear Generating Station, located in Kincardine, Ontario. Valued at CAD 475 million, the joint venture will perform its work under Shoreline Power Group. Notably, AECOM’s interest in the deal will be booked in its backlog in third-quarter fiscal 2018.This project falls under Bruce Power’s Major Component Replacement (MCR) program - Unit 6, a part of its Life-Extension Program, which will enable Bruce Power’s units to operate safely through to 2064. Notably, under the MCR program, Unit 6 is the first of six reactors to be refurbished by Bruce Power.Work related to the deal will include removal and replacement of calandria tubes, pressure tubes and feeders, construction management as well as trade labor. The project is scheduled to start in June 2020 and expected to be completed in 2022.Separately, the joint venture also entered into a Preferred Supplier Agreement with Bruce Power. Per the terms of the agreement, Bruce Power will be able to award similar contracts to this joint venture for the remaining five units under the MCR Program.Our TakeAECOM has a diversified portfolio that comprises both designing and construction services. In addition, the company’s business is spread across a number of key markets that mitigates operating risks. It is also efficient in dealing with cyclical market volatility, which helps AECOM capitalize on upside of the company’s business during downturns. Currently, over 70% of AECOM’s profits are generated from infrastructure and defense markets that are poised to benefit from the favorable political climate both in the United States and abroad.In a year’s time, shares of AECOM have returned 3.3% compared with the industry’s increase of 0.4%. Moreover, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is witnessing robust prospects in all of its segments. Evidently, all three segments of AECOM performed impressively in the fiscal second quarter, with strong growth in building construction and steady improvement in Americas design business. Meanwhile, the Construction Services and the Management Services segments continue to benefit from higher margin work in the building construction businesses. At the end of the fiscal second quarter, the company registered an all-time high backlog of $50 billion. The company’s solid backlog levels, which are a key indicator of revenue growth, reflect significant opportunities in the forthcoming quarters.However, cyclical demand for the company’s services and currency fluctuations are likely to thwart growth moving ahead. Also, lower capital spending on part of major clients remains a major concern for AECOM. This apart, volatility in the oil and gas market, with declining prices and spending levels, has been hurting the company’s projects and orders.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the same space are Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. (JEC  -  Free Report), KBR, Inc. (KBR  -  Free Report) and Quanta Services, Inc. (PWR  -  Free Report). All these three companies carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Also, the top-line figure came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4,785 million.Moreover, AECOM achieved 5% organic growth in the quarter, which marked the sixth successive quarter of positive organic growth. Strength in the company’s transportation and water markets as well as continued strong performance of its Building Construction business drove the top line.Segment-wise, Design & Consulting Services (DCS) revenues rose 7.3% year over year to $2,004.7 million. On a constant-currency basis, organic revenues increased 5% backed by strong performance at the company’s transportation and water markets in the Americas. This impressive performance can be attributed to improved funding and a strong backlog position.Construction Services (CS) revenues were up 9% to $1,888.3 million on a year-over-year basis. On a constant-currency basis, organic revenues rose 4%. Solid performance of this segment was driven by Building Construction businesses.Management Services (MS) revenues registered a year-over-year increase of 8.6% to $897.8 million. On an organic basis, the metric grew 9%, reflecting stellar performance across its portfolio of projects.AECOM Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise AECOM Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | AECOM QuoteHowever, AECOM’s adjusted operating income in the quarter under review amounted to $179 million, down from the year-ago tally of $188.5 million. New order wins in the quarter totaled $6.9 billion. The company’s total book-to-burn ratio was 1.4%, with significant contribution from all its three segments.At the end of the fiscal second quarter, AECOM’s total backlog was at an all-time high of $50 billion, up 18%, reflecting a favorable mix shift to the higher-margin DCS and MS segments. This included a solid backlog position in the DCS segment and the MS segment.Liquidity & Cash FlowAs of Mar 31, 2018, AECOM’s cash and cash equivalents summed $867.2 million compared with $802.4 million as of Sep 30, 2017.As of Mar 31, 2018, total debt (excluding unamortized debt issuance cost) came in at $3,999.1 million compared with $4,261.5 million on Mar 31, 2017. AECOM generated free cash flow of $94.7 million in the reported quarter.2018 GuidanceAECOM reiterated its fiscal 2018 guidance. The company continues to expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.50-$2.90.In terms of spending, the company continues to expect interest expenses (excluding amortization of deferred financing fees) of $210 million and capital expenditures of $110 million for 2018.Our TakeIncrease in the proportion of higher margin work is benefiting AECOM’s Construction Services segment and Management Services segment. Moreover, the Shimmick buyout is supplementing core revenue growth. Going ahead, the company remains confident that favorable political climate will continue to unlock growth opportunities in infrastructure and defense markets.Moreover, the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company’s solid backlog levels, which are key indicators of future revenue growth, reflect significant opportunities in the forthcoming quarters. This apart, transportation investment remains healthy and the company is delivering several large projects. Overall, it can be said that the global consensus toward the need for substantial infrastructure investments might boost the company’s performance.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other stocks worth considering from the same space include Dycom Industries, Inc.

38,JEC,"Per the latest report from U.S. Commerce Department, domestic construction spending ticked up in May on the back of a sturdy increase in investments in private as well as public construction projects.Although, the metric came in below market expectations, it showed a steep rise on a year-over-year basis. Such an increase points toward strength in the construction market despite trade war related woes. Investors should make the most of this opportunity and bet on stocks from the space.U.S. Construction Activity Gains TractionConstruction spending in the United States ticked up 0.4% in May. This came in lower than the consensus estimate of an increase of 0.5%. However, the spending on construction projects across the United States increased 4.5% in May to an all-time high of $1.31 trillion.However, the data for April was revised down to 0.9% instead of 1.8% reported earlier. This would have been the biggest increase in the last 24 years. Experts speculated that a downward revision in April data could lead to economists reducing their second quarter GDP growth forecast even further.However, the Atlanta Federal Reserve stated on Jul 2 that it expects the U.S. economy to grow at an annualized pace of 3.8% in the second quarter compared with 2% in the first quarter.Outlays on Private and Public Construction Drove Spending HigherThe uptick in May was supported by a steady increase in outlays on private as well as public construction projects. The total investment in private construction rose 0.3% last month. Further, investments in residential projects alone rose 0.87% in May.Also, spending shot up 0.6% on new single-family homes and 1.6% on apartment construction. On the other hand, investment in public construction rose 0.7% in May to $304.1 billion — its highest level since October 2010. What contributed to such an increase was a 0.6% rise in state and local construction projects to $282.1 billion. This marked its biggest increase since 2009.Moreover, outlays on state and local construction constitutes about 90% of the total government spending, thereby providing the biggest push to overall government spending. Taking such factors into consideration, a faction of economists believe that construction spending would end up propelling the overall economic growth of the United States this year even as interest rates remain high.4 Best ChoicesDespite the prevalent trade war-related worries, construction activity in the United States remained robust in May. Increased spending on public as well as private construction resulted in an uptick in overall construction spending.The Zacks Construction sector is currently placed in the top 38% out of the 16 Zacks sectors.

39,JEC,"KBR Inc. (KBR  -  Free Report) recently announced that its government services business, KBRwyle, has secured a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract modification from the Army Contracting Command (ACC). Per the deal, KBR will offer base life support services to the U.S. Army throughout Iraq, supporting the Operation Inherent Resolve (OIR). Estimated revenues related to this one-year task order modification will be booked as unfilled orders in the Government Services business segment’s backlog.Notably, the ACC exercised third option year on the task order while awarding this modification deal. The original task order was awarded in December 2014, under the Logistics Civil Augmentation Program (LOGCAP) IV contract.KBR will continue to cater to the logistical requirements of the Army’s deployed forces, according to the contract. The company will also provide its support services, including power generation, firefighting and morale, welfare, and recreation (MWR). Furthermore, it will offer waste and facilities management that include custodial, post office, laundry, food and water, vector as well as pest management services. This apart, KBR is likely to be responsible for supervising fuel handling and airfield operations at military sites located in Erbil, Al Asad, Taji, Al Taqaddum, Al Bashur and Q-West.Existing Business ScenarioKBR is banking on the strength of its Government Services businesses to optimize its growth potential. In fact, this particular business is growing steadily, which is a positive for the company. During the first quarter of 2018, the segment performed impressively driven by organic growth and new award wins from the U.K. Ministry of Defence, the U.S. Air Force and the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division. Further, the company expects growth across all its key markets in the United States, the UK and Australia on account of continued opportunities across the lifecycle of projects.Meanwhile, KBR remains optimistic about backlog growth in the early 2018 owing to the pipeline of opportunities. Also, the company’s consulting business is experiencing increased activity in the past few quarters backed by more efficient reutilization and strong pricing environment. Additionally, an increasing portfolio of smaller and OpEx-facing projects, services, program management and maintenance contracts give the company a stronger foundation compared with the previous years. The company believes that healthy balance between hydrocarbons and government projects positions it well for future growth.In a year’s time, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company’s shares have gained 25% against the industry’s decline of 1.4%. KBR also looks for acquisitions and strategic alliances for bolstering its inorganic growth and expanding market share, which is encouraging. In this regard, the company recently completed the SGT and the Aspire buyouts. It remains optimistic about the prospects of both the buyouts mainly on account of increased government spending across space and defense. We believe such strategic buyouts should supplement KBR’s top-line performance, going ahead.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other top-ranked stocks in the same space include Quanta Services, Inc.

40,JEC,"AECOM (ACM  -  Free Report) recently announced that Savannah River Remediation LLC — a joint venture led by AECOM — has secured a liquid waste management contract extension from the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) Savannah River Operations Office in Aiken, SC. Valued at $450 million, this contract extension is effective from Jun 1, 2018 to Mar 31, 2019. Notably, the value of this deal will be booked in AECOM’s backlog in second-quarter fiscal 2018.Per the deal, Savannah River Remediation will provide services including operation of the Defense Waste Processing Facility and Saltstone Processing Facility. Also, this AECOM-led joint venture will work on the progress of the Tank Closure Cesium Removal demonstration and construction project as well as the construction of Saltstone Disposal Unit 7. Notably, the company’s comprehensive experience in liquid waste disposition will help in managing the radioactive waste system at the site safely, thus reducing the area’s environmental risk.Existing Business ScenarioAECOM has been witnessing robust prospects across all of its business segments. Evidently, all three segments of the company performed exceedingly well in the fiscal second quarter, with strong growth in building construction and steady improvement in Americas design business. Meanwhile, increase in the proportion of higher margin work in building construction businesses is benefiting AECOM’s Construction Services and Management Services segments. Further, the company’s solid backlog levels may lead to solid revenue growth in the forthcoming quarters. Moreover, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s diversified portfolio comprises both designing and construction services. Also, its business is spread across a number of key markets that mitigates operating risks. Moving ahead, the company remains confident that favourable political climate will continue unlocking growth opportunities of the infrastructure and defense markets, which generate more than seventy percent of its profits. In a year’s time, shares of AECOM have gained 4% against the industry’s decline of 0.9%.However, volatility in the oil and gas market with declining prices and contracting spending levels has been hurting the company’s projects and orders. In addition, cyclical demand for AECOM’s services and currency fluctuations are likely to thwart growth moving ahead.

42,JEC,"Dycom Industries Inc. (DY  -  Free Report) broke its earnings beat streak of eight quarters, as it missed estimates in first-quarter fiscal 2019. The company continues to face multiple headwinds, which have affected its performance over the past few months. We anticipate high operating expenses, poor contribution from acquired businesses as well as pronounced seasonal fluctuations to thwart growth in the upcoming quarters as well. Mirroring these headwinds, the company also lowered its guidance for fiscal 2019.It’s not surprising that the stock has also put up a dismal show in recent times. In the past six months, Dycom has lost 14% compared with the industry’s decline of 6.4%. Let’s delve deeper to find the major factors curbing this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company’s growth and why it might be prudent to avoid the stock at the moment. Factors to ConsiderDycom’s margins are prone to suffer due to timing volatility, customer spending modulations and an adverse mix of work activities. Moreover, massive promotional expenditures and cut-throat pricing competition are plaguing the U.S. telecommunications industry. Also, severe spectrum crunch coupled with gradual Smartphone and tablet adoption is compelling wireless operators to seek other options for raising revenues. In the meantime, the highly dynamic telecommunication industry continues to experience rapid technological, structural and competitive changes. This, in turn, might reduce the service requirements from Dycom and adversely impact its financial performance.Furthermore, Dycom’s business is likely to be significantly impacted by inclement weather conditions as a major part of its work is done outdoors. Therefore, extended periods of adverse weather might hurt the company’s earnings during the winter, especially in the second and third quarters of fiscal 2019. Earlier, pronounced seasonal impact from Dycom’s acquired businesses and the costs related to initiations of large customer programs have hurt its bottom line significantly and might continue in the upcoming quarters as well.Notably, Dycom derives a significant portion of its revenues from master service agreements and long-term contracts, which may be cancelled at the discretion of customers. For instance, the company’s first-quarter fiscal 2019 contract revenues came in at $731.4 million, down 7% year over year. The decline was primarily due to moderation in spending by one of the company’s important customer as well as revenue declines from certain other customers. Also, revenues from its top five customers declined 8.8% organically, while the same from all other customers decreased 14.2% organically. This apart, the highly competitive in nature of the specialty services contract industry in which Dycom operates is concerning.Considering the above-mentioned risks that the company faces, we believe it would be apt for investors to avoid the stock for now.Stocks to Consider Some better-ranked stocks from the same space are MasTec, Inc. (MTZ  -  Free Report), KBR, Inc. (KBR  -  Free Report) and Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. (JEC  -  Free Report). While MasTec sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), KBR and Jacobs Engineering carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

46,JEC,"Investors looking for stocks in the Engineering - R and D Services sector might want to consider either Jacobs Engineering (JEC  -  Free Report) or Chiyoda Corp. Unsponsored ADR . But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.Currently, Jacobs Engineering has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Chiyoda Corp. Unsponsored ADR has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). Investors should feel comfortable knowing that JEC likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than CHYCY has recently. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use.JEC currently has a forward P/E ratio of 15.48, while CHYCY has a forward P/E of 24. We also note that JEC has a PEG ratio of 1.07. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. CHYCY currently has a PEG ratio of 2.40.Another notable valuation metric for JEC is its P/B ratio of 1.55. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, CHYCY has a P/B of 1.61.These metrics, and several others, help JEC earn a Value grade of A, while CHYCY has been given a Value grade of F.JEC sticks out from CHYCY in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that JEC is the better option right now.

48,JEC,"Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. (JEC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 (ended March 2018) results on May 8, before the market opens.The company pulled off an average positive earnings surprise of 11.40% over the last four quarters. Notably, Jacobs’ fiscal first-quarter 2018 adjusted earnings of 77 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 67 cents.Our proven model shows that the company will likely beat estimates in the quarter under review.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Jacobs has the right combination of the two key ingredients.Zacks ESP: Jacobs currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.34%. This is because the stock’s Zacks Consensus Estimate of 88 cents is a penny lower than the Most Accurate estimate.Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. QuoteYou can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Jacobs’ favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), when combined with a positive Earnings ESP, predicts a likely earnings beat.Per our proven model, a stock needs to have a combination of a positive Earnings ESP, and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 or at least 3 (Hold), for a likely earnings beat.However, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Ranks #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.What’s Driving the Stellar Earnings?Elevated infrastructure spending in the United States and some major emerging economies, like China, is expected to spur demand for Jacobs’ premium engineering and construction management services over the long run.Though no specific financial guidance has been provided for the fiscal second quarter, Jacobs’ expectation for the fiscal will give a rough idea of the factors that might have influenced results in the to-be-reported quarter.The company expects that elevated defense spending in major economies like the United States, new organic investments, bolt-on acquisitions, superior customer relationships and sturdier demand for state-of-the-art technology solutions will boost revenues of Aerospace & Technology line of business (LOB).Additionally, increasing public investments in worldwide transportation and water infrastructure, as well as business prospects in the healthcare market are anticipated to drive top-line performance of the company’s Buildings & Infrastructure LOB in the near term.Moreover, the company believes revenues of its Industrial LOB will go up in the upcoming quarters, on the back of improved life science, semiconductor, and mining & minerals businesses.Furthermore, amid the lackluster energy market, Jacobs expects that efforts to strengthen its downstream chemicals and refining business will likely drive revenues of the company's Petroleum & Chemicals LOB.Stellar top-line performance of the aforementioned segments, greater cost management, restructuring moves, reduced corporate taxes and timely project delivery are expected to have reinforced the company’s bottom-line performance in the quarter.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some stocks in the Zacks Construction sector that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Fluor Corporation (FLR  -  Free Report) carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has an Earnings ESP of +0.63%.

The improvement in revenues were supported by the execution and substantial completion of task order awards for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in Puerto Rico. New awards in the quarter totaled $43 million.Diversified Services revenues increased 13% to $643.3 million on a year-over-year basis, reflecting growth in revenues from Stork operations in Latin America and North America.

In the reported quarter, the segment booked new awards of $721 million.Mining, Industrial, Infrastructure & Power segment's revenues recorded a decline of 33.7% year over year to $910.3 million, reflecting lower volume of project execution activities in power.  New awards came in at $1.3 billion including a mine expansion project in Peru.In the reported quarter, Fluor's total new awards recorded an increase of 9.6% to $2.5 billion on a year-over-year basis.At the end of the reported quarter, consolidated backlog was $29.1 billion, down from $41.6 billion in the year-ago quarter.Liquidity & Shares RepurchasesAs of Mar 31, 2018, Fluor had cash and marketable securities (including non-current) of $1,828.5 million, down from $2,078.8 million as on Dec 31, 2017.

For 2018, it currently projects earnings per share in the range of $2.10-$2.50 compared with its previous guided range of $3.10-$3.50.Our TakeFluor’s leading position in nuclear remediation at government facilities bodes well for its future growth. The company also anticipates an increase in front-end engineering awards, moving ahead, which is expected to boost growth. Moreover, the company’s investment projects are encouraging, particularly its LNG projects in North America, including the LNG Canada project for Shell, chemical facilities as well as pipeline projects in the United States.Moreover, the company enjoys a solid track record of receiving awards, and management remains optimistic about continuation of this trend in future as well.

50,JEC,"KBR, Inc. (KBR  -  Free Report) has secured a contract from GS Caltex Corp. to supply its proprietary Selective Cracking Optimum Recovery (SCORE) Ethylene Technology.Per the contract, KBR will supply its advanced SCORE technology license and basic engineering design services for GS Caltex’s 700 KTA ethylene mixed feed cracker. GS Caltex, a company owned by GS Energy and U.S.-based Chevron Corp. (CVX  -  Free Report), will build the new plant and use naphtha, liquefied petroleum gas and refinery off-gases as its main feedstocks.The project, to be built in the South Korean southern city of Yeosu, will use KBR's highly selective SC-1 furnaces for the highest yield and flexibility.KBR is the leading olefin plant designer, and construction and technology developer. The company’s SCORE technology is highly flexible, and enables producers to boost the bottom line through superior yield, energy, and operational performance.With the help of KBR's cost-effective cracking technologies and flexible plant designs, 20 new ethylene plants, with a combined capacity of 13 million metric tons per year, have been brought on-stream since 1990.Selective opportunities in the downstream petrochemical and ethylene projects, and a growing number of small-scale LNG projects in North America are expected to boost the growth of hydrocarbons. The company believes that a healthy balance between hydrocarbons and the government projects positions it markedly for future growth.Notably, Hydrocarbons Services revenues declined 40.1% year over year in the first quarter of 2018. Reduced activity on several projects across the sector dented the segment’s prospects. The recent contract is expected to enable the company offset the downward trend and boost revenues. Nonetheless, KBR is optimistic about backlog growth through 2018, primarily owing to work in consulting areas.Late last month, KBR    secured a contract from DuPont Safety & Construction — a business unit of DowDuPont Specialty Products Division — to expand the production capacity of Tyvek nonwoven materials. Estimated revenues associated with this contract will be booked into the backlog of unfilled orders for KBR's Hydrocarbons Services Business Segment in the second half of 2018. These contracts are expected to aid the company offset the weak top-line scenario of KBR's Hydrocarbons Services business segment.Price PerformanceYear to date, KBR’s shares have declined 10.4% compared with the industry’s decline of 17.1%. Going forward, KBR expects broad-based growth in all the segments, which is expected to reflect in its share price. Primary growth drivers of the company include high-end and differentiated government services work, strong margin performance, as well as technology and consulting. Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, KBR carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the same sector are Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. (JEC  -  Free Report) and Altair Engineering Inc. (ALTR  -  Free Report).

53,JEC,"Fluor Corporation (FLR  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 3. In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings came in at 70 cents per share, reflecting a beat of 11.1%.We expect Fluor to score an earnings beat in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Fluor is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because the stock has the right combination of two ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen. This is perfectly the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Fluor has an Earnings ESP of +2.28% as the Most Accurate estimate of 82 cents is pegged higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 81 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Fluor Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Fluor Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Fluor Corporation QuoteZacks Rank: The company carries a Zacks Rank #2, which when combined with a positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Ranks #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Factors Driving Better-Than-Expected ResultsOver the past few quarters, Fluor’s market diversity has remained a key strength and has allowed the company to mitigate the cyclicality of markets in which it operates. In addition, this premium engineering and construction firm’s long-term prospects remain strong backed by existing growth opportunities in renewable energy, gas-fired combined cycle generation and air emissions compliance projects for current coal-fired power plants. Fluor also continues to be optimistic about its investment projects, particularly the LNG projects in North America.Furthermore, the company has a strong track record of receiving awards, which is anticipated to prove conducive to bottom-line growth in the to-be-reported quarter as well. Meanwhile, Fluor continues to receive awards for FEED and pre-FEED work for gold, bauxite and copper projects. Based on these present trends, the company expects to secure two major EPC mining projects in the next few quarters.Fluor also remains optimistic about its end markets, including mining. Within the Energy, Chemicals & Mining segment relative stability in commodity prices are likely to boost investments in downstream, petrochemicals and mining. Additionally, commercial markets, including life sciences and infrastructure, are likely to improve going forward. Robust pipeline of work in North America and Europe are expected to be favourable for the company’s Diversified Services business. Further, the company has grown its maintenance, fabrication and construction capabilities as well as invested in its systems and processes that are expected to improve its project delivery.Given this backdrop, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues from the company’s Industrial, Infrastructure and Power segment remains high at $1,050 million, reflecting growth of 4.7% sequentially. Also, the company’s healthy level of backlog in infrastructure, government, life sciences and advanced manufacturing should continue driving profitable growth.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Louisiana-Pacific Corporation (LPX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.37% and a Zacks Rank #1.

54,JEC,"Quanta Services, Inc. (PWR  -  Free Report) is slated to release first-quarter 2018 results before the opening bell on May 3.The company's earnings surprise history is decent, with two beats and two misses in the trailing four quarters. In the last reported quarter, the company reported earnings of 45 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.3%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to Consider  Quanta Services remains optimistic about the prospects of its end markets in both of its segments namely, Electric Power and Oil & Gas segments, over the next couple of years. Particularly, the company’s communications infrastructure services business seems to be performing brilliantly. Of late, the company is actively pursuing opportunities with various U.S. telecom and cable MSOs. With the larger diameter pipeline market expanding, and a multi-year cycle ahead of it, the company remains optimistic about its communications infrastructure services operations.Moreover, Quanta Services’ oil and gas segment outlook looks promising primarily owing to the improving mainline and natural gas distribution and integrity markets. Moving ahead, the company continues to expect healthy levels of base load work, including supporting midstream infrastructure, downstream support services and natural gas distribution. Additionally, it anticipates strong performance from pipeline projects driven by a considerable increase in large pipeline revenue contributions amid an active bidding and negotiating environment.Further, the company’s decentralized and entrepreneurial business model allows it to combat challenges that arise from a bleak macroeconomic scenario. Also, Quanta Services enjoys strong prospects in end markets supported by key growth drivers like an aging grid, shifting generation mix and grid modernization. These factors are expected to prove conducive to the company’s top line going ahead.Meanwhile, the company remains optimistic about its solid backlog levels, which are likely to grow further. This apart, its recent bolt-on acquisitions are anticipated to boost top-line growth in the quarter under review and beyond.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Quanta Services in the to-be-reported quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Quanta Services has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 32 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Quanta Services, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Quanta Services, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Quanta Services, Inc. QuoteZacks Rank: The company carries a Zacks Rank #2, which increases the predictive power of the ESP. However, its ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.As it is we caution against stocks with a Zacks Ranks #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies that you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Fluor Corporation (FLR  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +2.28% and a Zacks Rank #2.

55,JEC,"Nearly an hour before its release, President Trump tweeted that he was “looking forward” to May’s jobs data. Ultimately, the report was able to live up to investors’ expectations, heightened primarily by Trump’s comments. The unemployment rate declined to the lowest level witnessed since April 2000. Job additions also increased substantially.May’s jobs report has successfully dispelled concerns about slowing jobs growth. Retail trade led job gains, followed by healthcare and construction. With job gains likely to continue in the months ahead, picking stocks from these sectors looks like a prudent option at this point.Unemployment Lowest Since April 2000The unemployment rate declined from 3.9% in April to 3.8% in May, the lowest in 18 years. The U6 unemployment rate that includes people forced into part-time work and people only sporadically looking for jobs declined to 7.6%, the lowest level witnessed since May 2001.The decline in the unemployment rate was also attributable to a marginal fall in the labor participation rate, which declined from 62.8% to 62.7. However, economists now think that unemployment can decline further since 60.4% of the U.S. population is still unemployed. Since this is still lower than pre-recession levels, the slack in the labor market prevails.Meanwhile, average hourly earnings increased by 0.3%, or 8 cents to $28.92 an hour. Consequently, wages increased by 2.7% year over year in May. This is particularly significant since the metric remained unchanged at 2.6% for three consecutive months. The average workweek remained flat at 34.5 hours.Retail Trade, Healthcare, Construction Lead GainsThe economy added 223,000 jobs in April, exceeding the consensus estimate of 190,000. This was the largest number of job additions in three months. Notably, monthly job additions have averaged 191,000 over the past one year. Job additions for March and April were revised upward by a combined 15,000.At the forefront of job gains were healthcare and construction. These sectors added 29,000 and 25,000 jobs, respectively. However, leading the pack was the retail trade sector which added 31,000 jobs. The sector has added 125,000 jobs in the past 12 months.Our ChoicesThe decline in the unemployment rate indicates the extent to which the labor market has tightened. This is also probably why job additions have declined to a pace lower than what was witnessed earlier this year. However, most economists think job additions will continue and that the unemployment rate will decline further.Retail trade, healthcare and construction have been the highest recruiters according to the May jobs report. Adding stocks from these sectors looks like a smart choice at this point. However, picking winning stocks may be difficult.This is where our VGM Score comes in. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners.

57,JEC,"Investors with an interest in Engineering - R and D Services stocks have likely encountered both Jacobs Engineering (JEC  -  Free Report) and Chiyoda Corp. Unsponsored ADR . But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.Jacobs Engineering and Chiyoda Corp. Unsponsored ADR are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #3 (Hold) respectively, right now. This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that JEC is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use.JEC currently has a forward P/E ratio of 15.23, while CHYCY has a forward P/E of 23.68. We also note that JEC has a PEG ratio of 1.06. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. CHYCY currently has a PEG ratio of 2.37.Another notable valuation metric for JEC is its P/B ratio of 1.52. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, CHYCY has a P/B of 1.58.Based on these metrics and many more, JEC holds a Value grade of A, while CHYCY has a Value grade of F.JEC is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook, which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model. And, based on the above valuation metrics, we feel that JEC is likely the superior value option right now.

58,JEC,"AECOM (ACM  -  Free Report) recently announced that its wholly owned subsidiary, JT4 Limited Liability Company, has clinched a 15-year contract from the U.S. Air Force. This cost-plus-award-fee contract, worth $3.1 billion, is likely to be completed by Apr 15, 2033. Notably, the value of this deal coupled with earlier deals in the services sector, will be booked in AECOM’s backlog in third-quarter fiscal 2018.Per the contract, JT4 Limited Liability Company will provide the U.S. Air Force with joint range technical services for operating, maintaining and sustaining the western test and training ranges. Work related to the deal will be executed at the 412th Test Wing and the Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division in California, the Nevada Test and Training Range, the Utah Test and Training Range as well as the Space Test and Training Range in Colorado.Our TakeAECOM’s diversified portfolio comprises both designing and construction services. Also, its business is spread across a number of key markets that mitigate operating risks. In fact, more than 70% of the company’s profits are generated from the infrastructure and the defense markets that are poised to benefit from the favorable political climate in the United States and abroad. The global consensus toward the need for substantial infrastructure investments is expected to act as primary growth driver.Moreover, AECOM is witnessing robust prospects in all of its segments. The Construction Services and the Management Services segments continue to benefit from higher margin work in the building construction businesses. Furthermore, the company’s solid backlog levels, which are a key indicator of future revenue growth, reflect significant opportunities in the forthcoming quarters. In a year’s time, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has gained 1.3%, against the industry’s decline of 0.7%.However, volatility in the oil and gas market along with declining prices and contracting spending levels has been hurting AECOM’s projects and orders. This apart, cyclical demand of the company’s services and currency fluctuations are likely to thwart growth, moving ahead.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the same space are KBR, Inc. (KBR  -  Free Report), Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. (JEC  -  Free Report) and Quanta Services, Inc. (PWR  -  Free Report). All these companies carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

59,JEC,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. (JEC  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Jacobs Engineering has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 18.1, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 20. If we focus on the stock’s long-term PE trend, the current level puts JEC’s PE ratio above its midpoint over the past five years with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months.However, the stock’s PE also compares pretty unfavorably with industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 15.3. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively overvalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that JEC has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of 14.9, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for the stock in the near term.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Jacobs Engineering has a P/S ratio of about 0.8. This is a bit lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.3 right now.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, JEC currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes JEC a good choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.What About the Stock Overall?Though Jacobs Engineering might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of C and a Momentum score of C. This gives JEC a Zacks VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of B. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging. The current quarter has seen five estimates go higher in the past 30 days and none lower, while the full year estimate has also seen six upward revisions and none downward revisions in the same time frame.As a result, the current quarter consensus estimate has increased 10.2% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has dropped by about 6.2%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. Price and Consensus Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. Price and Consensus | Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. QuoteThis positive trend signifies bullish analyst sentiment, and its Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) indicates robust fundamentals and expectations of outperformance in the near term.Bottom LineJEC is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its good lineup of statistics on this front. With a good industry rank (Top 12% out of more than 265 industries) Jacobs Engineering looks like a strong value contender. However, over the past one year, its industry has clearly underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:Despite the poor past performance of the industry, a good industry rank signals that the stock is likely to benefit from favorable broader factors in the immediate future. Add to this the positive estimate revisions and robust value metrics, and we believe that we have a strong value contender in Jacobs Engineering.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

Reduced activity on several projects across the sector played spoilsport for the segment.Also, Technology revenues recorded a decline of 6% year over year to $62 million.KBR is changing the name of the Engineering & Construction segment to the Hydrocarbons Services segment. Moreover, the company has shifted the Consulting division, previously reported in the Technology and Consulting segment, to the Hydrocarbons Services segment.

The company currently expects adjusted earnings per share in the band of $1.35-$1.45 per share.This guidance excludes legal costs associated with legacy U.S. Government contracts and acquisition & integration-related expenses related with the Aspire and SGT acquisitions. The estimated legacy legal fees exclude any future cost reimbursement from U.S. Government.KBR currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to Consider Some better-ranked stocks in the same space include Willdan Group, Inc.

61,JEC,"Chicago Bridge & Iron Company N.V.  reported first-quarter 2018 adjusted earnings of 43 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 40 cents by 7.5%. Also, the metric jumped a whopping 79.2% on a year-over-year basis due to successful cost-reduction initiatives and strong operational execution.Inside the HeadlinesChicago Bridge & Iron posted quarterly revenues of $1,745.6 million, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,781.2 million. The top line also declined 4.5% year over year. This lackluster performance was largely a result of revenue declines across two of the company’s segments.Gross profit rose 14.7% year over year to $173.1 million, while gross margin expanded 170 basis points (bps) to 9.9%. The improvement in margins was driven by a steep year-over-year decline in cost of revenues.Operating income increased 36% year over year to $107.7 million, driven by improved performance in the Engineering & Construction segment and cost-reduction efforts. Operating margins expanded 190 bps to 6.2%.The company booked new awards worth $1,133.4 million in the quarter compared with $2,796.1 million in the prior-year quarter. The company stated that the year-over-year decline was caused by the timing of the new award activity. Chicago Bridge & Iron Company N.V. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Chicago Bridge & Iron Company N.V. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Chicago Bridge & Iron Company N.V. QuoteSegmental RevenuesThe company’s revenues from its Engineering & Construction segment came at $1,365.4 million, up 6.6% from the prior-year quarter’s figure, owing to increased activity on various projects in the U.S. New awards in this segment totaled $664.9 million in the quarter under review, reflecting a sharp decline compared with its value of $2,236.2 million in the year-ago quarter. This was largely due to the timing of the new award activity.Fabrication Services quarterly revenues totaled $262.7 million, down 37.9% year over year. New awards received by this segment amounted to $310.9 million at the end of the first quarter, compared with $339.1 million in the year-ago quarter.Meanwhile, revenues from the Technology segment fell 5.1% and came in at $117.6 million.LiquidityChicago Bridge & Iron’s cash and cash equivalents at quarter end came in at $305.2 million compared with $420.1 million in the year-ago quarter. Net cash used in operating activities in the quarter came in at $240.3 million, lower than $290.7 million recorded in the comparable period last year.Major DevelopmentsIn December 2017, Chicago Bridge & Iron and McDermott (MDR  -  Free Report) agreed to merge in an all-stock deal worth about $6 billion, thus creating an extensive engineering, procurement, construction and installation company. The combined company will be completely vertically integrated and is likely to offer end-to-end engineering, procurement, construction and installation services to the onshore and offshore energy sectors. The agreement is expected to close in the second quarter of 2018.Notably, the deal is expected to be cash-accretive (excluding one-time costs) within the first year after its closure. In 2019, the companies are expected to generate annualized cost synergies of $250 million and sizeable revenue synergies in addition to Chicago Bridge & Iron’s $100-million cost-reduction program.McDermott primarily focuses on offshore operations, while Chicago Bridge & Iron's strength is in onshore projects. The deal will integrate two highly complementary businesses and create a leading onshore-offshore EPCI (engineering, procurement, construction and installation) company, with immense scale and diversity to capitalize on global opportunities. The deal is on track to conclude in May 2018.To ConcludeChicago Bridge & Iron projects multiple opportunities in its key end markets including the United States, East Africa and the Middle East. For the United States and Middle East, solid petrochemical investment on ethylene and low feedstock cost are projected to fuel growth.Moreover, the company’s comprehensive corporate and operating cost-reduction program, which includes non-personnel and discretionary cost reductions as well as personnel-related reductions, is estimated to generate savings of about $100 million annually.However, the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company’s margins remain vulnerable to increasing costs on IPL and Calpine power projects and execution of its other projects.Stocks to ConsiderA few better-ranked stocks in the same space include Potlatch Corporation (PCH  -  Free Report) and Jacobs Engineering Group Inc.

62,JEC,"AECOM (ACM  -  Free Report) recently announced that it has signed a five-year partnership agreement with SitScape, Inc. Notably, SitScape is the leader in collaborative User-Defined-Operating-Picture (UDOP) solutions, with its well recognized Digital Enterprise Enablement Platform (DEEP) software.The partnership will see rollout of SitScape’s software in AECOM’s Management Services group, which in turn is likely to enhance the latter’s internal operations. AECOM will leverage SitScape’s award-winning, DEEP software, with integrated data analytics, machine learning, process automation and collaboration capabilities to optimize the mission-critical operations of its customers worldwide.Our TakeAECOM is witnessing robust prospects in all of its segments. Evidently, the Construction Services and the Management Services segments continue to benefit from higher margin work in the building construction and power businesses. Also, the company’s solid backlog levels, which are a key indicator of future revenue growth, reflect significant opportunities in the forthcoming quarters. Moreover, the company’s solid level of backlog of large commercial, stadia and power projects is expected to drive revenue growth and margins going ahead.Additionally, AECOM’s diversified portfolio comprises both designing and construction services. The company is also efficient in dealing with cyclical market volatility, which helps it capitalize on upside of its business during downturns. Notably, more than 70% of the company’s profits are generated from the infrastructure and defense markets that are likely to benefit from the favorable political climate in the United States and abroad. In the past six months, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company has returned 0.6% against the industry’s decline of 8%. Also, the Trump administration's focus on investing in defense and cyber security is expected to prove conducive to the company’s growth.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other top-ranked stocks from the same space include Fluor Corporation (FLR  -  Free Report), Willdan Group, Inc.

64,JEC,"We believe adding Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. (JEC  -  Free Report) stock to your portfolio will be a promising investment move at the moment.Over the last six months, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has rallied 1.8%, in contrast with the 8.9% loss incurred by the industry. Why Should You Grab the Stock?Top-Line Prospects: Elevated construction spending in the United States, impressive labor market scenario, modest inflation and Trump’s impetus to boost infrastructure spending have been triggering demand for Jacob’s state-of-the-art construction and engineering services for the past few quarters.Jacobs believes increased global transportation, water infrastructure and resilience investments will bolster revenues of the Buildings & Infrastructure segment. Superior customer relationships and sturdier demand for advanced technology solutions will likely drive the company’s Aerospace & Technology segment’s revenue performance in the quarters ahead.Solid life science, semiconductor, mining & minerals businesses are expected to stoke top-line growth of the company’s Industrial segment. Moreover, amid a lackluster energy market, the company expects that efforts made to strengthen its downstream chemicals and refining business will improve revenues of the Petroleum & Chemicals segment.Per our in-house projections, Jacobs’ revenues will be up 42.3% in fiscal 2018 (ending September 2018) and 12.5% in fiscal 2019 (ending September 2019).Contract Based Growth: Jacobs has a solid contract-winning history. In the last few months, the company has secured several contracts from renowned institutions and public-sector agencies like the Sasol Group Technology, Chevron Corp. (CVX  -  Free Report), the U.S. Army, Equate Petrochemical Company, Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM  -  Free Report), Sellafield Ltd, Saudi Aramco, Kraton Corp. (KRA  -  Free Report) and Codelco. Such deals are anticipated to strengthen the company’s revenues and profit-making prospects in the quarters ahead.Buyout and Restructuring Initiatives: Jacobs has been reinforcing its business on the back of diligent business acquisitions. In sync with this, the company successfully acquired CH2M (December 2017) for $2.85 billion. Jacobs expects to accrue cost synergies worth nearly $150 million in fiscal 2018, on the back of this buyout. Notably, the acquisition is also anticipated to drive the company’s earnings by 30-35 cents per share in fiscal 2018.In December 2017, Jacobs announced that from the second half of fiscal 2018 (ended March 2018), it will report results in three global lines of businesses — Aerospace, Technology, Environmental and Nuclear, Energy, Chemicals and Resources, and Buildings, Infrastructure and Advanced Facilities.The company planned this restructuring in a bid to integrate CH2M HILL Companies Ltd. (‘CH2M’) within its business and expects that the move will boost its operational efficacy.Profitability: Jacobs believes increased focus over high-value businesses, efficient project execution and wider margins will drive its bottom-line performance in the near term.Moreover, the company stated that reduced corporate tax rates (due to implementation of Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017) will help bolster its earnings in the upcoming fiscals. Notably, Jacobs predicts that the U.S. tax reform will boost its earnings by nearly 30 cents per share in fiscal 2018.Jacobs raised its adjusted earnings guidance for fiscal 2018 to the $3.85-$4.25 per share range, higher than the previously estimated range of $3.55-$3.95 per share.Per our in-house projections, the company’s earnings per share will be up 23.8% in fiscal 2018 and 19.1% in fiscal 2019.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization.

66,JEC,"KBR Inc. (KBR  -  Free Report) recently secured a pre-FEED contract from INPEX Corporation’s subsidiary, INPEX Masela Ltd.

In a year’s time, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company’s shares have gained 10.3% against the industry’s decline of 8%.Moreover, an increasing portfolio of smaller and OpEx-facing projects, services, program management, and maintenance contracts offer the company a stronger foundation compared with previous years.

Notably, KBR remains optimistic about backlog growth in 2018 owing to the pipeline of opportunities.The company’s aims to bolster its growth and expand market share through acquisition of companies or assets is encouraging. In this context, some of the recent acquisitions made by KBR include the SGT and the Aspire acquisitions. According to the company, the prospects of both these buyouts are impressive, mainly on account of increased government spending across space and defense.This apart, in 2016, KBR completed the buyout of Honeywell Technology Solutions.

73,JEC,"Job additions continued to be substantial in June, indicating that hiring remains robust even as the economy nears full employment. However, the unemployment rate inched up. But this was due to an increase in the labor force participation rate with several individuals looking to rejoin the workforce. The only worrying sign was the sluggish pace of wage growth, which came in below expectations.June’s jobs report indicates that corporations are successfully filling up open positions even as the pool of skilled workers continues to shrink. Professional and business services led job gains, followed by manufacturing, healthcare and construction. With job gains likely to continue in the coming months, picking stocks from these sectors looks like a prudent option at this point.Rise in Labor Force Participation Boost UnemploymentThough job additions remained robust in June, the unemployment rate increased from an 18-year low of 3.8% to 4%. However, the increase in the unemployment rate was largely attributable to a rise in the labor force participation rate.This metric increased by 0.2 percentage points to 62.9% even as 601,000 individuals chose to rejoin the labor force. The increase in labor force participation is particularly notable, since it comes after three consecutive monthly declines.Meanwhile, average hourly earnings increased by 0.2%, or 5 cents to $26.98 an hour. Consequently, the yearly increase in wages remained unchanged at 2.7% in June. One factor impeding the growth in wages was a fall in full-time positions by 89,000.Professional Services, Manufacturing, Healthcare Lead GainsThe economy added 213,000 jobs in June, exceeding the consensus estimate of 196,000.Economists had predicted that gains would decline to around half this number as the economy nears full employment. Notably, monthly job additions have averaged 200,000 over the past one year. Job additions for April and May were revised upward by a combined 37,000.At the forefront of job gains were manufacturing, healthcare and construction, which added 36,000, 25,000 and 13,000 jobs, respectively. However, leading the pack was professional and business services with 50,000 new jobs. The sector has added 521,000 jobs in the past 12 months.Our ChoicesJob additions in June remained robust despite economists claiming that they would slow as the economy nears full employment. Though the unemployment rate increased, this was largely attributable to an increase in the labor participation rate. As individuals choose to rejoin the workforce, corporations will find it easier to fill up positions even as the skilled labor pool continues to shrink.Professional and business services, manufacturing, healthcare and construction have been the highest recruiters according to the June jobs report. Adding stocks from these sectors looks like a smart choice at this point. However, picking winning stocks may be difficult.This is where our VGM Score comes in. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores.

74,JEC,"KBR, Inc. (KBR  -  Free Report) recently announced that it has secured a license and engineering (LBED) contract from ENAP Refinerías SA to offer its ROSE solvent deasphalting technology at the latter’s Bío Bío refinery located in Concepcion, Chile.Per the deal, KBR will be responsible for providing technology licensing and basic engineering design for ENAP's forthcoming refinery upgrading project, based at Concepcion. KBR's leading ROSE solvent deasphalting technology at ENAP’s 30,000 BPSD plant should enable the refinery to upgrade a greater proportion of its oil intake into high-grade products. Without changing the refinery’s total processing capacity, the new unit is expected to enable a different product mix. Also, the ROSE unit is likely to provide the refinery with more flexibility, in a bid to reduce its products’ environmental footprint and quickly respond to market developments.Our TakeKBR expects growth across all its key markets driven by continued opportunities across the lifecycle of projects. Moreover, the company foresees decent opportunities in ammonia, petrochemical and refining. Notably, selective opportunities in downstream petrochemical and ethylene projects and a growing number of small-scale LNG projects in North America are expected to boost growth of hydrocarbons. Also, LNG activity is rising on the back of increased demand from China and India for environmental reasons. The company believes that healthy balance between hydrocarbons and government projects positions it well for future growth.Furthermore, KBR’s penchant for acquisitions and strategic alliances is allowing it to bolster the company’s inorganic growth and expand market share. Some notable acquisitions made by the company include Honeywell Technology Solutions and Wyle. Also, it remains optimistic about backlog growth in the early 2018 due to the pipeline of opportunities. In the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s shares have returned 16.5% against the industry’s decline of 3.1%.Despite these tailwinds, volatility in the oil and gas markets with oversupply are likely to strain the prices and spending levels, which in turn might affect the company’s projects and orders. Also, prolonged softness in the Engineering & Construction sector along with volatility in material & equipment pricing poses threat to the company's growth.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks from the same space include Fluor Corporation (FLR  -  Free Report), Willdan Group, Inc.

79,JEC,"The length of the current U.S. economic expansion cycle is nearing a record, which makes it tricky for investors to choose stocks for their portfolio. Ideally, we need companies that will perform well even when the economic cycle takes a turn for the worse. For instance, companies that are less dependent on discretionary spending will fare better when the economy treads downward.Also, companies with lower debt burdens will be more resistant to recessionary shocks. Recently, a fair bit of volatility has been witnessed in the market. This, coupled with hawkishness on the part of the Federal Reserve, indicate that the best course of action for investors right now is to play safe. For a portfolio, market anxiety can easily be balanced by investing in a less volatile industry.So which industry can guarantee stability during a recession?Screening Industries for SafetyLet’s get the obvious out of the way. In a recession, retailers rarely have the benefit of a floor on sales. Industries that deal in consumer staples witness lower margins as customers cut corners and shift habits.Focusing on infrastructure companies, their growth is likely to be hampered as new projects are delayed in a recessionary environment. However, infrastructure must be maintained, which grants such companies a steady, stable revenue base. Infrastructure companies have long-term master agreements with utilities to maintain and service pipelines, electrical grids or telecom equipment.The replacement of outdated and risky infrastructure is as essential. Doubtless these companies benefit from economic expansion. But this revenue base makes them a good choice in bad times too.Likewise, renewable energy calls for the improvement of existing electrical grids and construction of new power sources. Transmission and distribution spending are reaching new highs and are set to sustain the trend in the upcoming days. Innovative technologies like fracking require new infrastructure in under-developed regions, which gives another boost to infrastructure companies.Stocks that FitThere is one American company that stands out as a leading provider of infrastructure solutions — Quanta Services Inc. (PWR  -  Free Report). Other companies in the same space include Fluor Corp. (FLR  -  Free Report), Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. (JEC  -  Free Report), KBR, Inc. (KBR  -  Free Report), and AECOM (ACM  -  Free Report). While all these companies provide exposure to the industry we discussed, it will be prudent to assess these companies comparatively as well.Assessing Stocks Under Different MetricsIn terms of earnings history, Quanta Services beat estimates just twice in the trailing four quarters, while Jacobs Engineering managed to generate four healthy beats with an average of 11.4%. Fluor has generated three strong beats in the trailing four quarters with an average of 8.4%.Quanta Services’ forward PE multiple stands at 13.4 right now, lower than the industry’s PE of 17.8. Jacobs Engineering is undervalued as well, with its PE of 15.  Fluor is priced almost at par with the industry, as its PE multiple currently stands at 17.7.In the past year, Quanta Services’ shares have lost 6.4%, which indicates that the company is trading at a discount right now relative to its growth prospects. In contrast, Jacobs Engineering’s shares have returned 8.1%, while Fluor’s shares have rallied 8.3%.However, what we are concerned about safety in turbulent times. Let’s take a look at the companies’ debt-equity ratios. Quanta Services’ debt-to-equity ratio currently stands at just 0.18, much lower than the industry ratio of 0.42. Jacobs Engineering compares unfavorably with the industry with a ratio of 0.43.  Fluor is also riskier than the industry in terms of debt burden, with a ratio of 0.46.Quanta Services’ inherent stability is underlined by its low beta of 0.86, which compares favorably to that of Jacobs Engineering at 1.54 and Fluor’s beta co-efficient of 1.52.Also, in terms of growth, Quanta Services is expected to grow 34.6% this year, higher than the industry’s growth expectation of 23.6%.Estimate RevisionsLet’s see how the analyst community currently feels about these stocks.Quanta Services, which carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), has been attracting bullish analyst attention in recent times. The company’s Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings has trended up from $2.47 to $2.65, in the past two months, which indicates that analysts expect good things from the company this year.Jacobs Engineering, which holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), has also witnessed positive estimates revisions. Its Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 earnings rose from $3.60 to $4.00 in the past 60 days, highlighting bullish analyst sentiment.Fluor sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and has been enjoying favorable estimates revision activity. Its Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings has jumped from $2.38 to $3.26 in the past two months.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Clearly, analysts are feeling optimistic about the space as a whole. The Engineering-R&D Services industry currently holds a Zacks Industry Rank of 72 out of more than 250 industries, and lies among the Top 27% of all industries. Positive industry developments will benefit the stocks as well.While all the stocks hold strong growth potential and enjoy favorable industry trends, in terms of valuation and financial stability, Quanta Services trumps Jacobs Engineering and Fluor. However, in terms of earnings history and Zacks Rank, Jacobs Engineering and Fluor beat Quanta Services.Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio?Earlier this month, credit bureau Equifax announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of every 3 Americans.

These include two separate FEED contracts for a new production, drilling, quarters platform — the Azeri Central East platform to be located in Azerbaijan and a multiple-year master engineering services contract from Covestro.Additionally, the company’s Technology & Consulting segment secured a contract from Indorama Eleme Fertilizer & Chemicals Limited and Toyo Engineering Corporation for the Train 2 ammonia plant, located in Nigeria.Liquidity & Cash FlowAs of Dec 31, 2017, KBR’s cash and equivalents were $439 million, down from $536 million as of Dec 31, 2016.In the quarter under review, cash flow generated from operating activities came in at $193 million, up from $61 million in the year-ago quarter.GuidanceConcurrent with the earnings release, KBR provided its guidance for full-year 2018. The company projects earnings per share within $1.35-$1.45, excluding legal costs associated with the legacy U.S. government contracts.Also, the company expects to incur legal costs of around $10 million or 7 cents per share in the current year. This estimated legacy legal fees exclude any future cost reimbursement from the U.S. Government.Existing Business ScenarioKBR’s Government Services business has been acting as the major profit churner, primarily driven by lucrative contracts from the U.S. military and the new work wins from the UK Ministry of Defense.Moreover, for the Technology & Consulting segment, KBR expects thriving global technology opportunities led by ammonia, refining and olefins projects to persist, thus remaining bullish about its prospects. Further, KBR expects growth across all its key markets in the United States, the UK and Australia, driven by continued opportunities across the lifecycle of projects.However, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s lower revenues from the Engineering and Construction segments have been a pressing concern for the past few quarters.

(PWR  -  Free Report) recently announced that it has successfully acquired Northwest Lineman College (NLC), a dominant educational and training organization, in January 2018. Based in Boise, Idaho, Northwest Lineman College serves the electric power industry. Hence, this latest deal will allow Quanta Services to offer training services across the entire lifespan of a line worker's career. However, the terms of the acquisition were kept under wraps.Acquisition RationaleQuanta Services expects its end markets to continue to experience historic levels of capital and operating investments, thus increasing the demand for skilled labor. This acquisition will enable the company to meet the training and recruiting demands for its workforce. In addition, NLC’s ongoing development of natural gas distribution and communications curriculum will benefit Quanta Services as well as its customers. Furthermore, the application of NLC's educational models in all of the company’s service lines is expected to facilitate the development of extra curricula over time.Expansion PlansQuanta Services intends to pursue growth and develop incremental backlog through acquisition of companies or assets to improve its service offerings.

Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Chicago Bridge & Iron Company N.V. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Chicago Bridge & Iron Company N.V. QuoteIn the full year, revenues were down 22.1% year over year to $6.7 billion.

90,JEC,"Dycom Industries Inc. (DY  -  Free Report) has recently lowered its outlook for second-quarter fiscal 2018 (ended Jan 27) ahead of the release of results (scheduled on Feb 28). Shares were down about 15% at one point in pre-market trading following the news, reflecting investors’ disappointment with the lowered guidance.For the fiscal second quarter, the company expects to report adjusted earnings in the band of 9-12 cents per share, assuming revenues of about $655 million. This is comparable with prior projections of adjusted earnings per share in the range of 24-36 cents, on revenues within the $645-$675 million band.On a GAAP basis, it projects diluted earnings per share in the band of $1.20-$1.23, incorporating tax benefits from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.The company lowered its guidance on account of reduction in number of available workdays due to adverse weather conditions, which had an adverse impact on productivity and margins during the quarter-end. Also, the company adjusted its fiscal-year end from the last Saturday in July to the last Saturday in January, resulting in the commencement of fiscal 2019 on Jan 28, 2018.Furthermore, Dycom provided guidance for fiscal 2019 and updated its outlook for first-quarter fiscal 2019. For the fiscal year, the company anticipates revenues to be in the range of $3.30 to $3.50 billion, with diluted earnings per share within $5.22-$6.14. For first-quarter fiscal 2019, the company expects adjusted earnings per share in the band 63-78 cents, assuming revenues to lie between $720 million and $750 million.Our TakeDycom has had an impressive run over the past few quarters, with an earnings beat streak that has lasted for seven consecutive quarters.Going forward, we believe that favorable industry trends like surging demand for 1 Gigabyte deployments, huge investment in wireline networks and cable capacity projects are likely to bode well for the company. Meanwhile, the industry is witnessing a dramatically increasing network bandwidth with major industry participants deploying significant 1 gigabit wireline networks. In the past few quarters, the company has gained profitable market share, extended geographic reach as well as expanded program management network planning services, which have added to its growth.Moreover, the company anticipates engineering and construction activity to increase throughout this year. In fact, several large programs have already gained momentum and many new contracts commenced meaningful activity, thus propelling Dycom’s growth. Also, emerging wireless technologies are fuelling wireline investments growth and the company remains optimistic that a complimentary wireline investment cycle is round the corner. In the past three months, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has returned 27.2%, outperforming the industry’s gain of 6.6%.Dycom also has a strong portfolio of customers like the telecom and wireless equipment biggies such as AT&T, Comcast, CenturyLink and Verizon, to name a few. In the first quarter fiscal 2018, about 74.9% of the company’s total revenues were derived from its top five customers. Moving ahead, we expect the company to further benefit from its collaboration with such renowned telecom operators. Moreover, the company’s strong financial position coupled with diligent operational execution allows it to undertake strategic initiatives for expanding market share.However, the U.S. telecommunications industry is facing intense pricing competition. Severe spectrum crunch, coupled with gradual Smartphone and tablet adoption, are compelling wireless operators to seek other options for raising revenues.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the same space are Potlatch Corporation (PCH  -  Free Report), D.R.

93,JEC,"Fluor Corporation (FLR  -  Free Report) recently declared that the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (“MBTA”) selected Fluor-led joint venture (JV) as the design-build team for the projected $2 billion Green Line Light Rail Extension in Boston. Share of the contract value will be booked into backlog of the company in the fourth quarter of this year.Fluor will lead the JV team consisting of Balfour Beatty Infrastructure, Herzog Contracting Group and The Middlesex Corp. The project is scheduled to begin construction next year and open for service in late 2021.Working in collaboration with MBTA, the project includes seven new stations including a vehicle storage and maintenance facility, the relocated Lechmere Station and two distinct branches. It also includes a mainline branch in Cambridge as well as a branch line in Somerville.The project is anticipated to solve longstanding transportation problems by improving local as well as regional mobility by providing a one-seat ride to downtown Boston. This in turn will reduce greenhouse gas emissions as well as congestion. The estimated daily ridership at these seven stations is projected to be 45,000 by 2030.Our TakeFluor’s strategy of maintaining a good business portfolio mix permits it to focus on the more stable business markets and capitalize on developing the cyclical markets at suitable times. The long-term prospects of the company remain strong with existing growth opportunities in renewable energy, gas-fired combined cycle generation and air emissions compliance projects for existing coal-fired power plants.The company maintains a strong focus on enhancing competitive position in the market through prudent leadership initiatives and strategic alliances. In this regard, it has undertaken a restructuring initiative under its construction and fabrication operations to improve control and delivery of projects, consequently enhancing client satisfaction. Such strategic collaborations are expected to be accretive to the company’s financials and contribute to long-term growth.This apart, the company keeps an impressive track record of receiving awards, and management remains optimistic about continuation of this trend in future as well, which is expected to drive growth for the company. Further, the company has strong long-term prospects in fields like in renewable energy, gas-fired combined cycle generation and air emissions compliance projects. The company has returned 24.4% in the past three months, outperforming the industry’s gain of 16.1%.However, the fact remains that, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has been witnessing continuous backlog erosion over the past few quarters. The backlog erosion can be attributable to exclusion of large reimbursable nuclear projects. Moreover, the company’s margins are under pressure as it is transitioning from higher margin engineering to lower margin construction activities, particularly related to Energy & Chemicals and Mining segment.This apart, volatility in commodity prices, and the cyclical nature of the company’s commodity-based business lines, poses significant challenges in the near term. Moreover, going forward, the company believes that clients of Energy, Chemicals and Mining segment will maintain a cautious approach while taking investment decisions which is likely to add to the woes.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the same space include EMCOR Group, Inc. (EME  -  Free Report), Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. (JEC  -  Free Report) and Willdan Group, Inc. (WLDN  -  Free Report).

Also, the bottom line increased 7.5% from the year-ago tally of 53 cents.

Moreover, revenues came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4,585 million.Further, the company achieved 8% organic growth in the fiscal first quarter that reached to a new all-time high. The continued strong performance of Building Construction and Power business proved favorable for the top line.AECOM Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise AECOM Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | AECOM QuoteSegment wise, Design & Consulting Services (DCS) revenues rose 5.5% year over year to $1,941.9 million. Also, on a constant currency basis, organic revenues increased 5% on the back of strong performance in the company’s transportation and water markets in the Americas. The transportation and water markets were driven by improved funding as well as continued growth across international markets.Construction Services (CS) revenues increased 21.4% to $2,125.5 million on a year-over-year basis. On a constant currency basis, organic revenues were up 11%. Stellar performance of this segment was driven by Building Construction and Power businesses.On the other hand, Management Services (MS) revenues registered an impressive year-over-year growth of 9.9% to $843.4 million. It also grew 10% on an organic basis, reflecting strong business momentum.However, AECOM’s adjusted operating income in the fiscal first quarter was $158.1 million, down from the year-ago tally of $188.2 million. New order wins in the quarter totaled $6.1 billion. Also, AECOM’s total book-to-burn ratio during the quarter was 1.2%, with significant contribution from the DCS, CS and MS segments.  At the end of the fiscal first quarter, AECOM’s total backlog was at an all-time high of $48.8 billion, up 11%, reflecting a favorable mix shift to the higher-margin DCS and MS segments.

The company continues to expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.50-$2.90.In terms of spending, the company continues to project to incur interest expense (excluding amortization of deferred financing fees) of $210 million and capital expenditures of $110 million.Our TakeAECOM’s first-quarter 2018 results have been quite impressive, with substantial growth in both top and bottom-line performance. Record backlog and accelerating revenue growth proved conductive to the company’s growth.Moreover, the company’s diversified portfolio comprises both designing and construction services. The company is also efficient in dealing with cyclical market volatility that helps it capitalize on the upside of its business during downturns. More than 70% of AECOM’s profits are generated from infrastructure and defense markets that are poised to benefit from the favorable political climate, both in the United States and abroad.However, cyclical demand of the company’s services and currency fluctuations are likely to thwart growth, going forward. This apart, the company believes that economic conditions in many of its end-markets, including Canada, China and the Middle East, have weakened over time and may remain difficult in the near future.AECOM carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderA few better-ranked stocks in the same space include Boise Cascade, L.L.C.

96,JEC,"Fluor Corporation (FLR  -  Free Report) recently announced the completion of a high priority 38kv power line close to San Juan. The company was working under a contract with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (“USACE”). The high priority power line will enable Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority to re-energize lines, serving an area of Carolina that consists of a hospital as well as residential neighborhoods.The contract called for power grid restoration and repair & replacement of structures and equipment supporting the re-energization. It also involved recommissioning of electrical infrastructure in eastern Puerto Rico.Existing Business ScenarioFluor has a solid track record of receiving awards. Management remains optimistic about continuation of this trend in the future as well, which is expected to drive growth. The company has strong long-term prospects in fields like in renewable energy, gas-fired combined cycle generation and air emissions compliance projects.Based on the present trends, Fluor remains confident that it will secure two major EPC mining projects in the next few quarters. The company’s healthy level of backlog in infrastructure, government, life sciences and advanced manufacturing has allowed it to offset multiyear declines in mining, metals, and oil & gas markets.Fluor has returned 25.4% in the past three months, outperforming the industry’s gain of 16.6%.Despite such impressive growth drivers, volatility in commodity prices, and the cyclical nature of the company’s commodity-based business lines, poses significant challenges in the coming quarters.

99,JEC,"Premium technical services company Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. (JEC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 (ended Dec 31, 2017) results before the market opens on Feb 7.Notably, Jacobs delivered a positive average earnings surprise of 9.65%, in the last four quarters. Notably, the company’s earnings in fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 came in at 98 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 82 cents.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at Play Elevated infrastructure spending in the United States and recovering economic conditions in China (a major industrial end-market) are anticipated to boost demand for Jacobs’ premium engineering and construction management services. The $4.6-billion contract win from the Missile Defense Agency (August 2017), contract wins for the U.S. government’s national priority programs and the Blue Canopy acquisition (August 2017) are anticipated to bolster revenues of Jacobs’ Aerospace & Technology line of business (LOB). On the other hand, new investments made in targeted sectors (like social infrastructure, water and transportation), elevated demand from the Asia Pacific, Americas and European end-markets, and the latest transportation contract wins are expected to strengthen the top-line performance of Jacobs’ Buildings & Infrastructure LOB. Revenues of Industrial LOB will likely improve on the back of the recovering mining & minerals business, robust life-science business and sturdy field services sales in the United States.Strong top-line performance of the aforementioned segments, greater cost management, ongoing restructuring moves and timely project delivery are expected to reinforce the company’s bottom-line performance.However, Jacobs believes its revenues in the to-be-reported quarter might dip sequentially (excluding the impact of the CH2M buyout in December 2017). The company expects that the challenging energy market conditions might continue to hurt the near-term revenues of its Petroleum & Chemicals LOB.We also fear that other headwinds such as intense industry rivalry or adverse foreign currency-translation impact might weigh over Jacobs’ top- and bottom-line performances in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Jacobs is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as we will see below.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: Jacobs currently has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.

100,JEC,"Premium technical services company Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. (JEC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 (ended Sep 30, 2017) results before the market opens on Nov 21.The company’s earnings in third-quarter fiscal 2017 came in at 79 cents, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, the company delivered a positive average earnings surprise of 4.77%, over the preceding four quarters.Over the last month, Jacobs’ shares yielded a return of 0.5%, as against the 1.8% loss incurred by the industry. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayElevated infrastructure spending in the United States and recovering economic conditions in China (a major industrial end-market) are anticipated to boost demand for Jacobs’ premium engineering and construction management services, going forward. The company also believes its strategic restructuring moves will continue to reduce it operational costs in the near term.In addition to the above, Jacobs has been steadily enhancing its business and brand status on the back of prestigious contract wins. In the last few months, the company has secured several contracts from renowned institutions and public-sector agencies like the Shell Oil Company, Chevron Products Company, the U.S. Army, EQUATE Petrochemical Company, TransCanada Corporation and Sellafield Ltd. Notably, higher transportation spending of the government authorities of Australia, the U.K. and the United States has largely increased Jacobs’ contract winning opportunities.However, turbulence in the oil and gas market is expected to hurt the company’s Petroleum & Chemicals segment’s performance in the quarter to be reported and even after. Moreover, disappointing field services revenues might adversely affect the company’s Industrial segment’s business. Jacobs also believes reduced public spending in the U.K. will thwart its revenues and profitability in the fiscal fourth quarter.We also fear that other headwinds such as intense industry rivalry or adverse foreign currency translation impact might weigh over Jacobs’ top- and bottom-line performances in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.Based on the current market conditions, the company projects earnings in the range of $3.00-$3.15 per share for fiscal 2017.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Jacobs is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

Furthermore, this buyout will likely make the company a $15-billion global solutions provider in the market, going forward.Jacobs is highly committed toward its shareholders and intends to provide them higher returns through lucrative share repurchase and dividend programs. In January 2017, the company announced the initiation of its cash dividend program. This reflects the company’s robust long-term financial outlook, expectations for a robust operating performance and anticipation of solid free cash flow generation. In addition to its cash dividend program, Jacobs will continue with its ongoing share repurchase program. In July 2015, the company had announced a second phase $500-million share buyback program to be implemented over the next three fiscal years.However, in third-quarter fiscal 2017, Jacobs’ revenues dipped 6.6% year over year. On a segmental basis, the top-line results of Petroleum & Chemicals, Aerospace & Technology and Industrial segments dropped 21.7%, 12.3% and 3.5%, respectively. Dismal pricing conditions in the oil and gas market have been marring Jacobs’ Petroleum & Chemicals segment’s businesses.Moreover, conclusion of several field services projects is responsible for weighing over the company’s Industrial businesses. Persistence of these issues, as well as reduced government spending in major end-markets might also weaken the company’s top-line performance in the quarters ahead.Also, we believe that low-entry barriers in the engineering, architectural, consulting and designing market segments have escalated threats of market rivalry for Jacobs. Poor competency or business inefficiencies over the long run might shrink the market share and profitability of the company from such business fragments.Moreover, the maintenance and construction sites of the company are subject to certain risks related to safety issues. Any untoward incident at these sites might generate severe financial losses for Jacobs.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!                   It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

Robust cash flow, record backlog, and accelerating revenue growth proved conductive to the company’s growth.However, this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company’s business is affected by the uncertain global political and economical conditions. For instance, the economic slowdown in China poses a major threat.Moreover, AECOM is facing certain challenges in certain end markets that might weigh on its near-term financial performance. The company believes that economic conditions in many of its end markets, including Canada, China and the Middle East, have weakened over time and may remain difficult in the near future, which might dent revenues.Stocks to Consider Some better-ranked stocks in the same space include Norbord Inc.

103,JEC,"In corporate finance, leverage is a well-known business strategy adopted by companies  to borrow funds to finance working capital requirements, acquisitions or for some kind of business expansion. Now, the two most common financial resources corporates resort to are debt and equity. Interestingly, a comparative analysis of the cost of capital theory reveals that most companies prefer debt financing over equity, as debt is available at a lower cost compared to equity; especially in periods of low interest rates. This happens because when a company finances its operations with debt, it takes on fixed expenses in the form of interest payments for a fixed time period.Whereas, in case of equity financing, a shareholder not only becomes a partial owner of the company but develops a direct claim on the company’s future profits as well. Another perk of debt financing is that the interest on debt is tax deductible.Yet, debt financing has its drawbacks. The problem arises when the amount of debt a company bears becomes exorbitant. Especially, at times of high interest rates, companies with large debt loads become more prone to bankruptcy.That said, for the investor, the real challenge is determining whether the stock in which he/she is investing has a sustainable debt level, since a debt-free corporation is rare to find. Therefore, the debt level of a company is an important point of consideration while making  an investment decision. Several leverage ratios have emerged as efficient tools to evaluate a company’s credit level to support prudent equity investments. The most popular among them is the debt-to-equity ratio.Analyzing Debt/EquityDebt-to-Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities/Shareholders’ EquityThis metric is a liquidity ratio that indicates the amount of financial risk a company bears. A company with a lower debt-to-equity ratio implies that it has a more or less financially stable business, thereby making it a better investment pick.With the Q4 reporting cycle in full swing by now, companies reflecting high earnings growth should be ideal investment choices. However, such growth stocks may also be highly leveraged ones.Since a greater cohort of investors is risk-averse by nature, it is reasonable to expect that they will be more attracted to companies with low leverage than high earnings growth.The Winning StrategyConsidering the aforementioned factors, it is wise to choose stocks with a low debt-to-equity ratio to ensure safe returns.However, an investment strategy based solely on the debt-to-equity ratio might not fetch the desired outcome. To choose stocks that have the potential to give you steady returns, we have expanded our screening criteria to include some other factors.Here are the other parameters:Debt/Equity less than X-Industry Median: Stocks that are less leveraged than their industry peers.Current Price greater than or equal to 10: The stocks must be trading at a minimum of $10 or above.Average 20-day Volume greater than or equal to 50000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Percentage Change in EPS F(0)/F(-1) greater than X-Industry Median: Earnings growth adds to optimism, leading to a stock’s price appreciation.Estimated One-Year EPS Growth F(1)/F(0) greater than 5: This shows earnings growth expectation.Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy): Irrespective of market conditions, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 have a proven history of success.VGM Score of A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Excluding stocks that have a negative or a zero debt-to-equity ratio, here are five of the 21 stocks that made it through the screen.Anthem, Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report): The company is one of the largest publicly traded managed care organizations in terms of membership. It pulled off an average positive earnings surprise of 11.48% in the trailing four quarters and carries a Zacks Rank #2.Jacobs Engineering Group Inc.

104,JEC,"KBR, Inc.(KBR  -  Free Report) recently won a new contract from Toyo Engineering Corporation (Toyo) and Indorama Eleme Fertilizer & Chemicals Limited (Indorama), for an undisclosed amount.Per the deal, the company will provide its premium patented catalyst and equipment, technology licensing and basic engineering design services for the new ammonia plant of Indorama, located at the Port Harcourt site of Nigeria.The aggregate revenues related with the project were booked into KBR’s Technology & Consulting Business segment’s backlog of unfilled orders in fourth-quarter 2017 (results not yet released).KBR is recognized as a renowned ammonia technology leader, and has offered designing, licensing, engineering and construction services in more than 100 restoration ammonia projects, and 230 basic ammonia plants. We believe the company will make use of its long-standing experience and expertise to efficiently accomplish services for the Indorama project.Our Take The U.S. construction market is currently strengthening on the back of President Trump’s impetus to boost infrastructure spending and business-friendly regulatory environment in the country. However, advanced growth opportunities have enhanced business rivalry among the major construction service providing behemoths. In order to arrest a wider market share and win over peers like Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. (JEC  -  Free Report), AECOM (ACM  -  Free Report) and Altair Engineering Inc. (ALTR  -  Free Report); KBR is currently boosting its competency with robust growth drivers.The company’s diverse business portfolio enables it to combat cyclicality associated with any single market. Its Government Services business has been witnessing stellar growth and the company believes recent acquisitions will accelerate growth momentum of this business in the near term also. Moreover, KBR’s Consulting business is also experiencing increased activity, indicating potential opportunities in future engineering and construction projects. Also, the company’s high backlog level indicates its underlying strength.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

(JEC  -  Free Report) recently secured a new contract from the energy business arm of Carcross/Tagish First Nation (C/TFN) — Carcross/Tagish Energy Corporation (C/TEC) — for an undisclosed amount.C/TEC creates eco-energy business prospects and sustainable employments for the citizens and communities of the First Nations of Canada.As per this three-year deal, the company will provide its premium technical consultation and engineering services for the various projects and business initiatives undertaken by C/TEC in Northern British Columbia and the Traditional Territories of Southern Yukon, such as the Montana Mountain’s wind power generation project.The company believes the aforementioned engineering service contract will fortify its energy business. Notably, deal from this new energy client will strengthen its footprint in the First Nations of Canada.Jacobs has previously offered various state-of-the-art sustainable solutions for its Canadian renewables and power generation clients.

(December 2017) will fortify Jacobs’ business in the near term.Jacobs quotes competitive prices for its contracts and ensures that the number of contract receipts increases over time.

106,JEC,"Fluor Corporation (FLR  -  Free Report) recently announced that it has clinched a contract from Shell for the engineering, procurement and fabrication of Shell’s Penguins floating production storage as well as offloading (FPSO) vessel in the North Sea. The company will book the contract value in fourth-quarter 2017.Per the deal, Fluor has been assigned the task to design, fabricate as well as deliver the pre-commissioned FPSO to the North Sea. The FPSO will be designed to carry a production capacity of 45,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with a storage capacity of 400,000 barrels. The FPSO is anticipated to operate 20 years uninterruptedly, without dry docking and would facilitate the extension of the life of the Penguins oil and gas fields. The project follows the company’s successful delivery of the Malampaya Phase 3 Project in Philippines and would be led by its Manila, Philippines office.Existing Business ScenarioFluor has an impressive track record of receiving awards, and management remains optimistic about continuation of this trend in future as well.  Going forward, Fluor anticipates an increase in front-end engineering awards, which should help boost growth. Moreover, the company remains optimistic about investment projects, particularly on LNG projects in North America, chemical facilities and pipeline projects in the United States, as well as refining and chemical projects in the Middle East and Asia.The company is enjoying a healthy level of backlog in infrastructure, government, life sciences and advanced manufacturing, which has offset multi-year declines in mining, metals and oil & gas markets. Additionally, being an industry leader in nuclear remediation at government facilities throughout the United States, the company, is likely to benefit from the rising demand for energy globally.The long-term prospects of the company also remain strong with existing growth opportunities in renewable energy, gas-fired combined cycle generation and air emissions compliance projects for existing coal-fired power plants. Notably, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has returned 36.4% in the past three months, outperforming the industry’s growth of 12.8%.Despite these positives, volatility in commodity prices and the cyclical nature of the company’s commodity-based business lines, poses significant challenges for it in the upcoming quarters.  Going forward, it also believes that clients of Energy, Chemicals and Mining segment will maintain a cautious approach while taking investment decisions, which will add to the woes. This apart, the company is facing a dearth of engineering and new awards currently which has hurt growth prospects significantly.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the same space include D.R.

107,JEC,"KBR, Inc. (KBR  -  Free Report) recently announced that it expects no interruption in the execution of a project being carried out through a joint venture with Carillion due to Carillion's liquidation. Currently, the company operates a stand-alone joint venture (JV) with Carillion on Project Allenby Connaught through its Aspire Defence entities.The JV has been carrying out successful service operations for the Ministry of Defense since 2006, offering high quality design, construction as well as maintenance services to the British Army. Over the past three months, the company has been undergoing contingency planning and is well-positioned to carry out the operations.Our TakeKBR is presently banking on the strength of Government Services businesses to optimize its growth potential. The particular business is growing steadily, adding to the company’s depth.  The company expects growth across all its key markets in the United States, UK and Australia, driven by continued opportunities across the lifecycle of projects. For the Technology & Consulting segment, the company anticipates thriving global technology opportunities led by ammonia, refining and petrochemical projects to persist. Additionally, growing client operational expenditure is set to benefit the Engineering and Construction segment.In the past six months, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has returned 33.7% outperforming the industry’s average growth of 20.1%. KBR’s eye on strategic acquisitions and alliances have bolstered inorganic growth and expanded market share. Over the past few quarters, KBR completed several strategic acquisitions, including two established and highly technical government services companies. This buyout fortifies the company’s position as a professional services and technologies provider.Despite these positives, uncertain global political and economical conditions are likely to affect the company’s performance. Current volatility in the oil and gas markets, along with oversupply which is straining prices and spending levels, will hurt the company’s projects and orders. This apart, reduced capital expenditure by key clients and currency fluctuations are adversely impacting backlogs.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the same space include Thor Industries, Inc.

108,JEC,"Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. (JEC  -  Free Report) recently acquired CH2M HILL Companies, Ltd. (‘CH2M’) for roughly $2.85 billion, paid through stock and cash transaction. The deal is in sync with Jacobs’ profitable growth strategy and will likely make the company a $15-billion global solutions provider.Over the past month, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company yielded a return of 11.5%, outperforming 5.2% growth recorded by the industry.Inside the HeadlinesThe acquisition was originally announced on Aug 2, when Jacobs created an Integration Management Office (‘IMO’) for methodically planning the integration process of the CH2M buyout. The IMO has shaped rigorous protocols and processes to drive growth synergies, and realize cost savings appropriately from the deal.Jacobs believes the CH2M acquisition will strengthen its global water business over the long run. In addition to the above, the company stated that the CH2M buyout will fortify its businesses across the industrial sector. It will also enhance the company’s chemicals, energy and resources portfolio in the near future.Moreover, Jacobs’ explicit experience in government nuclear decommissioning projects, when combined with CH2M’s distinguished expertise in big scale nuclear and environmental remediation programs, will likely give rise to significant business expansion prospects. Also, CH2M’s environmental know-how complements Jacobs’ commercial bond with the U.S. federal government.Jacobs anticipates accruing an annualized savings of roughly $150 million from the CH2M integration by the end of the second year of the deal’s closure. The company also reaffirmed its previously stated earnings per share outlook for fiscal 2018 to the $3.55-$3.95 per share range. By the end of the first year following the deal completion, the company anticipates the acquired assets to boost its adjusted cash earnings per share by 25% and earnings per share by 15%.

109,JEC,"Chicago Bridge & Iron Company N.V.  followed last quarter’s colossal earnings miss with fourth consecutive miss in third-quarter 2017. The company reported adjusted earnings of 34 cents per share, massively lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 53 cents.The bottom line fared even worse in year-over-year comparison, having plunged 91.7% from the year-ago earnings figure of $1.20. Profits were badly hurt due to higher restructuring charges, high cost on IPL and Calpine power projects as well as with execution of its other projects.Inside the HeadlinesThe company reported quarterly revenues of $1,738 million from continuing operations, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,809 million. Further, revenues declined 18.7% year over year. The lackluster top-line performance during the quarter was largely a result of revenue declines across both segments of the company.Meanwhile, the company’s revenues from its discontinued operations (The Technology operations) came at $170.1 million, compared with $183.3 million in the prior-year quarter.Chicago Bridge & Iron Company N.V. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Chicago Bridge & Iron Company N.V. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Chicago Bridge & Iron Company N.V. QuoteThird-quarter gross profit plummeted 59.1% year over year to $82.8 million, while gross margin contracted a substantial 530 basis points to 4.8%. Net income for the quarter came in at $10 million, compared with $121.8 million in the year ago quarter.The company booked new awards worth $437 million during the quarter compared with $1.7 billion in the prior-year quarter. The decline in new awards was due to lower-than-expected new award wins within Engineering & Construction Operating Group (E&C), due to the delay of certain key projects.Segmental RevenueRevenues from the Engineering and Construction segment came in at $1,348 million, down 19.3% on a year-over-year basis. The decline is primarily attributable to changes in estimated margins on two U.S. gas turbine power projects as well as additional costs on U.S. LNG projects. New awards in this segment were $65.2 million in the quarter, reflecting a huge decline compared with its value of $1.5 billion in the year ago quarter.Fabrication Services quarterly revenues totaled $389.7 million, falling 16.6% year over year. New awards received by this segment rose (up 72.7%) to $371.8 million at the end of the third quarter compared with $215.3 million in the prior-year quarter.LiquidityChicago Bridge & Iron’s cash and cash equivalents as of Sep 30, 2017 came in at $341.9 million compared with $615 million a year ago. Net cash used in operating activities in the quarter came in at $688 million, a turnaround from the net cash generated from operating activities of $495 million in the comparable period last year.Major DevelopmentsDuring the quarter, the company decided to sell its Technology business, which it believes would add significant value for stakeholders. The company plans to complete the transaction by the end of this year. It also intends to use the proceeds to reduce total debt and reinvest in its Engineering and Construction, and Fabrication Services businesses.GuidanceChicago Bridge & Iron currently expects to generate revenues in the range of $1.8-$2 billion for fourth-quarter 2017. The company also expects earnings to be in the range of 50-60 cents per share.Existing Business ScenarioOver the past few quarters, decreased activity on large cost reimbursable LNG projects in Asia Pacific region, the winding down of several E&C projects and the timing of progress on projects in Fabrication Services group have dragged revenues for the company. The headwinds may continue to hurt Chicago Bridge & Iron’s operations going forward as well.

110,JEC,"Lennox International, Inc. (LII  -  Free Report) is slated to release third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 23, before the market opens.The company engages in designing, manufacturing and marketing of climate-control solutions. Its technologically advanced products are primarily used in the heating, ventilation, air conditioning and refrigeration end markets. Over the last month, Lennox International’s shares yielded a return of 4.5%, outperforming 2.9% growth recorded by the industry.In fact, the company pulled off an average positive earnings surprise of 7.53% over the trailing four quarters.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors to PlayLennox International believes its ongoing research and development projects and new marketing programs will likely bolster the top-line performance of the company’s Commercial Heating & Cooling and Refrigeration segments in the second half of 2017. Notably, we notice that Zacks Consensus Estimates for the company’s Commercial Heating & Cooling and Refrigeration segments’ revenues are currently pegged at $262 million and $191 million respectively for third-quarter 2017, higher than the corresponding tallies of $259 million and $190 million recorded in the preceding quarter.The company also believes sourcing and engineering-led cost reductions, favorable price and mix, higher volumes as well as advantageous product costs and warranty will enhance the profitability of the aforementioned segments in the upcoming quarters.Lennox International also anticipates that solid revenues generated from the latest construction and replacement businesses will bolster its Residential Heating & Cooling segment’s revenues going ahead.However, the Zacks Consensus Revenue Estimate for the segment is currently pegged at $589 million, lower than $654 million revenues reported in the prior quarter. We fear that headwinds such as unfavorable foreign currency translation impact or unexpected decline in market share might hurt the segment’s top-line results in the near future.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Lennox International will likely beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as we will see below.  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: Lennox International has an Earnings ESP of -1.85%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at $2.40 per share, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher at $2.45.Lennox International, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Lennox International, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Lennox International, Inc.

112,JEC,"Debt financing is a common practice among corporates to ensure smooth operations and business expansion. This is because depending solely on retained earnings for business growth is impracticable.Although companies may raise capital through equity financing, debt financing has always been a favored choice. While debt financing brings with it the liability of interest payment, it provides funding at lower rates than equity financing, especially in periods of historically low interest rates. Another perk of debt financing is that the interest on debt is tax deductible.Yet, debt financing has its drawbacks. Since too much debt increases the cost of capital for the company, bearing huge debt tends to shoot up the company’s risk of bankruptcy, especially in times of economic crisis.With the Federal Reserve having raised their benchmark interest rate last December and two more hikes expected by analysts this year, the debt scenario does not seem very favorable for U.S. stocks.The fact that only a fortunate few can avoid taking debt, should not dissuade investors from betting on stocks. Instead, a prudent investor will try to pick stocks that are less financially leveraged as companies with high debt load are risky options.And here comes the importance of leverage ratios, which have been constructed historically to save investors from debt traps. The debt-to-equity ratio is one such measure, perhaps the most popular one, to evaluate a company’s credit worthiness, for potential equity investments.Analyzing Debt/EquityDebt-to-Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities/Shareholders’ EquityThis metric is a liquidity ratio that indicates the amount of financial risk a company bears. A company with a lower debt-to-equity ratio implies that it has a more or less financially stable business, thereby making it a better investment pick.With the Q4 reporting cycle about to begin, investors will tend to target stocks exhibiting solid earnings growth.But choosing stocks that boast earnings growth only might not be a wise investment strategy. A higher degree of leverage can turn an attractive investment option into a nightmare in times of financial crisis.The Winning StrategyConsidering the aforementioned factors, it is wise to choose stocks with a low debt-to-equity ratio to ensure safe returns.However, an investment strategy based solely on the debt-to-equity ratio might not fetch the desired outcome. To choose stocks that have the potential to give you steady returns, we have expanded our screening criteria to include some other factors.Here are the other parameters:Debt/Equity less than X-Industry Median: Stocks that are less leveraged than their industry peers.Current Price greater than or equal to 10: The stocks must be trading at a minimum of $10 or above.Average 20-day Volume greater than or equal to 50000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Percentage Change in EPS F(0)/F(-1) greater than X-Industry Median: Earnings growth adds to optimism, leading to a stock’s price appreciation.Estimated One-Year EPS Growth F(1)/F(0) greater than 5: This shows earnings growth expectation.Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy): Irrespective of market conditions, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 have a proven history of success.VGM Score of A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Excluding stocks that have a negative or a zero debt-to-equity ratio, here are five of the 21 stocks that made it through the screen.Rice Midstream Partners LP (RMP  -  Free Report): This is a midstream energy company that owns, operates, develops and acquires midstream assets in the Appalachian Basin. It pulled off an average positive earnings surprise of 35.25% in the trailing four quarters and carries a Zacks Rank #1.Jacobs Engineering Group Inc.

126,JEC,"On Nov 23, we issued an updated research report on Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. (JEC  -  Free Report), a premium technical services company,In the last three months, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock yielded a return of 24.7%, outperforming 17.8% growth recorded by the industry.Factors Driving GrowthTrump's initiatives to boost infrastructure spending in the United States and recovering economic conditions of the major industrial-end market in China are anticipated to boost demand for Jacobs' engineering and construction management services.The company reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 (ended Sep 29, 2017) results, primarily on the back of robust performance delivered by the Buildings & Infrastructure segment. It believes that new investments made in sectors like social infrastructure, water and transportation will continue to strengthen the segment's performance. Further, increased transportation spending of the government authorities of certain countries like Australia and New Zealand are likely to drive the segment's revenue growth. In fact, the company believes that improved Aerospace & Technology as well as Industrial line of businesses will aid in bolstering revenues in the quarters ahead.Moreover, the company is steadily enhancing business and brand status on the back of organic growth initiatives. In the last few months, Jacobs secured several contracts from renowned institutions and public-sector agencies like the Sasol Group Technology, the U.S. Army and Equate Petrochemical Company. Such lucrative deals are anticipated to escalate the revenues in the upcoming quarters.Moreover, the company is reinforcing business on the back of meaningful business acquisitions. In sync with this, the company acquired a prominent data analytics and cyber security company, Blue Canopy, in August 2017. This buyout will aid the company in expanding its federal civilian information technology services' business in the quarters ahead. Additionally, the company has inked a deal to acquire CH2M HILL Companies Ltd. for $2.85 billion in the same month. Through this buyout, Jacobs anticipates to add cost synergies worth $150 million going forward. Further, this acquisition is expected to make Jacobs a $15-billion global solutions' provider in the market. The deal is anticipated to be closed by mid-December.However, we observed that Zacks Consensus Estimate for this stock has remained unchanged for fiscal 2018 in the last 60 days, reflecting neutral sentiments.Amid its efforts to shift business focus to the downstream market, Jacobs’ Petroleum & Chemicals segment currently remains challenged by volatile energy market conditions. In the fourth quarter, top-line results of this segment dipped 2.6% year over year. The company anticipates further downside in oil prices which is likely to continue to hurt upstream and midstream businesses, going forward.Moreover, we perceive that low-entry barriers in engineering, architectural, consulting and designing market segments have escalated threats of market rivalry for Jacobs. Poor competency in the long run might diminish the market share and profitability of the company from such business fragments.Moreover, the maintenance and construction sites of Jacobs are subject to certain risks related to safety issues. Any adversities at these sites might generate severe financial losses for the company. Also, business expansion in foreign nations has exposed the company to risks arising from unfavorable foreign currency movements and geopolitical issues.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks within the industry are listed below:Fenner PLC  carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

133,JEC,"Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. (JEC  -  Free Report) is slated to release third-quarter 2017 results before the market opens on Aug 08. In the last reported quarter, the company reported earnings of 78 cents per share, which came above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 71 cents. In the trailing four quarters, Jacobs delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 5.8%, beating estimates thrice while matching once. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayJacobs believes that efficient operational execution and strategic value-added mix in business, along with rising demand for building and infrastructure services, would drive its bottom line in the upcoming release.In the last few months, Jacobs secured several contracts from renowned institutions and public-sector agencies like the U.S. Army, EQUATE Petrochemical Company, Exxon Mobil Corporation, TransCanada Corporation, Sellafield Ltd, NASA, Saudi Aramco BASF, Suncor Energy, Sipchem Lubrizol, Kraton Corporation and Codelco. Such lucrative deals are expected to escalate the company's revenues in the impending quarter.However, dismal pricing conditions within the oil and gas market have been hurting Jacobs' Petroleum & Chemicals segment. The conclusion of several field services projects is weighing over its Industrial businesses. Persistence of these issues could weaken the company's top-line performance.Although Jacobs believes that it is in a position to win medium and large-sized chemical derivative prospects throughout the world, a stronger U.S. currency might hurt foreign revenues and earnings in the quarter. This is because a strengthening dollar raises the prices of the company's construction services and subsequently, renders them less competent in markets with relatively lower exchange rates.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Jacobs will beat on earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as we will see below.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: Jacobs currently has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate and Zacks Consensus Estimate are both pegged at 79 cents.Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. QuoteZacks Rank: Jacobs carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.  Stocks to ConsiderIn the last three months, Jacobs’ shares have lost 3.64%, wider than the industry’s loss of 3.12%.Some companies from the sector with the right combination of elements to beat estimates are listed below:Jeld-Wen Holding Inc. (JELD  -  Free Report), with an Earnings ESP of +7.69% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Thor Industries, Inc.

135,JEC,"On Jul 14, we issued an updated research report on premium technical services company, Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. (JEC  -  Free Report).Over the last three months, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock yielded a return of 1.48%, as against 2.97% loss incurred by the Zacks categorized Engineering/R&D Services industry.Notably, the attractiveness of this stock as a current investment choice is further accentuated by its favorable Vale Growth Momentum Style Score ‘A’.Current PictureRise in construction spending in the U.S., as well as robust demand for building and infrastructure services in the Asian end markets are anticipated to bolster Jacobs’ revenues in the quarters ahead. Moreover, the company’s contract-based growth strategy will likely boost top- and bottom-line performances in the near term. For instance, over the last few months, Jacobs secured several contracts from renowned institutions and public-sector agencies like the U.S. Army, EQUATE Petrochemical Company, Florida's Turnpike Enterprise, Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) and Codelco. Notably, higher transportation spending of the government authorities of Australia, the UK and the U.S. has increased Jacobs’ contract winning opportunities.  However, the company noted that the challenging conditions prevailing in the oil and gas market might continue to weigh over its Petroleum & Chemicals segment’s performance.In addition, we believe that headwinds such as stiff industry rivalry or adverse foreign currency translation impact might thwart the company’s growth, moving ahead.Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the stock remained unchanged for both fiscal 2017 and 2018, reflecting neutral sentiments.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the industry are listed below:KB Home (KBH  -  Free Report) has an average positive earnings surprise of 12.47% for the last four quarters and currently boasts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).
