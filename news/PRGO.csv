1,PRGO,"Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) jumped Monday after rival Perrigo (PRGO) said it expects the Food and Drug Administration to delay its generic version of Teva's asthma inhaler called ProAir.In afternoon trading on the stock market today, Teva popped 5.5%, to close at 20.38, nearing a three-month high. Teva stock is consolidating with a buy point at 22.74. Perrigo, on the other hand, dipped 3.3% to 74.94.Despite the delay, Canaccord analyst Dewey Steadman kept his buy rating and 105 price target on Perrigo. Steadman now expects Perrigo to launch its generic ProAir in 2020.""While the delay for Perrigo's generic ProAir is clearly disappointing, we're impressed with the quick disclosure of the expected (complete response letter) and the company's efforts to frame the impact of the product to 2018 results,"" he said in a note to clients.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseOn Friday, Perrigo said the FDA will likely delay its generic ProAir, though the firm didn't say why. Previously, Perrigo had expected to launch its copycat in the fourth quarter of 2018. It had expected generic ProAir to be worth 9 cents in full-year earnings per share and had guided to $5.05-$5.45 a share in overall profits on its May 8 quarterly earnings conference call.Steadman noted the difficulties with developing an asthma product. GlaxoSmithKline's (GSK) Advair also faces mounting competition. Teva launched a generic in 2017 and Mylan (MYL) is expected to launch one this year. But he sees the delay for generic ProAir as ""relatively minor.""""As evidenced with generic Advair development and now ProAir, it's been extremely difficult to develop generics for inhaled products and we're not certain of the timeline for a potential ProAir launch,"" he said.For Teva, Perrigo's delay means there are no other potential makers of generic ProAir in 2018, Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan said in a note. ProAir generated $350 million in U.S. sales in 2017.Still, Teva is facing a number of other issues as it attempts to restructure under new Chief Executive Kare Schultz. Its plan, unveiled in February, cuts the workforce by 14,000, closes several plants and terminates a slew of specialty programs in an effort to save $3 billion.""While a delay in generic competition would be a benefit to Teva's top line, this is obviously a rather minor positive relative to the other challenges the company is currently facing,"" Divan said. He sees ProAir adding $20 million to $40 million quarterly through mid-2019.Divan has an outperform rating and 23 price target on Teva.RELATED:How Do You Spot A Major Market Top?

6,PRGO,"Tesaro (TSRO) took a swipe at AstraZeneca's (AZN) third-quarter sales report Thursday, suggesting $10 million of the revenue it recorded for ovarian cancer drug Lynparza was inventory buildup, not necessarily patients switching from its rival drug Zejula.XLynparza in the U.S. brought in $37 million in sales, beating the consensus for $29 million, RBC analyst Kennen MacKay said. The 61% sequential growth, in timing with a broader label for Lynparza, suggests AstraZeneca could be taking share from Tesaro, he said.AstraZeneca, Tesaro and Clovis Oncology (CLVS) all make drugs to treat ovarian cancer. These rivaling drugs belong to a class called PARP inhibitors. In August, Lynparza gained a broader label that allows it to treat a bigger population of ovarian cancer patients with a tablet.Following that, AstraZeneca noted ""an immediate encouraging uplift in new patient starts.""But Tesaro said Thursday after AstraZeneca's earnings release that data from health care tracker IMS implies 13% growth in demand during the quarter, MacKay said in a later note to clients. That would equate to $26 million in third-quarter sales for Lynparza.""We believe reported sales include approximately $10 million of stocking of Lynparza capsules before withdrawal from the market and Lynparza tablets prior to launch, which would be anticipated ahead of the transition,"" Tesaro reportedly told MacKay and other analysts.IBD'S TAKE: AstraZeneca has an IBD Composite Rating of 70 out of a best-possible 99, making it the seventh in its Medical-Ethical Drugs industry group. Get a look at better-rated stocks by visiting IBD Stock Checkup.Tesaro also believes about half of Lynparza use is outside of ovarian cancer to treat breast and prostate cancers. This would have contributed to the majority of sequential demand for Lynparza, the firm reportedly said.Tesaro estimates about a quarter of the ovarian cancer maintenance market has been penetrated by PARP inhibitors. Maintenance therapies help to avoid or slow a cancer's return if the cancer is in complete remission after the initial treatment.""Zejula has approximately a 60% share of the PARP inhibitors being used in ovarian cancer,"" Tesaro told the analysts. ""More than 90% of Zejula use is in patients with ovarian, fallopian and primary peritoneal cancer.""AstraZeneca's press release doesn't detail whether inventory buildup is included in its Lynparza sales figure for the quarter. AstraZeneca representatives told Investor's Business Daily the firm doesn't share the breakdown of net sales for its products.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Tesaro had tanked 7.6% to close at 91.01. This follows its own earnings report Wednesday in which sales of Zejula lagged the consensus by about $2 million. AstraZeneca fell 0.7% to 33.11. Clovis dipped 2.3% to finish at 67.21.Outside of its PARP inhibitor, AstraZeneca's total sales for the quarter grew 9% to $6.23 billion and topped the consensus for $5.75 billion. The firm also posted 54 cents earnings per share, down 32%, and lagging analysts' view for 57 cents.AstraZeneca updated its full-year guidance. It now expects core earnings per share to be at the low side of a low- to midteens percentage decline, on a constant-currency basis. The company maintained its guidance for a low to mid single-digit percentage decline in sales.Shares of drugmaker Perrigo (PRGO) rocketed to a 12-month high after the firm crushed analysts' expectations for the third-quarter. At the close, Perrigo jumped 8.4% to 87.99, after earlier rising as much as 13%.Perrigo's sales declined 2% to $1.23 billion, but that topped analysts' forecasts for $1.17 billion in sales. Adjusted income of $1.39 per share advanced 13% and smashed the consensus of analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research for adjusted earnings of $1.12 per share.Perrigo's consumer health care business in the U.S. declined 2% to $599 million and internationally fell 3% to $365 million. The company credited this to ""actions taken last year to sell nonprofitable businesses."" Prescription pharmaceutical sales dipped 1% to $251 million.But the company boosted its guidance for adjusted earnings to $4.80-$4.95 per share.RELATED:Why Tesaro's $2 Million Cancer-Drug Miss Prompted Its Rivals To ToppleNektar, Acadia Pop On Street-Crushing Quarters, But Tesaro DipsIncyte Rises On A Beat-And-Raise, Expanding Deal With AstraZeneca

10,PRGO,"Everyone knows high prescription drug prices are a problem, but except for pharma stockholders, few people may realize that price cuts are rippling through the generic side of the industry.Take a look at recent events: Tumbling U.S. generic drug prices wiped out billions of dollars in market value in August for the likes of Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA), Mylan (MYL) and Dr. Reddy's Laboratories (RDY). That compounded the industry's woes after a brutal second-quarter earnings season.The relatively small contingent of pharma companies that produce cheaper versions of brand-name drugs is getting broadsided by players in the distribution chain. For one, leading wholesalers are squeezing drugmakers for lower prices to undercut one another in the battle for pharmacy contracts. Meanwhile, group-purchasing organizations are consolidating and grabbing onto more negotiating power, representing a hurdle for generics which comprise a large chunk of those purchases.Analysts say it could be six to nine months before prices stabilize — if they ever recover at all. While that means lower prices for patients, drugmakers are taking the brunt of the battle. Prices have clearly deteriorated in the aftermath of contract negotiations, Evercore analyst Umer Raffat said in an Aug. 12 audio report.""And the question really is: What does that mean going forward?,"" he said. ""Because if you look at the way Mylan and Teva stocks have behaved and you look at the way their estimates have been revised, it clearly suggests a material worsening in business.""Teva stock lost 50.7% in August, though it has recovered 7.9% this month, and the No. 1 drugmaker by market cap is close to losing that status. Since July 31, Teva's market value has fallen by nearly half to $17.56 billion. Comparatively, Mylan trails at a $16.85 billion cap.Teva isn't the only one feeling the pain. Selling pressures shaved $4 billion off Mylan's market capitalization in August, and its shares have toppled 19% since the beginning of August after particularly disheartening quarterly reports. As a whole, Investor's Business Daily's Generic Drugs industry group is down 6.6% year to date after nearing a four-year low in August. It's ranked No. 160 out of the 197 groups tracked by IBD.The underlying cause of the price erosion stems back to 2013-14, when drugmakers spiked prices based on shortages, monopolies and other opportunities, Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan told IBD.""If something was $10 per day, you would see it up to $15 per day because you're the only one making it and there was no competition,"" he said. ""If there's no one else producing it, you have more flexibility (in how you price a drug).""""Now that card is gone,"" he said.IBD'S TAKE: Teva has an IBD Composite Rating of 5 out of a best-possible 99, meaning it performs in the bottom 5% of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. The top-ranked generic drugmaker is Ani Pharmaceuticals, which has a middling CR of 61. Visit IBD Stock Checkup for a look at the stocks.That's not only because competition is more fierce, it's also that generics face another adversary: heavy scrutiny from the media and in Washington. In January, then President-elect Donald Trump accused drugmakers of ""getting away with murder"" in their pricing. Now, he's aiming to use competition to undercut prices.Complicating matters, some drugmakers — Teva, Mylan and Perrigo (PRGO) included — are under investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice for alleged generic drug price fixing. Last month, two members of Congress sent letters to makers of multiple sclerosis drugs to probe rising drug prices.That's yet another wrench in the generic story, Divan says.""Investors are looking for cleaner stories,"" he said. ""And there's too much unknown here.""Teva and Mylan, on their second-quarter earnings calls, projected price erosion in the high-single digits for the rest of 2017. Mylan specified that erosion would take place in its North American generics unit. That followed lackluster quarterly reports from both. Mylan's North American sales declined 9%, while Teva's numbers were helped by the acquisition of Actavis Generics.Both Teva and Mylan cut their 2017 forecasts. On their calls, executives from the two companies acknowledged an increase in generic approvals from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration was champing at sales. New FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb is looking to speed up generic approvals even more to help ease drug prices, which is in line with Trump's vision.""During the quarter we saw increased competition resulting from FDA's focus on accelerating the approvals of third, fourth or fifth generics,"" Mylan President Rajiv Malik said. ""Unfortunately, we have not seen the same for the first generics nor for more complex and niche products.""As a result, Mylan said it would delay launching generic versions of the GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) asthma drug Advair and Teva's multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone amid the ""uncertain U.S. regulatory environment.""Teva's former interim chief executive, Yitzhak Peterburg, cited customer consolidation, an increase in FDA generic-drug approvals and products that were either delayed or subject to more competition for ""accelerated price erosion and decreased volume"" in the second quarter.FDA approval complications were cited across second-quarter reports, Mizuho analyst Irina Koffler said in an Aug. 17 report to clients. Though generic approvals are catching some wind under the FDA's new goal, complex generics — a molecular copy that also has a complex active ingredient, formulation, route or device combination — have been subject to administrative delays.Koffler sees Mylan as best-positioned to rebound despite its tie to the challenged generics sector. The firm has a pipeline of complex generics and biosimilars, guidance is now more realistic and it's less levered than its peers, meaning it could pursue acquisitions of companies whose stocks have dropped.""The risks are that pricing pressure in the U.S. may not abate, and the overall profitability of the company is declining as it expands into lower-margin international markets that now comprise a greater percentage of its revenue,"" she said.A few drugmakers seemingly escaped the second-quarter malaise. But those reports were somewhat misleading, CFRA analyst Jeffrey Loo told IBD.Perrigo issued a beat-and-raise that helped its stock fly 16% in a day. Though Perrigo's generic drug sales toppled 13% year over year, its separate consumer health segments had smaller 4% and 9% declines in the U.S. and internationally, respectively.Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) crushed second-quarter profit views, though sales came in a hair light. The firm also cut its 2017 revenue target, but kept its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization forecast.""A lot of people consider Valeant as a generic play, but the bulk of the business is now Bausch & Lomb"" eye-care products, Loo said. In the quarter, revenue from Bausch & Lomb as well as Salix, its gastrointestinal-drugs division, represented 73% of total sales. Its smaller generics unit, on the other hand, fell by 33%.""If you exclude Valeant from the generic space and Perrigo, none of these generic drugmakers really bucked the trend in the second quarter,"" Loo said. ""I think that it (pressure on the group) will likely continue going forward for the next two quarters.""Teva leads the U.S. generic drugs sector, but it's also under the most pressure, Steven Schoenfeld, chief information officer of BlueStar Indexes, told IBD. BlueStar Indexes tracks Israeli equities. Cybersecurity play Check Point Software Technologies (CHKP) is now bigger than Teva in terms of market cap, at $18.18 billion.Former Teva Chief Executive Erez Vigodman stepped down in February amid a bribery investigation. Since then, management has been shaky and the firm's strategy has been out of kilter, Schoenfeld says. This followed its loss of several key patents protecting MS drug Copaxone in January. In September, Teva named former Lundbeck and Novo Nordisk (NVO) veteran Kare Schultz as its new chief executive officer.Still, Teva is splitting its focus between generic and branded drugs, Schoenfeld says.""They need a strategy,"" he said. ""They need to see if they want to expand or continue to invest in blockbuster drugs. They've now got some early-stage Alzheimer's assets and other drugs. They have to decide if they're going to be X percentage generic and, if so, do the profits go into innovation?""Meanwhile, debt has rocketed and investors are no longer sure the $40.5 billion Teva paid to acquire Actavis Generics from Allergan (AGN) was a good price, he says. As of June 30, Teva had $35.1 billion in debt, rising from $34.6 billion at the end of March.Under Schultz, Teva recently avoided a covenant violation on its debt. On Sept. 19, Teva said it amended several term loans and revolving credit facilities, ""providing Teva greater flexibility in its financial leverage ratio covenants.""The question at the forefront now is whether the U.S. generic drugs sector has hit a bottom.In recent history, Mylan has come under scrutiny for the pricing of its emergency allergy injection, EpiPen. Turing Pharmaceuticals' former chief executive, Martin Shkreli, drew criticism for spiking the price of a decades-old HIV drug. Teva is among those being looked at for MS drug prices.""Popular culture has turned against it,"" BlueStar's Schoenfeld said. ""Secular trends aren't going to go away. The market sees pricing pressure. Have these stocks priced in the worst? Teva is trading where it had major support in the 2001-03 time frame. But I wouldn't recommend anyone plunge into Teva.""Most firms are now trading at four to five times their earnings, CFRA's Loo says. Amid continuing price erosion, he sees the stocks trading sideways for the next six months. He notes there aren't many drugs going off patent in the near future, causing somewhat of a roadblock for new generics.""I would like to hope they've hit a bottom,"" he said. ""There are not that many catalysts for them going forward. You might see some buyers step in and buy shares of these companies. Four to five times earnings is an awfully attractive valuation.""RELATED:Biogen, Teva Slip After Democrats Launch MS Drug Pricing ProbeThis Toppling Generic Drugmaker Could Be Poised For A Rebound: AnalystHow A Falling Generic Drugmaker Got An Analyst's UpgradeGeneric Drugs Are Rebound Despite Teva, Mylan Free-FallPerrigo's Beat-And-Raise Lifts Generic Drugs, Bucks Teva-Mylan Trend

She has a neutral rating on Endo.IBD'S TAKE: Mylan has an IBD Composite Rating of 36, meaning it outperforms about a third of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. But that's out of a best-possible 99. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a look at better-rated drug stocks.For Teva, one of the biggest obstacles is its debt which, as of June 30, was $35.1 billion after it needed to finance the acquisition of Actavis Generics. Teva's debt is nearly double its $17.96 billion market cap.Mylan and Teva both cut guidance in the second half of 2017 after issuing quarterly results that lagged the consensus. Perrigo (PRGO) beat the trend, though, soon after reporting Wall Street-topping metrics and boosting its guidance.RELATED:Generic Drugs Are Rebounding Despite Teva, Mylan Free-FallPerrigo Beat-And-Raise Lifts Generic Drugs, Bucks Teva-Mylan TrendCan Generic Drug Stocks Catch A Break After Mylan's Crash?

12,PRGO,"Perrigo (PRGO) shot to a six-month high Thursday after bucking weakness in its generic drug business and the industry overall by topping second-quarter expectations and raising its 2017 guidance.XIn morning trading on the stock market today, Perrigo popped 18%, near 78.30, after earlier spiking as much as 20.4% to touch a high last seen in late February. Meanwhile, generic drug stocks collectively rebounded 3.5%.Generic drug stocks have been under pressure this month. Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) and Mylan (MYL), which lead the group, reported lackluster quarterly results and cut guidance. The entire group traded down for 12 straight days, but began recovering Wednesday.Early Thursday, Perrigo reported $1.24 billion in sales and adjusted earnings of $1.22 per share, topping the consensus for $1.18 billion and 92 cents, respectively, Canaccord analyst Dewey Steadman wrote in a note to clients.But its generics unit is becoming less important, Steadman said. Perrigo's beat arrived on the back of its consumer business while generics declined 13% year over year in part on lower sales of Crohn's disease drug Entocort.IBD'S TAKE: Biotechs are better-rated than generic drug stocks. Perrigo has an IBD Composite Rating of 5 out of a best-possible 99, meaning it underperforms most stocks in terms of key growth metrics. Celgene (CELG) leads the biotech group with a CR of 99. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a look at top-rated stocks.On a year-over-year basis, consumer sales in the Americas and internationally declined a respective 4% and 9% after Perrigo sold off unprofitable businesses last year. Excluding the impact of those sales, revenue grew 3% and 4%, respectively.""This is in stark contrast to Perrigo's current large-generic peer set facing significant pricing challenges and existential growth issues in recent quarterly announcements,"" Steadman said.The consumer unit behaves materially different from U.S. generics, Steadman noted. He expects Perrigo to shift further toward a consumer-driven business over time and, on that ""significant opportunity,"" he kept a buy rating and 80 price target on Perrigo.Perrigo also raised its 2017 guidance to adjusted income of $4.45-$4.70 per share vs. earlier views for $4.15-$4.50, and topping consensus views for $4.28, Steadman said.RELATED:Can Generic Drug Stocks Catch A Break After Mylan's Crash?How Teva's 40% Crash Over Three Days Is Hurting Generic DrugmakersTeva Crashes To 13-Year Low On 'Very Tough Quarter'

13,PRGO,"Generic drug maker Mylan (MYL) continued its free-fall Friday while rival Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA) managed to briefly arrest its slide, but broader generics led by Eagle Pharmaceuticals (EGRX) defied the trend and spiked higher for the third straight day.XIn afternoon trading on the stock market today, IBD's 17-company Generic Drugs industry group popped 3.3% to its highest point since Aug. 3, the day Teva reported second-quarter earnings and sales that missed, and cut guidance.Generic drug stocks broadly traded down for 12 consecutive days, but began to recover earlier this week. Eagle and Aclaris Therapeutics (ACRS) led the group midday Friday, rising a respective 11.1% and9%. Perrigo (PRGO), which offered a quarterly beat-and-raise this week, popped 2.2%, near 78.90.Analysts expected Perrigo's generic drugs business to topple in the quarter following disappointments from Teva and Mylan. Its generics business did decline 13%, but strength in its consumer-driven business was enough to help Perrigo top expectations.Perrigo shot up 15.8% Thursday on its second-quarter report. It's ""amazing what one good quarter can do,"" UBS analyst Marc Goodman wrote in a research report. He has a buy rating and an 84 price target on Perrigo.Goodman noted Perrigo did the unexpected — it increased its net sales guidance for 2017 in its generic drugs unit. Perrigo bumped its expected generics sales to $950 million, from earlier views for $925 million, due to earlier-than-expected launches of new products.""But the significant move in the stock was also due to solid upside from both consumer businesses in combination with cost-cutting execution, which is driving margin improvement, which appears to be sustainable,"" Goodman said.IBD'S TAKE: Inflation could have had a part to play in some earnings misses. Head to IBD's Economy page to see how Teva and others could have been impacted.Perrigo boosted its generics guide despite calling for 9%-11% year-over-year erosion in generic drug prices for the second half of the year.In a separate report, Goodman nearly halved his price target on Teva to 19 from 34, though he kept a neutral rating. He expects Teva to see generic competition to its multiple-sclerosis drug Copaxone in the first quarter of 2018 after losing several key patents earlier this year.""More importantly, we have significantly lowered the U.S. generics numbers, both topline and margins, based on how management sees the new generics landscape,"" he wrote. ""Our analysis suggest this is not a buying opportunity; hence, we remain neutral on the stock.""Goodman assumes Teva's U.S. generics business will likely decline 3%-4% on average from 2017-21, decreasing from $5.4 billion to $4.7 billion. This will be ""driven by a base erosion of about 11% that would be partially offset by new product launches,"" he said.Teva expects U.S. generics revenue will decline in 2018-19. It's looking to save money by closing down manufacturing facilities, as well as synergies through the Allergan (AGN) generics deal. Teva acquired Allergan's generics business last August.RELATED:Perrigo's Beat-And-Raise Lifts Generic Drugs, Bucks Teva-Mylan TrendHow Teva's 40% Crash Over Three Days Is Hurting Generic DrugmakersAstraZeneca Pops On Report Its CEO Won't Jump Ship For Teva Pharma

Lumentum management said it has $200 million in orders for 3D devices in calendar 2017 and manufacturing yields have been solid.

16,PRGO,"Mylan (MYL) hit a four-year low, taking generic drug stocks with it after reporting second-quarter metrics that lagged Wall Street and cutting guidance for the next two years, but then recovered to post a slight gain Wednesday.XOn the stock market today, Mylan ended the trading day up 0.9% to 32.08 after earlier falling as much as 7%, hitting a low last seen in June 2013. This is the sixth consecutive day Mylan has spent in the red following a disappointing report from fellow generic drugmaker Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA).The crash initially sent IBD's 17-company Generic Drugs industry group down as much as 2.4%, but the sector recovered in recent trades, rising nearly 1% at the close. Still, Taro Pharmaceutical (TARO), Collegium Pharmaceutical (COLL) and Perrigo (PRGO) remained down 7.3%, 5.4% and 0.3%, respectively.For its second quarter ended June 30, Mylan reported $2.96 billion in sales, up 16% year over year, but that missed the consensus for $3 billion. Adjusted earnings of $1.10 per share lagged by 9 cents and fell 5%.Revenue in North America was hit hardest, down 9%, as sales in Europe and the rest of the world grew 59% and 29%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier period. Sales of its EpiPen injection for allergic reactions declined due to increased competition.IBD'S TAKE: Mylan has an IBD Composite Rating of 46, meaning it performs in the bottom half of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. Get a look at better-rated stocks via IBD Stock Checkup.Mylan also cut its guidance for 2017 to $11.5 billion-$12.5 billion in sales and adjusted profit of $4.30-$4.70 a share. For 2018, it now sees adjusted earnings of ""at least $5.40,"" down from earlier views for $6. The new target would be 20% above 2017 expectations, at the midpoint.""Given the region's ongoing challenges and uncertain U.S. regulatory environment, we have elected to defer all major U.S. launches from our full-year 2017 financial guidance to 2018, including generic Advair and Copaxone,"" Mylan said in a news release.Advair is used to prevent asthma attacks and flare-ups of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. It's branded by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), but Mylan and others are working on generic versions of it. In May, the Food and Drug Administration delayed Mylan's application for the drug.Mylan and others are also working on a generic version of Teva's multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone, which lost four key patents earlier in the year.The Medicines Company (MDCO) popped despite lagging second-quarter revenue, on losses that beat expectations and promising clinical updates, including an LDL cholesterol-lowering drug that could rival Amgen (AMGN), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Sanofi (SNY).Medicines Co. noted during the second quarter that it came to agreements with regulators in the U.S. and Europe over its drug, inclisiran, as a cholesterol-buster. In total, it expects to enroll 3,400 patients in a Phase 3 trial designed to support the submission of applications for its approval.Inclisiran is what's known as a PCSK9 synthesis inhibitor, which has a slightly different mechanism than PSCK9 inhibitors from Amgen and Regeneron/Sanofi. Medicines Co. is also working on a study of 14,000 patients to determine whether there's a cardiovascular benefit from inclisiran.For its second quarter ended June 30, Medicines Co. reported $18.7 million in sales, down 66%. That missed the consensus of analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research for $31 million in revenue.Adjusted losses of $1.02 per share widened from a 69-cent loss in the year-earlier period. But that topped the consensus' view for an adjusted loss of $1.29 per share.Medicines Co. lifted 3.9%, to close at 37.71.RELATED:Tesaro Beats Sales Views But Losses Up; Nektar Misses On EarnsHow Teva's 40% Crash Over Three Days Is Hurting Generic DrugmakersMylan In FDA Limbo On Generic Multiple Sclerosis Drug

17,PRGO,"Stocks stuck very close to home on Thursday as mixed economic data and earnings reports frayed any attempts to build momentum.Better-than-expected weekly jobless claims and June consumer confidence numbers were positive, but a sharp drop in manufacturing growth reported by the Philadelphia Fed before the open helped stoke investor concerns. Investor response to earnings reports cut sharply in both directions, although mostly in soft trade, throughout the session.The result gave the Nasdaq a technical win: another new high and its 10th straight gain. But the increase was less than 0.1%, and in weak trade — no mean feat with Check Point Software (CHKP), TripAdvisor (TRIP) and Qualcomm (QCOM) all turning in broad losses, and Apple (AAPL), Netflix (NFLX) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) ending with minor losses on the day.Drugmakers Mylan (MYL) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) led the Nasdaq 100.

Drugmakers were key leaders also, with Perrigo (PRGO) and Mallinckrodt (MNK) each posting 4% gains, although trade was weak.The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 0.1%, despite the valiant efforts of Nike (NKE), which bucked up more than 2% for the day. The stock has fallen below its 59.10 buy point, but the breakout at that entry remains in play.Home Depot (HD) fell 4%, ratcheting up the drag on the Dow. The catalyst appeared to be an agreement by Sears Holdings (SHLD) to sell its respected Kenmore-brand home appliances via Amazon.com (AMZN). The news sent Sears shares to a nearly 11% gain. Amazon sketched out a 0.2% advance.Macom Technology Solutions (MTSI) led the IBD 50, up more than 3% in above-average trade. That was sufficient to take out a new high, although shares were already extended after an early July rebound from the 10-week moving average. The chipmaker plans to report its fiscal third-quarter results on Aug. 1.On the down side, Floor & Decor (FND) tumbled 6% in fast trade, falling back below its 10-week moving average.

19,PRGO,"Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) said Thursday it increased the price of its multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone to partially offset a 4% dip in global first-quarter sales — but shares fell as total revenue missed Wall Street's views.On the stock market today, Teva stock rose 2% to 32 after earlier falling as much as 3.7%. Shares are down for the year amid an antitrust probe into generics including Teva, Mylan (MYL) and Perrigo (PRGO).For the first quarter ended March 31, Teva reported adjusted income of $1.06 a share on $5.63 billion in sales. Profits topped by 3 cents, but declined 14% year over year. Sales missed the $5.68 billion view, but grew 17% vs. last year.Generic medicine sales of $3.1 billion grew 24% and comprised 54% of total sales, up from the 51% chunk it represented in the year-earlier period. Teva noted its acquisition of Actavis helped boost the segment in the quarter. Revenue from Teva's specialty drug unit declined 6% to $2 billion.Teva blamed lower sales of its central nervous system and respiratory drugs for the decrease in specialty medicines. To help offset that, Teva received a $75 million payment from a Takeda subsidiary which bought the royalties and rights to multiple myeloma drug Ninlaro.Copaxone, though, saw 4% fewer sales in the quarter. In the U.S., revenue for the multiple sclerosis drug fell 5% to $782 million ""partially offset by a price increase of 7.9% for both Copaxone products in January 2017,"" Teva said. Teva sells 20-milligram and 40-milligram doses of Copaxone.IBD'S TAKE: Generic drug stocks toppled last week after federal officials searched Perrigo's offices as part of a widespread price-fixing investigation.

In February, a Delaware court ruled invalid four key patents protecting the drug, siding with Mylan. Pfizer (PFE) and Momenta Pharmaceuticals (MNTA) are working on Copaxone copies.Respiratory products also toppled 17% in the first quarter, bringing in $304 million in revenue. Sales from asthma inhalers ProAir and Qvar declined 30% and 27%, respectively. Teva noted that wholesaler and retailer inventory reductions, as well as net pricing effects, played into the dips.Teva also said Michael McClellan will serve as interim chief financial officer, effective July 1, following the planned departure of Eyal Desheh. Before joining Teva, McClellan had a 20-year-plus career at Sanofi (SNY).RELATED:Mylan Q1 Revenue Falls Short Of Views As EpiPen Sales DeclineTeva Downgraded On Lost MS Drug Patents, DOJ Probe

20,PRGO,"X The market ended May with a dull thud, running losses of 0.1% across the Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average.It was the Nasdaq's seventh straight monthly advance, ending up 2.4% for May. The S&P 500 managed a 1.1% gain, while the Dow industrials eked out only the thinnest of fractional advances.Data played a key role in Wednesday's action, with the Dow industrials, Nasdaq and S&P 500 opening higher, then reversing sharply after the release of the Chicago Purchasing Manager Index for May at 9:45 a.m. ET, although a corrected version of the PMI showed a much stronger report.The first release of the Chicago PMI showed a reading of 55.2, down hard from the prior month's 58.3 tally and below the consensus view for 57.5. The corrected version showed a May reading of 59.4, its highest mark in 2-1/2 years and well above forecasts.Overnight data out of China showed better-than-expected manufacturing growth in May, but the steel, equipment and mining stocks that would normally react positively to such news came under pressure early in the session. In addition, claims from Libya that production had recovered to above its long-term ceiling of 800,900 barrels helped send crude prices down almost 3%, to $48.32 a barrel, leaving it down 2% for the month.Stocks fell, then gradually regained ground after the release of the Federal Reserve's May Beige Book, which showed continued modest growth, but increasing signs that optimism could be flagging. The report was closely watched because it's the last Beige Book report ahead of the Fed's meeting on interest rates in June, when a majority of investors expect another increase in rates.Pfizer (PFE) led the Dow industrials, up 1.6% after announcing that both the Food & Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency had accepted its submissions to expand the approved use of Sutent to include treatment for recurrent renal cell carcinoma in patients following kidney surgery. Pfizer shares are working on their first weekly advance since late April.Pressure on the S&P 500 came from Michael Kors (KORS), Tenet Healthcare (THC), Southwestern Energy (SWN) and Goldman Sachs (GS).Goldman and JPMorgan (JPM) drove the downside among Dow stocks.  Goldman tumbled 3% and JPMorgan 2% following the revelation by JPMorgan's CFO Marianne Lake, speaking at an investor conference, that the firm's trading revenue was down 15% year over year.Losses were more subdued on the Nasdaq, with O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY) and Baidu (BIDU) hardest hit, down 2% apiece. At the top of the Nasdaq 100, Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) rose 2.7%, taking a new high.Analog Devices (ADI) thrashed 7% higher at the open, then backtracked to close 1% higher in big trade. The Norwood, Mass.-company reported a big fiscal Q2 earnings win and delivered Q3 revenue and earnings guidance above analyst expectations. Shares ended in a buy range from an 84.34 buy point in a flat base.IBD 50 stock Control4 (CTRL) roared 8% higher in big trade. Needham upgraded the connected-home software developer to buy, with a 22 price target. The stock is extended after an April rebound from the 10-week moving average.Drugmaker Perrigo (PRGO) led the S&P 500, up 6% after a strong first-quarter report. But the stock remains deep in a 26-month consolidation.RELATED:3 Tech Leaders Near Highs As Earnings Loom: Investing Action Plan Here's Why You Should Look At Semtech, Broadcom Before Earnings

21,PRGO,"Generic drug stocks crashed Wednesday on news the Department of Justice has conducted a search at Perrigo's (PRGO) offices related to a widespread price-fixing investigation that is also looking at Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA) and Mylan (MYL).In early trading on the stock market today, IBD's 17-company Medical-Generic Drugs industry group fell a collective 4.5% to a two-week low. Lannett Company (LCI) and Perrigo stocks lost the most, down 18.6% and 5.1%, respectively. Lannett missed third-quarter earnings estimates late Tuesday.Perrigo declined to comment beyond a press release, which confirmed authorities executed the search warrants at Perrigo's corporate offices.""As has been previously disclosed by a number of companies, the (Justice Department's) antitrust division has been looking at industrywide pricing practices,"" Perrigo's release said. ""The company is taking this investigation seriously and is cooperating with the appropriate authorities.""The investigation centers on potential price collusion among a dozen companies. It's illegal for companies to agree on a set price or corporate discounts. In Perrigo's case, the Justice Department is looking at the price of its skin drugs, Bloomberg reported.Other drugmakers under investigation are Allergan (AGN), Impax Laboratories (IMPX), Covis Pharma, Sun Pharmaceutical, Mayne Pharma, Taro Pharmaceuticals (TARO) and Endo International (ENDP), a subsidiary of Par Pharmaceutical.IBD'S TAKE: Keep up with pharma news by visiting IBD's Biotech And Pharma Industry And Stock News page.Mylan told Investor's Business Daily last year it received a subpoena regarding doxycycline, an antibiotic, but hadn't been asked for information on the pricing tactics of digoxin, a blood pressure drug. It was also searched.In January, Jeffrey Glazer and Jason Malek, two former executives at generic drug maker Heritage Pharmaceuticals, pleaded guilty to a price-fixing agreement with other drugmakers.RELATED:Teva CEO Steps Down After Patent Losses, Bribery Settlement; Stock DivesKite, Ionis Outplay Med Sector As Perrigo, Tenet, Valeant DivePerrigo Shares Plunge On Plan To Sell MS-Drug Royalty Stream

22,PRGO,"Shares of Perrigo Co. (PRGO) plunged 10% in after-hours trading Monday as the Ireland-based drugmaker announced plans to divest its rights to the royalty stream from multiple sclerosis drug Tysabri to RPI Finance Trust for $2.85 billion.In a press release, Perrigo said $2.2 billion from the deal would come in cash, and it would receive up to $650 million in milestone payments based on future Tysabri net sales in 2018 and 2020.Shares of Perrigo were down nearly 10% to 76.30 in after-hours trading after closing up a fraction at 84.68 in the regular session.

Net sales came in at $5.6 billion, topping analyst views for $5.45 billion. Losses per share minus items are expected to hit $28.85-$29, ""primarily due to goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges of $5.4 billion,"" Perrigo said.For 2017, Perrigo guided to $6.30-$6.65 earnings per share minus items, which lags the consensus views for $7.10. Net sales guidance for $5 billion to $5.2 billion was light, missing Wall Street views for $5.43 billion.IBD'S TAKE: Perrigo stock has a low IBD Composite Rating of 16, meaning it underperforms more than eight in 10 stocks across all sectors in terms of key growth metrics.

23,PRGO,"Kite Pharma (KITE) outperformed med stocks Tuesday, gapping up on lymphoma trial results even as Perrigo (PRGO) and Tenet Healthcare (THC) made double-digit plunges, leading similar declines for Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) and Akorn (AKRX).By the closing bell on the stock market today, Kite stock had rocketed 24.3% to 70.66. Shares traded in a buy zone after hitting an entry point at 64.40 out of a consolidation period that began in August. Biotech stocks, though, were broadly down almost 1% Tuesday.Juno Therapeutics (JUNO), too, jumped more than 2.7% to 24.04 on Kite's news. Both are working on drugs to treat diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. At six months, Kite's drug, known as KTE-C19, showed a 31% complete response rate in 77 B-cell lymphoma patients, continuing the 33% response rate reported at three months.KTE-C19 achieved a best overall response rate of 82% and response rate of 49% in the patient group. Leerink analyst Michael Schmidt noted the results are ""durable,"" and also set the bar for Juno's drug, known as JCAR017. Juno plans to begin a trial using JCAR017 in the same type of lymphoma patients during 2017.Biotech Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS) saw shares charge higher by 6.1% to 49.77, well above their 50-day moving average on consensus-crushing, fourth-quarter metrics. Ionis posted 24 cents earnings per share excluding certain items, though analysts expected a 12-cent loss. Sales of $160.35 million topped by nearly $63 million.IBD'S TAKE: Want more on the biotech and pharma industry? Be sure to stop by IBD's Biotech & Pharma Stock page for best ideas in the sector.The upward stock motion Tuesday was largely limited to Kite and Ionis, though. Exelixis (EXEL) stock recovered from an earlier beating following Stifel Nicolaus analyst Stephen Willey's downgrade to a hold rating from buy. Willey cited Exelixis' inflated valuation and lack of inputs to support it for his downgrade.""Everything (is) going right"" at Exelixis, he wrote in a note. On Monday, Exelixis posted strong fourth-quarter results and announced immuno-oncology partnerships with Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and Roche (RHHBY). But shares fell 6.8% Tuesday, closing at 21.52.Tenet stock toppled 14.9% to 19.30 after reporting 6 cents earnings per share minus certain items on $4.85 billion in sales, missing the consensus of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters for 22 cents and $4.96 billion, respectively.Perrigo, though, continued on its downward stock path on Tuesday. Shares ended the day down 11.7% to 74.77 after a late Monday announcement that it would sell its royalty stream on multiple sclerosis drug Tysabri to RPI Finance Trust for $2.85 billion. Guidance for 2017 was also light.Valeant reported a strong fourth quarter with consensus-topping metrics, but shares dove 13.9% to close at 14.38 on earnings guidance for 2017 that lagged views. Valeant guided to $3.55 billion to $3.7 billion earnings before interest taxes and amortization, missing estimates for $3.88 billion.Akorn stock was walloped, falling 5.8% to 20.81 at the close.RELATED:Valeant Plunges On 2017 Earnings Outlook, 'Unrealistic' Brand SalesExelixis Rockets On Bristol, Roche I-O Ties Following Merck-Incyte TeamPerrigo Shares Plunge On Plans To Sell MS Drug Royalty Stream

24,PRGO,"No. 2 generic drugmaker Mylan (MYL) is expected late Wednesday to report a third consecutive quarter of sales growth, as well as earnings that will re-accelerate after the company dipped into the red in Q3.Mylan's Q4 report will come amid a week chock full of health-sector earnings, including biotech Supernus Pharmaceuticals (SUPN) on Tuesday and eye-care firm Glaukos (GKOS) on Wednesday. Horizon Pharma (HZNP) and Perrigo (PRGO) are slated to report their Q4 earnings on Monday.For Q4, analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Mylan to see $1.42 in earnings per share minus items on $3.18 billion in sales, up 16% and 28%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier quarter. EPS fell 3% in Q3 after 11 quarters of growth.As part of its investor day in New York, Mylan will also issue guidance for 2017. Analysts currently view sales as growing 15% to $12.7 billion and EPS minus items up 12% to $5.33.Mylan stock is up 10% for the year, well above its 50-day moving average, after a rough 2016 that saw the stock tumble 29% as CEO Heather Bresch was forced to defend a bump in the price of its EpiPen two-pack to $600. Shares fell 0.4% Friday to 42.16.IBD'S TAKE: Glaukos filed its initial public offering in August 2015, and is among several stocks outperforming the S&P 500. Head to IBD's IPO Analysis for a deep dive on Glaukos and its fellow outperforming stocks.Before year's end, though, Mylan introduced its generic EpiPen at half the cost of the branded two-pack.Also late Wednesday, glaucoma and cataract surgery firm Glaukos is slated to report $29.8 billion in sales and break-even EPS ex items. Sales are expected to grow 47% year over year. The company lost 7 cents per share in the year-earlier quarter.Glaukos stock hit a record high of 46.82 on Tuesday. Shares rose 2.9% Friday to 46.19.Late Tuesday, analysts expect Supernus to report 25 cents EPS ex items, up 79%, with revenue rising 36% to $59.5 million.Supernus stock fell 0.2% Friday to 25.30, after touching an all-time high of 27.95 at the start of the month.RELATED:Momenta, Pfizer Give Teva Breathing Room On Generic MS DrugAcorda Must Stave Off Mylan, Teva Generics To Protect Ampyra: RBCTeva Dives To 10-Year Low After 4 Copaxone Patents Invalidated

25,PRGO,"Already troubled Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) saw its stock crash to a six-year low early Tuesday after the company slashed its guidance and reported Q3 sales and earnings that toppled vs. the year-earlier quarter.In the stock market today, Valeant stock tumbled 22% to 14.98, earlier falling below 14. Shares have plunged more than 80% this year, as IBD's 44-company Medical-Ethical Drugs industry group has fallen more than 25%.For Q3, Valeant reported $2.48 billion in sales and $1.55 earnings per share ex items, down 11% and 36%, respectively, year over year. Both metrics missed the consensus of 21 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters.Valeant has missed on EPS in four of the past five quarters and on sales in three of the last four quarters. Valeant blamed the Q3 sales miss on ""a decline in product sales revenue from our existing businesses.""IBD'S TAKE: Valeant has a low Composite Rating of 7, meaning it underperforms nine in 10 of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. None of the drugmakers has a high CR. Depomed is ranked highest in the group with a CR of 74. Get the Stock Checkup for more.The company's troubles began late last year after a scandal erupted involving Valeant's relationship with a now defunct pharmacy called Philidor, which it turned out Valeant secretly had an option to acquire, and things have gone downhill since. Bloomberg reported Tuesday that U.S. regulators are trying to build a fraud case against former Valeant CEO J. Michael Pearson and former CFO Howard Schiller. New CEO Joseph Papa, who came over from Perrigo (PRGO) in April, and the executive team are striving to right the ship.The Q3 ""decline was primarily due to lower realized prices related to our ophthalmology products as a result of the implementation of rebates and other price adjustments versus prior year,"" Valeant said in a press release.Valeant's Branded Rx segment saw sales plunge 23%, and its U.S. Diversified Products unit fell 20%. In the latter segment, Valeant experienced generic competition against its neurology products.Sales of Valeant's Bausch + Lamb/International segment rose 4% to $1.16 billion. New 2015 acquisitions and higher U.S. volume product sales helped offset a $4 million decline in existing businesses.For 2016, Valeant now sees $9.55 billion to $9.65 billion in sales, down from its earlier guidance of $9.9 billion to $10.1 billion. The firm cut its EPS minus items guidance to $5.30-$5.50 from $6.60-$7.RELATED:Aerie Pharma Dips On 'Minor' Glaucoma Setback And Q3 MissValeant Shares Sell On Plan To Sell Stomach-Disorder Business

26,PRGO,"Growth-stock funds have outperformed their blend and value counterparts in the past 10 years. But the reverse is true for this year, with the average value fund up nearly 8%, the average blend fund up nearly 6% and the average growth fund up 3%.Among the growth funds that have kept pace with value funds this year is Parnassus Endeavor Fund (PARWX). The large-cap growth fund is up 12% this year. Its recent top holdings include Applied Materials (AMAT), up 56% this year, Qualcomm (QCOM) up 43% and Micron Technology (MU) up 24%.Holdings that haven't done as well include Gilead Sciences (GILD), down 24% this year, and generic-drug maker Perrigo (PRGO) down 37%.The $1.9 billion fund has been managed by Jerome Dodson since 2005.The fund seeks to buy high-quality companies that it can hold long-term. It seeks to keep about 30 companies in its portfolio, giving significant weightings to most. It has a turnover rate of 63%.Parnassus Endeavor has an environmental, social and governance (ESG) component, as holdings must offer outstanding workplaces and not be involved with oil and other fossil fuels.In his fund commentary for Q3, written in early October, Dodson said the market looked fairly valued. A decline in the number of attractive stocks helps explain why cash in the fund had built up to over 15%, way above average for stock funds. It's also way above his goal for 5% cash.""Although I would like to put some of the cash to work, I won't invest just for the sake of reducing our cash position,"" he said. ""There has to be a good idea to inspire an investment, and that means a good company trading at a very attractive price. This strategy has served us well over the years, as evidenced by our strong returns, so I'm not tempted to change our policy and lower the fund's standards just to reduce our cash balance.""Strong inflow to the fund from investors attracted by its strong performance has contributed to the cash build. Dodson encourages investors stay the course. ""Keep those investments coming in! At some point, I'll figure out what to do with the money,"" he said.Dodson professed a lack of deep concern for the likely path for interest rates.""While the immediate reaction to an interest-rate increase will probably be a drop in the stock market, longer‐term, a gradual and reasonable increase in rates will probably not depress the market for very long,"" he said in his commentary.""Rising interest rates usually mean the economy is doing better, so corporations are doing better and stocks find a way to move higher,"" he continued. ""If interest rates move higher late this year or early next year, the initial reaction may be a stock market swoon. If this happens, and stocks go down to more attractive valuations, it may provide us with an opportunity to put some of that idle cash to work.""RELATED:Parnassus' Dodson Wins With Hot Tech Stocks That Pass ESG ScreensThis Is What Fidelity Trend Likes About Apple, Amazon And AlphabetWhy A Top Columbia Fund Likes These Stock LeadersChinese, Other Foreign Stocks Drove Top Q3 Mutual Fund Performance

27,PRGO,"Shares of generic drugmaker Perrigo (PRGO), which had fallen by about half in the past year, jumped Monday after activist hedge fund investor Starboard Value announced it had taken a 4.6% ownership stake and was asking for changes at the company.""We believe that Perrigo is deeply undervalued and significant opportunities exist to create value for the benefit of all shareholders based on actions that should be within the control of management and the (board), Starboard wrote in a letter addressed to Perrigo CEO John Hendrickson. ""We believe changes are needed to reverse the trajectory of poor operating and financial performance and reposition Perrigo for future success.""We ... believe a significant opportunity exists to improve performance in Perrigo's core businesses.""Perrigo shares rose 7.35% to 95.23 in the stock market today, but they have been in a downtrend going back more than a year.IBD'S TAKE: While the generic-drug sector has been down, IBD's Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group ranks a solid No. 16 out of 197 groups. Some of our recent coverage offered advice on what to look for in earnings reports, to spot sale volume growth vs. price-hike growth, and we identified three biotechs to keep an eye on this month.Perrigo elevated Hendrickson from president to CEO in April, after the company's former CEO Joseph Papa resigned to take the top job at Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX).Generic drugmakers have been under pressure from continued price competition. IBD's 19-company Medical-Generic Drugs group has fallen more than 20% this year.Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA) on Friday gave an update on some of its products, including a competitor to the Mylan (MYL) EpiPen that it said could be on the market by late next year. The huge overall issue of high drug prices sprang up again last month as lawmakers and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton sharply criticized the $600 cost of the emergency allergy treatment.But in a research note late Sunday, RBC Capital Markets analyst Randall Stanicky was unimpressed by both Teva's update and the outlook for the sector overall. Of Teva's update, he wrote in a research note that ""we do not think it was enough to assuage pre-existing investor concerns around the overall generic outlook or drive Street numbers higher. We continue to see TEVA as best positioned, but generic sector visibility is still a challenge.""In November, Perrigo shareholders, as recommended by Perrigo management, turned down a proposed buyout from Mylan valued at $205 a share. In its letter Monday, Starboard sharply criticized that move by Perrigo management.""Unfortunately, since that time, results have gone decidedly in the wrong direction, and management's promises have been woefully unfulfilled,"" Starboard wrote. ""Specifically, the company has severely mismanaged the Omega Pharma Invest (""Omega""; now Perrigo's Branded Consumer Healthcare business) integration, committed numerous execution errors, and significantly lowered financial guidance on the past two earnings calls.""Perrigo formed its branded consumer health care business, BCH, after acquiring Omega Pharma last year. Perrigo has said the BCH has been performing weaker than expected and lowered its expectations for new product launches.RELATED:Mylan Will Make Its Own Generic Of Its Own EpiPenIs EpiPen's Price The FDA's Fault?

33,PRGO,"Drugmaker Endo International (ENDP) plunged 39% Friday after it delivered a hefty guidance cut driven by weakness in its generics business, dragging nearly every other generic-drug stock down with it.Endo actually beat analysts' consensus in Q1, but it cut its full-year earnings guidance by 23% -- now $4.50 to $4.80 a share -- and trimmed the revenue outlook by 11% to a range of $3.87 billion to $4.03 billion. In the company's earnings release, CEO Rajiv De Silva blamed ""new competitive entrants, including for Voltaren Gel; greater-than-expected price erosion across the Generics sector; and delays on regulatory actions related to certain Endo products.""IBD's Take: How healthy are shares of Endo and Teva and how do they stack up vs. rivals? Find out at IBD Stock CheckupIt was the second factor that rattled the rest of the generics industry. Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA) stock fell 6.8% to 50.22, and hit a 19-month low of 50.01. Allergan (AGN), already staggering from the cancellation of its buyout by Pfizer (PFE), hit a two-year low of 195.50 and ended the day at 201.63, down 4.1%, even though it's selling its generics business to Teva.Perrigo (PRGO), which cut its own guidance last month, fell 4.8%, to 92.42. Smaller drugmaker Akorn (AKRX), down as much as 20%, ended the day off 7.9%, at 22. Akorn, which has fallen way behind on its accounting due to internal issues, late Friday finally set dates for its Q4 and Q1 earnings releases, for May 9 and May 17, respectively.Leerink analyst Joseph Schwartz wrote in a research note that Endo's problems read through most directly to Teva, Akorn and Perrigo, and more moderately to Allergan. Essentially, whoever's done the most price-hiking on products representing more than 5% of generic sales lately is in the most trouble.Referring to industrywide data from IMS, Schwartz wrote: ""Based on our analysis, Akorn has taken 13 price increases matching the above criteria (44% of IMS generic sales), Perrigo eight (18% of generic IMS sales) and Endo took 17 (17% of generic IMS sales).""Teva, meanwhile, is due to report its own Q1 earnings and guidance on Monday morning, and Allergan is due before the open the following day.Endo itself got at least four downgrades from Wall Street analysts Friday, mostly to neutral but one to underweight. It ended the day at 16.17, a seven-year closing low.

34,PRGO,"As had been widely rumored, drugmaker Perrigo (PRGO) lost its CEO to Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) Monday and also reported preliminary Q1 earnings and guidance that missed expectations. Perrigo stock plummeted in early trading, while Valeant stock rose modestly.Valeant said Perrigo CEO Joseph Papa will take the helm as both chairman and chief executive in early May, replacing Robert Ingram in the former role and J. Michael Pearson in the latter. Anonymous sources had leaked Papa's appointment to the press late last week, although it was still unclear at the time whether Perrigo would let him out of his contract.""(Papa) has a strong shareholder orientation, a background in science and an unmatched track record of accomplishments, highlighted by his ability to lead companies through times of transition and drive excellence across commercial, manufacturing and R&D platforms,"" Ingram said in a statement. ""In addition, fostering an ethical culture and creating opportunities for professional development have always been high priorities for Joe, and we look forward to Joe's arrival at Valeant.""Valeant rose 1.4% to 36.45 in afternoon trading on the stock market today. Perrigo tumbled 15.2% to 102.93, hitting a three-year low.Just how much is Perrigo hurting, as Valeant takes its CEO? Get an idea on IBD Stock Checkup.Perrigo, meanwhile, named its president John Hendrickson as its new CEO, ""aligned with our succession planning process,"" according to Chairman Laurie Brlas. The company also said that Q1 sales were around $1.33 billion to $1.35 billion, missing analysts' consensus of $1.4 billion, according to Thomson Reuters. Earnings were $1.71 to $1.77 a share, while Wall Street had expected $1.89.Perrigo also cut more than a dollar off its full-year EPS guidance, now $8.20 to $8.60.""The majority of this change in guidance provided on Feb. 18 is the result of a reduction in pricing expectations in our Rx segment due to industry and competitive pressures in the sector,"" Perrigo said in a statement. ""The remainder of the reduction is primarily due to weaker-than-expected performance within the BCH (branded consumer health care) segment for the next three quarters and lower expectations for consolidated new product launches.""Perrigo also said that it was assessing a possible impairment charge associated with the BCH business, which was formed when Perrigo acquired Omega Pharma last year. It said it will be prepared to report the extent of the charge when it issues its official Q1 report on May 12.

"
38,PRGO,"Shares of Valeant Pharmaceuticals International (VRX) rose sharply and fellow specialty drugmaker Perrigo’s (PRGO) fell Friday on reports that the former is about to hire away the latter's CEO.Late Thursday, the Wall Street Journal quoted anonymous sources saying that Valeant is hiring Joseph Papa if it can get Perrigo's board to void a noncompete clause in his contract. On Friday morning, Perrigo issued a brief statement saying that it would not comment on ""speculation,"" which is the only official word from either company so far.Valeant has been hunting for a new CEO since March 21, when activist investor William Ackman moved to the board and tried to order the company's growing chaos. The stock lost more than 80% of its value since a scandal related to a pharmacy partner broke last September, forcing Valeant to strike a new distribution deal with Walgreen Boots Alliance (WBA) that was accompanied by across-the-board price cuts. A disastrous Q4 report and guidance cut, along with an internal investigation that accused former CFO and current board member Howard Schiller of misconduct, eventually turned even bullish analysts against Valeant's management.Papa, meanwhile, has run Perrigo for 10 years and has a largely successful track record. Under his watch, the company's revenue has more than tripled, the stock has climbed eightfold, an inversion deal moved headquarters to low-tax Dublin, and Mylan (MYL) attempted a hostile takeover that Perrigo successfully fought off.IBD Take: Perrigo was once a hot stock, but not lately. Learn why in IBD Stock CheckupPerrigo's once-steady profit growth has gotten uneven in the last couple of years, however, and the stock has declined more than 40% since its Mylan-induced high last April. It currently holds a mediocre IBD Composite Rating of 40.This change has led some analysts to worry about the implications of Papa's departure for Perrigo.""Papa has become the face of Perrigo during his long tenure as CEO,"" wrote Jefferies analyst David Steinberg in a research note. ""However, with the exception of CFO Judy Brown, the company’s other executives -- including John Hendrickson, who was appointed President in Oct. 2015 -- are largely unfamiliar to the investment community.""Further, the timing couldn’t have been more inopportune. Mr. Papa is potentially departing prior to the announcement of Q1 results, and this follows a string of difficult quarterly financials -- particularly in the company’s flagship consumer business.""Guggenheim analyst Louise Chen agreed, noting that Perrigo is widely expected to miss Q1 estimates and lower its guidance. ""There has been debate about senior management change at Perrigo, but we don't think the Street was thinking that it would actually happen or be this soon,"" Chen wrote.Perrigo stock was down 5.8% in late-afternoon trading on the stock market today, near 121, after hitting its lowest level intraday since August 2013. Valeant stock was up 7.7%, near 36.

The small cap Russell 2000 ended the week ahead 1.4% vs. a 0.5% gain for the S&P 500 and 0.7% decline for the Nasdaq.The top economic event will be the Federal Open Market Committee's rate policy decision on Wednesday afternoon. Few expect any substantive change is pending, but hints as to how and when the Fed might go about upcoming increases are plenty enough to move markets.Today, the Commerce Department reports March new home sales at 10 a.m. ET.Oil prices are once again likely to be in focus throughout the week. WTI crude oil for June delivery added 0.5% after rising gasoline demand helped drive oil up more than 8% last week. That was crude's ninth gain in the past 10 weeks and the largest climb since early March. Oil and energy industries have led much of the market's advance over the past eight weeks, and turned in eight of the top 10 gains among industries last week.A handful of heavyweight oil reports are due out during the week, beginning with BP (BP) on Tuesday and winding up to Friday's report from Exxon Mobil (XOM).Check IBD's Investing Action Plan for a broader view of the week's most important events.In early trading, Dow stocks were mostly lower but with both gains and losses holding to less than 1%.Xerox (XRX) slumped nearly 8% just after the open after reporting a slightly worse-than-expected drop in earnings.

"
44,PRGO,"Generic drugmaker Perrigo (PRGO) dipped in morning trading Thursday after its Q4 earnings missed estimates, with guidance also on the low side. Excluding one-time items, Perrigo made $1.80 a share in the quarter, down 1% from the year-earlier quarter and missing analysts' consensus by 13 cents, according to Thomson Reuters. Revenue rose 33% to $1.43 billion, about $35 million below consensus.…
"
45,PRGO,"Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) shares climbed as much as 11% Tuesday after the drug maker said it expects to restate earnings, but not by much overall. That may help clear the air after a congressional investigation raised questions about the company's former relationship with distributor Philidor Rx Services and questioned its pricing practices.Specialty drugmaker Valeant said in a written statement late Monday evening that an internal review and additional analysis ""identified certain sales to Philidor during 2014 ... that should have been recognized when product was dispensed to patients rather than on delivery to Philidor.""Valeant said that it currently believes that about $58 million of net revenue that was included in the second half of 2014 should have been booked later.Correcting the misstatements is expected to reduce reported 2014 GAAP earnings per share by about 10 cents to $8.24, Valeant said. But it would  increase its 2015 GAAP EPS by roughly 9 cents. Based on analyst consensus that would lift 2015 EPS to roughly $10.37.Valeant shares closed up 4.4% in the stock market today. Shares had fallen 19.3% on Friday and Monday after Wells Fargo warned of unanswered questions about the company's accounting and strategic direction. The stock fell after hours Monday when the Wall Street Journal said an earnings restatement was likely.Its stock plunged 74% from an Aug. 5, 2015 intraday high of 262.52 after the questionable numbers came to light, to a 69.33 low on Nov. 18.In the statement, Valeant noted that the sales occurred prior its earlier bid to acquire Philidor. Specialty pharmacy Philidor was suspected of filling prescriptions for Valeant that altered doctors' orders to raise insurer reimbursements, Bloomberg said in an Oct. 29 report, citing former employees and an internal document.On Oct. 30, Valeant said it was severing ties with Philidor, which subsequently began winding down operations.Interim Chief Executive Howard Schiller said in the statement the company also expects to delay filing its 2015 10-K until its completed ""review of related accounting matters by its ad hoc committee.""This determination and the need to delay our 10-K filing are very disappointing but necessary,"" Schiller said, adding,  ""We remain committed to improving reporting procedures, internal controls and transparency for our investors.Schiller was named to the post on an interim basis on Jan. 6, filling in for ailing CEO J. Michael Pearson, who is being treated for severe pneumonia and complications.Valeant will release unaudited Q4 results on Feb. 29.Private label over-the-counter and prescription generic drugmaker Perrigo's (PRGO) shares have been battered too, and fell to the lowest point in about 2-1/2 years Monday. Perrigo lost 15% in three sessions after reporting weak fourth quarter earnings last Thursday and being downgraded by analysts on earnings. Perrigo closed up 0.6%.Big pharma Allergan (AGN), which reported a 33% hike n Q4 EPS and a 74% jump in revenue Monday, rose 3.7% Monday, and finished up 0.3% Tuesday. Allergan agreed in November to be acquired by Pfizer (PFE) for $160 billion and that deal is expected to close this year.
"
46,PRGO,"Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) and Perrigo (PRGO) shares continued to tumble Monday, generally pulling the drug sector down with them. Allergan (AGN) was an exception, rising on strong earnings.Valeant late Monday tumbled as low as 68 -- which would be the lowest since March 2013 -- on a Dow Jones report that Valeant Pharmaceuticals would likely restate earnings. Hours later Valeant said a restatement for 2014 and 2015 earnings is expected, related to sales of drugs to ex-distributor Philidor. Valeant said $58 million in sales in late 2014 should have been recognized later. Valeant expects 2014 earnings to be lowered by 10 cents a share, with 2015 EPS lifted by 9 cents.During the regular session, Valeant shares closed down 10.7% at 75.92  in the stock market today, extending losses on a bearish report from Wells Fargo Friday. Valeant shares dived nearly 10% that day after Wells Fargo initiated coverage on the maker of branded drugs to treat eye diseases, acne, depression and other ailments with an underperform, saying there were ""unanswered questions"" about its accounting methods and strategic direction.Earlier Monday, drugstore giant CVS Health (CVS) said it plans to restrict use of Valeant's Jublia toenail fungus drug as part of an initiative to cut costs for dermatology treatments. Jublia retails at about $1,000 for an 8-milliliter bottle, according to the website GoodRx.Valeant stock price has plunged 69% from a Sept. 21 intraday high at 245.82 despite double-digit quarterly earnings and revenue growth for nearly four years. Bill Ackman's Pershing Square hedge fund is down significantly this year partly because of the fund's large stake in Valeant.Valeant had already been battered by a series of events including the absence of CEO J. Michael Pearson, who is being treated for severe pneumonia and complications. On Jan. 6, Valeant's board named board member and former Chief Financial Officer Howard Schiller A interim CEO.Earlier this month, Valeant interim CEO Schiller was called before Congress to explain why the company decided to increase the prices of two cardiac drugs by 525% and 212%. Schiller promised to end an era of sharp price hikes.Perrigo, whose business model is divided between private-label over-the-counter and prescription generic drugs, fell 4.1% to 124.08 Monday to its lowest level since late 2013.The stock has lost 15% over three sessions, after Perrigo reported weak fourth quarter results on Thursday and subsequently had negative reports by Jefferies on Friday and by Goldman Sachs on Monday.Jefferies cut its price target to 163 from 209 although it maintained a buy rating. Goldman Sachs, however, downgraded the stock from neutral to sell, with a 124 price target, reports said.Perrigo reported $1.80 Q4 EPS minus one-time items, 13 cents below estimates. It was the company's first earnings miss in five quarters. Revenue grew 33% to $1.425 billion. Analysts expected $1.461 billion.Mylan (MYL) last year made an offer for Perrigo, which Perrigo shareholders in mid-November rejected. Mylan rose 3.2% Monday.Big pharma Allergan (AGN) reported what it expects to be its final full earnings report as an independent drug maker after it agreed in November to be bought by Pfizer (PFE) for $160 billion.Allergan's Q4 EPS ex items rose 33% to $3.41 on a 74% hike in revenue to $4.2 billion. Wall Street expected $3.34 EPS and $4.19 billion revenue.Allergan shares climbed 3.7% to 285.82. Pfizer rose 1.9%.But IBD's generic drugs and ethical (branded) drug groups were among the rare losers on an otherwise strong day for stocks.

47,PRGO,"Stocks wrestled in and out of narrowly mixed territory early Thursday, as rising oil, mixed economic data and earnings news all factored into opening trade.The Dow hashed back and forth, in and out of narrow gains. The Nasdaq slipped 0.4% as Discovery Communications (DISCA), Dish Network (DISH) and Garmin (GRMN) all dragged on the index. The S&P 500 shed 0.2%.Volume moved lower, down 14% on the Nasdaq and off 9% on the NYSE, relative to trade at the same time Wednesday.  Lighter volume can signal that institutional investors are not significantly active.The stock market today felt some early push from overseas markets, with benchmark indexes in Hong Kong and Tokyo closing more than 2% higher. But Europe's markets backed away from early gains and turned mixed in afternoon trade following the start of U.S. markets.A positive reading on weekly jobless claims also aided opening action. But continued contraction in mid-Atlantic manufacturing, as gauged by the Philly Fed Index, stirred concerns over the state of the economy.The Conference Board reported its January Leading Indicators Index slipped 0.2% -- in line with expectations. It also revised December's decline upward to 0.3%.Oil prices pushed up more than 3%, lifting West Texas Intermediate to near $32 a barrel and Brent crude well above $35. American Petroleum Institute data on Wednesday showed U.S. oil inventories declined 3.3 million barrels in the week ended Feb. 12. The Energy Information Administration plans to releases its weekly inventory report at 11 a.m. ET.IBM (IBM) bucked up 5% to lead the Dow. The company announced it was buying health care software provider Truven Health Analytics for $2.6 billion.Wal-Mart (WMT) dropped almost 5%, the Dow's worst loss, after Q4 earnings narrowly beat, but fourth-quarter revenue and full-year revenue guidance missed consensus projections.Nvidia (NVDA) charged to the head of the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 indexes, spiking 10%.  Nvidia's fourth-quarter earnings and revenue, along with guidance, easily outpaced analyst expectations in a report following Wednesday's close.Generic drug maker Perrigo (PRGO) tumbled more than 9% lower. Earnings and revenue missed analyst consensus estimates, and management significantly pared the top end of its full-year EPS guidance. The stock had been correcting, rising briefly above its 10-week line since August.Among IBD 50 stocks, Universal Display (OLED) rumbled up almost 4% in strong trade – working on a seventh straight advance. The move positioned shares for a test of resistance at their 50-day moving average after retaking support at their 200-day line on Wednesday.Turf tending equipment maker Toro (TTC) bolted 4% higher in heavy action. That sent shares into buying range above a 75.22 buy point in a cup-with-handle base.At the low end of the list, Five Below (FIVE) dropped 3%, pulling back in light trade after a six-day rally. The slip put shares back below a 36.59 buy point in a cup with handle base. 
"
48,PRGO,"Perrigo shareholders rejected a hostile takeover bid by fellow generic-drug maker Mylan Friday morning, sending Perrigo stock down and Mylan up, as a long and acrimonious battle ended.
"
49,PRGO,"Mylan (MYL) said in a press release that by the 8 a.m. ET deadline, some 40% of Perrigo (PRGO) shares had been validly tendered, missing the 50% required for the $26 billion takeover to succeed.

50,PRGO,"Growing It Alone

51,PRGO,"Mylan management maintained in the statement that it would be fine without Perrigo.
"
52,PRGO,"""Mylan's focused approach to organic and inorganic growth has delivered a 27% compound annual growth rate in adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS) for shareholders since 2008, while strategically and consistently expanding our business,"" said Mylan CEO Heather Bresch. ""Our recent financial results continue to demonstrate the power of our stand-alone platform, with double-digit growth in our legacy business, as well as enhanced double-digit growth from the EPD business.""
"
53,PRGO,"Mylan shareholders seemed to agree, as its stock rose 12.9% to close at 48.78. Perrigo stock fell 6.2% to 146.90, but its management claimed victory.
"
54,PRGO,"""We have said all along that this offer from Mylan was a bad deal for our shareholders, as it significantly undervalued our durable business model and industry-leading future growth prospects,"" Perrigo CEO Joseph Papa said in a statement. ""Strong organic growth, a disciplined approach to M&A and transparent, accessible corporate governance policies are the foundation of our successful business strategy.""
"
55,PRGO,"Mylan first proposed buying Perrigo back in April for $60 in cash plus 2.2 Mylan shares for each Perrigo share, which it later lifted to $75 a share plus 2.3 Mylan shares — at the time, about $36 billion.
"
56,PRGO,"By the time Mylan launched its tender offer on Sept. 14, the stock portion of that offer had lost considerable value, a result of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA) abandoning its own hostile bid for Mylan to buy the generics business of Allergan (AGN) and also from the general drug-stock sell-off. Perrigo's stock has fallen also, however, leading Mylan to argue that Perrigo shareholders could still make money off a deal.
"
57,PRGO,"Perrigo's leadership has steadfastly opposed Mylan's overtures, criticizing the offer, Mylan's business and Mylan's corporate governance. At the same time, they've sought to mollify shareholders with operational improvements and a $2 billion share buyback plan, the latter of which Papa said Friday would go ahead now that the vote is over.
"
58,PRGO,"According to anonymously sourced reports, Perrigo's buyout prospects were also on hold until the Mylan issue was resolved. The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday that during the summer, Perrigo was in talks with Endo International (ENDP) about a possible combination.
"
59,PRGO,"M&A: Not A Done Deal
"
60,PRGO,"S&P Capital IQ analyst Jeffrey Loo wrote that he expects more M&A in Perrigo's future.
"
61,PRGO,"""We did not see many synergistic fits between the two companies, and now that the Mylan issue is over, we believe Perrigo will begin to pursue acquisitions themselves, likely within the consumer health care unit,"" Loo wrote in a research note maintaining his buy rating on both Perrigo and Mylan.
"
62,PRGO,"Morningstar analyst Michael Waterhouse also wrote that he sees Mylan staying on the hunt.
"
63,PRGO,"""The generic drug industry still remains relatively fragmented, in our view, and possible asset sales from Pfizer (PFE) or Sanofi (SNY) could provide Mylan with other opportunities for mergers and acquisitions, especially with assets that may have greater cost synergy potential than Perrigo's mostly over-the-counter business,"" Waterhouse wrote in his research note.Perrigo shareholders rejected a hostile takeover bid by fellow generic-drug maker Mylan Friday morning, sending Perrigo stock down and Mylan up, as a long and acrimonious battle ended.Mylan (MYL) said in a press release that by the 8 a.m. ET deadline, some 40% of Perrigo (PRGO) shares had been validly tendered, missing the 50% required for the $26 billion takeover to succeed.Growing It AloneMylan management maintained in the statement that it would be fine without Perrigo.""Mylan's focused approach to organic and inorganic growth has delivered a 27% compound annual growth rate in adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS) for shareholders since 2008, while strategically and consistently expanding our business,"" said Mylan CEO Heather Bresch.

105,PRGO,"Shareholders of generic-drug giant Mylan (MYL) on Friday voted in favor of continuing the firm's hostile bid for Perrigo (PRGO), launching what could be a protracted battle. Mylan said two-thirds of shareholders had approved both the transaction and the issuance of shares to Perrigo shareholders for the cash-and-stock bid, which as of Mylan's last formal proposal in April was worth…
"
106,PRGO,"To be sold or not to be sold? That is, of course, the question that lies before generic-drug maker Perrigo (PRGO). But regardless of the answer, analysts say there is plenty of reason for investors to take interest in the Dublin-based company, owing to its ability to capitalize on trends in generic prescription drugs and over-the-counter sales.First things first: On Friday, stockholders of drugmaker Mylan (MYL) are scheduled to vote on whether to approve a $30-billion-plus hostile takeover bid for Perrigo and move ahead with a tender offer. Perrigo CEO Joseph Papa, speaking this month with analysts during the company's latest quarterly earnings call, reiterated his own opposition to the offer and the unanimous rejection by Perrigo's board.""I make no prediction on how the Mylan shareholders will vote, but I want to remind everyone, including the Mylan shareholders, that if they proceed with a tender offer for Perrigo, this will not be the easy path that some are painting it to be,"" Papa said, expressing confidence that Perrigo investors support his stand-alone ambitions.Mylan began pursuing Perrigo earlier this year. Following several refusals, Mylan recently offered $75 a share in cash and 2.3 of its shares for each Perrigo share. Mylan needs both the approval of its own shareholders and support from 50% of Perrigo's investors, plus one more share to seal a deal.If Mylan Insists, A New DecisionIn letters to shareholders, public statements and his most recent earnings call, Papa has said that Mylan has undervalued Perrigo. ""If Mylan does win their shareholder vote and initiate a tender process, we'll make a strategic decision with the board about what's the right thing to do for the company,"" he said.Expecting a close vote, analysts and observers say that, whether a deal ever gets done or not, the M&A talk surrounding Perrigo has attracted some positive attention. ""We are sticking with our buy rating on Perrigo as we see paths to upside in the shares either on a stand-alone basis (hopefully supplemented by acquisitions) or in a large-scale M&A context (e.g., sale to Mylan or another party),"" Deutsche Bank analysts wrote.Perhaps deal talks will lead to an even stronger bid from Mylan or another suitor — a potential win for investors. Sam Pappas, CEO of Mystic Asset Management and a veteran health care industry investor, told IBD that many pharma companies are hunting acquisitions, so it would not surprise him if more buyers show serious interest in Perrigo. ""It's about building up the pipelines,"" he said. ""And M&A can be an efficient way to do that.""On the other hand, if Mylan's takeover attempt falters and other suitors do not immediately enter the fray, Perrigo would be freed from a months-long distraction and could focus anew on both organic growth and acquisitions of its own.Lawrence White, an economist at New York University's Stern School of Business and a long-time observer of M&A markets, told IBD that in the pharma industry, bigger players often can capitalize on their scale to more efficiently distribute the medications manufactured by a takeout target.But that is not always the case, he added, saying that some fast-growth companies have such robust pipelines and proven growth that a sale may simply interfere with already solid expansion paths. If Perrigo can establish that it is indeed the case, and if its own shareholders back it via a vote against a Mylan takeover, it could add an important dose of confidence for investors to feed upon.Biggest Isn't Always Best""There are a lot of moving parts to address when it comes to distributing pharmaceuticals, and that tends to favor the larger companies,"" White said. ""But it is not like there is a 'biggest is always best' rule here.""Analysts say that Perrigo is indeed well-positioned for growth should it remain a stand-alone entity. The company is a leading maker and distributor of private-label over-the-counter and generic prescription drugs, and analysts say that frugal consumers are increasingly moving away from national brands to store brands and away from expensive prescriptions to OTC alternatives. ""M&A outcomes aside, we continue to like the fundamental Perrigo story, given its global leadership position in store-brand OTC and ability to capitalize on (the) Rx-to-OTC switch,"" William Blair analysts said in an August report.Perrigo, which spent 2014 absorbing its own acquisition of Dublin-based Elan, sells treatments for everything from smoking cessation to pain relief. Its stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 96 in IBD's Medical-General Drugs industry group, which itself ranks 31st out of 197 industry groups. Perrigo is ranked No. 2 behind Allergan (AGN).For the quarter that ended in June, Perrigo reported earnings of $56.4 million, or 38 cents a share. Excluding one-time items, it generated EPS of $2.18, up 25%, on revenue up 34% to $1.53 billion. The firm cited strength in its new branded consumer health care line, which includes its recent acquisition of Omega Pharma, and expansion of pharmaceuticals revenue. Branded consumer health care generated sales of $401 million, while sales in Perrigo's prescription-pharmaceuticals segment increased 10% to $278 million.More Bolt-Ons ExpectedThe company also recently inked deals to buy Patheon's operations in Mexico, as well as a portfolio of OTC drugs from GlaxoSmithKline (GSK). Analysts anticipate that Perrigo will pursue more such bolt-on deals should it remain a stand-alone operation.After posting the quarterly results earlier in August, Perrigo executives projected 2015 EPS of $7.50 to $8, a 24% increase at the midpoint, on sales of $5.4 billion to $5.7 billion, ahead 33% at the midpoint.Executives say that, in addition to company-specific trends, Perrigo also stands to benefit from general and ongoing demographic and health care developments.""Given the megatrends that I have talked about for many years, including an aging population, increased use of medication as individuals get older and rising health care costs, Perrigo is well-positioned to meet the future needs for the global health care community,"" Papa, the chief executive, said on the earnings call.

147,PRGO,"Follow Amy Reeves on Twitter: @IBD_Areeves.Israeli drug giant Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA) reported positive results for a recently acquired drug Tuesday. Teva stock was down a fraction, however, as the company also faced a new roadblock in its effort to take over Mylan (MYL).Teva said that SD-809, a drug that it had gained in its $3.5 billion buyout of Auspex Pharmaceuticals last month, hit the primary endpoint in a pivotal trial of tardive dyskinesia, a movement disorder that sometimes afflicts people taking anti-psychotic medications. The news follows another successful trial of SD-809 against Huntington's disease, but Teva says that tardive dyskinesia is a larger market, potentially passing $1 billion a year in peak sales.""Importantly, the study also showed a favorable safety and tolerability profile, including low rates of depression, somnolence, insomnia and akathisia (a movement disorder), which are differentiating factors in the competitive landscape,"" Maxim Group analyst Jason Kolbert wrote in a research note Tuesday.Evercore ISI analyst Umer Raffat noted that the efficacy seems broadly similar to Neurocrine Biosciences' (NBIX) candidate NBI-98854 but agreed in an email, ""Safety & tolerability continues to look excellent for TEVA drug . ... This will be a very important commercial differentiator.""Also Tuesday, Abbott Laboratories (ABT), which owns a 14.5% stake in Mylan, said that it will vote to support Mylan's attempt to acquire Perrigo (PRGO), which Mylan has been pursuing since April. Supporting this acquisition could be a problem for Teva's pursuit of Mylan; Teva offered $40 billion for the company in late April while at the same time making clear that it's not interested in Perrigo's business.Though neither Perrigo nor Mylan wants to be bought, investors may not care what the companies want.

Anonymous sources said Teva may or may not make an offer but is evaluating the idea and has approached advisers on the subject, Bloomberg reported. Most of Wall Street has been assuming that Teva was thinking about this…
"
257,PRGO,"Israeli drug giant Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA) made its long-awaited bid for competitor Mylan on Tuesday, offering $82 a share, or $40.1 billion. Both stocks rose on the news.
"
258,PRGO,"Teva's proposal, half cash and half stock, was unsolicited by Mylan (MYL), which adopted a poison-pill provision this month after initial reports of Teva's interest emerged.
"
259,PRGO,"On April 8, Mylan made its own unsolicited bid for fellow generic-drug maker Perrigo (PRGO) to the tune of $29 billion, which some observers said was done at least partly to fend off a Teva bid.
"
260,PRGO,"Mylan reiterated its stance last Friday when fresh rumors of Teva's interest emerged, saying not only that the combination doesn't make strategic sense but that it would run into antitrust issues due to product overlap.
"
261,PRGO,"Evercore ISI analyst Umer Raffat said in a webinar Tuesday morning that his team's analysis estimated that Teva would have to divest about $1.2 billion worth of products to satisfy the Federal Trade Commission's requirements. Still, that's only about 5% of total annual revenue for the combined companies. A Teva spokesman had told him that their number is a bit lower, Raffat said.
"
262,PRGO,"Among the products divested would be Mylan's generic version of Teva's blockbuster multiple-sclerosis drug Copaxone. Just last week, the FDA approved the first generic Copaxone made by the team of Momenta Pharmaceuticals (MNTA) and Novartis' (NVS) generics unit Sandoz. Mylan has its own version which is expected to also be approved sometime soon.

286,PRGO,"Generic-drug giant Mylan (MYL) announced Wednesday that it had bid $205 a share in cash and stock for sizable peer Perrigo, sending both stock soaring.
"
287,PRGO,"Although Perrigo (PRGO) apparently hadn't agreed to a deal, Mylan's statement indicated they'd been talking.
"
288,PRGO,"""This proposal is the culmination of a number of prior discussions between Mylan and Perrigo about the compelling strategic and financial logic of this combination,"" Mylan CEO Robert Coury said in a press release. ""This combination would result in meaningful immediate and long-term value creation, and our proposal is designed to deliver that value to shareholders and other stakeholders of both companies.""
"
289,PRGO,"Mylan noted that the two companies' combined 2014 revenue was $15.3 billion, and said a combination would increase earnings and operating profit margins. The total value of the offer was nearly $29 billion at the time of the late-morning announcement, and the equity component was set to increase as Mylan's stock was up more than 15% in midday trading on the stock market today to a new high near 69. Perrigo's stock also hit a new high, cruising nearly 30% past 212, though it was up less than 22%, near 210.50, in midday trading.
"
290,PRGO,"Wall Street analysts had been speculating that Mylan would be involved in some major M&A, but the most popular idea had been a combination with Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA). In fact, just hours before the news broke, JPMorgan analyst Chris Schott theorized in a research note that Mylan could go for upward of $80 a share in such a deal. However, he added that ""we believe Mylan could look at its own larger M&A transactions.""
"
291,PRGO,"Mylan is one of the highest-rated stocks among large drugmakers, sporting an IBD Composite Rating of 97. Perrigo was formerly a top-rating stock but its profit growth has recently flattened out, leaving a CR of 82.

379,PRGO,"Generic-drug maker Lannett Co. boasts a robust pipeline and has its sights on growing revenue substantially over the next several years.The Philadelphia-based company is already on solid footing. In late August, it reported fiscal 2014 fourth-quarter earnings of 64 cents per share, up more than 400% from a year earlier on sales that doubled to $80.6 million. Lannett (LCI), which develops and manufactures medications to treat an array of maladies, cited particular strength in sales for its largest product categories: thyroid deficiency, cardiovascular and pain management.Ahead of its fiscal 2015 first quarter report due out on Nov. 3, the company on Oct. 23 preannounced that it expects to report net sales of approximately $93 million for the quarter — more than double a year earlier — and diluted earnings per share between 91 cents and 94 cents. Lannett, which has been able to raise prices in its key product categories during a window of tempered competition in its fiscal 2014, said its margins are improving substantially.This helps to explain why Lannett stock has rebounded from a rough patch in July, when the company received a subpoena from the Connecticut attorney general about a price-fixing investigation of its heart medicine digoxin, and is now up more than 50% since the start of August.Getting Past A Price ProbeThe company said in September that a review conducted by outside legal experts found that it did not violate Connecticut law, and analysts say investors have since turned their attention back to the company's favorable sales and earnings trajectories.""I don't think they did anything wrong, and management has reiterated the same,"" Oppenheimer & Co. analyst Rohit Vanjani told IBD. ""So I think the pricing is pretty solid.""Needham & Co. analyst Elliot Wilbur said in an interview that the operating environment for Lannett ""looks quite favorable.""He said consolidation in the prescription-drug industry has minimized competition in an era when demand for medication from an aging population continues to grow, providing companies such as Lannett leverage to legally boost prices. At the same time, he added, substantial new competition at Lannett's size in the generic space has yet to materialize.Highly rated Lannett is a smaller firm in IBD's Medical-Generic Drugs industry group, which is dominated in size by Actavis (ACT), Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) and Perrigo (PRGO). The group is a strong performer, ranked No. 3 among 197 groups tracked by IBD. Lannett holds a best-possible Composite Rating of 99, as do fellow group members Actavis and Akorn (AKRX).Lannett spokesman Robert Jaffe said the company has entered a customary quiet period ahead of its November earnings release and executives could not comment for this article. But, while speaking at a conference in September, the company's CEO said Lannett has been able to raise prices on about 75% of its products, and he said the favorable pricing environment could extend into 2016.""We are an opportunistic company,"" CEO Arthur Bedrosian said. ""We see opportunities to raise prices. Competitors drop out of products. There are shortages in the marketplace that sometimes drive it.""CFO Marty Galvan, speaking at the same conference, said that Lannett in total has 68 products in its pipeline, including 23 that are currently under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. He said the company, which generated nearly $274 million of revenue in its fiscal 2014, could top $450 million by fiscal 2018.Galvan said of the 68 products in Lannett's current pipeline, it views 45 as having ""the highest probability of success from an FDA and commercial perspective."" On average, he said, each drug could produce about $4 million in annual revenue. ""So that's about $180 million of growth that we see coming from our pipeline"" and ""on the market by fiscal 2018.""New Niche ExploredThe company's pipeline is swelling as it expands into the controlled drug arena, which executives view as ripe for growth.Lannett is among only seven companies that hold the DEA license required to import the raw materials needed to produce controlled substances for pain management. It also is among only a few companies that have the ability to then manufacture both the ingredients needed for these medications as well as the final dosages.At the same time, because of the aging U.S. population, Lannett expects demand for controlled pain medications to mount in coming years. So because of limited competition in this space and increasing demand, it views this as a reliable segment for favorable profit margins.Most recently, in September, Lannett won FDA approval of its oxycodone hydrochloride oral solution for pain management. It marked the fourth Lannett product approved by the FDA in 2014.The shift to controlled drugs is important, analysts say, because while Lannett is currently having success boosting prices broadly, it won't be able to do so indefinitely. ""It won't last forever. It never does,"" said Wilbur, the Needham analyst. ""Competition will inevitably come back in.""CEO Bedrosian shares that view. He said at the conference that, by the end of 2016, he anticipates competition to re-emerge.""In our industry, that is generally done with lowering your price and trying to grab customers away from the competitor,"" he said. ""That's one of the reasons why we migrated towards controlled drugs.""The eventual return of competition also helps explain why Lannett is looking for acquisitions to help drive revenue even further in the meantime. Though the industry has already consolidated notably in recent years and removed many potential take-out targets, ""there's still significant value-creation potential for them on the acquisition front,"" Wilbur said.We ""certainly look to acquire smaller companies than us,"" Bedrosian said. ""It's almost like what goes on in the animal kingdom: The larger ones gobbling up the smaller ones. We are hopefully doing some gobbling ourselves.""He said the company had recently pursued two targets without success but continues to prowl for more opportunities. ""We are hoping by acquiring them, we can kind of stave off the eventuality of us being acquired,"" Bedrosian said. ""Or when it happens, we've got an offer that our shareholders are going to figure is the best offer we could have received and happy to assign their shares to the acquirer.""That latter possibility, of Lannett eventually selling, appears to be years away, as Bedrosian emphasized that the company is ""not on the market. We are growing rapidly on our own."" But it nevertheless adds long-term appeal to the stock, analysts say.Wilbur said that if Lannett can acquire multiple smaller competitors over the next few years as it builds toward its 2018 targets, it could reach the $1 billion mark in terms of annual sales. If it nears that level, he said, it would become ""increasingly"" appealing to an array of much larger pharmaceutical companies, including foreign operations looking to get a foothold in the U.S.Wilbur said a $1 billion drug firm could sell for as much as $4 billion.While not in the company's current plans, Bedrosian said, ""I do see eventually someone acquiring a company like Lannett. Because they want to get into the controlled drugs space would be one reason they would make an offer to acquire us. And we would get a favorable premium, because we are in that space and we have made the commitment to grow in that area.""

A raft of payroll and jobs data are due out later in the week and strategy decisions are also expected from central banks in Europe.The news may just be enough to bump the Nasdaq and S&P 500 out of their recent stupor. Both have stalled in mumbling trade for the past two weeks, while the Dow has edged slightly higher.In mergers and acquisition news, shares of Ireland-based Elan (ELN) popped 8% after drug maker Perrigo (PRGO) said it would buy the company for $8.6 billion. Reuters reported that the deal, through Ireland's tax policies, will cut Perrigo's overall tax rate to the high teens from about 30%. It also gives Perrigo royalty rights to Elan's blockbuster multiple sclerosis drug Tysbari, which had sales of $1.6 billion last year.Perrigo rose a fraction.Two global leaders in the advertising trade, New York-based Omnicom (OMC) and France's Publicis Groupe, said Sunday they would merge on a deal valued at $35.1 billion.

Wynn has been correcting since late May, and battling to retake support at its 10-week line for the past two weeks.On the IBD 50 list, Herbalife gained 2% ahead of the opening bell, ahead of its after hour earnings report.

"
567,PRGO,"Irish drugmaker Elan's (ELN) lengthy drama came to a close early Monday as it announced it had agreed to a $6.7 billion takeover by Michigan-based Perrigo (PRGO).
"
568,PRGO,"Perrigo agreed to pay $16.50 a share for Elan, which amounts to $8.6 billion, but it will get $1.9 billion in cash Elan's been gathering through divestments of its assets. Most recently in April, Elan landed a cool $3.25 billion for its ownership share of Tysabri, the blockbuster multiple-sclerosis drug it had been splitting 50/50 with Biogen Idec (BIIB). Biogen will still pay a royalty on sales of the drug, with the percentage increasing if and when sales pass $2 billion.
"
569,PRGO,"Tysabri was the only marketed drug Elan had left after it sold off most of its other assets in previous transactions. It has one product in the pipeline, designed to treat aggression in patients with Alzheimer's disease. But after the failure of its potentially much bigger Alzheimer's treatment bapineuzumab, which it was co-developing with Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Pfizer (PFE), the company basically became a royalty engine.
"
570,PRGO,"Elan CEO Kelly Martin said he had big plans for the company, but last month he faced a shareholder revolt. At an extraordinary meeting, stockholders turned down a deal to pay $1 billion for a portion of Theravance's (THRX) royalties from a set of pulmonary drugs it was developing with GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), and also pressured management into putting Elan up for sale after they'd fended off a hostile takeover attempt from Royalty Pharma. Martin had to abandon his plans but proved correct in saying Elan could get a better price than Royalty's offer of $13 a share.
"
571,PRGO,"Perrigo, though, is an odd match for Elan. Its main business is in generic over-the-counter drugs, which are sold under the house brands of various drugstores, and it has no products comparable to Elan's neurological drugs. In fact, the early consensus on the Street seemed to be that Perrigo was mainly in it for the chance to relocate to Ireland for the tax benefits.
"
572,PRGO,"""This acquisition follows a familiar strategy used by other specialty pharmaceutical companies, including Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) and Actavis (ACT), to lower tax liabilities through tax restructuring deals,"" wrote Morningstar analyst Michael Waterhouse in a research note Monday. ""We expect Perrigo may eventually divest the royalty streams it will receive from Elan ... . As a generic pharmaceutical manufacturer, we doubt Perrigo will utilize Elan's assets as a launching pad for future biotech drug development.""
"
573,PRGO,"On a conference call with analysts, company executives estimated Perrigo's tax rate will fall to the high teens from near 30% now.
"
574,PRGO,"Perrigo CEO Joseph Papa also said the deal created ""meaningful synergy opportunities"" and would be accretive to his company's 2014 earnings. But he brushed off a question about whether it made sense to hang onto Tysabri.
"
575,PRGO,"""We're excited about the Tysabri asset,"" he said. ""I think we clearly always will continue to look at maximizing shareholder value, but for right now, we think it's a great asset and one that we think is important to us for the future.""
"
576,PRGO,"Nonetheless, he added, ""I don't want anyone to think that we're going to start spending billions of dollars in R&D,"" and said the company would decide about how to deal with the one Elan product in the pipeline, ELND-005, after its next clinical-trial milestone.
"
577,PRGO,"RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee estimates Elan's royalties will contribute $300 million to $400 million annually to Perrigo's revenue, which over the last 12 months totaled $3.4 billion. Nonetheless, some investors may have felt Perrigo overpaid, as its stock dropped 6.7% Monday to close at 125.18, after hitting an all-time high of 134.31 on Friday.
"
578,PRGO,"""We view the deal favorably long term as an opportunity to enhance international expansion platform via Irish domicile, but at 23 times EV/EBITDA (on 2015 estimates), the acquisition looks expensive,"" wrote Leerink Swann analyst Jason Gerberry in a research note Monday. The ratio of enterprise value to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization is a popular measure to value a company.

Prescription drugs grew sharply, mostly due to the July acquisition of Paddock Laboratories. The other two divisions, nutritionals and active pharmaceutical ingredients, shrank due to increased competition and pricing pressure.

In an uptrending market, leading stocks often provide a second chance by briefly dropping to their 10-week moving averages, and then rebounding.Another Weekly Review name, Mellanox Technologies (MLNX), appears to be displaying that type of action. The Israeli tech stock sold off last week on news that its longtime CFO plans to retire.It's now trying to lift off support near its 10-week line, although so far volume hasn't come in as strongly as it did with last week's retreat. Mellanox has earned strong IBD Ratings across nearly all categories, except lately its Accumulation-Distribution Rating has slipped to C, reflecting the recent sell-off.There are still some leading stocks that are in buy zones. Consider Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS), which has been reaching new all-time highs.The sporting goods retailer has topped a 52.10 buy point from a five-week flat base that's part of a larger base-on-base pattern. The stock is trading less than 5% beyond 52.10, so it's still in a possible buy zone.Dick's strengths include big gains in EPS in the past two quarters, but revenue growth has been modest. Another Weekly Review stock from Dick's Retail-Leisure Products industry group is Cabela's (CAB), which is well-extended.

732,PRGO,"Quite a few stocks with respectable IBD ratings touched new highs Tuesday, as the broad market recovered from Monday's downside reversal.

Volume was tracking higher across the board.Perrigo (PRGO) dropped 3% and erased Wednesday's advance. The stock reset its base count earlier this month and is nearly five weeks into a new base. Perrigo is about 4% off its 52-week high, but its Relative Strength line is already at a new high.Hansen Natural (HANS) fell 2% in fast trading. The stock remains 3% past an 82.10 buy point from a lopsided cup-with-handle base it cleared Tuesday. Hansen's base was a third-stage structure.AutoZone (AZO) reversed from a fresh record high and lost 2% in fast trade. It fell below a 302.10 buy point it cleared Wednesday, although the breakout came in lighter-than-ideal volume.On the upside, Dollar Tree (DLTR) added 2% and was on pace for its fourth straight gain.

The company expects revenue to be flat or up by mid-single digits on a sequential basis. Currently estimates call for sales of $187.2 million, up 2% from the second quarter.After the close, restaurant giant Yum Brands (YUM) will unveil its Q2 results.

"
756,PRGO,"Within a year of patent expiration, prices crash and drugmakers can lose as much as 70% of market share to generic rivals. That's a chilling prospect for Pfizer (PFE), whose cholesterol-fighter Lipitor, the world's best-selling drug — goes off patent later this year.
"
757,PRGO,"But Pfizer and other holders of expiring blockbuster patents do have one hope. They can ask the FDA for approval to sell their drugs over the counter (OTC).
"
758,PRGO,"Prices will be much lower and they will still face generic rivals selling scripted and store-brand copies. But it's better than nothing. With prescription to OTC switching, drugmakers win ac cess to more customers. The FDA can grant up to 3 years of OTC exclusivity. And it may discourage some generic prescription rivals.
"
759,PRGO,"Regulators' concerns over safety and oversight might block drugmakers' OTC ambitions. But expect a flood of applications to put now-prescription drugs onto pharmacy shelves.
"
760,PRGO,"""We believe over the next five years that products representing $18.7 billion in branded prescription sales will move over the counter,"" said Joseph Papa, CEO of Perrigo (PRGO), a leader in store brand OTC drugs.
"
761,PRGO,"Over-the-counter drugs don't ring up the multibillion-dollar sales of patented hits like Lipitor. But several boast annual sales of $250 million to $400 million, notes Laura Mahecha, industry manager for the health care practice at Kline & Co. OTC winners include allergy drugs Claritin and Zyrtec, as well as heartburn treatments Prevacid and Prilo-sec.
"
762,PRGO,"Over Counter, Under Table?
"
763,PRGO,"Still, the OTC option isn't always so simple.
"
764,PRGO,"Drugmakers don't like to talk about switch applications, and Pfizer did not respond to an interview request from IBD. But industry watchers believe it has been trying unsuccessfully for years to gain OTC approval for Lipitor and Viagra. Pfizer is also seeking to extend its impotence drug's patent from 2012 to 2019.
"
765,PRGO,"""I don't think there's any question they've been pushing for switches for several years,"" said Steve Francesco, a consultant specializing in OTC switches who heads the eponymous Francesco International.
"
766,PRGO,"The FDA typically raises questions about the wisdom of OTC sale of scripted drugs. Pfizer and the FDA have likely been going ""back and forth"" on the safety of OTC Lipitor and Viagra, he says.
"
767,PRGO,"""You've got to make sure that the population that uses it, uses it properly,"" he said. Dosing, for example, could be an issue with Viagra. ""If one is good, six might be better,"" some drugstore cowboys could reason, according to Francesco. High cholesterol requires periodic testing. Who will do that if a doctor is not involved?
"
768,PRGO,"But between prescriptions and full counter access there is a third way.
"
769,PRGO,"Expiring patent holders could seek ""behind the counter"" status. Consumers would need pharmacist approval for such nonprescription medications. More common in Europe, a well-known example here is Plan B. The drug, used by women who fear contraception efforts have failed, is available only behind the counter.
"
770,PRGO,"""By 2016, there will be a dramatic growth in these Rx to behind-the-counter switches,"" Francesco added. Top candidates include cholesterol, incontinence and insomnia treatments.
"
771,PRGO,"Currently, just a few smaller insurers reimburse for OTC drugs. But Francesco expects ""greater reimbursement over time.""
"
772,PRGO,"Eventually, OTC brands face generic imitation via store brands made for the likes of CVS (CVS), Wal-Mart (WMT) and Walgreen (WAG).
"
773,PRGO,"Store brands hold 30% of the OTC market — and growing.
"
774,PRGO,"""We believe store brands could ultimately get over 40% share,"" said Perrigo CEO Papa.
"
775,PRGO,"But even with store-brand rivals, ""pricing pressure is not as great in OTC,"" noted SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst Frank Pinkerton.Within a year of patent expiration, prices crash and drugmakers can lose as much as 70% of market share to generic rivals.

The Nasdaq rose 1%, the NYSE composite 0.8% and the S&P 500 0.7%. The IBD 50 edged up 0.1%, however, as losses in Perrigo (PRGO) and NetEase (NTES) weighed on the index.

870,PRGO,"The stock market can be shaky, terrible, so-so, great or whatever, and no matter what it is, some people will continue to get sick. As a result, drug stocks can be a bit of a defensive play in a poor market.
"
871,PRGO,"Drug and biomed companies indeed have figured fairly prominently in the IBD 50 rankings of top stocks of late, during a volatile time for the market.
"
872,PRGO,"In fact, medical-related stocks count for fully 20% of the IBD 50 for the week of Oct. 10.
"
873,PRGO,"But let's look at just the top 5 drug stocks, led by a couple of companies that have ranked high for a couple months. The below are listed by IBD 50 rank:
"
874,PRGO,"1. Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN). The stock has held up well on expectations of more approved uses for its only drug on the market, Soliris. For now, Soliris is the only drug on the market approved to treat a rare blood disorder called paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. PNH is life-threatening, and the drug can cost a patient $400,000 for full treatment. On Sept. 26, as we reported, The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Soliris' use to treat a disease called atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, or aHUS. And the European Committee for Medical Products for Human Use, or CHMP, recommended that the same indication be extended to Soliris in Europe. Alexion expects final EU approval in about two months. The stock hit a new all-time high the next day, at 68.50, and closed Friday at 65.18. The stock hit a 59.17 buy point on the last day of August, so it's about 10% extended. Its latest earnings report is due Thursday, Oct. 20, before the open.
"
875,PRGO,"5. Perrigo (PRGO). While Alexion is in our Medical Biotech-Biomed Group, which ranks No. 17 of 197 groups tracked by IBD, Perrigo is in the Medical Generic Drugs group, at No. 22. Perrigo has led the 15-stock group for months. On Aug. 30, it hit a 94.71 buy point, but has been up-and-down since. It closed Friday at 95.31. It sells store-brand generic drugs at chains such as CVS (CVS) and Target (TGT). Next year, it expects to release generics of such over-the-counter drugs as Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) Prevacid and Mucinex. Last week, Deutsche Bank initiated coverage of Perrigo, but with only a hold rating.
"
876,PRGO,"21. Celgene (CELG). The maker of cancer drugs recently got good news about Revlimid, its successor to thalidomide. As we reported, a European regulatory panel put to rest concerns about any risks of the drug causing secondary cancers. This is a step toward some possible big approvals for the drug next year. Celgene has made thalidomide the drug of choice for treating the blood cancer multiple myeloma, despite the terrible reputation that drug gained in the 1960s, when its use as a morning-sickness treatment led to a rash of birth defects. Last year, the company greatly expanded its cancer drug efforts, with its $3 billion acquisition of Abraxis BioScience. As we reported at that time, analysts said that deal means Celgene is building a ""franchise"" in cancer drugs. The stock hit a 62.59 buy point last month and closed Friday at 62.95.
"
877,PRGO,"24. Watson Pharmaceuticals (WPI). The maker of generic drugs ranging from painkillers to blood pressure medicine to smoking cessation products has, like Perrigo, generally done well in the economic downturn, as people turn to lower-cost drugs. The stock's been on a more-or-less steady roll since the start of 2009. On Friday, the company confirmed that it's challenging the patents on Pfizer's (PFE) Embeda. Watson says it's asked the FDA to approve a low-cost generic version of Embeda, an extended-release drug that treats moderate to severe pain. Watson said Pfizer is suing it for patent infringement. That suit means the FDA can't approve the Watson drug for at least 30 months, or until the suit is settled. The stock fell 1.05% on Friday on the news.
"
878,PRGO,"25. Shire (SHPGY). The company is a member of IBD's Medical Ethical Drugs group, a 45-company group that ranks No. 8. Ireland-based Shire has been a leader of the group, hitting an all-time high of 105.53 on July 28. It's fallen about 10% since, but that means it's held up fairly well in a rough 10-week period. It's holding very near its 10-week line now, but fell below that key level for much of the past month. It specializes in treatments for rare diseases such as angiodema, a hereditary condition that causes swelling throughout the body and can be life-threatening. Its top seller is Vyvanse, for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD.

881,PRGO,"Stocks took a drubbing Wednesday, hit by the double whammy of the post-election blues and bad news in Europe. 
"
882,PRGO,"The Nasdaq swooned 2.5%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average each tumbled 2.4%. The indexes had lost as much as 2.8% at the low of the day. Volume soared on both major exchanges.
"
883,PRGO,"By diving into new lows for this correction, the market lost what had been an attempted rally. Worries over the looming fiscal cliff and warnings about the EU's economy took their toll.
"
884,PRGO,"Overnight trading in the December S&P 500 contract, which trades at about a 3.89-point discount to the spot index, shows where things went wrong. The contract peaked at 1431.75 at 2:30 a.m. ET, or 10:30 a.m. in London. That would put the spot index at 1436.64, or 0.6% above the close of Tuesday's regular session. That moderate gain was roughly in line with advances scored by benchmarks in Tokyo, Hong Kong and Sydney.
"
885,PRGO,"The futures contract started backing off, but the rout didn't begin until noon in London, or 7 a.m. ET. The contract's steep losses didn't bottom out until an hour before the U.S. markets opened. The December contract sank as low as 1384.00, which reflects a spot value of 1387.89 — a hair below the low seen in Wednesday's regular session.
"
886,PRGO,"Agrium (AGU) dived 11% after badly missing views earlier this morning. The gap-down move drew monster volume and cost the stock its 10-week line. The fertilizer maker's earnings dropped 18% to $1.34 a share, or 48 cents below views. Sales fell 6% to just over $2.96 billion vs. views of $3.13 billion. Agrium also guided Q4 profit well below analysts' expectations.
"
887,PRGO,"Vitamin Shoppe (VSI) fell 3% as it pulled back from Tuesday's 16% earnings-inspired pop. The retreat puts the stock below a 60.16 buy point from a flat base within a larger consolidation.
"
888,PRGO,"Perrigo (PRGO) shaved a large chunk of losses, but was still off by 5% in blistering trade. Before the open, the drugmaker posted disappointing fiscal Q1 sales. Perrigo reported revenue of $769.8 million, up 6% from a year ago — the first single-digit percentage gain in 10 quarters. It missed by more than $55 million.
"
889,PRGO,"On the upside, Nationstar Mortgage (NSM) ended its four-day losing streak by rising a few pennies in heavy trade. The small gain was dramatic, coming after the stock had dropped as much as 7% before clawing back. On Tuesday, the mortgage servicer reported Q3 earnings that missed views by a penny.
"
890,PRGO,"Middleby (MIDD) reversed higher and rose 3% after bouncing off support at its 50-day line. Late Tuesday, the maker of commercial cooking equipment beat expectations with Q3 earnings that grew 23% to $1.60 a share. Sales rose 18% to $257.70 million, edging views for $257.38 million. The upside reversal also put the thinly traded stock back above a 122.67 buy point from a flat base.

911,PRGO,"You might not think a country with a one-child-only policy would be a booming market for infant formula, but China has become one of the hottest markets for U.S. suppliers, who are responding by stepping up production and prices.
"
912,PRGO,"Abbott Laboratories (ABT) said Aug. 16 that it's investing $230 million to build a new powdered-milk plant in Jiaxing, which it calls its largest investment in China to date. Abbott spokesman Pete Paradossi says even with the one-child policy, some 17 million babies are born in the Middle Kingdom every year. And they capture and consume more attention and resources than ever before.
"
913,PRGO,"""That growing middle class is really demanding higher-quality products and can afford the premium-priced products as well,"" Paradossi told IBD. ""With one child, you've got two parents, you've got two (sets of) grandparents, and many times you've got great-grandparents all wanting to do what's best for that child.""
"
914,PRGO,"Another U.S. player jockeying for position is Perrigo (PRGO). Like Abbott, Perrigo is better known as a drugmaker, mostly of private-label over-the-counter medicines. But last year it moved into the infant-nutrition business with its $808 million buyout of PBM Holdings.
"
915,PRGO,"'Made In U.S.A.' Label Sells
"
916,PRGO,"On the same day that Abbott announced its new plant, Perrigo CEO Joe Papa told investors in a conference call that Asia represented a ""major opportunity"" in infant formula, especially for U.S. companies.
"
917,PRGO,"""We believe we've got a quality product,"" Perrigo said. ""That is very important to people in Asia because it's made in U.S.A., and we believe that made in U.S.A. is an important quality advantage vs. some of the concerns that have occurred in Asia with another infant formula.""
"
918,PRGO,"Papa's comment hints at the darker reason U.S. companies are doing well: the scandal that erupted in late 2008 when melamine was discovered in Chinese powdered milk supplies. More than 800 infants wound up hospitalized, and six of them died. In July 2010, more contaminated powder was seized in Qinghai.
"
919,PRGO,"Paradossi says China is ""beginning to move in the right direction"" in quality standards, but says local suppliers still have a serious trust problem. He points out that 100% of the milk Abbott uses in its Chinese formulas is imported.

920,PRGO,"The melamine scandal hasn't prodded Chinese parents to give up on infant formula. According to Euromonitor, the market grew at a compound annual rate of 28.5% from 2005 through 2010, to $3.78 billion last year. Morningstar analyst Damien Conover estimates that by 2015, Asia will represent 51% of the infant and child nutrition market, up from 46% now.
"
921,PRGO,"The global market leader is Mead Johnson Nutrition (MJN), maker of the Enfamil brand. Like its rivals, Mead is seeing much of its growth come from East Asia. In its most recent quarter, its North American sales rose 10% year-over-year but sales in China and Hong Kong rose around 30%.
"
922,PRGO,"Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) spun off Mead in 2009. Since then, Mead shares have nearly tripled even as its parent's has stayed roughly flat. The success of that spinoff might be why Pfizer (PFE) said in July that it's thinking of selling its infant-nutrition business.

"
928,PRGO,"Euromonitor estimates the market will keep growing about 17% a year through 2015. But the field is getting more crowded, and established players know they can't keep relying on scandals and recalls to keep down rivals.

929,PRGO,"""The China market is intensely competitive,"" said Mead Johnson CEO Stephen Golsby in the firm's Q2 conference call. ""Yes, we're investing there both in advertising, promotion and in salesforce expansion, but we're not alone ... . And it would be unexpected for us to continue to grow share at the rate that we're currently growing.""You might not think a country with a one-child-only policy would be a booming market for infant formula, but China has become one of the hottest markets for U.S. suppliers, who are responding by stepping up production and prices.Abbott Laboratories (ABT) said Aug. 16 that it's investing $230 million to build a new powdered-milk plant in Jiaxing, which it calls its largest investment in China to date. Abbott spokesman Pete Paradossi says even with the one-child policy, some 17 million babies are born in the Middle Kingdom every year. And they capture and consume more attention and resources than ever before.""That growing middle class is really demanding higher-quality products and can afford the premium-priced products as well,"" Paradossi told IBD. ""With one child, you've got two parents, you've got two (sets of) grandparents, and many times you've got great-grandparents all wanting to do what's best for that child.""Another U.S. player jockeying for position is Perrigo (PRGO). Like Abbott, Perrigo is better known as a drugmaker, mostly of private-label over-the-counter medicines. But last year it moved into the infant-nutrition business with its $808 million buyout of PBM Holdings.'Made In U.S.A.' Label SellsOn the same day that Abbott announced its new plant, Perrigo CEO Joe Papa told investors in a conference call that Asia represented a ""major opportunity"" in infant formula, especially for U.S. companies.""We believe we've got a quality product,"" Perrigo said. ""That is very important to people in Asia because it's made in U.S.A., and we believe that made in U.S.A. is an important quality advantage vs. some of the concerns that have occurred in Asia with another infant formula.""Papa's comment hints at the darker reason U.S. companies are doing well: the scandal that erupted in late 2008 when melamine was discovered in Chinese powdered milk supplies. More than 800 infants wound up hospitalized, and six of them died. In July 2010, more contaminated powder was seized in Qinghai.Paradossi says China is ""beginning to move in the right direction"" in quality standards, but says local suppliers still have a serious trust problem. He points out that 100% of the milk Abbott uses in its Chinese formulas is imported.The melamine scandal hasn't prodded Chinese parents to give up on infant formula.

945,PRGO,"Whoa boy, there's gonna be an IBD 50 earnings party on Thursday! Well, maybe it will be a party. Maybe it will be a funeral. In all likelihood, it will be a mishmash of both.Investors don't need to be reminded that earnings day is hold-onto-your-hat day. All an investor can do is be on guard. Be ready to sell if things go badly. Be ready to celebrate if things go grandly.Earnings are always a mixed bag, and in an already shaky market (though in a confirmed uptrend starting last week) things can get dicey.IBD 50 companies usually have pretty high expectations, as you'd expect of a top stock. So even when their quarterly numbers are very good, the results can disappoint analysts and investors. (Apple (AAPL), for example.)So IBD 50 followers will be hanging on the edge of their PCs (or smartphones or tablets) on Thursday, Oct. 27, when no less than five tech and biomed IBD 50ers are set to report. They are, by their IBD 50 rankings:10. Perrigo (PRGO). Perrigo has led IBD's 15-stock Medical Generic Drugs group for months (along with fellow IBD 50er Watson Pharmaceuticals (WPI). The maker of generic drugs that carry the brand names of the stores that sell them, such as CVS (CVS) and Target (TGT), hit an all-time high above 100 on Sept. 27 and has hung pretty close to that level ever since. Perrigo CEO Joseph Papa has said he sees the company's market share for store-brand products topping 40% at some point vs. about 30% today. Perrigo, which entered the infant formula biz with last year's purchase of PBM, last week said it would supply infant formula manufactured in its U.S. facilities for sale and distribution by Founder Pharma in China. On Thursday, analysts expect Perrigo to report (before the open) EPS of $1.05, up 21%, on sales of $750.1 million, up 17%. Both percentage gains, while solid, are down from the preceding quarter. It's trading less than 3% above a 94.71 buy point hit last month.14. Cerner (CERN). The maker of electronic health records, or EHR, software tends to beat EPS views by a penny or two every quarter. It faces a test on Thursday. Analysts expect EPS ex items of 47 cents, up 24%, on sales of $533.3 million, up 15%. That 15% would match the previous quarter as the biggest sales jump since Q4 2008. The EPS would be the most in at least four years, but percentagewise would be down a tad from the previous two quarters. Federal rules that encourage electronic health records have helped Cerner and some of its rivals. Here's our latest story on that subject . The stock is trading just a tad below a 68.03 buy point hit last month, and it's been hanging pretty close to its 10-week line.21. Celgene (CELG). The maker of cancer drugs is another med stock trading a bit past a buy point. It hit a buy point of 62.59 last month and now trades more than 6% higher, near a three-year high. As we reported, , a European regulatory panel earlier this month made a favorable ruling for the company's Revlimid, its successor to thalidomide, the drug of choice for treating the blood cancer multiple myeloma. This ruling could pave the way for big approvals next year. Investment bank Rodman & Renshaw initiated coverage of Celgene on Oct. 14 with a rating of market outperform, or buy. Analysts expect Celgene, which like Perrigo reports before the open, to report EPS of 95 cents, up 27%, on sales of $1.2 billion, up 32%. Those percentages are down from the previous two quarters. Celgene has beaten EPS views by 3 cents in each of the past two quarters.27. SolarWinds (SWI). No, our Oct. 27 reporting class does not consist solely of medical stocks. The maker of software that helps manage computer networks and other information technology systems reports before the open that day. Analysts expect EPS ex items to rise 10% to 23 cents, which would be the smallest percentage increase in years. But the company has been growing solidly. Sales are expected to come in at $51.7 million, up 26%. The stock is pretty steadily staying above its 10-week line, but is trading more than 8% below an all-time high set in June. As we reported recently , the company is expanding productwise and regionwise.49. KLA-Tencor (KLAC). The maker of equipment used to manufacture computer chips returned to the IBD 50 the week of Oct. 5 after a long absence. The stock is up about 30% since early September. The stock is also down about 20% from a more than four-year high hit in early March. The chip gear field, though, is notoriously cyclical. IBD's 45-company Electronics-Semiconductor Equipment group ranks just No. 96 out of the 197 groups tracked by IBD. But that's up from No. 151 eight weeks ago and down from No. 35 26 weeks ago. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect KLA to report, after the close Thursday, that fiscal Q1 EPS rose 18% to $1.17 and sales rose 16% to $791.9 million. But the company had more than doubled its year-over-year EPS in each of the four previous quarters, and sales would rise by the smallest percentage in seven quarters. KLA has beaten profit views by at least 5 cents in each of the past six quarters, include beating by 13 cents in the previous quarter.Follow Mike Krey on Twitter.

983,PRGO,"Goldstein: We won't do anything differently. We stay true to our process. There are occasions when our approach, like in Q4, is completely out of favor. But even when we underperform in a tough quarter, our long-term performance remained strong.
"
984,PRGO,"IBD: Have you fished for bargains?
"
985,PRGO,"Goldstein: Yes. Some of our favorite growth companies' earnings prospects have stayed strong while their valuations have been compressed. So we've added to or repurchased names after not having owned them for a bit.
"
986,PRGO,"IBD: Such as?
"
987,PRGO,"Goldstein: Citrix Systems (CTXS). They're involved in desktop virtualization. Much like the way that VMware (VMW), a provider of software behind virtualization servers, helps client enterprises with efficiency and cost reductions, Citrix lets enterprises purchase less powerful desktop computers for employees and manage the software more centrally. It's much less expensive than maintaining software on each desktop.
"
988,PRGO,"We sold Citrix last year because we felt the cycle for desktop virtualization was advancing at a slower pace than anticipated. The growth thesis was not coming true. But even when we sell a company, we keep monitoring it. It may get to a point where we want to buy it back. And since then we've seen more evidence that desktop virtualization is advancing, so we added it back.
"
989,PRGO,"IBD: What's another example?
"
990,PRGO,"Goldstein: Amazon (AMZN). We added to our holding this year. The reason is that while it has not been controversial that revenue growth has been strong, we believe Amazon is gaining share within online sales while at the same time online is gaining share from bricks-and-mortars.
"
991,PRGO,"Many investors were concerned that Amazon's profitability was permanently impaired as it made significant infrastructure investments and as its shipping costs as a percent of sales have gone up quite a bit.
"
992,PRGO,"We believe in Q1 there were signs that margins were at least stabilizing and perhaps showing early signs of improving.
"
993,PRGO,"IBD: Where is the bargain bin aspect?
"
994,PRGO,"Goldstein: It's hard to argue that Amazon is super cheap. But we felt it was attractively valued as growth continued and margins stabilized or improved. For example, shipping costs as a percent of sales declined for the first time in three years.
"
995,PRGO,"But, yes, we did add more stable companies because of the challenging economic environment.
"
996,PRGO,"IBD: Some examples, please.
"
997,PRGO,"Goldstein: In the consumer space, PetSmart (PETM). They have merchandizing initiatives that will allow for accelerating growth within each store. Same-store comps should improve. It's already happening to some degree. So there's an earnings upside surprise opportunity as well. If sales are better than expectations, that can lead profits above expectations.
"
998,PRGO,"In health care, Idexx Laboratories (IDXX) provides veterinary lab testing products. They benefit from the rising trend of pet adoptions.
"
999,PRGO,"We think rising pet adoptions is a sign of the economy being a little better. Employment trends are a little better. Housing is bottoming or improving. Residential rental activity is up. More people are moving out of their parents' homes and starting households.
"
1000,PRGO,"IBD: In general, what's your approach?
"
1001,PRGO,"Goldstein: First, we buy a subset of a highly selective universe of what we call exceptional growth companies. The subset is those companies for which our expectations most exceed consensus expectations.
"
1002,PRGO,"Second, we develop a proprietary growth thesis for each holding.
"
1003,PRGO,"We hold each investment for the vast majority of its opportunity. When that opportunity no longer exists, we sell. It's critically important to sell when it is appropriate.
"
1004,PRGO,"One last thing we do is construct a balanced portfolio. Our objective is to dampen volatility.
"
1005,PRGO,"IBD: You do that through diversification, right?
"
1006,PRGO,"Goldstein: Yes. We diversify by sectors, by market capitalizations and by style.
"
1007,PRGO,"IBD: What is style diversification?
"
1008,PRGO,"Goldstein: We have cyclical growth names, more stable growth names and high growth companies.
"
1009,PRGO,"We don't own many companies domiciled outside the U.S. But we have a meaningful number of holdings that have revenue exposure outside the U.S.
"
1010,PRGO,"One way we don't diversify is by relative weighting. We don't allow ourselves to have more than 10 percentage points more or less than a sector's weighting in the Russell 1000 Growth Index. We're typically closer to the benchmark weighting than that.
"
1011,PRGO,"And we allow ourselves as much as a 300 basis points overweight on any individual security. Again, in practice our largest overweights tend to average about 200 basis points.
"
1012,PRGO,"IBD: Does your diversification within sectors reflect your style diversification?
"
1013,PRGO,"Goldstein: Right. Our health care holdings, for example, are not all of the same type.
"
1014,PRGO,"We own Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN), a fast-growing, high-multiple pharmaceutical company. The company is involved with ultrarare disease pharmaceuticals. We also own Gilead Sciences (GILD), which is involved with hepatitis C vaccines. And we own Vertex (VRTX), which is also involved with hepatitis C, but whose next opportunity is (the drug Kalydeco for) treatment of cystic fibrosis. Those biotech companies are developing tomorrow's cures.
"
1015,PRGO,"Also, we own Perrigo (PRGO), which is a more stable company that is the leading maker of store-brand over-the-counter medicines.
"
1016,PRGO,"IBD: Describe your diversification within another sector, such as consumer discretionary, please.
"
1017,PRGO,"Goldstein: On the one hand we own Dollar Tree (DLTR) and TJX Cos. (TJX). Of course they benefit from the reality that more people are economically challenged and are trading down to dollar stores and discount stores.
"
1018,PRGO,"On the other hand, we own Lululemon Athletica (LULU) and Coach (COH). Both of those are focused on a much higher-end demographic, more of a luxury end.
"
1019,PRGO,"IBD: How does this approach show up in your largest sector, technology, with 33% of your assets?
"
1020,PRGO,"Goldstein: On the one hand we have Apple (AAPL). Like Lululemon it is gaining meaningful, profitable market share and tends to sell higher priced products to a more affluent demographic.
"
1021,PRGO,"On the other hand we own Accenture (ACN), which is a consulting and outsourcing company, which serves global Fortune 100 companies. Apple is consumer focused. Accenture is enterprise focused, helping clients cut costs.
"
1022,PRGO,"We also have Visa (V) and MasterCard (MA), which fall into the tech sector but aren't tech per se. But they do use a lot of technology in what they do. They're really about increasing the use of plastic globally as a method of payment. There's terrific profitability that accrues to Visa and MasterCard. The more that people swipe cards, the incremental costs to Visa and MasterCard are way below their incremental revenues. It's a terrific margin opportunity.
"
1023,PRGO,"IBD: Apple's recent quarterly earnings report disappointed. Do you see a long-term problem?
"
1024,PRGO,"Goldstein: We don't believe it's a sign of any long-term crack. Our thesis is that they will gain profitable global market share in consumer electronics. When we first bought Apple, all it meant was Mac computers. Now they have mobile phones, and a new category they invented, tablets. All of that is still intact.
"
1025,PRGO,"One reason there was a pause (in Apple stock performance) is that many consumers are waiting for the next iteration of the iPhone before updating. I'm one of them. Pent-up demand for the iPhone 5 is large, not only among existing iPhone users but also among consumers who don't own an iPhone. So it's a temporary pause (in sales) before a bigger ramp-up later this year and next year.
"
1026,PRGO,"IBD: Teradata (TDC) has four quarters of 25% or higher earnings per share growth. What's your thesis?
"
1027,PRGO,"Goldstein: They benefit from the proliferation of data. They sell hard and software combinations that let very large enterprises collect and analyze large amounts of data, which in turn they use to make strategic decisions.
"
1028,PRGO,"Demand for data analytics and their other services is very strong. So we love their top-line growth. We look for companies with top-line growth, not just margin improvement.
"
1029,PRGO,"IBD: Netsuite's (N) EPS growth jumped to 100% and 200% the past two quarters. What's your take?
"
1030,PRGO,"Goldstein: This is one of our emerging high growth, high valuation companies.
"
1031,PRGO,"They're in software-as-a-service, so it's a cloud play. Like Salesforce.com (CRM) they benefit from enterprises that want to get business-critical software through cloud delivery. It's software on a buy-as-you-need-it basis, rather than owning an old-fashioned in-house suite of software.
"
1032,PRGO,"IBD: Is Cerner's (CERN) story basically the shift to electronic health care records?
"
1033,PRGO,"Goldstein: Cerner is one of the leading public companies in health care information technology. They have a strong backlog, whether it's due to government regulatory changes or merely a reflection of economics encouraging hospitals to automate and digitize. This is a really well run, leading health care IT company.
"
1034,PRGO,"IBD: Monster Beverage (MNST) has two quarters of accelerating EPS growth. What's your view?
"
1035,PRGO,"Goldstein: Monster has done well and is still attractive. They are gaining share within the energy drink market. Their international opportunities are sizable. As they mature internationally, there's a nice margin improvement opportunity as well. We own it for reasons other than it might get purchased by, for example, Coke (KO). But we're not betting on that.
"
1036,PRGO,"IBD: Whole Foods (WFM) has exploded off its recession trough. How much more can this specialty market grow?
"
1037,PRGO,"Goldstein: We believe there is still a lot of room to run. Their same-store sales in a tough economy suggest they deliver what American consumers want. Comps were up 8% (in fiscal Q3). The rise in store-level operating margins shows great discipline. We expect they will continue to grow their store base. Combined with same-store growth, you get meaningful profit growth.
"
1038,PRGO,"IBD: GNC's (GNC) EPS growth has slowed for two quarters. Do they need a shot of Geritol?
"
1039,PRGO,"Goldstein: In the most recent quarter, same-store sales were up almost 13%, which is higher than most retailers.
"
1040,PRGO,"Secondly, their opportunity to grow internationally attracts us.
"
1041,PRGO,"We think earnings estimates will rise the rest of this year and most of next year. Collectively, all of those factors point to an attractive opportunity.The $570 million Nuveen Large Cap Growth Opportunities is a top echelon portfolio, seeking to resume its winning ways after having hit a rough patch in 2011.The fund's average annual gain of 14.60% in the three years going into Thursday ranked in the top 16% of its large-cap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc. But in calendar 2011 its 2.69% loss meant it trailed 56% of its peers.This year the fund is up 9.81% vs. 9.15% for its category and 10.69% for the S&P 500.Hal Goldstein, 53 years old, is co-lead manager with Scott Mullinix. James Diedrich is co-manager. Goldstein discussed his approach from his office in Minneapolis.IBD: What are you doing differently this year?Goldstein: We were challenged particularly in the fourth quarter. There was a rapid turn toward stocks that benefit from an economic recovery — lower-quality, more cyclical names. And that's the environment in which we do least well.Our year was sort of respectable. We were in the middle of the pack.IBD: And this year?Goldstein: We won't do anything differently.

Imbuing bulls and bears into action, the headlines don't yield much of a clue with ""Risk Creates Opportunity"" from MarketWatch and ""4 Stocks with Potential for the New Year"" courtesy of Forbes trying to tease and cajole bulls into a more offensive frame of mind.
"
1056,PRGO,"With today's pressure in shares, QCOR is breaking key 50-day simple moving average support. The action has also damaged a prior breakout attempt from a four-week flat base which triggered back in early December as the stock is now more than 8% below its proper buy point of 44.61.

1057,PRGO,"Most active on the option side and for all intents and purposes, the only decisive action on the day, nearly 1,200 slightly out-of-the money January 37 puts on multiple and varied prints have traded compared to almost non-existent open interest of 33 contracts. 
"
1058,PRGO,"Priced at $1.27 mid-market, a long put purchase would require a maximum move of 14% by expiration in order to double in value to about $2.50. Our guesstimate, based on the fast deteriorating technical picture, sees the put purchase as the most likely beneficiary of today's opening activity from traders. 
"
1059,PRGO,"Knowing there's two sides to every trade though, Tuesday's initiating traders, which we'd also gather is the result of a newsletter recommendation, could be using a ""targeted purchase"" strategy, which more commonly is known as a put sale and less acknowledged, as the risk equivalent of the buy-write.
"
1060,PRGO,"And as we stated just last week, when it comes to options and the fact stock can always complicate just which side of the trade our two parties are in fact on, we'd be remiss not to mention the possibility of a married put or the less likely synthetic short call as positions. For its part, with shares at 39.90, the married put or long synthetic call affords bulls protection at the strike price minus the premium paid. This adds up to, without really knowing if it adds up at expiration, to risk of about $4.15 per contract below 35.75 using $1.25 as the put price.

Knowing there's two sides to every trade though, Tuesday's initiating traders, which we'd also gather is the result of a newsletter recommendation, could be using a ""targeted purchase"" strategy, which more commonly is known as a put sale and less acknowledged, as the risk equivalent of the buy-write.And as we stated just last week, when it comes to options and the fact stock can always complicate just which side of the trade our two parties are in fact on, we'd be remiss not to mention the possibility of a married put or the less likely synthetic short call as positions. For its part, with shares at 39.90, the married put or long synthetic call affords bulls protection at the strike price minus the premium paid. This adds up to, without really knowing if it adds up at expiration, to risk of about $4.15 per contract below 35.75 using $1.25 as the put price.What do you think?

Most analysts expect the Fed to wait until late this year or early 2011 to raise rates.Data since the Fed's last meeting in March suggest ""that economic activity has continued to strengthen and that the labor market is beginning to improve,"" the central bank said in its post-meeting statement.It added that ""growth in household spending has picked up recently but remains constrained by high unemployment, modest income growth, lower housing wealth, and tight credit.""Meanwhile, the Fed said business spending on equipment and software has risen ""significantly.""Kansas City Fed President Thomas Hoenig dissented for a third straight meeting, saying conditions had improved enough to end the vow to keep rates low for an extended period. Inflation hawks fear huge Fed cash infusions will cause prices to soar as the economy accelerates.But the Fed expects ""moderate"" economic growth for a time and that inflation will remain ""subdued"" amid tight credit and expectations that unemployment will remain high.The Fed said investment in nonresidential structures is declining and that housing starts ""edged up but remain at a depressed level.""The market returned to around session highs after the Fed announcement. The Dow and S&P 500 were up 0.7%, the NYSE composite 0.6% and the Nasdaq 0.2%. Volume remained lower across the board.U.S. Stocks Stay Mixed Ahead Of Fed

1847,PRGO,"Perrigo Company plc (PRGO  -  Free Report) is expected to report second-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Aug 10. Overall, the company has an average trailing four-quarter positive earnings surprise of 2.47%. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive surprise of 7.14%.Perrigo Company Price and EPS Surprise Perrigo Company Price and EPS Surprise | Perrigo Company QuotePerrigo’s shares have lost 19% so far this year, while the industry witnessed an increase of 18.3%.Let’s see how things are shaping up at the company this quarter.Factors Influencing This QuarterPrice erosion and changing market dynamics across Perrigo’s Prescription Pharmaceuticals (Rx) segment is likely to continue hurting the company’s performance. The company continues to expect a tough drug pricing environment to impact the segment’s performance. It anticipates price erosion of approximately 9-10% at the Rx segment in the coming quarters.The Branded Consumer Healthcare (BCH) business, a part of Consumer Health Care International (CHCI) segment, is still being impacted by unfavorable market dynamics in countries like Belgium, France, Germany and Italy. This BCH segment is projected to underperform in the yet-to-be-reported quarter due to lower-than-expected revenues from certain high-margin products.The U.S. Department of Justice Antitrust Division has been conducting an investigation at Perrigo, seeking information about the latter’s drug pricing practices. In May, the company announced that search warrants were executed at its corporate offices associated with the ongoing investigation. Hence, the company’s pricing strategies might get affected by such probes.However, Perrigo’s constant focus to pursue additional branded OTC opportunities in the U.S. market as well as product acquisitions and new products launches in the Rx segment are expected to boost sales in the future quarters. The ongoing restructuring initiatives and operating expense discipline are expected to support the bottom line.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Perrigo is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Perrigo is -2.13% as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 92 cents per share, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at 94 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Although Perrigo’s Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) increases the predictive power of ESP, its negative Earnings ESP leaves our earnings surprise prediction inconclusive.We caution against all Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are some other companies to consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to come up with an earnings beat this quarter:Zoetis Inc. (ZTS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release results on Aug 8 with an Earnings ESP of +1.89% and a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Tesaro, Inc.

1848,PRGO,"It’s been a tough week for generic drugmakers which saw their shares tumbling following the release of disappointing second quarter results from Israel-based Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (TEVA  -  Free Report). Teva not only missed on earnings and revenue expectations, the company also slashed its 2017 outlook and announced a 75% cut in its dividend.Teva’s shares plunged 34.1% in the two trading sessions following the release of second quarter results reflecting concerns about the company’s business and debt burden which triggered a few analyst downgrades. Year-to-date (YTD), Teva has lost 43.2% of its value versus the 12% decline of its industryChallenging Generic Pricing EnvironmentA key reason for Teva’s dismal performance was generic pricing erosion. The sharp decline in generic drug prices, while a blessing for patients, is proving to be a major challenge for generic drugmakers as well as drug distributors.On its second quarter conference call, Teva said that the ongoing consolidation of customers has led to increasing price erosion and decreasing volume. The consolidation in the industry has increased the ability to negotiate lower prices for generic drugs. Moreover, the FDA is speeding up the approval of generic drugs which means more competition, increasing price cuts and decreasing volume. Generic drugs are basically cheaper versions of branded drugs which have gone off patent.Teva said that price erosion was around 6% in the second quarter and is expected to increase to high-single digits over the remainder of the year.And it’s not just Teva that was affected by the tough generic pricing environment in the U.S. AmerisourceBergen Corporation (ABC  -  Free Report), which reported a mixed quarter, saw its shares decline 11.4% over the two trading sessions following the release of third quarter fiscal 2017 results. The company mentioned that generic deflation remains a headwind and is yet to ease from the high single digits, where it's been for about three quarters. Generic deflation is expected to remain a headwind for the remainder of fiscal 2017 in the range of -7% to -9%. The situation may continue in fiscal 2018 as well.Cardinal Health, Inc. (CAH  -  Free Report) too mentioned that generic drugs pricing was a material headwind for the company’s Pharma Distribution business in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. The company expects generic deflation in mid-single digits in fiscal 2018.Stocks in FocusFollowing the release of Teva’s second quarter results, companies with a presence in the generics market saw their shares declining on concerns that these companies too will be affected by the generic drug pricing environment. Companies like Mylan NV (MYL  -  Free Report), down 10.8%), Lannett Company, Inc. (LCI  -  Free Report), 10.9% down), Perrigo Company plc (PRGO  -  Free Report), down 6.5%) and Impax Laboratories, Inc. , down 10.7%) were down over the last two trading sessions. This week, investors will be focused on Mylan’s second quarter results including the company’s take on the generic pricing situation. Impax and Perrigo will also be reporting results this week. While Mylan, Perrigo and Impax are all Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stocks, Lannett is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. Medical - Generic Drugs Industry 5YR % Return Medical - Generic Drugs Industry 5YR % ReturnIn our view, generic price erosion will remain a headwind for the remainder of the year and affect the margins of generic players. With the FDA focusing on speeding up the generic drug approval process, the market will continue to witness additional competition and escalating generic price erosion.5 Trades Could Profit ""Big-League"" from Trump PoliciesIf the stocks above spark your interest, wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington's changing course.Today Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals, tariffs, lower taxes, higher interest rates, and spending surges in defense and infrastructure.

Annual market sales for Androgel Topical Gel, 1.62% packets for the 12 months ending May 2017 were about $88 million.Shares of Perrigo have significantly underperformed the Zacks classified Medical Products industry so far this year. The stock has declined 12.8% against the broader industry’s gain of 21.3%.Simultaneously, Perrigo also declared that its subsidiary has filed a Paragraph IV Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) with the FDA for a generic version of Galderma’s Soolantra (ivermectin) cream, 1% indicated for the treatment of inflammatory lesions of rosacea. Soolantra’s annual market sales for the 12 months ending May 2017 were $87 million.However, on the same date, Perrigo settled the litigation related to Meda Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Cipla Ltd’s generic version of Dymista (azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate) nasal spray. Dymista is indicated for the relief of symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis in patients between six years of age and older, who require treatment with both azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate for symptomatic relief.The approval for the generic version of a drug bodes well for the company as it will help in boosting revenues.

1850,PRGO,"Mergers and acquisitions (M&As) continue to play a major role in the pharma sector and are not showing any signs of slowing down. The last few months have brought tax inversion deals into focus considering the number of agreements signed with ex-U.S. companies.
"
1851,PRGO,"Tax inversion focused deals involve the creation of a more efficient tax structure. These deals, which were earlier popular among mid-sized companies, are picking up even among large-cap companies, prime examples being Pfizer’s (PFE  -  Free Report) unsuccessful attempt to acquire UK-based AstraZeneca (AZN) and AbbVie’s (ABBV) agreement to acquire Shire (SHPG). Through the Shire acquisition, AbbVie will not only boost its product portfolio, it is will also be able to cut its tax rate to 13% by 2016.
"
1852,PRGO,"Other such moves have been made by companies like Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report), Salix (SLXP), Actavis (ACT), Perrigo (PRGO  -  Free Report), Auxilium (AUXL) and Jazz (JAZZ  -  Free Report).
"
1853,PRGO,"While efforts are on to bring in more stringent anti-inversion rules, such deals will continue in the near term. In fact, expectations are high that Pfizer will resume talks to acquire AstraZeneca later this year.
"
1854,PRGO,"Meanwhile, we expect small bolt-on acquisitions to continue. In-licensing activities and collaborations for the development of pipeline candidates have also increased significantly. Several pharma companies are focusing on in-licensing mid-to-late stage pipeline candidates that look promising, instead of developing a product from scratch, which involves a lot of funds and time.

1855,PRGO,"Small biotech companies are open to in-licensing activities and collaborations. Most of these companies find it challenging to raise cash, thereby making it difficult for them to survive and continue with the development of promising pipeline candidates. Therefore, it makes sense for them to seek deals with pharma companies that are sitting on huge piles of cash.
"
1856,PRGO,"We recommend biotech stocks that have attractive pipeline candidates or technology that can be used for the development of novel therapeutics. Therapeutic areas which could see a lot of in-licensing activity include immuno-oncology, oncology, central nervous system disorders, diabetes and immunology/inflammation. The hepatitis C virus (HCV) market is also attracting a lot of attention -- Merck’s (MRK) $3.85 billion deal for acquiring Idenix (IDIX) will boost its HCV portfolio.
"
1857,PRGO,"Some recent acquisitions/deals include Actavis’ acquisition of Forest and Salix’s agreement to acquire Cosmo. Meanwhile, Valeant (VRX  -  Free Report) is pursuing Allergan (AGN).
"
1858,PRGO,"Another trend that we are seeing over the past few quarters is the divestment of non-core business segments. Companies like Pfizer, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK  -  Free Report) and AstraZeneca have all been a part of this trend.
"
1859,PRGO,"The monetization of non-core assets will allow the pharma/biotech companies to focus on their areas of expertise. Abbott Labs (ABT) recently signed a deal with Mylan for the sale of its non-U.S. developed markets specialty and branded generics business. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) divested its ortho-clinical diagnostics business. Vertex (VRTX) monetized its Incivo-related royalties; the company can use the cash generated from this deal for its cystic fibrosis program. Theravance (THRX) also split into two companies.
"
1860,PRGO,"Restructuring activities are also gaining momentum as large pharma companies are looking to cut costs and streamline their operations. Most of these companies are re-evaluating their pipelines and discontinuing programs which do not have a favorable risk-benefit profile. Some of the companies that announced restructuring plans include Allergan, Merck, Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report), Eli Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report), Shire and Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report).New Products Hold Promise
"
1861,PRGO,"The worst of the patent cliff is over for the pharmaceutical sector which is slowly but steadily recovering from the impact of genericization. Many companies, which had been struggling to post growth in the face of genericization over the past few years, are now on the recovery path. New products should start contributing significantly to results, and increased pipeline visibility and appropriate utilization of cash should increase confidence in the sector.
"
1862,PRGO,"2013 saw the FDA approving 27 novel medicines, about one-third (33%) of which were identified by the FDA as “First-in-Class,” meaning they use a new and unique mechanism of action for treating a medical condition. These include drugs like Invokana (type II diabetes), Kadcyla (HER2-positive late-stage breast cancer), Sovaldi (an interferon-free oral treatment for some patients with chronic hepatitis C) and Mekinist (metastatic melanoma).
"
1863,PRGO,"Yet another one-third of the approved drugs fall under the rare or “orphan” disease category that affects 200,000 or fewer people in the U.S. These include Imbruvica (mantle cell lymphoma), Gazyva (chronic lymphocytic leukemia), Kynamro (homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia) and Adempas and Opsumit (both for pulmonary arterial hypertension). Three of the approved drugs – Gazyva, Imbruvica and Sovaldi – had breakthrough therapy designation. Breakthrough status, a new designation that became effective after Jul 9, 2012, is designed to cut short the development time of promising new treatments.
"
1864,PRGO,"Some important products approved in 2013 include:
"
1865,PRGO,"Drugs like Tecfidera, Sovaldi, Olysio and Imbruvica are off to a strong start and represent significant commercial potential.
"
1866,PRGO,"So far in 2014, drugs that have gained approval include AstraZeneca’s Myalept (complications of leptin deficiency) and Farxiga (type II diabetes), Chelsea Therapeutics’ (CHTP) Northera (to treat neurogenic orthostatic hypotension), BioMarin’s (BMRN) Vimizim (Morquio A syndrome), Vanda’s (VNDA) Hetlioz (non-24- hour sleep-wake disorder) and MannKind’s (MNKD  -  Free Report) Afrezza.
"
1867,PRGO,"Immuno-oncology is another area that has been in the limelight especially after a good showing at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO). Immuno-oncology therapies have the potential to change the treatment paradigm for cancer -- they basically use the natural capability of the patient's own immune system to fight the cancer.
"
1868,PRGO,"Major players in this field include Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), AstraZeneca, Merck, and Roche –- these companies came out with data on their immuno-oncology candidates at ASCO. Deals targeting immuno-oncology are being inked by companies like Bristol-Myers, AstraZeneca and Incyte (INCY).Emerging Markets and Biosimilars
"
1869,PRGO,"Another trend seen in the pharmaceutical sector is a focus on emerging markets. Companies like Mylan, Pfizer, Merck, Eli Lilly, Glaxo and Sanofi are all looking to expand their presence in India, China, Brazil and other emerging markets.
"
1870,PRGO,"Until recently, most of the commercialization efforts were focused on the U.S. -- the largest pharmaceutical market -- along with Europe and Japan. Emerging markets are slowly and steadily gaining more importance, and several companies are now shifting their focus to these areas.
"
1871,PRGO,"However, while higher demand for medicines, government initiatives for healthcare, new patient population and increasing use of generics should help drive demand, we point out that emerging markets are also not immune to genericization. Moreover, investigations into bribery charges in China could put a lid on near-term growth.
"
1872,PRGO,"Meanwhile, growth in Europe will continue to be pressurized by austerity and cost-containment measures.
"
1873,PRGO,"We are also seeing several companies entering into deals for the development of biosimilars, generic versions of biologics. Companies like Merck, Amgen, Biogen and Actavis are all targeting the highly lucrative biosimilars market.Earnings Trends (as of Jul 16)
"
1874,PRGO,"The Q2 earnings season has just started with only 6% of the medical companies releasing their financial results. So far, the earnings ""beat ratio"" (percentage of companies coming out with positive surprises) is 100%, while the revenue ""beat ratio"" is 33.3%. Total earnings were up 11.6%, while total revenue improved 7.2% in the quarter.
"
1875,PRGO,"With a major part of the medical sector yet to report Q2 results, earnings and revenue forecasts for Q2 stand at 4.3% and 8.5%, respectively. This compares to 6.4% and 8.0% earnings and revenue growth, respectively, in Q1. Factors like negative currency movement and a few patent expiries will affect second quarter growth.
"
1876,PRGO,"The picture becomes brighter in the second half of the year with Q3 and Q4 earnings growth expected to be 5.5% and 15.2%, respectively. Revenues are expected to grow 8.6% and 7.8% in the third and fourth quarters of 2014, respectively. New product sales should pick up significantly in the second half of the year.
"
1877,PRGO,"Overall, 2014 earnings are expected to grow 10.6%. For a detailed look at the earnings outlook for the Medical and other sectors, please check our Zacks Earnings Trends report.
"
1878,PRGO,"The NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index (^DRG) is up 20.9% over the last year and 8.9% so far this year. The sector benefited from ongoing M&A activities and an encouraging show at ASCO.Zacks Industry Rank
"
1879,PRGO,"Within the Zacks Industry classification, pharma and biotech are broadly grouped into the Medical sector (one of 16 Zacks sectors) and further sub-divided into four industries at the expanded level: large-cap pharma, med-biomed/gene, med-drugs and med-generic drugs.
"
1880,PRGO,"We rank all the 260-plus industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each industry. To learn more, visit: About Zacks Industry Rank.
"
1881,PRGO,"As a point of reference, the outlook for industries with Zacks Industry Rank #88 and lower is ‘Positive,’ between #89 and #176 is ‘Neutral’ and #177 and higher is ‘Negative.’
"
1882,PRGO,"The Zacks Industry Rank for large-cap pharma is #91, med-biomed/gene is #100, med-drugs is #100, while med-generic drugs is #57. Analyzing the Zacks Industry Rank for different medical segments, it is obvious that the outlook is Positive for med-generic drugs and Neutral for med-drugs, med-biomed/gene and large-cap pharma stocks.OPPORTUNITIES
"
1883,PRGO,"While several companies will continue to face challenges like EU austerity measures and genericization, the pharma industry is out of the worst of its genericization phase. Many companies which had faced generic headwinds in the last couple of years should continue to see sustained improvement in results this year.
"
1884,PRGO,"Cost-cutting, downsizing, streamlining of the pipeline, growth in emerging markets and new product launches should support growth.
"
1885,PRGO,"Among pharma stocks, Allergan, a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock, looks well-positioned for growth. The company is currently in the news thanks to strong second quarter results, its restructuring initiatives and the ongoing efforts of Valeant to acquire the company.
"
1886,PRGO,"Specialty pharma company Salix, which boosted its portfolio and strengthened its position in the gastrointestinal market through the Santarus acquisition earlier this year, looks well-poised for growth. The company’s upcoming merger with Cosmo will allow it to enjoy a tax efficient corporate structure and further strengthen its position in the gastrointestinal diseases market. Salix is also a Zacks Rank #1 stock.
"
1887,PRGO,"Other well-ranked pharma companies include AstraZeneca and Pfizer -- both are Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stocks.
"
1888,PRGO,"In the biotech space, we are positive on AbbVie -- the Zacks Rank #2 company recently announced its intention to acquire Shire. The upcoming acquisition will not only lead to a more efficient tax structure, AbbVie will also benefit from Shire’s strong product portfolio and pipeline.
"
1889,PRGO,"Biogen, another Zacks Rank #2 stock, also looks well-positioned. Tecfidera, the company’s recently launched oral multiple sclerosis drug, is off to a strong start with the product delivering sales of $876 million (as of Dec 31, 2013) since its launch in early April 2013. While Tecfidera has gained the top spot in the oral multiple sclerosis market in the U.S., Avonex and Tysabri should continue contributing significantly to sales. Tecfidera gained EU approval recently. Biogen is also progressing with its hemophilia drugs.
"
1890,PRGO,"Other well-ranked biotech stocks include BioMarin, The Medicines Co. (MDCO), Celgene, Pharmacyclics, Aegerion (AEGR), Theravance and Incyte (INCY). While BioMarin and The Medicines Co. are Zacks Rank #1 stocks, the others carry a Zacks Rank #2.
"
1891,PRGO,"Among generic companies, Teva (TEVA), Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories (RDY) and Akorn (AKRX) all carry a Zacks Rank #2.WEAKNESSES
"
1892,PRGO,"We recommend avoiding names that offer little growth or opportunity for a take-out. These include companies which are developing drugs that are likely to face regulatory hurdles.
"
1893,PRGO,"Large-cap pharma companies that currently carry a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) include Novo Nordisk (NVO) and Sanofi. Among biotech stocks, Auxilium is going through a challenging time -- the Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock cut its revenue guidance primarily due to lower-than-expected Testim revenues. Companies like Cubist, Nektar (NKTR) and NPS Pharma (NPSP) also carry a Zacks Rank #5.
"
1894,PRGO,"The pharmaceutical sector has been slowly but steadily recovering from the impact of the patent cliff being faced by several companies over the past few years. The worst of the patent cliff is over and the NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index (^DRG) is up 21.4% over the last year. So far in 2014, the index is up 6.9%.
"
1895,PRGO,"Several companies which had been struggling to post growth in the face of genericization over the past few years are now on the recovery path. New products should start contributing significantly to results, and increased pipeline visibility and appropriate utilization of cash should increase confidence in the sector.
"
1896,PRGO,"Products that lost exclusivity recently include Eli Lilly’s (LLY) Cymbalta and Evista. AstraZeneca’s (AZN) Nexium could also start facing generics from May 2014 in the U.S. where sales were $2.1 billion in 2013.Collaborations, Acquisitions and Restructuring
"
1897,PRGO,"The pharma sector witnessed major merger and acquisitions (M&A) activity over the last couple of years. Going forward, we expect small bolt-on acquisitions to continue. In-licensing activities and collaborations for the development of pipeline candidates have also increased significantly. Several pharma companies are focusing on in-licensing mid-to-late stage pipeline candidates that look promising, instead of developing a product from scratch, which involves a lot of funds and time.
"
1898,PRGO,"Small biotech companies are open to in-licensing activities and collaborations.

Therapeutic areas which could see a lot of in-licensing activity include immuno-oncology, oncology, central nervous system disorders, diabetes and immunology/inflammation. The hepatitis C virus (HCV) market is also attracting a lot of attention.
"
1900,PRGO,"Some recent acquisitions/deals include Shire’s (SHPG) acquisition of ViroPharma, Salix’s (SLXP) acquisition of Santarus as well as the acquisition of Optimer Pharmaceuticals and Trius Therapeutics by Cubist Pharmaceuticals (CBST) and that of Elan by Perrigo Company (PRGO  -  Free Report). A major acquisition agreement was announced recently -- that of Forest Labs (FRX) by Actavis (ACT). This deal shows the intention of generic companies to establish a strong position in the branded market. Another significant deal was the one signed between Celgene (CELG) and OncoMed Pharmaceuticals (OMED  -  Free Report) for the joint development and commercialization of up to six anti-cancer stem cell candidates from OncoMed's biologics pipeline.
"
1901,PRGO,"Another trend that we are seeing in recent months is the divestment of non-core business segments. Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) sold its Capsugel unit and its Nutrition business in Aug 2011 and Nov 2012, respectively. Pfizer then spun off its animal health business into a new company, Zoetis (ZTS  -  Free Report).
"
1902,PRGO,"Meanwhile, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) divested certain non-core brands from its Consumer Healthcare segment. In Aug 2011, AstraZeneca sold its Astra Tech business to DENTSPLY (XRAY  -  Free Report). The monetization of non-core assets will allow the pharma/biotech companies to focus on their areas of expertise. Abbott Labs (ABT) split into two separate publicly traded companies; while one company deals in diversified medical products, the other, AbbVie (ABBV), is focusing on research-based pharmaceuticals. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) is also looking to divest its ortho-clinical diagnostics business. Vertex (VRTX  -  Free Report) monetized its Incivo-related royalties; the company can use the cash generated from this deal for its cystic fibrosis program.
"
1903,PRGO,"Restructuring activities are also gaining momentum as large pharma companies are looking to cut costs and streamline their operations. Most of these companies are re-evaluating their pipelines and discontinuing programs which do not have a favorable risk-benefit profile. Some of the companies that announced restructuring plans include Merck (MRK  -  Free Report), Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report), Eli Lilly, Shire and Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report).Destination Ireland
"
1904,PRGO,"Of late, several companies have been looking towards Ireland for acquisitions. The latest company to join the Irish club is Horizon Pharma (HZNP) which is doing a reverse merger with Dublin-based Vidara. Tax benefits are a major attraction for such deals. Other such recent acquisitions include that of Warner Chilcott by Actavis and Elan by Perrigo.Emerging Markets and Biosimilars
"
1905,PRGO,"Another trend seen in the pharmaceutical sector is a focus on emerging markets. Companies like Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report), Pfizer, Merck, Eli Lilly, Glaxo and Sanofi are all looking to expand their presence in India, China, Brazil and other emerging markets.
"
1906,PRGO,"Until recently, most of the commercialization efforts were focused on the U.S. -- the largest pharmaceutical market -- along with Europe and Japan. Emerging markets are slowly and steadily gaining more importance, and several companies are now shifting their focus to these areas.

1909,PRGO,"We are also seeing several companies entering into deals for the development of biosimilars, generic versions of biologics. Companies like Merck, Amgen, Biogen (BIIB) and Actavis are all targeting the highly lucrative biosimilars market.4Q Earnings
"
1910,PRGO,"All companies falling under the Medical sector have reported fourth quarter and full year 2013 results. While earnings-beat and revenue-beat ratios (percentage of companies coming out with positive surprises) were pretty impressive, growth ratios were modest. Fourth quarter results were characterized by currency headwinds as well as the impact of generics.
"
1911,PRGO,"Fourth quarter 2013 earnings ""beat ratio"" was 74.0% while the revenue ""beat ratio"" was 76.0%. Total earnings for this sector were up 1.1%, compared to 0.2% recorded in the third quarter of 2013. Total revenues moved up 5.3% in the quarter versus 5.8% growth in the third quarter of 2013.
"
1912,PRGO,"Looking at the consensus earnings expectations for the first quarter, earnings are expected to decline 3.3%. Tough challenges for some companies, negative currency movement and a few patent expirees will affect first quarter growth. However, growth should pick up from the second quarter for which 1.6% earnings growth is expected.
"
1913,PRGO,"Overall, 2014 earnings are expected to grow 6.5%. For a detailed look at the earnings outlook for the Medical and other sectors, please check our Zacks Earnings Trends report.Focus on New Products
"
1914,PRGO,"2013 saw the FDA approving 27 novel medicines, about one-third (33%) of which were identified by the FDA as “First-in-Class,” meaning they use a new and unique mechanism of action for treating a medical condition. These include drugs like Invokana (type II diabetes), Kadcyla (HER2-positive late-stage breast cancer), Sovaldi (an interferon-free oral treatment for some patients with chronic hepatitis C) and Mekinist (metastatic melanoma).
"
1915,PRGO,"Yet another one-third of the approved drugs fall under the rare or “orphan” disease category that affects 200,000 or fewer Americans. These include Imbruvica (mantle cell lymphoma), Gazyva (chronic lymphocytic leukemia), Kynamro (homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia) and Adempas and Opsumit (both for pulmonary arterial hypertension). Three of the approved drugs – Gazyva, Imbruvica and Sovaldi – had breakthrough therapy designation. Breakthrough status, a new designation that became effective after Jul 9, 2012, is designed to cut short the development time of promising new treatments.
"
1916,PRGO,"Some important products approved in 2013 include:

"
1919,PRGO,"Upcoming events include FDA advisory panel review of the regulatory application for MannKind’s (MNKD) experimental diabetes treatment, Afrezza. April should be an active month with the agency expected to deliver a response on the approvability of several experimental drugs including Afrezza, Glaxo’s Eperzan (type II diabetes) and Arzerra (CLL).Zacks Industry Rank

Cost-cutting, downsizing, streamlining of the pipeline, growth in emerging markets and new product launches should support growth.
"
1925,PRGO,"Among pharma stocks, Shire, a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock, looks well-positioned for growth with the company expanding its product portfolio and pipeline through the acquisition of ViroPharma. Horizon Pharma, a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock, also seems on the right path with the company announcing its plans to acquire Ireland-based Vidara.
"
1926,PRGO,"In the biotech space, we are positive on Biogen. Tecfidera, the company’s recently launched oral multiple sclerosis drug, is off to a strong start with the product delivering sales of $876 million (as of Dec 31, 2013) since its launch in early April 2013. While Tecfidera has gained the top spot in the oral multiple sclerosis market in the U.S., Avonex and Tysabri should continue contributing significantly to sales. Tecfidera gained EU approval recently. Biogen is also progressing with its hemophilia pipeline.
"
1927,PRGO,"We are also positive on Amgen (AMGN). Amgen should be able to deliver on its long-term strategy based on expansion in key markets, launch of new manufacturing technologies, and pipeline development. Enbrel should continue performing well. Amgen’s late-stage pipeline is also moving along. While Amgen is a Zacks Rank #2 stock, Biogen is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.
"
1928,PRGO,"Gilead, a Zacks Rank #1 stock, continues to do well in the HIV segment and has a potential blockbuster in its portfolio in the form of HCV treatment, Sovaldi.
"
1929,PRGO,"Among generic companies, Actavis looks well-positioned. Actavis is slowly and steadily building its position in the branded market through acquisitions (Actavis Group, Warner Chilcott and the upcoming acquisition of Forest). With fewer major patent expiries slated to occur in the next few years, we are encouraged by Actavis’ focus on building its branded and biosimilars pipeline. The company carries a Zacks Rank #2.WEAKNESSES
"
1930,PRGO,"We recommend avoiding names that offer little growth or opportunity for a take-out. These include companies which are developing drugs that are likely to face regulatory hurdles.
"
1931,PRGO,"Among large-cap pharma companies, Eli Lilly is gearing up for another round of patent expiries -- Cymbalta in Dec 2013 and Evista this year. We prefer waiting on the sidelines until the company is able to emerge from the impact of genericization.  
"
1932,PRGO,"Companies that currently carry a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) include Bayer (BAYRY), Sanofi and Glaxo among others. Sanofi, which is facing currency headwinds, was in the news recently related to the development of its PCSK9 inhibitor, alirocumab. The FDA has asked Sanofi and partner Regeneron (REGN  -  Free Report) to evaluate potential neurocognitive adverse events across the global development program for alirocumab, especially in long-term studies. While results on PCSK9 inhibitors in development have been encouraging so far, this is the first time that serious safety concerns have been raised.
"
1933,PRGO,"With 2013 coming to an end, the worst of the patent cliff faced by the pharmaceutical sector is over. Major blockbuster drugs like Merck’s (MRK) Singulair, Pfizer’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Lipitor, Forest Laboratories’ (FRX) Lexapro, Sanofi/Bristol-Myers Squibbs’ (SNY  -  Free Report)/BMY) Plavix and Eli Lilly’s (LLY) Zyprexa representing combined branded sales worth more than $15 billion in lost patent protection over the last couple of years.
"
1934,PRGO,"However, the effect of the genericization of these products was felt mostly in 2012. While the industry won’t be completely free from genericization, the major patent expiries are over and done with.
"
1935,PRGO,"Several companies which had been struggling to post growth in the face of genericization over the past few years should see accelerated growth in 2014. New products should start contributing significantly to results and increased pipeline visibility and appropriate utilization of cash should increase confidence in the sector.
"
1936,PRGO,"Some products that are slated to lose patent protection later this year and next year include:AstraZeneca’s (AZN) Nexium could also start facing generics from 2014 in the U.S., where sales were $2.2 billion in 2012.Collaborations, Acquisitions and Restructuring

"
1944,PRGO,"Another trend seen in the pharmaceutical sector is a focus on emerging markets. Companies like Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report), Pfizer, Merck, Eli Lilly, Glaxo and Sanofi are all looking to expand their presence in India, China, Brazil and other emerging markets. Until recently, most of the commercialization efforts were focused on the U.S. market -- the largest pharmaceutical market -- along with Europe and Japan.

1947,PRGO,"We are also seeing several companies entering into deals for the development of biosimilars, generic versions of biologics. Companies like Merck, Amgen, Biogen (BIIB), and Actavis (ACT) are all targeting the highly lucrative biosimilars market.3Q Earnings
"
1948,PRGO,"All companies falling under the Medical sector have reported third quarter 2013 results. While earnings-beat and revenue-beat ratios (percentage of companies coming out with positive surprises) were pretty impressive, growth ratios were modest. Third quarter results were characterized by currency headwinds especially in Japan as well as a slowdown in China where bribery investigations remained in the headlines.
"
1949,PRGO,"Third quarter 2013 earnings ""beat ratio"" was 74.5% while the revenue ""beat ratio"" was 51.0%. Total earnings for this sector were up 0.2%, compared to the 1.5% decline recorded in the second quarter of 2013. Total revenues moved up 5.8% in the quarter versus 2.4% growth in the second quarter of 2013.
"
1950,PRGO,"Looking at the consensus earnings expectations for the fourth quarter, earnings are expected to decline 3.5%. Tough challenges for some companies, negative currency movement and a few patent expiries will affect fourth quarter growth. With the year coming to an end, several companies maintained or narrowed their guidance ranges.
"
1951,PRGO,"Overall, 2013 earnings are expected to grow 0.6%.Focus on New Products
"
1952,PRGO,"2012 saw the FDA approving 35 novel medicines including the following:  
"
1953,PRGO,"Most of these products have been performing well so far in 2013. Stivarga, Kalydeco, Xtandi and Kyprolis, especially, represent strong commercial potential.
"
1954,PRGO,"So far in 2013, quite a few important products have gained approval including Biogen’s oral multiple sclerosis drug Tecfidera, Johnson & Johnson’s type II diabetes drug Invokana, Merck’s Liptruzet (cholesterol), Forest’s Fetzima (major depressive disorder), Pharmacyclics (PCYC)/Johnson & Johnson’s Imbruvica (mantle cell lymphoma) and Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Gazyva (chronic lymphocytic leukemia). Biogen’s Tecfidera is off to a strong start with sales surpassing expectations by a wide margin.
"
1955,PRGO,"Upcoming events include FDA advisory panel reviews of the biologic licensing application (BLA) for Bristol-Myers Squibbs’ metreleptin (rare forms of lipodystrophy) and dapagliflozin (type II diabetes), and Merck’s Grastek (a Timothy grass pollen extract tablet for sublingual use). All these reviews are scheduled to take place in the Dec 11 - 12 timeframe.
"
1956,PRGO,"A response on the approval status of Auxilium Pharma’s (AUXL) Xiaflex for Peyronie’s and Gilead’s sofosbuvir (chronic HCV infection) in the U.S. should also be out in December.Zacks Industry Rank
"
1957,PRGO,"Within the Zacks Industry classification, pharma and biotech are broadly grouped into the Medical sector (one of 16 Zacks sectors) and further sub-divided into four industries at the expanded level: large-cap pharma, med-biomed/gene, med-drugs and med-generic drugs.
"
1958,PRGO,"We rank all the 260-plus industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each industry. To learn more, visit: About Zacks Industry Rank.
"
1959,PRGO,"As a point of reference, the outlook for industries with Zacks Industry Rank #88 and lower is ‘Positive,’ between #89 and #176 is ‘Neutral’ and #177 and higher is ‘Negative.’
"
1960,PRGO,"The Zacks Industry Rank for large-cap pharma is #95, med-biomed/gene is #77, med-drugs is #66, while the med-generic drugs is #40. Analyzing the Zacks Industry Rank for different medical segments, it is obvious that the outlook is Positive for med-drugs, med-biomed/gene and med-generic drugs and Neutral for large-cap pharma stocks.OPPORTUNITIES
"
1961,PRGO,"The outlook for the pharma sector has improved significantly with the Zacks Industry Rank moving up from #195 to #95 over the past few months. While several companies will continue to face challenges like EU austerity measures and genericization, the pharma industry is out of the worst of the genericization phase.
"
1962,PRGO,"Many companies which had faced generic headwinds in the last couple of years should continue to see a sustained improvement in results as we move into 2014. Cost-cutting, downsizing, streamlining of the pipeline, growth in emerging markets and new product launches should support growth.
"
1963,PRGO,"Among large-cap pharma stocks, Bayer (BAYRY), a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock, looks well-positioned with several new products -- Eylea, Stivarga and Xarelto -- in its portfolio. These products represent significant commercial potential.Forest Labs (FRX), another Zacks Rank #2 stock, is doing well with first half fiscal 2014 results beating expectations. The company has launched several new products over the past few quarters and continues to work on expanding its pipeline. This company also raised its earning guidance for fiscal 2014.Shire (SHPG  -  Free Report), a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock, looks well-positioned for growth with the company expanding its product portfolio and pipeline through the upcoming acquisition of ViroPharma.
"
1964,PRGO,"We are positive on Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) even though the company currently holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The company has performed well so far this year and the momentum should continue. Johnson & Johnson upped its 2013 earnings guidance again after announcing third quarter results.
"
1965,PRGO,"The company has been trying to offset the declining sales of some of its important products by bringing in new products through in-licensing deals and acquisitions. We believe the diversity and strength of the company’s underlying businesses will continue to provide strong growth in future.
"
1966,PRGO,"In the biotech space, we are positive on Biogen (BIIB). Tecfidera, the company’s recently launched oral multiple sclerosis drug, is off to a strong start with the product delivering sales of $478 million since its launch in early April. While Tecfidera has gained the top spot in the oral multiple sclerosis market in the U.S., Avonex and Tysabri should continue contributing significantly to sales. Tecfidera should gain EU approval shortly. Biogen is also progressing with its hemophilia pipeline. Biogen is another company that raised its 2013 guidance again this year.
"
1967,PRGO,"We are also positive on Amgen (AMGN). Amgen should be able to deliver on its long-term strategy based on expansion in key markets, launch of new manufacturing technologies, and pipeline development. Enbrel should continue performing well. Amgen’s late-stage pipeline is also moving along. While Amgen is a Zacks Rank #2 stock, Biogen is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. Gilead, a Zacks Rank #3 stock, continues to do well in the HIV segment and is also progressing with its HCV pipeline.Medivation (MDVN), a Zacks Rank #2 company, should continue delivering with its prostate cancer therapy, Xtandi, performing well. Based on the data we have seen so far, we believe Xtandi has blockbuster potential. It is currently in several studies including for the pre-chemo setting. Expansion into the pre-chemo setting would be a major positive for Medivation.Vanda Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (VNDA  -  Free Report) also looks well-positioned with the company receiving a positive feedback from the FDA regarding insomnia candidate, tasimelteon. The FDA’s advisory panel voted resoundingly in favor of approving the candidate for the treatment of Non-24-Hour Disorder in the totally blind. While the FDA is not required to follow the advice of its advisory panel, it usually does so. A response from the agency should be out by Jan 31, 2014. Vanda is a Zacks Rank #1 stock.
"
1968,PRGO,"Among generic companies, Actavis (ACT) looks well-positioned. We view the acquisition of Actavis Group as a smart strategic move and we believe the company will be able to achieve its guidance easily. We are also positive on the recent acquisition of Warner Chilcott, which makes strategic and financial sense. With fewer major patent expiries slated to occur in the next few years, we are encouraged by Actavis’ focus on building its branded and biosimilars pipeline. The company carries a Zacks Rank #2.WEAKNESSES
"
1969,PRGO,"We recommend avoiding names that offer little growth or opportunity for a take-out. These include companies which are developing drugs that are likely to face regulatory hurdles. The FDA has been exercising more caution in granting approval to new products and several candidates are facing delays in receiving final approval.
"
1970,PRGO,"Among large-cap pharma companies, Eli Lilly (LLY) is gearing up for another round of patent expiries: Cymbalta in Dec 2013 and Evista next year. We prefer waiting on the sidelines until the company is able to emerge from the impact of genericization.
"
1971,PRGO,"Companies that currently carry a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) include Alkermes (ALKS), BioLineRx, Ltd. (BLRX) and XOMA Corporation (XOMA  -  Free Report) among others.
"
1972,PRGO,"Two weeks back, I offered my views on the New Year in an article titled ""My Outlook for 2012"".   
"
1973,PRGO,"My topic today is along the same lines, but with a minor twist. The focus today is on 2011; specifically the investment lessons learned from last year's market behavior. There is no rocket science here, but it pays to learn and re-learn some of these lessons, as the New Year will likely bring back some of the same situations.   
"
1974,PRGO,"We started 2011 on a very positive note, with expectations for GDP growth north of 3% in the U.S. The overall international backdrop appeared favorable, with Europe expected to struggle as a result of its debt overhang and the emerging markets expected to continue growing. The economic outlook soured significantly as oil prices rose following the so-called Arab Spring and as the Euro-zone issues expanded from Greece to other countries.   
"
1975,PRGO,"The noisy debt-ceiling debate and the rating downgrade added to the double-dip recession fears in the summer months. These fears eased only after economic readings turned around in the second half of the year, helping erase some of the losses from the first half. Europe remains a dark cloud in the New Year, but appears finally on track to put its arms around the issue in the coming months. It Pays to be Tactical 
"
1976,PRGO,"A distinct feature of the stock market in the last two years has been the very high level of correlation in stock prices. Stocks moved in-sync with each other, whether to the upside or to the downside, with little differentiated performance.   
"
1977,PRGO,"This behavior of high correlation is not unusual in times of macro uncertainty. After all, if the economy was to enter another recession, which was a major stock market obsession in the summer months, then all stocks would suffer. Ditto for contagion risk from Europe's debt woes.   
"
1978,PRGO,"A shifting macro backdrop is very unhelpful, to say the least, to a buy-and-hold type of investment strategy. You have to be nimble and tactical in navigating such a market. I am not advocating market timing and excessive trading action here. But you have to stay ready to promptly make changes to your portfolio as the macro outlook starts shifting.  
"
1979,PRGO,"The speed of market moves has increased substantially in the recent past, with the arrival of ETFs and algorithmic trading. You will most likely be late to the party if you wait for all the critical pieces of information to fall into place and for the new outlook to become completely clear. We will likely remain in this highly correlated state as lingering issues from 2011 continue to exert influence in the first few months of the New Year. But I expect volatility to ebb later in the year as the macro environment stabilizes, putting a premium on disciplined stock-picking abilities.  Keep an Eye on the Bond Market 
"
1980,PRGO,"As a stocks guy, I will never concede that the bond market is smarter than the stock market. But I have no hesitation in acknowledging that the bond market is a lot less sentimental and has a lot better read on the macro picture than the stock market does. Bond investors employ the classic top-down approach to investing, conditioning them to get the big-picture right in order to get rewarded. The stock market is exposed to the same macro forces, but primarily employs a bottom-up approach to investing.  
"
1981,PRGO,"Think back to last summer when the stock market was responding to developments in the debt-ceiling debate and the fear of a rating downgrade. We know how the two markets responded in their own ways to the subsequent rating downgrade. Granted, a contributing factor to the lower treasury yields is the flight-to-safety trade due to the European turmoil. But it is doubtful that bond yields would be materially higher absent that variable. Many of us argued against the unsustainability of the lower bond yields and tried to invest around that theme. It was a fruitless exercise for everyone, including Pimco's Bill Gross.   
"
1982,PRGO,"More pertinent to the New Year, take your cue about the evolving Euro-zone picture not from how the stock market is responding on a day-to-day basis, but how the yields in the government bond market are behaving. The stock market appears to have been dealing with Europe with a lot more optimism in the last few weeks than is showing up in the bond market. Don't forget that yields on 10-year Italian government bonds are still flirting with the 7% level.  Putting It All Together 
"
1983,PRGO,"The market started the New Year on a positive note, with a host of favorable domestic and international reports helping it push higher. But most of the legacy issues that weighed on stocks in the latter part of 2011 are still with us. Don't be surprised as those concerns make a comeback in the coming days. But as I explained in my market outlook two weeks ago, I expect the macro backdrop to shift at some stage in the first half of the year. You have to be ready to make that tactical switch when the time comes.   
"
1984,PRGO,"Rely more on the bond market to give you cues on the macro picture. Moving in herds is a phenomenon common to markets in all asset classes, including bonds. Nothing is infallible, but net-net, the bond market is a lot less emotional and sentimental than the stock market.  Portfolio Update  
"
1985,PRGO,"We made four changes to the Focus List this week, deleting and adding two stocks each. Both of our deletions, Moneygram International (MGI  -  Free Report) and Perrigo Company (PRGO  -  Free Report), resulted from Zacks Rank downgrades, a function of downward earnings estimation revisions.   
"
1986,PRGO,"We replaced those stocks with Spectra Energy (SE) and PS Business Parks (PSB  -  Free Report); picks that are in-line with our strategy of investing in domestic-oriented businesses with lower risk profiles. PS Business Parks is a REIT that owns and operates low-rise suburban multi-tenant offices, business parks and other assets. The company has one of the strongest balance sheets in its space and currently pays a very attractive 3.2% dividend.   
"
1987,PRGO,"Spectra Energy is a Houston-based natural gas utility that has a stable and low risk business profile. It also pays an attractive dividend, currently yielding 3.8%. 
"
1988,PRGO,"It's that time of the year again when we have to look ahead to what the New Year may have in store for us. And that is exactly my goal in today's piece  I want to share with you my outlook and the reasons behind that outlook.  
"
1989,PRGO,"The market struggled to meaningfully break out in 2011, with a host of fears in its way. These fears ranged from a recession in the U.S. to the Euro-zone imploding under the weight of its fiscal problems. Concerns about the extent of the ongoing slowdown in China have also become a recurring theme lately.   
"
1990,PRGO,"Regular readers know about my positive outlook for the U.S. economy and the market. I am looking for a much better stock market performance in the New Year than what we saw in 2011. Many of the issues that kept the market in check are still with us and will likely remain in the first half of the year. But I expect visibility to improve significantly in the second half of the year, driving most of the gains for 2012.   
"
1991,PRGO,"Recessionary worries about the U.S. economy have eased as reports started showing a pronounced improving trend in underlying data. Current expectations are for the economy to grow a little over 2% in 2012. It is hard to get excited over that level of growth. But relative to the growth prospects of the other major developed economies, the 2%-plus growth outlook for the U.S. starts looking very attractive.  Looking Ahead to 2012 
"
1992,PRGO,"The earnings recovery in the corporate sector didn't miss a beat throughout the rollercoaster ride in 2011. While we still have one more quarter to go before we close the books on 2011, when all is said and done, earnings for the S&P 500 will be up close to 17% for the year. Current expectations are for further gains of around 10% in 2012.  
"
1993,PRGO,"In addition to the typical growth deceleration at this stage of the earnings cycle, weak economic growth in Europe and China will also weigh on earnings growth in 2012. With margins effectively at peak levels and top-line gains getting hard to come by due to the relatively softer global economic backdrop, there could be some downside risk to current earnings expectations for 2012. Assuming a fairly conservative 'EPS' of $101 for the S&P 500 (below current expectations of around $105) and using a historical 'P/E' multiple of 14X, that takes you above 1400 for the index. With the S&P 500 index closing today at 1205, I am looking for gains in excess of 16% by year-end 2012.  
"
1994,PRGO,"That said, I am not looking for a nice straight up move in 2012. In fact, as I explained in today's Roundtable Review video, I envision two distinct phases in the stock market next year with each requiring its set own set of investment strategies.  Phase 1 - More of the Same
"
1995,PRGO,"In the first phase, I am looking for continuation of the current market concerns to carry over into 2012, likely lasting through the spring. During this period, the market essentially behaves the way it has over the last few months, with worries about Europe and Chinese growth as the key headwinds.  
"
1996,PRGO,"But Europe is on track towards greater fiscal union as confirmed by the recent EU agreement. I expect the coming months to bring more clarity on the next steps in that process, where the European Central Bank (ECB) becomes the lender of last resort (like the U.S. Fed) and meaningful progress gets made towards the issuance of euro-bonds. Europe still goes into recession in 2012 under the weight of the tough austerity measures put in place, but the fear of the union imploding eases.  
"
1997,PRGO,"I have a fairly sanguine view of the ongoing Chinese slowdown. I feel strongly that current fears of a hard-landing for the Chinese economy are overblown. The recent monetary easing by the Chinese central bank is confirmation that their long-running fight against inflation has been successful. A combination of fiscal and monetary easing by the Chinese authorities will ensure steady economic growth in that country. We should start seeing evidence of that by the middle of the year. Phase 2 - Increased Visibility 
"
1998,PRGO,"Increased visibility about the European and Chinese situations, roughly around the middle part of the year, help remove the clouds that had been weighing on the market in the first phase. This situation is analogous to a cyclical recovery in the stock market, with the favorable macro backdrop putting stocks on a meaningful uptrend.  
"
1999,PRGO,"Bottom line, I am not looking for much stock market momentum in the first phase, with most of the gains that I expect in 2012 coming in the second phase. It is hard, if not altogether impossible, to be overly precise in timeframes for these two phases, with my depiction above of the first phase lasting through the spring as a mere approximation. That said, I am reasonably confident by the idea of two distinct phases in the market in 2012. Risks to This Outlook 
"
2000,PRGO,"While fiscal imbalances in the U.S. economy remain long-term problems, they don't represent a danger to my 2012 outlook. Deficits and debt in the U.S. are clearly unsustainable at current levels, but what is needed is a roadmap for the future. The failure of the Congressional Super Committee has pushed this issue squarely to the 2012 elections. Overall, I don't consider U.S. fiscal imbalances as a risk factor to my investment outlook for 2011 or 2012.  
"
2001,PRGO,"The relevant risk factors to my investment outlook remain two  Europe and China. While I expect Europe to resolve its fiscal problems by continuing to strengthen its fiscal union in the coming months, the risk of inaction or miscalculation cannot be entirely ruled out.    
"
2002,PRGO,"China has assumed the role of the growth engine for the world economy. And despite their largely export-centric economy, their growth profile has been critical to the positive performance thus far of the commodity, basic materials and industrial sectors of the U.S. economy. The market has adjusted to the ongoing slowdown in the Chinese economy, but a significant slowdown will come as a negative shock.  
"
2003,PRGO,"I don't envision either of these two scenarios unfolding in 2012; both represent risk factors to my outlook. If I had to put the odds of each or both of these coming to fruition, I would put it at less than 20%. Portfolio Update 
"
2004,PRGO,"The two phases outlined above have distinct investment implications. As I explained in the 2012 Investment Strategies & Top Picks video, the first phase is not much different from what we have experienced lately in the market.  
"
2005,PRGO,"The best investment posture of this market environment is to go with quality names, relatively mid- to large-cap in size and preferably with a steadily growing dividend. Given the concerns about Europe and China, it will also help if your picks have more of a domestic focus. This phase is not particularly conducive to buy-and-hold type of investment styles, with tactical investing bringing better results. The second phase is more like investing in a cyclically upturning market, where traditional cyclical sectors like industrials, basic materials and commodities come back into favor.  
"
2006,PRGO,"Some of the best performing stocks on the Zacks Focus List have these attributes. A key attribute common among Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report), Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG  -  Free Report), and Tractor Supply Company (TSCO  -  Free Report), the top three Focus List performers at present, are their U.S. centric businesses, though each comes from a distinct industry. You can see the same trend play out in other top performing Focus List names as well, irrespective of the industry they are from. Companies in the broader healthcare sector or pharmaceutical sector, such as Humana (HUM  -  Free Report) and Perrigo (PRGO  -  Free Report), and master limited partnerships, such as ONEOK Partners (OKS) and Plains All American (PAA  -  Free Report), are primarily focused on the U.S. economy. 
"
2007,PRGO,"Perrigo Co. (PRGO  -  Free Report) recently delivered record results, which prompted upward revisions in the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The current earnings estimate of $2.59 per share is up from last week's $2.43 for the fiscal year ending June 2010. For the following year, the forecast of $2.87 climbed from $2.64 over the past week.

"
2022,PRGO,"In addition to the European debt impact, Monday's slide can also be attributed to investors moving money to the sidelines amid the recent string of down days.  
"
2023,PRGO,"The Dow lost 103.84 points, or 1% as it closed at 9,908.39. The S&P 500 dipped by 9.45 points, or 0.9%, to 1,056.74. The Nasdaq gave up 15.07 points, or 0.7%, ending the session at 2,126.05.

2029,PRGO,"Perrigo Co. (PRGO  -  Free Report) was one of top performers Monday across both model portfolios. There were no major developments fueling its 0.99% gain for the day. However, the company recently delivered record results, which prompted upward revisions in the Zacks Consensus Estimate.

"
2152,PRGO,"Over the last few weeks, I have found myself screening for stocks with the best Relative Price Changes in an effort to determine whether a stock is good or not.  
"
2153,PRGO,"Of course earnings growth and valuations are important. But if a stock is simply not responding, or worse, going down (worse than the market), something's wrong. Or at the very least, it's just simply not ready to move higher.  
"
2154,PRGO,"I've talked about this kind of stuff in the past. An investor's best stocks are the ones that are performing the best; in other words, the ones that are moving higher.  
"
2155,PRGO,"And it's the same here.  
"
2156,PRGO,"Stocks moving higher have a tendency of moving even higher.  
"
2157,PRGO,"And the stocks I've been looking at recently are indeed the ones moving higher, especially on good volume since the overall market volume has been kind of weak.  
"
2158,PRGO,"And if they are moving higher, it's likely because there's a good reason for them to be moving higher, or else they probably wouldn't be.  
"
2159,PRGO,"Of course, this doesn't mean you should only look at price change. 
"
2160,PRGO,"But, by including those kinds of things in your screening, some very interesting stocks will come up. 
"
2161,PRGO,"Some might have just missed your normal fundamental screening. But when put on your radar screen thru other measures (its price performance for example), you might find that these are just the kinds of companies you've been looking for. 
"
2162,PRGO,"Once again, you'll also notice I said relative price strength. There are periods, of course, where virtually everything is going down. So screening for absolute positive price changes will often times come up with zero results in these periods, just when you need them the most.  
"
2163,PRGO,"But also, when the market is doing nothing but going up, you want to get into the pacesetters and outperformers, not the laggards that are going up only because the rising tide is raising all the ships.  
"
2164,PRGO,"So using the relative price strength will always put the outperformers on your list in both good times and bad.  
"
2165,PRGO,"In this week's screen, I'm looking for relative price change winners that also have the fundamentals to potentially make these gains last and continue into the future.  
"
2166,PRGO,"The screen starts off with: Relative % Price change  12 weeks > 0Relative % Price change   4 weeks > 0Relative % Price change   1 week  > 0

(GM) plunging to some of the lowest levels seen in more than 60 years.

2346,PRGO,"Profit forecasts for 2009 continue to be cut in large numbers. For every positive revision , there have been 6 cuts. The ratio is roughly the same whether the sample group is the S&P 500 or the larger Zacks Rank universe, which contains about 4400 stocks.
"
2347,PRGO,"There is also quite a bit of difference in what analysts are forecasting. Last night, I calculated projected earnings growth for the S&P 500 based on the lowest, consensus and highest estimates. Here are the results based on a bottom-up calculation.
"
2348,PRGO,"Lowest estimate: $71.60 (-5.8%)
"
2349,PRGO,"Consensus estimate: $91.14 (+9.5%)
"
2350,PRGO,"Highest estimate: $111.14 (+20.7%)
"
2351,PRGO,"The bottom-up estimate is calculated by using the individual earnings estimates for each company and then applying an index-weight to it. The lowest estimate uses the lowest profit forecast for each company. The highest estimate uses the highest forecast for each company.
"
2352,PRGO,"It is possible that some of the highest forecasts are close to 90 days old, meaning that analysts have yet to adjust them for the credit crunch.
"
2353,PRGO,"The top-down forecasts, which are consensus estimates made for the S&P 500 as a whole, show a tighter range.
"
2354,PRGO,"Lowest estimate: $75.20 (+1.6%)
"
2355,PRGO,"Consensus estimate: $93.73 (+6.9%)
"
2356,PRGO,"Highest estimate: $108.00 (+7.5%)
"
2357,PRGO,"As I have said previously, these profit forecasts need to be taken with grain of salt. Brokerage analysts are doing their best to make educated guesses, but the assumptions used in their models could end up being very wrong. It's not the analysts fault, but rather just current reality.
"
2358,PRGO,"Credit Markets
"
2359,PRGO,"The credit freeze is continuing to show signs of thawing, a positive.
"
2360,PRGO,"The 3-month London-Interbank Offered Rate (aka ""LIBOR"") is down to 2.29% as of Friday morning. At the height of the credit crunch, the rate had reached 4.82%. This rate is used as the basis for many loan terms, including the interest rate on your and my credit cards.
"
2361,PRGO,"The TED Spread, which is the difference between the LIBOR rate and 3-month treasury bill rates, has also narrowed. Friday's spread of 2% is well below the recent peak of 3.66%.
"
2362,PRGO,"Higher TED spreads imply greater credit risk. Prior to the current credit crunch, the TED spread was 0.11%.
"
2363,PRGO,"The Election and the Our Portfolios
"
2364,PRGO,"During the campaign, President-Elect Obama said that healthcare will be one his top priorities. Since the Focus List presently has a heavy weighting towards the medical sector, I want to address why I'm not concerned.
"
2365,PRGO,"Healthcare will be a major battle. There are too many players with high-powered lobbyists to allow true change to occur without a fight.
"
2366,PRGO,"Furthermore, even if the U.S. moves towards national health care, much of the existing system could be kept in place. Switzerland has universal coverage AND powerful insurance and pharmaceutical companies.
"
2367,PRGO,"In other words, I expect most companies within the medical sector to remain profitable long after President-Elect Obama leaves the White House. This said, we will monitor progress and make changes to the portfolio if legislation dictates it.
"
2368,PRGO,"The Markets
"
2369,PRGO,"Despite all of the volatility, we are still in one big trading range. The post-election pullback occured as the Dow was just above resistance and overbought on a short-term basis.
"
2370,PRGO,"There was a big rally headed into the election, so a sell on the news reaction was not surprising.
"
2371,PRGO,"In a monthly column that I write for SFO Magazine's web site, I described the Dow's range as between 8200-9450. We might see some intraday swings slightly outside these numbers, but I think it's a close approximation.
"
2372,PRGO,"Though this is a big range, if the Dow can start to see more days with double-digit moves, as opposed to triple-digit moves, then investor confidence would be more fully restored.
"
2373,PRGO,"Here's the weekly chart of the S&P 500. Nothing much has changed from last week.
"
2374,PRGO,"Volatility remains exceptionally high, even with the VIX off of its record highs.
"
2375,PRGO,"The Focus List
"
2376,PRGO,"We did not make any changes this week, but there are a few companies we are looking at closely. Our target is adding 2-3 companies per week.
"
2377,PRGO,"Perrigo's (PRGO  -  Free Report) earnings were a penny below expectations, but guidance seemed to be okay. We're looking at the estimate revisions as they come out.
"
2378,PRGO,"McDonald's (MCD  -  Free Report) said the stronger dollar could hurt fourth-quarter earnings. I do think the company will benefit from more frugal consumers in the U.S., however. We're going to monitor the estimates revisions.

2628,PRGO,"So all that being said, I decided to put together a screen that looks for companies with solid cash positions.
"
2629,PRGO,"Let me note that I'm not doing this in hopes that these companies initiate repurchase programs of their own, even though that could be a benefit.

"
2713,PRGO,"Wall Streets bearish action is putting a strain on some of the Focus List holdings, leading us to execute a deletion on Flowserve (FLS). The company is being removed from both the Focus List and the Timely Buys list. Earnings estimates for 2009 were recently cut. More importantly, the stock's performance has not been good and we want to contain the current loss.
"
2714,PRGO,"The current environment has also triggered a removal of Nucor (NUE  -  Free Report) from our Growth and Income portfolio. The companys stock has been hit hard in the commodities sell-off. We are deleting NUE to contain our losses. Fundamentals remain in place as 2008 estimates continue to rise with 5 out of 12 analysts raising estimates in the last week.

We continue to invest in research and development, building our pipeline for future innovation as well.""
"
2726,PRGO,"Favorable Comparisons
"
2727,PRGO,"Perrigos return on equity (ROE) of 18% more than doubles the industry average of 7%. The companys net profit margin of 7.5% is ahead of the industrys 1.4%. Earnings per share are expected to grow by 20% over the next 3  5 years, outpacing the industry average of 15%. 
"
2728,PRGO," Yield Also Beats the Industry
"
2729,PRGO,"PRGOs annual income of 20 cents per share translates into a dividend yield of 0.6%, which tops the industry average as virtually none of the companies within the industry pay dividends.
"
2730,PRGO,"We are seeing two markets at work right now: one that is surprisingly bullish and another that is currently bearish. I'll start with the bearish market first and then give you reason for optimism.
"
2731,PRGO,"The fundamental backdrop continues to deteriorate. Business inventories are on the rise. Companies are shedding jobs. Oil is so high that it could fall 20% and still trade near $90 per barrel. Food prices are causing UN peacekeepers to protect the Haitian presidential palace from rioters, Egypt to use the military to bake bread and Thailand to use soldiers to guard grains.
"
2732,PRGO,"Aggregate growth for the first-quarter could be negative.
"
2733,PRGO,"Then there is the credit crunch, which General Electric (GE  -  Free Report) blamed for its poor earnings this morning. If businesses can't borrow, they'll spend less.
"
2734,PRGO,"They'll also engage in fewer mergers, which hurts stocks. Keep in mind that the interest in Yahoo (YHOO) is coming from cash rich companies. Other mergers are occurring, but there are also many deals that aren't getting done. Lenders don't trust borrowers, which remains a big problem.
"
2735,PRGO,"The housing crisis is worsening. Despite all of the calls for lenders to work with homebuyers, credit standards remain tight. Furthermore, there are many people who bought more house than they could afford. Add in rising unemployment levels and a near-term recovery in the housing market just doesn't seem likely.
"
2736,PRGO,"Then there are the banks. 2009 earnings estimates for multiple large banks are being cut. (No, that's not a typo - estimates for next year are being slashed. Plunging would be a good way to describe expected bank earnings for this year.)
"
2737,PRGO,"Many market observers, including myself, anticipated the economy would slump in the first-quarter, so the bad news is not a real surprise (even if it is worse than some might have thought). The big question is when will the recovery start? The equity markets are betting the recovery will occur sooner than later.
"
2738,PRGO,"Take a look at the chart below. Despite all of the hoopin' and hollerin'
"
2739,PRGO,"about the daily volatility, the major indexes are essentially at the same level they were in mid-January.
"
2740,PRGO,"Overshadowed by this big trading range is the fact that many stocks are trading at or near their 52-week highs, including Focus List members CF Industries (CF  -  Free Report) and Perrigo (PRGO  -  Free Report).
"
2741,PRGO,"Could the bulls be wrong? It's a possibility. (In the case of the financial sector, I think they are really, really wrong.) On the other hand, if the bulls are right and the economy does recover in the second half, the equity markets are not going to give any advanced notice to those who put all of their money in cash that an upside breakout going to occur.
"
2742,PRGO,"At the very least, the markets are holding up much better than they should given the current backdrop - and this alone is reason to be optimistic.
"
2743,PRGO,"I don't think we are out of the woods yet, but I do think that now is not the right time for investors to be out of the market. Rather, investors need to remain smart and keep looking for opportunities. That is what we're doing with the Focus List, and we beat the performance of the S&P 500 last month as a result.
"
2744,PRGO,"Remember, investing is a process. Not every stock you buy will make you money, but when smart decisions are made, over time, the return of the winners will far offset any losses.
"
2745,PRGO,"Focus List UpdatesInternational Business Machines (IBM) was added last week. Big Blue has transformed itself, shedding lower margin businesses and focusing more on enterprise products and services. In addition, the company's customer base is geographically diversified, which helps to protect it from the current economic slump in the U.S. I recently spoke about IBM in my Bull and Bear of the Week feature with Chuck Jaffe of MarketWatch.

(HEES  -  Free Report) and The Perrigo Company (PRGO  -  Free Report).China Security & Surveillance Technology, Inc. (CSR) was a top performer last week as shares improved by approximately 10.2%.

2749,PRGO,"In November, the company reported third-quarter results, which included revenue that increased 50.6% year over year to $65.4 million. In addition, earnings per share matched the consensus. CSR secured 49 new contracts during the quarter. China Security and Surveillance is excited about its opportunities in the security services market, as demand for its products and services continue to be strong. The company expects revenues between $80 million and $85 million for the fourth quarter and $350 million to $370 million for 2008. Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. (TTWO  -  Free Report) spent a second consecutive week on the top performers list as shares gained approximately 8.5%. Last week, shares of the video game company advanced almost 14%. Analysts are expecting big things from the upcoming release of Grand Theft Auto IV, scheduled for early 2008. Anticipation for the latest release in this popular series has led to some brokerage upgrades for TTWO. Take-Two is also benefiting from favorable trends in its industry. Video game sales in November were strong, suggesting that this space may be a bright spot in an otherwise lackluster holiday selling season.  
"
2750,PRGO,"Take-Two Interactive is scheduled to report its fiscal fourth quarter results after the bell on Dec 18. Earnings estimates for the year ending October 2008 have been trending higher for several months, including a gain of 6.5% in the past seven trading days. First Solar, Inc. (FSLR  -  Free Report) is a manufacturer of solar modules, which means this Zacks #1 Rank is in a growth industry with lots of potential for the future. Earnings estimates for this year surged 100% over the past two months, including a gain of 5% in the past week. Expectations for next year are up 43% in two months and 4% in seven days. Shares of the company gained 6.9% for the week ended Dec 14.

2761,PRGO,"During the course of their financial planning and execution, while value investors miss the chance of betting on stocks that have bright long-term prospects, growth investors often end up investing in expensive stocks.Consequently, the quest for a mixed investment strategy led to the introduction of the GARP (growth at a reasonable price) approach. What GARPers look for is whether the stocks are somewhat undervalued and have solid sustainable growth potential (Investopedia).The price/earnings growth (PEG) ratio is a perfect example of a GARP strategy. Although it is categorized under value investing, this strategy follows the principles of both growth and value investing.The PEG ratio is defined as: (Price/ Earnings)/Earnings Growth RateIt relates the stocks P/E ratio with future earnings growth rate.While P/E alone only gives the idea of stocks, which are trading at a discount, PEG, while adding the GROWTH element to it, helps to find those stocks that have solid future potential.A lower PEG ratio, preferably less than 1, is always better for GARP investors.Say for example, if a stock's P/E ratio is 10 and expected long-term growth rate is 15%, the company's PEG will come down to 0.66, a ratio which indicates both undervaluation and future growth potential.Unfortunately, this ratio is often neglected due to investors' limitation to calculate the future earnings growth rate of a stock.There are some drawbacks to using the PEG ratio though. It doesn't consider the very common situation of changing growth rates such as the forecast of the first three years at very high growth rate followed by a sustainable but lower growth rate in the long term.Hence, PEG-based investing can turn out to be even more rewarding if some other relevant parameters are also taken into consideration.Here are the screening criteria for a winning strategy:PEG Ratio less than X Industry MedianP/E Ratio (using F1) less than X Industry Median (For more accurate valuation purpose.)Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) (Whether good market conditions or bad, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1  or #2 have a proven history of success.)Market Capitalization greater than $1 Billion (This helps us to focus on companies that have strong liquidity.)Average 20 Day Volume greater than 50,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Percentage Change F1 Earnings Estimate Revisions (4 Weeks) greater than 5%: Upward estimate revisions add to the optimism, suggesting further bullishness.Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 (Hold) offer the best upside potential. Here are five of the 19 stocks that qualified the screening:Perrigo Company plc (PRGO  -  Free Report): The company develops, manufactures, markets, and distributes over-the-counter (OTC) consumer goods and pharmaceutical products worldwide. Apart from a Zacks Rank #2 and a Value Score of B, the stock also has an impressive long-term expected growth rate of 9.6%.DXC Technology Company (DXC  -  Free Report): This is an independent, end-to-end IT services company, primarily providing information technology services and solutions in North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia.

2762,PRGO,"In the course of strict screening to determine the intrinsic value of a company, investors often miss the chance of betting on stocks that have bright long-term prospects. The same way, growth investors often end up investing in expensive stocks.If we keenly observe the investment track of the Oracle of Omaha, we can see how, in quest of eliminating these hazards, this pure play value investor has gradually shifted to a mixed  investment strategy or more precisely GARP (growth at a reasonable price) strategy.This strategy combines both growth and value investing principles and has a proven track record of success. What GARPers look for is whether the stocks are somewhat undervalued and have solid sustainable growth potential (Investopedia).Here lies the importance of a not-so-popular fundamental metric, the price/earnings growth (PEG) ratio. Although it is categorized under value investing, this strategy follows the principles of both growth and value investing.The PEG ratio is defined as: (Price/ Earnings)/Earnings Growth RateIt relates the stocks P/E ratio with future earnings growth rate.While P/E alone only gives the idea of stocks, which are trading at a discount, PEG while adding the GROWTH element to it, helps to find those stocks that have solid future potential.A lower PEG ratio, preferably less than 1, is always better for GARP investors.Say for example, if a stock’s P/E ratio is 10 and expected long-term growth rate is 15%, the company’s PEG will come down to 0.66, a ratio which indicates both undervaluation and future growth potential.Unfortunately, this ratio is often neglected due to investors’ limitation to calculate the future earnings growth rate of a stock.There are some drawbacks to using the PEG ratio though. It doesn’t consider the very common situation of changing growth rates such as the forecast of the first three years at very high growth rates followed by a sustainable but lower growth rate in the long term.Hence, PEG-based investing can turn out to be even more rewarding if some other relevant parameters are also taken into consideration.Here are the screening criteria for a winning strategy:PEG Ratio less than X Industry MedianP/E Ratio (using F1) less than X Industry Median (For more accurate valuation purpose.)Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) (Whether good market conditions or bad, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1  or #2 have a proven history of success.)Market Capitalization greater than $1 Billion (This helps us to focus on companies that have strong liquidity.)Average 20 Day Volume greater than 50,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Percentage Change F1 Earnings Estimate Revisions (4 Weeks) greater than 5%: Upward estimate revisions add to the optimism, suggesting further bullishness.Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 (Hold) offer the best upside potential. Here are five of the 33 stocks that qualified the screening:Boot Barn Holdings, Inc. (BOOT  -  Free Report) – This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company is a lifestyle retail chain and operates specialty retail stores in the United States. Boot Barn Holdings can be an impressive value investment pick with its Value Style Score of B. The company’s long-term expected earnings growth rate is projected to be 15.7%.Perrigo Company plc (PRGO  -  Free Report): The company develops, manufactures, markets, and distributes over-the-counter (OTC) consumer goods and pharmaceutical products worldwide. Apart from a Zacks Rank #2 and a Value Style Score of B, the stock also has an impressive long-term expected growth rate of 9.6%.Boise Cascade Company (BCC  -  Free Report): This is one of the largest producers of engineered wood products and plywood in North America and a leading U.S. wholesale distributor of building products. The stock has an impressive long-term expected growth rate of 18.5%. The stock currently has a Value Score of A and a Zacks Rank #1.

2765,PRGO,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Perrigo Company plc (PRGO  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 4.7% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is PRGO due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Perrigo Surpassed Earnings in Q4, Revenues Down Y/YPerrigo Company reported fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of $1.28 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.24 by 3.2%. The bottom line also increased 3.2% from the year-ago figure.Net sales in the reported quarter declined 3.6% to $1.28 billion as divestitures of some businesses hurt the top line. But the metric surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.25 billion. Moreover, excluding the impact of divestitures, sales nudged up 2.1% year over year.Segment DiscussionCHCA:  CHCA net sales in the fourth quarter of 2017 came in at $644 million, up 2.7% year over year. This upside can be attributed to a strong performance from the gastrointestinal and analgesics categories compared with the year-ago quarter. New product sales of $17 million also contributed to the top line, led by the store brand version of Nexium, launched last September, and smoking cessation products.However, this upside was partially offset by lower sales from nutritional drink products in the infant nutrition category as well as pricing pressure in certain OTC (over the counter) categories.CHCI:CHCI segment reported net sales of $374 million, down 10.8% (declined 16.9% on a constant-currency basis) from the year-ago period. Excluding contributions from the divested European distribution businesses and favorable currency movements, organic net sales increased approximately 3.3% owing to higher sales of new products.The company also witnessed higher new product sales in the personal care category as well as the store brand business in the U.K. However, this was partially offset by lower net sales in the anti-parasite category.Prescription Pharmaceuticals (RX):  The Prescription Pharmaceuticals segment net sales slipped 1.7% to $261 million on a reported basis and 1.8% on a constant-currency basis. This sales dip can be attributed to lower sales of Entocort due to competitive pressures and price erosion.2017 ResultsFull-year sales decreased 6.3% year over year to $4.9 billion. The metric was however, in line with both the Zacks Consensus Estimate and preliminary results.The 2017 earnings per share of $4.93 were slightly higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.89 but declined 2.8% compared with the year-ago figure.2018 Earnings Outlook Perrigo expects revenues in the range of $5.0-$5.1 billion in 2018, above 2017 revenues of 4.9 billion.The company projects earnings in the band of $5.05-$5.45 per share, also ahead of the full-year adjusted earnings of $4.93.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. There have been eight revisions lower for the current quarter. In the past month, the consensus estimate has shifted by 6.2% due to these changes.Perrigo Company plc Price and Consensus Perrigo Company plc Price and Consensus | Perrigo Company plc QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, PRGO has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a lot on the momentum front with an F. However, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the second quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Zacks' style scores indicate that the company's stock is suitable for value and growth investors.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, PRGO has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.

2766,PRGO,"Healthy rise in healthcare shares helped the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq finish in the positive territory on Friday. Such shares rose as they aren’t affected by Trump tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. However, such tariffs did have a negative impact on the overall investor sentiment that led all the three major indexes post a weekly loss for the first time in three weeks. Tariffs on steel and aluminum imports could hurt corporations as well as consumers, while it also stirred fears of a trade dispute between the United States and China.How the Benchmarks Fared?The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) decreased 0.3%, or 71.68 points, to close at 24,538.06. The S&P 500 gained 0.5% to close at 2,691.25. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 7,257.87, increasing 1.1%. The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), Wall Street’s so-called fear gauge came in at 19.59, way higher than a reading near 11 for most of 2017. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,416 to 1,390. On the Nasdaq, 1,865 issues rose and 993 fell.Healthcare Shares RiseSharp rise in healthcare shares, somewhat, helped the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq finish in the green. After all, they are least affected from Trump’s tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum.The Health Care Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLV) was the best performing sector among the S&P 500 sectors, gaining 1%. Individually, Perrigo Company plc (PRGO  -  Free Report) was among the best performers in the index, increasing 4.3%. The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (IBB  -  Free Report) also advanced 2.4%.Trump Tariffs Drag Markets Down for the WeekThe major bourses, however, ended in the red for the week. The Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq declined 3.1%, 2% and 1.1%, respectively. Trump’s tariffs declaration on steel and aluminum imports prompted a steep stock market sell-off.Trump said that the U.S. will impose a 25% tariff on steel imports and a 10% tariff on aluminum. Such a protectionist trade policy triggered a lot of concern among corporations and consumers. Tariffs will increase the cost of companies that rely heavily on aluminum and steel, like auto and plane makers. In fact, Corporate America has cautioned Trump that tariffs could backfire. After all, imports make up for about a third of the steel American business houses use every year.Higher prices on steel and aluminum, furthermore, will compel companies that rely on such products to pass on some of the costs to consumers. Increased consumer prices may in the long run hamper sales growth and affect the company, leading to job losses.Trump’s contentious tariff announcement has raised apprehensions about retaliation from China and other major U.S. trading partners. China has cautioned America to abide by multilateral trade rules and not to harm the delicate global economy. We shouldn’t forget that China is the world’s dominant steel producer and Trump’s tariff moves could easily start a trade war between them.Trump’s tariff announcements has already received angry responses from global leaders, with the European Union saying that they will impose tariffs on $3.5 billion worth of U.S. imports, as per Reuters.Stocks That Made HeadlineLiberty Interactive Q4 Earnings & Sales Top EstimatesLiberty Interactive Corp.  delivered impressive fourth-quarter 2017 results, with the bottom and top line surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate.

2768,PRGO,"Shares of Perrigo Company plc (PRGO  -  Free Report) hit a new 52-week high of $92.16 on Jan 11, just a few days after the company announced the appointment of its new chief executive officer (CEO), Uwe Rohrhoff. The stock eventually closed at $91.99.Perrigo’s shares underperformed the industry in 2017. While the stock gained 17.7%, the broader industry rallied 23.7%. However, the company has recovered in 2018 and is already up 5.5%.On Jan 8, the company ended its search for a new CEO by appointing Uwe Rohrhoff, effective Jan 15. The new CEO will succeed John T. Hendrickson, who had announced his retirement plan in June 2017. John T. Hendrickson will resign as CEO and a board member on Jan 15 but will continue to remain with the company until Mar 15 to ensure a smooth and successful transition.Uwe Rohrhoff brings with him a strong record in operations and global leadership positions. He also has a proven track record of driving growth and profitability, besides managing a complex operating platform in global healthcare markets.Currently, Perrigois facing a challenging pricing environment in the Rx segment due to industry and competitive pressures in the generics sector that is hurting the company’s top line. The U.S. Department of Justice Antitrust Division has also been conducting an investigation at Perrigo seeking information about its drug pricing practices.Meanwhile, the Branded Consumer Healthcare (BCH) segment continues to be impacted by market dynamics due to softness in certain leading brand categories primarily owing to lower sell-through during 2016 as a result of re-staging the launch timing of certain products, changes in timing of certain advertising and promotional campaigns.However, the company is making efforts to overcome these challenges. In March 2017, Perrigo divested its Tysabri royalty stream in order to monetize the asset. Further, in November, the company also divested its Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) business to SK Capital for $110 million in order to focus on its core business.In February 2017, the company adopted a cost optimization strategy to slash workforce approximately 14% from its global non-production staff. This workforce reduction is expected to generate annual savings worth $130 million by mid-2018.Supported by these efforts, Perrigo raised its earnings outlook for 2017 on the third quarter 2017 earnings call as it sees continued positive execution across all the business segments.It now remains to be seen, how the new CEO will continue to guide the company through the challenges it has been facing over the past couple of years.Perrigo Company Price  Perrigo Company Price | Perrigo Company QuoteZacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderPerrigo has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2769,PRGO,"Second quarter earnings season is drawing to a close with most major companies having reported results. This week, companies like Endo, Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report), Novo Nordisk and Perrigo (PRGO  -  Free Report) presented their second quarter results.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesA Look at Q2 Earnings Results: Mylan’s second quarter results were disappointing with the company missing on both earnings and revenues and cutting its outlook (Also read: Mylan Misses on Q2 Earnings & Sales, Lowers View). Mylan has pushed back all major product launches in the U.S. from 2017 to 2018 reflecting ongoing challenges and the uncertain U.S. regulatory environment. These product launches include generic versions of Advair and Copaxone. Escalating price erosion in the generics market remains a major challenge. Meanwhile, Mylan got a subpoena from the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) in late Jul 2017 seeking information relating to opioids manufactured, marketed or sold by the company from Jan 1, 2013 to Dec 31, 2016. Mylan has lost 15.4% of its value year to date versus the 15.8% decline of its industry.Perrigo’s second quarter results were better-than-expected with the company raising its outlook (Also read: Perrigo Q2 Earnings & Sales Top, 2017 View Raised). Novo Nordisk also topped earnings estimates and raised its outlook. Meanwhile, Endo, which topped earnings and revenue estimates, lowered its outlook (Also read: Endo Beats Q2 Earnings & Sales, 2017 Guidance Lowered). Endo stock has lost 54.2% of its value year to date versus the 1.8% decline of its industry.Perrigo is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.

The mid-stage triplet oral therapy study met its primary endpoint of greater LDL-C lowering compared to placebo. The company intends to conduct additional studies next year and expects to file for FDA approval of the combination by the first quarter of 2019.Zynerba Plunges as STAR 1 Fails to Shine: Zynerba  saw its shares plunging 55.7% on disappointing mid-stage data on the company’s experimental cannabinoid treatment, ZYN002. Results from the double-blind placebo controlled STAR 1 study in adult epilepsy patients with focal seizures showed that both doses of ZYN002 failed to meet the endpoints compared to placebo. Focus has now shifted to a couple more studies being conducted with ZYN002 – osteoarthritis (top-line data expected in Aug 2017) and Fragile X syndrome (top-line data expected in Sep 2017).  Valeant Gets CRL for Eye Drop: Valeant (VRX  -  Free Report), which reported second quarter results this week (Also read: Valeant Beats Q2 Earnings, Sales in Line, Trims View), got a complete response letter (“CRL”) from the FDA for its new drug application (“NDA”) for Vyzulta (latanoprostene bunod ophthalmic solution, 0.024%). The company is looking to gain approval for the use of the intraocular pressure lowering single-agent eye drop in patients with open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. While no safety or efficacy concerns were raised by the FDA, the CRL referred to a Current Good Manufacturing Practice (“CGMP”) inspection at Bausch + Lomb's manufacturing facility in Tampa, FL. Valeant is working on resolving manufacturing quality issues at the Tampa plant and will be working with the agency to determine the path forward.PerformanceLarge Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % Return Large Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % ReturnThe NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index declined 1.9% over the last five trading sessions.

2770,PRGO,"Perrigo Company plc (PRGO  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter 2017 earnings of $1.22 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 95 cents per share by 28.4%. However, adjusted earnings declined 5.4% from the year-ago figure.The company, however, reported loss of 49 cents per share for the same period, including amortization and restructuring charges and other one-time items. This figure narrowed 87% year over year.Net sales in the reported quarter declined 8% to $1.24 billion as divestures of some businesses and currency headwinds hurt the top line. But revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.18 billion.Excluding the impact of currency and divestures, sales improved on the back of positive execution across all business segments.Shares of Perrigo have rallied more than 12% in pre-market hours. However, the company’s shares have significantly underperformed the industry so far this year. The stock has lost 8.3% compared with the broader industry’s gain of 17.8%.Segment DiscussionIn January, Perrigo announced to having changed its reporting segments following the sale of the Tysabri royalty stream earlier in March this year. Effective from Jan 1, 2017, the company’s new reporting segments are: Consumer Health Care Americas (CHCA), Consumer Health Care International (CHCI), Prescription Pharmaceuticals (RX) and Other Segment.CHCA: CHCA net sales in the second quarter of 2017 came in at $605 million, down 4% due to sale of the vitamins, minerals and supplements (VMS) business in Jun 2016, which had contributed to segmental sales in the prior year.The company reported higher new product sales in the quarter, driven by continued strong net sales of the store brand version of Flonase. However, these were offset by lower sales of animal health, analgesics and cough and cold categories.CHCI: CHCI segment reported net sales of $377 million, down 9% (declined 6% on a constant-currency basis) from the year-ago period. Excluding year-over-year contributions from the divested European distribution businesses and currency headwinds, organic net sales increased approximately 4% due to higher sales of new products.Net sales of existing products also rose primarily on higher sales in the allergy, analgesic plus cough and cold categories.Prescription Pharmaceuticals (RX): The Prescription Pharmaceuticals segment also showed a sluggish performance during the quarter, with net sales declining 13% to $267 million, both on a reported and constant-currency basis. This dip in sales can be attributed to lower sales of Entocort, due to competitive pressures and price erosion. However, the lower sales were partially offset by higher sales of existing and new products.Other UpdatesDuring the quarter, the company announced that it has reached an agreement to divest its Israel Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) business for an amount of $110 million in cash. The company had been looking for strategic alternatives for the API unit since February this year.2017 Earnings Outlook UpdatedPerrigo increased its earnings outlook for 2017 due to the sale of the API business and a continued positive execution across all business segments.

2772,PRGO,"We expect Perrigo Company plc (PRGO  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports third-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Nov 9.Perrigo has an average positive surprise of 13.13%. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive surprise of 28.42%.Perrigo’s shares have lost 2.1% so far this year against the industry’s rally of 19.8%.Let’s see, how things are shaping up at the company this quarter.Factors Influencing This QuarterPerrigo’s product acquisitions and new product launches in the Prescription Pharmaceuticals (Rx) segment are expected to boost sales in the coming quarters. In September, Perrigo announced that it has initiated shipments of the first-to-market over-the-counter store brand equivalent of Nexium capsules to retail customers which is indicated to treat frequent heartburn. During the same month, the company also announced FDA approvals for generic version of Exalgo for management of moderate to severe pain in opioid tolerant patients and the generic version of Acanya for topical treatment of acne vulgaris. These launches and approvals are expected to contribute to the top line in the coming quarters.Also, the ongoing restructuring initiatives and operating expense discipline are expected to support the bottom line.However, price erosion and changing market dynamics amid a tough drug pricing environment across Perrigo’s Rx segment is likely to continue hurting the segment’s performance. It anticipates price erosion of approximately 9-11% at the Rx segment in the coming quarters.The Branded Consumer Healthcare (“BCH”) business, part of Consumer Health Care International (“CHCI”) segment, is still being impacted by unfavorable market dynamics in countries like Belgium, France, Germany and Italy. This BCH segment is projected to underperform in the yet-to-be-reported quarter due to lower-than-expected revenues from certain high-margin products.Earnings WhispersOur proven model shows that Perrigo is likely to beat on earnings because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.Zacks ESP: Perrigo has an Earnings ESP of +2.53%, indicating a likely positive earnings surprise.

2773,PRGO,"The political gridlock over the pullback of the Affordable Care Act or Obamacare has been making headlines in the MedTech space. The MedTech space received a sudden jolt recently when White House pulled the plug on Obamacare subsidies that reduce health care costs for Americans with low incomes.There are concerns that the final ‘Trump-care plan’ will still include the MedTech tax repeal in its agenda. Meanwhile, the old template of the plan, which promised to eradicate the infamous 2.3% medical device tax and the Cadillac tax (40% excise tax on high-cost healthcare plans) was not a bad deal. Amid such uproar, the question that emerges is will medical product players gain or lose.Q3 PerformanceNotably, 33 members of the total S&P 500 companies in the broader Medical sector have released their third-quarter results. The full picture is revealed in the latest Earnings Preview which suggests that stocks in the much sought-after S&P 500 Index will witness 2.3% bottom-line expansion in this reporting cycle.Notably, there are some powerful long-term tailwinds in the medical space, including mergers & acquisitions (M&A), emerging market expansion, positive demographic trends and new product innovation. These have been a major driving force behind the sector’s impressive performance over the past few quarters even amid severe socio-economic and political instabilities.
