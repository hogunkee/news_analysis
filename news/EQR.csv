12,EQR,"2016 has been a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde year for real estate investment trusts. A pleasant first half of the year turned into a nasty second half as interest rate jitters fueled selling in the sector.Starting in late July, IBD's property REIT group, long known as a safe-haven play, pulled back nearly 16%, putting the sector pretty much in bear-market territory.
"
13,EQR,"But don't give up on REITs just yet. The group, known for the stocks' hefty dividend yields, has bounced up 8% from its Nov. 11 low, and analysts and fund managers point toward an improving economy as a catalyst in coming quarters.
"
14,EQR,"An individual investor might ask: Why would I want to invest in REITs to generate income in a higher interest-rate environment?
"
15,EQR,"It's a valid question because higher interest rates raise debt-financing costs, and REITs are known for carrying debt due to their acquisitive nature.
"
16,EQR,"Special Report: Dividend And Income Investing
"
17,EQR,"Ask investment professionals the question and you get this answer: REITs can do quite well in a rising interest rate environment, so long as rates are going up as a result of a strengthening economy. That seems to be the case now.
"
18,EQR,"Edward Mui, a Morningstar equity research analyst specializing in REITs, still likes the fundamental outlook for REITs, particularly in areas like health care properties, shopping centers and apartments.
"
19,EQR,"According to Mui, senior housing REITs still have an aging population working in their favor, and a shift toward private pay sources insulates them from potential changes to the Affordable Care Act as a result of Donald Trump's presidential win. He follows names like HCP Inc. (HCP), Welltower (HCN) and Ventas (VTR). All three boast annualized dividend yields of around 5%. They're all more than 20% off recent 52-week highs.

22,EQR,"In the apartment space, Mui follows Equity Residential (EQR) and AvalonBay (AVB). Both REITs have big presences in coastal and gateway cities like Boston, New York, Seattle, San Francisco and Southern California. Equity Residential has a more urban focus. AvalonBay is more known for its suburban developments.

24,EQR,"John Snowden has a third of Resource Real Estate Diversifed Income Fund in REITS.
"
25,EQR,"John Snowden, portfolio manager at Resource Real Estate Diversified Income Fund (RREDX), has a third of his fund invested in REITs, another third in real estate credit and the final third in real estate private equity. The fund's objective is to provide a 6% annual return to shareholders with more modest capital appreciation of 2-3%.
"
26,EQR,"Snowden's fund is an interval fund with around $200 million under management. Interval funds have been around for four to five years and have been growing in popularity due to low volatility. Rather than provide daily liquidity like a normal mutual fund, the fund offers quarterly liquidity.
"
27,EQR,"""By giving up a little liquidity, we're able to invest more in the private markets where we can generate excess returns because of longer time horizons and less volatility,"" said Snowden.
"
28,EQR,"Snowden attended the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts's REITWorld conference last month in Arizona. He says the general consensus among management he talked to was that business is still strong and the outlook over the next 12 months is positive.
"
29,EQR,"At the end of the third quarter, Snowden's top-weighted REIT holdings included Communications Sales & Leasing (CSAL), Blackstone Mortgage Trust (BXMT) and New Residential Investment (NRZ). The latter two offer big yields of 8% and 12%, respectively. But keep in mind that such lofty yields generally come with higher risk.
"
30,EQR,"Calvin Schnure expects to see continued fundamental strength in the REIT sector.
"
31,EQR,"Calvin Schnure, senior vice president of research and economic analysis at NAREIT, noted that the current situation for REITs is similar to 2004 when the Fed embarked on a series of rate hikes. Rates had been low for a long period of time, inflation was contained and the Fed was ready to normalize rates. REITs initially weakened but eventually outperformed the S&P 500 in double-digit terms over the subsequent two to three years of rate hikes by the Fed.
"
32,EQR,"As for REITs' ability to outperform in 2017, Schnure noted that while there's some uncertainty about how President-elect Trump's policies will unfold, it shouldn't affect underlying strong fundamentals in the sector.
"
33,EQR,"""The commercial real estate expansion cycle should continue for some time, there are no signs of overbuilding and the U.S. economy doesn't look vulnerable. All the ingredients are in place for a good year ahead,"" he said.
"
34,EQR,"Schnure also points toward reasonable valuations in the REIT sector. ""The price-to-FFO ratio is in the lower half of what the range has been for the past half-decade. This is not an overvalued sector at all,"" he said.
"
35,EQR,"Schnure also pointed out a recent NAREIT-sponsored study by Wilshire Associates regarding income-oriented retirement planning. Research from Wilshire Funds Management based on portfolio optimizations using 40 years of investment return data through 2015 showed that adding high income-generating assets like REITs to a traditional retirement portfolio could boost income returns by nearly 40%, while providing similar total returns and no increase in risk.
"
36,EQR,"IBD'S TAKE:
"
37,EQR,"Many property REITs in IBD's database are trying to put in a bottom after modest pullbacks, but others are showing resilience and holding near highs, with compelling charts.
"
38,EQR,"Savvy income investors should look for renewed signs of accumulation, or institutional buying, in the group. During the week ended Nov. 11, the group reversed higher, rising 1%. Volume was heavy, and it closed in the upper half of its  weekly range. That was a sign of support from institutional buyers. The group still has some potential resistance (selling pressure) to work through, so more weekly price gains on above-average volume would help the group's cause.
"
39,EQR,"Here's a look at two REITs in healthy technical setups at the moment:

45,EQR,"Real estate investment trusts were big winners for much of the year, as investors sought out juicy payouts in a world of low or even negative interest rates. But with bond yields rising amid growing expectations of a Federal Reserve rate hike, property REITs such as Store Capital (STOR) and Simon Property Group (SPG) are selling off.REITs get special tax treatment as long as they pass on nearly all earnings to investors. Many pay attractive yields and in the low-interest world they've also delivered significant share price appreciation. But the stocks peaked a few months ago, with many REIT stocks breaking their 50-day moving averages or their 200-day lines in recent days.IBD'S TAKE: Fed rate hike talk is sinking REITs and utilities, but it's giving a boost to financials. See which big bank stocks have joined JPMorgan Chase in a buy zone this week.Store Capital is the only property REIT in the IBD 50. Store — an acronym for Single Tenant Operational Real Estate — focuses on single-occupant commercial real estate. Earnings growth has been strong, with a 4.1% dividend yield.But shares fell below the 50-day moving average last week. Store Capital sank 3.75% to close at 27.49 on the stock market today, hitting the lowest levels since late June.Simon Property Group owns many malls. That's a tough business with many retailers slashing stores in the face of competition from Amazon (AMZN).Simon Property fell below its 50-day moving average in early August, and found resistance at that line over the next several weeks. Recently shares have crumbled, tumbling through the 200-day line on Monday. Shares closed down 1.6% at 195.72, and are off 5.5%% so far this week.Crown Castle (CCI) and American Tower (AMT) are both REITs that own cellphone towers used by telecoms.Crown Castle has been trading below its 50-day line since early August, with a couple of exceptions. Shares fell 2% Wednesday, through its 200-day line. Crown Castle hasn't closed below that key level since early February.American Tower plunged below its 50-day on Sept. 9. It tried to retake that line on Friday but reversed lower. Shares have plunged 5% so far this week to a 3-month low, including 2.9% on Wednesday, heading for the 200-day line.Public Storage (PSA) owns self-storage facilities across the country. Shares peaked in April, then decisively undercut the 50-day and 200-day lines in late July. Public Storage has continued to fall. Shares slid 1.8% Wednesday afternoon, hitting a 52-week low.RELATED:Real Estate Is Newest S&P Sector

47,EQR,"Developers Steven Shores and Marc Pollack found a way to stand out from the crowd rushing to build apartments in Atlanta's ritziest neighborhood: They're putting their 315-unit project in Buckhead on hold.""We found ourselves wondering if it makes sense now to move forward on a project when four or five others are on the exact same schedule,"" said Shores, whose company, Pollack Shores Real Estate Group, will wait a year, then reassess its plan for the luxury building. ""We are in it for the long term. There's no reason we can't hold off temporarily.""Apartment developers are starting to tread more carefully as cracks appear in the five-year-old boom that sent rents soaring to records across the U.S. Construction concentrated in fast-growing urban markets has left cities from New York to Denver and San Francisco with a surplus of high-end units. Rent growth has already tapered off in some areas, and lenders are getting more selective about the projects they fund.Builders went upscale to preserve profits squeezed by rising land and labor costs. Now they'll need to work harder to find renters willing to pay a premium for trendy locations and frills such as rooftop pools and fire pits. About 30% of the apartment units under construction are in cities, compared with 15% in the previous decade, according to multifamily-data firm MPF Research.""Everybody fell in love with these markets and wanted to build -- but you can't build forever, it doesn't work that way,"" said Ryan Severino, chief economist at research firm Reis. ""The apartment market is losing steam.""The second quarter was the fifth straight in which construction exceeded net gains in occupancy, according to a report Reis issued early this month. With almost 200,000 units completed over the past 12 months, ""2016 is set to challenge records for construction figures, if not break them,"" the firm said.Apartment owners are the worst performers among real estate investment trusts this year. A measure of multifamily landlords has lost 0.3%, compared with a 12% gain for the broader Bloomberg REIT index. Equity Residential (EQR), the biggest U.S. apartment REIT, cut its revenue forecast when new leases in New York and San Francisco fell short of expectations because of an increase in supply in those cities.Effective rents in San Francisco, where apartment construction is at a record high, rose 2.6% in the second quarter after climbing 9.6% a year earlier, data from Axiometrics Inc. show. In Manhattan, deal sweeteners such as a free month were included in 13% of new leases in May, up from 1.6% a year earlier, according to a report by appraiser Miller Samuel Inc. and brokerage Douglas Elliman Real Estate.Smaller cities also are awash in high-end supply. In Denver, one of the nation's most robust economies, rents rose 4% in the second quarter from a year earlier, down from 11.2% growth for the same period in 2015, according to Axiometrics. Houston, reeling from the oil slump, will get 27,575 new units this year, more than any other U.S. city. Effective rents there, up 3.8% a year ago, dropped 1.4% in the second quarter.In Austin, Texas, where technology jobs are driving up wages, 12,130 units will be delivered over the next 12 months, the most since 1985, said Robin Davis, manager of data firm Apartmenttrends.com. The 1,124 apartments under construction downtown would expand that area's rental market by about 31%.Developer Mike Lynd has shelved a midrise building planned for suburban Austin with 325 units, and a tower of more than 30 stories in Houston. Lenders have started tightening underwriting, and land costs in Austin have doubled in three years, ""choking off the ability to add supply to Austin in a big way,"" he said.Average rents downtown, which increased 1.2% in the first quarter, would have been flat if not for the recent debuts of some of Austin's most-expensive buildings, Davis said.""The number of units coming online is at such a high price tag,"" she said. ""The central core is going to take time to absorb these units.""At one of those properties, Lynd's The Bowie, renters are being offered as much as eight weeks free for some floor plans. One-bedroom prices start at $2,000 a month, and amenities include a 36th-floor pool deck billed as the highest in Texas. The tower -- which opened a year ago and is 82% full -- is leasing out about 19 units a month, a pace Lynd said he's pleased with because the high rents limit demand. Financing approval for the project was based on a lease-up rate of 20 apartments a month, he said.Federal banking regulators in December urged commercial lenders to be vigilant in monitoring and managing risk and reinforced earlier warnings about competitive pressures and rapid growth in some lending markets.""Bad loans tend to happen in good times because of competition and the ease of capital liquidity -- it tends to be at this point in the cycle that banks and lenders increase their risk appetite,"" Richard Taft, deputy comptroller for credit risk at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, said in a phone interview.Rising interest rates or a decline in rental income would make it harder for borrowers to refinance when loans come due in a few years, said Sam Chandan, dean of the Schack Institute of Real Estate at New York University.""The possibility that rent growth will lose some momentum is not being taken into careful account by every lender in the market,"" Chandan said. ""If there was only one lender in the market, they wouldn't need to push the envelope. Competition is good, but right now it is particularly intense.""So far, borrowers have given commercial lenders no reason to panic. The delinquency rate for bank-held multifamily loans was 0.26% in the first quarter, the lowest since 2005, data from the Mortgage Bankers Association show. The share of loans at least 90 days late was as high as 4.71% in 2010. And banks getting more choosy may already be resulting in a trail-off of construction. Permits to start work on multifamily buildings have fallen 12% since January, Census Bureau data show.""Lenders are a little cautious because they think we've had our run and it's possible we've peaked,"" said Michael Riccio, senior managing director for debt and structured finance at CBRE Capital Markets, which brokers and originates commercial loans.Shores, the developer who's delaying the Atlanta building, said there are still opportunities to build. His company is moving ahead with a project in the city's fast-growing Midtown neighborhood.""We are, in selected markets, seeing a wave of supply come, so that we're just being cautious -- we're not stopping development,"" he said. ""We are making sure we have the best sites and best equity partners who have a longer-term focus.""

48,EQR,"How large of an investment opportunity is being created by the upcoming Sept. 1 expansion of the familiar 10 major sectors with the debut of a new, 11th sector devoted to real estate, in benchmarks such as the S&P 500 and others run by S&P Dow Jones Indices and MSCI?The impact could be big.Real estate stocks -- and the mutual funds holding many of them -- stand to get a windfall infusion of billions of dollars. Diversified stock funds would have to buy more than $100 billion of REIT stocks to wipe out their real-estate underweights relative to their benchmarks, according to JPMorgan. Investors, including many of those funds, are already buying REITs, says Mike Grupe, executive vice president of research and investor outreach of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT).""That sort of inflow could drive up stock prices,"" said Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF and mutual fund research for S&P Global Market Intelligence. ""Shareholders in funds holding real estate stocks could see at least a short-term bump up.""That's more likely to benefit shareholders in real-estate sector funds than U.S. diversified stock funds. Diversified funds are likely to be buyers, says Gregg Fisher, chief investment officer of investment management firm Gerstein Fisher and lead manager of three of its funds. Sector funds are already fully exposed to real estate.Still, diversified funds that are underweight also might boost their real estate weighting, says J. Scott Craig, manager of $43 million Eaton Vance Real Estate Fund (EIREX). ""If they hear from consultants and clients who look at fund reports (after Sept. 1) that show sector weightings, they might be pushed to act. Especially if their real estate weighting is still 0%, it could be a stark number.""Many mutual funds are bulking up on real estate stocks, including REITs, because their respective investment mandates call for them to hew to some degree to their benchmark's sector weightings, Grupe says. But no one knows how much in REIT stocks will eventually be bought, Rosenbluth says.As a result of the change, which was decided in late 2014, real estate will be broken out from the financial sector, of which it is now part.Real estate made up 2.45% of the S&P 500 Index and 3.19% of the MSCI ACWI global index as of March 31, according to Morningstar Inc. The average U.S. stock fund had a real estate weighting of  2.3%, compared with 4.4% for their benchmarks, as of Dec. 31.""REITs will also draw money simply because of increased exposure,"" Fisher said.With more attention drawn to real estate, more investors will chase the group's recent performance. Real estate funds were up 6.37% this year on average through June 16 vs. 0.82% for the average U.S. diversified stock fund, according to Lipper Inc. Also, they're up 11.42% over the past 52 weeks vs. a 5.26% loss for U.S. diversifieds.And REITs' outlook is attractive to many investors. Economic growth, even if it is slow, props up demand for real estate, Grupe says.And because share-price performance by real estate has a low correlation to stocks and bonds, real estate offers investors an attractive way to cut portfolio volatility stemming from those other asset classes.For example, U.S. stocks averaged only a 0.55 correlation to U.S. REITs from 1990 through 2015, according to Cohen & Steers. That means their performance resembled those of REITs by only a little more than 50%. U.S. bonds had only a 0.19 correlation to REITs.Fisher, whose investment approach is basically quantitative, says that CoreSite (COR) is a holding that illustrates the types of stocks that should draw new investor inflow.He says the stock has attractive metrics, such as price momentum and relative valuation.IBD readers are likely to notice that the stock has a 99 Composite Rating, the highest possible. The Composite Rating combines IBD's five performance ratings, including EPS and Relative Strength ratings. Stocks poised to move higher often have a high Composite Rating.It also has a 2.6% dividend yield.Craig's favorite segment going forward is apartment REITs. An expansion of supply amid slower revenue growth has hurt the segment, he says. But he likes Equity Residential (EQR) because it has been oversold. ""Investors have been right about the direction of the impact of slower revenue growth but wrong about the magnitude,"" he said.Equity Residential's focus is in coastal cities, where the apartment markets are strongest. New housing supply in those markets has hurt EQR's fundamentals, he says, but only ""quite modestly.""Craig also likes AvalonBay (AVB) and Essex Property (ESS), other apartment REITs that investors have oversold.AvalonBay is the biggest developer of apartment REITs, he says. And like EQR, it has heavy exposure to the ""sexy six"" -- Boston, Manhattan, the District of Columbia, Seattle, San Francisco and Los Angeles. ""These, I believe, are the six best long-term real estate markets in the U.S.,"" he said. ""They have highly educated work forces, high average household income, high cost of single-family housing, significant barriers to new construction and diversified economies. Those characteristics lead to greater rent growth and property price appreciation over the long term.""Essex, he adds, is a West Coast pure play. Avalon and Essex have dividend yields of 3.1% and 3%, respectively.In addition, he likes Federal Realty (FRT), a REIT with a 2.4% dividend yield, whose stock is not beaten down, he says. ""This REIT's portfolio includes a number of successful mixed-use properties, and it can add more of the same,"" he said.Grupe likes the office segment because new supply has been limited, he says, while demand keeps rising.And he likes self storage. ""We love our stuff,"" Grupe says about Americans. Economic growth enables people to pay for storing it.

49,EQR,"After four years of crammed open houses, heated competition and dizzying price gains that sent the median cost of a home to $1.2 million, San Francisco's real estate market is starting to lose steam.The inventory of luxury homes is at a record high. A smaller share of deals have bidding wars. Rent growth for large and upscale apartments is softening.While demand remains robust, real estate mania is waning in San Francisco, which has become one of the most prohibitively expensive U.S. housing markets thanks to a hiring boom for well-paid technology workers. Signs are emerging that prices may have gotten too high as job growth slows, venture-capital investment declines and the stock market stays sluggish.""It's not the absolute feeding frenzy that we had for the last three springs before this one,"" said Patrick Carlisle, chief market analyst at Paragon Real Estate Group in San Francisco. ""By any definition for the rest of the world, it's still a very, very strong market. It's just not as crazy hot as it has been.""Gains in home prices are plateauing, according to a Paragon report this month. In April and May, the median price of a house rose 2% from a year earlier to $1.38 million, compared with a 23% increase in 2015, the data show. The median condominium price was $1.13 million, unchanged, after a 21% jump the year before.The cooling is most notable at the high end of the market -- similar to a dynamic that's playing out in Silicon Valley as wealthy buyers and foreign investors pull back. There were a record 95 San Francisco houses on the market for at least $2.5 million at the end of April, up 42% from the previous year, according to Paragon. For luxury condos -- those $2 million and higher -- inventory climbed 44% to a high of 75 units. Sales of all luxury homes declined from January through May for the first time since 2010.A slowdown isn't necessarily bad news for a city where the median home price has soared 66% in four years, according to Zillow data, fueling tension between new workers and longtime residents who have become priced out. Only 13% of homebuyers can afford to purchase a median-priced single-family house in San Francisco, the California Association of Realtors said in a report last month.""It has definitely cooled a bit, which is a healthy thing,"" said Gregg Nelson, co-founder of Trumark, a Danville, Calif.-based developer that has eight projects in the Bay Area. ""It's more reflective of where prices are than a lack of demand.""San Francisco no longer ranks on a list compiled by brokerage Redfin of the 20 hottest U.S. housing markets. Denver, Seattle and Portland, Ore., are now taking the lead, according to a June 9 report that tracks listed homes expected to sell within two weeks. The California city surpasses those markets in the percentage of homes sold above the list price and the average sale-to-list price ratio.San Francisco homebuyers faced competition on 60% of offers written by Redfin agents last month, down from 81% a year earlier and in line with the national average.""It's still a place where homes are snatched off the market pretty quickly,"" said Nela Richardson, Redfin's chief economist. ""At the same time, the median sales price for the whole San Francisco metro is $1.2 million, and there comes a point even in San Francisco where prices outrun demand. We're closer to that point than we've been in years past.""Carmen Ho, a marketing consultant who began her search about a year ago, in April bought a house in the Mount Davidson Manor neighborhood for $1.5 million, about 18% more than the asking price. That's still less than the 60% above-asking offer another buyer made on a home she bid on earlier in her search.""It's not as hot as a year ago,"" said Ho, 42. ""The bids are not coming in as crazy as last year. People are a bit more cautious.""The tech industry, while still thriving, has seen job growth slow to 3.8% in the 12 months through April, compared with a 10% increase in the same period a year earlier. Venture-capital investments in Silicon Valley fell almost 20% in the first quarter from a year earlier to $4.9 billion, according to an April report from PricewaterhouseCoopers.The prospect of more takeovers such as Microsoft's (MSFT) $26.2 billion purchase of LinkedIn (LNKD) may also hinder housing demand. While LinkedIn hasn't announced a reduction in workers, broader tech consolidation could lead to job cuts that will hurt home prices and rents, said Kenneth Rosen, chairman of the Fisher Center for Real Estate and Urban Economics at the University of California, Berkeley.""You'll probably see more acquisitions of startups or early-stage companies,"" Rosen said. ""We have a lot of companies that do the same type of thing and they won't all survive, and that's where the job contraction will come.""Housing demand should still be propped up by a lack of new supply relative to the area's robust hiring in recent years, said Trumark's Nelson. While job gains are slowing, San Francisco's unemployment rate was 3.1% in April, the lowest since 2000.""There's not an adequate supply for the level of demand,"" he said. ""The prices are hindering what would otherwise be a lot more sales.""In the rental market, construction may be having more of an impact. Equity Residential (EQR), the largest publicly traded apartment landlord, on June 1 lowered its revenue forecast for the second time this year. The company, which mostly owns higher-end buildings, said new lease rates in San Francisco and New York aren't meeting its projections because of added rental supply.Rents are still rising across all segments, just not as fast as before, said Mark Uh, a housing data scientist at Trulia, a unit of Zillow Group (ZG). While studios and one-bedroom apartments are in strong demand, the market is cooling for three-bedrooms because of runaway prices and fewer potential renters, Uh said. The median monthly rent for a one-bedroom is $3,550, while a three-bedroom costs $6,500, Trulia data show.""I wouldn't say that rents are cratering,"" Uh said. ""It's just a matter of rents being really, really high already.""Related:America's Hottest Housing Markets Are Mainly Out WestHot Housing Market Spreading To America's HeartlandSkyrocketing Rents Are Sputtering -- But Mostly In High End Markets

51,EQR,"Real estate investment trusts are preparing for a surge of attention as they get their own grouping in major U.S. stock indexes. Their first task: educating investors who have no idea how to evaluate the industry.The companies -- which own properties such as apartment complexes, hotels, office towers and shopping malls -- are tweaking their disclosures, adding glossaries to their earnings statements and reaching out to investors to break free of the reputation of REITs as a quirky niche. The new industry classifications, which take effect in September, will separate real estate stocks from financials and make them their own category.The separate grouping means REITs will lure more generalists, defined as any money manager that doesn’t specialize in the area. The trouble is, such investors have little background in an industry that favors measures such as funds from operations or net asset value. Generalist funds are underinvested in REITs relative to their benchmarks by roughly $100 billion, in part because some of the concepts underpinning their analysis are unheard of elsewhere on Wall Street, JPMorgan Chase (JPM) analysts wrote in a note this month.“Everyone has shopped in a mall or lived in an apartment or driven past a warehouse,” said Alexander Goldfarb, an analyst at Sandler O’Neill & Partners in New York. “It should be really easy to understand, but it becomes very complicated because of the terminology.”While REITs have been around since the 1960s, the industry ballooned following the real estate bust in the 1990s as cash-strapped companies turned to public markets when private funding dried up. The trusts are being carved out into their own category by S&P Global’s S&P Dow Jones indexes and MSCI (MSCI) after a surge in valuations. Equity REIT market capitalization more than doubled to $886 billion from 2007 to 2015, according to the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts.The property companies now make up about 3% of the S&P 500 Index. With the new classification, money managers who track benchmark gauges will be adjusting their portfolios to include REIT stocks. Cohen & Steers (CNS) estimates $100 billion will flow into the shares.REITs began taking steps in their first-quarter earnings reports to make it easier for fund managers who aren’t versed in the industry’s idiosyncratic lingo to understand their business. Equity Residential (EQR), the apartment owner taken public by billionaire Sam Zell in 1993, introduced a list of key terms and definitions.The Chicago-based landlord reached out to a broader pool of investors to prepare for the new classification about a year ago, and found that investors who hadn’t bought REIT shares didn’t find commonly cited measures such as per-square-foot rent helpful in understanding earnings power, said Chief Financial Officer Mark Parrell.Equity Residential added the glossary so investors who have never looked at a real estate company before can make some sense of its financial statements, he said. The landlord also changed its investor presentation to start with thematic topics such as the preference for urban living rather than diving straight into detailed data on its properties, he said.“This doesn’t mean we won’t communicate to our real estate investors,” Parrell said. “It’s important for us to be bilingual.”It’s easy for a novice in any industry to get tripped up by jargon, but REIT jargon is particularly hard for the uninitiated. For example, analysts eschew the familiar measure of earnings per share when gauging REIT performance. Instead, they look at a company’s funds from operations, or FFO, which excludes items such as the cost of depreciation. That’s because while a telecommunications company can expect its fiber optic cables to lose value over time, an office landlord expects the value of its properties to rise.“Unless you own really bad buildings, real estate tends to hold its value or appreciate over time,” said Sandler O’Neill’s Goldfarb. “Depreciation isn’t really a factor.”In order to get at just how much all those buildings are worth, analysts and investors work out a company’s NAV, or net asset value. It’s one of the most important calculations for understanding the intrinsic value of a REIT, and something generalists who might not know the real estate market could wrestle with, Goldfarb said.At shopping-center owner Kimco Realty (KIM), the glossary was moved to the front of the company’s first-quarter financial disclosures to make them easier for investors to digest, according to David Bujnicki, a senior vice president at the New Hyde Park, N.Y.-based company. Previously, it was buried in the back, he said. In addition to FFO, disoriented investors can look up ABR (annualized base rent), GLA (gross leasable area) and economic occupancy, too.“Real estate has its own vernacular,” said Owen Thomas, chief executive officer of Boston Properties (BXP), which owns stakes in marquee real estate including Manhattan’s General Motors Building and San Francisco’s Embarcadero Center. “Once an investor takes the time to learn the terminology, I think it can be understood relatively quickly.”Boston Properties is extending its investor-relations efforts to include more dialogue with managers who oversee broader portfolios, Thomas said.Yet it may be a precarious moment to jump into real estate. Commercial-property prices are flattening after six years of record-shattering growth, hurt by concerns ranging from slumping oil prices to slowing economic growth in China.REIT shares have taken a hit recently on speculation that the Federal Reserve may raise interest rates again as soon as June. Higher rates increase the companies’ borrowing costs and diminish the attractiveness of their dividend yield.Simon Property Group (SPG) -- the largest REIT, with a market value of about $60 billion -- is “very focused” on soliciting new investors, said Les Morris, a spokesman for the Indianapolis-based mall owner.“We do feel this is an opportunity for us as these investors are focused on cash flow growth, earnings and dividend growth, and strong balance sheet metrics, which plays to our strengths,” Morris said in an emailed statement.Meeting face-to-face is crucial in getting generalist investors comfortable, said Kimco’s Bujnicki. The company, credited with jump-starting the modern REIT era with its initial public offering in 1991, has set a goal to schedule half of its meetings at conferences and on road trips with non-REIT fund managers, he said.“The idea for us is to get in front of these investors and start to get face time,” Bujnicki said.Related:REITs Attract Investor Interest In Volatile MarketHealth-Care REITs: A Dividend Play On An Aging PopulationHotel REITS Offer Hefty Yields, But Not All Are Equal

80,EQR,"The median Denver house was $285,000 in the third quarter, up 9.7% from a year earlier, according to the Colorado Association of Realtors. But Denver is still far more affordable than New York or California, say the Lodhas, who plan to buy a house in coming months.Lyndsey and Sameer Lodha had their pick of cities after Sameer, a former equities trader who's now a hand surgeon, got several job offers upon completing his residency.They passed on New York, where Sameer lived when he worked at Goldman Sachs Group (GS), and San Francisco because both were too expensive. They chose Denver as their home base, moving into an apartment with their 16-month-old daughter in August.""We wanted green and outdoor space but we don't want to live in the suburbs,"" said Lyndsey, 34, an anesthetist. Denver had ""open spaces, great school options and a very vibrant city life. And it's affordable.""An influx of young families in search of alternatives to the most-expensive U.S. coastal markets is fueling a real estate boom in Denver, where commercial-property spending and home prices have jumped to records. Apartment and office developers seeking to capitalize on employment growth are creating an urban center that has ""started to compete very well against other higher-tier cities,"" said Steve Ferris, development services director for the city and county of Denver.Spending on construction of new commercial buildings this year is estimated at about $2.55 billion, up 26% from 2012 and the most in at least two decades, according to the city Community Planning & Development Department.New York and San Francisco remain far bigger commercial real estate markets that are unlikely to lose their allure as major cities any time soon. For some investors and would-be residents, Denver is becoming attractive because of its cheaper costs and growing downtown, said Christopher Frampton, a partner at Avon, Colo.-based developer East West Partners.'A True Mix'""What's working for Denver is that it's less expensive than San Francisco and New York, but that at the same time it has a growing and diverse industry — mutual funds, natural gas, technology,"" Frampton said. ""Denver now has a vibrant downtown. It never used to. So now you have a true mix of city and sky.""East West, which has Starwood Capital Group founder Barry Sternlicht as an equity partner on its downtown projects, has 575,000 square feet of office, residential and retail real estate under development in the Union Station and Riverfront Park neighborhoods. As many as 1.5 million square feet more of offices are planned.The city's expanding young population is a boon for apartment developers, says Frampton, whose company has built at least 10 residential projects in downtown Denver. Equity Residential (EQR), America's largest publicly traded multifamily landlord, put the Mile High City in its top three growth markets for 2014.Of the top 25 U.S. metropolitan areas, Denver was tied with Seattle for the third-biggest increase in 25- to 34-year-old residents from 2008 to 2012, data from the Census Bureau and Moody's Analytics (MCO) show. The 9.1% gain trailed only Washington, with a 12% jump, and Baltimore, with a 9.6% gain. Los Angeles and New York were among areas with the smallest increases in that age group.Colorado is home to some of the nation's most popular skiing destinations, with Vail and six other resorts a two-hour drive or less from Denver's center. The city's restaurant scene is also a draw.The city attracts young firms seeking an educated workforce, according to Ferris. DaVita HealthCare Partners (DVA), the country's second-biggest dialysis provider, relocated its base from Los Angeles in 2010, lured by Denver's affordability, diverse talent pool and accessible mass transit, said David Maughan, senior vice president of operations.""We have found it's much easier to recruit to Denver with lower taxes, lower cost of living and so many sunny days,"" he said.The Denver area's unemployment rate was 6% in October, according to the most recent figures from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, which aren't seasonally adjusted. That was below 7.8% in the New York City metropolitan area and the 7% nationwide average.Office rents in Denver averaged $20.08 a square foot in the third quarter, about even with their pre-recession peak, according to brokerage CBRE Group (CBG). By contrast, the national average is 11% less than the 2008 high of $31.19.""The market is able to support such rent growth because office-using employment is expanding beyond its peak level, helping to generate healthy demand for space,"" said Arthur Jones, senior managing economist at CBRE.The third-quarter vacancy rate was 14.6%, below the market average since 1990 and near a pre-recession low of 14.2%, CBRE data show.Government spending on transit upgrades has helped spur the flurry of private investment, according to Ferris, whose office oversees reviews of development proposals.Brookfield Office Properties (BPO), owner of Denver's two tallest office towers, is in the market long-term, said David Sternberg, senior vice president overseeing investment in the Midwest and mountain regions.The New York firm is spending $50 million to renovate the smaller of the buildings, bought for $215 million in December 2011. The property, 1801 California, was more than two-thirds empty at the time. Occupancy, estimated at 60% at the end of 2013, is poised to increase further after the work is done in the first quarter, according to Sternberg.Sales of Denver office properties likely will reach $2.07 billion for 2013, up 18% from 2012 and the most since 2007, according to data from Real Capital Analytics. The research firm estimates apartment-building purchases of $2.16 billion, down from 2012's $2.66 billion — the highest in at least a decade.The city has a long way to go before ranking with a top investment market like Manhattan, where $19 billion of office properties and $8.4 billion of apartment buildings changed hands in 2013 through Dec. 19, Real Capital data show.""Coastal cities like New York, San Francisco or Boston will never lose their appeal, both for workers and for investors,"" said demographer William Frey, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. ""The job market in these cities is immense and it attracts a large amount of people, domestically and from other places. That will never change.""Rising interest in Denver has created more competition and priced out some investors. The city's popularity also is making it harder for some families to buy. Denver and Dallas are the only two U.S. areas where single-family home prices have passed boom-era levels, the Case-Shiller index of 20 cities shows. Denver prices are 4.6% above their 2006 high. The U.S. average is still about 20% below peak.The median Denver house was $285,000 in the third quarter, up 9.7% from a year earlier, according to the Colorado Association of Realtors. But Denver is still far more affordable than New York or California, say the Lodhas, who plan to buy a house in coming months.

84,EQR,"What do three ETFs holding real estate investment trusts, dividend leaders and less volatile stocks have in common? Very little, except that they are all worthy of your watch list.Keep in mind that IBD's ETF market strategy calls for extreme caution in the stock market today. With the market in correction, it's time to focus more on capital preservation than capital appreciation.As you wait for a new uptrend to announce itself, get to know these exchange traded funds. They're each trading 7% or less below buy points.IShares Residential Real Estate Capped (REZ) is somewhat deceptively named. The ETF tracks a cap-weighted index of U.S. residential, health care, hotel and self-storage REITs.REZ holds 45 securities, giving 12% portfolio weighting to No. 1 holding Public Storage (PSA) alone. No. 2 holding Equity Residential (EQR) accounts for an additional 10%.Public Storage has an IBD Composite Rating of 98, based on various technical and fundamental measures, out of a best-possible 99. The REIT acquires, owns and operates self-storage facilities — 2,250 in 38 U.S. states and 192 in Europe.REZ is holding up fairly well amid the stock market's abysmal start to 2016. It is trading above both its 50- and 200-day moving averages, which mark key levels of support, and is within 6% of a 65.90 buy point.Not all breakouts succeed. But REZ broke out of a cup base in October 2014 and ran up 30% by January 2015.REITs offer potential for long-term capital appreciation as well as income generation. REZ yields 3.18% vs. 2.06% for SPDR S&P 500 (SPY).The ETF is relatively thinly traded, at less than 50,000 shares a day on average.However, its upward-sloping relative strength line means that the ETF is outperforming the S&P 500 index.The RS line is also moving to new high ground ahead of its potential breakout, a bullish sign for successful investing.REZ jumped 11.4% in 2015 vs. a 1.3% gain for SPY, a proxy for the broad market.An RS Rating of 81 means that REZ's price performance has surpassed 81% of all other publicly traded stocks in the past 12 months.First Trust Morningstar Dividend Leaders (FDL) is 6.7% below a buy point of 24.63.The ETF holds roughly 100 companies with consistent and sustained dividend payments. Its top three holdings are Exxon Mobil (XOM), AT&T (T) and Verizon (VZ). It yields 3.65%.However, FDL has largely moved sideways in the past year. It is languishing below its 50- and 200-day lines.In 2015, the ETF advanced 2.6%. It has an RS Rating of 73.IShares MSCI USA Minimum Volatility (USMV) is within 6.9% of a 42.73 buy point from a flat base.The ETF's last breakout, on Aug. 5, ended with a whimper. It netted investors a 4.1% gain by Aug. 19 before the ETF began consolidating again.Income-producing and low-volatility stocks are finding their way into investors' ETF strategies amid a challenging environment for stocks.USMV absorbed $3.41 billion in new money in 2015.

85,EQR,"Special Report: Income Investing 2016Yield isn't hard to find in the stock market, especially in the real estate investment trust (REIT) space, but focusing on yield alone for generating income can often result in underperformance.According to recent data from the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, the average REIT dividend at the end of September was 4.4%. Certain sectors of the REIT universe offer even more tempting yields, such as health care REITs, whose dividend yields averaged 5.8%, and mortgage REITs, whose yields average a whopping 11.6%.Selecting the right REIT to generate investment income is a lot more than just focusing on the highest-yielding names. Ed Cowling, director of specialty assets at U.S. Bank Wealth Management agrees. ""With higher yield comes higher risk,"" he said.Under REIT rules, companies must distribute at least 90% of their taxable income to shareholders as dividends to avoid paying most corporate taxes.Of course, REITs prefer to access cheap money to acquire and develop properties to spur growth. In general, rising rates mean higher borrowing costs, which can cut into a REIT's profits and valuation.Higher interest rates are on Wall Street's mind these days, but the Fed has been very transparent about a slow and steady approach to rate hikes in light of a choppy U.S. economic recovery, low oil prices and uncertainty in China.Interest rates rising at a snail's pace likely will not have a material impact on REITs. ""Interest rate hikes tend to happen when the economy is improving, and a strengthening economy is usually when REITs are thriving,"" Cowling said.Matt Werner, portfolio manager of the West Loop Realty Fund, has had a pretty good year in a challenging environment for REITs. It's a small fund with assets just north of $80 million, but performance has been solid so far.Year to date, the fund ranks No. 5 out of 286 funds in its category as tracked by Morningstar. The fund is outperforming the S&P 500 this year, and it's also broadly outperforming its benchmark, the MSCI U.S. REIT index.Net of fees and expenses, the fund is up 1.3% year to date, compared with a 1.3% decline for the MSCI AWCI index.According to Werner, individual investors shouldn't be obsessing about the Fed so much. ""REITs have performed fairly well during historical times of rate hikes. The Fed is a potential driver of short-term volatility that will have little effect on the long-term positive fundamentals,"" he said.An overweight allocation to the data center/tech sector has helped the fund's performance. According to Werner, cell-tower REITs should be the beneficiaries of carriers deploying recently acquired spectrum, as well as continued expansion of small cell sites.Data-center REITs, meanwhile, will continue to benefit from increased corporate data outsourcing, the growth of the cloud, and the need for speedy delivery of data.Among the cell-tower operators, Werner likes American Tower (AMT) and Crown Castle (CCI). In the data-center space, he likes CoreSite Realty (COR) and CyrusOne (CONE). Funds from operations (FFO) at CoreSite are expected to rise 31% this year and 17% in 2016. Growth prospects at CyrusOne are just as solid with FFO seen rising 23% this year and 18% in 2016.An underweight allocation to the health care sector is also contributing to outperformance. In his October REIT commentary, Werner wrote that health care REITs are the most correlated to interest rates, and some have disclosed rent coverage issues among tenants, as well as a heightened threat of new supply in senior housing.Assuming no unusual shocks to the U.S. economy in 2016, Werner thinks select REITs have a good chance of outperforming next year. If the economy continues to improve in 2016, Werner expects self-storage, lodging, apartments and mall REITs to be the biggest beneficiaries if job growth continues to improve.In the self-storage space, Werner likes Sovran Self Storage (SSS). It owns a Composite Rating of 93 from IBD, helped by double-digit revenue gains for 16 straight quarters. Among apartment REITs, he owns Camden Property Trust (CPT) and Equity Residential (EQR). According to Werner, the fundamental outlook for apartments remains strong, supported by relatively low new supply and an improving job market.According to Morningstar ETF analyst Bob Goldsborough, REITs with shorter lease durations generally do better in rising-rate environments because they can go back to tenants more frequently and get higher rents. REITs with longer lease durations, like the health care and office segments, don't have that luxury.""REIT funds more devoted to hotels, multifamily and self storage should be less affected by rates than those heavy in retail, office and health care,"" he said.In terms of REIT ETFs, Goldsborough likes low-cost names likes Schwab U.S. REIT ETF (SCHH) and Vanguard REIT ETF (VNQ).iShares Cohen & Steers REIT ETF (ICF) is a little more costly to own, but it's also a solid choice, according to Goldsborough. ICF owns the 30 largest REITS.

108,EQR,"In the peak leasing season, residential REIT AvalonBay Communities Inc. (AVB  -  Free Report) is expected to benefit from its high quality assets located in some of the premium markets of the country. In fact, in 2017, the company delivered the seventh consecutive year of above-sector average core funds from operations (FFO) per share growth, which is encouraging. Based on its strong fundamentals, this uptrend is expected to continue going forward.Moreover, in the recently-announced quarterly update, AvalonBay noted that it expects total rental revenues for established communities in Q2 to climb 2.4-2.5% from the prior-year period. The mid-point of the latest outlook denotes a 15-basis-point expansion from what the company had previously projected. The company had reported a 2.4% increase in rental revenues for established communities in the first quarter.Increasing consumer confidence backed by job growth, rising wages and a healthier balance sheet promise solid prospects for AvalonBay. Additionally, corporate profits are up and business confidence has recovered.Also, demographic growth continues to be strong in the young-adult age cohort, which has a higher propensity to rent. This age cohort has also experienced a considerable part of net job growth and is helping spur primary renter demand. Household formation is also picking up pace, which is encouraging.Furthermore, the company has a healthy balance sheet and ample liquidity to support its growth needs. As of Mar 31, 2018, AvalonBay had no borrowings outstanding under its $1.5-billion unsecured credit facility. In addition, the company’s annualized net debt-to-core EBITDA for first-quarter 2018 was 5.1 times.Nonetheless, hike in interest rate can pose a challenge for the company. Essentially, rising rates imply higher borrowing cost for the company, which may affect its ability to purchase or develop real estate and lower dividend payouts as well. Further, the dividend payout might become less attractive compared to the yields on fixed income and money market accounts.In addition to the above, new apartment deliveries are anticipated to remain elevated in the company’s markets in 2018 and modestly decrease in 2019. Specifically, Metro New York, New Jersey and Mid-Atlantic regions are likely to remain choppy amid rising supply of residential units in upcoming quarters.In addition, supply continues to be most noticeable in the urban sub-markets. This high supply in a number of the company’s markets is likely to put pressure on rental rates. Hence, growth in its stabilized portfolio is likely to remain modest in the upcoming period. Furthermore, there is high concession activity amid higher supply, which remains a concern.Nevertheless, AvalonBay is not the only company reeling under this high supply pressure. Other residential REITS like Equity Residential (EQR  -  Free Report) and Essex Property Trust Inc. (ESS  -  Free Report) too are facing the brunt. This unhealthy environment is unlikely to dissipate any time soon, with aggressive deliveries feared to continue into early next year as well.Per a report from real estate technology and analytics firm — RealPage, Inc.

109,EQR,"In the recently-announced quarterly update, residential REIT AvalonBay Communities Inc. (AVB  -  Free Report) noted that it expects total rental revenues for established communities in Q2 to climb 2.4-2.5% from the prior-year period.The midpoint of the latest outlook denotes a 15 basis point expansion from what the company had previously projected for the second quarter when it provided the 2018 established communities total rental revenue growth outlook this January. The company reported a 2.4% increase in rental revenues for established communities in the first quarter.Established communities refer to those consolidated communities which have stabilized occupancy as of Jan 1, 2017, and are neither executing nor planning any significant redevelopment work, and are not held for sale or planned for disposition in the current year.Moreover, the company mentioned that it has begun construction on two new communities for an estimated total capital cost of around $205 million in the second quarter. On the other hand, the company sold two wholly-owned operating communities for approximately $195 million. Two other wholly-owned communities are under contract or in advanced marketing stages for a projected price of around $280 million.Notably, in the peak leasing session, AvalonBay is expected to benefit from its high quality assets in premium locations, favorable demographics, household formation, recovering economy and job market growth.However, new apartment deliveries are anticipated to remain elevated in the company’s markets in 2018 and modestly descend in 2019. Specifically, the Metro New York, New Jersey and Mid-Atlantic regions are likely to remain turbulent amid rising supply of residential units in the upcoming quarters. In fact, in the Mid-Atlantic region, supply is expected to continue through 2019, while in New York, New Jersey market, supply might attain peak level this year, before declining in 2019. Additionally, supply continues to be the most noticeable in the urban sub-markets.This high supply in a number of the company’s markets is likely to put pressure on rental rates. Hence, growth in AvalonBay’s stabilized portfolio is expected to remain modest in the near future. Furthermore, there is high concession activity amid higher supply, which remains a concern.Nonetheless, this elevated supply has not only affected AvalonBay, but other residential REITs as well, including Equity Residential (EQR  -  Free Report) and Essex Property Trust Inc. (ESS  -  Free Report), curbing their near-term growth momentum to some extent. And there seems to be no respite from this   dreary environment any time soon, with aggressive deliveries anticipated to continue through early next year too.In fact, according to a report from real estate technology and analytics firm — RealPage, Inc. (RP  -  Free Report) — during the last half of 2017, across the nation’s 150 largest metros “annual pace of completions” climbed above the 300,000-unit level.

You should consider the SPDR Russell 1000 Low Volatility Focus ETF (ONEV  -  Free Report), a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on 12/02/2015.The fund is sponsored by State Street Global Advisors. It has amassed assets over $445.25 M, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Blend segment of the US equity market.Why Large Cap BlendLarge cap companies usually have a market capitalization above $10 billion. Considered a more stable option, large cap companies boast more predictable cash flows and are less volatile than their mid and small cap counterparts.Typically holding a combination of both growth and value stocks, blend ETFs also demonstrate qualities seen in value and growth investments.CostsWhen considering an ETF's total return, expense ratios are an important factor, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts in the long term if all other factors remain equal.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.20%, making it one of the cheaper products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.91%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsIt is important to delve into an ETF's holdings before investing despite the many upsides to these kinds of funds like diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Consumer Discretionary sector--about 18.70% of the portfolio. Industrials and Financials round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Sysco Corporation (SYY  -  Free Report) accounts for about 1.07% of total assets, followed by Baxter International Inc. (BAX  -  Free Report) and Equity Residential (EQR  -  Free Report).The top 10 holdings account for about 8.97% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskONEV seeks to match the performance of the Russell 1000 Low Volatility Focused Factor Index before fees and expenses. The Russell 1000 Low Volatility Focused Factor Index reflects the performance of a segment of large-capitalization U.S. equity securities demonstrating a combination of core factors high value, high quality, and low size characteristics, with a focus factor comprising low volatility characteristics.The ETF has lost about -1.45% so far this year and was up about 9.49% in the last one year (as of 05/02/2018).

While iShares Core S&P 500 ETF has $142.94 B in assets, SPDR S&P 500 ETF has $252.80 B. IVV has an expense ratio of 0.04% and SPY charges 0.09%.Bottom-LineRetail and institutional investors increasingly turn to passively managed ETFs because they offer low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency; these kind of funds are also excellent vehicles for long term investors.To learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.

111,EQR,"Ushering in good news for its shareholders, Cousins Properties (CUZ  -  Free Report) recently announced an 8.3% hike in the company's quarterly cash dividend. The company will now pay a dividend of 6.5 cents per share. The raised dividend will be paid on Apr 13, 2018, to shareholders of record as of Apr 3.Based on the increased rate for the first quarter of 2018, the annual dividend comes to 26 cents a share. At this new rate, annualized yield comes at 2.98% based on the stock’s closing price of $8.70 on Mar 19.We believe Cousins Properties has adequate capacity to support its enhanced dividend payout. In February, the company reported fourth-quarter 2017 FFO per share of 15 cents, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. Further, the figure compared favorably with 7 cents recorded in the year-ago period.Quarterly results at this real estate investment trust (REIT) reflected a rise in second-generation net rent per square foot on a cash basis.Notably, Cousins Properties’ diversified portfolio,  presence of high-end tenants in its roster, opportunistic investments in best sub-markets and a conservative balance sheet keeps the growth momentum going. As such, the company remains well poised to boost shareholders’ wealth.However, the company faces stiff competition from other market players. This impacts its ability to retain and attract tenants at higher rents. Further, rising supply of office space and hike in interest rates remain concerns.In fact, solid dividend payouts remain arguably the biggest attraction for REIT investors as the U.S. law requires these companies to distribute 90% of the annual taxable income in the form of dividends to shareholders. Apart from Cousins Properties, some other REITs, which announced dividend hikes in recent months are Equity Residential (EQR  -  Free Report), Digital Realty (DLR  -  Free Report) and Prologis Inc. (PLD  -  Free Report).Cousins Properties' shares have dropped 5% in the past three months, against the 5.4% loss incurred by the industry it belongs to.Cousins Properties currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Note: Anything related to earnings presented in this write-up represent funds from operations (FFO) — a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

112,EQR,"Equity Residential (EQR  -  Free Report) finally declared an increase in its first-quarter 2018 dividend. The company will now pay 54 cents for the quarter, which reflects a hike of 7.2% from the prior dividend of 50.375 cents.Notably, during the fourth-quarter 2017 earnings release, the company announced its decision to no longer fix the common share dividend as a fixed percentage of estimated normalized funds of operations (FFO). Rather, the company will embrace a more conventional policy that is based on actual and projected financial conditions, actual and projected liquidity and operating results, projected cash needs for capital expenditures and other investment activities. Therefore, with its development spend reduced substantially and solid growth in property operations, the company anticipates experiencing considerable increase in available cash flow in the near future.Based on the hiked rate of 54 cents for the quarter, the annual dividend comes to $2.16 per share. This new dividend will be paid on Apr 13, to shareholders of record on Mar 26, 2018. At this new rate, annualized yield comes at 3.62% based on the stock’s closing price of $59.72 on Mar 15.The company also announced that its Annual Meeting of Shareholders will be held on Jun 14, 2018 in Chicago, IL.  We believe Equity Residential has adequate capacity to support its dividend policy. Later this January, the company reported fourth-quarter 2017 normalized FFO per share of 83 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 81 cents. The figure also came in higher than 79 cents reported in the year-ago quarter.Quarterly results at this apartment real estate investment trust (REIT) mirrored enhanced same-store net operating income (NOI) and lease-up NOI. However, the company incurred higher corporate overhead in the quarter.Notably, Equity Residential has been making concerted efforts to reposition its portfolio in high barrier-to-entry/core markets. It is anticipated to benefit from favorable demographics, lifestyle transformation and creation of new households. As such, we believe the company remains well poised to boost shareholders’ wealth.However, new apartment supply across Equity Residential’s markets might continue to put pressure on new lease rates, occupancy, retention and result in high concessions as well. Furthermore, rate hike remains another concern.Notably, solid dividend payouts remain arguably the biggest attraction for REIT investors as the U.S. law requires these companies to distribute 90% of the annual taxable income in the form of dividends to shareholders. Apart from Equity Residential, some other REITs which announced dividend hikes in recent months are Digital Realty (DLR  -  Free Report), Prologis Inc. (PLD  -  Free Report) and Simon Property Group, Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report).Shares of Equity Residential have outperformed the industry it belongs to, over the past month. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s shares have gained 3.0%, while the industry recorded growth of 2.2% during this time frame.

113,EQR,"JP Morgan has launched a new fund focused on providing exposure to the U.S. equity space. It invests in companies with low volatility. JPMorgan U.S. Minimum Volatility ETF JMIN tracks the JP Morgan US Minimum Volatility Index.  Fund Characteristics The fund utilizes a rules-based methodology to select stocks based on volatility. It has AUM of $25.7 million and seeks to provide exposure to low risk equities, while minimizing unsystematic risk. It charges 12 basis points as fee per year and has top holdings in NVR Inc, Walmart Stores Inc and Brownforman Corp, with 0.8%, 0.7% and 0.7% exposure, respectively (as of Dec 6, 2017). It bears less concentration risk as all, just a little over 7.0%, is allocated to the top 10 holdings. From a sector look, the fund has high exposure to Health Care, Consumer Goods and Utilities, with 20.4%, 19.4% and 17.0% exposure, respectively (as of Dec 6, 2017).  Market Impact The Senate voted 51-49 in favor of the tax reform. Although there are multiple hurdles for the tax reform to become a law, Trump called the Senate vote a major victory and the Republican Party unbeatable. “Unless they have somebody that we don’t know about, right now we’re unbeatable,” said Trump. The House and Senate differ radically on what they want to establish from the tax reform. Multiple compromises might be needed to come to a conclusion. For instance, the House wants to abolish the estate tax, whereas the Senate wants to raise it. If there are significant negotiations made in reconciling the two plans, appeal for low volatility funds might increase. There is increased uncertainty with regard to Trump’s deregulation plans. This might increase investors’ appeal for safety and in turn make them shift to low volatility funds. Competition The fund faces high competition from other funds focused on providing exposure to the same space. Below we discuss a few ETFs that seek to provide exposure to this corner (see all Total Market (U.S.) ETFs here). iShares Edge MSCI Min Vol USA ETF (USMV  -  Free Report) This fund seeks to provide exposure to U.S. companies that are more or less immune to volatility.  It has AUM of $15.0 billion and charges a fee of 15 basis points a year. From a sector look, the fund has high exposure to Information Technology, Health Care and Consumer Staples with 19.6%, 16.6% and 13.3% allocation, respectively (as of Dec 6, 2017).

The fund has returned 19.0% in a year and 16.4% year to date (as of Dec 7, 2017). It has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold) with a Medium risk outlook. PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility Portfolio (SPLV  -  Free Report) This fund seeks to provide exposure to U.S. companies that are more or less immune to volatility.  It has AUM of $7.3 billion and charges a fee of 25 basis points a year.

114,EQR,"Broader macroeconomic concerns as well as a rise in Treasury yield have affected returns on REIT stocks in recent months. However, the operating performance of this special hybrid asset class was decent in the third quarter.In fact, per a NAREIT media release, occupancy rates reached a record high in the third quarter, while funds from operations (“FFO”), a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs, reported growth from the year-ago period.Specifically, the Q3 scorecard reveals that total FFO of $14.8 billion for the listed U.S. Equity REIT industry increased 7.8% year over year. However, the figure was 4.5% lower sequentially.Same-store net operating income (NOI) increased 3.2% year over year. Results were driven by segments like Manufactured Homes, Diversified, Single Family Homes, Industrial, and Data Centers, which witnessed robust same-store NOI growth of 7.1%, 7.0%, 6.8%, 4.7% and 4.2%, respectively.Importantly, properties owned by the listed Equity REITs enjoyed solid occupancy levels. In fact, the occupancy rate climbed 50 basis points to a record high of 94.0%.Notably, growth in cloud computing, Internet of Things and big data is not only helping tech companies, but also driving demand for data center REITs. Moreover, the industrial asset category has hogged attention on the back of robust demand, recovering economy and job market, strengthening e-commerce market and healthy manufacturing environment.The residential real estate market benefited from healthy demand levels and a delay in deliveries that kept the supply number at check. No doubt, shrinking mall traffic and store closures amid aggressive growth in online sales kept retail REITs on tenterhooks. However, retail REITs managed to grab attention from new and productive tenants, and made their best efforts to replace with the ones which have departed.Among the S&P 500 REIT constituents, data center REIT — Digital Realty Trust (DLR  -  Free Report) — and industrial REIT — Duke Realty (DRE  -  Free Report) — delivered better-than-expected results in the quarter, with positive surprises of nearly 1.3% and 3.5%, respectively, in terms of FFO per share. Also, retail REIT, Regency Centers (REG  -  Free Report), and residential REIT, Equity Residential (EQR  -  Free Report) surpassed estimates, registering a positive surprise of 4.4% and around 1.3%, respectively.Moreover, solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticement for REIT shareholders. Dividend from Equity and Mortgage REITs aggregated $12.8 billion, denoting a 0.6% increase sequentially. Total dividends paid out were also up 4.1% from the prior-year quarter.Currently, Regency Centers has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) while Digital Realty, Duke Realty and Equity Residential carries a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Note: All EPS numbers presented in this write up represent funds from operations (“FFO”) per share.

116,EQR,"Equity Residential (EQR  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter 2017 normalized funds from operations (FFO) per share of 80 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. The figure came in higher than 78 cents reported in the year-ago quarter.Results mirror enhanced same-store net operating income (NOI) and lease-up NOI. However, the company experienced adverse impact on NOI, primarily stemming from its 2016 and 2017 transaction activity. Also, it incurred elevated interest expense and higher corporate overhead in the quarter.Moreover, total revenues in the reported quarter came in at $624.1 million, indicating 3.0% growth from the prior-year period. In addition, the figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $619.6 million.Per management, steady rental demand during peak leasing period helped deliver solid occupancy, retention and renewal pricing. This assisted in alleviating the impact from high supply in the company’s markets.Equity Residential now expects to deliver same-store revenue growth at the upper end of its original projections for the year. Also, with the latest favorable real estate tax appeals, the company anticipates generating same-store NOI growth at the upper end of its initial expectations.Quarter in DetailSame-store revenues (includes 72,049 apartment units) were up 2.2% year over year to $587.1 million, while expenses climbed 1.7% year over year to $173.8 million. As a result, same-store NOI advanced 2.4% year over year to $413.3 million.The company experienced 2.1% growth in average rental rate to $2,709. Occupancy expanded 20 basis points from the year-ago quarter to 96.2% for same-store portfolio.The company exited third-quarter 2017 with cash and cash equivalents of around $46.6 million, up from $37.7 million recorded at the end of the prior quarter.Portfolio ActivityDuring the reported quarter, Equity Residential acquired three consolidated apartment properties in Boston, Los Angeles and Bellevue, WA, comprising 811 apartment units, for around $411.0 million.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at 81 cents.The company revised its projections for full-year 2017 same-store operating performance and FFO per share. It now estimates normalized FFO per share in the $3.10-$3.14 range compared with the prior guidance of $3.08-$3.14. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.11 lies within this range.For the same-store portfolio, the company revised expectations for physical occupancy to 95.9% from 95.8% and revenue growth to 2.2% from the previously guided range of 1.75-2.25%.

The company is anticipated to benefit from its efforts to reposition the portfolio in high barrier-to-entry/core markets, favorable demographics, lifestyle transformation and creation of new households. The company’s current focus is on the acquisition and development of assets primarily in the six core coastal metropolitan areas — Boston, New York, Washington D.C., Southern California, San Francisco and Seattle. However, elevated levels of new supply in its markets remain concerns.Equity Residential currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

117,EQR,"We are in the heart of the Q3 reporting cycle and the real estate investment trust (REIT) space is buzzing with activity. In fact, there is a deluge of Q3 earnings releases line up for this week, of which Equity Residential (EQR  -  Free Report) and Iron Mountain Incorporated (IRM  -  Free Report) will release quarterly numbers on Oct 24.No doubt, the Minutes from the September Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which clearly signal a December rate hike, have kept investors in the REIT space worried to some extent. This is because REITs depend on debt for their business, and pay high and consistent dividend. Thus, a higher rate affects the present value of future cash flows.Nevertheless, with improvement in the macroeconomic scenario, at a steady yet sluggish pace, demand for a number of asset categories displayed strength in third-quarter 2017. Though supply has been increasing, the pace has been modest in many of the asset categories.According to a study by the real estate technology and analytics firm — RealPage, Inc. (RP  -  Free Report) —the U.S. apartment market recorded stable rent growth, while occupancy remained healthy in the third quarter. However, these growth levels have moderated from the earlier years. For new leases, effective rents inched up 0.9% during the quarter and 2.6% annually. Further, apartment occupancy came in at 95.5% for the third quarter across the nation’s top 100 metros.Going by numbers, per a study by the commercial real estate services’ firm, CBRE Group Inc. , the U.S. office vacancy rate declined to 12.9% in the third quarter amid growth in office-using jobs. In most of the U.S. office markets, vacancy declined, taking the national office vacancy rate close to its post-recession low.Additionally, data center REITs are experiencing a boom with the growing popularity of cloud computing, Internet of Things and big data as well as the use of third-party IT infrastructure by several companies. In fact, demand has been outpacing supply in top-tier data center markets. Despite enjoying high occupancy, these markets are absorbing new construction at a faster pace.Per the latest Earnings Preview, overall earnings for the Finance sector, of which REITs are part, are expected to be down 1.5% year over year on 1.1% higher revenues. This represents the Q3 earnings and revenue expectations for the sector as a whole — i.e. after combining the reported actual results with the still-to-come estimates.Now, let’s have a close look at the factors that will impact the above-mentioned two REITs’ third-quarter results.For Chicago, IL-based residential real estate investment trust (REIT) — Equity Residential —things do not appear to be much favorable. In fact, there is an increasing apartment supply in a number of the company’s markets. This elevated supply is likely to put pressure on rental rates and adversely affect revenue growth in the to-be-reported quarter. In addition to this, there is high concession activity amid higher supply, which remains a concern.Furthermore, the company has made strategic efforts toward repositioning the portfolio from low barrier-to-entry/non-core markets to high barrier-to-entry/core markets, and opted for substantial sale out of its portfolio in recent years.Though the assets sale might enable the company to focus exclusively on its core, high-density urban markets over the long term, the earnings-dilution impact from such a move cannot be bypassed in the near term. These issues are expected to affect the company’s net operating income in the quarter to be reported.Amid these, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is currently pegged at $619.6 million, marking estimated growth of 2.2% year over year.For third-quarter 2017, Equity Residential projects normalized funds from operations (FFO) per share in the range of 77-81 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at 79 cents.Currently, the Earnings ESP for Equity Residential is -1.04%. Also, Equity Residential’s Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) further decreases the predictive power of ESP.

The company’s diversified revenue base remains a positive. Moreover, a solid product portfolio and increasing market share are growth catalysts. The company has an aggressive acquisition strategy to supplement organic growth in storage revenues. Also, it has been investing aggressively in order to set up its data-center business.Still, Iron Mountain’s Service revenues remain modest due to declining activity rates as stored records are becoming less active. Further, the storage and information management services industry remains a highly fragmented industry with intensifying competition. In addition, the company’s highly-leveraged balance sheet remains a concern.Amid these, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is currently pegged at $962.4 million, denoting expected growth of nearly 2.1% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share is pegged at 56 cents.At present, Iron Mountain has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and an Earnings ESP of -1.35%.

118,EQR,"Prologis, Inc. (PLD  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter 2017 core funds from operations (“FFO”) per share of 67 cents, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company experienced improved operating environment in the reported quarter, but it did not recognize any promote income.In the prior-year period, Prologis had reported core FFO per share of 73 cents. Excluding promote income, the figure came in at 59 cents. Net effective rent change improved in the third quarter, but period-end occupancy was slightly down from the year-ago period.Further, this industrial real estate investment trust (REIT) narrowed its core FFO per share outlook for full-year 2017.The company generated revenues of $602.9 million, comfortably beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $570.4 million. However, the figure compared unfavorably with the year-ago tally of $704.6 million.Quarter in DetailAt the end of the third quarter, occupancy level in the company’s owned and managed portfolio was 96.3%, contracting 30 basis points (bps) year over year. Nevertheless, the occupancy in the U.S. portfolio expanded 40 bps from the prior-year quarter.During the quarter under review, Prologis signed 41 million square feet of leases in its owned and managed portfolio compared with 46 million square feet recorded in the year-ago period.Prologis' share of net effective rent change was 22.7% in the reported quarter compared with 15.0% recorded a year ago. The figure was led by the U.S. portfolio, which recorded impressive growth of 31.9%. Cash rent change was 10.6%, as against 5.7% in the year-earlier quarter.Net effective same-store net operating income (NOI) registered 4.1% growth compared with 5.6% increase reported in the comparable period last year. This was driven solely by releasing spreads and led by 6.0% growth reported in the U.S. portfolio. Cash same-store NOI climbed 6.1% compared with 6.6% reported in the year-ago period, reflecting 8.0% growth in the U.S. portfolio.In third-quarter 2017, Prologis' share of building acquisitions amounted to $20 million, development stabilization aggregated $548 million, while development starts totaled $432 million. Further, the company’s total dispositions and contributions came in at $779 million.LiquidityPrologis ended the third quarter with more than $4.0 billion of liquidity. In addition, the company reported a decrease in leverage to 23.9% on a market capitalization basis, while debt-to-adjusted EBITDA improved to 4.3x.Finally, the company exited third-quarter 2017 with cash and cash equivalents of $568.7 million, up from $271.4 million recorded at the end of the prior quarter.Outlook NarrowedPrologis narrowed its core FFO per share outlook for full-year 2017. The company now projects core FFO per share in the range of $2.79-$2.81, against $2.78–$2.82 guided earlier. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at $2.81.Our TakePrologis is well poised to benefit from its capacity to offer modern distribution facilities at strategic in-fill locations amid a continued shift toward e-commerce and supply-chain strategy transformations.

119,EQR,"Apartment Investment & Management Co. (AIV  -  Free Report), better known as Aimco, has received support from a broad coalition in the company’s appeal of the California court decision for its case against Airbnb. Particularly, the group backs Aimco’s measures to hold Airbnb legally responsible for engaging in brokering and endorsing illegal short-term rentals.Going by facts, per a December 2017 U.S. District Court ruling, Airbnb was provided ""immunity"" from liability for illegal short-term rentals brokering at Aimco’s apartment communities. This was granted on the basis of the federal Communications Decency Act (CDA) which protects online-service providers from the responsibility for the content users post.However, last month, Aimco filed its Ninth Circuit brief in the company’s appeal of the December 2017 ruling. And now the coalition has filed amicus briefs in support of Aimco’s appeal that the CDA does not offer such broad immunity to Airbnb.Among the members in the coalition, are names like National Multifamily Housing Council and the National Apartment Association; the California Apartment Association and Avalon Bay Communities; the League of California Cities, International Municipal Lawyers Association and California State Association of Counties; the American Hotel and Lodging Association; and others. All these strengthen Aimco’s appeal and raise hopes for the reconsideration of the ruling.Moreover, an amicus brief, pointing out the troubles created by Airbnb to affordable housing and stable communities, has been filed with the court by a group of New York neighborhood associations.According to Aimco's legal representative Mike Williams, ""Airbnb is a full-fledged real estate broker of illegal short-term rentals and should be held to the same level of scrutiny and accountability as a 'brick-and-mortar' broker engaged in comparable unauthorized activities.""According to Aimco and the parties supporting its appeal, rather than focusing on Airbnb’s act of publishing of property listings, the company should be held legally accountable for illegal short-term rental activities, as such doings pose a threat to the safety and quality of life of full-time residents. In fact, per the company, though prospective Aimco residents go through criminal background checks, several Airbnb customers are not thoroughly examined and are unknown trespassers. These customers not only pose a risk to safety but have also triggered disruption and damaged property at Aimco’s apartment premises.Such a support from the broader fraternity is a positive for the company. Moreover, Aimco is making diligent efforts to reposition its portfolio by shedding non-strategic properties and investing the proceeds in opportunistic acquisitions. The company’s portfolio is diversified in terms of geography and price point, and its revamping efforts have the capability to drive long-term growth.However, the dilutive impact on earnings from such asset dispositions cannot be bypassed in the near term. Also, new supply in various markets, which is affecting other residential REITs like AvalonBay Communities, Inc. (AVB  -  Free Report), Equity Residential (EQR  -  Free Report) and Essex Property Trust, Inc. (ESS  -  Free Report), is also anticipated to dampen the company’s rent growth and new-lease pricing ability. Hike in interest rate adds to its woes.Aimco currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

120,EQR,"If stellar job growth in recent months indicates more household formations and raises expectations for a robust revival of the apartment market fundamentals, then we should, perhaps, think twice.This is because per the latest report from the real estate technology and analytics firm RealPage, Inc. (RP  -  Free Report), with several markets experiencing flat rents, U.S. apartment rents have increased at an annual pace of just 2.3% as of mid-2018 — marking the slowest pace in eight years. While a mid-2018 occupancy level of 95.0% is still healthy, the deceleration in rent growth suggests that a competitive leasing environment is building up fast, and curbing landlords’ pricing power.While there was a moderation in the first quarter too, but the January-March quarter usually has a sluggish leasing period due to the cold weather that inhibits shift of households and limits growth in demand. Therefore, achieving a solid pricing power in the second quarter is significant, as otherwise, landlords find it difficult to recoup the same later in the year. This is because prior to the onset of the seasonal slowdown in leasing, pressure of filling units is more prevalent in the market than pushing rent levels north.However, during Q2 this year, the market recorded a pricing increase of 1.8%. In fact, rent growth was slower than the pace experienced during the same period in the earlier years. In the 2014-2017 period, rent growth in the April-June quarter averaged 2.3%.Furthermore, this turbulent environment is unlikely to end any time soon and offer respite, as the struggle to lure renters will definitely continue into the upcoming quarters as well, when much of new supply is expected to come on course.According to the RealPage report, the “annual pace of completions” climbed above the 300,000-unit level for four consecutive quarters. Additionally, through mid-2019, annual deliveries will keep adding on to the flow with around 300,000 units.Therefore, landlords’ ability to command more rents will most likely remain stunted and concessions might be rampant in the near term. This, again, is feared to cast a pall on residential REIT stocks like Apartment Investment & Management Co. (AIV  -  Free Report), better known as Aimco, American Homes 4 Rent (AMH  -  Free Report), AvalonBay Communities, Inc. (AVB  -  Free Report) and Equity Residential (EQR  -  Free Report).While AvalonBay and Equity Residential currently have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), Aimco and American Homes 4 Rent carry a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell), underlining downward revisions of the 2018 funds from operations (FFO) per share estimate in recent months.(You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.)Note: Anything related to earnings presented in this write-up represents funds from operations (FFO) — a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

122,EQR,"Education Realty Trust (EDR), commonly known as EdR, is making every effort to leverage on the soaring demand for on-campus development of universities. Recently, the company opened the first phase of its ONE Plan on-campus replacement housing at the Northern Michigan University (NMU).This development, named The Woods in Marquette, MI, has 417 beds in a living-learning community. The property boasts ample amenities, including Internet and Wi-Fi, classrooms, study rooms, TV lounges and laundry facilities. The entire $75.4-million project is, however, slated for final delivery in 2018. The development will include 1,229 beds.EdR is leasing the land from the university, and the project will be funded through EdR’s On Campus Equity Plan — The ONE Plan. The plan helps in funding projects on university land with this student housing REIT’s equity and financial flexibility. On the other hand, such partnerships allow the university to channelize its finances and organizational resources for other projects, and campus improvement measures.Notably, student housing REITs have decent opportunities to excel over the long term, as demand has been shooting up for on-campus developments from universities which are battling state budget cuts and low funds, and are incapable of developing or renovating the ageing housing properties. Also, on-campus housing usually enjoys full occupancy, thus ensuring steady cash flow for the student housing REIT.EdR is one of the largest developer, owner and manager of student housing communities in the nation. In 2017, the company is set to deliver third-party developments worth nearly $100 million, adding around $300 million to its own asset portfolio.In sync with its efforts to capitalize on the growing demand for on-campus facilities, recently, EdR announced the completion and unveiling of Sycamore Suites, the new on-campus residence hall of East Stroudsburg University of Pennsylvania. The newly opened hall encloses two- and four-person suites, accommodating 496 beds.

Hence, such real estates are generally required to be set up within or in places close to colleges and universities. Also, enrolment growth is a major driver for student housing assets.However, shares of the company have lost 9.4%, while the industry has recorded growth of 7.6%, year to date.EdR currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

123,EQR,"A smart beta exchange traded fund, the SPDR Russell 1000 Low Volatility Focus ETF (ONEV  -  Free Report) debuted on 12/02/2015, and offers broad exposure to the Large Cap ETFs category of the U.S. equity market.What Are Smart Beta ETFs?The ETF industry has long been dominated by products based on market cap weighted indexes, a strategy created to reflect the market or a particular market segment.Investors who believe in market efficiency should consider market cap indexes, as they replicate market returns in a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way.On the other hand, some investors who believe that it is possible to beat the market by superior stock selection opt to invest in another class of funds that track non-cap weighted strategies--popularly known as smart beta.By attempting to pick stocks that have a better chance of risk-return performance, non-cap weighted indexes are based on certain fundamental characteristics, or a combination of such.This area offers many different investment choices, such as simplest equal-weighting, fundamental weighting and volatility/momentum based weighting methodologies; however, not all of these strategies can deliver superior results.Fund Sponsor & IndexThe fund is managed by State Street Global Advisors. ONEV has been able to amass assets over $450.81 M, making it one of the average sized ETFs in the Large Cap ETFs. ONEV, before fees and expenses, seeks to match the performance of the Russell 1000 Low Volatility Focused Factor Index.The Russell 1000 Low Volatility Focused Factor Index reflects the performance of a segment of large-capitalization U.S. equity securities demonstrating a combination of core factors high value, high quality, and low size characteristics, with a focus factor comprising low volatility characteristics.Cost & Other ExpensesSince cheaper funds tend to produce better results than more expensive funds, assuming all other factors remain equal, it is important for investors to pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio.Operating expenses on an annual basis are 0.20% for ONEV, making it one of the cheaper products in the space.ONEV's 12-month trailing dividend yield is 1.88%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsIt is important to delve into an ETF's holdings before investing despite the many upsides to these kinds of funds like diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.Representing 18.50% of the portfolio, the fund has heaviest allocation to the Consumer Discretionary sector; Industrials and Financials round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Baxter International Inc. (BAX  -  Free Report) accounts for about 1.11% of total assets, followed by Sysco Corporation (SYY  -  Free Report) and Equity Residential (EQR  -  Free Report).ONEV's top 10 holdings account for about 9.1% of its total assets under management.Performance and RiskSo far this year, the ETF has lost about -0.22%, and was up about 11.94% in the last one year (as of 05/24/2018). ONEV has traded between $69.37 and $76.42 in the past 52-week period.The ETF has a beta of 0.98 and standard deviation of 11.29% for the trailing three-year period. With about 420 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesSPDR Russell 1000 Low Volatility Focus ETF is a reasonable option for investors seeking to outperform the Large Cap ETFs segment of the market. However, there are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider.IShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV  -  Free Report) tracks S&P 500 Index and the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY  -  Free Report) tracks S&P 500 Index. IShares Core S&P 500 ETF has $147.45 B in assets, SPDR S&P 500 ETF has $260.79 B. IVV has an expense ratio of 0.04% and SPY charges 0.09%.Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Large Cap ETFs.Bottom LineTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.

124,EQR,"Equity Residential (EQR  -  Free Report) reported first-quarter 2018 normalized funds from operations (FFO) per share of 77 cents, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 78 cents by a whisker.Per management, although the nation’s coastal, gateway cities are witnessing strong rental housing demand, growth in new lease rates continues to be dampened by new apartment supply.However, normalized FFO per share figure came in higher than 74 cents reported in the year-ago quarter. Results mirror enhanced same-store net operating income (NOI) and lease-up NOI.

125,EQR,"Equity Residential (EQR  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results after the market closes on Apr 24. The company is expected to experience growth in both revenues and funds from operations (FFO) per share in the quarter.Last quarter, this Chicago, IL-based residential real estate investment trust (REIT) delivered a better-than-expected performance in terms of FFO per share. Results mirrored enhanced same-store and lease-up net operating income (NOI). However, the company incurred higher corporate overhead in the quarter.Over the trailing four quarters, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two occasions and met in the other two, delivering an average positive surprise of around 0.9%. The graph below depicts this surprise history:Equity Residential Price and EPS Surprise  Equity Residential Price and EPS Surprise | Equity Residential QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for Equity Residential prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayEquity Residential has been making concerted efforts to reposition its portfolio in high barrier-to-entry/core markets. The company's current focus is on the acquisition and development of assets primarily in six core coastal metropolitan areas — Boston, New York, Washington D.C., Southern California (including Los Angeles, Orange County and San Diego), San Francisco and Seattle.Moreover, the home ownership cost in most markets of Equity Residential is significantly higher than the national average. Considering the current macroeconomic environment, such a trend is expected to continue, which in turn, would drive demand for rented apartments.Further, corporate profits are up, and corporate tax cuts are encouraging companies to deploy capital and increase wages. As such, consumer confidence is high, driven by job growth and rising wages, promising solid prospects for Equity Residential. In addition, favorable demographics, lifestyle transformation and creation of new households amid improving economy will further accelerate demand for the company’s properties.Amid these, Equity Residential projects normalized FFO per share of 74-78 cents for first-quarter 2018. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at 78 cents, which denotes a projected increase of 5.4% year over year. Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s revenues is pegged at $631.3 million, reflecting expected growth of 4.5% year over year.However, the latest report from the real estate technology and analytics firm — RealPage, Inc. (RP  -  Free Report) — states that the national apartment market moderated in first-quarter 2018, with occupancy shrinking slightly and rent growth slowing down. Nevertheless, the first quarter marks a slow leasing period, thanks to the cold weather that inhibits shift of households and limits growth in demand.Going by statistics, the annual rent growth shrunk to 2.3% in Q1. This marked moderation from the 2.6-2.9% growth rate experienced throughout 2017. Occupancy level of 94.5% this March edged down from the prior-year tally of 95%, with metros having subdued construction activity faring well and recording the strongest occupancy. Nevertheless, the overall occupancy level is still healthy.Moreover, there is an increasing apartment supply in a number of the company’s markets. This high supply is likely to put pressure on rental rates in the to-be-reported quarter. In addition, there is high concession activity amid elevated supply, which remains a concern.Furthermore, the company’s activities during the quarter were inadequate to gain analysts’ confidence. Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Equity Residential has the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Equity Residential is +0.25%.Zacks Rank: Equity Residential carries a Zacks Rank of 3.A positive Earnings ESP is a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely beat in terms of FFO per share.

126,EQR,"Education Realty Trust (EDR  -  Free Report) announced the delivery of Lewis Hall Honors College and University Flats to the University of Kentucky, completing the extensive on-campus revitalization development.University Flats will house graduate, professional and upper-level undergraduate students in separate living communities. The seven-story building encloses 771 beds in 312 apartments. These constructions range from studio formats to four-bedroom apartments. Each apartment has a kitchen and is well furnished.On the other hand, the compounds of Lewis Honors College will accommodate 350 students to foster a live-learn environment. With the university’s top-tier students housed in it, the compound can stand out as a learning hub.In 2011, the University of Kentucky entered into a partnership with Education Realty Trust to construct, finance and manage its on-campus housing revitalization program. The company constructed approximately 200 learning spaces and 6,850 new beds to create a progressive campus.According to Eric N. Monday, the university's executive vice president for finance and administration, these housing compounds will focus on the success of students ‘through modern, technology-rich living spaces that foster a sense of community’.This project has improved the recruiting and retention rates for the university, in addition to student success. The project, worth $450 million, has been executed in five phases. It was entirely funded through Education Realty’s On-Campus Equity Plan – The ONE PlanSM – giving the university access to a single trusted partner. While Education Realty has been given a long-term lease to maintain and manage these communities, the university will provide residential life for the remaining part of the 75-year ground lease.Unlike residential REITs, including AvalonBay Communities, Inc. (AVB  -  Free Report), Equity Residential (EQR  -  Free Report) and Equity Lifestyle Properties, Inc (ELS  -  Free Report), whose rental units are open for leasing to all, student housing REITs lease their real estates to students. Hence, such real estates are generally required to be set up within or in places close to colleges and universities, and usually enjoy full occupancy.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

127,EQR,"Vident Financial launched a new fund on Mar 27, focused on providing exposure to the real estate space of the United States equity market.U.S. Diversified Real Estate ETF (PPTY  -  Free Report) seeks to track, before fees and expenses, the performance of the U.S. Diversified Real Estate Index.Fund CharacteristicsThe fund’s index seeks to employ a rules based approach to offer investors a multi-factor alternative to traditional market cap-weighted real estate funds. “If you ask for the three most important factors when investing in real estate, you’ll probably hear ‘location, location, location.’ To this we’d add property type and leverage,” per a Business Wire article citing Fred Stoops, head of real estate investments at Vident.The fund amassed $9 million in AUM within a few days of trading. It charges a fee of 53 basis points a year.  The fund’s top three holdings include Equity Residential (EQR  -  Free Report), Avalonbay Communities Inc (AVB  -  Free Report) and Terreno Realty Corp (TRNO  -  Free Report), with 3.8%, 3.4% and 3.0% exposure, respectively.How Does it Fit in a Portfolio?The Real Estate segment of the U.S. market has played an integral role in the expansion of the U.S. economy. Although it requires immense knowledge about the sector and bears significant risks, equity funds providing exposure to the sector are a great way to diversify traditional portfolios.  Owing to its low correlation with other asset classes, the real estate sector is a great diversifier. Moreover, real estate investments are a great way to gain inflation protection, as rising prices increase the resale value of the property and it can also be used to generate rental income.   CompetitionThe fund faces intense competition. Below we discuss a few ETFs that seek to provide exposure to the real estate sector.iShares U.S. Real Estate ETF (IYR  -  Free Report)This fund seeks to provide exposure to real estate stocks and tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Real Estate Index. It has AUM of $3.7 billion and charges a fee of 44 basis points a year.The fund’s top three holdings are American Tower Reit Corp (AMT  -  Free Report), Simon Property Group Reit Inc (SPG  -  Free Report) and Crown Castle International Reit Co (CCI  -  Free Report) with 6.3%, 4.8% and 4.5% allocation, respectively. The fund has lost 1.4% in a year and 6.5% year to date.Real Estate Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLRE  -  Free Report)This fund seeks to provide exposure to real estate stocks and tracks the Real Estate Select Sector Index.

128,EQR,"In the recently-issued operating update for the first quarter of 2018, AvalonBay Communities, Inc. (AVB  -  Free Report) stated that it expects total rental revenues for established communities to be up 2.3–2.4% year over year.Notably, in the prior quarter, the company had reported 2.2% growth in total revenues for established communities. Results indicated increase in average rental rates and economic occupancy. Specifically, for fourth-quarter 2017, average rental rates were up 2.1% year over year, while economic occupancy inched up 0.1% from the year-ago quarter.AvalonBay has high quality assets located in some of the premium markets of the country, which enable the company to generate steady rental revenues. In fact, the company delivered the seventh consecutive year of above-sector average core funds from operations (FFO) per share growth, which is encouraging. Based on its strong fundamentals, we expect this uptrend to continue. Increasing consumer confidence on the back of job growth, rising wages and a healthier balance sheet promise bright prospects for AvalonBay.However, new apartment deliveries are anticipated to remain elevated in the near term and this has emerged as a pressing concern for the residential REITs, including AvalonBay, Equity Residential (EQR  -  Free Report), Apartment Investment & Management Co. (AIV  -  Free Report) and Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. (MAA  -  Free Report).Particularly, for AvalonBay, considering the regions, deliveries are projected to increase in both Southern California and the Pacific Northwest. Additionally, supply continues to be most noticeable in the urban submarkets. This high supply in a number of the company’s markets is likely to put pressure on rental rates. Hence, growth in its stabilized portfolio might remain modest in the upcoming period. Furthermore, there is high concession activity amid elevated supply, which remains a concern.Currently, AvalonBay has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The stock has depreciated 13.0% over the past three months, underperforming the 12.1% loss incurred by the industry it belongs to.Note: FFO, a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs, is obtained after adding depreciation and amortization and other non-cash expenses to net income.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

129,EQR,"The U.S. apartment supply remains elevated and there seems to be no respite any time soon. While fourth-quarter 2017 was earlier projected to be the peak period for deliveries, delays stemming from labor shortage and escalating costs continue to push the delivery schedule to 2018.According to the apartment pipeline data from Axiometrics, a RealPage Inc. (RP  -  Free Report) company, for an estimated 56,186 units, delivery has been postponed to the next year, up from 50,658 units delayed from 2016 to 2017, and 14,805 units from 2015 to 2016. Particularly, the numbers of projects, the completion dates of which are changing to 2018 from 2017, are escalating “week by week, month by month.”The delayed figure has been based on a formula using prior year’s delay percentage as a base. Particularly, Dallas, New York and Houston are slated to have “most units delayed into 2018.” These are also the metros with the maximum marked supply for 2017, per that report.Moreover, data, as of Sep 18, suggests expected deliveries of around 370,582 new units for full-year 2017, reflecting a decline of about 11,655 units from the Aug 21 projections. This reveals a shift of deliveries to 2018. Along with new construction starts, identified supply for 2018 climbed 16,729 units and has now reached 298,068 units.This could cast a pall on residential REIT stocks like AvalonBay Communities, Inc. (AVB  -  Free Report), Equity Residential (EQR  -  Free Report) and Essex Property Trust Inc. (ESS  -  Free Report). In fact, performance of residential REITs over the last few quarters has already been affected by elevated level of supply of new units. Now, the anticipation of a continuation of the stressed environment into 2018 is also likely to impact the occupancy levels, as well as landlords’ ability to command more rents and concession levels.In addition, with some of the residential REITs’ development deliveries running behind schedule amid a delay in construction activities, lease-up net operating income is expected to be adversely affected in the near term.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

130,EQR,"After reporting record prices in 2017, U.S. homebuilding has started 2018 on a high. U.S. homebuilding paced to a 15-month high in January, primarily due to a sharp rise in construction of apartments according to government data released last Friday. In fact, the rise was driven by a 19.7% surge in apartment construction.On the other hand, single-family homes started increased a meager 3.7% from December. The surge in homebuilding is being credited to strong economic fundamentals supported by impressive job data and higher wages. This in turn is also likely to quicken the pace of rate hikes, which could boost the rate spread for REITs from the sector.Shift Toward Multifamily Dwellings Historically, Americans have shown an inclination toward single-family homes. However, the scenario has witnessed a sea change post recession, with people opting for multifamily apartments in the absence of sufficient funds.The changing trend triggered a rise in construction of multifamily apartments, peaking on stepped up activity in the New York metropolitan area between 2010 and 2015, when the recovery was in its early stages. The increase continued in 2016, as other major metropolitan areas too witnessed a surge in activity.  Recovery Prompts Growth in Single Family HomesHowever, with the economy recovering, multifamily apartments started witnessing a decline. The downtrend was palpable in 2017, when multifamily apartment starts were lesser than 2016, per Dodge Data & Analytics.According to Robert A. Murray, chief economist for Dodge Data & Analytics, the scenario changed in 2017, as markets such as Los Angeles, Dallas-Ft. Worth, TX and Washington DC retreated from the levels posted during 2016. Going by national volumes, multifamily and commercial starts were worth $194.7 billion, down 7% from 2016. However, it was still 8% above the amount reported for 2015.Does this mean that demand for single-family homes has increased? Going just by prices, per National Association of Realtors (NAR), average cost of an existing single-family home in the fourth quarter was $247,800, up 5.3% from the prior-year quarter of $235,400. Moreover, November 2017 witnessed a 17.5% rise in sale of newly constructed single-family homes, the highest pace since July 2007.That said, demand for multifamily apartments may not have really gone down. According to National Multifamily Housing Council’s latest research report, demand for apartments in the United States is rising and country will witness an additional demand for 4.6 million apartments by 2030. If that is the scenario, U.S. homebuilders are well on track. Multifamily apartment starts may have witnessed a decline in 2017 from 2016, but it necessarily may not be because of a shift toward single-family homes.According to data released by the Commerce Department last Friday, total housing starts surged 9.7% in January to an annual rate of 1.3 million units. This is the highest level recorded since October 2016 and the largest increase in 13 months.It has been observed that multifamily housing is attracting real estate investors primarily because of demographic changes. An increasing number of both young and older Americans are going for rented apartments than buying homes. Moreover, monthly rental prices are not increasing much. Per real estate research firm Yardi Matrix, national average rent was $1361 in January 2018, 2.8% higher year over year but flat month over month. However, this is nothing compared with the 5.1% increase in monthly rent prices witnessed in 2014. This is perhaps because of an overall increase in apartment construction.Can Multifamiy REITs Recover in 2018?Of course, the fate of REITs related to the sector has been quite different. Long-term quantitative easing had compressed the rate spread, which this sector depends on to generate income. As a result, stocks such as Camden Property Trust (CPT  -  Free Report), Armada Hoffler Properties, Inc. (AHH  -  Free Report), Apartment Investment and Management Company (AIV  -  Free Report) and Equity Residential (EQR  -  Free Report) are down 10.4%, 10%, -10.1% and 15% over the last three months. Each of these stocks carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The situation is likely to change radically in 2018. Three rate hikes are already scheduled for the current year. Further, the recent jump in yearly wage increases is likely to provide the much-needed thrust to sluggish inflation levels. This in turn could lead to a quickening in the pace of rate hikes, which could boost the rate spread of REITs. Given this backdrop, it is likely that they have a much better year ahead.Further, a booming economy is likely to boost rents and demand for apartments. This will also increase fund from operation levels that will offset higher interest costs and boost REIT prices.Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio?Earlier this month, credit bureau Equifax announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of every 3 Americans.

131,EQR,"Residential real estate investment trust (REIT) Essex Property Trust Inc. (ESS  -  Free Report) delivered an in-line performance for fourth-quarter 2017. The company reported core funds from operations (FFO) per share of $3.01 for the quarter, meeting the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Core FFO per share improved 7.1% from the year-ago quarter figure of $2.81.Results reflect solid growth in net operating income (NOI) and high occupancy level.Total revenues of $345.1 million in the quarter grew 4.9% year over year. However, the figure narrowly missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $346.5 million.In 2018, management expects housing demand to surpass supply in coastal markets of California and Washington. This is likely to result in growth in market rent close to long-term averages. Specifically, West Coast is anticipated to outdo the nation both in terms of rent growth as well as job growth in the year.For full-year 2017, core FFO per share came in at $11.91, 7.9% ahead of the prior-year tally of $11.04. This was backed by 5.4% year-over-year growth in total revenues to $1.4 billion.Following the earnings release on Feb 7, shares of Essex Property rallied 4.7% and closed at $227.94 on Feb 9.Quarter in DetailDuring the reported quarter, Essex Property’s same-property gross revenues grew 3.0% from the prior-year quarter, while same-property net operating income (NOI) improved 3.4% year over year. Financial occupancies of 96.8% expanded 20 basis points (bps) year over year.Further, the company sold two communities for a total contract price of $160.3 million during the quarter. On the other hand, the company acquired one community for a total contract price of $59.0 million.LiquidityEssex Property exited year-end 2017 with cash and cash equivalents, including restricted cash, of $61.1 million, down from $170.3 million at the end of 2016.Notably, in January 2018, the company made an amendment to its unsecured line of credit facility, thereby enhancing the maximum amount available for borrowing from $1.0 billion to $1.2 billion as well as lengthening the maturity to December 2021. As of Feb 2, 2018, the company had around $891.0 million in undrawn capacity on its unsecured credit facilities.During the fourth quarter, the company issued 33,571 shares of common stock at an average price of $261.19 through its equity distribution program for net proceeds of $8.7 million. For full year 2017, the company issued 345,444 shares of common stock at an average price of $260.38. This helped generate net proceeds of $89.1 million.OutlookEssex Property provided its guidance for first-quarter and full-year 2018. For the full year, the company projects core FFO per share in the range of $12.24- $12.64. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at $12.42.The full-year 2018 projection is backed by expectations for same-property revenue growth in the band of 2.0-3.0% and same-property NOI increase in the range of 1.6-3.4%.For first-quarter 2018, the company projects core FFO per share in the $2.99-$3.09 band. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at $3.05.ConclusionWe are encouraged with the better-than-expected performance in terms of FFO per share of Essex Property in the reported quarter but slightly disappointed with the revenue miss. With a strong property base and solid balance sheet, Essex Property is likely to leverage on favorable demographic trends in its markets. The company’s substantial exposure to the West Coast market, which is home to several innovation and technology companies, offers ample scope to boost its top line over the long term. However, elevated apartment deliveries remain a concern. Also, rate hike add to its woes.Essex Property currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The company reported core funds from operations (“FFO”) per share of $2.97 for the quarter, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.92.

The company has also raised its outlook for full-year 2017.Total revenue of $339.1 million in the quarter exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $336.2 million and was up 5.4% year over year.Per the management, during the second quarter, the market environment was “more favorable than expected”, especially in Seattle and Northern California. This was partly due to the delay in the delivery of new apartments. However, “periodic disruption from large concessions” is expected to continue when a number of “competing apartment communities are simultaneously in lease-up within the same submarket”. Amid this, for the next few years, management anticipates rental growth in core coastal markets to “trend near long-term averages”.Essex Property Trust, Inc.

As of Jul 24, 2017, the company had $1.025 billion in undrawn capacity on its unsecured credit facilities.During the second quarter, the company issued 311,873 shares of common stock through its equity distribution program at an average price of $260.30. This helped in the generation of net proceeds of $80.6 million.OutlookEssex Property raised its guidance for 2017. The company projects core FFO per share in the range of $11.70–$11.96 from $11.56–$11.96 guided earlier, denoting an increase of 7 cents at the mid-point.

137,EQR,"Equity Residential (EQR  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter 2017 results after the market closes on Jan 30.Last quarter, this Chicago, IL-based residential real estate investment trust (REIT) delivered a better-than-expected performance in terms of funds from operations (FFO) per share. Results mirrored enhanced same-store and lease-up net operating income (NOI). However, the company experienced adverse impact on NOI, primarily stemming from its 2016 and 2017 transaction activity. Also, it incurred elevated interest expenses and higher corporate overhead in the quarter.Over the trailing four quarters, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in one occasion and met in the rest three. It delivered an average positive surprise of around 0.3% during this period. The graph below depicts this surprise history:Equity Residential Price and EPS Surprise  Equity Residential Price and EPS Surprise | Equity Residential QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for Equity Residential prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderPer a study by the real estate technology and analytics firm, RealPage, Inc. (RP  -  Free Report), the U.S. apartment market reported moderate rent growth for the calendar year and seasonal pricing cuts in the fourth quarter. While U.S. apartment rents increased at a modest rate of 2.5% in 2017, effective rents for new leases fell 0.9% during the quarter. Admittedly, the levels of rent growth have moderated from the earlier years. However, national apartment occupancy came in at 95.1% at the end of fourth-quarter 2017, remaining stable year over year.For Equity Residential, things appear mixed in the to-be-reported quarter. The company is making concerted efforts to reposition its portfolio in high barrier-to-entry/core markets. It is anticipated to benefit from favorable demographics, lifestyle transformation and creation of new households. In fact, the company’s FFO per share performance is likely to benefit from solid lease-up NOI as well as elevated NOI from its 2017 acquisition activity.However, there is an increasing apartment supply in a number of the company’s markets. This high supply is likely to put pressure on rental rates and adversely affect revenue growth in the to-be-reported quarter. In addition, there is high concession activity amid higher supply, which remains a concern.For fourth-quarter 2017, Equity Residential projects normalized FFO per share in the range of 79-83 cents.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at 81 cents.Equity Residential’s activities during the quarter failed to gain analysts’ confidence. Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 60 days.Additionally, over the past three months, shares of Equity Residential have declined 6.5%, underperforming its industry’s descend of 6.0%.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Equity Residential is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a bullish Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Equity Residential has an Earnings ESP of -0.55%, representing the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Equity Residential’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few stocks in the REIT space that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to report a positive surprise this time around:CubeSmart (CUBE  -  Free Report), slated to release fourth-quarter results on Feb 15, has an Earnings ESP of +1.10% and a Zacks Rank #3.

138,EQR,"Equity Residential’s (EQR  -  Free Report) efforts to reposition its portfolio in high barrier-to-entry markets amid favorable demographic trends will stoke growth. However, elevated level of new supply across its markets is anticipated to adversely affect revenue growth in the coming quarters.In fact, this multi-family real estate investment trust (REIT) is currently focusing on concentrating its footprint in the high-density suburban coastal gateway markets in close proximity to public transportation, dining and education facilities. Such strategic locations will enable the company to enjoy higher demand at its properties.  Further, high home ownership cost in most markets of Equity Residential relative to the national average has also driven demand for rental apartments. As this trend is likely to continue, we anticipate demand for the company’s properties to keep rising.Equity Residential has a return on equity (ROE) of 7.22%, significantly higher than the industry’s average of 2.78%. This highlights the company’s ability to raise shareholder value and the optimal utilization of equity.In fact, in 2016, using proceeds from property sales, the company paid its shareholders’ special dividend of around $4 billion, or $11 per share. Also, the average 10-year dividend yield for Equity Residential is 3.7%. Such moves boost investors’ confidence in the stock.However, new supply across Equity Residential’s markets remains a concern. This elevated supply is likely to put pressure on rental rates and mar revenue growth. Further, high concession activity amid rising supply also crushes the company’s profitability.Also, the company has opted for substantial sale out of its portfolio in recent times. Its sale of the Starwood portfolio, together with the other 2016 dispositions, resulted in the company's exit from the South Florida, Denver and New England (excluding Boston) markets. While non-core asset disposition would assist the company focus exclusively on high-density suburban coastal gateway markets, the earnings-dilution impact from such a move might be difficult to avoid in the near term.Moreover, shares of the company have underperformed its industry, in the year so far. While the stock has edged down 0.2%, the industry has recorded growth of 1% during this period.Equity Residential currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Better-ranked stocks in the REIT space include Franklin Street Properties (FSP  -  Free Report), Columbia Property Trust (CXP  -  Free Report) and BRT Realty Trust (BRT  -  Free Report).

The company has achieved 12 consecutive years of internal growth in same-store rental rate, rental revenues, and net operating income, as well as 51 consecutive quarters of same-store revenue growth.Unlike residential REITs, including AvalonBay Communities, Inc. (AVB  -  Free Report) and Equity Residential (EQR  -  Free Report), rental units of which are open for leasing to all, student housing REITs like American Campus Communities and Education Realty Trust (EDR  -  Free Report), which is better known as EdR, lease their real estates to students. Hence, such real estates are generally required to be set up within or in places close to colleges and universities. Also, enrolment growth is a major driver for student housing assets.Moreover, with a $24,000 salary differential between college graduates and high-school graduates, college enrolment is set to increase and this will drive demand for residential units that are leased by student housing REITs. Also, there is pent-up demand for new, purpose-built student housing properties which have better amenities than old, outdated housing. Further, supply remains manageable.Apart from these, student housing REITs have decent opportunities to excel in the coming years as demand is emanating for on-campus developments from universities that are facing state budget cuts and low funds, and are incapable of developing or renovating the aging housing properties. And on-campus housing usually enjoys full occupancy.Shares of American Campus Communities have outperformed the industry it belongs to, in the past month.

140,EQR,"Equity Residential (EQR  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter 2017 results after the market closes on Jul 25.Last quarter, this Chicago, IL-based residential real estate investment trust (“REIT”) delivered an in-line result. Results reflected enhanced same-store net operating income (NOI) and lease-up NOI. In addition, the company experienced lower corporate overhead. However, the positive was offset by adverse impact on NOI, primarily stemming from the company’s 2016 huge disposition activity.Moreover, the company met estimates in three occasions and missed in the other, over the trailing four quarters. This resulted in an average negative surprise of 0.33%. The graph below depicts the surprise history of the company.Equity Residential Price and EPS Surprise  Equity Residential Price and EPS Surprise | Equity Residential QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for Equity Residential prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderEquity Residential is poised to benefit from its portfolio-repositioning efforts, household growth, favorable demographics, lifestyle transformation and low unemployment. The company made concerted efforts toward repositioning the portfolio from low barrier-to-entry/non-core markets to high barrier-to-entry/core markets, and opted for substantial sale out of its portfolio in 2016.The company’s current focus is on the acquisition and development of assets mainly in six core coastal metropolitan areas – Boston, New York, Washington D.C., Southern California (including Los Angeles, Orange County and San Diego), San Francisco and Seattle.  Also, there is solid rental demand through the nation’s coastal, gateway cities. As such, its performance in the to-be-reported quarter is likely to reflect positive impact from same-store and lease up NOI.However, there is increasing new apartment supply in a number of the company’s markets. Amid this, pressure on new lease rates is expected to continue, while concession activity is anticipated to remain elevated.In addition, though the assets sale might enable the company focus exclusively on its core, high-density urban markets over the long term, the earnings dilution impact from such a move cannot be bypassed in the near term. These issues are anticipated to affect the company’s net operating income in the quarter to be reported.For second-quarter 2017, Equity Residential projects normalized funds from operations (“FFO”) per share in the range of 75–79 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at 77 cents.Equity Residential’s activities during the quarter failed to gain analysts’ confidence. Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Further, year-to-date, shares of Equity Residential underperformed the Zacks categorized REIT and Equity Trust – Residential industry. The company’s shares logged in a return of 4.4%, against 6.3% growth of the industry.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Equity Residential will likely beat on estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.Conversely, we caution against stocks with Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few stocks in the REIT sector that you may want to consider, as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to report a positive surprise this quarter:Liberty Property Trust (LPT  -  Free Report), slated to release second-quarter results on Jul 25, has an Earnings ESP of +1.61% and a Zacks Rank #2.

143,EQR,"The U.S. apartment supply remains elevated, with fourth-quarter 2017 projected to be the peak period for deliveries. However, delays resulting from labor shortage and escalating costs could push the peak season to first-quarter 2018, as expected completion dates of a number of projects are changing to early 2018 from late 2017.Per the apartment pipeline data from Axiometrics, a RealPage Inc. (RP  -  Free Report) company, the Houston market is likely to experience a significant decline in new units in 2018, while Dallas, Atlanta, Denver and Austin markets are anticipated to see a moderation in supply. However, the Washington, DC and Los Angeles markets are likely to witness upswing in construction, while new units in New York and Seattle markets are expected to hover near the 2017 levels.This could cast a pall on residential REIT stocks like AvalonBay Communities, Inc. (AVB  -  Free Report), Equity Residential (EQR  -  Free Report) and Essex Property Trust Inc. (ESS  -  Free Report).Notably, the delay in deliveries has been quite evident in the last few quarters. In fact, per a recent report from Axiometrics, 103,861 new units are marked for delivery in the third quarter, while 117,866 new units are projected to be up in the market in the fourth quarter, according to the survey as of Aug 21. This is in contrast to the data as of May 22, which estimated delivery of 112,856 units in the third quarter and 109,333 in the fourth.The figures clearly illustrate a decrease of around 9,000 units in the third-quarter schedule, thanks to the delays, and an addition of around 8,500 units to the fourth-quarter roster. The third- and fourth-quarter new unit numbers are also higher than the projections in the first of the year, when they were estimated to be 73,748 in the third quarter and 65,688 in the fourth quarter.Moreover, data as of Aug 21 suggests expected deliveries of around 381,237 new units for full-year 2017, reflecting a decline of about 13,300 units from the May 22 projections. This reveals a shift of deliveries to 2018. Along with new construction starts, identified supply for 2018 climbed and has now reached 281,139 units. Although the figure is below the anticipated volume of 2017, it is fast reaching the 2016 aggregate, and has exceeded the 2015 and 2014 tallies.Elevated supply has already affected the performance of residential REITs over the last few quarters. The anticipation of a stressed environment in the near term is also likely to affect their ability to command more rents and concession levels. Further, with some of the residential REITs’ development deliveries running behind schedule amid a delay in construction activities, lease-up net operating income is expected to be adversely affected in the near term.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.
