57,SWK,"Over the last three months, the top-performing mutual funds have continued to pick up shares in chip stocks like Applied Materials (AMAT) and Intel (INTC), as well as in building-related companies, including Thor Industries (THO), Pulte Group (PHM) and Stanley Black & Decker (SWK).XWith an eye toward the growth of industrial output, leading fund managers also invested in five chemical companies, including DowDuPont (DWDP), Sherwin-Williams (SHW) and plastics manufacturer Rogers (ROG).Fifty-one leading mutual funds also took a nearly $128 million gulp of energy drink leader Monster Beverage (MNST), which cleared a 57.35 buy point on, quite appropriately, Halloween.  The Coca-Cola (KO) partner is trading 1% above the entry, meaning it's still in the buy zone, which extends to 60.22.Monster sports a B+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating and five quarters of rising fund ownership. The maker of Monster Rehab and other drink brands is set to report Q3 earnings on Nov. 8, with analysts expecting 21% EPS growth. Note that it's risky to buy any stock just before it reports.DowDuPont received the biggest investment of any stock on the list, as 73 funds purchased $16.7 billion worth of shares. But that number is skewed by the merger of Dow Chemical Co. and E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co. that was just completed in September to create the new entity. The chemical giant's market cap stands at just over $88 billion, and the stock has eased back into the buy zone after become extended from a breakout in September.Forty-two funds invested just over $1.7 billion in leading chip stock Intel, which broke out on Oct. 2, then soared over 7% on Oct. 27 after reporting third-quarter earnings. Intel is now about 22% above the initial buy point.UnitedHealth (UNH) was the only other company to join the billion-dollar club, with 67 funds investing $1.2 billion.  The megacap managed-care stock has continued to climb since a breakout in March 2016, clearly boosted by seven quarters of rising fund ownership.Semiconductor stocks like IBD 50 members Applied Materials and Lam Research (LRCX) have been on a tear since the beginning of 2016, but it's a cyclical industry, so investors should be ready to lock in gains if the stocks begin to show topping action.In addition to Applied Materials, Lam Research, IBD Big Cap 20 stock Texas Instruments (TXN) and Intel, six more semiconductor-related companies made this month's list, a sign that institutional investors are continuing to put their chips on the table, so to speak.

63,SWK,"Sears Holdings (SHLD) shot up Thursday after announcing that it is selling Kenmore appliances via Amazon.com (AMZN), including Alexa-enabled smart appliances, a team-up that comes after years of struggle to compete against the e-commerce giant.XBut the news also triggered a broad sell-off in home improvement chains Home Depot (HD) and Lowe's (LOW), along with Best Buy (BBY). All three are big sellers of appliances.""This marks the broadest distribution of Kenmore, America's most trusted home appliance brand, outside of Sears branded stores and related online retail platforms,"" Sears said in a statement. Terms of the deal weren't disclosed.The move follows Sears' deal in January to sell its Craftsman line of tools to Stanley Black & Decker (SWK) and comes amid questions about Sears' future, after warnings earlier this year about its ability to continue as a going concern.Meanwhile, Amazon is expanding its reach in traditional brick-and-mortar retail and agreed to acquire Whole Foods Market (WFM) last month.Sears shares were up 10.6% to 9.60 in the stock market today, near session lows after spiking to 10.76 in the morning.

Lowe's dived 5.6%, plunging through its 200-day line to a six-month low. Home improvement chains had been seen as Amazon-proof, or at least-resistant, but the e-commerce giant's reach continues to expand.Electronics retailer Best Buy lost 3.9% to 53.96. Best Buy was hit earlier this month on news that Amazon is setting up a nascent rival to Geek Squad.Appliance maker Whirlpool (WHR) lost 3.4%.The Sears-Amazon deal follows news late last month that athletic apparel giant Nike (NKE) would sell directly on Amazon's site. Nike shares spiked on that news, along with a solid earnings report.As they try to adapt to an increasingly connected form of shopping, retailers like Sears, Macy's (M) and J.C. Penney (JCP) have struggled to match the online convenience provided by Amazon. The danger posed by the e-commerce giant has escalated as it moves further into fashion and furniture.Value retail chains like TJX (TJX), Burlington Stores (BURL) and Ross Stores (ROST) also threaten the department stores' sales and traffic.Kenmore Smart connected room air conditioners, integrated with Alexa, are now available, with plans to expand the full product line onto Amazon. Kenmore, Sears Home Services and Innovel Solutions will provide delivery, installation, and other extended warranties.The collaboration with Amazon is ""perfectly aligned with our omni-channel strategy,"" said Tom Park, president of the Kenmore, Craftsman and DieHard brands at Sears.""This collaboration is the first of its kind for Kenmore,"" he said in the announcement, ""broadening its accessibility to the next generation of American families outside of Sears branded retail channels.""CFRA analyst Efraim Levy wrote that news of the Amazon-Sears deal could ""slow or even reverse some appliance market share gains"" for Home Depot and Lowe's, as he believes the home-improvement retailers have gained from Sears' loss of customers.But he said he still believed Home Depot and Lowe's were ""Amazon-resistant,"" given their customer assistance and growing focus on professional customers.RELATED:Nike Breaks Out As Analyst Sees Accelerating Growth

65,SWK,"Sears Holdings (SHLD) shares soared Friday after the department store operator said it is could sell more real estate and more brands as it looks to cut $1 billion in costs this year.Sears announced a restructuring plan to ""to reduce our corporate overhead, more closely integrate our Sears and Kmart operations and improve our merchandising, supply chain and inventory management,"" according to a statement.The plan includes closing 108 Kmart and 42 Sears stores, which was announced last month. Sears is also considering selling its Kenmore washer and dryer and DieHard car battery businesses. Last month, Sears sold its Craftsman brand tool line to Stanley Black & Decker (SWK) for $900 million.Sears shares jumped 25.6% to close at 6.96 on the stock market today, but finished below the 7.75 intraday high. The stock hit 5.50 on Wednesday, its lowest since 2003.The holiday season was hard on retailers as Amazon (AMZN) continues to lure shoppers online and away from malls.Sears said same-store sales plunged 10.3% during the fourth quarter and sees a Q4 net loss of $635 million-$535 million vs. a year-ago loss of $580 million on revenue of $6.1 billion.Last week, Macy's (M) Chief Executive Terry Lundgren said he was open to selling Macy's as a ""proactive measure"" to prevent any shake-up on the board, according to a report from the New York Post.Macy's stock, up initially Friday, reversed to end down 1.2%.

66,SWK,"Sears Holdings (SHLD) agreed Thursday to sell its Craftsman tool brand to Stanley Black & Decker (SWK) for about $900 million, and the retail giant also announced plans to shutter 150 unprofitable Sears and Kmart stores in a bid to streamline the chain.With Sears's department-store business continuing to bleed cash, Chief Executive Edward Lampert has turned to selling and spinning off assets to keep the company operating. The hedge fund manager, who's also the retailer's chairman and largest investor, agreed earlier this week to lend the company $500 million and said last month that affiliates of his firm would offer it a $200 million line of credit.Sears also has been reviewing its DieHard batteries and Kenmore appliance brand for potential sales.""Looking ahead, we will continue to take actions to adjust our capital structure, meet our financial obligations and manage our business to better position Sears Holdings to create long-term value,"" Lampert said in Thursday's statement.Investors cheered the Craftsman sale, sending Sears up as much as 8% before settling back for a 3.7% gain. The stock had slumped 55% last year as the company continued to post losses. Shares of New Britain, Conn.-based Stanley advanced 1.9% in recent action.The Craftsman sale marks Lampert's third move in the last two weeks to prop up the beleaguered retailer with fresh sources of funding. Under terms of the deal, Stanley will pay $525 million at closing and $250 million after three years, the companies said in a statement Thursday. The buyer also will make annual payments on new Craftsman sales for 15 years.Craftsman has been part of Sears since 1927, when the retailer acquired the brand for $500. The tools debuted in the iconic Sears catalog two years later. By the 1940s, the brand benefited from a surge in power-tool sales.Craftsman was eventually offered through other retailers, including Costco Wholesale (COST) and Ace Hardware, but Sears's decline has taken a toll on the brand. Only about 10% of Craftsman-branded products are currently sold outside of Sears, and the agreement allows Stanley to increase Craftsman sales in these untapped channels.Sears will continue to carry Craftsman products at its stores. The license will be royalty-free for 15 years, and then generate 3% afterward.""To accommodate the future growth of Craftsman, we intend to expand our manufacturing footprint in the U.S.,"" Stanley CEO James M. Loree said in the statement. ""This will add jobs in the U.S., where we have increased our manufacturing head count by 40% in the past three years.""The pledge to support U.S. manufacturing comes at a time when President-elect Donald Trump has criticized companies for shifting jobs overseas. Ford Motor (F) canceled a $1.6 billion Mexican expansion earlier this week, saying it would add positions in Michigan instead.The Craftsman deal comes about three months after Stanley agreed to buy Newell Brands (NWL) tools business for $1.95 billion.For Sears, the sale is the latest in a long string of moves designed to generate cash for the ailing retail business. The Hoffman Estates, Ill.-based company raised $2.5 billion in 2015 by forming a real estate investment trust that bought more than 250 of its properties.More property sales may be coming. This week's $500 million loan was secured by the company's real estate operations in anticipation that a future sale of some properties could help pay back the debt.It's also been closing poor-performing locations, an effort it continued with Thursday's announcement. The company said it will shut 109 Kmart and 41 Sears stores, and it reiterated its intention to squeeze more money out of its real estate.Lampert also previously spun off the Sears Hometown & Outlet business and Lands' End clothing line.Still, challenges remain. The company needs to raise a total of roughly $1.5 billion to make it through 2017 comfortably, Christina Boni, an analyst at Moody's Investors Service, has estimated.

67,SWK,"JCPenney (JCP) said that same-store sales fell 0.8% in November and December, making it the latest department store giant to put up uninspiring holiday results as malls become increasingly barren and Amazon.com (AMZN)-led e-commerce thrives.Macy's (M) and Kohl's (KSS) late Wednesday cut profit forecasts due to tepid holiday sales, with both saying November-December comps slid 2.1%. Macy's also said it planned to slash 10,000 jobs as it closes 68 stores as part of a plan to shut 100 locations over time. The forecasts also came after Macy's in November expressed optimism about the holiday quarter.Meanwhile, Sears (SHLD) said this week that it would sell Craftsman to Stanley Black & Decker (SWK) and close 150 Kmart and Sears locations.JCPenney fell 3.7% to 7.57 in the stock market today after tumbling 7.2% on Thursday.The retailer said the first three weeks of November were ""challenging,"" but that comps from the Thanksgiving week through the end of December were positive. Sluggish sales in women's apparel continued to weigh on the chain's results, JCPenney said.The picture was a brighter for appliances, jewelry, outerwear, boots, toys and Sephora beauty products. JCPenney's e-commerce division saw ""double-digit growth,"" the company said, and it held to its EBITDA goal of $1 billion for fiscal 2016.""As we prepare for a new fiscal year, our turnaround in profitability remains on track, and I am pleased that we expect to deliver our fourth consecutive quarter of positive operating profit,"" CEO Marvin Ellison said in a statement.IBD'S TAKE: As traditional and specialty retailers struggle amid the galactic expansion of Amazon, off-price retailers have done better. Burlington Stores, formerly known as Burlington Coat Factory, was among the few growth stories in retail. As retailers reel, Adobe (ADBE) this week reported that online holiday sales rose 11% to a record $91.7 billion. Meanwhile, the December jobs report showed that nonstore retailers reported a 5.5% employment gain over the past 12 months. While neither report named Amazon, other surveys suggested that it was grabbing a huge share of overall e-commerce sales.Amazon rose 2%, continuing to advance after clearing its 50-day moving average earlier in the week.Macy's dipped 0.1% Friday after crashing nearly 14% Thursday.

70,SWK,"Stanley Black & Decker (SWK) agreed to buy Newell Brands (NWL) tools business for $1.95 billion in cash to expand in industrial cutting equipment.The sale includes the Irwin, Lenox and Hilmor brands, Newell said in a prepared statement Wednesday. The consumer-products company, which also owns Elmer's glue, Mr. Coffee brewers and Graco baby strollers, will use the proceeds to pay down debt, it said. Stanley Black & Decker said in its own statement that the deal will add 15 cents a share to earnings in the first year after closing.The acquisition will help broaden the reach of Stanley Black & Decker's global tools and storage business, the New Britain, Conn.-based company said. For Newell, the sale is part of an effort to slim down after its blockbuster  merger with Jarden Corp. in April. That deal created a company with $16 billion in sales and pushed Newell into new categories such as sports and outdoor products.The acquisition will lead to annual cost savings of about $80 million to $90 million after three years, Stanley Black & Decker said. The deal should close in the first half of 2017, it said.IBD'S TAKE: Stanley Black & Decker is ranked third in IBD's ""Building-Hand Tools Group."" Trouble is, that sector ranks 174th out 197 groups IBD follows. The best of the lot right now is Toro Co.

Newell shares tacked on another 2.2% by Wednesday's close, on top of the 14% climb it has seen for the year. Stanley Black & Decker, up 10% for the year, moved up 2.9% by the close Wednesday.Newell said this month that it will streamline its portfolio, turning 32 business units into 16 operating divisions. The company said at the time that it would divest about 10% of its products, including most of its tools division.The process to sell the other brands is underway and Newell hopes to wrap it up in the first half of next year, the company said Wednesday. Those assets include the Voelkl and K2 winter sports brands, the heaters, humidifiers and fans business and the Rubbermaid consumer storage operations, Newell said.Chief Executive Mike Polk said when the Jarden merger was announced that he was aiming to squeeze $500 million in costs out of the business within four years. The company also is moving its headquarters from Atlanta to Hoboken, N.J. Jarden had been assembled by Martin E. Franklin, who used acquisitions to build the company's vast array of brands.

74,SWK,"Jan Matzeliger was lucky to have any shoes at all when he was growing up in South America. His mother was a slave in 19th century Dutch Guiana (now Suriname). She died when he was three, and an aunt raised him.The government of Holland had brought 300,000 slaves from Africa to build dikes along the coast to create plantations. Most of the workers went barefoot; some were given wooden shoes.Fortunately, Jan's mother could afford leather shoes; she had married a Dutchman, one of 21,000 from the homeland who were working in the colony. He supervised factories and often brought his son to work.Jan was apprenticed to a machinist at 10, became a master at 19 and came to America to seek his fortune in 1873.Four years later, he was working at one of the shoe factories in Lynn, Mass., where over half the nation's footwear was produced.""Shoe manufacturing was done by machine except for lasting, which was sewing the upper part to the sole, a highly skilled process that allowed the lasters to keep their wages high,"" Edward O'Donnell, author of the Great Courses' audiovisual program ""The Gilded Age and Progressive Era,"" told IBD. ""A laster could finish 50 pairs in a 10-hour day, and all efforts to automate this had failed. Through careful observation of what they did and many experiments, Matzeliger built a machine that could turn out 700 a day, revolutionizing manufacturing and making shoes affordable for everyone.""On To AmericaMatzeliger (1852-89) was born in Paramaribo, Dutch Guiana's capital, which looked like a town in Holland, with brick houses and red tile roofs.Dutch steamships arrived loaded with products from New England and left with coffee, sugar and spices. Everyone stopped working at midday for a few hours because of the tropical sun.Jan could cut and shape any tool or product from metal on a lathe by the time he became certified as a master. His father expected him to open his own local shop.But Jan was more ambitious, aiming for a fortune abroad. He spent the next two years as a merchant seaman, making repairs as his vessels sailed to Asia and back.Stopping in Philadelphia in 1873, he saw a bustling industrial city with a lot of machine shops and decided to stay.His English was poor, and he didn't understand why doors were slammed in his face when he applied for jobs. Fortunately, members of one of the 25 local black churches befriended him.Philadelphia had the largest black population of any city in the North because Quakers had invited escaped slaves to settle there after they reached nearby Wilmington, Del., the last stop on the Underground Railroad before the end of the Civil War in 1865.Matzeliger helped his transition by learning English in night classes. During the day, he worked at menial jobs — then found traction.His break came when he passed by a cobbler who was using a McKay stitching machine to sew together the seams of a sole.Matzeliger told him about his background and was hired to sew for the next two years.The owner recommended that to learn about other machines that the big factories used, he needed to go to Lynn, near Boston.Matzeliger arrived in early 1877.He improved his English, but the town full of European immigrants saw him as a threat to their jobs and shunned him. He visited many of the 170 footwear makers, only to be turned away.""After days of walking the streets, Jan came to the Harney Brothers factory,"" wrote Barbara Mitchell in ""Shoes for Everyone."" Harney needed people experienced in sewing on the McKay machine and gave him a try. ""The stitches were straight and even. The sole was perfectly sewn. It took most new workers weeks of training before they could turn out a piece of work like this."" Amazed, Harney hired him.Matzeliger spent everything he had on room, food, books about mechanical science and tools to draw equipment that might solve all kinds of problems. He convinced Harney to appoint him as millwright, which let him roam the factory doing repairs on the spot.""The last and hardest part (of making shoes) still had to be done by hand,"" CityofLynn.net noted. ""Skilled shoemakers would shape the leather upper part over a foot-shaped wooden mold called a last and sew it into the sole.""On BlackHistoryNow.com is a description of how the hand lasters leveraged their position: They ""held enormous power over the entire process and therefore over the industry, their co-workers and prices for finished shoes. Organized as a union, the Company of Shoemakers, they staged work stoppages to demonstrate their control and enforce high wages. ... They were convinced that no machine could duplicate their skill, and the industry (which had already spent large sums attempting to solve this problem) agreed.""Matzeliger carefully noted every movement that the lasters made in the process so he could build a machine that would imitate what they did. He moved to a poorer section of town to pay less rent and work in secret. He spent every penny to construct a lasting machine made of pieces of other machines, cigar boxes, wire and nails.By the fall of 1880, he had his first prototype, but he realized that he needed a forge and lathe to construct one of all metal. He moved to the Beal Bros. factory, where the owners provided him the equipment and let him work in secret for a small stake in the outcome.Finally, in 1882, he had his metal prototype ready. As word got around, he had offers for the rights as high as $1,500 (equal to $36,000 now). He turned down everyone, but he knew that to get a patent (something no black man could have even filed 18 years earlier), he needed a sturdier machine. He sought investors. Lynn businessmen C.H. Delnow and M.S. Nichols agreed, with Matzeliger retaining one-third ownership in the new Union Lasting Machine Co.After constructing his third prototype of the mechanical laster, Matzeliger sent the 15-page application to the U.S. Patent Office. Officials had seen other proposals like it over the years, so they sent an investigator to Lynn. The result, in March 1883, was his first of six patents as he perfected the machine.To do the manufacturing, Matzeliger and his two partners brought in two leaders in the machine industry, George Brown and Sidney Winslow, to form Consolidated Lasting Machine to make the laster, based on Union's patents.All-OutA team of 250 worked day and night at their plant in Beverly, Mass., near Lynn, to fill orders from around the world.Matzeliger became wealthy, but he died at age 37 of tuberculosis.In 1899, several shoemaking firms merged with Consolidated to form a New Jersey company: United Shoe Machine. By 1910, it had 80% of the shoe machinery market in America and assets of $40 million (worth $1 billion now).In 1968, it changed its name to USM; eight years later, it merged to form Emhart. In 1989, in order to resist a $2 billion takeover attempt, Emhart merged with what is now Stanley Black & Decker (SWK).In 1987, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People financed a statue of Matzeliger at the base of a bridge in Lynn named after him. Four years later, the U.S. Postal Service honored him with a stamp.BlackHistoryNow.com noted: His invention led to ""a 50% reduction in the price of shoes, a doubling of wages for the shoe factory workers and improved working conditions."" And Matzeliger ""also left a legacy of successfully meeting an 'impossible' challenge ... and creating a global industry.""

75,SWK,"When people mention the building sector, many folks think of homebuilders. Sometimes, though, such associations can be misleading. It's not enough to ask which of the 33 sectors are doing well. You have to know where the strength is within the sector.That's why IBD breaks the market into 197 industry groups.Homebuilders, for example, have a Relative Strength line that has been moving sideways since August. (The RS line measures performance vs. the S&P 500. A rising line points to outperformance; a falling line to laggard action; and a sideways line to performance in line with the S&P 500.)Meanwhile, the building sector has been in the top five among 33 sectors in that same period.So where is the real strength?Nine industry groups make up the building sector. Only three show rising RS lines over the past few months. Hand tools' RS line is at a 52-week high. Within the group, the top three stocks are Toro (TTC), Snap-on (SNA) and Stanley Black & Decker (SWK).Of those three, Toro has delivered the best earnings growth in the most recently reported quarter. Earnings jumped 121% on a 16% increase in revenue.Toro's Boss unit boosted results — it wrapped up the acquisition of Boss, a designer and maker of snowplows and salt and sand spreaders, in November 2014.The stock is in the 5% buy zone above a 74.22 buy point. Wood products' RS line is just off a recent high. The industry group has four stocks, and only two posted earnings gains in the past two quarters.Universal Forest Products (UFPI) grew earnings 19% and 31% in Q2 and Q3, respectively. Revenue rose 8% and 7% in the same quarters.The stock, though, fell 8% Dec. 8 on DA Davidson's downgrade from neutral to underperform. Universal is thinly traded, with a daily average volume of $12 million.April initial public offering Enviva Partners (EVA) posted a profit of 4 cents a share in Q2 vs. a loss of 8 cents a share in the year-earlier quarter. In Q3, earnings rose 108% to 27 cents a share. Revenue jumped 60% and 53% in the same quarters.Enviva is a master limited partnership involving wood pellets, which customers use to replace coal in power generation. The manufactured homes and RV group has enjoyed a rising RS line, though the line recently faded.The group has six stocks, but only one has delivered double-digit earnings growth in two or more consecutive quarters.Patrick Industries (PATK) grew EPS at least 27% in each of the past six quarters. Sales growth varied from 14% to 31% in the same six quarters.The stock has two drawbacks: A late October breakout failed, eventually driving the stock under its 50-day line and testing the 200-day line. Also, the stock is thinly traded, with a daily average dollar volume of about $5 million.

94,SWK,"Stanley Black & Decker (SWK) topped Wall Street's expectations for the second quarter as strong organic growth in equipment sales evened out the strong dollar's negative impact.The New Britain, Conn.-based company reported net income of $227.2 million or $1.49 a share. Excluding certain one-time items, the company earned $1.54, up 7.7% from a year earlier. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters forecast $1.43 a share.However, revenue fell 0.7% to $2.87 billion, still beating estimates of $2.82 billion.Net sales for Q2 were $2.9 billion, roughly flat year over year, as a 7% gain in volume and a 1% gain in price were offset by an 8% currency drag. Cost-cutting and a recovering U.S. housing market has helped Stanley Black & Decker's results. Its tools and storage unit sales rose 3.8% to $1.84 billion, helped by strength in the North America market.The company boosted its full-year EPS outlook to the range of $5.70 to $5.90, up from $5.65 to $5.85.By early afternoon, trading, shares had fallen 1.2% to 106.78 in the stock market today but are up about 11% so far this year, trading near all-time highs.

96,SWK,"While the Trump trade war has created plenty of fear in financial markets — the Dow Jones fell for an eighth straight session Thursday — companies haven't had much to say about what it means for them. That's likely to change during second-quarter earnings calls starting early in July. The news is likely to be negative.""With the trade war expanding in scope and geography, while moving from rhetoric to action, we expect companies to update and increase the potential negative impacts from tariffs during upcoming second-quarter earnings calls,"" CFRA Research analyst Elizabeth Vermillion wrote in a Thursday note.She cited Dow Jones industrial average component Caterpillar (CAT), Deere (DE), Fastenal (FAST) and Stanley Black & Decker (SWK) as among the companies that likely face a negative Trump trade war impact but have yet to disclose it. Investors, however, may already be pricing in at least some impact of the Trump trade war. On Thursday, shares of Caterpillar slipped 2.2%, falling for a seventh straight session. Meanwhile, Deere lost 1.4%, Fastenal 3.3% and Stanley 2.1%.During first-quarter earnings season, President Donald Trump's tariffs on steel and aluminum had yet to apply to Canada, Mexico and the European Union. Trump lifted exemptions from the 25% steel and 10% aluminum tariffs effective June 1. Further, potential tariffs aimed at Chinese high-tech imports were still in the process of being detailed. Now 25% tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese high-tech imports have a July 6 due date, and Beijing has made clear it plans to match them, dollar for dollar, with tariffs on U.S. goods. On Friday, European Union retaliatory tariffs kick in.German industrial giant Daimler (DDAIF) warned late Wednesday that Chinese tariffs on its U.S.-built Mercedes-Benz SUVs would hit earnings. Daimler's U.S. shares fell 4.5% Thursday to their lowest since December 2016.While it's possible that the Trump trade war vs. China may be over before it really begins, uncertainty over Trump's sanctions reprieve for Chinese communications equipment firm ZTE may stall negotiations until after the July 6 date for tariffs to begin.Even the tariffs on Chinese imports may have a direct negative impact on U.S. corporate earnings. An analysis by the Peterson Institute for International Economics found that the bulk of those tariffs would apply to goods produced in China by multinationals based in the U.S. and countries other than China.Meanwhile, steel and aluminum prices have been on the rise. Labor Department data show that prices for steel mill products rose 4.3% in May, on top of a 3.2% April increase, even before Trump ended most exemptions. Aluminum prices rose 5% last month, following April's 1.8% rise.""While we see increased risks heading into the second-quarter earnings period, we continue to believe that fundamentals (for industrial machinery producers and distributors) are solid,"" Vermillion wrote.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:Don't Panic: Here's Why Trump's China Trade War Won't HappenIBD Stock Of The Day: Hot Tech Makes Bullish Move Toward Buy Point, Defying Sell-OffThe Big Picture: 30 Reasons Why Nasdaq Keeps Flogging The Dow Jones Industrial AverageStock Market Today: Track Market Trends And The Best Stocks To Watch

120,SWK,"Industrial tool maker Stanley Black & Decker, Inc. (SWK  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 24, before the market opens.Over the last four quarters, the company reported better-than-expected results on all occasions, pulling off an average positive earnings surprise of 5.38%. Notably, in the last quarter, the company’s earnings of $1.29 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8.40%.

Price and EPS Surprise  Stanley Black & Decker, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.

Moreover, its positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum. What is Driving the Better-than-Expected Earnings?We believe that Stanley Black & Decker is poised to benefit from constant innovation of new products and development of existing ones within the Industrial, Security and Tools & Storage segments in the quarter. Improved demand for products like FLEXVOLT might be advantageous for the Tools & Storage segment. Also, the company’s restructuring activities in the past few months, including acquisitions of Newell Brands and Craftsman tool brand, and disposal of a majority portion of its Mechanical Security businesses, might positively influence the quarter’s results.In addition, we believe that operating conditions in the industry have been favorable for toll makers like Stanley Black & Decker in the quarter. Industrial production – a measure of the level of output of manufacturing, mining and utilities sectors in a country – grew at an annual rate of 4.7% in the second quarter, driven by impressive growth in mining and utilities. New orders for U.S.-manufactured machinery increased 4.6% in the first five months of 2017. Also, the government’s policies encouraging better trade relations, increase in infrastructural investments, job creation and high consumer-end demand will support growth of machinery companies.On a separate note, we believe that the company’s shareholder-friendly policies will work in its favor in the quarters ahead. Recently, it declared a 5 cents increase in its quarterly dividend rate, which now stands at 63 cents per share.     However, Stanley Black & Decker’s exposure to headwinds including uncertain global economic conditions, unfavorable foreign currency movements, commodity inflation, industry rivalry and high debt levels remain major causes of concern.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other companies in the machinery industry you may want to consider, as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter, according to our model.Dover Corporation (DOV  -  Free Report), with an Earnings ESP of +4.00% and a Zacks Rank #2.

121,SWK,"We have issued an updated research report on Stanley Black & Decker, Inc. (SWK  -  Free Report) on Jun 26. The company’s earnings are projected to grow 10.23% in the next three to five years.This industrial tool maker currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Its market capitalization is approximately $20.8 billion.Let’s delve deeper and discuss the company’s potential growth drivers and probable headwinds.Factors Favoring Stanley Black & DeckerNear- and Long-Term Projections: Stanley Black & Decker pulled off better-than-expected results in the last four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 2.92%. Also, the company currently has Earnings ESP of +0.29% for 2018 and +1.01% for 2019. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Its earnings estimates of $8.42 for 2018 and $9.43 for 2019 represent year-over-year growth of 13% and 12%, respectively.For 2018, Stanley Black & Decker anticipates gaining from rising exposure in emerging markets, efforts to innovate products and growing popularity of brands like Craftsman, Lenox, Irwin and DeWalt FlexVolt. Also, benefits from acquired assets, favorable pricing, cost-saving actions and productivity-enhancement initiatives will be a boon for the bottom line. Adjusted earnings in the year are predicted to be $8.30-$8.50 per share, above $7.45 recorded in 2017. Organic sales growth is predicted to be roughly 5%.By 2022, Stanley Black & Decker aims at generating revenues of approximately $22 billion while revenue rise is predicted at 10-12% (CAGR), including organic sales growth of 4-6% and acquisition revenues of roughly $6-$8 million. Earnings per share are forecasted to grow 10-12% or roughly 6-8%, excluding buyouts. Healthy segmental performance is being anticipated, with Industrial revenues of $5-$6 billion, Tools & Storage revenues of $12-$14 billion and Security revenues of $3-$4 billion.Solidifying Portfolio Through Acquisitions: Over time, acquired assets have played an important role in expanding Stanley Black & Decker’s business. For instance, Newell Tools has been strengthening the company’s tools business since it the acquisition in March 2017. Prime brands added via this buyout were Irwin and Lenox. Also, Craftsman acquisition (completed in March 2017) has fortified the company’s existing global tools and storage brands. Availability of Craftsman products at Lowe’s retail stores will be a boon. Moreover, Nelson Fastener Systems — acquired in April 2018 — has been boosting growth opportunities for the Engineered Fastening business.Shareholder-Friendly Policy: Rewarding shareholders handsomely through dividend payments and share buybacks have always remained Stanley Black & Decker’s priority. In the long run, the company wishes to follow its 50/50 capital allocation strategy for acquisitions and rewarding shareholders. Dividend payout is predicted to be 30-35% in the years ahead.Factors Working Against Stanley Black & DeckerWeakness in Industrial Segment, Poor Share Price Performance: Performance of the Industrial segment was weak in first-quarter 2018. It recorded flat organic sales result in the reported quarter versus 2% growth registered in the fourth quarter of 2017. For 2018, headwinds related to lesser oil and gas projects, and the automotive system rollovers are predicted to be primarily responsible for a low-single-digit decline in organic sales of the Industrial segment. Also, the segment’s margin is estimated to decline year over year in the year.Stanley Black & Decker’ shares plunged 6.5% post the release of first-quarter of 2018 results on April 20, while declined roughly 10.5% in the past three months. The three-month fall is worse than 7.2% decline recorded by the industry it belongs to.Adversaries Arising From Rising Costs: Stanley Black & Decker is dealing with adverse impacts of rising cost of sales. Notably, the company’s cost of sales in the last five years (2013-2017) grew at 2.7% (CAGR). Notably, in first-quarter 2018, cost of sales increased 14.5% year over year. Gross margin in the quarter slipped 120 basis points year over year as commodity inflation of $50 million negated positive impacts of volume growth and improved productivity. We believe that unwarranted rise in costs and expenses will prove detrimental to the company’s margins and profitability.For 2018, the company anticipates commodity inflation in steel, base metals, batteries and others — including resin, components, fuel and packaging — to be approximately $180 million, higher than $150 million predicted earlier. Also, tariff imposition on imports of steel and aluminum is predicted to have an adverse impact of less than $3 million, annually. These two aspects are predicted to lower earnings by 15 cents per share in 2018.Other Headwinds: Stanley Black & Decker serves customers in various end markets, which are highly susceptible to global economic conditions. Especially, lower level of industrial activities and difficult housing market conditions in the countries, where the company operates, will adversely impact its sales, earnings and cash flow. Also, business expansion in foreign nations has exposed the company to risks, emanating from adverse movements in foreign currencies and geopolitical issues.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the Zacks Industrial Products sector are Twin Disc, Incorporated (TWIN  -  Free Report), Actuant Corporation (ATU  -  Free Report) and Graco Inc. (GGG  -  Free Report). While both Twin Disc and Actuant sport Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Graco carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.In the last 60 days, earnings estimates for each of these stocks improved for the current year. Also, average positive earnings surprise for last four quarters has been 250.43% for Twin Disc and 12.81% for Graco while Actuant recorded positive surprise of 8.33% in the last quarter.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

Also, the bottom line increased 6.9% from the year-ago quarter's tally of $1.30 on the back of healthy segmental results and synergistic gains. These positives offset the adverse impacts of commodity inflation.Segmental Performance Drives RevenuesIn the quarter, Stanley Black & Decker's net sales were $3,209.3 million, up 12.4% from the year-ago quarter. The improvement was primarily driven by 4% volume gains, 4% positive-currency impact and 6% gain from acquired assets, partially offset by 2% adverse impact from divested assets (Mechanical Security business in February 2017).Also, the top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.1 billion by 3.5%.Stanley Black & Decker reports revenues under three market segments. A brief discussion of the quarterly results is provided below:Tools & Storage's revenues totaled $2,215.8 million, representing 69% of net revenues in the quarter.

Favorable currency impact of 5%, price gain of 1% and acquisition gains of 3% were partially offset by 5% negative impact of divestitures and 2% from lower volumes.Margin Profile Weak on Higher Costs and ExpensesStanley Black & Decker's cost of sales in the first quarter increased 14.5% year over year to $2,041.9 million. It was 63.6% of the quarter's net sales versus 62.4% in the year-ago quarter.

Also, the buyout of Nelson Fastener Systems' industrial business (completed on April 2) will strengthen the company’s Engineered Fastening business.The company reaffirmed adjusted earnings guidance for the year of $8.30-$8.50 per share, reflecting year-over-year growth of 11-14%. Organic sales growth will be roughly 5%.Commodity inflation of $180 million is predicted to lower earnings by 15 cents. This forecast includes adverse impacts of the imposition of import tariffs on steel and aluminum. Earlier, the company predicted commodity cost inflation of $150 million.

124,SWK,"Q1 earnings season has thus far had a pronounced calming effect on market volatility this week; after more than a month of wild turbulence based on a host of external issues, impressive growth and positive surprises for companies so far reported have brought a welcome tepidness to daily trading. Even when markets are down like they were Thursday, there were no three- or four-digit spikes to strike fear into the hearts of investors.This quarterly good news continues into Friday’s pre-market, with beleaguered industrial major General Electric (GE  -  Free Report) posting a positive surprise on both top and bottom lines. Earnings of 16 cents per share outpaced the 11 cents expected, whereas quarterly sales of $28.7 billion surpassed the $27.9 billion in the Zacks consensus.CEO John Flannery had already described 2018 as a “reset year,” following a long duration of losses and underperforming segments under past leadership. Many analysts still expect GE to take some sort of different form in terms of business holdings down the road, but for now the market is pleased with the Q1 beat.

127,SWK,"The January-March quarter of 2018 was eventful for U.S. equity investors. Positive reactions followed the Trump government’s announcement of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed last December. Soon after that, fears of inflation and imposition of import tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminum stalled the positive momentum. Then, the recent joint attack by the United States, Britain and France on Syria rocked the world, leaving many pondering over its possible after effects.Notwithstanding these issues, equity investors must closely follow the financial releases for the first quarter of 2018. Though results of some banking stocks failed to impress the market, we believe that important releases, slated for this week and the next, will be a major determinant of the movements in the U.S. equity market.Per our in-house classifications, the U.S. equity universe is grouped into 16 sectors. The projections, as published in the Earnings Trends report on Apr 18, calls for 17.8% year-over-year growth in earnings of the S&P 500 companies in the first quarter. Collectively, revenues of these companies are predicted to rise 7.6% and margins to grow 1%.As of Apr 18, roughly 10.4% of the S&P 500 companies have reported their results. The performance so far is impressive, with year-over-year earnings growth of 27.9% and revenue growth of 10.7%. Beat was measured at 84.6% for earnings and 78.8% for revenues.We believe that it will be interesting to watch how the earnings season unfolds for the Industrial Products sector. It currently occupies the first position in the Zacks sectors list. Performance So Far & Projections for Industrial ProductsTill Apr 18, 4.2% of the Industrial Products companies reported results for this season. With a beat of 100%, earnings increased 26.2% while revenues grew 24% compared with the year-ago tally.With bulk earnings yet to come, Industrial Products’ earnings are predicted to grow 24.4% year over year in the first quarter. Revenues are anticipated to increase 12.5% and margins are projected to expand 0.9%.Despite the turbulence in the market, we believe that many positive factors during the quarter must have supported growth for the industrial companies. Of many, trends indicating an expanding manufacturing sector, rising new orders for U.S.-made machinery, strengthening job market as evident from a 17-year low unemployment rate of 4.1% in March and 4.5% growth in industrial products in the first quarter are worth mentioning. What’s in Store for 2 Industrial Stocks: SWK & ROP?Below, we discuss briefly the expectations from the two industrial stocks slated to report their numbers for the first quarter tomorrow, before the market opens. Stanley Black & Decker, Inc. (SWK  -  Free Report): This industrial tool maker delivered better-than-expected results in the last four quarters, pulling off an average positive earnings surprise of 4.28%.Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.

Despite growing recognition for products like Craftsman, Lenox, Irwin and DeWalt FlexVolt; growth opportunities in emerging markets and zeal for product innovation, the company faces hurdles that can jeopardize its results for the first quarter. These roadblocks include weakness in onshore activity in the pipeline market, soft security business in France, poor sales of automotive system and commodity price inflation, among others.For the first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s Tools & Storage, Industrial and Security segments are at $2,126 million, $462 million and $479 million, respectively. These segmental projections are below the respective sales of $2,430 million, $474 million and $510 million, generated in the prior quarter.Over the last 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter decreased 2.2% to $1.35.

128,SWK,"Stanley Black & Decker, Inc. (SWK  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 20, before market opens.The company pulled off an average positive earnings surprise of 4.28% over the last four quarters. Notably, in the last reported quarter, Stanley Black & Decker’s adjusted earnings of $2.18 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.14 by 1.87%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayStanley Black & Decker noted that reduced onshore project activity in the pipeline market and dismal automotive system sales will dent its first-quarter 2018 revenues. Moreover, prevalent sluggishness in the self-piercing rivet system and engineered fastening electronics sales might dampen the company’s industrial business. Also, a lackluster security business in France is predicted to hit the company’s revenues in the quarter to be reported.The Zacks Consensus Estimates for first-quarter revenues of Stanley Black & Decker’s Security, Industrial, and Tools & Storage segments are currently pegged at $479 million, $462 million and $2,126 million, respectively, lower than $510 million, $474 million and $2,430 million recorded in the prior quarter.Stanley Black & Decker has been expanding its distribution and manufacturing capacity on the back of several investments. However, these expenses are expected to drag down its margins in the near term. Profitability of the company’s Tools & Storage and Security segments were hurt in the last quarter due to these growth-oriented investments.Moreover, Stanley Black & Decker believes commodity inflation, especially in tools, will impede its profitability in the first quarter. The company expects to record net cost headwind of roughly $50 million in the first-quarter.The company expects that its earnings in 2018 will lie in the $8.30-$8.50 per share range and first-quarter earnings will be nearly 16% of the full-year performance, being roughly 130 basis points lower than the year-ago quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimates for first-quarter operating profit of Stanley Black & Decker’s Security and Tools & Storage segments are currently pegged at $47.8 million and $306 million, respectively, lower than $56 million and $392 million recorded in the previous quarter.However, sturdier sales of iconic brands like Craftsman, Lenox and Irwin, greater innovation, cost synergies secured from acquisitions, and reduced corporate-tax rate might offset adversaries, and drive Stanley Black & Decker’s first-quarter bottom-line performance.Earnings WhispersOur proven model provides some idea on the stocks that are about to release their earnings results. Per the model, a stock needs to have a combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for a likely earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.That is not the case here as we will see below.Zacks ESP: Stanley Black & Decker’s Earnings ESP is 0.00%.

129,SWK,"It has been a roller-coaster ride for the U.S. equity market since the beginning of 2018.The implementation of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December last year was wholeheartedly welcomed by the market, as evident from rallies in major domestic indexes in January. Nonetheless, this uptrend was short-lived as fears of inflation gripped the market in February, pulling down the major indexes for a while. Further, in March, President Trump announced the imposition of import tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminium.Thereafter, apprehensions about retaliatory measures coming from foreign nations, especially China, have been affecting investor sentiments. Also, weakness in the tech stocks has been a burning issue along with recent indications of a possible military attack on Syria.Corrections in connection to the prevalent uncertainties have turned year-to-date yields of the country’s prime stock indexes red. While the S&P 500 has lost nearly 1.2%, Dow Jones Industrial Average has declined 2.1% and the NYSE dipped 2.3%. However, Nasdaq has gained nearly 2.4% during the same time frame.Now we await the corporate earnings releases for the January-March quarter (or the first quarter) of 2018. The season has already begun and will be in full swing from the next week. We here focus on the top-ranked sector — Industrial Products — which is among the 16 broad Zacks sectors.The Industrial Sector’s TrendsThe sector has retained its top ranking this week and has also topped the Zacks Heat Map for the fifth consecutive week. (To learn more visit: About Zacks Sector Rank)Major propellers for the industrial companies are strengthening housing market, impressive job data and investment-friendly government policies. Also, healthy growth in industrial production and strengthening manufacturing sector, evident from the ISM’s Purchasing Managers’ index trend, are supporting the positive momentum.Despite the strong fundamentals, the Industrial sector has lost 8% year to date, wider than declines registered by the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and the NYSE. Some companies are believed to have lost ground reacting primarily to the negative sentiments prevalent in the market and some internal issues while many still represent good investment options.Per the Earnings Trends published on Apr 11, earnings for the Industrial Products companies in the S&P 500 group are predicted to increase 24.1% year over year in the quarter on revenue growth of 12.5%. Margins will likely grow 0.9%. The positive appeal gets a bit dimmed, if these projections are compared with year-over-year growth rates of 34.8% for earnings, 14.5% for revenues and 1.5% for margins recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 (September-December quarter). Also, a decelerating trend can be seen in growth rates of earnings and revenues for three-month period upto the first quarter of 2019.In-House Tools to Judge the StocksInvestment decisions, especially before earnings announcements, can be taken by using some of our in-house tools. A popular way of deciding is to opt for stocks that possess a combination of favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Earnings ESP is the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The combination of favorable ranking and positive Earnings ESP suggests that a stock has a high probability of beating estimates in the to-be reported quarter.Investor can try and optimize their portfolio returns through the above-mentioned way while can also try and minimize losses by avoiding stocks that have high probability of lagging estimates. The second can be achieved by refraining from investing in stocks that possess a combination of Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell) and a negative Earnings ESP.We have zeroed in on to three stocks that should preferably be avoided ahead of earnings. A brief discussion on these stocks is provided below:iRobot Corporation (IRBT  -  Free Report): The company is one of leading robots manufactures in the world. It currently faces risks from stiff industry rivalry and unfavorable movements in foreign currencies while a trade with China might adversely impact its labor, raw materials and other related supplies for its home robotic products.The company, with approximately $1.9 billion market capitalization, carries a Zacks Rank #4. Its Earnings ESP for the first quarter of 2018 is -17.29%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter is 53 cents.Also, the stock’s earnings estimates for 2018 have been lowered by one brokerage firm in the last 60 days.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate is $1.43 for 2018 and $1.94 for 2019, reflecting decline of 19.7% and 3% from the respective tallies 60 days ago.Year to date, NN’s stock has lost 20.1%, wider than 6.6% decline recorded by the industry it belongs to.The company is expected to release its results on May 2.Other than the above-mentioned stocks, we caution against sell-rated stocks going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum. Some of these stocks are Actuant Corporation (ATU  -  Free Report), The ExOne Company (XONE  -  Free Report), Intellicheck, Inc. (IDN  -  Free Report), Stanley Black & Decker, Inc. (SWK  -  Free Report) among others.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

130,SWK,"Accelerating growth of the global economy, from 3.2% in 2016 to 3.7% in 2017, had been a propeller for many countries, both advanced and emerging, including the United States. Over the two years (2016-2017), the country’s major stock indexes – S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq – have surged 30.8%, 41.9% and 37.9%, respectively. Its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) expanded roughly 1.5% in 2016 and 2.3% in 2017.The International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) growth projections are also encouraging. In its January 2018 report, the IMF predicted that the global output will expand 3.9% in both 2018 and 2019. The U.S. economy is projected to grow 2.7% in 2018 and 2.5% in 2019. These estimates reflect an improvement of 0.4% for 2018 and 0.6% for 2019 from its earlier growth forecasts.Our in-house projections indicate roughly 18% growth in earnings and a 5.6% increase in revenues for the S&P 500 companies in 2018. The earnings projection compares favorably with a growth rate of 9.7% recorded in 2017.We believe that advancement in the global economy and a strengthening domestic market will prove beneficial for demand of industrial machinery. Technological advancement in agriculture and mining industries will require upgraded farming and mining machineries, while growth in demand for packaged foods and beverages across nations will raise need for highly sophisticated food processing and packaging equipment. Further, the need for better infrastructure and residential and non-residential spaces will raise the demand for heavy construction machinery.Industrial production is one of the leading economic indicators for industrial machinery stocks. It measures the level of output of manufacturing, mining and utilities sectors in a country. A brief discussion on the machinery industry in different nations is given below.Industrial Machinery by NationThe United States: Many factors are currently working in favor of industrial machinery companies here. Encouraging job data, with an unemployment rate of 4.1% in February versus 4.7% in the year-ago month, infrastructural improvement plans of the government and strengthening housing markets are some tailwinds.Some other key economic indicators are pointing toward healthy operating conditions in the industry. The country’s industrial production grew 4.4% year over year in February. This marked the highest increase on a year-over-year basis since March 2011. Mining sector expanded 9.7%, utilities 10.5% and manufacturing 2.5%.Also, new orders for U.S.-manufactured machinery in January 2018 grew 11.4% year over year while the ISM Purchasing Managers’ Index or manufacturing index for February expanded 1.7 percentage points from the previous month. The improvement in the ISM Purchasing Managers’ Index suggests expanding economic activities in the manufacturing sector — the key highlights being healthier business conditions, favorable export orders and production, solid backlog and employment growth.Also, the implementation of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act in December 2017 lowered taxes for many corporations, enabling them to invest the free resources in growth projects. However, the government’s tariff imposition on import of steel and aluminum jolted the market somewhat, with fears of possible increase in competitive threats from international players, hike in production costs and retaliatory measures by affected nations.Japan: The country’s economy is still struggling with internal issues, including an aging population and a huge public debt.However, strengthening exports driven by a rise in automobile shipments, improvements in domestic demand induced by healthy growth in private investments and improving employment and wage rates will be beneficial. The country’s GDP grew 1.5% year over year in the fourth quarter of 2017 while registering a 0.5% rise over the previous quarter.According to the report from Japan’s Cabinet Office, core machinery orders (an indicator of capital spending by companies in the next six to nine months)increased 8.2% in January 2018. However, this is predicted to decline 1.5% in the first quarter of 2018 while total machinery orders are predicted to fall 6.9%.The IMF increased its growth projection for the country by 50 basis points (bps) to 1.2% for 2018 and by 10 bps to 0.9% for 2019.China: China’s GDP grew 6.8% year over year in the fourth quarter of 2017 while it expanded 6.9% in 2017, higher than the government’s target of 6.5%. Healthy export demand, flexible property market and rising manufacturing activities were the prime growth drivers.The country’s industrial production improved 7.2% year over year in both January and February 2018. Electricity, gas and water production as well as manufacturing sectors flourished while the mining recovered during the period.For 2018, the government of China anticipates economy to grow roughly 6.5%. We believe that robust investment for the development of infrastructure and transportation will boost the economy and spur demand for industrial machinery. Also, the country’s efforts to lower its debt burden will be advantageous. However, the possibilities of a trade war with the United States, triggered by its imposition of tariffs on steel and aluminium, might be a concerning factor for the both the countries’ trade relations.The IMF projects economy of China to grow 6.6% in 2018 and 6.4% in 2019, up roughly 10 bps from the respective previous estimates.India: The country’s major economic decisions — including demonetization and goods and services tax — along with other strategies to make the country a prime manufacturing hub for all nations across the world are expected to drive its economic growth. Also, favorable domestic job market, low interest rates allowing easy accessibility to cheap loans, infrastructure investments, healthy export demand and better monsoon conditions are additional factors that can make the country a favorable investment destination.The country’s industrial production grew 7.5% year over year in January 2018 versus a 7.1% gain recorded in December. Manufacturing output expanded 8.7%, electricity production jumped 7.6% while mere 0.1% growth was registered in mining.According to the IMF, the country is projected to grow 7.4% in 2018 and 7.8% in 2019.Brazil: The country is grappling with uncertainties on the political front that has over time adversely affected the country’s growth opportunities. General elections are due this October with high probability of abandoned initiatives to reform the country’s pension system becoming a major topic of discussion. Moreover, inadequate infrastructure and a still high unemployment rate of 12.6% (in three months ended February 2018) are other major hurdles.Partially negating these, growth in export demand, strengthening spending in the housing markets and rise in consumer confidence are currently strengthening hopes of a turnaround in the Brazilian economy. Also, falling inflation has prompted the country’s Central Bank to ease interest rates. Notably, the interest rate has been lowered 25 bps in March 2018, this being its 10th consecutive rate cut since 2017. The country’s GDP in 2017 grew 1% after 3.5% decline in both 2015 and 2016 and is predicted to grow 3% in 2018.In addition, the country’s industrial production has been encouraging, with year-over-year growth of 5.7% recorded for January 2018. This compares favorably with 4.5% growth in December 2017 and 4.7% in November 2017.The IMF expects the country’s output to grow 1.9% in 2018, reflecting a 40 bps increase from the previous forecast. Also, growth projections for 2019 have been increased 10 bps to 2.1%.Eurozone: The region, amidst all the political uncertainties, is showing improvements in export demand and labor markets. The region’s GDP improved 2.7% year over year in fourth-quarter 2017 while advanced 2.3% in 2017. Industrial production improved 2.7% year over year in January 2018.The unemployment rate was 8.6% in January 2018, down from 9.6% in the year-ago month but stable compared with December.The IMF raised output growth estimates by 30 bps both for 2018 and 2019 to 2.2% and 2%, respectively.Sector and Industry RankingIndustrial machinery stocks are broadly grouped under Industrial Products, one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors. It currently occupies the second position in the Zacks sectors list.Of the 265 industries comprising the Zacks sectors, those in the top half (i.e., industries with the best average Zacks Rank) have higher chances of beating the bottom half (i.e., the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank). (To learn more visit: About Zacks Industry Rank)We believe that investors keen on exposure to industrial machinery companies have reasons to rejoice. Machinery industries with their positions are as follows: electrical products is in the top 2% of the 265 industries while construction and mining equipment is in the top 6%, farm equipment in the top 36% and thermal products in the top 49%.Also, companies dealing in electronics are in the top 15%, material handling products in the top 5%, industrial tools and providing related services is in the top 29% and companies serving general industrial purposes are in the 42%. However, companies dealing in printing equipment for industrial use are in the bottom half at 95%.Performance and Earnings Trend of the SectorIn the past five years, the Industrial Products sector has yielded a solid 35.4% return.In the fourth quarter of 2017, earnings of Industrial Products grew 34.8% year over year, while revenues improved 14.5%. The earnings and sales growth was above 19.6% growth in earnings and 4.8% rise in revenues in the third quarter.Our in-house projections, published in the Earnings Trends report dated Mar 23, indicate roughly 19.6% growth in earnings and 8.2% increase in revenues of Industrial Products sector in 2018. Margins are likely to expand roughly 1%. Growth for earnings and margins is higher than 18.7% and 0.46%, respectively, recorded in 2017, while that for revenues is below 2017-figure of 12.9%.In the next three to five years, earnings of the Industrial Products sector are projected to grow 10.7%.Our TakeInternal requirements as well as export orders play a key role in determining the demand for industrial machineries in any country. We believe that efforts to improve trade relations across nations will be a boon for machinery companies. Also, increase in infrastructural investments, job creation and high consumer-end demand will help in further accelerating growth.It will be interesting to watch the activities of industrial machinery companies, with at least $20 billion market capitalization, including Caterpillar Inc. (CAT  -  Free Report), ABB Ltd. (ABB  -  Free Report), Illinois Tool Works Inc. (ITW  -  Free Report), Deere & Company (DE  -  Free Report), Parker-Hannifin Corp.

Earnings of Deere & Company are predicted to rise 5.67%. The company’s long-term growth prospects seem bright on the back of increasing population, rising living standards, investments in new products and expansion in unexplored geographies.Illinois Tool Works’ earnings are projected to grow 10.10% in the next three to five years.Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio?Earlier this year, credit bureau Equifax announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of every 3 Americans.

Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Recent EarningsStanley Black & Decker reported impressive results for the fourth quarter of 2017, with both earnings and sales beating their respective estimates.

Compared with the year-ago quarter, the top line grew 16.9%, primarily on the back of 9% volume gains, 3% positive currency impact and 9% gain from acquired assets, partially offset by 3% adverse impact from divested assets (Mechanical Security business in February 2017) and 1% from negative price impact.Stanley Black & Decker reports revenues under three market segments. A brief discussion on the quarterly results is provided below:Tools & Storage's revenues totaled $2,430.2 million, representing 71.2% of net revenues in the quarter. On a year-over-year basis, the segment's revenues grew 25.7% on the back of 12% gain from volume growth, 13% from acquired assets and 2% from currency movements.

Sales grew 4.3% year over year primarily driven 2% and 3% benefit from volume growth and favorable currency movements, respectively.

Favorable currency impact of 3%, volume gain of 2% and acquisition gains of 4% were more than offset by 13% negative impact of divestitures.For 2017, the company's revenues were approximately $12,747.2 million, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.6 billion by roughly 1.2%. Also, the top line grew 11.7% year over year.Gross Margin Slips on Higher CostsIn the quarter, Stanley Black & Decker's cost of sales increased 17.2% year over year, accounting for 63.3% of quarter’s net sales versus 63.1% in the year-ago quarter.

Also, the acquisition of Nelson Fastener Systems' industrial business will be advantageous. This buyout, anticipated to be complete in the first half of 2018, will strengthen the company's Engineered Fastening business and will be accretive to earnings per share.The company anticipates adjusted earnings per share in the year to be within the $8.30-$8.50 range. Organic sales growth will be roughly 5%, adding 50-60 cents to earnings per share.Commodity inflation of approximately $150 million will be partially offset by favorable pricing. The net impact of these will reduce earnings by 25-30 cents. Also, acquired assets, benefits from cost-savings actions and productivity enhancements, net of adverse impact of rise in share count, will add 45-50 cents to earnings. Tax rate of 18% will benefit earnings by 20 cents.On a segmental basis, organic revenues are projected to increase in the mid-single digit range for Tools & Storage segment and in low-single digits for Security segment. For Industrial segment, organic revenues are predicted to decline in low-single digit.Free cash flow conversion is predicted to be roughly 100%.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates.

134,SWK,"Industrial tool maker, Stanley Black & Decker, Inc. (SWK  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 24, before the market opens.In the past four quarters, the company delivered better-than-expected results, with an average positive earnings surprise of 4.27%. In the last quarter, the company’s earnings of $2.01 per share exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.55%.Since the second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 24, the company’s shares have yielded 9.4% return, outperforming 8.1% gain of the industry it belongs to. Also, during the same time period, the company outperformed the S&P 500’s gain of 2.4%.Let us see whether Stanley Black & Decker will be able to maintain its earnings streak this quarter. Factors Likely to Drive Q3 ResultsGrowth prospects seem impressive for Stanley Black & Decker’s Tools & Storage segment, as evident from mid-single digit organic revenue growth expected in the year. The segmental results will get a boost from wide acceptance of DeWalt FlexVolt product and synergistic benefits from Newell Tools and Craftsman buyouts.In the first two quarters of 2017, the surprise history of Tools & Storage segment has been impressive, with an average positive sales surprise of 1.64%. Third-quarter sales estimates are $2,228 million, an improvement over average sales of $2,057.5 million generated in the first half of the year.Stanley Black & Decker anticipates earnings in the third quarter to be roughly 25% to 26% (average is 25.5%) of 2017 earnings expected range. Considering the projected adjusted earnings per share range of $7.18-$7.38, we believe that earnings in the third quarter will likely be within $1.80-$1.92 per share (mid-point is $1.86), way above $1.68 recorded in the year-ago quarter. On a separate note, we believe that the company’s shareholder-friendly policies will work in its favor in the quarters ahead.Also, we believe that industrial machinery is among the many industries that have rallied on the back of the Trump government’s proposed infrastructure investment of $1 trillion. If implemented, the promised plan will boost the need for industrial products and hence benefit companies like Stanley Black & Decker. Other tailwinds are the strengthening housing and commercial construction markets. Also, rise of 2 percentage points in Purchasing Managers’ Index or manufacturing index in September is a positive indicator for the industry. Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Stanley Black & Decker is likely to pull off a surprise this quarter. That is because the stock has the combination of two key ingredients for a possible earnings beat — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold).You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.

135,SWK,"On Jan 2, iRobot Corporation (IRBT  -  Free Report) was upgraded to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) from a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Going by the Zacks model, companies carrying a Zacks Rank #2 have chances of performing better than the broader market over the next two to three months.Why the Upgrade?Over the last month, iRobot’s shares yielded a return of 24%, outperforming 3.4% growth recorded by the industry.Notably, the stock currently carries an attractive VGM Score of B.In October 2017, iRobot raised its revenue guidance for full-year 2017 (results not yet released) from the $815-$825 million range to $870-$880 million (estimating a year-over-year increment of 33-34%). The company expects that robust sales of popular home robotic products (Roomba 800) and the ongoing marketing programs will bolster its revenues in all end markets across the United States, and the Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region.The company also intends to reinforce its business on the back of strategic inorganic growth programs. In October 2017, it successfully acquired its largest European distributor — Robopolis. The deal is sync with iRobot’s strategy to gain greater direct control over go-to-market execution in the overseas end markets. Notably, the company believes that it would be able to serve the demands of the European end users more efficiently on the back of the Robopolis buyout.We also notice that iRobot constantly tries to enhance its product portfolio and boost aggregate sales on the back of innovation investments. For instance, the wi-fi enabled Roomba 890 and 690 robots (launched in May 2017) are expected to secure sturdy market response in all markets across the United States, Europe, China and the EMEA region. In addition, the company intends to equip consumers with more state-of-the-art home robotic products.The company also believes its commercial success is largely dependent on the hold of its proprietary technology as well as capability of employees to continue with further innovation. In sync with this, iRobots has entered into agreements with Stanley Black & Decker, Inc. (SWK  -  Free Report) (in December 2017) and Micro-Star International Co., Ltd. (in September 2017) to manage matters related to patent dispute.

136,SWK,"We have issued an updated research report on industrial tool maker Stanley Black & Decker, Inc. (SWK  -  Free Report) on Dec 20. Strengthening tools business as well as expanding product portfolio through meaningful acquisitions will prove beneficial. However, the growth momentum might get restricted by headwinds stemming from rising cost and huge debts, international exposure, industry competition plus global uncertainties.Stanley Black & Decker carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Below we briefly discuss the company’s potential growth drivers and possible challenges.Factors Favoring Stanley Black & DeckerStrengthening Tools Businesses: We believe Stanley Black & Decker is poised to benefit from its strengthening end markets and growing brand recognition. For Tools & Storage segment, the company anticipates organic revenues to increase in the high-single digit range compared mid-single numbers, expected earlier.Results will be primarily driven by fortifying construction market in the United States and relatively stable operating conditions in Europe and the emerging markets. Net revenues from DeWalt FlexVolt are anticipated to be approximately $200 million. Also, in the quarters ahead, benefits from Newell Tools and Craftsman acquisitions will boost the segment’s result. By the second half of 2018, the Craftsman products will be available in Lowe’s retail stores.Inorganic Initiatives Drive Growth Opportunities: Acquired assets have over time contributed to Stanley Black & Decker’s expansion. In the first nine months of 2017, the company’s business acquisitions (net of cash) amounted to $2,582 million. In this regard, the buyouts of the tools business of Newell Brands known as Newell Tools as well as Craftsman tool brand from Sears Holdings are worth mentioning. These takeovers were completed in March 2017.The company anticipates Newell Brands to strengthen its tools business through deeper penetration into markets worldwide while the Craftsman brand will likely complement its global tools and storage brands as well as open new business opportunities, especially in the lawn and garden end-markets.Also, divestment of non-core businesses has proven beneficial over time. In February, the company sold a majority portion of its Mechanical Security businesses to dormakaba.Shareholders’ Return: Stanley Black & Decker has a solid history of returning value to its shareholders. The company paid cash dividends of approximately $267.9 million and repurchased common shares worth $16.2 million for treasury in the first nine months of 2017. Notably, the quarterly rate was hiked by 8.6% in July this year.In the years ahead, the company wishes to follow its 50/50 capital allocation strategy of acquisitions as well as reward shareholders. Dividend payout is predicted to be 30-35% in the long run.We believe anticipated growth in earnings, a solid cash flow and a favorable payout ratio will ensure healthy dividend payments by the company going forward.Healthy ’17 Guidance & Long-Term Targets: Stanley Black & Decker anticipates improving organic revenues (predicted to grow 6% year over year), operational excellence and synergistic benefits from acquired assets to be gainful in 2017. Banking on these aspects, the company has increased its earnings forecast to $7.33-$7.43 per share from the previous projection of $7.18-$7.38. The revised guidance represents year-over-year growth of 13-14%.By 2022, Stanley Black & Decker aims at generating revenues of approximately $22 billion while revenue rise is predicted at 10-12% (CAGR) range including organic sales growth of 4-6% and acquisition revenues of roughly $6-$8 million. Earnings per share are forecast to grow 10-12% or roughly 6-8%, excluding buyouts. Healthy segmental performance is anticipated with Industrial revenues of $5-$6 billion, Tools & Storage revenues of $12-$14 billion and Security revenues in the $3-$4 billion range.Over the last six months, shares of Stanley Black & Decker have yielded 18.9% return, outperforming the gain of 15.8% recorded by the industry it belongs to.Factors Working Against Stanley Black & DeckerRising Costs & Huge Debt Level: Stanley Black & Decker is suffering the perils of escalated costs and expenses. In the first nine months of 2017, the company’s cost of sales increased 9.6% year over year while selling, general and administrative expenses grew by 12.7%. We believe, if unchecked, rising costs and expenses can hurt the company’s margins in the quarters ahead. Also, a high-debt level can lead to heightened financial obligations, posing serious threats to the company’s financial health. Exiting the third quarter, the company’s long-term debt was approximately $3,818 million.Threat From Industry Competition: Stanley Black & Decker faces stiff competition across all business segments from companies offering similar products and services or those producing different items for same uses.Companies operating in the same industry include Kennametal Inc. (KMT  -  Free Report), Actuant Corp. (ATU  -  Free Report) and Lincoln Electric Holdings, Inc. (LECO  -  Free Report).Adversaries Emerging from Global Uncertainty: End markets served by Stanley Black & Decker are highly susceptible to volatile global economic conditions. Also, lower level of industrial activities and difficult housing market conditions in the countries where the company operates will adversely impact its sales, earnings and cash flow.Also, business expansion in foreign nations has exposed the company to risks emanating from adverse movements in foreign currencies and geo-political issues.Other Headwinds: Realization of synergies drawn from acquisitions is highly dependent on Stanley Black & Decker’s ability to successfully integrate these within the specific time frame. Any failure in prosperous consolidation will affect the company’s future growth prospects. Moreover, the company remains vulnerable to price fluctuations of raw materials procured from suppliers both in the United States and the international markets.Zacks’ Best Private Investment IdeasWhile we are happy to share many articles like this on the website, our best recommendations and most in-depth research are not available to the public.Starting today, for the next month, you can follow all Zacks' private buys and sells in real time.

137,SWK,"We have issued an updated research report on Actuant Corporation (ATU  -  Free Report) on Dec 6. Strengthening Industrial and Engineered Solutions businesses as well as the company’s efforts to reshape its Energy portfolio will prove beneficial. However, the growth momentum might get restricted by headwinds rising from international exposure, industry competition and existing risks in the energy market.Actuant currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Below we briefly discuss the company’s potential growth drivers and possible headwinds.Factors Favoring ActuantStrengthening Business: Actuant anticipates gaining from its Industrial and Engineered Solutions businesses in the quarters ahead. The Industrial segment primarily serves the general maintenance and repair, industrial, infrastructure and production automation industries, while the Engineered Solutions segment mainly targets transportation markets.Notably, healthy demand for industrial tools across all key end markets drove the Industrial revenue growth of 6.7% in fourth-quarter fiscal 2017. Also, solid customer production rates in almost all the off-highway markets and solid demand from China’s heavy-duty truck original equipment manufacturers increased Engineered Solutions’ revenues by 18.3%. The company believes that these positives will continue in the quarters ahead as well.Inorganic Initiatives Drive Growth Opportunities: Acquired assets have over time helped Actuant leverage benefits from easy penetration into unexplored markets and expanded product offerings. In this regard, the recently acquired assets of Mirage Machines — a manufacturer of industrial and energy maintenance tools — from Acteon Group Limited is worth mentioning. The company believes that the addition of Mirage Machines will broaden its product offerings in the flange facing and hot tapping categories. Specifically, the buyout will complement the Energy segment’s Hydratight business and create rental and service business opportunities.In addition to acquisitions, divestment of non-core assets is Actuant’s another way of strengthening its core businesses. Recently, the company divested its Viking SeaTech business to Acteon Group Limited. The business primarily delivered mooring solutions in the offshore oil & gas exploration, drilling and well development end markets. The company anticipates that the Viking divestment will limit its exposure to upstream, offshore oil & gas markets.Both these transactions were in sync with Actuant’s intention of streamlining its Energy business to provide superior benefits to shareholders.Fiscal 2018 Guidance: Actuant anticipates core sales to remain flat to improve 2% in fiscal 2018 compared with 4% decline recorded in fiscal 2017. Results in the first half will likely remain flat while are expected to grow in low single digits in the second half. Total revenues are predicted to come within the $1,100-$1,130 million range, above $1,096 million generated in fiscal 2017.The company predicts the fiscal year’s earnings per share to come within the $1.05-$1.15 range, above 83 cents in fiscal 2017.Factors Working Against ActuantPoor Share Price Performance & Valuation: In the last three months, Actuant’s shares have yielded 6.3% return, underperforming 13.6% growth of the industry.Also, on a P/E (TTM) basis, Actuant looks overvalued compared with the industry with respective tallies of 32x and 24.5x in the last three-month period. This makes us cautious on the stock.Adversaries Rising From Energy Segment: Actuant’s Energy segment primarily deals with technical products and services — joint integrity tools & connectors and cable & rope solutions — useful to the energy markets. Popular brands under the segment are Hydratight, Morgrip, Cortland and Jeyco, among others. Notably, in fourth-quarter fiscal 2017, poor upstream offshore oil & gas demand, as well as lower sales accrued from the Hydratight business marred the segment’s sales by 24.9%. The company believes prevalent energy market challenges would continue to dent its growth in the quarters ahead.Threat From Industry Competition and International Expansion: Actuant faces active competition in each business segment. Extensive business rivalry increases the bargaining power of end users and thus, exposes the company to risks of market share loss. In order to retain competitive power, the company is forced to incur heavy innovation investments, which adds to its aggregate debt level.In addition, business expansion in foreign nations has exposed Actuant to risks arising from adverse movements in foreign currencies and geo-political issues. In fiscal 2017, the company sourced nearly 56% of its revenues from businesses outside the United States.Earnings Estimates & Key PicksActuant’s earnings estimates for fiscal 2018 (ending August 2018) and fiscal 2019 remained stable in the last 60 days. Currently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.08 for fiscal 2018 and $1.32 for fiscal 2019.Some stocks worth considering in the machinery industry are Kennametal Inc. (KMT  -  Free Report), Stanley Black & Decker, Inc. (SWK  -  Free Report) and Altra Industrial Motion Corporation (AIMC  -  Free Report). While Kennametal sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), both Stanley Black & Decker and Altra Industrial Motion carry a Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Kennametal’s earnings for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019 improved in the last 60 days.

143,SWK,"Machinery company Actuant Corporation (ATU  -  Free Report) announced that it has successfully divested its Viking SeaTech business to Acteon Group Limited and acquired Mirage Machines, Ltd. from the same. Both these transactions were originally announced on Aug 16.Viking SeaTech business was part of Actuant’s Energy segment and primarily delivered mooring solutions in the offshore oil & gas exploration, drilling and well development end markets. On the other hand, Mirage Machines manufactures industrial and energy maintenance tools. Details of the Twin TransactionsAs noted, the Viking SeaTech business generated roughly $20 million revenues in the trailing 12 months. Actuant received proceeds of approximately $12 million from Acteon for this divestment.For Mirage Machines acquisition, the company paid roughly $16 million to Acteon and promised additional consideration based on future performance.In fiscal 2017 (ended August 2017), Actuant recorded impairment and divestiture related charges of $117 million while predicts to incur $15-$20 million of these charges in second-quarter fiscal 2018. Benefits From the TransactionsIn fourth-quarter fiscal 2017, Actuant’s Energy segment’s sales totaled $68.6 million, decreasing 24.9% year over year. Core sales dipped 25% year over year. Poor upstream offshore oil & gas demand and lower sales accrued from the company’s Hydratight business, dented the segment’s sales in the quarter.Actuant believes that both these transactions were in sync with its intention of streamlining its Energy business to provide superior benefits to shareholders. The Viking divestment will limit the company’s exposure to upstream, offshore oil & gas markets while the addition of Mirage Machines will broaden product offerings in the flange facing and hot tapping categories. Specifically, the buyout will complement the Energy segment’s Hydratight business and create rental and service business opportunities.In a month, the company’s shares have yielded 4.1% return, outperforming 2.6% gain of the industry. Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to ConsiderWith a market capitalization of nearly $1.6 billion, Actuant currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

144,SWK,"The cyclical nature of industrial machinery demand is benefiting from the synchronized global growth backdrop. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) recently raised its outlook for the global economy, with the financial institution anticipating the world economy to grow 3.6% in 2017. It expects 2.2% rise in advanced economies and 4.6% growth in emerging nations. Global output is projected to increase 3.7% in 2018, including 2% growth for advanced nations and 4.9% improvement for emerging countries.We believe that continuous advancements in technologies applied in agriculture and mining industries keep demand strong for farming and mining machinery. Moreover, healthy growth in demand for packaged foods and beverages across nations, especially in emerging countries, are significantly increasing the use of highly sophisticated food processing and packaging equipment. Further, need for better infrastructure and residential and non-residential spaces require heavy construction machineries.Machinery stocks are broadly grouped under Industrial Products, one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors. The sector has performed well, yielding a solid return of 18.3% year to date. This outpaces growth of 16.9% recorded by the S&P 500 and roughly 13.2% by the NYSE Composite.Among the S&P 500 members, the top five industrial machinery gainers since the beginning of the year include Caterpillar, Inc. (CAT  -  Free Report), Stanley Black & Decker, Inc. (SWK  -  Free Report), Deere & Company (DE  -  Free Report), Roper Technologies, Inc. (ROP  -  Free Report) and Rockwell Automation Inc. (ROK  -  Free Report). The poor performers include Flowserve Corp. (FLS  -  Free Report), Emerson Electric Co. (EMR  -  Free Report) and Eaton Corp., PLC (ETN  -  Free Report).Industrial Machinery: DescriptionIndustrial production is one of the leading economic indicators for industrial machinery stocks. It measures the level of output of manufacturing, mining and utilities sectors in a country. A brief discussion on the machinery industry in different nations is given below.The United States: The country’s industrial production increased2.9% year over year in October driven by impressive growth in mining, manufacturing and utilities output. In September, industrial production increased 1.6% year over year.In addition, a few indicators point toward healthy operating conditions in the industry. Per the U.S. Census Bureau report,new orders for U.S.-manufactured machinery increased 6.4% in the first nine months of 2017 led by growth in orders for construction, mining, industrial, material handling and other machineries.Also, the job market showed strength, with the recent data indicating 261,000 new job additions in October. Average of new job additions in the last three months was 162,000 (accounting for hurricane affects). The unemployment rate dropped 10 basis points (bps) to 4.1%. Also, the country’s GDP has advanced 3% in the July-September quarter.We believe that implementation of the Trump government’s growth policies, especially the proposed $1 trillion spending on infrastructure improvement, will be a boon for industrial machinery stocks. Other tailwinds are the strengthening housing and commercial construction markets in the country. To continue supporting the growing economy, the Federal Reserve has hiked its interest rates twice this year while another one might be expected in December.The IMF projects the U.S. economy to grow 2.2% in 2017 and 2.3% in 2018. These estimates represent increase of 10 bps from the previous projection for 2017 and 20 bps for 2018.Japan: The country’s economy is struggling with internal issues including low investment levels, an aging population and huge public debt.Also, the consumption level has failed to revive to a satisfactory standard since it suffered from a 3% rise in national sales tax in April 2014.However, strengthening exports driven by rise in automobile and electronic shipments have supported the country’s annualized GDP growth of 1.4% in the third quarter compared with the previous quarter. In addition, we believe that initiatives to improve wages are likely to spur domestic demand as well as steps to increase investments domestically might work in the country’s favor in the quarters ahead.According to the report from Japan’s Cabinet Office, core machinery orders (an indicator of capital spending by companies in the next six to nine months)increased 4.7% in third-quarter 2017. However, the same is predicted to be quite different in the fourth quarter, with total machinery orders likely to decline 1.9%. Core orders are expected to fall 3.5%, orders from manufacturing clients will likely drop 9.4% and that from government clients might decline 3.3%.The IMF increased its growth projection for the country by 20 bps to 1.5% for 2017 and by 10 bps to 0.7% for 2018.China: China’s GDP grew 6.8% from the year-earlier period in the third quarter. However, this improvement was slightly below 6.9% registered in the previous quarter as a rise in retail sales and higher exports were partially offset by weak expansion in infrastructure investments.The country’s industrial production improved 6.6% year over year in September on the back of improvement in manufacturing and utilities sectors, offset by weakness in the mining sector. Industrial production in October grew 6.2%.For 2017, the Chinese government anticipates economy to grow roughly 6.5%. We believe that implementation of the government’s plan to spend more than $2 trillion for the development of infrastructure and transportation by 2020 will boost the economy and spur demand for industrial machinery.The IMF projects the Chinese economy to grow 6.8% in 2017 and 6.5% in 2018, up roughly 10 bps from the respective previous estimates.India: The country is currently witnessing the after-effects of some major reforms —demonetization and goods and services tax — implemented in the trailing 12 months. These economic decisions along with other strategies to make the country a prime manufacturing hub for all nations across the world are expected to drive its economic growth going forward.A favorable domestic job market, low interest rates allowing easy accessibility to cheap loans, infrastructure investments, healthy export demand and better monsoon conditions are additional factors that can make the country a favorable investment destination.The country’s industrial production decelerated to 3.8% in September 2017, having expanded 4.5% in the previous month. Production suffered from weakness in mining and electricity outputs. In the first half of fiscal 2017 (ended September), industrial production expanded 2.5% year over year.According to the IMF, the country is projected to grow 6.7% in 2017 and 7.4% in 2018, down roughly 50 bps and 30 bps from the respective previous estimates.Brazil: One of the major road blocks for the Brazilian economy are the political uncertainties which have gripped the nation, somewhat jeopardizing its growth opportunities. Corruption charges against its president are believed to be one of the reasons behind the country’s poor investment grade ratings. Moreover, low private investments, inadequate infrastructure and still a high unemployment rate of 12.4% are other major hurdles.Partially negating the impact of these aspects, growth in export demand and efforts to implement a new pension reform targeting the curbing of public debt are currently strengthening hopes of a turnaround in the Brazilian economy. Also, falling inflation have prompted the countries’ Central Bank to ease interest rates. Notably, the interest rate has been lowered by 75 bps in October, this being its ninth consecutive rate cut since October 2016.In addition, the country’s industrial production has been encouraging since the beginning of the year. Per the latest data, industrial production in September grew 2.6% from the year-ago comparable month.The IMF expects the country’s output to grow 0.7% in 2017, reflecting a 40 bps increase from the previous forecast. Also, growth projection for 2018 has been increased by 20 bps to 1.5%.Eurozone: The region, amidst all the political uncertainties, is showing slight improvement in export demand and labor markets. The region’s GDP has improved 2.5% year over year in third-quarter 2017 while industrial production has improved 3.3% year over year in September. The unemployment rate at September end was 8.9% versus 9% at the end of the previous month.The region’s GDP when compared with the previous quarter inched up 0.6% versus 0.7% recorded in the second quarter. Industrial production, on a month-on-month basis, fell 0.6% in September.The IMF increased output growth estimates by 20 bps both for 2017 and 2018 to 2.1% and 1.9%, respectively.Sector and Industry RankingOf the 16 Zacks sector, Industrial Products is currently in the top 25%, holding the fourth position. The Zacks sectors comprise 265 industries that are ranked on the basis of earnings outlook of constituent companies in each industry. As a rule, we put our X industries (all 265 of them) into two groups: the top half (i.e., industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank).Over the last 10 years, using a one-week rebalance, the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than two to one. (To learn more visit: About Zacks Industry Rank)The machinery industry comprises stocks that primarily deals with manufacturing and supplying farm equipment (currently such stocks collectively carry Zacks Industry Rankof 17), construction and mining equipment (ranked 5), industrial electronics (ranked 186), electrical products (ranked 115), thermal products (ranked 28), material handling products (ranked 28), printing equipment for industrial use (ranked 115), industrial tools and providing related services (ranked 20) and companies serving general industrial purposes are ranked 62.Going by the Zacks rule, we see that machinery sub-industries, except for one, fall in the top half. These sub-industries can be of interest to investors seeking exposure in the machinery industry.Performance and Earnings Trend of the SectorPer the Zacks Earnings Trends report dated Nov 16, roughly 470 of S&P 500 companies reported results for the July-September quarter, with 72.3% beating earnings estimates and 66.5% surpassing revenue projections.Of the Industrial Products stocks, roughly 95.8% reported results til Nov 16. Earnings grew 16.7% year over year, with roughly 65.2% companies beating estimates. Revenues improved 2.9%, with a sales beat of 69.6%.In the quarter, the S&P 500 companies collectively are projected to deliver earnings growth of 6.5% and sales growth of 5.8%. Seeing the results so far and the favorable operating conditions, we believe that the overall performance of the Industrial Products sector will be encouraging. Earnings for industrial stocks are projected to grow 18.7% while sales to increase 4.5%.Our TakeIt will be interesting to watch the activities of companies, with at least $20 billion market capitalization, including Caterpillar, Inc., ABB Ltd. (ABB  -  Free Report), Illinois Tool Works Inc. (ITW  -  Free Report), Parker-Hannifin Corp. (PH  -  Free Report), Ingersoll-Rand PLC (IR  -  Free Report) and Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.In the S&P 500 group, a major machinery company is Caterpillar. It has a market capitalization of $82.7 billion and currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). In the next three to five years, the company’s earnings are predicted to grow 10.3%.Earnings for Deere & Company are predicted to grow 8%. It currently has $48 billion market capitalization and Zacks Rank of #1.The company’s long-term growth prospects seem bright on the back of increasing population, rising living standards, investments in new products and expansion in unexplored geographies.Internal requirements as well as export orders play a key role in determining the demand for industrial machineries in any country. We believe that efforts to improve trade relations across nations will be a boon for machinery companies. Also, increase in infrastructural investments, job creation and high consumer-end demand will help in accelerating growth.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization.

145,SWK,"Stanley Black & Decker, Inc. (SWK  -  Free Report) has been in the limelight following its stellar third-quarter performance and increased projections for 2017. However, its dividend yield — currently at its lowest level since 2011 — raises our concern.Before we proceed, a quick discussion on the relevance of dividend yield and the company’s dividend history might be helpful.What Dividend Yield Means? By definition, dividend yield is the percentage of the company’s dividend per share paid in a year relative to the stock price. In addition, a forward dividend yield can also be calculated by using the proposed quarterly dividend rate or the last paid quarterly dividend and multiplying the same by four in place of actual dividend paid in a year.High dividend yields generally mean that the company believes in rewarding its shareholders handsomely through dividend payments. These stocks can be suitable investment options for investors seeking constant returns. However, we believe that such rewards sometimes come at the expense of opportunities lost for using resources in enhancing the company’s growth prospects. Additionally, high dividend yield might also indicate that the company is currently undervalued when compared with its strong fundamentals and vice versa.Stanley Black & Decker’s Dividend HistoryThis industrial tools maker has a solid history of returning value to its shareholders. It has been paying annual dividends for the last 141 consecutive years while regular quarterly payments are roughly 490 quarters old. Also, since 1968, the company has hiked its dividend rate every year.Specifically, the company’s annual dividend rate has been hiked six times from $1.64 per share in 2011 to $2.52 in 2017. Despite increments in the annual rate, we see that the company’s dividend yield has moved south from roughly 2.4% in 2011 to 2% in 2016. It currently is 1.5%.Impact of Falling DividendGoing by numbers, a falling dividend yield might be a concerning factor for Stanley Black & Decker. An investor interested in regular flow of income might be unhappy with these statistics, unless the company uses another dividend rate hike as bait.However, we believe that the other side of this picture needs to be considered before drawing any conclusions. Since 2011, the company’s share price has increased roughly 150.7%, clearly outpacing the growth of 53.7% in the company’s annual dividend rate. This share price rally has been largely responsible for the company’s falling dividend yields over the years. Also, the current scenario suggests that the stock is overvalued. So, is it the time to rethink about the stock?Our TakeWe believe that Stanley Black & Decker can still be considered a suitable investment option, as evident from its current Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The stock might interest investors, who along with regular cash flow are also interested in capital gains.Stanley Black & Decker’s earnings per share have grown from $5.24 in 2011 to $6.51 in 2016. For the current year, the company anticipates earnings to be within the $7.33-$7.43 per share range (increased from the previous projection of $7.18-$7.38). The mid-point of the revised guidance reflects 13.4% increase from the year-ago tally. Benefits accrued from higher organic revenue growth (of roughly 6%), operational excellence and synergistic gains from acquired assets are predicted to be primary growth drivers. Its solid product portfolio gives it a competitive edge over the other players like Kennametal Inc. (KMT  -  Free Report), Actuant Corporation (ATU  -  Free Report) and Lincoln Electric Holdings, Inc. (LECO  -  Free Report), in the industry.By 2022, the company aims to become a well diversified industrial company. Total revenues are anticipated to grow roughly 10-12% (CAGR), including organic sales growth of 4-6% and acquisition revenues of roughly $6-$8 million. Earnings per share are predicted to grow 10-12% or roughly 6-8% excluding acquisitions. Healthy segmental performance is anticipated with Industrial revenues of $5-$6 billion, Tools & Storage revenues of $12-$14 billion and Security revenues in the $3-$4 billion range. Free cash flow will be greater than or equal to net income.The company’s dividend payout was 34.1% in the third quarter, better than 32.5% for the peer group. Also, its current dividend yield of 1.5% is above 1.2% for the peer group.Anticipated growth in earnings, solid cash flow and favorable payout ratio will ensure healthy dividend payments. These positive aspects along with solid long-term opportunities are expected to consistently boost the company’s share price, resulting in capital gains to investors.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

Also, early indications suggest that the budget may increase again in 2018.Should this authorization pass, the company can likely win a string of new task orders for upgrades, design projects and accelerated cleanups.However, sluggish oil and gas markets, and a very competitive bidding environment (particularly in Canada) have restricted this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company’s top-line growth in recent times.Looking forward, oil and gas revenues, largely in Canada, are expected to reduce about 65% in the second half of fiscal 2017.Thus, we believe depressed oil and gas prices will continue to play a spoilsport for the company’s revenues in the oil and gas midstream services business.Stocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked stocks in the broader space include Kennametal Inc.

148,SWK,"A key yardstick of manufacturing activity in the United States scaled a 13-year high in September, thanks to two major hurricanes. Increased demand for rebuilding supplies somewhat drove manufacturing activity.The improvement was largely driven by strength in new orders, while other survey components including measures of production, export orders and employment grew at a faster clip in September. Banking on such bullish trends, investing in stocks from the manufacturing sector might prove lucrative now. Factory Activity Surged in SeptemberAccording to the Institute of Supply Management (ISM), the manufacturing index climbed to 60.8% in September from 58.8% in August, scaling the highest since May 2004. Notably, 17 of the 18 industries reported growth last month, led by textile mills and machinery. Only one industry, furniture manufacturing, witnessed a decline.Nevertheless, such an unusually high number of industries reporting expansion reflected underlying economic strength that’s been developing over the last eight years. The economy, in fact, expanded 3.1% in the second quarter due to an uptick in consumer spending on strength in the labor market.Any reading above 50 indicates increased factory activity, which accounts for 12% of the U.S. economy. The ISM survey, in fact, showed that the manufacturing index has remained above the desired level for the last 13 months. Here’s a look at how the index fared this year:MonthIndex Reading (%)January56.0February57.7March57.2April54.8May54.9June57.8July56.3August58.8September60.8Average for 2017 - 57.1High - 60.8Low - 54.8(Source: Institute for Supply Management)Inside the ReportNew orders, production, new export orders and hiring increased last month. The index of new orders jumped 4.3 points to 64.6%. Orders are also expected to remain strong in the coming months as inventory level remained at a six-year low.  Timothy R. Fiore, Chair of the ISM, added that “order input continues at a strong pace averaging 61.6 percent since December 2016 setting the pace for production activity.” The nation’s production has been strong, courtesy of higher global demand and U.S. capital outlays. The production index increased 1.2 points to 62.2%. The ISM survey also showed a pickup in its measure of exports since producers benefitted from a weaker dollar this year, which made U.S. products less expensive in foreign markets. Meanwhile, the ISM’s order backlogs index surged to its highest level since April 2011, which explains why more manufacturing hubs are stepping up hiring. The ISM survey indicated that a measure of employment rose to 60.3%, its strongest reading since 2011.What Lifted Manufacturing Activity?U.S. factory activity hit record highs last month after hurricanes Harvey and Irma disrupted supplies but drove demand for manufactured goods. Harvey, the first major hurricane to hit the U.S. mainland in almost 12 years, had put vast areas under water. The onslaught of the torrential rainfall followed the storm, which originated in the Gulf of Mexico. The rainstorm originated from a tropical depression which rapidly ballooned from a Category 1 hurricane to Category 4. Harvey had forced the shutdown of Houston-area refineries and chemical plants, while several car dealerships and merchandise were destroyed.While Houston, Texas and other parts of the Gulf reeled under the effects of Harvey, Irma hit the Sun Shine state of Florida. Irma is the most powerful Atlantic hurricane on record, which has caused widespread devastation in Florida as well as the French Caribbean island territories.5 Top Manufacturing Stocks to Buy NowThe latest reading of the ISM survey reinforces the view that manufacturing activities are growing at a rapid pace and are likely to expand in the days ahead. Hence, picking manufacturing stocks seems to be a smart option at this moment. We have, thus, selected five stocks that sport a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Such stocks also boost a VGM Score of A or B.

After today’s market close, we expect another wave of Q3 reports from companies such as AT&T (T  -  Free Report) and Chipotle (CMG  -  Free Report). But let’s dig in with the breakfast portion of earnings results:Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)-rated Caterpillar (CAT  -  Free Report) is up 7% in pre-market trading following its blowout results in Q3 earnings and revenues. Its bottom line of $1.77 per share amounts to a 45% positive earnings surprise over the $1.22 in the Zacks consensus, and miles ahead of the 85 cents per share in CAT’s fiscal Q3 2016. Sales reached $11.4 billion, far surpassing the $10.6 billion expected and $9.2 billion a year ago. Construction growth in China and on-shore oil & gas businesses in North America drove quarterly growth most notably.Remarkably, CAT’s 45% earnings surprise is roughly in-line with the heavy machinery manufacturer’s trailing four quarters of earnings beats, bolstered by a Q1 2017 surprise of more than 100%.

154,SWK,"We have issued an updated research report on industrial tool maker, Stanley Black & Decker, Inc. (SWK  -  Free Report) on Sep 26. We believe that this machinery stock is poised to benefit from solid long-term growth opportunities. The company’s earnings are projected to grow 10.3% in the next three to five years.In the first half of 2017, the company’s shares yielded 23.8% return. Below we briefly discuss the company’s potential growth drivers.Diversification Benefits: We believe Stanley Black & Decker is poised to benefit from its diversified customer base in the educational, financial and healthcare institutions as well as in the commercial, governmental and industrial end markets. Its Security segment deals with mechanical and electronic security products as well as a variety of security services. Its Industrial segment manufactures and markets mechanic tools and storage systems, engineered healthcare storage systems, hydraulic tools and accessories, plumbing, heating and air conditioning tools, assembly tools and systems, and specialty tools. Its Tools & Storage segment deals in hand tools, consumer mechanical tools, storage systems, pneumatic tools and fasteners.Furthermore, international diversity has played a major role in Stanley Black & Decker’s profitability over time. Notably, in second-quarter 2017, it derived nearly 55% of net revenues from its operations in the United States while the rest were secured from Canada, Europe, Emerging markets, Japan and Australia.We believe that such diversified business structure makes the company more competitive compared with other major players in the industry like Actuant Corporation (ATU  -  Free Report), Kennametal Inc. (KMT  -  Free Report) and Lincoln Electric Holdings, Inc. (LECO  -  Free Report).Inorganic Initiatives: Over the past few months, Stanley Black & Decker has been restructuring its business portfolio. In March 2017, it acquired Newell Tools, the tools business of Newell Brands and the Craftsman tool brand from Sears Holdings. While Newell Tools is anticipated to strengthen the company’s tools business through deeper penetration into markets worldwide, the Craftsman brand will enhance the company’s global tools and storage product offerings and open new business opportunities, especially in the lawn and garden end markets. Additionally, in February, the company sold a majority portion of its Mechanical Security businesses to dormakaba. The estimated after-tax cash proceeds of approximately $700 million from the deal can be utilized for boosting more attractive businesses in the company’s portfolio.Shareholders’ Return: Share buybacks and dividend payments are the prime means of returning value to shareholders for Stanley Black & Decker.

157,SWK,"Actuant Corporation (ATU  -  Free Report) reported mixed fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 (ended Aug 31, 2017) results. The company claimed that benefits accrued from robust performance of both Industrial and Engineered Solutions’ segments were offset by weak Energy segment results.   EarningsQuarterly adjusted earnings came in at 19 cents per share, lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 21 cents. The bottom-line also fell short of the year-ago tally of 30 cents per share.Adjusted earnings for fiscal 2017 was 83 cents per share compared to $1.22 recorded in the year-ago comparable period.RevenuesNet sales in the reported quarter was $275.7 million, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $266 million. However, the top-line slightly fell short of the year ago tally of $275.8 million.Net sales for fiscal 2017 was $1,095.8 million compared to $1,149.4 million recorded in the year-ago period.  Segment DetailsIndustrial segment’s sales during the quarter came in at $100.3 million, climbing 6.7% year over year. The upside was driven by sturdy demand for industrial tool across all key end-markets. Core sales of the segment grew 5% year over year, primarily on the back of weaker U.S. dollar.Engineered Solutions segment’s revenues were $106.8 million, up 18.3% year over year. The upside was stemmed by solid customer production rates in almost all the off-highway markets. In addition, the Chinese heavy-duty truck original equipment manufacturer’s demand remained robust during the reported quarter. Core sales of the segment improved 20% year over year, on the back of Sanlo spin-off as well as favorable foreign currency translation impact.  Energy segment’s sales came in at $68.6 million, dropping 24.9% year over year. Core sales of the segment also dipped 25% year over year. Poor upstream offshore oil & gas demand, as well as lower sales accrued from the company’s Hydratight business, dented the segment’s sales in the quarter.Costs and MarginsCost of goods sold in the fiscal fourth quarter declined inched down 0.2% year over year to $179.2 million. Gross profit margin in the quarter came in at 35%, up 10 basis points (bps) year over year.Selling, administrative and engineering expenses were $71.9 million, up 11.8% year over year.Adjusted operating profit margin was 7.1%, down 250 bps year over year.Gross margin for fiscal 2017 was 34.7% compared to 35.1% recorded in the year-ago period. While adjusted operating margin for fiscal 2017 was 7.5%, down 170 bps year over year.  Balance Sheet and Cash FlowExisting fiscal 2017, Actuant had cash and cash equivalents worth $229.6 million, higher than $179.6 million recorded at the end of fiscal 2016. Long-term debt totaled $531.9 million, down from $561.7 million recorded on Aug 31, 2016.In the quarter under review, Actuant provided cash worth $36.4 million from operating activities, down 14.7% year over year. Capital expenditures came in at $5.3 million compared to $4.6 million registered in the year-ago quarter.OutlookActuant intends to boost its near-term results on the back of lean revitalization, sales effectiveness, and portfolio actions. The company anticipates to report revenues within $260-$270 million and adjusted earnings within 14-19 cents in in first-quarter fiscal 2018.The company anticipates to report revenues within the range of $1.100-1.130 billion in fiscal 2018, estimating a core sales rise of 2%. Adjusted earnings for fiscal 2018 is anticipated to lie within the range of $1.05-$1.15 per share.Our TakeActuant conducts business in the highly competitive the Manufacturing-Tools & Related Products industry. Lincoln Electric Holdings, Inc. (LECO  -  Free Report), Sandvik AB (SDVKY  -  Free Report) and Stanley Black & Decker, Inc. (SWK  -  Free Report) are some major companies dominating this industry.Actuant is steadily reinforcing its business with strategic commercial effectiveness actions and lean revitalization moves. Moreover, near-term profitability and cash flow will likely improve on the back of the sound restructuring moves.However, we believe that challenging conditions prevalent in the global energy market might hurt Actuant’s top- and bottom-line performances going forward. In addition, the company believes a stronger U.S. dollar might dent its overseas’ revenues and profitability in the near term.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

The spin-off from Alcoa (AA  -  Free Report) in Q4 2016 also bumped up its 2017 EPS guidance from $1.15 per share to $1.20. The company appears to be on fairly sound footing considering the shakeup not only regarding the spin-off but the sudden departure of former CEO Klaus Kleinfeld this past spring.
