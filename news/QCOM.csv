0,QCOM,"Wall Street analysts are giving thumbs down to Broadcom's (AVGO) planned acquisition of CA Technologies (CA), saying the deal will muddle the chipmaker's strategic focus.Broadcom stock received several downgrades and price-target cuts on Thursday after the company announced its purchase of CA Technologies late Wednesday. At least five Wall Street firms downgraded their ratings on Broadcom stock and four others cut their price targets on the news.Nomura Instinet analyst Romit Shah kept his neutral rating on Broadcom but cut his price target to 225 from 250.""This deal hurts management's credibility,"" Shah said.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBroadcom shares plummeted 13.7% to 209.98 on the stock market today. CA shares soared 18.7% to 44.15. Broadcom agreed to pay $44.50 a share in cash for CA in a deal worth $18.9 billion.The deal is out of character for Broadcom, which historically has bought other chipmakers. CA makes software for managing information technology systems. Broadcom said the acquisition will create a leading infrastructure technology company.After Broadcom's pursuit of Qualcomm (QCOM) failed earlier this year, the company said it would focus on delivering shareholder value through organic growth, capital return and tuck-in acquisitions, Shah said.Broadcom's move to buy CA Technologies comes ""out of left field,"" he said. ""CA is a legacy software company that specializes in mainframes — shared synergies are not obvious.""The deal also raises questions about long-term growth prospects for Broadcom's core wireless and wired communications chip businesses, Shah said.B. Riley FBR analyst Craig Ellis lowered his rating on Broadcom to neutral from buy and slashed his price target to 245 from 308.He compared the deal to chipmaker Intel's (INTC) purchase of security software firm McAfee. Intel had trouble rationalizing that purchase and ultimately sold McAfee to a private equity firm.Evercore ISI analyst C.J. Muse lowered his rating on Broadcom stock to in-line from buy.The CA purchase lacks strategic rationale and seems more like ""financial engineering"" and a private equity play, he said.""Further, investors will likely be concerned on a 'loss of focus' in terms of broadening exposure outside of semiconductors,"" he said in a report.""We note that CA Technologies had been in the process of selling itself and had failed to attract a private equity buyer,"" Muse said. ""With software mainframe revenues in decline and no clear synergies to Broadcom's current revenue streams, we struggle to understand Broadcom's incentive here.""UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri said he is willing to give Broadcom Chief Executive Hock Tan the benefit of the doubt. He noted that Tan has a proven track record of wringing value out of acquisitions.Arcuri maintained his buy rating on Broadcom with a price target of 330.Broadcom could become a consolidator in the infrastructure software space, he said.RELATED:Chip Stocks To Watch And Semiconductor Industry News

1,QCOM,"President Donald Trump met with Republican lawmakers on Wednesday as he seeks to preserve a deal to rescue Chinese communications equipment giant ZTE that may hold the key to averting a bruising China trade war.""We're working on it,"" Trump said of White House efforts to address congressional concerns that going soft on ZTE sends the wrong signal about taking on China over intellectual property theft, which has national security dimensions.Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, a ZTE critic, expressed optimism after the meeting to reports.""I think there's a path forward to address the president's concerns as well as national security,"" Cornyn said.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBy late July, if not sooner, we'll know whether Trump prevailed over Congress and whether a China trade war is really on.On Monday, the Senate voted 85-10 to reinstate a ban on U.S. component suppliers selling their wares to ZTE, without which it's had to halt operations. The move was a direct challenge to Trump, who had softened the Commerce Department's penalty for repeated violations of sanctions on North Korea and Iran and pledged via tweet to get ZTE ""back into business, fast.""If Trump really intended to launch a major China trade war, the last thing on his mind would be saving ZTE's 70,000 Chinese jobs. Yet late Monday, Trump escalated his threats toward China, directing his administration to draw up tariffs on another $200 billion worth of Chinese imports.Investors took the threat seriously, with the Dow Jones industrial average sinking close to 300 points as Caterpillar (CAT), Boeing (BA) and other companies with big exposure to China came under pressure. But Trump's saber-rattling appears aimed at Congress, not Beijing. If Trump appears tough enough on China and lawmakers begin to worry about a full-scale China trade war, they'll be more likely to bow to the White House's wishes with respect to ZTE.The Dow Jones edged lower on Wednesday, declining for a seventh straight session. But the Nasdaq composite hit a record high, advancing 0.7%.If the U.S. backs off its harsh sentence for one of China's premier tech hardware firms, the countries might be able to work on a trade deal that Trump was crowing about just a month ago. China had agreed to buy an additional $70 billion worth of American goods, including ""massive amounts of ADDITIONAL Farm/Agricultural products."" But as the U.S. pushed for further concessions, Beijing appeared to walk away from the bargaining table as the Senate moves put ZTE's fate in jeopardy.While U.S.-China negotiations are suspended, the clock is ticking toward the July 6 start of a trade war. That's when the U.S. said it will apply 25% tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese high-tech imports. Beijing has said that it plans to immediately retaliate, dollar for dollar. Another $16 billion worth of Chinese imports could face tariffs shortly after July 6, pending further review.But the process may come to a standstill if Congress acts quickly. The Senate's ZTE provision is part of a must-pass defense-funding bill. But the Senate version must be merged with House legislation that would apply much narrower restrictions on ZTE. It's not clear whether the final bill will come together before the July 4 recess. So a China trade war could stay on a low boil for the next month or so, until ZTE's fate becomes clear.July 25 is another key date. That's the latest deadline for the Qualcomm (QCOM) merger agreement with NXP Semiconductors (NXPI). Like the rest of the U.S. trade negotiation with China, the deal appears tied to the fate of ZTE. Chinese regulators have refused to grant antitrust approval to the chip merger, but appear ready to do so when the ZTE ban is lifted.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:If You're Long Netflix Or Square, Read ThisThese 2 FANG+ Stocks Are In Buy RangeIBD Stock Of The Day: Online Payment Leader PayPal Hits Buy ZoneStock Market Today: Track Market Trends And The Best Stocks To Watch

3,QCOM,"A U.S. and China trade war has been put on hold, but maybe not for long. For a few weeks this spring, President Trump's Make America Great Again and President Xi Jinping's Made in China 2025 seemed ready to collide. Then came word that China would buy more U.S. goods and the U.S. won't impose harsh new China tariffs.""Be cool, it will all work out!"" Trump tweeted about talks en route to a recent trade deal that China's state-run People's Daily hailed as a ""win-win"" for both countries.Trump's throwback vision — stressing steel, agriculture, autos and oil — may coexist for a while with Xi's prescription for China's centrally planned high-tech, high-income future. But the harmony can't last long in the world's most important economic relationship.Already, Trump, under fire over the China trade truce, said on May 22 it's just a ""start"" and then the following day said talks would likely need a ""different structure."" On Tuesday, the White House said it have tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods set up by June 15, though news reports suggesting that a China trade war was back on appeared premature.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseMore broadly, the largely status quo deal won't alter China's grand plan to overtake America's technological leadership by nearly any means necessary. Ultimately, China and the U.S. could erect barriers in strategic sectors, creating an economic cold war that severs closely integrated global supply chains.Blue-chip giants Boeing (BA), Apple (AAPL) and Intel (INTC) all popped May 21 as Wall Street celebrated Trump's deal with China. While their near-term future in China may be more secure, the longer-term remains as uncertain as ever.Made in China 2025, the 10-year plan set out three years ago, looks like anything but a win-win for the U.S. or any of Beijing's other major trading partners. Through state subsidies, acquisitions, market access rules and sometimes outright cybertheft, Xi is bent on closing the technological gap, dominating domestic markets and establishing global leadership in advanced sectors such as semiconductors, robotics and artificial intelligence.The official aim is to steadily displace foreign components, achieving 40% self-sufficiency by 2020 and 70% by 2025.Concerns over China's techno-military ambitions are only heightened by its One Belt, One Road trillion-dollar vision to command global trade by financing infrastructure across Asia and into the Middle East, Europe and Africa. China also created the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank to rival the World Bank and the D.C. consensus on the global economy.Yet it's unclear if the U.S. has the appetite or strategy to thwart Beijing's ambitions. Just 10 weeks ago Trump tweeted that ""trade wars are good, and easy to win"" and then demanded a $200 billion cut in the China trade gap. Yet rather than move beyond tariff skirmishes to a full-blown U.S. and China trade war, Trump gladly took Beijing's pledge to boost American energy and agricultural purchases somewhat. And that modest concession came after Trump pledged leniency for Chinese telecom equipment giant ZTE, which violated sanctions on Iran and North Korea. ZTE had ceased operations after the U.S. banned American companies from working with it.Why was Trump so quick to relent? He may have favored a unified approach to North Korean diplomacy. Beijing also called his bluff, judging that Trump would have no stomach for a U.S. and China trade war with American farmers in the cross hairs ahead of key midterm elections.Trump also may have realized he had a much weaker hand than he had imagined.His initial threat was a 25% tariff on $50 billion worth of high-tech Chinese imports. But Trump tariffs largely would have hit Chinese ventures of U.S. and other foreign multinationals, the Peterson Institute for International Economics found. The tariffs on mostly intermediate goods would have raised U.S. production costs, hurting competitiveness.""That the tariffs fail to hurt Chinese firms directly should not be a surprise,"" wrote Peterson Institute researchers Mary Lovely and Yang Liang. Made in China 2025 is an aspiration, but current Chinese tech prowess still lags that of the U.S. and others, they noted. ""It is impossible to hit tomorrow's exports with today's tariffs.""Trump said something similar about his desire to go easy on ZTE, tweeting that it ""buys a big percentage of individual parts from U.S. companies.""A Friday report said that the Trump administration has reached a deal to lift ZTE sanctions in exchange for another financial penalty, restructure management and hire U.S. compliance officers.Still, the U.S.-China trade relationship remains uneasy.The Trump administration's sudden shift from wielding a big stick to selling more carrots, so to speak, reflected a long-running split between businesses' short-term financial interests and national security concerns about long-term strategic goals, says American Enterprise Institute resident scholar Derek Scissors.Despite a consensus that America must confront China on trade, both sides ""keep fighting over how tough we should be,"" he told IBD.Likewise, Scissors says, a growing consensus holds that the U.S. must act multilaterally to hold China to account. Even Trump had a change of heart about the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal cobbled together by President Obama to help counter China's influence in East Asia. Trump relentlessly criticized the 12-nation deal in the campaign. He dropped TPP, never ratified by the Senate, on his fourth day in office. But he recently told top economic advisor Larry Kudlow to explore getting back in.Yet saying we should act multilaterally is easier than doing it, says Scissors. He sees no realistic chance for a TPP revival. Instead, Trump is targeting allies with steel and aluminum tariffs and a new probe into auto imports.For now, America's strategic drift and Trump's status-quo trade deal are playing into China's hands. But Scissors says a cold U.S. and China trade war is coming.""We're heading into a cold war with Chinese characteristics,"" Scissors said. ""They aren't the Soviets.""Unlike the USSR, China is a rival but not an enemy. And it's fully integrated with the global economy. ""I don't think it gets as bad,"" Scissors said.Other nations have sought to climb the income ladder via unfair trade policies to build up national champions. Yet ""China now has the wealth, commercial sophistication and technical expertise to make its pursuit of technological leadership work,"" warned James Lewis of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, in a submission to the Trump administration's probe of China's technology and intellectual property practices.It boasts the world's fastest supercomputer, half as many tech unicorns as the U.S. (private companies sporting a $1 billion market cap) and wildly successful public companies such as Baidu (BIDU), Alibaba (BABA), Tencent (TCEHY) that can give U.S. FANG stocks a run for their money.""The fundamental issue for the U.S. and other Western nations, and the IT sector, is how to respond to a managed economy with a well-financed strategy to create a domestic industry intended to displace foreign suppliers.""Yet there's also a clear military dimension to China's ambitions to become the leader in areas including artificial intelligence, robotics and aerospace.The premise behind allowing China to join the World Trade Organization in 2001 was that trade would force its state-run system to gradually converge with market economies. That opened the door for U.S. multinationals to outsource their assembly lines, capitalizing on China's huge pool of low-wage labor. More recently, Chinese companies have been moving up the value chain, aided by strategic deals but also by technology from foreign joint-venture partners as a price of market access.Many have questioned whether the liberal technology policies of the U.S. and other rich nations ever made sense. Yet now that Beijing is directing a $300 billion national ""self-sufficiency"" campaign to minimize reliance on technology from the U.S., Germany, South Korea and others, its bid to buy technology has been met by a chill, if not paranoia.In 2015, when Beijing spelled out Made in China 2025, Chinese investments in U.S. tech startups surged to $9.9 billion from $2.3 billion a year earlier. The tide began to turn at the end of 2016 when President Obama, on the advice of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. (CFIUS), blocked the sale of a German chipmaker's U.S. unit to Grand Chip Investment GMBH, owned by a Chinese company.Last year, President Trump nixed a bid by Chinese investors to buy Lattice Semiconductor. In March, Trump blocked a $117 billion Broadcom (AVGO) offer for Qualcomm (QCOM) on national security grounds. The apparent fear was that Broadcom, ready to move its headquarters to the U.S. from Singapore, would sandbag Qualcomm's 5G wireless R&D and give a leg up to China's Huawei. Facing pressure from U.S. lawmakers, AT&T (T) and Verizon (VZ) this year dropped plans to sell Huawei's new phone in America.Qualcomm has long been in Beijing's sights. China has threatened to derail Qualcomm's merger with Dutch chip firm NXP Semiconductors (NXPI). In 2015, Qualcomm ponied up $1 billion to get out from under a Chinese antitrust probe. Qualcomm seemed to have bought regulatory tolerance, in part by lending its technology to a joint venture with Guizhou Province to produce server chips.China has used such strong-arm tactics to gain proprietary technology, costing U.S. firms upward of $200 billion a year, according to some estimates.But if Beijing won't give up its tacit encouragement of technology transfer as a cost of doing business in China, the U.S. Congress could step into the breach.Congress is weighing legislation to beef up the CFIUS to let it oversee more transactions, including technology transfer agreements, bankruptcy sales and early-stage venture capital deals. The VC industry warns that banning Chinese funds from U.S. investments will push startups to migrate elsewhere.The Trump administration reportedly has mulled curbing Chinese citizens' participation in advanced research at U.S. universities. A Duke University researcher is believed to have transferred knowledge to develop China's new stealth fighter jet.If China continues to resist competitive market dynamics, ""Western nations will naturally turn from managed integration to something more self-protective,"" Daniel Rosen, founding partner of the Rhodium Group research firm, wrote in Foreign Affairs.While products such as toys, furniture and apparel could avoid national security scrutiny, Rosen sees a real risk of disengagement in strategic areas.Countries don't follow Econ 101 textbook examples with trade only in finished goods. Modern supply chains and investment links often involve a myriad of countries for a single product, especially for tech goods.The breakup could happen in stages, as China marches toward Xi's 2025 goals. Or the impact on technology supply chains could be more violent, like a major slow-moving earthquake.Consider the chip industry in which U.S. and China trade frictions are highest. China consumes about 60% of the $412 billion semiconductor market, but three-fourths of those chips are imported (even factoring in foreign multinational output in China). No Chinese firms rank in the top 20 producers. Those chips are then assembled into finished electronics like the Apple iPhone, the bulk of which are shipped overseas. High-tech exports in the first quarter totaled $138 billion.""The cost of disengagement will be severe for China, the United States, and third parties,"" Rosen wrote. ""It is possible that when China and the United States stare these hard realities in the eye, with adjustment costs likely to run into the trillions of dollars over the next decade, they will seek an alternative.""But with Beijing working to ""hardwire its system not to converge,"" a long-term U.S. and China trade war becomes increasingly likely, he said.China's leaders aren't willing to trust their country's future to the free market. Wages in China have leapt above those in Brazil and Mexico and can't compete with Vietnam or India. The working-age population is shrinking and will keep doing so for decades. To a large extent, if China is going to remain the world's manufacturing giant and join the ranks of rich nations, it will have to depend on robots and other technology, such as artificial intelligence.China's ascendancy is hardly a sure thing. ""Like many grandiose ambitions of central planning, the more spectacular elements will likely fall by the wayside,"" Council on Foreign Relations research associate Lorand Laskai wrote of Beijing's AI roadmap. ""However, the plan might still succeed if only because China is committing resources to a societywide AI push"" and reorienting the education system to train Chinese students to work with AI.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Trump Gave Up His Best Leverage In China Trade Talks — For Beans?Alibaba Price-Target Raised On Continued China E-Commerce DominanceThese Stocks Rally After Trump Cancels North Korea SummitBest Chinese Stocks To Buy And WatchShould I Buy Stocks Now?

4,QCOM,"The Dow Jones industrial average and other major stock market averages are tanking Tuesday over President Donald Trump's latest threat of a full-scale trade war with China. Yet Trump's threat seems aimed at Capitol Hill, not Beijing.Here's why: After escalating his threat to impose tariffs on another $200 billion worth of Chinese imports late Monday, Trump will meet with GOP senators on Wednesday and ask them to drop their opposition to his rescue of ZTE, the Chinese communications equipment firm driven out of business by U.S. sanctions.If Trump really intended to launch a trade war, the last thing on his mind would be saving ZTE's 70,000 Chinese jobs.A plunging Dow Jones, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite could help sway Republican senators to give Trump the flexibility he wants to strike a trade deal with China. But while the Dow Jones remained sharply lower at the close, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq pared losses.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseIntraday on the stock market today, among Dow Jones components with big exposure to China, Caterpillar (CAT) lost 3.6% and Boeing (BA) 3.8%. Apple (AAPL) and Nike (NKE) slipped 1.6% and 1.8%, respectively. Intel (INTC) pared its loss to 0.5%. The Dow Jones itself fell 1.15%, undercutting its 50-day moving average and headed for a sixth straight decline.Meanwhile, Deere (DE), which fares well when American farmers are thriving, has seen shares slide about 10% over the past five days. Qualcomm (QCOM), whose merger with NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) appears tied up in U.S.-Chinese trade negotiations, fell 1%.Just a month ago, Trump was crowing about a China trade deal that would see China ""buy massive amounts of ADDITIONAL Farm/Agricultural products"" from the U.S.That deal only came close to happening due to Trump's pledge via a tweet to get ZTE ""back into business, fast."" As punishment for continuing to doing business with Iran and North Korea in defiance of U.S. sanctions against those regimes, the Commerce Department had ordered ZTE's U.S. component suppliers to cease doing business with the firm.But Trump's leniency prompted a backlash. The Senate voted on Monday to attach a provision denying relief to ZTE to a must-pass defense funding bill. The White House has said it opposes the ZTE provision, but a Trump veto of a defense bill to save Chinese jobs would be awkward.Rather than looking weak with a veto, Trump's threat of dramatically escalating tariffs is a show of strength that has scared investors and may also scare Republican senators into backing down.Trump already showed his cards with the underwhelming China trade deal he touted last month. He has no stomach for a trade war that makes American farmers pay the price. He also reportedly told Apple CEO Tim Cook that he won't impose tariffs on Apple iPhones assembled in China. Trump had seemed set to sign onto a deal that would have done relatively little to narrow the massive U.S. trade deficit with China.While the Trump administration has insisted that the enforcement action vs. ZTE was separate from talk talks, it's clear that Chinese President Xi Jinping didn't agree.After Trump's leniency prompted a backlash and left the fate of ZTE hanging in the balance, Chinese trade negotiators frustrated their American counterparts seeking to finalize an agreement and win more concessions. That strengthened the hand of Trump officials who have advocated a hard line vs. China and had Trump's first round of threatened tariffs on $50 billion worth of high-tech Chinese imports all ready to go.Any time such threats are made and deadlines are set, there's risk involved. Beijing has a reputation for refusing to back down from a threat. If talks go nowhere before a July 6 deadline for imposing 25% tariffs on $34 billion in Chinese imports, the trade spat may spiral into something more serious. Yet if Trump follows through on his ZTE rescue, the negotiating environment is likely to improve, and there's probably a deal Trump will accept, at least in the short term.Any trade agreement is likely to please Wall Street, but it's sure to be just a cease-fire in what promises to be a longer term U.S. technological cold war with China.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Forget Trump: Why We're Headed For A Long, Cold U.S. And China Trade WarIf You Missed These Explosive China Stocks, Here's How You Could Get InBest Growth Stocks To Buy And Watch: See Updates To IBD Stock ListsChart Reading For Beginners: What's In A Stock Chart?

Dow Jones stocks Boeing (BA), Caterpillar (CAT) and 3M (MMM), along with NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), Qualcomm (QCOM) and Deere (DE), all should benefit from easing tensions between the world's two largest economies.Meanwhile U.S. Steel (X) and other domestic steel stocks took a hit, even though Chinese steel makes up a small share of U.S. steel imports.The aerospace giant is America's biggest exporter and China is a key customer.

Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBack in April, Morgan Stanley analyst Rajeev Lalwani said the Boeing threat was ""dissipating"" due to Chinese and American policymakers seeking to avoid a trade war, with a mutually beneficial outcome. He noted that China's proposed 25% tariffs on aerospace products would only impact imports of Boeing's 737-700 and MAX 7. They account for less than 1% of Boeing's backlog orders.NXP Semiconductors stock rose 3.3%, to finish at 114.65, as a trade deal increases the chances its takeover by Qualcomm will go through. The stock gapped above its 50-day moving average and hit its 200-day line before retreating.The Dutch company already had climbed on reports that Chinese regulators are looking more favorably upon Qualcomm's attempt to acquire the chipmaker. That came after President Trump signaled he would ease stiff sanctions vs. Chinese telecom gear giant ZTE.Analysts have said completing the $44 billion NXP transaction is Qualcomm's most pressing near-term issue. The deal was first announced in October 2016.San Diego-based Qualcomm also risked fallout from its status as a major supplier in China.Qualcomm shares initially rallied but pulled back fractionally as the chip giant likely will go ahead with its hefty NXP takeover.Other semiconductor firms with a big China presence include Intel (INTC), Texas Instruments (TXN), Nvidia (NVDA) and Micron (MU).Caterpillar has been investing heavily in China as it competes in the world's largest construction- and mining-equipment market.Last year the firm announced a five-year pact with China Energy Investment tied to mining-equipment sales and rentals in the future. It is also hoping to cash in on the country's ""Belt and Road"" initiative. The $1 trillion infrastructure spree builds on old Silk Road trading routes and spans Asia, Europe, the Middle East and Africa.Caterpillar stock rose 2.1% to 158.92, hitting its best levels intraday since late February.

20,QCOM,"U.S. shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) fell on Thursday — dragging the stock of its key customer, Dow component Apple (AAPL), down as well — after the chipmaker lowered its full-year revenue guidance on softer smartphone demand and uncertainty over the cryptocurrency mining market.Taiwan Semiconductor, also known as TSMC, dropped 5.7% to close at 39.53 on the stock market today. Shares of Apple also fell, losing 2.8% to close at 172.80.TSMC revised its full-year revenue target to the low end of its earlier forecast. It now expects 2018 revenue to grow 10%, compared with its prior forecast of 10% to 15% growth, Reuters reported.TSMC said it expects the global semiconductor industry to grow 5% this year, down from its earlier forecast of 5% to 7% growth. It sees revenue at contract chipmakers rising 8%, rather than 9% to 10% as previously forecast.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

Along with Apple, it makes chips for Nvidia (NVDA), Qualcomm (QCOM) and others.Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Mehdi Hosseini reiterated his neutral rating on TSMC and lowered his price target to 36 from 39.""We are lowering our estimates for TSM to account for a steeper-than-expected inventory digestion by premium smartphone customers, particularly Apple,"" Hosseini said in a note to clients.Apple is aggressively clearing out inventories of A11 processors in the June quarter as it prepares for new iPhone introductions using new A12 chips in the second half of the year, Hosseini said.TSMC's March-quarter results were lower than expected.

21,QCOM,"Dow futures rose solidly Thursday morning, along with S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures. But the stock market is under pressure on Trump trade war concerns. U.S.-China fireworks begin Friday. A pair of sectors at high risk from a Trump trade war have been big losers. That includes Dow Jones industrials such as Boeing (BA) and Caterpillar (CAT), as well as automakers. Chipmakers slumping, with Intel (INTC), Nvidia (NVDA) and Micron Technology (MU) stocks all failed breakouts. Apple (AAPL) stock also coming under pressure, with its heavy exposure to China.Dow futures rose 0.7% vs. fair value. S&P 500 futures climbed 0.6%. Nasdaq 100 futures were 0.6% higher.The Federal Reserve will release minutes from its June meeting at 2 p.m. ET. At that meeting, policymakers raised rates and signaled two more Fed rate hikes are likely this year, one more than previously expected. Investors will be looking to see how hawkish Fed members really are.Also Thursday: the ADP employment report will estimate June private-sector hiring, the Labor Department will release weekly jobless claims and ISM will issue its June nonmanufacturing index. Those all lead up to Labor's June employment report on Friday.But the big news Friday: President Trump is due to impose tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese goods, mostly tech and telecom products. China says it will immediately retaliate, dollar for dollar.In Tuesday's half-day session before the 4th of July holiday, the major stock market averages opened higher but reversed lower. Nasdaq composite fell 0.9%, but closed above its 50-day moving average. The S&P 500 index slid 0.5%, once again sinking below its 50-day line. The Dow Jones industrial average retreated 0.55% after rising intraday above its 200-day line.Micron stock triggered Tuesday's sell-off. A Chinese court barred Micron Technology from selling chips in the country, siding with Taiwan chipmaker United Microelectronics (UMC) in a patent fight. Rightly or wrong, investors took that Micron ruling as part of the U.S.-China trade war. China has been holding up approval of the Qualcomm (QCOM)-NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) deal until the U.S. lifts harsh sanctions on China telecom gear giant ZTE.In any case, Micron stock fell 5.5% Tuesday. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index retreated 1.8%, moving back below its 200-day line. Micron was indicated lower again Thursday.Chip stocks have been conspicuous laggards even as the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite hit new highs in June. Even Intel stock, Nvidia stock and Micron stock, which were outperforming the chip sector, have fallen well below buy points and their 50-day moving averages.U.S.-China trade war tariffs won't target semiconductors much at first. But the U.S. is wary of China of buying cutting-edge tech as Beijing seeks dominance via Made in China 2025. Beijing could continue to make life difficult for U.S. chipmakers working in China via regulatory hurdles. Longer term, the trend is toward a U.S.-China cold trade war in technology that would roil complex supply chains and cut off markets.China is a huge and growing market for Boeing jets. China could favor Airbus (EADSY) over Boeing in a trade war. Boeing was the top Dow Jones stock in 2017. Boeing stock recently triggered a sell signal and is trading below its buy point.Another Dow Jones component, Caterpillar stock, has fallen below its 50-day and 200-day lines.General Motors (GM) and Ford (F) reported solid U.S. sales Tuesday. But GM stock, Ford stock and their global peers are struggling as Trump threatens a global auto import tariff. That would trigger retaliation and raise supply chain costs as even U.S.-made cars and trucks tend to have high non-U.S. content.Apple, another Dow Jones stock, is also vulnerable to a prolonged U.S.-China trade war. China is a big market for the Apple iPhone and various services. Most Apple iPhones are made in China. A trade war could hit iPhone suppliers, China could hold up exports and threaten any number of actions to hinder Apple.Apple stock blasted out of a buy zone in a sharp rally from the end of April to early May. Strong earnings helped, fueled by fast-growing high-margin services as iPhone sales were so-so A huge buyback and Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) buying more Apple stock also were big Apple stock drivers.But in recent weeks, Apple stock has been fading. It's now just modestly above a buy point. Shares are fighting for support at 50-day, closing just below that level Tuesday.So far stocks have largely retreated on trade war fears, even as hopes remain that the actual damage will be minimal. But on Friday, President Trump is open hostilities with tariffs on an initial $34 billion of Chinese goods. China has vowed to retaliate. Tariffs are slated to hit a further $16 billion in Chinese products soon.Trump has threatened tariffs on another $200 billion in Chinese goods, and then a further $200 billion.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:The Big Picture: Stocks Face This TestTrump China Tariff Decision Will Be Yuuuge For StocksThese 4 Top Stocks Have One Thing In Common  IBD Stock Of The Day Tests Buy Point After 19% Run

22,QCOM,"Chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO) on Wednesday lowered its offering price for Qualcomm (QCOM) in response to Qualcomm's increased bid for NXP Semiconductors (NXPI).X Broadcom said Qualcomm's revised offer for NXP amounted to a transfer of value to NXP shareholders.""Broadcom today reaffirms its commitment to acquiring Qualcomm, and is adjusting its offer following the Qualcomm board's decision to transfer $4.10 per Qualcomm share (or $6.2 billion of value) from Qualcomm stockholders to NXP stockholders,"" Broadcom said in a news release.Broadcom is now offering $79 a share for Qualcomm, consisting of $57 in cash and $22 in Broadcom shares. If Qualcomm does not go through with its NXP acquisition, Broadcom will increase its offer by $3 in cash per share to the previous purchase price of $82 a share, consisting of $60 in cash and $22 in Broadcom shares.Broadcom shares slipped 0.4% to close at 248.62 on the stock market today. Qualcomm lost 0.9% to 63.40, and NXP ticked up 4 cents to 125.60.On Tuesday, San Diego-based Qualcomm increased its offer for NXP to $127.50 per share from $110 per share. The latest offer values NXP at $44 billion.Broadcom originally offered to buy Qualcomm on Nov. 6 for $70 a share in cash and stock.

23,QCOM,"Wireless chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM) on Tuesday raised its bid to buy NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) by 16% in a move that could derail Broadcom's (AVGO) proposed takeover of Qualcomm.X San Diego-based Qualcomm increased its offer for NXP to $127.50 per share and said it now has the backing of a shareholder group led by Elliott Management that opposed the previous proposal. The latest offer values NXP at $44 billion and is designed to help Qualcomm expand its footprint into key growth markets, including automotive, Internet of Things, security and networking. Qualcomm currently gets the lion's share of its business from the mobile phone market.Qualcomm's sweetened offer for NXP also strengthens its defenses against a hostile takeover by Broadcom. Broadcom's current offer of $82 a share in cash and stock for Qualcomm is contingent on Qualcomm either terminating its offer for NXP or completing the deal at the earlier bid of $110 a share. Broadcom's proposed purchase of Qualcomm is valued at $121 billion.IBD'S TAKE: For the latest news on chip stocks, visit IBD's news page Chip Stocks To Watch And Semiconductor Industry News.""Qualcomm's leading (system-on-chip) capabilities and technology roadmap, coupled with NXP's differentiated position in automotive, security and IoT offers a compelling value proposition,"" Qualcomm Chief Executive Steve Mollenkopf said in a news release. ""With only one regulatory approval remaining, we are working hard to complete this transaction expeditiously.""Broadcom said Tuesday that it is evaluating its options following Qualcomm's revised offer for NXP. It encouraged Qualcomm shareholders to vote for Broadcom's six nominees to Qualcomm's board of directors to express their disappointment with Qualcomm's management.

The transaction must still obtain clearance from the Ministry of Commerce in China.

24,QCOM,"The China trade war is officially underway, and President Donald Trump already is looking ahead to escalating the conflict. Just after midnight on Friday, Trump tariffs of 25% on $34 billion worth of Chinese high-tech-related imports took effect. Beijing vowed to fire back immediately, aiming at U.S. autos and agriculture. But stock futures took the actual start of hostilities in stride.American-built vehicles from the likes of Ford (F), Tesla (TSLA) and even Daimler (DDAIF), which builds Mercedes-Benz SUVs in Alabama, will face an additional 25% tax. China also is targeting soybeans and other agricultural imports.The Trump administration has already drawn up the next phases of the war and it could get ugly. But President Trump and President Xi Jinping may still have one last chance to call a cease-fire, either later this month or in August.Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on Thursday after the stock market had closed, Trump confirmed Friday's China tariffs, and tallied up what's on the trade war launching pad: ""34, and then you have another 16 in two weeks and then as you know we have 200 billion in abeyance and then after the 200 billion we have 300 billion in abeyance. Ok? So we have 50 plus 200 plus almost 300.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseStock market futures' reaction was muted. Dow futures, which initially traded modestly higher, fell 0.2% vs. fair value. S&P 500 futures lost 0.1%. Nasdaq 100 futures fell a fraction. In Thursday's stock market trading, the Nasdaq composite rose 1.1%, the S&P 500 index 0.9% and the Dow Jones 0.75%. But the stock market rally has come under pressure as Trump trade war fears have intensified.The U.S. only imported $506 billion in Chinese goods last year, but you get the point: Trump is clearly threatening a full-scale China trade war. Beijing, meanwhile, vows to meet the U.S, blow for blow. While Chinese targets are somewhat limited by its $130 billion in American imports, Beijing has other ways to retaliate, and that's one of Wall Street's big fears.Beyond tariffs, U.S. multinationals could face other significant hurdles in China. Beijing could make life difficult for Dow Jones stocks Boeing (BA), Caterpillar (CAT) and Apple (AAPL). China has been holding up the Qualcomm (QCOM) takeover of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI). Some analysts also think the Trump tariffs may have played a role in last week's patent infringement Chinese court ruling against Micron Technology (MU).Now that Trump and Xi are beyond the brink of a trade war, the big question is what, if anything, can bring them back.There's one clear answer. Trump has already bent over backwards to save Chinese telecom equipment giant ZTE and its 70,000 jobs. But the rescue job isn't quite over. The Commerce Department still have to give a green light to U.S. component suppliers to resume sales to ZTE. In addition, Congress must reject a Senate amendment to a must-pass defense funding bill that would keep a ban on sales to ZTE. Both of those developments should fall into place by August.Beijing refuses to negotiate under duress. That's why there is a real risk the China trade war will escalate with more rounds of Trump tariffs. But the ZTE reprieve may give Xi an occasion to resume negotiations despite the live fire. After all, those talks only made progress after Trump intervened, pledging to get ZTE back in business quickly.For a brief moment, Trump touted a deal that would have China buy more from American farmers, instead of cutting purchases of soybeans, cotton and other crops. We'll know later this summer if there's still such a deal to be had.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:As Trump Tariffs Hit, The U.S. Is Losing The China Trade War — Big TimeThe Big Picture: Stocks Rally On Eve Of U.S.-China Trade War6 Stocks To Watch As Trade Tariffs Near DeadlineThese 5 Top Stocks Are Near Buy Points From This Bullish Base

26,QCOM,"Stocks dug into substantial early losses early Tuesday, as an intensifying U.S.-China trade spat triggered a deep sell-off across Asian stock markets. China trade-sensitive stocks, including Boeing (BA) and NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), posted heavy declines on the Dow and the Nasdaq 100.A broad range of China stocks spearheaded the early losses. JD.com (JD), Ctrip.com International (CTRP), Baidu (BIDU), Huya (HUYA) and JinkoSolar (JKS) were among the deepest decliners.The Dow Jones industrial avereage came off opening lows, but was down 1.2% shortly after the start of trade. Boeing and Caterpillar (CAT) led the downside. More than half of the Dow's 30 issues fell more than 1%.The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite each shed 0.7%. About a dozen S&P 500 names sold down more than 2%. China trade sensitive names CF Industries (CF), Freeport McMoRan (FCX) and General Motors (GM) fell furthest.China names were among the Nasdaq's worst decliners. JD.com, NetEase and Baidu had three of the Nasdaq 100's four worst losses.Netherlands-based NXP Semiconductors continued to ping-pong on U.S.-China news, as the Senate passed a bill Monday that would reinstate stiff penalties vs. China telecom giant ZTE Corp. Qualcomm (QCOM) has been attempting to acquire the NXP in a $43 billion deal which China's regulators reportedly approved last week. But the approval had been hitched to President Trump's forgiving ZTE for its violations of trade sanctions vs. North Korea. On Tuesday, NXP dropped 1.8% to one of the Nasdaq 100's deepest early losses. Qualcomm was down 1.6%.The Dow has five straight declines under its belt, falling back below the 25,000 level on Monday. The index appears headed for a break of its 50-day line at Tuesday's open, although premarket action does not always follow through into regular trade.  The S&P 500 ended Monday 3% above its 50-day line. The Nasdaq remains just a fraction off Thursday's high, and 5% above its 50-day level.With 25% tariffs on $50 billion on imports from China set to kick in on July 6, China has said it would impose equal penalties on U.S. imports. If those tariffs go into place, President Trump on Monday said he would increase the scope of U.S. tariffs to $200 billion worth of China goods.As a result, Asian stock markets careened lower Tuesday. The yuan dropped to a five-month low against the dollar and investors scrambled to get out of the way of the worsening trade dispute. The Shanghai Composite swooned 3.8%, the Shenzhen Composite dived 5.3% as more than 1,000 stocks hit their daily 10% loss maximum circuit breaker. The selling quickly infected Japan's market, where Tokyo's Nikkei 225 plummeted 1.8%, cutting below its 50-day moving average.Asia's rout moderated somewhat in Europe, where markets traded sharply lower in afternoon trade. Frankfurt's DAX fell hardest, down 1.3%. The CAC-40 in Paris was 1.2% in the red, while London's FTSE 100 dimmed 0.5%.Sellers went after a number of China-based stocks in early U.S. trade. JinkoSolar dropped more than 4%. JD.com, Ctrip and Weibo (WB) all showed losses deeper than 3%.  Among the scorching-hot trio of China IPOs: Huya, iQiyi (IQ) and Bilibili (BILI), gtwo reversed premarket losses and punched higher: Huya gained a fraction. IQiyi scored a 3% gain. All three stocks are due for price consolidation, and pullbacks could present investors with buy opportunities.Another China-based IPO, Sogou (SOGO), broke out on Friday, then retook its cup-base buy point Monday in a huge-volume gain. Shares dropped 3.8% before Tuesday's open, holding just above the base's 14.80 buy point.China names also led the early declines among IBD 50 stocks. China Lodging (HTHT) dropped 3.6%. YY (YY) fell 1.9%. Momo (MOMO) dumped 3.7%. The declines did not do significant damage to the charts of either China Lodging or Momo.The loss dealt a setback to YY, which has been struggling to build the right side of a three-month base pattern.On the Dow, Boeing unraveled 3.2%, cutting below support at its 10-week moving average in heavy trade. The stock is trading below a 365.10 buy point in a cup-with-handle base. A fall below 335.89 would trigger the automatic sell rule.Verizon (VZ) scored one of the Dow's lonely early gains, rising 1%. Deutsche Bank upgraded the stock to buy, from hold. Verizon has been attempting to start up the right side of a four-month base pattern.China-based Autohome (ATHM) notched the deepest early loss among IBD Leaderboard names. Autohome dived 3.9% at Tuesday's open. The stock is extended after clearing an ascending-base buy point at 107.64 on May 30.In economic news, U.S. housing starts jumped more than expected in May.

Micron Technology reports earnings on Wednesday.Micron stock also is the highest rated, with a 98 Composite Rating. Entegris has a 94 Composite Rating, Texas Instruments a 92 CR and ASML a 90 CR.

All the major averages fell modestly Friday as the U.S. and China announced tariffs on each other, with the risk of further escalation.Micron Technology is in a cup base with a high handle buy point of 64.76. Shares soared in May, with the memory chip specialist announcing strong earnings guidance early on May 21 and then a big buyback after the close that day.

The stock hit resistance around this area a couple of times earlier this year.Broadcom stock has been consolidating since late November. Shares came under pressure as the chipmaker made a big bid for fellow wireless chipmaker Qualcomm. Even after President Trump blocked a Broadcom-Qualcomm deal on national security grounds, the stock continued to struggle as Broadcom warned of weak smartphone demand. That was seen as a sign of weak Apple (AAPL) iPhone X demand.ASML stock topped a 216.10 flat-base buy point on Thursday, but with a modest 1% gain and volume that was 10% below normal.

30,QCOM,"Chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO) on Monday questioned the sincerity of Qualcomm's (QCOM) offer to negotiate a takeover proposal, saying Qualcomm might be seeking to delay its March 6 annual shareholder meeting.X After Qualcomm rejected Broadcom's overtures, Broadcom decided to pursue a hostile takeover through a proxy fight. It has nominated six people to represent its interests on Qualcomm's board of directors. Shareholders will elect Qualcomm's new 11-member board at the annual meeting.Qualcomm on Monday said it has requested another meeting with Broadcom to discuss the price and terms of a possible transaction.

33,QCOM,"Broadcom (AVGO) is on course to win all six of the seats it's seeking on Qualcomm's (QCOM) board, giving it a majority slate at the chipmaker based on a count of more than half of the votes already cast, according to information obtained by Bloomberg.If that result holds up when the final shareholder vote takes place, Broadcom would have a mandate to negotiate its $117 billion hostile bid for its rival, overturning Qualcomm management's opposition to doing a deal. Qualcomm's shareholder meeting, scheduled for Tuesday, was postponed Monday for at least 30 days after a U.S. government agency said it wants to look at the proposed transaction on security concerns.Representatives for Broadcom and Qualcomm declined to comment. Shares of both companies were largely inactive in after-hours trading Monday.

39,QCOM,"If Broadcom (AVGO) fails in its quest to buy Qualcomm (QCOM), the acquisitive chipmaker is likely to look for other targets as the semiconductor industry consolidates.X In a report Thursday, RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani pointed to several chip companies that Broadcom could pursue if it is jilted by Qualcomm shareholders in a proxy vote on March 6.""Fundamentally, (Broadcom is) in a unique position given (its) ability to generate about $9 billion to $10 billion of free cash flow annually, a balance sheet that is almost net debt neutral and a management team that has an impeccable history in integrating assets,"" Daryanani said.He reiterated his ""top pick"" buy rating on Broadcom with a price target of 325.Broadcom shares were up 0.7% to close at 249.35 on the stock market today.Broadcom has a well-established playbook when it comes to making value-enhancing mergers and acquisitions, Daryanani said. It looks for chipmakers in markets with only two or three competitors and targets those with leading market-share positions. It likes companies with a stable growth outlook, entrenched customers and room for profit-margin accretion.Given those criteria, Broadcom's options are rather limited, Daryanani said. Still, he highlighted five chip companies that might be in play if the Qualcomm takeover fails.They include Analog Devices (ADI), Marvell Technology (MRVL), Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM), Microsemi (MSCC) and Xilinx (XLNX).Get IBD's Market Prep And Tech Report Newsletters — For Free!Xilinx satisfies most of Broadcom's requirements, though its valuation might be too high, based on Broadcom's acquisition history, Daryanani said.Microsemi has potential for operating expense reduction and margin improvement.

Microsemi currently trades near 61.Marvell would be a nice fit for Broadcom, but regulatory hurdles make the deal improbable, he said.Analog Devices and Maxim in theory could have room for operating profit margin expansion, but that might be difficult given their diversified customer bases, he said.RELATED:Broadcom Trims Its Offer For Qualcomm After NXP Deal

49,QCOM,"Semiconductor industry executives are confident the chip business will continue to see healthy growth in 2018, though not at last year's blistering pace, according to one advisory firm's survey.Lincoln Clark, head of the semiconductor practice at KPMG, said the survey results show ""tempered optimism"" for the industry this year.""It's unlikely we'll see a repeat of 2017's growth rate for global semiconductor revenue, but 2018 should be another successful year in its own right as more than one-quarter of the respondents expect their revenue to grow at least 6%,"" Clark said in a news release Tuesday.The survey also found that semiconductor leaders are more optimistic than they were last year when asked for their outlook on profitability, revenue growth, capital spending, research and development spending, and workforce growth, KPMG said.Growth drivers this year are expected to include cloud computing, artificial intelligence and Internet of Things, or IoT, the firm said.""Though the No. 1 revenue driver remains wireless applications, its importance fell slightly in 2018 though we do anticipate growth as 5G begins to roll out in future periods,"" Clark said.Of the 150 semiconductor industry leaders surveyed, 75% said wireless communications would be an important revenue driver this year.

52,QCOM,"Chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO) is likely to pursue other acquisitions now that President Donald Trump has nixed its proposed purchase of Qualcomm (QCOM), analysts say.X Trump late Monday issued an order blocking Broadcom's hostile takeover bid for San Diego-based Qualcomm on national security grounds. Even though Singapore-based Broadcom is moving its headquarters to the U.S., the federal government is still concerned about the company's ties to China, including firms like Huawei.Another worry is that the U.S. would lose its leadership position in 5G wireless technology if Qualcomm is acquired. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States had cited concerns about Broadcom's penchant for slashing research and development spending following acquisitions.It isn't the first time that Trump has blocked a chip industry deal on national security grounds related to China. Last September, he blocked the sale of Hillsboro, Ore.-based Lattice Semiconductor (LSCC) to Canyon Bridge Capital Partners, which has ties to a fund owned by the Chinese government.Broadcom is likely to remain acquisitive, but will pursue smaller chip firms, Wall Street analysts said Tuesday. Its offer for Qualcomm was valued at $117 billion.Several analysts on Tuesday cited Xilinx (XLNX) as the next possible acquisition target for Broadcom.""Xilinx satisfies most of Broadcom's requirements and is in a stable duopoly, though valuation could be high given Broadcom's historical discipline,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani said in a report. Xilinx has a market value of nearly $20 billion.Broadcom's acquisition prospects likely start with Xilinx, ""which appears well-aligned,"" B. Riley FBR analyst Craig Ellis said in a report.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAnother possibility is Mellanox Technologies (MLNX), Ellis and other analysts said Tuesday.If Broadcom decides to step back from acquisitions, it could please investors by increasing its capital returns through dividends and share buybacks, Ellis said.With the takeover threat gone, Qualcomm now has to focus on getting its house in order, BMO Capital Markets analyst Tim Long said in a report.It faces headwinds in its core wireless chip business and a major legal conflict with customer Apple (AAPL), Long said. Plus, Qualcomm still hasn't closed its purchase of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), which needs to get approval from regulators in China.Qualcomm stock ""could tread water in the $60 range"" until the company can show that it is on the right track, GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives said in a report.Qualcomm shares fell 5% to close at 59.70 on the stock market today. Broadcom stock dipped 0.6% to 261.22.Meanwhile, possible Broadcom acquisition target Xilinx lost 1.2% to 76.14. Mellanox dropped 1.4% to 71.95.A wild card in the chip consolidation trend is Intel (INTC). Last week, the Wall Street Journal reported that Intel is interested in making acquisitions to shore up its competition positioning. The Journal said Intel could even make a play for Broadcom.However, an Intel-Broadcom combination appears unlikely, especially after Trump's executive order, Ellis said.""The president's action not only banned the (Broadcom-Qualcomm) deal, but restricted 'any substantially equivalent merger, acquisition, or takeover,'"" Ellis said. ""That writing could potentially preclude an Intel and Broadcom combination. Even before that, we believe deal size (Intel $244 billion market cap and Broadcom $104 billion), international regulatory approval, and customer supplier concentration fears and thus pushback are sufficient to keep us skeptical.""RELATED:Trump Issues Order Blocking Broadcom Takeover Of Qualcomm

The Dow has been meeting resistance at the 50-day moving average this week.The Russell 2000 shed 0.2%. Volume was modestly lower on the NYSE and higher on the Nasdaq compared with the same time on Monday.Trump late Monday issued an order barring the proposed Broadcom takeover of Qualcomm due to national security concerns. Broadcom shares pared gains but were up 1.5% at midday, while Qualcomm fell more than 4% to the lowest level since Nov. 3. Qualcomm shares are also close to testing the 200-day moving average. Shares got choppy after taking out the medium-term 50-day line on Feb. 5.On Tuesday, Trump fired Tillerson as secretary of state, and named CIA Director Mike Pompeo to replace him. Trump announced the changes on Twitter. There was no official announcement on the White House's website.In economic news, core consumer prices, which exclude food and energy, rose 0.2% in February.

The Nasdaq Composite gained 0.5%, despite Qualcomm's (QCOM) 5% decline at the open. The S&P 500 jumped 0.4%.Overseas action was mild on Tuesday, though in the U.S., politics was all over the premarket session. Qualcomm dived after President Trump late Monday ordered the attempted hostile takeover of the chipmaker by Singapore-based Broadcom (AVGO) blocked due to national security concerns.

56,QCOM,"Broadcom (AVGO) on Monday raised its bid to buy wireless-chip maker Qualcomm (QCOM) by 17% to $82 a share, calling the deal its ""best and final offer.""X Under the terms of the deal, Broadcom would pay $60 a share in cash and the remainder in Broadcom shares. Its original offer on Nov. 6 was worth $70 a share, with $60 a share in cash and the rest in Broadcom stock. The deal has a total value of over $121 billion and would be the largest-ever technology deal.""Our proposal includes substantially more Broadcom stock, which will allow Qualcomm stockholders a greater opportunity to participate in the upside created by the combined company's strategic and operational advantages,"" Broadcom Chief Executive Hock Tan said in a letter to Qualcomm's board of directors. ""Broadcom's track record demonstrates our ability to consistently accelerate share price appreciation following acquisitions and indicates a substantial likelihood that we will exceed our synergies expectations.""Broadcom also said it is prepared to pay a significant termination fee if the deal cannot obtain the required government regulatory approvals.One condition of the deal is that Qualcomm can't delay its annual shareholders meeting past March 6.IBD'S TAKE: Broadcom has an IBD Composite Rating of 76 out of a best-possible 99. It ranks No. 12 on IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Fabless industry group. To see which stocks lead the group, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.Broadcom said its offer also is premised on Qualcomm either completing its pending acquisition of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) at the current terms of $110 per NXP share or the transaction being terminated.""This proposal to acquire Qualcomm is extremely compelling compared to any other alternative available to Qualcomm, with or without the acquisition of NXP, and we believe any responsible board would engage with us, without further delay, to turn this proposal into an executed definitive agreement,"" Tan told the Qualcomm board.Qualcomm to date has refused to negotiate with Broadcom after saying its initial offer substantially undervalued Qualcomm.""While the price is higher, the 'best and final' nature of the deal may be viewed as increasing the chance Broadcom could walk,"" Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said in a report Monday. ""We suspect the price is still below what Qualcomm is looking for.""Raymond James analyst Chris Caso said Broadcom has other options for mergers and acquisitions if the deal doesn't happen, ""though none would be as significant as the Qualcomm deal.""Cowen analyst Karl Ackerman said Broadcom's latest maneuver makes it ""abundantly clear"" that it doesn't want to own NXP.""What we think should not be overlooked is the notion that an acquisition of NXP by Qualcomm is a form of 'poison pill' to thwart a possible takeover by Broadcom,"" Ackerman said in a report Monday.Broadcom stock fell 3.1% to 228.10 on the stock market today, amid a broad market sell-off. Qualcomm tumbled 6.6% to 61.73.

The Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 each rose 0.2%, as Apple (AAPL) dipped a fraction and three of the four FANG stocks managed early gains. Adobe led the Nasdaq 100 in early action, with Ulta Beauty (ULTA) and Micron Technologies (MU) close behind. Broadcom fell to the bottom of the list.Early economic news disappointed, with housing starts slowing sharply in February to an annualized rate of 1.236 million, according to the Commerce Department.

Economist consensus had projected a 1.322 million rate.Industrial production jumped 1.1% in February, according to the Federal Reserve, a big improvement over January's 0.3% contraction and far above forecasts for a 0.4% increase.

Privacy Policy & Terms of Use The Dow enters Friday's session down 1.8% for the week, with its attempts to advance still petering out at its 50-day moving average.

The Nasdaq is down 1.1% and back below the 7,500 mark, but not by much. IBD's Big Picture feature on Thursday provided 5 critical elements to help monitor the health of the currently choppy market.More than half of the Dow's 30 stocks moved higher at the starting bell. Chipmaker Intel (INTC) led with a 0.9% gain.Adobe Systems powered up 4% after reporting late Thursday its fiscal first-quarter earnings rose 65% on a 24% rise in revenue. Both numbers were well above consensus targets. Second-quarter guidance was mixed, with earnings above, revenue below expectations. Friday's early move put the IBD 50 stock more than 20% above a 186.37 buy point after an early January breakout, placing it in a profit-taking zone.Chipmaking giant Broadcom swung less than 2% lower following fiscal first-quarter results delivered late Thursday. Revenue and earnings topped analyst targets during the quarter, but second-quarter guidance just met views and the company reported a fall in wireless chip sales. The premarket move does not suggest any real chart damage, as the stock hovers below a 274.36 buy point in a four-month double-bottom base.Other chip stocks also showed mixed premarket action. Ambarella traded flat after trimming an early 6% surge. Qualcomm pared a 4% gain to less than 1%. Ambarella is climbing the right side of a cup base pattern, but its relative strength line — which you would like to see moving alongside or even slightly ahead of the stock's climb — continues to lag.Micron Technologies held its 2% advance in premarket trade. The stock is extended from a March 5 breakout, and moving quickly toward the 20% gain level that marks a profit-taking zone.Retailer Buckle (BKE) and electronics maker Jabil Circuits (JBL) spiked 8% and 6%, respectively, after reporting quarterly results. On the early injured list, Overstock (OSTK) dived 14% after its fourth-quarter revenue stopped well short of expectations. Perry Ellis (PERY) and Tiffany & Co.

60,QCOM,"LAS VEGAS – While finished products get most of the attention at the annual CES consumer electronics show, ""ingredient technologies"" are the unsung heroes, setting the stage for exciting new devices and services in the years ahead.X Two of those ""ingredient technologies"" being touted at CES 2018 are 5G wireless and artificial intelligence, officials say.""5G and AI are heralds for the coming data age,"" said Steve Koenig, senior director of research for the Consumer Technology Association, owner and sponsor of CES, which opened Tuesday and runs through Friday. ""CES is going to set the pace for that.""5G boasts fiber-like data speeds, low latency and the ability to support unlimited data plans. It will fuel new services and technologies such as the Internet of Things, augmented reality, autonomous vehicles and smart cities.With today's 4G wireless networks, consumers can download a two-hour movie in 6 minutes. With 5G that will take 3.6 seconds, Koenig said, going at speeds of 10 gigabits per second vs. 100 megabits per second with 4G.Wireless operators such as AT&T (T), Verizon (VZ) and China Mobile (CHL) are beginning to deploy 5G networks. Wireless-communications chip maker Qualcomm (QCOM) is using CES to boast about its 5G expertise. Qualcomm shares were up fractionally Thursday to 65.43.Qualcomm is well positioned to continue its dominance in wireless chips because of the increasing complexity of mobile radio frequency chips and its ability to support numerous RF bands in devices, Qualcomm President Cristiano Amon said at a media briefing Monday. 5G will see an order of magnitude increase in combinations of wireless frequency bands vs. the current 4G standard, he said.""5G is a great, exciting opportunity because it is going to be a reality sooner than everybody thought,"" Amon said. ""We are going to get 5G into a smartphone as early as 2019.""At CES, Qualcomm announced a series of RF front-end chip design wins with Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google, HTC, LG, Samsung and Sony (SNE) for new flagship smartphones.Artificial intelligence is another ingredient technology showing up in more products at CES 2018. Devices infused with AI have the ability to anticipate a person's needs based on their past behavior and preferences.Consumer electronics vendors Samsung and LG Electronics announced plans at CES to add intelligence to all of their devices, from TVs to household appliances.Nvidia (NVDA) is promoting its graphics processing units for AI computing at CES. Speaking at a press event Sunday, Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang said the technology is going to ""revolutionize"" many industries. Already AI is enabling software to write software and is playing a critical role in self-driving cars, image and speech recognition and other areas, Huang said.

Two of the three major indexes cleared key levels of resistance, and the Nasdaq shook off a distribution day. Monday's action will provide a test of how durable those gains — and the market's upgraded status — might be.Merck advanced 1.2% to lead the Dow in opening trade. The New Jersey-based drugmaker last week announced it would invest up to $5.8 billion to jointly develop, with Japan's Eisai, the Lenvima-Ketruda combination cancer treatment which, in January, earned the Food and Drug Administration's 'breakthrough' designation as a kidney cancer treatment.Intel posted one of the Dow's few early losses, down 2.6% after reports on Friday that the company was considering a takeover bid for Broadcom, as a means to upend Broadcom's effort to merge with Qualcomm.  Broadcom opened more than 3% higher.

Amgen and other competitors to Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' (REGN) cholesterol drug Praleunt fell after Regeneron announced plans to lower prices for the drug. Regeneron shares rose 0.2% at the open.Initial public offerings also played a part in early action, as China-based Qudian (QD) popped 6% on stronger-than-forecast results for the fourth quarter, including a 53% surge in its number of borrowers, to 6.9 million, and a 70% increase in its total transactions, to $3.9 billion, during the period.

But after losses Tuesday, most were pointed higher slightly higher Wednesday morning.Trump is looking to slap tariffs on $60 billion worth of Chinese imports, focusing on tech and telecom products, Reuters reported late Tuesday, while CNBC said the actions could include investment curbs and even visa restrictions.

65,QCOM,"After a strong rebound since March 2, the stock market took a rest on Tuesday. The major indexes took losses of 0.6% to 1% in heavier turnover vs. Monday. Several top-rated stocks, meanwhile, continue to hold above or close to recent buy points.While Broadcom (AVGO) is receiving tons of media attention on news that President Trump ordered to block a potential megamerger with Qualcomm (QCOM), industry-mate Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR) has quietly broken out of a 15-week double-bottom base that features a 124.54 buy point.In a good double bottom, the second sell-off must undercut the first initial decline. Monolithic certainly did that: The base's second low of 103.14 went below the first low of 105.01.The stock found solid support at the 200-day moving average, and the base features symmetry. A third positive trait: The overall decline in the base is a mild 18.7% from head to toe.Monolithic, an expert in mixed-signal circuits including DC converters, LED drivers and audio amplifiers, holds a 97 Composite Rating as seen in IBD Stock Checkup in IBD's fabless semiconductors industry group. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters see earnings rising 33% to 77 cents a share in the first quarter of 2018.Halozyme Therapeutics (HALO) is trying to clear a cup base that shows a 21.23 entry. This base is unique, particularly on a daily chart. For starters, the nine-week pattern has elements of a double bottom. Yet the stock has a volatile streak, so the jagged price action can generally be treated as a cup.Second, as seen only on a daily chart, it formed a tight handle, starting with a down day on Feb. 28. That produced a 20.42 entry, a dime above the handle's intraday high. Volume on the breakout from that early buy point was light.San Diego-based Halozyme specializes in recombinant human enzymes for the drug delivery, encrinology and oncology fields of medicine. It turned profitable in recent quarters. The small-cap firm posted earnings of 2 cents and 85 cents a share in Q3 and Q4 last year, respectively.The Dow Jones transportation average outperformed on Tuesday, rising 0.5%. Airlines gave the sector index a nice push up. Ryanair (RYAAY) is building a cup base that appears to have made two handles. The most recent handle has a 125.32 entry.The Irish discount carrier is one of the highest-rated companies in IBD's airline group, which has moved from 88th to 34th over the past six weeks in terms of six-month performance. Ryanair, a large cap with a $29 billion market value, has posted four straight quarters of profit growth, averaging 28% per quarter. Q1 profit is seen climbing 27% to 28 cents a share.Meanwhile, real estate data provider Zillow (Z), highlighted in this column on March 5, has now rallied 17% past a breakout from a solid cup with handle and a 48.59 buy point.

Facebook rivals Snap (SNAP) and Twitter (TWTR) had stellar results, while Nvidia delivered blowout earnings and bullish guidance. The 10-year Treasury yield hit a four-year high of 2.88%, unnerving stock markets, though it backed off.Graphics-chip maker Nvidia (NVDA) earnings swelled 80% to $1.78 a share, on sales of $2.91 billion, up 34%, in the quarter ended Jan. 28. Analysts expected $1.16 and $2.67 billion. For the current Q1, Nvidia expects revenue of $2.9 billion, up 33%. Wall Street was looking for $2.44 billion. Shares soared 6.4% Friday. Meanwhile, Broadcom (AVGO) raised its bid to buy wireless-chip maker Qualcomm (QCOM) by 17% to $82 a share, say that is its ""best and final offer.""

68,QCOM,"A steepening stock market sell-off made for a tough first day of work for Jerome Powell, officially sworn in as the chairman of the Federal Reserve on Monday, as markets sliced lower in a continuation of Friday's heavy distribution.X The Dow Jones industrial average faltered 4.6%, down almost 1,200 points for its largest-ever point loss, with all but three of its stocks posting losses greater than 2%.The S&P 500 unraveled 4.1%, with Wells Fargo (WFC) posting the index's worst decline,  down almost 10%,  as investors reacted to penalties imposed by the Federal Reserve on Friday. The sanctions, imposed on Janet Yellen's final day as head of the Fed, stirred concerns that regulators, under Powell, could be set for a more authoritarian turn.The Nasdaq composite dropped 3.8%, with Apple (AAPL) carving 2.5% lower and, among the FANG tech leaders, Alphabet (GOOGL) and Netflix (NFLX) down about 5%.A couple of brief intraday market rebound attempts quickly collapsed, although bonds took back some ground, driving the 10-year yield to 2.79% from 2.84% as both the dollar and commodities traded mixed.Big Oil names were again key contributors to the day's declines, as U.S. benchmark crude dropped more than 2%, to just below $64 a barrel.  Exxon-Mobil (XOM) and  Chevron (CVX) led the downside on the Dow, each skidding more than 5%. Total (TOT) and BP (BP) fell sharply.Among other Dow components, Boeing (BA) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) dived 6% and 5%. United Technologies' (UTX) decline reached 5.5% as the stock fell below the 50-day line.Shipping was the session's strongest industry, buoyed by a 3% gap up from Kirby (KEX).

Kirby shares are extended after a breakout from a cup-with-handle base in January.China-based stocks took some bruises, led by Sina's (SINA) 4% fall. The firm-volume decline droves shares to a test of their 10-week moving average. Sina is less than 4% below a 113.05 buy point in a double-bottom base — avoiding an automatic sell rule.Chips traded broadly lower, despite the ostensibly positive news that Broadcom (AVGO) had ratcheted up its bid to acquire Qualcomm (QCOM) to more than $121 billion.

69,QCOM,"Futures for the S&P 500 index, Nasdaq 100 and Dow Jones industrial average were well off their overnight lows but still pointed to sizable losses at Tuesday's open on the heels of the worst losses in years for the major averages.X The Dow Jones industrial average fell 1,175 points during Monday's stock market trading, its worst point loss ever. The more-relevant percentage loss of 4.6% was not historic, but still the worst since August 2011. The S&P 500 index tumbled 4.1%, also its worst drop in six years, while the Nasdaq composite fell 3.8%. All three indexes drove below their 50-day moving averages.Investors should be extremely cautious about making any buys in the current market environment. If you haven't already, you should consider taking at least partial profits of winners and be quick to cut losses.S&P 500 index futures sank 2% vs. fair value in while Dow futures plunged 2.4%, though both had pointed to 4%+ losses at one point overnight. Nasdaq 100 futures fell 1.5%. Futures were volatile, with big swings.The market's so-called fear gauge, the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), or VIX, rose sharply early Tuesday after skyrocketing Monday.IBD'S TAKE: Don't try to guess where the market is headed next.

European indexes were down sharply intraday.Keep in mind that overnight trading, for individual stocks or major indexes, does not always translate into how they will act at the market open and close the following day.Meanwhile, Micron Technology (MU) moved on earnings, while a pair of Apple (AAPL) chipmakers — Cirrus Logic (CRUS) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) — diverged following their quarterly results.The memory-chip giant earned $2.45 a share, up 666% vs. a year earlier and beating views for $2.22, according to Zacks Investment Research. Revenue swelled 71% to $6.803 billion vs. views for $6.387 billion. Micron is benefiting from strong demand and pricing for memory.Micron shares rose 1.2% in premarket trading Tuesday. That follows a 3.5% loss to 39.40 Monday to a two-month low. The stock is losing sight of its 50-day moving average.Cirrus Logic reported that third-quarter revenue fell nearly 8% to $482.7 million, well below views for $532 million. Adjusted earnings dropped 15% to $1.59 per share, missing estimates for $1.77. Cirrus Logic also gave weak revenue guidance for the current quarter.Cirrus Logic shares fell 12% in early trading. The stock tumbled 4% Monday to 44.89, its worst level since July 2016.Skyworks earned $2 a share in the fiscal first quarter, up 12% vs. a year earlier, beating the estimate for $1.91. Revenue rose 15% to $1.05 billion. Skyworks guided lower for the current quarter, predicting EPS of $1.60 and revenue of about $910 million. Analysts had seen EPS of $1.63 and sales of $946.1 million.But that bad news may be priced into the stock, following weak guidance from Qorvo (QRVO), Qualcomm (QCOM) and Apple (AAPL) itself last week.Skyworks also announced a $1 billion stock-buyback program, equal to 5.8% of the float based on the current $17.34 billion market cap.Skyworks shares rose 2.5% early Tuesday.But that follows a 4.3% tumble to 94.68 Monday, the lowest since Dec. 26.

70,QCOM,"Futures for the S&P 500 index, Dow Jones industrial average and Nasdaq 100 were solidly higher Monday morning, with chip takeover buzz in focus and Apple (AAPL) near a buy point.X Chip stocks fueled the Nasdaq composite's drive to a new high Friday, and they'll stay active Monday, following a report that Intel (INTC) could bid for Broadcom (AVGO), which is mounting a hostile bid for Qualcomm (QCOM), which in turn in is trying to close a deal for NXP Semiconductors (NXPI). All four chipmakers are iPhone suppliers, with Intel's hopes for further Apple contracts at risk from a combined Broadcom-Qualcomm.As for Apple, its stock rose 1.7% to 179.98 on Friday, closing in on a 180.71 high-handle buy point in a V-shaped cup base. Apple was up 0.4% to 180.71 before the open on the stock market today, suggesting an open right at that entry.S&P 500 index futures climbed 0.25% above fair value. Dow Jones futures rose 0.4%. Nasdaq 100 futures were up 0.5%.On Friday, the S&P 500 and Dow retook their 50-day moving averages on Friday. The Nasdaq composite soared 4.2% for the week. Several top-rated chip stocks have broken out to buy zones, as semiconductors have powered ahead.Intel could mount a Broadcom bid if it appears that Broadcom is close to sealing a Qualcomm deal, the Wall Street Journal reported late Friday. It would be a defensive move. Intel modem chips are now being used in some iPhones instead of Qualcomm, which is in a major royalty fight with Apple. Intel could win more work in upcoming iPhone models, but a Broadcom-Qualcomm could mend fences with Apple.Broadcom shares jumped more than 3% to 261.63 early Monday after settling near there Friday night following a brief spike to 270.Intel and Qualcomm shares were little changed early Monday. NXP Semiconductors stock was not yet active.Sign Up For Free IBD Newsletters: Market Prep | Tech ReportAn actual deal between Intel, the world's largest chipmaker, with the big-cap Broadcom would likely raise huge antitrust concerns, with a lengthy, uncertain regulatory process and complicated divestitures. Intel would likely have to offer a big premium to Broadcom's price. And the lean-running Broadcom would offer few easy areas for Intel to pare costs.Meanwhile, Broadcom's Qualcomm quest faces longer odds now that the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. has raised national security concerns about such a deal. Broadcom is moving its headquarters from Singapore to the U.S., but that may not be enough.Qualcomm's board has resisted the deal, spurring Broadcom to mount a proxy fight with its own slate of directors. Qualcomm shareholders are due to vote on the rival slate at the company's annual meeting, with some reports stating that Broadcom was expected to win. The meeting was supposed to take place March 6, but CIFUS ordered a delay of at least one month.Qualcomm in turn is trying to buy NXP Semiconductors. The Dutch chipmaker is an Apple supplier, but its biggest role is in automotive chips. Qualcomm agreed to buy NXP Semi for $110 a share back in October 2016, but struggled to win over key NXP investors. On Feb. 20 Qualcomm raised its NXP offer to $127.50 a share, or $44 billion.That in turn spurred Broadcom to modify its Qualcomm offer. It'll pay $79 per share for Qualcomm if Qualcomm buys NXP. If there's no NXP deal, Broadcom's offer remains $82.Intel also could make smaller acquisitions as an alternative to Broadcom, the WSJ reported.Intel, for its part, said late Friday that it would not comment on the Broadcom speculation but said it's working to integrate its recent Altera and Mobileye deals.Intel shares hit a record high last week, clearing a short consolidation that was too short to be a proper base. Broadcom retook its 50-day and 200-day moving averages on Friday, a key step as it starts to build the right side of a consolidation going back to late November. But Broadcom's relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, has been lagging for several months and is near 52-week lows.Qualcomm shares, which shot up in November on the initial Broadcom offer, has been struggling in the past several weeks.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:The Big Picture: The Market Outlook Has ChangedApple Supplier, Lam Research Lead 5 Chip Stocks In Buy ZonesThese 5 Top China Nets Have New Buy Points; Now Study The ChartsChip Stocks To Watch And Semiconductor Industry News

71,QCOM,"Qualcomm and Apple face off this month in what could wind up being the most significant intellectual property dispute this nation has seen in decades.It boils down to this: The company that pioneered global smartphone connectivity — Qualcomm (QCOM) — and the company that currently holds 15.2% of the world's smartphone market — Apple (APPL) — are embroiled in a multibillion-dollar battle over the technology that makes these devices tick.The long-running dispute is actually multiple cases — approximately 50 separate legal actions filed in 16 jurisdictions across six countries, including a key hearing this month before the International Trade Commission (ITC) in Washington, D.C. Qualcomm is asking the ITC for what's known as an exclusion order — or a ban on the importation of certain iPhones that use inferior Intel modems.Its argument? That Apple is using Qualcomm's innovations without a license to do so.""Given their enormous market presence they think they can infringe (upon) our intellectual property with impunity,"" Qualcomm executive vice president and general counsel Don Rosenberg said last week. ""But we have the rule of law in our favor and so we're hoping to get their attention by asking a court to stop them from infringing.""Rosenberg is right. The rule of law is in Qualcomm's favor. And it is essential for our nation's economic future that it be upheld.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseMost of the media coverage related to this case has focused on its potential impact on smartphones (and the broader smartphone market) — and that's important. But it is much bigger than that.At the heart of this case is a fundamental question that could define the next century of technological advancement in this country: Do we still believe in innovation in America? Or, conversely, are we becoming a nation where patented technology can be stolen whenever a corporation decides it doesn't want to pay for it anymore?Qualcomm is the company that connected cellphones to the internet. It is responsible for 3G, 4G and is currently pioneering 5G — a ""new era of connectivity"" that will provide consumers, networks, businesses and smartphone manufacturers with super-high speed, ""fiber like"" wireless solutions. According to one economic impact study, 5G will add more than $3 trillion to our nation's gross domestic product and create upward of three million new jobs.Earlier this year, I advocated against, and President Trump ultimately blocked, a threatened takeover of Qualcomm by Broadcomm because the importance of the U.S. being the leader in 5G was widely recognized, and Qualcomm's integral role in developing 5G is indisputable. Without Qualcomm's innovation, the U.S. would cede its dominant position to other nations. It is clear that Qualcomm reinvests its licensing fees into critical research and development and Apple's continued refusal to compensate Qualcomm for its innovation could also hinder the company's (and thereby the country's) ability to advance 5G.Licensing the use of its patented innovations is the heart of Qualcomm's business. It is also what keeps the company and its nearly 40,000 employees in business. Qualcomm's patented modems and other innovations are so indispensable to the operation of smartphones and other mobile devices that the manufacturers of these devices have agreed to not only buy the company's chips — but pay Qualcomm for the right to use the underlying technology.Well, everybody pays except Apple — which is currently delinquent to the tune of up to $4.5 billion when it comes to licensing fees owed to Qualcomm.Apple insists it ""believe(s) deeply in the value of intellectual property,"" but its actions tell a different story. Not only is the company refusing to pay what it owes, it is being accused of infringing Qualcomm's intellectual property (the basis of the ITC complaint). The company is also trying to stonewall the courts in an effort to keep its conduct from coming to light.Last December, a federal judge in San Jose, California issued sanctions against Apple after it refused to turn over evidence related to one of the cases in this dispute.Qualcomm's position remains simple: Licensing agreements are an essential component of incentivizing innovation in this country.Without them, innovation dies.Or to put it another way: Do we want to kill off trillions of dollars in economic activity, and risk no longer being the leader in 5G, because one of the world's richest companies doesn't want to pay what it owes?Samsung Threatens U.S. Prosperity By Disregarding Intellectual-Property RightsHow Dodd-Frank Stole The Recovery By Killing Small-Business GrowthThe Economy Is Not An Engine — So Stop Describing It Like One

72,QCOM,"Chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO) announced late Wednesday that it plans to buy enterprise software firm CA Technologies (CA) for $18.9 billion in cash to create a leading infrastructure technology company.CA shares jumped over 16% to about 43.25 in after-hours trading on the stock market today after the Wall Street Journal reported a possible deal. Broadcom stock sank nearly 6% to 229 on the news.Under the terms of the agreement, CA's shareholders will receive $44.50 per share in cash. That represents a premium of about 20% to CA's closing price on Wednesday.The deal has been approved by the boards of directors of both companies. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including the approval of CA shareholders and antitrust approvals in the U.S., European Union and Japan.

CA makes information technology management software. Broadcom is a leading semiconductor device supplier to the wired, wireless, enterprise storage, and industrial markets.RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani said the deal is a head-scratcher.""While we understand the logic behind the attractive free-cash-flow stream at CA, investors will wrestle (with the) strategic rationale,"" he said in a note to clients.Big questions that need to be answered by Broadcom include: Why is it moving into the software space and how does this business mesh with its core operations?Investors also will want to know how broad the company plans to move beyond semiconductors in future mergers and acquisitions, Daryanani said.The acquisition comes just months after President Donald Trump blocked Broadcom's $117 billion purchase of wireless-chip maker Qualcomm (QCOM) on national security grounds. Broadcom recently moved its headquarters from Singapore to San Jose, Calif.Broadcom said the CA acquisition will be immediately accretive to its adjusted earnings per share. It also will help Broadcom drive its long-term adjusted profit margins above 55%.It will fund the deal with $18 billion in new debt financing plus cash on hand. Broadcom expects to maintain an investment grade rating, given its strong cash flow generation and intention to rapidly de-leverage, the company said.RELATED:Broadcom Beats Wall Street's Fiscal Second-Quarter Targets

74,QCOM,"The China trade war may be about to get better, not worse. Despite Wednesday's sell-off as the Trump administration identified $200 billion worth of potential targets for future Trump tariffs, the key moment is about to arrive that could see the ice break in the brewing technological cold war between the U.S. and China.Chinese communications equipment firm ZTE saw shares soar on Thursday as the U.S. agreed to let the company resume doing business with American suppliers, pending the receipt of a $400 million escrow payment.Meanwhile, Bloomberg News reported that both the U.S. and China are prepared to resume stalled trade negotiations.The confluence of events is likely no coincidence. President Trump's commitment to lift sanctions that amounted to a death sentence for ZTE seemed to break a logjam in U.S.-China trade negotiations back in May. Soon after, Trump touted a prospective trade deal with Beijing, tweeting that  ""China has agreed to buy massive amounts of ADDITIONAL Farm/Agricultural Products"" and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin said the China trade war had been put ""on hold"" amid progress in negotiations.Those negotiations stalled as Congress complicated Trump's pledge via tweet to get ZTE ""back into business, fast."" The Senate preserved the ban on doing business with ZTE in the national defense authorization bill, but those harsh terms may not be included in the final version expected to pass in late July.The stock market reaction on Wednesday came as the threat of escalating Trump tariffs became more tangible, though the likelihood of tariffs hadn't changed. In June, President Trump directed the Office of the Trade Representative to come up with a list of $200 billion worth of Chinese imports that could face 10% tariffs, and trade officials produced that list late Tuesday.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseStill, the market downdraft on Wednesday was fairly modest. Wall Street still seems to be betting that this round of Trump tariffs will never take flight and that China won't escalate its retaliation against U.S. multinationals. We'll probably know whether Wall Street is right within the next several weeks, as the White House prepares to impose the new tariffs by Aug. 30.As long as Congress hews to Trump's wishes and drops the Senate provision mandating a ban on U.S. firms doing business with the Chinese communications equipment firm, U.S.-China trade negotiations could quickly resume and begin to demonstrate progress.Beijing refuses to negotiate under duress, so there is still a risk the China trade war will escalate with more rounds of Trump tariffs. But a U.S. reprieve for ZTE and its 75,000 global employees may allow Xi to resume negotiations without losing face, despite the Trump tariffs already in place.Yet if ZTE gets a new lease on life and there isn't a nearly immediate thaw in the China trade war and threats of more Trump tariffs continue to fly, look out.This may be the last off-ramp before a full-scale trade war that threatens to seriously damage business prospects for U.S. multinationals in China and severely disrupt technology supply chains.The U.S. imported $506 billion in Chinese goods last year, meaning about half of Chinese imports would be affected by Trump's latest tariff threat.As Trump threatens a full-scale China trade war, Beijing vows to meet the U.S, blow for blow.While Chinese targets are somewhat limited by its $130 billion in American imports, Beijing has other ways to retaliate, and that's one of Wall Street's big fears.Beyond tariffs, U.S. multinationals could face other significant hurdles in China. Beijing could make life difficult for Dow Jones stocks like Boeing (BA), Caterpillar (CAT) and Apple (AAPL) via regulations.China's government also could hit Boeing sales, and likely Caterpillar, through its state-owned enterprises that can sway the market. Meanwhile, Beijing has been holding up the Qualcomm (QCOM) takeover of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI).The way things are going, there's little reason to expect China to blink in the face of Trump threats. BMW said this week that it will shift some SUV production from South Carolina to China in the face of Trump tariffs. Meanwhile, China's currency is losing ground vs. the dollar, counteracting the impact of Trump's threatened 10% tariffs on a wide range of consumer goods.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Stock Market Falls As Trump Threatens New Tariffs; Netflix Holds UpChip Equipment Stocks Get Price-Target Cuts On Market SlowdownThe Big Picture: Stocks Now Test These Critical LevelsStock Market Today: Track Market Trends And The Best Stocks To WatchHow To Invest In The Stock Market: Start With A Simple Routine

75,QCOM,"Less than a month after the Trump administration declared that the China trade war was ""on hold,"" it appears to be back on. And this time, there may be no turning back.President Trump on Friday imposed tariffs on $50 billion worth of mostly high-tech imports that will be subject to 25% tariffs. Some $34 billion will go into effect on July 6. China on Friday announced tariffs on $34 billion worth of U.S. goods, including agricultural goods. It's vowed to match U.S. tariffs swiftly and dollar for dollar.Trump had threatened more tariffs if China retaliates.What happens next will determine how big of a deal Trump's China trade war is for the economy and stock market. Yet there's clear risk that the conflict will escalate into a technological cold war.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe Dow Jones, down more than 1% at one point, pared its loss to 0.3% on the stock market today. The S&P 500 index slid 0.1% and the Nasdaq composite 0.2%.Tariffs on $34 billion in goods will take effect July 6. The other $16 billion are still subject to review.Once shots are fired, trade talks will get more difficult. The Trump administration says it has almost finished drawing up a list of another $100 billion of Chinese goods that could also face tariffs.Commodities prices for soybeans, corn and wheat have taken a hit ahead of the expected imposition of tariffs, while shares of Deere (DE), which thrives when American farmers are doing well, slid close to 5% in the past two days. That's quite a reversal after Trump's May 21 tweet touting an emerging trade deal that would see China ""buy massive amounts of ADDITIONAL Farm/Agricultural products"" from the U.S.So what happened? Trump may have concluded that the deal would have done relatively little to meet his goal of shrinking the U.S. trade deficit. After his meeting with North Korea's Kim Jong-un, Trump might feel his denuclearization push isn't so dependent upon China.Here's another possibility: Trump may have been bullied into the trade war. While the Trump administration has insisted that the enforcement action against Chinese communications equipment supplier ZTE was separate from the trade negotiation, it's not clear that Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed.The brief but favorable turn in China trade relations came after Trump tweeted that he and Xi were working to get ZTE ""back into business, fast."" That's after U.S. sanctions forced the Chinese telecom gear maker to cease operations. As punishment for continuing to doing business with Iran and North Korea in defiance of U.S. sanctions against those regimes, the Commerce Department ordered ZTE's key U.S. component suppliers to cease doing business with the firm.But Trump's leniency prompted a backlash. The Senate appears certain to attach a provision denying relief to ZTE to a defense funding bill. While the White House opposes that provision, it's unclear that Trump would veto must-pass defense legislation over the matter.With the fate of ZTE hanging in the balance, Chinese trade negotiators have frustrated their American counterparts. That, in turn, has strengthened the hand of Trump administration officials who have advocated taking a hard line against China and had the tariffs all ready to go.One ray of hope that a damaging trade war can be averted: China has reportedly granted approval to Qualcomm (QCOM) to buy NXP Semiconductors (NXPI). Chinese regulators appeared to delay approval amid the ZTE furor. But some reports said that China hasn't yet OK'd Qualcomm-NXP Semi.Qualcomm rose 0.7% Friday while NXP advanced 0.1%.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Dow Jones Futures Fall As Trump Steps Up China Trade War; Watch These Key StocksIBD Stock Of The Day: Dropbox Breaks Out As Software IPOs SurgeWhy This Biotech Is Bounding Closer To A BreakoutChart Reading For Beginners: What's In A Stock Chart?

77,QCOM,"Major stock indexes turned lower in afternoon trading Tuesday, unable to hold early gains despite another tame reading in consumer inflation before the open.X Semiconductor names Micron Technology (MU), Broadcom (AVGO) and Intel (INTC) were early outperformers in the Nasdaq 100, but gains  faded for all three.

Both numbers matched expectations. Year-over-year, core prices rose 1.8%, slightly below the consensus estimate of 1.9%, according to Econoday.Even as inflation data remain tame, the market is still expecting a quarter-point hike at the March 21 Federal Reserve meeting, putting the chances at around 89% according to the CME FedWatch Tool.In the stock market today, Century Aluminum (CENX) showed bullish price action after flashing a sell signal from a 20.78 buy point. Shares gapped above the 50-day moving average, rising around 7%. BMO Capital Markets on Monday upgraded shares to outperform from market perform and raised its price target to 28 from 20, citing positive effects from recently announced tariffs by the Trump administration.

80,QCOM,"The U.S.-China trade war started with the Trump administration accusing China of unfair practices related to the forced transfer of American technology and intellectual property. But U.S. tech companies are seeing little impact so far from the trade dispute as the U.S. on Friday imposed the first round of tariffs on Chinese goods.The U.S. is imposing an additional duty of 25% on about $34 billion worth of Chinese imports covering 818 products. The list does not include products commonly purchased by U.S. consumers such as mobile phones or televisions. It targets mostly products that are part of the ""Made in China 2025"" industrial policy. That policy includes industries such as aerospace, robotics, industrial machinery, new materials, and automobiles.The list of Chinese products impacted includes engines, motors, generators, furnaces, pumps, compressors, machine tools, and manufacturing, construction and agricultural equipment. It also includes aircraft and aircraft parts, cars, trucks, oil and gas drilling gear, television cameras and broadcast gear.China retaliated on Friday with 25% tariffs on imports of U.S. products, mostly agricultural goods. The impacted U.S. goods include grains, corn, soybeans, meat, fish, dairy, nuts, fruits and vegetables, alcohol and tobacco. China's levies also cover U.S.-made autos.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe U.S. is planning a second wave of tariffs covering 284 Chinese goods worth about $16 billion, but does not have an implementation date yet.""While tariffs on both sides should have limited direct head wind to IT (information technology) hardware and semiconductor companies, there are a few ways for U.S.-China trade wars to impact companies,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani said in a report Friday.For instance, companies that procure components and materials from China could see an uptick in their costs, he said.U.S. technology companies also could be subject to retaliatory actions by the Chinese government, Daryanani said. Memory-chip maker Micron Technology (MU) losing a patent infringement case in a Chinese court this week could be a result of the trade disputes, he said. Micron stock was up fractionally 53.23 at the close.Also, China has held up chipmaker Qualcomm's (QCOM) acquisition of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI). That deal has been ""in limbo 17 months and counting,"" Daryanani said. Shares of both were up fractionally in afternoon trades Friday.While the first wave of Chinese products subject to U.S. import tariffs includes computer hard disk drives, U.S. data storage systems vendors Seagate Technology (STX) and Western Digital (WDC) should see minimal impact, he said.The impact will be ""manageable and transitory"" given that Seagate and Western Digital also have factories outside of China, he said. Seagate stock was off 2 cents to 58.59 while Western added 0.6% to end the regular trading session at 77.93.If the trade conflict lingers, though, it could impact the U.S. tech industry in other ways. President Donald Trump has threatened to block Chinese investment in U.S. companies.That could cut off investment capital being used to fund such things as electric and self-driving vehicles.

But Micron said early Thursday it would not have meaningful impact on sales.The Philadelphia Semiconductor index rose just over 1% as it seeks support at the 200-day moving average.Last month, President Trump announced 25% duties on $50 billion worth of Chinese imports.

83,QCOM,"The U.S. economy is cruising along so well right now that it might take a stock-market rout to avert a Trump trade war.President Donald Trump touts his economic record on pretty much a daily basis of late and feels like he is launching trade conflicts from a position of strength. Now that verbal bombs aimed at Europe, Canada, Mexico, China and others are being followed by live tariffs and retaliatory action, the prospect for talks have never looked so dim.The trade conflict seems likely to get worse before it gets better. Meanwhile, Republicans in Congress have largely ruled out trying to wrest control of trade policy back from the White House.The only thing that might stop a trade war in its tracks — before the costs escalate — would be a suddenly lousy stock market that begins to put Trump's economic record and GOP control of Congress in jeopardy.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseSo far, the various trade actions are only expected to nick the U.S. GDP growth that has picked up steam.That's why the stock market, whose current prices adjust to reflect altered expectations for earnings and economic growth over the intermediate term, seems to be the most likely catalyst to head off a widening Trump trade war.But right now, stock markets appear only slightly worried. On Friday, the Trump administration said that it will impose 25% tariffs on $34 billion worth of mostly high-tech imports from China on July 6. That spurred China to announce $34 billion in retaliatory tariffs. The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 index sold off initially, but rallied to close Friday with modest losses.After a weak open Monday on the stock market today, the Dow Jones pared losses but notch its fifth straight down session, falling 0.4%. The S&P 500 closed 0.2% lower, and tech-heavy Nasdaq composite ended at break-even levels.For now, investors are cautiously optimistic, but that may not hold. Ed Yardeni, chief investment strategist of Yardeni Research, wrote that his bullish stock-market outlook requires Trump's ""benevolent Dr. Jekyll persona"" of tax-cutter and deregulator to triumph over his protectionist Mr. Hyde.""If his tariffs trigger widespread retaliation and an outright global trade war, then earnings will take a dive,"" Yardeni wrote. ""We continue to expect that it will all end peaceably. But it isn't heading in that direction right now.""UniCredit Group chief economist Erik Nielsen wrote that he thinks markets are too optimistic about the risk of a broadening trade war and sees potential for ""some rough months ahead in global equity markets.""""Markets haven't taken this increasingly serious risk into account, but rather focused on the ongoing macro developments, possibly dismissing Trump's threats,"" Nielsen wrote.Here's something to keep in mind: A couple of months before imposing retaliatory tariffs on the U.S., China suddenly stopped buying soybeans from U.S. farmers, shifting orders to Brazil and Canada. Suddenly, China started subjecting shipments of Ford Motor (F) vehicles, apples and pork to closer inspection and other regulatory hurdles.A Trump trade war can hurt U.S. multinationals with big China exposure like Caterpillar (CAT), Boeing (BA) and Apple (AAPL) beyond official tariffs or quotas. The U.S. increasingly looks as if it is headed into a technological cold war with China. China doesn't want to disrupt its economy as it is still developing its technological capabilities. But Beijing may seek opportunities to steer business to non-U.S. countries as it looks to divide America from potential allies in a trade war vs. China.After Trump appeared ready to greenlight component sales to ZTE, bringing it back from the dead, China seemed ready to sign off on the Qualcomm (QCOM) takeover of NXP Semiconductors. Yet now the Qualcomm deal may again be in jeopardy.On Monday, Qualcomm stock fell 1.1%. As for notable Dow Jones stocks, Caterpillar and Boeing closed down 0.9%. Apple, which outsources its iPhone manufacturing in China, edged 0.1% lower.Trump seemed to understand this dynamic when he kicked around the idea of joining the Trans-Pacific Partnership trading bloc. Yet Trump has instead stiff-armed U.S. allies in trade talks and weakened his leverage with China. So it may take a stock-market tumble to convince Trump that the trade-war campaign isn't working.After the stock market panned his steel and aluminum tariffs, Trump, albeit temporarily, granted broad exemptions that minimized both their economic impact and investor concern.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Forget Trump: Why We're Headed For A Long, Cold U.S. And China Trade WarThis Four Top Stocks Are Near Buy PointsJD.com Up On Google Investment, Retail Infrastructure PlansIf You Missed These Explosive China Stocks, Here's How You Could Get InChart Reading For Beginners: What's In A Stock Chart?

Entegris' early gain broke the stock out past a 38.35 buy point in third stage cup base.Despite powerful gains by Qualcomm and NXP, heavy early losses from Vodafone Group (VOD) and Lam Research (LRCX) helped drag the Nasdaq 100 into negative premarket territory.But Nasdaq-listed Zscaler spiked 31.8% at the open. The security software play's fiscal third-quarter results showed its loss narrowed to 2 cents a share during the quarter, vs. expectations for an 8-cent per-share loss. Revenue rose a much-better-than-forecast 50%. Zscaler has soared nearly 17% since the start of June, to 92% above its March IPO price.

Apple hopes to reduce its production costs for the next-generation iPhones so it can lower their retail pricing.Apple's choice of Qorvo for high-frequency filtering technology ""is one of several instances whereby Apple is seemingly moving from 'best available' to 'good enough' to maintain an iPhone standard of functionality,"" Shah said.The same holds true for Apple's use of Intel's modem over Qualcomm's offering, he said.Broadcom shares fell 3.1% to 228.10 amid a broad sell-off on the stock market today.

But shoe, auto parts, truck, construction machinery, movie, aerospace and wireless telecom service stocks fell 1% or more.Just three of the 30 components within the Dow industrial average climbed 1 point or more, including IBM (IBM) (still deep within a base) and Goldman Sachs (GS) (trying to clear a 273.89 entry in a new flat base). Fellow Dow Jones 30 member Intel (INTC) struggled, losing 0.84, or 1.6%, to 51.35. Volume was running 12% above average.Intel last week hopped out of a flawed cup base that formed in less than six weeks. Yet the chipmaking titan is having a positive 2018 so far, up more than 10%. The Santa Clara, Calif., tech bellwether has enjoyed healthy double-digit profit increases in five of the six past quarters, up 21%, 4%, 22%, 22%, 26% and 37% vs. year-ago levels.The Street expects Intel to grow first-quarter profit by 8% to 71 cents a share.Four components in the price-weighted Dow also sank 1 point or more, including Home Depot (HD), Caterpillar (CAT) and United Technologies (UTX).Leading companies, in terms of fundamentals, relative price strength and quality fund sponsorship, include Alibaba (BABA) (basing), Broadcom (AVGO) (also in a base), Booking Holdings (BKNG) (up 7% from a breakout point at 2,068.09 and thus extended) and Ligand Pharmaceuticals (LGND) (slightly out of the 5% proper buy zone after clearing a flat base at 170.40).Ligand was showcased in IBD's Stock Spotlight column on March 6, two days before the stock broke out of its five-week flat base, one of the most important chart patterns that can help growth investors time their buys for maximum gains and minimum risk during a confirmed stock market uptrend.On Friday, the IBD Big Picture column noted that the rise by the Nasdaq composite to all-time highs ended the ""Uptrend under pressure"" phase that began on March 1.All four companies have a record of smashing the performance of the S&P 500 and other benchmarks. Only Broadcom, still in a quest to acquire fellow wireless chip technology giant Qualcomm (QCOM), is lagging the S&P 500 in year-to-date performance. Broadcom, however, gapped up more than 3% to 262.58 in fast turnover and is now up more than 1% year to date.Broadcom, the product of a mega-merger with Singapore's Avago Technologies, is up 554% since clearing a nearly 18-month base-on-base pattern with a 39.84 buy point in the week ended Sept. 20, 2013. The company has superior earnings growth, with profit rising 29%, 38%, 51%, 46%, 42% and 32% vs. year-ago levels in the past six quarters.Revenue picked up 119%, 125%, 134%, 18%, 18%, and 17% in the same time frame. The merger between Broadcom and Avago accounted largely for the triple-digit top-line gains in prior quarters.Analysts see earnings in the January-ended fiscal first quarter rising 39% to $5.03 a share on a 28% jump in sales to $5.32 billion.As noted in IBD's Earnings Calendar, Broadcom is slated to report Q1 results on Thursday.Like the one formed recently by Ligand, a good flat base must form over a minimum five weeks and correct no greater than 10% to 15% from head to toe. Such action indicates tight price action and a general unwillingness among large fund managers to dump their shares.Ligand has scored a ninth straight advance, rising more than 2% to 179.92 in volume running more than 100% above usual levels. Before the stock broke out, its relative strength line jumped into new high ground, a bullish sign.The relative strength line, painted in blue in all IBD charts and in MarketSmith, compares a stock's price performance with the S&P 500.On Feb. 21, the specialist in developing treatments for numerous difficult and chronic diseases posted a 77% leap in fourth-quarter profit to $1.31 a share as revenue rose 32% to $50.5 million.As noted in this IBD New America piece, Ligand earns royalties based on the therapies and technology platforms it sells to larger pharmaceutical and biotech firms. In February, management noted it currently has 165 platforms in development together with more than 95 business partners.Ligand joined IBD Leaderboard last week.Shares are up more than 30% since Jan. 1, while at 2786 the S&P 500 is up 4.2%. The Nasdaq composite is up nearly 10%.Alibaba, one of China's leading e-commerce firms, had a huge 2017 as shares rolled 96% higher that year, vs. a 19.4% lift by the S&P 500.The stock sprinted higher in January, then caved in step with the market. However, notice how the stock refused to sink below its long-term 200-day moving average (visible as the black line on a MarketSmith chart). After a strong run-up, it's not uncommon for leading stocks to not only sharply undercut the 50-day moving average but also test buying support at the 200-day line as well.The 200-day moving average traces a stock's average price close over the past 200 trading sessions, or roughly 10 months' of price action. You want to see the 200-day line rising. Plus, a leading stock will lead its 50- and 200-day moving averages higher.Alibaba has fallen a mild 18% in its current base, which so far has the makings of a cup base.The latest pullback is not a proper handle. Why? The midpoint test shows that the handle didn't form up high enough within the cup itself.The midpoint of the cup (the base's intraday high plus intraday low, divided by 2) is 187.54, while the midpoint of the handle is 185.30.In a good cup with handle, the midpoint of the handle is usually higher than the base's midpoint. A good cup with handle must also form within a minimum seven weeks.Alibaba has scored EPS gains of 39%, 30%, 37%, 60%, 63% and 25% vs. year-ago levels in the past six quarters. Such results help boost the stock's Earnings Per Share Rating to a 97 on a scale of 1 to 99 in IBD Stock Checkup, and the megacap member of IBD's Retail-Internet industry group shows an equally robust 98 Composite Rating.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters see first-quarter earnings rising 49% to 94 cents a share.One concern is that fourth-quarter aftertax margin fell by 970 basis points to 32.5% vs. the year-ago period. That broke a two-quarter string of rising net margins.The Dow transportation average, a 17.3% gainer in 2017, fell nearly 0.6% before rebounding some and is now off 0.2%. At 10,712, it's up almost 1% since Jan. 1.In other financial markets, WTI crude oil futures fell 1.7% to $60.92 a barrel while gold, silver and copper futures backtracked 0.3% to 0.6%.The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond edged lower to 2.88%, still up from 2.41% at the start of the year.(Please follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for more analysis and commentary on growth stocks, breakouts, and financial markets.)RELATED:Inside IBD's Stock Spotlight: Can This Hot China Consumer Spending Play Break Out Again?Who Are The Global Stock Leaders On Wall Street?Intel, Broadcom, Qualcomm Buzz Has A Lot To Do With AppleThese 5 Top China Nets Have New Bases, Buy PointsHow To Score Big Profits With A Small Account?

96,QCOM,"President Donald Trump's No. 1 rule for making deals is to always come to the table with leverage. But on Sunday, Trump tweeted that he would give up perhaps his biggest leverage in trade talks with China: sanctions on Chinese telecom equipment giant ZTE that amounted to a death sentence.So what did Trump get in return for letting ZTE off the hook for violations that included defying a ban on sales to Iran and North Korea? Far from hacking $100 billion to $200 billion from the U.S. trade deficit with China, as Trump had demanded, the deal reported to be emerging would mostly restore the status quo before trade tensions erupted in March.Since then China has put the brakes on purchases of U.S. soybeans, even before it was set to impose 25% tariffs in retaliation for Trump's threatened tariffs on $50 billion worth of mostly high-tech imports from China. Meanwhile goods from pork to Ford (F) cars have piled up at Chinese ports amid tighter inspections meant to punish U.S. producers.Beijing made a bet that the U.S. wouldn't be able to endure tariffs aimed at U.S. farmers, with an eye on punishing Republicans at the polls in November. It appears, at the moment, that Beijing's calculation was on the money. When China first detailed its plan to match Trump's tariffs blow for blow, Trump threatened to impose tariffs on an additional $100 billion worth of Chinese goods, but that now looks like mere bluster.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseStock market investors viewed the trade developments as good news, diminishing economic risk. The S&P 500, Dow Jones and Nasdaq composite slashed moderate gains to close slightly higher on the stock market today, China wasn't to blame. Qualcomm (QCOM), a key beneficiary of Trump's latest deal making, held onto early gains, rising 2.7%.Beijing said it would restart its regulatory review Qualcomm's pending purchase of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) after earlier halting that process. That suspension followed Trump's move in March to block Singapore-based Broadcom (AVGO) from buying Qualcomm. NXP rose 12% on Monday.Both China and the U.S. are focused on which country's tech firms will develop next-generation 5G wireless network systems. Collaboration increasingly seems to be off the table. The U.S. also is said to be investigating Chinese communications equipment giant Huawei for violating U.S. sanctions policy.Trump tweeted that he was working with Chinese President Xi Jinping to give ZTE ""a way to get back into business, fast,"" after the Chinese mobile-phone company halted operations due to U.S. sanctions that kept it from buying key components from U.S. suppliers.U.S. optical components makers that are big ZTE suppliers rallied Monday. Acacia Communications (ACIA), Lumentum Holdings (LITE) and Oclaro (OCLR), which had sold off April 16 on the ZTE ban, were winners Monday, but off session highs.One more possible explanation for Trump's dramatic ZTE reversal: He may be putting his North Korean diplomatic initiative ahead of trade goals and is working to shore up Beijing's support.Jefferies economist Ward McCarthy called the softening of the U.S. position on ZTE ""an encouraging development."" ""It suggests that the U.S. and China are both making progress on trade talks and trying to find ways for both sides to be able walk away from the table and claim that they won concessions, saving face in the process,"" he wrote.Yet Trump's comments about letting ZTE off the hook because ""too many jobs in China"" were at stake prompted something of a backlash. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., responded that the ""Problem with ZTE isn't jobs & trade, it's national security & espionage.""On Monday, Trump defended his ZTE reversal, noting the impact on U.S. companies and the ""larger trade deal"" being worked on with China.ZTE, the large Chinese phone company, buys a big percentage of individual parts from U.S. companies. This is also reflective of the larger trade deal we are negotiating with China and my personal relationship with President Xi.— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 14, 2018Last month, the Pentagon banned sales of handsets from ZTE and Chinese communications-equipment giant Huawei on military bases, saying they represented a potential national security threat.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Top Payments Stock Breaks Out, Joining These 3 Peers In Buy ZonesApple's Big Run Teaches Crucial Lesson For Investing SuccessStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksBreakout Watch: Biotech Stock With 172% Growth Enters Buy ZoneTech Stocks Advance As This Top Chinese Stock Nears A Breakout

That compared with 233,000 claims in the prior week, below projections for an uptick to 235,000 new applications.The Labor Department's preliminary estimate on fourth-quarter productivity showed a 0.1% dip, far below the monster 2.7% surge in the third quarter as well as consensus estimates for a 1.1% increase. Unit labor costs popped 2%, vs. a 0.2% decline in the third quarter and estimates for a 0.9% increase — adding to inflation fears raised by the Fed on Wednesday.The dollar reversed some of its recent gains vs. the yen, buoyed by the wary view toward inflation conveyed in Wednesday's policy announcement from the Federal Reserve. Stocks in Japan responded, sending Tokyo's Nikkei 225 to a muscular rebound, up 1.7%, and ending the six-day decline that had followed currency comments from U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in Davos, Switzerland, last week.China's markets continued lower, with the Shanghai Composite down 1% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index taking a 0.8% loss.In Europe, markets turned lower in afternoon trade.

101,QCOM,"Broadcom (AVGO) stock jumped on Friday after the chipmaker announced a massive share buyback plan designed to boost shareholder returns.Broadcom shares climbed 3.1% to close at 246.94 on the stock market today, for a gain of 7.51. The stock has been consolidating over the past 20 weeks, establishing a buy point of 285.78.The San Jose, Calif.-based company announced late Thursday that its board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $12 billion of its common stock. The authorization is effective immediately until Nov. 3, 2019, the end of Broadcom's 2019 fiscal year .""The initiation of a stock repurchase program enhances our capital allocation strategy and provides us with a complementary tool to deliver value to our shareholders,"" Broadcom Chief Financial Officer Tom Krause said in a news release. ""We are maintaining our policy of delivering 50% of trailing 12-month free cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends while adding the ability to use the balance of our free cash flow not only for acquisitions but also for opportunistic buybacks.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseWall Street analysts gave thumbs-up reviews to Broadcom's stock buyback authorization.RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani maintained his ""top pick"" buy rating on Broadcom and price target of 325.The buyback plan should allay some investor concerns about the company's strategy to increase shareholder value, he said.Raymond James analyst Chris Caso reiterated his strong buy rating on Broadcom stock on the news. He estimates the buyback would be 10% to 15% accretive to fiscal 2020 earnings per share. That assumes it is completed and with shares bought within recent trading ranges.Also, Caso expects the stock's dividend yield to be about 4% by December.""Longer term, we think a reaffirmation of Broadcom's commitment to continue returning cash flow to investors will be helpful in attracting value/income-oriented investors to the stock,"" he said in a note to clients.After its failed bid to buy Qualcomm (QCOM), Broadcom is likely to pursue smaller mergers and acquisitions going forward, Caso said.Meanwhile, Qualcomm shares were up 1% to 55.73. Former Qualcomm Chairman Paul Jacobs is assembling a group of buyers for the wireless-chip maker.Jacobs is talking to strategic investors and sovereign wealth funds in a bid to take Qualcomm private, CNBC reported late Thursday. One potential investor is chip designer ARM, which was purchased by Japan's SoftBank in 2016, CNBC said.RELATED:Data Storage Key Link In Emerging Data-Centered Computing CycleASML, Lam Research, Taiwan Semiconductor Kick Off Chip Earnings SeasonApple, Intel Lead Top Tech-Stock Play In Potential Buy Range

Gaming stocks took flight after a Supreme Court ruling cleared the way for legalized sports betting in the U.S.Gains in the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq ranged from 0.1% to 0.3%. The Russell 2000 small-cap index hit an all-time high on an intraday basis, but it reversed lower, falling 0.3%. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq was tracking close to Friday's levels.In the stock market today, NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) jumped 13% on reports that China has resumed its review of Qualcomm's (QCOM) proposed buyout of the Dutch chip firm for around $44 billion. Qualcomm added 3%.Other semiconductor stocks performed well. In the chipmaker group, Analog Devices (ADI) is back near highs after a failed breakout.

Shares still rose 1%.Stocks in IBD's Leisure-Gaming/Equipment outperformed after the Supreme Court paved the way for legalized sports betting in the U.S. Scientific Games (SGMS) jumped out of a cup-with-handle base with a 55 buy point.

Earnings from China Lodging are due today after the close.Baidu (BIDU), meanwhile, popped out of a lengthy consolidation with a conventional entry at 275.07, 10 cents above its Oct. 17 intraday high. But gains faded as shares recently traded around 274.Elsewhere, fiber-optic stocks rallied sharply on news that a key customer, China-based smartphone maker ZTE, might get a lifeline from President Trump. The U.S. Commerce Department in April banned fiber-optic firms from selling components to ZTE. Top percentage gainers in the group included Oclaro (OCLR), Acacia (ACIA) and Lumentum (LITE).

104,QCOM,"Stocks remained broadly lower as Apple's (AAPL) iPhone X news weighed. A Bitcoin play, however, bucked the broad decline.X PowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ) trimmed its loss to 0.2%, while SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) and SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) gave up 0.3% each. Emerging markets tumbled with iShares MSCI Emerging Markets (EEM) down 1.2%.Apple, down 2%, was one of the Dow's biggest losers. Shares slid further below the 50-day moving average. They had re-cleared a 176.34 last week before reversing lower. The iPhone maker reports earnings on Thursday. Apple is cutting its iPhone X production by half amid disappointing sales, Japan's Nikkei reported Monday.Homebuilders, utilities and real estate led the downside among sector funds in the stock market today. Oil and gold plays pulled back along with prices for the underlying commodities. VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners (GDXJ) and VanEck Vectors Gold Miners (GDX) dropped 3% and 2.4%, respectively.Bitcoin also came under pressure, falling 4% to $11,231.09, according to CoinDesk. It had initially climbed to $11,765.40. Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC), however, rose 6%. It remains slightly below its 50-day line.Biotechs, banks and retail were among the few groups bucking the selloff. IShares Nasdaq Biotechnology (IBB) advanced 1% to its best level since August 2015. Gilead Sciences (GILD) surged 5%, sailing past an 86.37 cup-base buy point, to follow up on Friday's big move. Ablynx (ABLX) soared 12% after Sanofi said it's buying the Belgium-based biotech for $4.8 billion.Propelled by top tech stocks like Intel (INTC) and Nvidia (NVDA), the stock market continues rising to new highs. Many leveraged funds have generated even higher returns for those who don't mind taking on extra potential risk.Leveraged funds designed to outperform on the way up often aim for double or triple a particular benchmark index's performance. Likewise, those designed to act inverse to the index can snare big gains when the index sinks, but drop if the index rallies. These high-octane plays aren't for the fainthearted.Three emerging markets plays topped the list of leveraged ETFs with biggest year-to-date gains through Jan. 24, according to Morningstar Direct. Direxion Daily FTSE China Bull 3X (YINN) has surged 53.1%, far out in front of the S&P 500's 6.2% advance. It had a big 2017 too, racking up a 129.8% gain. YINN's average annual return for the past three years is 8.6%, trailing the S&P 500's 13.8% for the same period.Direxion Daily MSCI Brazil Bull 3X (BRZU) came in second with a 47.3% YTD gain. A 30.8% gain last year outpaced the S&P 500, but its three-year performance is -12%. Direxion Daily Russia Bull 3X (RUSL), in third, is up 38.9% this year. It ended 2017 with a 1% gain; its three-year average annual return is 20.3%.Given such relatively inconsistent long-term performance, most traders generally view leveraged funds as a short-term investment. Another point to keep in mind: Leverage plays tend to have higher costs. YINN, BRZU and RUSL carry expense ratios of 1.3%, 1.1% and 1.1%, respectively, compared with iShares MSCI Brazil's (EWZ) 0.6%.All of the ETFs in the accompanying table are currently extended from buy points. But if you find such leveraged plays appealing, watch for a new consolidation or a pullback to the 50-day moving average.Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bull 3X (SOXL) is extended from a 167.60 entry of a cup with handle. But declines Wednesday and Thursday have brought it closer to buy range. The $678.1 million fund was featured in this ETF column on Jan. 18, a day after its breakout. It rose as much as 12% from the breakout to its Jan. 23 peak. SOXL surged 50%-plus from a prior breakout in September to a Nov. 22 intraday high.The ETF, which aims to deliver 300% of the daily performance of the PHLX Semiconductor Sector Index, will mark its eighth anniversary in March. The top five names in the index as of Dec. 31 were Texas Instruments (TXN), Intel, Qualcomm (QCOM), Nvidia and Broadcom (AVGO). Intel surged 11% after reporting better-than-expected Q4 results late Thursday.Nvidia, known for its graphics chips used in personal computers, game consoles and mobile devices, is also becoming a big player in the self-driving car and artificial intelligence fields. Shares are at all-time highs.SOXL has delivered a 26.6% YTD gain, 141.7% in 2017 and a three-year average annual return of 77.8%. Its expense ratio is 1.1%.Friday's pick, SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 High Dividend (SPYD), is near the top of a potential buy zone from a rebound off the 50-day line.RELATED:Intel, Nvidia Power Dow, S&P To Highs; Bitcoin Below Key SupportApple Loses Support But Dow At High; Bitcoin Play Goes PositiveCan You Make A Million Dollars By Trading ETFs?

106,QCOM,"The year ahead for Apple (AAPL) could bring a lineup of jumbo-sized iPhones and an internet television service, Wall Street and technology analysts speculate.Apple kicked off what many expect to be a major iPhone upgrade cycle with the Nov. 3 release of the iPhone X. The new flagship smartphone is Apple's biggest iPhone redesign in three years. The device features a 5.8-inch OLED display, a facial recognition security feature, wireless charging, augmented reality capabilities and other enhancements.Apple hopes to keep the momentum going with its 12th-generation smartphones, scheduled for release in fall 2018.Respected Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities thinks the 2018 iPhone lineup will include three handsets with screen sizes as big as or bigger than the iPhone X, which has the largest iPhone display to date.Kuo believes Apple will come out with a refreshed 5.8-inch OLED model and a premium 6.5-inch OLED iPhone, plus a 6.1-inch LCD handset. Analysts with investment bank Nomura are predicting the same lineup.The new OLED iPhones will be pitched to high-end smartphone customers, while the new LCD iPhone will be positioned as a mid-range device, Kuo said. Apple also plans to refresh its entry-level iPhone SE early in 2018, he said.What the new iPhones will be called is the subject of much debate. Apple complicated its naming scheme with the fall 2017 release of the iPhone 8 series and the 10th-anniversary iPhone X, pronounced ""ten"" as in the Roman numeral. It skipped the number nine in its naming system.The new iPhones likely will include high-speed antenna modules for gigabit LTE connectivity, Kuo said. That's an area where Apple has lagged rivals in adoption of the latest standards. Kuo predicts that 70% to 80% of the new baseband processors will come from Intel (INTC) because Apple is embroiled in a legal fight with wireless-chip leader Qualcomm (QCOM) over patent royalty rates and terms.IBD'S TAKE: For a roundup of 2018 predictions for the stock market, visit the IBD page ""2018 Stock Market Outlook: What To Watch For In The New Year.""The iPhone business is vitally important to Apple. Sales of iPhone handsets alone accounted for 62% of Apple's revenue in its fiscal year ended Sept. 30. Plus, some of Apple's accessories and services businesses are directly tied to the iPhone.The big question Apple must answer in the New Year is whether the iPhone X and iPhone 8 series phones have sparked a ""supercycle"" of upgrades or not, GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives told Investor's Business Daily.Apple will have to outsell the 231 million units the iPhone 6 series sold to be considered a success, he said.""If it's anything north of 240 million, I would characterize it as a supercycle,"" he said. ""The next few quarters are huge 'prove me' quarters for Apple to show that there's still mojo on the smartphone side.""Apple's competitors in the smartphone business aren't about to roll over. Samsung is expected to release its Galaxy S9 smartphones in March. And Chinese handset makers are giving Apple headaches in China, the world's largest mobile phone market. Plus, Chinese smartphone makers Huawei and Xiaomi are reportedly in talks with U.S. wireless operators, including AT&T (T) and Verizon (VZ), about selling their smartphones to American consumers as soon as 2018.In early 2018, Apple is expected to release its premium voice-activated wireless music speaker HomePod. The $349 device was supposed to be out in the holiday shopping season, but Apple delayed the launch in November to fine-tune the product.It will compete with wireless speakers with voice-response technology such as the Amazon (AMZN) Echo speakers and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google Home.Smart speakers are seen as a foot in the door to sell consumers more smart home technologies, such as connected thermostats and lighting, which people can control with voice commands.Meanwhile, Apple's next-generation Apple Watch could include an advanced heart-monitoring feature, making the wearable a serious medical device. Apple wants to add an electrocardiogram sensor to the smartwatch to spot cardiac problems, Bloomberg reported.Apple's fastest growing business is its services division, which includes such things as Apple Music, iCloud, Apple Pay and the App Store.Some research firms such as CCS Insight think Apple will launch a subscription video-on-demand service next year to take on Netflix (NFLX), Amazon and others in the fast-growing sector.Apple has hired some major Hollywood executives to buy original television series for the new service.Among the shows it has reportedly secured are a reboot of the 1980s anthology series ""Amazing Stories"" from producer Steven Spielberg; a drama about a TV morning news show starring Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon; and a new space-themed drama series from Ronald Moore, a writer and show runner known for his work on ""Star Trek: The Next Generation,"" as well his mid-2000s revival of the ""Battlestar Galactica"" series.Apple management has revealed little about its video efforts, other than to say the company is exploring the market and seeing where it leads.RELATED:Apple To Launch Netflix Rival In 2018, Research Firm PredictsApple HomePod Speaker Delayed, Will Miss Holiday Shopping SeasonApple Could Reach $1 Trillion Market Cap In 2018, Analyst Says

107,QCOM,"The semiconductor industry saw some major acquisitions announced in late 2017, and analysts expect the merger activity to continue in 2018.As the new year begins, Broadcom (AVGO) is preparing for a hostile takeover attempt of Qualcomm (QCOM). Qualcomm rejected Broadcom's Nov. 6 buyout offer worth $130 billion and has refused to negotiate with the suitor.In addition to Qualcomm's resistance, the deal must pass muster with antitrust regulators.Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL) unit Google are among companies that have expressed private concerns to Qualcomm about the impact of a Broadcom takeover, CNBC reported Dec. 8.Broadcom has nominated a slate of candidates to replace Qualcomm's current board of directors and it will be put to a shareholder vote at Qualcomm's 2018 annual meeting, scheduled for March 6.Meanwhile, Qualcomm is still trying to close its $47 billion acquisition of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), which was announced in October 2016.Another major chip industry deal, announced Nov. 20, is the $6 billion purchase of Cavium (CAVM) by Marvell Technology Group (MRVL).""With debt still relatively cheap, we think the consolidation trend will continue in 2018, and perhaps accelerate as many serial acquirers have reduced leverage and may be looking to strike again,"" Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Christopher Rolland said in a Dec. 12 report.Leading takeover candidates for 2018 include Integrated Device Technology (IDTI), Lattice Semiconductor (LSCC), MaxLinear (MXL) and Microsemi (MSCC), Rolland said.KeyBanc Capital Markets identified Cypress Semiconductor (CY) and Teradyne (TER) as its top picks to get acquired. Other potential takeout candidates include Ambarella (AMBA), Silicon Labs (SLAB), Nanometrics (NANO) and Micron Technology (MU), KeyBanc said in a Dec. 15 report.""Consolidation in semiconductors will increasingly be driven by the need to increase scale to enable higher levels of research and development spending,"" KeyBanc said.IBD'S TAKE: For the latest news on chip stocks, visit IBD's news page Chip Stocks To Watch And Semiconductor Industry News.The potential for mergers and acquisitions is likely to put a floor under semiconductor stocks, mitigating any potential large pullbacks in the group, JPMorgan analyst Harlan Sur said in a Dec. 1 report.""In an era of slowing growth and lower cyclicality, industry players are looking to M&A to increase diversification/scale, extend market leadership positions, and drive higher profitability and capital returns,"" Sur said.The chip market is being helped by demand strength in such markets as processors for artificial intelligence, automotive, cryptocurrencies and data centers, Susquehanna's Rolland said.RELATED:Chip Merger Activity Continues Apace With Silicon Labs Deal

Micron Technology (MU), which already topped a double-bottom buy point, cleared an alternate entry and soared to a 17-year high amid continued strong memory-chip demand and pricing. .Target (TGT), which plans to hike its minimum wage to $12 an hour, missed profit views and fell short of consensus for EPS guidance.

111,QCOM,"Wall Street got a break from Fed rate-hike worries on Thursday for a change. But the Dow Jones industrial average couldn't catch a break amid a new outbreak of concern about a China trade war and a growing sense that a messy impeachment fight for President Trump could be in the cards.XThe Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite all fell sharply in morning trade on Thursday, before staging an afternoon recovery. The Dow Jones roared back from down nearly 400 points to close with a whisper-thin gain. The S&P 500 index rebounded from below its 200-day moving average to end with modest losses. Meanwhile, the safety bid sent gold prices higher and Treasury yields lower.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, arriving in Beijing with a team of negotiators, was greeted by news that China has stopped buying soybeans from U.S. producers.China warned last month that it will retaliate against U.S. farmers if President Trump makes good on his threat to impose 25% tariffs on $50 billion worth of mostly high-tech Chinese imports.But Trump's decision on whether to follow through on that threat isn't due until next month. The takeaway is that China looks unlikely to yield to U.S. threats and thinks it can take advantage of Trump's political vulnerabilities.Meanwhile, Horizon Investments strategist Greg Valliere, who has long tracked political developments for Wall Street, wrote Thursday that he now sees at least 50% odds that Trump will face House impeachment in early 2019. Odds of removal from office are still low, but rising, he wrote.Valliere said he changed his assessment after several recent developments: The leaked questions that Special Counsel Robert Mueller wants to ask Trump include many about Trump campaign dealings with Russia. Trump just dismissed his top attorney, Ty Cobb, who wanted his client to cooperate with the Mueller probe. And now Rudy Giuliani, who has joined the Trump legal team, said that Trump repaid Michael Cohen for the $130,000 hush-money payment to Stormy Daniels just before the election.Unlike the Clinton impeachment, the stock market would seem to have a big stake in a potential Trump impeachment. Not least, the 21% corporate tax rate could be low-hanging fruit for a future Democratic president with new spending priorities to fund.Valliere thinks the stock market can surmount impeachment fears, but he adds that trade war and Fed rate-hike concerns make for a pretty serious wall of worry.Shares of U.S. agribusiness Bunge (BG) fell 3.5% after Bloomberg reported comments from the company's CEO saying that China has shifted soybean purchases to Canada and Brazil, at least temporarily.Trump has taken a softer tack toward China in recent weeks. Late Wednesday, he tweeted about his good relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping while noting negotiations to create ""a level playing field on trade."" A few weeks earlier, Trump tweeted that he was ""very thankful"" for Xi's speech offering concessions on trade, even as China said nothing new was offered.Given the tone set by Trump and his political interest in avoiding tit-for-tat tariffs that undermine his support in the Midwest, a full-fledged trade war with China continues to look unlikely. However, a cold war over trade could happen and isn't without risk for investors.Just as U.S. soybean purchases were halted without announcement or the imposition of tariffs, China could quietly target companies like Dow Jones components Boeing (BA) or Caterpillar (CAT). A cold war may already be on in advanced technology sectors. After the U.S. blocked Broadcom (AVGO) from buying Qualcomm (QCOM) because of its ties to Chinese telecom firms, China retaliated by delaying Qualcomm's acquisition of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI).YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:No Fed Rate Hike, But Here's Why The Dow Jones Can't Get A Head Of SteamIf You Like Apple, You'll Love These 6 Market-Beating Stock PlaysThe 'Apple Of Oil' Near Buy Point Ahead Of Earnings After The CloseAmazon, These 5 IBD 50 Stocks Share This Winning Growth TraitHere's Why Anyone Can Time The Stock Market BottomLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

Inflation is expected to rise in 2018, say some economists, which could hike borrowing costs and interest expenses.IBD'S TAKE: Finding the best stocks to buy can be tricky. That's why Investor's Business Daily makes it easy with educational tools, stock lists, research, Leaderboard and more.Also among companies that issued the most bonds were Verizon Communications (VZ), Broadcom (AVGO) and Microsoft (MSFT). Verizon ranked No. 3, issuing $25.6 billion in bonds, Broadcom followed at $17.6 billion and Microsoft was next at $17 billion.Cable TV firm Comcast (CMCSA), Oracle (ORCL) and Qualcomm (QCOM) also were in the top 10 of bond issuers. Qualcomm has yet to close its purchase of NXP Semiconductors.

The commission said Qualcomm prevented rivals from competing in the market by making significant payments to a key customer, Apple (AAPL), on condition it not buy from rivals, including Intel (INTC).""Qualcomm illegally shut out rivals from the market for LTE baseband chip sets for over five years, thereby cementing its market dominance,"" Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in a written statement. ""Qualcomm paid billions of U.S. dollars to a key customer, Apple, so that it would not buy from rivals. These payments were not just reductions in price — they were made on the condition that Apple would exclusively use Qualcomm's baseband chip sets in all its iPhones and iPads.""Baseband chip sets enable smartphones and tablets to connect to cellular networks for voice and data transmission.Qualcomm's actions are illegal under EU antitrust rules, Vestager said.IBD'S TAKE: For the latest news on chip stocks, visit IBD's news page Chip Stocks To Watch And Semiconductor Industry News.Qualcomm says it will appeal the European Commission's decision to the General Court of the European Union.""We are confident this agreement did not violate EU competition rules or adversely affect market competition or European consumers,"" Don Rosenberg, executive vice president and general counsel of Qualcomm, said in a statement.

It earned an adjusted $1.09 a share, up 24% year over year, on revenue of $3.75 billion, up 10%.""For the first time in several quarters TI delivered merely an in-line quarter and guide, which for investors used to beat-and-raises may set up for a healthy pause (given the 20% plus move since last quarter),"" Rosenblatt Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann said in a report. ""The notion that TI can grow the top line at 10%-plus levels organically, as was the case in 2017, is simply untenable. However, 5-7% growth is we think a sweet spot for TI in terms of sales growth given its powerful position in analog/embedded markets where they are gaining dollar share on a secular basis.""Mosesmann reiterated his buy rating on TI stock and upped his price target to 135 from 120.Texas Instruments stock received at least five price target increases on the news, as well as one decrease.Chipmaker Microsemi (MSCC) has been approached about a possible takeover and is exploring its options, Reuters reported.Microsemi has hired investment bank Qatalyst Partners to advise it on the best course of action, a source told Reuters.Aliso Viejo, Calif.-based Microsemi is a major supplier of semiconductors for aerospace, defense, communications and industrial applications.Microsemi stock climbed 1.8% to close at 63.44 on Wednesday.

119,QCOM,"Ford Motor (F) announced new partnerships in self-driving cars Tuesday and said it will develop an open-source, cloud-based platform for new mobility services.X The automaker is adding delivery service Postmates to existing partnerships with Domino's Pizza (DPZ) and Lyft , while it's teaming up with chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM) to ramp up work on smart, connected cars.The new partnerships come as Ford is gearing to ""test-drive"" a new self-driving business model this quarter in an as-yet unnamed city. The autonomous-vehicle business model will harness Ford's new open-source platform, called Transportation Mobility Cloud, and aims to help Ford's business partners expand into underserved areas, as well as allow Ford to support small and midsize businesses. Ford already tests self-driving cars in Pittsburgh and Detroit.""We can design transportation in our cities in ways that improve the quality for everyone at the same time,"" CEO Jim Hackett said in a keynote speech Tuesday morning at CES 2018 in Las Vegas.EVP Jim Farley added that Ford is building an all-new vehicle just for autonomous use. ""It puts us in a great position to scale quickly"" for the robotaxi business Ford plans to launch by 2021, Farley said.Hackett shared his vision for the future of urban mobility in Las Vegas — hours after Intel (INTC) unveiled its first self-driving car, part of a planned 100-car test fleet, and a day after Nvidia (NVDA) showed off its Xavier self-driving chip at CES.Mobileye, which was acquired by Intel last year, said 33 vehicles are already being manufactured and will ramp up to 100 by the end of the year.Intel announced Monday that China's SAIC Motors joins a growing roster of Mobileye's self-driving partners, which include Audi, BMW, Fiat Chrysler (FCAU), Honda (HMC) and Nissan (NSANY).Mobileye also reported it has design wins for advanced autonomous systems with 11 automakers who collectively represent more than 50% of the auto industry.

The company's investments in autonomous technologies include the acquisition of Argo AI, an artificial-intelligence firm; partnerships with four startups including lidar expert Velodyne; and the creation of a Silicon Valley campus.But since then, Ford's self-driving ambitions have been overshadowed by the perception that GM leads in the future of cars. GM in November said it will launch self-driving cars for ride-sharing services by 2019, describing the business as potentially raking in profits.Neither Ford nor GM has made explicit whether they will partner with ride-sharing companies such as Uber or Lyft on robotaxis or go it alone.MORE YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Nvidia Shares Break Out On Autonomous Car Deals, Can They Stay Up?CES Officially Starts; EV Stock Plays To Watch: Investing Action Plan

120,QCOM,"Wall Street is giving Qualcomm (QCOM) positive reviews for its business strategy as it defends itself from a hostile takeover attempt by fellow chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO).X Qualcomm received at least four price-target hikes and one stock rating upgrade after the company on Tuesday presented its plan for staying independent.Qualcomm shares slipped 0.3% to close at 68.02 on the stock market today. Earlier in the session, Qualcomm was up as much as 1% to 68.90. On Tuesday, Qualcomm jumped 4.4% to 68.25. It had been approaching a buy point of 69.38 in a 63-week cup-with-handle base.Nomura Instinet analyst Romit Shah upgraded Qualcomm stock to buy from neutral and raised his price target to 75 from 58.""Qualcomm leadership is very smart, but over the last several years, the San Diego-based management team at times has been unassertive and complacent,"" Shah said in a note to clients. ""Now with Broadcom's hostile takeover attempt analogous to a 'gun to the head,' we expect the company to more aggressively focus on driving shareholder value in order to remain a stand-alone franchise.""Potential drivers for the wireless-chip maker include closing its acquisition of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) and settling its legal disputes with customer Apple (AAPL), Shah said.Qualcomm on Tuesday raised its profit outlook and said it might use funds to buy back stock if its $38 billion bid to acquire NXP fails.""With tax reform, we are well-positioned to complete a large stock buyback that will deliver essentially the same level of accretion to Qualcomm stockholders as if we had closed NXP,"" Qualcomm Chief Financial Officer George Davis said in a webcast, according to Reuters. ""Our preference is to close NXP, but not at all costs.""IBD'S TAKE: Qualcomm has an IBD Composite Rating of 54 out of a possible 99. For more analysis on Qualcomm, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.Qualcomm forecast adjusted earnings per share of $6.75 to $7.50 in 2019 on revenue of $35 billion to $37 billion. Wall Street had been modeling for earnings of $3.79 on revenue of $23.59 billion. Qualcomm expects to achieve its new profit target through a $1 billion cost-reduction plan and by resolving current licensing disputes, including with Apple.""We are encouraged by the new $1 billion cost-reduction program,"" Canaccord Genuity analyst Michael Walkley said in a report. ""We also believe Qualcomm's acquisition of NXP remains on track and will create a company with significant earnings power and cash flow, developing into a clear industry leader in the mobile, Internet of Things, and automotive semiconductor markets backed by the extremely strong combined intellectual-property portfolio of Qualcomm, NXP and Freescale (Motorola).""Walkley reiterated his buy rating on Qualcomm and raised his price target to 86 from 83.In addition to Nomura and Canaccord, Qualcomm received stock-price-target increases from Macquarie and Mizuho Securities.Qualcomm management repeated its assertion that Broadcom's offer substantially undervalues Qualcomm. On Nov. 6, Broadcom offered to buy Qualcomm in a cash-and-stock deal worth $130 billion, including $25 billion of net debt.Qualcomm on Tuesday urged its investors to reject Broadcom's takeover proposal, which is being put to a shareholder vote for Qualcomm's March 6 annual meeting.In a statement Tuesday, Broadcom criticized Qualcomm's go-it-alone plan as a ""transparent attempt to sell a quick fix"" to its shareholders.Meanwhile, Broadcom reportedly is facing an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission into whether it engaged in anti-competitive tactics in negotiations with customers, the Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday.RELATED:Chip-Gear Stocks Rock On Upbeat ASML, Ichor Reports

122,QCOM,"Apple (AAPL) hit a record high Tuesday morning, looking at first glance like a market leader after reclaiming a buy point Friday. But Friday's move had some glaring weaknesses and by Tuesday's close Apple retreated to settle just under its entry area again.X Meanwhile, iPhone chipmakers such as Broadcom (AVGO), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), Qorvo (QRVO), which have been market laggards in the past several weeks, hit key resistance Tuesday. But Qualcomm (QCOM) made a big move.On Tuesday, Apple hit a record high of 179.39, but reversed with the market, closing down 0.5% to 176.19, back below the 176.34 flat-base buy point.Apple rose 1% to 177.09 on Friday, reclaiming the 173.64 entry. That wasn't an especially powerful price gain. Meanwhile, volume was 7% below normal. You want to see trading activity rise at least 40%-50% above average on breakouts and moves into buy zones.Apple's relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, is well off recent highs. (The RS line is the blue line in the stock charts below.) Friday's 1% stock move, not much more than the S&P 500's 0.7% advance, did little to change that. You want to see a stock's RS line lead or confirm a breakout or move into a buy area.Apple's RS line hasn't made headway since early May. Even when Apple briefly broke out on Dec. 18, the stock's RS line was off its prior highs.Can Apple's move into buy zone work? If the market continues to power ahead, then there's a good chance that Apple's stock will continue to climb. It's also possible that Apple will begin to outperform the S&P 500 significantly again.Investors should try to focus on stocks that will deliver the strongest gains, while minimizing the risk of losses, especially big losses.Apple reports earnings on Feb. 1.Broadcom is currently in a flat base with a 285.78 buy point. Broadcom sank 0.4% to 263.25 after finding resistance at its 50-day moving average. The RS line has fallen to its lowest levels since early July or early May. That reflects a series of flat bases on top of or next to each other without making much headway.IBD'S TAKE: With the market now in a confirmed rally for 100 days, it can be hard to see who are the true leading stocks and which are in the middle of the pack. See why IBD's relative strength line is so important.Qualcomm is an interesting case for two reasons.First, the wireless chip giant is in a royalties battle with key customer Apple, as well as related legal and regulatory challenges and probes around the world. Those woes helped send the stock crashing from October 2016 to last September.Second, Broadcom is making a now-hostile bid for Qualcomm, so the latter's shares skyrocketed in November. Since peaking in late November, Qualcomm and Broadcom shares have  generally moved in a similar fashion. Then again, so has Skyworks Solutions.But Qualcomm separated from Broadcom on Tuesday, climbing 4.4% to 68.25 as it laid out its case for staying independent, offering bullish 2019 targets.Qualcomm is in a huge cup-with-handle base. If you prefer, you can view the handle as a flat base on its own. Either way, the buy point would be 69.38. Shares closed Friday at 65.38, finding support at its fast-rising 50-day line.Qualcomm's RS line has lagged badly since late Nov. 24, reflecting the stock's underperformance over that time. But the RS did get a nice bounce Tuesday with shares rising and the major averages retreating.Skyworks Solutions is in a consolidation essentially next to two prior patterns that had short-lived breakouts. Skyworks has a 117.75 buy point. Shares closed Friday at 101.21, continuing to trade below its 50-day and 200-day line. The 50-day line last week fell below the 200-day, negative technical action known as a bearish cross.Meanwhile, the RS line peaked in early June and is now just off its lowest levels in a year.Skyworks found resistance at its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, reversing lower to close off 1.3% at 99.86.Qorvo, like Skyworks, is in a consolidation next to a pair of bases with breakouts that soon failed. It's also below its 50-day and 200-day moving averages. The RS line is right around the lowest levels in a year after peaking last May.Qorvo is in a consolidation with an 81.30 buy point, but has a lot of work to do. Qorvo sank 2.45% to 69.30 on Tuesday, finding resistance at its 200-day line.Analog Devices (ADI) and Integrated Device Technology (IDTI), both seen as iPhone X plays, are both in shallow, short cup bases. The RS lines are lagging, though a powerful stock gain could lift these stocks' RS lines above at least a short-term high from their recent pseudo-handles (they are not proper handles). Keep in mind that the RS lines have basically been flat for a year. Integrated Device's earnings have been spotty.Analog Devices rose 1.2% to 93.10, closing in on a 94.09 entry. Integrated Devices fell 1.7%.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:These 4 Top Tech Stocks With Strong RS Lines Hit Buy PointsA Stock Rises Again After Its First Breakout Fails; Should You Buy Again?Facebook Tumbles Below Buy Point; Why Breakout Was Never 'Meaningful'When Will You Know The Top Stocks' Big Runs Are Over?

123,QCOM,"Chip stocks are hoping for some much-needed good news in the week ahead as earnings season shifts into high gear.The week ahead will bring earnings reports from a bunch of closely watched chip companies, including Texas Instruments (TXN) on Tuesday, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Qualcomm (QCOM) on Wednesday, and Intel (INTC) on Thursday.The sector was knocked down over the past week by cautious reports from chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) and semiconductor-equipment supplier Lam Research (LRCX).Investors fret the chip sector has peaked and is starting to enter a down cycle, analysts say.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseTaiwan Semi, the world's largest contract chipmaker, added to those concerns on Thursday when it lowered its target for sales growth in the global semiconductor industry this year to 5%, down from its prior outlook for 5% to 7% growth.That day, the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index dropped 4.3%. It was the biggest one-day drop for the index, known as SOX, since Feb. 8 and only the 10th time in the past eight years when the index fell more than 4%.The iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (SOXX) fell 1.2% on the stock market today.The broad sell-off in the chip sector was not justified, Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill said in a report Friday. Taiwan Semi said the sales weakness was related mostly to the smartphone sector, particularly Apple (AAPL). The chipmaker said sector growth areas like automotive, Internet of Things and data centers remained strong, Gill said.Lam Research also rattled chip stocks when it gave a disappointing outlook late Tuesday for chip-gear shipments for the rest of the year. Fremont, Calif.-based Lam makes wafer fabrication equipment for the semiconductor industry.Bank of America Merrill Lynch on Friday said chip stocks could go 4% to 7% lower. Rough earnings, trade fights and market volatility have ""soured the mood,"" analyst Vivek Arya said in a report.Arya cut his price targets on chip stocks with heavy exposure to Apple's iPhone business, including Broadcom (AVGO), Cirrus Logic (CRUS) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS).Chip company earnings in the week ahead could decide if the sector rebounds or continues its downward trajectory.Dallas-based Texas Instruments is set to report first-quarter results after the market close Tuesday. Analysts expect TI to earn $1.11 a share, up 14% year over year. That's on sales of $3.65 billion, up 7%, in the March quarter.Analysts say Santa Clara, Calif.-based AMD should earn 9 cents a share, reversing a year-earlier loss of 4 cents a share. That's on sales of $1.57 billion, up 59%, in its fiscal first quarter.Wall Street expects San Diego-based Qualcomm to earn 70 cents a share, down 48%, on sales of $5.19 billion, down 13%, in its fiscal second quarter.A legal dispute with major customer Apple has dampened its results in recent quarters. Apple refuses to pay technology licensing fees to Qualcomm until the legal matter is resolved.Also weighing on Qualcomm is the possibility that China could block its proposed acquisition of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI). On Thursday, China's Ministry of Commerce gave a pessimistic preliminary review of the Qualcomm-NXP deal.Analysts see Santa Clara, Calif.-based Intel earning 72 cents a share, up 9%, on sales of $15.05 billion, up 2%, in the first quarter.RELATED:Qualcomm To Cut 1,500 Jobs To Help Stave Off Broadcom MergerIntel Stock Nears Buy Point After Price-Target HikeChip Stocks To Watch And Semiconductor Industry News

124,QCOM,"Facebook (FB) is building a team to design its own semiconductors, adding to a trend among technology companies to lower their dependence on chipmakers such as Intel (INTC) and Qualcomm (QCOM), sources say.XThe social media giant seeks a manager to build an ""end-to-end SoC/ASIC, firmware and driver development organization,"" according to a job listing on Facebook's website. It indicates the effort is still in its early stages.The Menlo Park, Calif.-based company would join other technology giants tackling the massive effort to develop chips. In 2010, Apple (AAPL) started shipping its own chips and now uses them across many of its major product lines. Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google has developed its own artificial intelligence chip as well.Facebook could use such chips to power hardware devices, artificial intelligence software and servers in its data centers. Next month, the company will launch the Oculus Go, a $200 stand-alone virtual reality headset that runs on a Qualcomm processor.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseFacebook also is working on a slew of smart speakers. Future generations of the devices could be improved by custom chip sets. By using its own processors, the company would have finer control over product development. It also would be able to better tune its software and hardware together.Facebook declined to comment on the job postings.A system on chip, or SOC, is a type of semiconductor that contains several discrete components built into one piece of silicon. They're typically used in mobile devices where their space and power-saving properties are more valuable. The main functions of most smartphones are provided by SOCs.An ASIC, or applications specific integrated circuit, is a chip designed for a narrow purpose. Such components are often the fastest or most-efficient at running a particular piece of software. But they're locked down and may become redundant over time if software and workloads evolve.The postings didn't make it clear what kind of use Facebook wants to put the chips to other than the broad umbrella of artificial intelligence. A job listing references ""expertise to build custom solutions targeted at multiple verticals including AI/ML,"" indicating that the chip work could focus on a processor for artificial intelligence tasks.Facebook AI researcher Yann LeCun tweeted about some of the job postings on Wednesday, asking for candidates interested in designing chips for AI.

Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBroadcom (AVGO) popped in extended trading after the chipmaker said it would buy back up to $12 billion of its stock. Broadcom has been struggling for months, with President Trump blocking its bid for fellow Apple iPhone chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM) on national security grounds. Beaten-down Qualcomm also was up overnight on fresh takeover buzz.But investors may want to take a look at Intel (INTC) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM). Both are consolidating well as the stock market rallies.Broadcom was not yet active Friday morning but jumped 4.2% in late trade. That would push the chipmaker above its 50-day moving average and closer to its 200-day line. Technically, the stock is in a consolidation going back to late November, but it hasn't really broken a downtrend.Shares fell late last year as Broadcom mounted a hostile takeover offer for Qualcomm. Both are Apple chipmakers. But the Trump administration blocked the deal on national security grounds, in part on fears that the penny-pinching Broadcom would cut R&D spending, imperiling the U.S. lead in wireless technology.As for Qualcomm, shares plunged after the Broadcom bid collapsed. The stock rose 2.7% in the premarket on a report that ex-Qualcomm Chairman Paul Jacobs is assembling a group to make a go-private takeover offer.Intel rose 3.2% to 52.72 on Thursday, the highest close since September 2000. The relative strength line is at a six-year high, signaling outperformance vs. the S&P 500. Intel still hasn't topped a 53.78 intraday high set on March 13. If the chip giant can consolidate below that level through Friday, it will finish a five-week flat base. That would give it a 53.88 entry.Intel tumbled on April 2 on a report that Apple is developing its own chips for Mac computers that would replace Intel processors. But the stock found support at the 50-day line and soon moved higher.As for Apple, the stock rose 1% to 174.14, rising a little further above its 50-day line. It's also working on a short consolidation. Its RS line is near recent highs, but hasn't made much progress for the past 11 months.Taiwan Semiconductor climbed 1.1% to 43.85 on Thursday, moving back above its 50-day moving average. The world's largest chip foundry, Taiwan Semi is in a consolidation with a 46.67 entry.The RS line is just below a record high.Taiwan Semi was briefly the world's most valuable chipmaker, but Intel has wrested the market crown in recent days.The chip foundry reports earnings on April 19.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:The Big Picture: Stocks Face This ResistanceData Storage Key Link In Emerging Data-Centered Computing CycleASML, Lam Research, Taiwan Semiconductor Kick Off Chip Earnings SeasonTrump's Shocking TPP Flip-Flop Reveals China Tariff Plan Is A DudStock Breakout Specialty Tool: The Relative Strength Line

126,QCOM,"Chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO) turned its unsolicited bid for Qualcomm (QCOM) into a hostile takeover attempt Monday by announcing plans to nominate its own slate to entirely replace Qualcomm's 11-member board of directors.X Broadcom's board and other proposals are expected to be put to a vote by shareholders at Qualcomm's 2018 annual meeting, scheduled for March 6.Broadcom said Qualcomm refuses to negotiate so it decided to take its offer directly to shareholders in a proxy fight.""Although we are taking this step, it remains our strong preference to engage in a constructive dialogue with Qualcomm,"" Broadcom Chief Executive Hock Tan said in a news release. ""We have repeatedly attempted to engage with Qualcomm, and despite stockholder and customer support for the transaction, Qualcomm has ignored those opportunities. The nominations give Qualcomm stockholders an opportunity to voice their disappointment with Qualcomm's directors and their refusal to engage in discussions with us.""In its own news release, Qualcomm on Monday acknowledged receipt of Broadcom's nomination of a slate of candidates to replace Qualcomm's existing board of directors. The San Diego-based company reiterated its go-it-alone strategy.""No company in the industry is better positioned than Qualcomm in mobile, IoT (internet of things), automotive, edge computing and networking and to lead the transition to 5G (wireless),"" Tom Horton, Qualcomm's presiding director, said in release. ""Qualcomm stockholders expect a board that will support this innovation while evaluating objectively the full range of opportunities available to maximize value for all Qualcomm stockholders.""Qualcomm criticized Broadcom's proposed acquisition and highlighted the many uncertainties associated with it, including regulatory hurdles and lack of committed financing.Broadcom shares lost 2.9% to close at 263.61 on the stock market today. Qualcomm dropped 1.4% to finish at 64.56.IBD'S TAKE: For the latest news on chip stocks, visit IBD's news page Chip Stocks To Watch And Semiconductor Industry News.Broadcom remains confident that it can clear any regulatory requirements needed to complete the deal, including satisfying antitrust authorities, Tan said.""In light of the significant value our proposal provides for Qualcomm stockholders, we believe Qualcomm stockholders would be better served by new independent, highly qualified nominees who are committed to maximizing value and acting in the best interests of Qualcomm stockholders,"" Tan said.Qualcomm on Nov. 13 rejected Broadcom's cash-and-stock offer, which at the time of the Nov. 6 bid was worth $130 billion, including $25 billion of net debt. Qualcomm said the offer undervalues the company. Under the proposed offer, Broadcom would pay $70 in cash and stock for each share of Qualcomm. The deal would consist of $60 in cash and $10 per share in Broadcom stock.RELATED:Is There A Buy Opportunity In These Sinking Chip-Gear Firms?Chipmaker Marvell Beats Third-Quarter Targets; Shares Climb

127,QCOM,"Smart speakers were hot sellers over the holiday season, especially Amazon.com's (AMZN) Echo devices, but they could be just the start of a much bigger trend toward connected homes.X And they're likely to be a major topic of conversation at the annual CES consumer electronics show in Las Vegas next week. Amazon Echo speakers with Alexa voice controls have made people comfortable with the notion of using their voice to turn on music or get weather reports and sports scores by speaking a question out loud.Now early adopters are wanting to control everything from door locks and garage door openers to thermostats and lighting with voice commands or by using their smartphone.""It really is the Trojan horse into the smart home,"" Marjorie Costello, editor and publisher of Consumer Electronics Online News, told Investor's Business Daily.Amazon's Echo Dot, which costs $49.99, has proved to be a ""gateway drug"" for people to get hooked on connected home technologies, she said.CES 2018 is likely to see many TVs, stereos and other devices that have voice controls and can be operated using smart home networks, Costello said.Numerous companies will be at CES showing off Wi-Fi connected devices that can link to home control networks backed by Amazon, Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google, Apple (AAPL) and others.Amazon was widely seen as a winner at CES 2017 by the way it worked to get Alexa controls into everything from refrigerators to robot vacuum cleaners. Amazon is looking to continue its dominance of CES at the 2018 show by sponsoring nine conference sessions with titles such as ""Amazon's Quest for Alexa to be Everywhere"" and ""Building a Smarter Home with Alexa."" Other sessions are focused on helping companies to incorporate Alexa technology into their products.CES officially kicks off on Tuesday in Las Vegas after two days of preshow activity. The four-day conference is expected to attract roughly 4,000 exhibitors and more than 170,000 attendees, including more than 7,000 members of the news media. The trade show will cover more than 2.5 million net square feet of exhibit space.In addition to connected home technologies, other devices expected to make waves at the 2018 show include self-driving cars, augmented reality glasses, 8K super-high-definition televisions, digital health gadgets and home robots.The event will feature keynote presentations from Intel (INTC) and Ford Motor (F), as well as big media briefings by Nvidia (NVDA), Qualcomm (QCOM), Sony (SNE), Samsung and other companies.CES 2018: See The Latest Technology Trends & Top Tech StocksCES 2018 could provide positive news for several publicly traded companies, including Control4 (CTRL) and Universal Display (OLED), Cowen analyst Robert Stone said in a note to clients Friday.Control4 is a leader in smart home technology and will be attending the show.

129,QCOM,"Broadcom (AVGO) stock turned negative on Thursday after initial enthusiasm dissipated over the company's better-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter results.Broadcom shares rose as much as 4.5% to 275.70 in morning trading on the stock market today. But in afternoon trading Broadcom stock turned south. At the close Thursday, Broadcom ended the trading day unchanged at 263.89.Late Wednesday, Broadcom reported adjusted earnings per share of $4.59, up 32% year over year, on sales of $4.84 billion, up 17%, in the quarter ended Oct. 29. Analysts expected earnings per share of $4.51 on sales of $4.82 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research.For its current quarter, Broadcom guided to adjusted earnings per share of $4.93, up 36% year over year, on sales of $5.3 billion, up 28%. Wall Street had been modeling Broadcom to earn $4.43 a share on sales of $4.82 billion, Zacks said.Broadcom also raised its quarterly cash dividend to $1.75 per share, up 72% from the prior quarter.

132,QCOM,"President Donald Trump late Tuesday released a list of $200 billion worth of Chinese goods subject to a 10% tariff, escalating the China trade war. Dow futures, along with S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures, fell sharply after hours. Dow Jones stocks Apple (AAPL), Boeing (BA) and Caterpillar (CAT) retreated, as well as Tesla (TSLA), NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) and other China-tied stocks.President Trump imposed tariffs of 25% on $34 billion in Chinese goods on Friday, with Beijing immediately retaliating on an equal amount of U.S. goods. The U.S. is set to roll out tariffs on $16 billion more in Chinese wares in a couple of weeks. Just before the U.S.-China trade war got underway, Trump said he was ready to impose tariffs on an additional $200 billion in Chinese goods, and more beyond that.The new tariffs could go into effect after Aug. 30, the U.S. Trade Representative's office said in a statement late Tuesday.The Dow Jones, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite rose modestly in Tuesday's stock market session. In late trading, Dow futures fell 1.1% vs. fair value. S&P 500 futures slid 1%. Nasdaq 100 futures retreated 1.2%.Apple stock fell 0.9%, Boeing stock 1.5% and Caterpillar 1.3%. The Dow Jones components are not subject to current tariffs but could be at risk from an escalating China trade war.Tesla, which announced plans for a Shanghai plant on Tuesday, sank 1.7%. NXP Semiconductors fell 1.9%. Chinese regulators have held up NXP's takeover by Qualcomm (QCOM).Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

133,QCOM,"Here is your Investing Action Plan for Friday: What you need to know as an investor for the coming day. The June jobs report, often a stock market mover, could take a back seat to big news of the day — possibly the first big shots in the China trade war as Trump tariffs are set to hit at the stroke of midnight.If the Trump tariffs do kick in at midnight Eastern Time, adding 25% to $34 billion worth of high-tech Chinese imports, Beijing is set to immediately retaliate — dollar for dollar — with tariffs on U.S. autos and agriculture.Stocks have fallen in recent weeks on Trump trade war fears. So it's unclear how the major averages and key sectors will react if the China tariffs go into effect, or not.But the broader implications are huge. If the tariffs take effect, then the U.S. will be at the outset of a technological cold war with Beijing from which there may be no turning back. If they're off the table or on hold, then Wall Street will heave a sigh of relief, knowing that Trump's trade threats will prove to be mostly bark, not bite.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseChina right now is set to slap a further 25% tariff on U.S.-built cars and SUVs. That will hit Ford (F), Tesla (TSLA) and others. Germany's Daimler (DDAIF) already warned that profits on Alabama-built SUVs will suffer. Chinese tariffs on U.S. agriculture, including soybeans, would indirectly hit Deere (DE), which thrives when American farmers rake in profits.LED maker Cree will be among the U.S. companies hit by the Trump tariffs after the Trump administration turned down its request for an exemption. Cree (CREE) warned that the tariffs would limit its R&D spending and planned manufacturing expansion.Trump tariffs hitting U.S. semiconductor makers will come in the next batch of $16 billion worth of goods targeted. Those tariffs still face a final review, but their likelihood will rise markedly if the first round of tariffs takes effect.Beyond tariffs, U.S. multinationals could face other significant hurdles in China. Beijing could make life difficult for Dow Jones stocks Boeing (BA), Caterpillar (CAT) and Apple (AAPL). China has been holding up the Qualcomm (QCOM) takeover of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI).Economists expect the June employment report to show the U.S. added 190,000 jobs last month as the unemployment rate held at 3.8%. The Labor Department report is due out at 8:30 a.m. ET.Average hourly earnings is the big number to watch. Expect annual wage growth to tick up to 2.8%. That would match the best pay gain since 2009.Costco (COST) boosted its starting wage by $1 and other wages by 25-50 cents an hour effective June 11. That followed wage hikes earlier this year by Target (TGT), Walmart (WMT), CVS Health (CVS), Kroger (KR) and more.Rising wage growth would offer more evidence that the historical link between lower unemployment and higher pay is still intact. Higher wages, in turn, are expected to fuel higher inflation. Any upside surprise in wages will boost odds of a third and fourth Fed hike this year, as long as rising trade war fears don't curb economic enthusiasm.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:As Trump Tariffs Hit, The U.S. Is Losing The China Trade War — Big TimeThese Auto Stocks Rev Higher; Is Trump Tariffs 'Ploy' Working?Breakout Watch: IBD 50 List Stock With 171% Growth Stock Market Today: Track Market Trends And The Best Stocks To WatchChart Reading For Beginners: Discover The 3 Most Profitable Chart Patterns

134,QCOM,"Dow futures rose solidly Thursday morning, along with S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures. But the stock market is under pressure on Trump trade war concerns. U.S.-China fireworks begin Friday. A pair of sectors at high risk from a Trump trade war have been big losers. That includes Dow Jones industrials such as Boeing (BA) and Caterpillar (CAT), as well as automakers. Chipmakers slumping, with Intel (INTC), Nvidia (NVDA) and Micron Technology (MU) stocks all failed breakouts. Apple (AAPL) stock also coming under pressure, with its heavy exposure to China.Dow futures rose 0.7% vs. fair value. S&P 500 futures climbed 0.6%. Nasdaq 100 futures were 0.6% higher.The Federal Reserve will release minutes from its June meeting at 2 p.m. ET. At that meeting, policymakers raised rates and signaled two more Fed rate hikes are likely this year, one more than previously expected. Investors will be looking to see how hawkish Fed members really are.Also Thursday: the ADP employment report will estimate June private-sector hiring, the Labor Department will release weekly jobless claims and ISM will issue its June nonmanufacturing index. Those all lead up to Labor's June employment report on Friday.But the big news Friday: President Trump is due to impose tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese goods, mostly tech and telecom products. China says it will immediately retaliate, dollar for dollar.In Tuesday's half-day session before the 4th of July holiday, the major stock market averages opened higher but reversed lower. Nasdaq composite fell 0.9%, but closed above its 50-day moving average. The S&P 500 index slid 0.5%, once again sinking below its 50-day line. The Dow Jones industrial average retreated 0.55% after rising intraday above its 200-day line.Micron stock triggered Tuesday's sell-off. A Chinese court barred Micron Technology from selling chips in the country, siding with Taiwan chipmaker United Microelectronics (UMC) in a patent fight. Rightly or wrong, investors took that Micron ruling as part of the U.S.-China trade war. China has been holding up approval of the Qualcomm (QCOM)-NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) deal until the U.S. lifts harsh sanctions on China telecom gear giant ZTE.In any case, Micron stock fell 5.5% Tuesday. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index retreated 1.8%, moving back below its 200-day line. Micron was indicated lower again Thursday.Chip stocks have been conspicuous laggards even as the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite hit new highs in June. Even Intel stock, Nvidia stock and Micron stock, which were outperforming the chip sector, have fallen well below buy points and their 50-day moving averages.U.S.-China trade war tariffs won't target semiconductors much at first. But the U.S. is wary of China of buying cutting-edge tech as Beijing seeks dominance via Made in China 2025. Beijing could continue to make life difficult for U.S. chipmakers working in China via regulatory hurdles. Longer term, the trend is toward a U.S.-China cold trade war in technology that would roil complex supply chains and cut off markets.China is a huge and growing market for Boeing jets. China could favor Airbus (EADSY) over Boeing in a trade war. Boeing was the top Dow Jones stock in 2017. Boeing stock recently triggered a sell signal and is trading below its buy point.Another Dow Jones component, Caterpillar stock, has fallen below its 50-day and 200-day lines.General Motors (GM) and Ford (F) reported solid U.S. sales Tuesday. But GM stock, Ford stock and their global peers are struggling as Trump threatens a global auto import tariff. That would trigger retaliation and raise supply chain costs as even U.S.-made cars and trucks tend to have high non-U.S. content.Apple, another Dow Jones stock, is also vulnerable to a prolonged U.S.-China trade war. China is a big market for the Apple iPhone and various services. Most Apple iPhones are made in China. A trade war could hit iPhone suppliers, China could hold up exports and threaten any number of actions to hinder Apple.Apple stock blasted out of a buy zone in a sharp rally from the end of April to early May. Strong earnings helped, fueled by fast-growing high-margin services as iPhone sales were so-so A huge buyback and Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) buying more Apple stock also were big Apple stock drivers.But in recent weeks, Apple stock has been fading. It's now just modestly above a buy point. Shares are fighting for support at 50-day, closing just below that level Tuesday.So far stocks have largely retreated on trade war fears, even as hopes remain that the actual damage will be minimal. But on Friday, President Trump is open hostilities with tariffs on an initial $34 billion of Chinese goods. China has vowed to retaliate. Tariffs are slated to hit a further $16 billion in Chinese products soon.Trump has threatened tariffs on another $200 billion in Chinese goods, and then a further $200 billion.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:The Big Picture: Stocks Face This TestTrump China Tariff Decision Will Be Yuuuge For StocksThese 4 Top Stocks Have One Thing In Common  IBD Stock Of The Day Tests Buy Point After 19% Run

But if the restrictions are severe, they would have a high impact on chip vendors, it said. Many electronics products are assembled in China, including Apple's iPhone.Trade restrictions will have low-to-medium impact on U.S. semiconductor-equipment vendors, Moody's said.Chip companies with the most sales exposure to China include Skyworks and Qualcomm (QCOM), CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino said in a report.""We still view the lingering trade issues with China as the biggest risk to the semiconductor industry and expect chipmakers to remain pressured near term until better clarity on the situation is realized,"" Zino said.RELATED:Market Sell-Off Accelerates; This Top Chinese Stock Hits Key Support LevelNasdaq Leads Stocks Lower As U.S. Amps Up Trade Threats; Netflix Dives

136,QCOM,"President Donald Trump's imminent decision on whether to hit China with tariffs starting Friday could easily make this the best or worst week of the year for the stock market. The implications of the Trump China tariff decision are that big: Either we're at the outset of a technological cold war with Beijing, or — more likely — Trump's trade threats will prove to be mostly bark, not bite.The big Wall Street fear is that the Trump China tariff decision won't just trigger retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods, but will provoke Beijing to find additional ways to hinder U.S. multinationals like Boeing (BA), Caterpillar (CAT) and Apple (AAPL) in Chinese markets. Beijing has already held the merger of Qualcomm (QCOM) with NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) hostage.The Dow Jones industrial average — which includes Apple, Boeing and Caterpillar — opened solidly lower on the stock market today, but rallied to close slightly higher. The Dow Jones remained just below its 200-day moving average after undercutting that key support last week. The S&P 500 index rose Monday after undercutting its 50-day line once again intraday. The Nasdaq composite led with a 0.8% gain.But if the Trump China tariff threat is put to rest — or at least put on hold — the relief could be palpable. In a Sunday note, Morgan Stanley warned that President Trump is likely to follow through on his tariff threats.""We no longer doubt that the U.S. administration's proposals signal the direction of trade policy.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""An escalatory cycle of protectionist actions, not just rhetoric, has begun and will continue,"" wrote Michael Zezas, chief strategist for U.S. public policy at Morgan Stanley.Growing alarm over Trump trade policy should give way to a major relief rally if the president calls a cease-fire with China this week.Trump is set to hit Beijing with 25% tariffs on $34 billion worth of mostly tech-related imports on Friday, July 6. The same day, China is ready to hit back — dollar for dollar — with tariffs aimed primarily at autos and agriculture. Chinese imports from Ford and Tesla would be hit with an extra 25% tariff, more than reversing Beijing's cut in auto import tariffs from 25% to 15%, effective July 1. Daimler has already warned that it expects Chinese tariffs on its Alabama-built Mercedes-Benz SUV to hit sales and profits.Here's why the deadline is so important: Trump has already bent over backward to appease Beijing. If the two sides can't make enough progress toward a trade cease-fire this week to avert the imposition of tariffs, then a deal will become even less likely as threats turn to outright hostilities, which may quickly escalate. The U.S. has tariffs on another $16 billion worth of goods from China, including semiconductors, nearly ready to go, and China is ready to retaliate. Beyond that, Trump has directed trade officials to draw up tariffs on another $200 billion worth of Chinese imports.But there's good reason to expect a deal, or at least a delay in the Trump China tariff deadline. If Trump really intended to launch a China trade war, he probably wouldn't have gone to bat to save 70,000 Chinese tech jobs.First, he pledged to reverse sanctions that had forced Chinese communications gear firm ZTE out of business, pushing back against a Senate move to reject a lesser punishment. Then, last week, Trump dropped a plan for emergency China investment and export rules, including a 25% limit on Chinese ownership in firms buying key technology. Trump instead took a less combative tack, backing legislation in Congress to strengthen the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS.Reading between the lines — and threats — Trump has already made pretty clear that he wants a trade deal, not a China trade war, and he came close to reaching one in May that would have had Beijing buy an additional $70 billion in U.S. goods. Even though it would have done relatively little to narrow the trade deficit with China, Trump touted the emerging deal, tweeting that China would ""buy massive amounts of ADDITIONAL Farm/Agricultural products"" from the U.S.China appears open to such a deal, if it can avert tariffs and trade restrictions that jeopardize its ""Made in China 2025"" strategy. Signs of an economic slowdown in China and financial fragility only raise the importance of a trade cease-fire.If Trump reaches an accord with China, Wall Street may begin to relax about Trump's threat to hit U.S. auto imports with tax of 20% to 25%. The European Union has reportedly threatened to retaliate with tariffs on $300 billion worth of imports from the U.S., the equivalent of a full-scale trade war. But General Motors (GM), Toyota (TM) and other automakers have warned that Trump's plan could sink U.S. auto sales by 2 million vehicles a year and deliver a hit to manufacturing employment. Like Trump's threat to launch a full-scale trade war against Beijing, a big tax on auto imports looks so potentially disruptive to world trade that it may begin to be seen as lacking credibility.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Trade War Fireworks Burn These 2 SectorsRetail, Energy Among Top Stock Plays As Sector Rotation OccursStock Market Today: Track Market Trends And The Best Stocks To WatchChart Reading For Beginners: Discover The 3 Most Profitable Chart Patterns

137,QCOM,"Just how bad will the U.S.' slap-fight over trade, which escalated with China on Friday, be for S&P 500 earnings and stocks? Just how much can the U.S. economy, which delivered solid June jobs growth on Friday, still grow after a nine-year expansion?Analysts expect another blowout quarter in Q2 — 20.7% earnings-per-share growth for S&P 500 index components and an 8.1% jump in revenue, according to Thomson Reuters. Wall Street is betting on continued scorching results for the rest of the year. But they may not be as scorching if President Donald Trump's trade wars with China, Canada, Mexico, Europe and others become more heated. The quiet earnings growth next year might be even more muted.Analysts say the effects of a trade war have yet to be priced into financial forecasts.""I think the first tangible impact should start showing up in estimate revisions as these earnings results come out,"" said Sheraz Mian, director of research at Zacks.In other words, the second-quarter earnings season could offer some higher drama than CEOs' usual blanched remarks about ""headwinds"" and ""tailwinds."" Investors, even more than usual, will focus on earnings guidance and post-earnings call commentary to get some answers as to how the tariffs will affect profit, sales, prices, corporate strategy and shareholder returns.Higher costs for parts and supplies that U.S. companies bring in from overseas could mean higher costs for customers. Businesses could rethink or even uproot complex global supply chains. Higher prices on U.S.-made goods sold overseas could crimp international demand. Companies could cut or delay major investments.S&P 500 index companies, filled with hundreds of U.S. multinationals and exporters, are more exposed to tariffs and global demand than the U.S. economy itself.As for the second-quarter itself, the gains from S&P 500 companies come courtesy of President Trump's tax cuts and an enduring U.S. economy.Rebounding oil prices will lift the energy sector's Q2 earnings by around 141.5%, with sales up some 20%, according to Thomson. S&P 500 energy stocks, which include Dow Jones giants Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) as well as ConocoPhillips (COP), Valero (VLO), Marathon Oil (MRO), Schlumberger (SLB) and many others, have generally been strong performers.Analysts expect the S&P 500 financials to clock a 22% gain in earnings on a 4.5% bump in revenue, as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and other banks enjoy lower taxes and deregulation. Thomson forecasts semiconductors and internet software and services to lead the S&P 500 tech components toward 25.5% earnings growth. Tech revenue is seen jumping 12%. Apple (AAPL), Intel (INTC), Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Facebook (FB) are all slated to deliver solid-to-stellar growth.As estimates stand now, Thomson Reuters is forecasting the 20%-plus earnings growth to reach into the third and fourth quarters.""The last time we had earnings growth in Q3 and Q4 like this was in 2010,"" Tajinder Dhillon, senior research analyst at Thomson Reuters, said in an email.However, looking past 2018, analysts appear to have a harder time justifying bullish expectations for S&P 500 companies.""You look at the numbers going forward, you really don't start to see a significant drop in growth until you get into 2019, when again, you'll be back to apples-to-apples on the tax rates,"" said John Butters, senior earnings analyst at FactSet.But tougher comparisons aren't a massive concern right now, analysts say. And next year's growth still looks solid. Dhillon said that for 2019 investors can expect a 9.7% earnings growth rate, ""which is still higher than the 20-year average of 7.3%.""Wall Street also worries that the U.S. economy has fewer tools at its disposal to keep its marathon run going. The dollar is stronger. The yield curve is flatter due partly to the Federal Reserve's decisions to lift short-term interest rates.The narrowing yield curve, the gap between rates on short-term and long-term government debt, looms large for banks in particular. The flatter curve, also seen as a precursor to an economic downturn, has dragged bank stocks lower in recent months.Banks also lend money to borrowers based on long-term rates, but borrow from depositors according to short-term rates. The narrower the difference between the two, the narrower the banks' net interest margins. JPMorgan, Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC) report second-quarter earnings on Friday.The three banking giants, which all announced hefty shareholder-return packages last month, are expected to deliver solid EPS growth. But JPMorgan stock, along with that of Citigroup, Wells Fargo and others, is near 2018 lows.When the Fed raises rates that affects the money flowing into global, emerging markets as well.""If U.S. interest rates are going up,"" Mian said, ""and an investor or a class of investors is scouring world markets for yield and returns, and if the yield and return is going up in a developed market like the U.S., then there's no reason to take the extra risk of going to Argentina or Turkey when you can get it in the U.S.""The U.S. on Friday lobbed tariffs at $34 billion worth of Chinese products — more than 800 types of products total. That's the first part of a $50 billion response for what Trump says are China's trade abuses against the U.S.The U.S. tariffs target aircraft parts, industrial parts and equipment, some vehicles and other machinery. The duties from the U.S. targeted products related to China's tech-focused ""Made in China 2025"" plan. Trump has said that initiative would ""hurt economic growth for the United States and many other countries.""""The United States can no longer tolerate losing our technology and intellectual property through unfair economic practices,"" Trump said in a statement last month.China on Friday responded with penalties of its own on U.S. products, including automakers and agriculture. China aimed those tariffs squarely at Trump's base.Trump has threatened to levy another $200 billion in tariffs on China, and even more. Meanwhile, Trump has threatened to impose a global import tariff on autos. That follows duties on steel and aluminum that have spurred Europe, Canada and Mexico to retaliate.Further trade discord could force companies to rethink their supply chains. Those adjustments could undo corporate America's efforts over the past two decades to more efficiently manage their inventories. Such practices over that time firmed up businesses' balance sheets.The brinkmanship has swept up some of the most iconic American businesses along the way. General Motors (GM) said as much last week, warning that more tariffs would lead to ""reduced presence at home and abroad for this iconic American company.""Harley-Davidson (HOG) said it would offer more detail, on its earnings call this month, about its plans to move some production out of the U.S. to skirt tariffs from the EU. Brown-Forman (BFB) is raising the price of Jack Daniel's in parts of Europe because of the tariffs imposed by the EU.No one knows how the Trump trade wars, and their impact on S&P 500 companies, will play out.""We expect company-specific risks from tariffs and China-trade exposures to be a central discussion topic during 2Q18 earnings calls,"" RBC analyst Deane Dray, who covers industrials vulnerable to steel and aluminum tariffs, wrote in a note last month. ""But no one has a crystal ball on how the tariff situation will ultimately play out, especially the potential knock-on effects.""He said companies like 3M (MMM) and Danaher (DHR) looked best equipped among industrials to handle the trade disputes.The trade war also threatens chipmakers like Micron (MU). A Chinese court blocked sales of some of its chips in the country, a move seen as pushback from the nation against Trump's trade salvos. China has held up approving the Qualcomm (QCOM) takeover of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI). Boeing (BA) isn't subject to China tariffs, but Beijing could favor Airbus (EADSY) jets in a protracted U.S.-China trade war. The aerospace company in April downplayed worries over a trade war.Baird analyst Benjamin Hartford covers transportation and logistics companies like UPS (UPS), FedEx (FDX) and Expeditors International (EXPD). Hartford wrote in a research note last month that he'd seen no ""material evidence (yet) of freight volume weakness amid rising global trade tensions.""Some analysts, like Tigress' Ivan Feinseth, expressed optimism that strength in corporate earnings would offset any trade damage. Others wonder how much a trade war will hurt corporate travel for the likes of global carriers like American Airlines (AAL) and Delta Air Lines (DAL), and cargo demand broadly. Delta Air earnings are due Thursday.""We still expect demand to grow, but those expectations are dampened with each new tariff introduced,"" Alexandre de Juniac, CEO of the International Air Transport Association, said of air cargo demand in a statement this week.

138,QCOM,"Chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO) is expected to see a lift to its sales and earnings from Apple's (AAPL) iPhone X production ramp when it reports fiscal fourth-quarter results after the market close Wednesday.X Analysts expect Broadcom to earn $4.50 a share, up 30% year over year, on sales of $4.82 billion, up 16%, in the October quarter, according to Zacks Investment Research. For the current quarter, Broadcom's fiscal first, Wall Street is modeling the company to earn $4.40 a share, up 21%, on sales of $4.82 billion, up 17%.Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Christopher Rolland on Tuesday reiterated his positive rating on Broadcom stock and raised his price target to 325 from 300.Broadcom could see modest upside to its current-quarter guidance thanks to Apple's improved production of its flagship iPhone X smartphone, Rolland said.

144,QCOM,"Telecom companies dashed the hopes of investors betting on a frenzy of mergers and acquisitions last year, but Broadcom's (AVGO) pursuit of Qualcomm (QCOM) and Walt Disney's (DIS) deal with 21st Century Fox (FOXA) have primed the pump for 2018 M&A in semiconductors and media.Wall Street analysts say 2018 is shaping up a bigger year for mergers and acquisitions, amid slower activity since the 2015 boom.One reason is the expected cut in corporate taxes, including lower levies on overseas cash brought into the U.S. For private equity firms and others that structure deals using high-yield debt the good news is that deductions on interest expenses are still allowed, though capped.Some companies may target deals that optimize corporate structure around new tax policies, says investment bank Goldman Sachs. Others may take the common M&A routes of gaining scale and cutting costs or expanding into new markets.""All the right ingredients are in place,"" said Marc Suidan, a partner and tech sector leader in PricewaterhouseCooper's M&A advisory practice. ""Tax clarity could bring some money onshore, facilitating some transactions. A lot of big tech companies have ample cash in any event. And, strategically companies are making big bets on emerging technologies.""PwC says tech companies will aim to acquire startups in artificial intelligence, augmented reality, and the Internet of Things, a system of web-connected devices.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.Startups' easy access to venture capital funding, though, has made it hard for tech giants to gobble up hot private companies.Another reason for slower M&A in 2017 was public company valuations. Targeted companies were leery of all-stock acquisition proposals, analysts say, fearing a possible market correction.Goldman Sachs analysts are among those expecting a rebound in 2018 after M&A activity dipped in late 2016 and 2017. Republicans pushed through lower corporate tax rates, which may free up cash for deal making.""Reduced policy uncertainty should increase the fundamental incentive for corporate acquisitions,"" a Goldman Sachs report said.Companies that could be involved in M&A in 2018 include Twitter (TWTR), Twillio (TWLO), Cornerstone OnDemand (CSOD), Hortonworks (HDP), Lumentum Holdings (LITE) and Acacia Communications (ACIA), the investment bank said.Of course, even if a sector looks ripe for consolidation, merger talks can fizzle out. Telecom investors bid up shares of T-Mobile US (TMUS), Sprint (S), Dish Network (DISH) and Charter Communications (CHTR) on takeover speculation in 2017 only to be disappointed.T-Mobile and Sprint shelved their merger talks in November. And cable TV firm Charter remains independent despite rumored suitors such as Verizon Communications (VZ), Japan's SoftBank, Altice US (ATUS) and Comcast (CMCSA).Here's a snapshot of sectors and companies to watch in 2018:Media. In the wake of Disney gobbling up much of 21st Century Fox, more media deals are expected. Discovery Communications (DISCA) and Scripps are already betrothed. Some analysts speculate that CBS (CBS) will be next to find a mate. RBC Capital sees a potential match in CBS and Lions Gate Entertainment (LGF).The Trump administration has sued to block AT&T's (T) purchase of Time Warner (TWX), creating uncertainty over antitrust policy. A federal judge may not rule on the case until late spring 2018. While Comcast dropped out of the bidding for Fox assets, the cable TV firm is unlikely to stay on the sidelines.FANG (Facebook (FB), Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google) companies. Amazon, after acquiring Whole Foods to boost its retail distribution, could turn its attention to entertainment assets, some analysts speculate. Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) acquired part of HTC's smartphone business in 2017 but the internet giant hasn't made a major acquisition since smart device maker Nest Labs in 2014.Google's cloud computing business might benefit from acquiring a large software company, but most analysts doubt that will happen. Google instead partnered with Salesforce.com (CRM) last year. Facebook, meanwhile, is likely to remain focused on small deals in artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies.Semiconductors. Broadcom's hostile bid for Qualcomm is shaping up as an epic battle. One wild card: whether Qualcomm can first close its purchase of automotive chipmaker NXP Semiconductors (NXPI). Elliott Advisors, an activist hedge fund, is pressuring Qualcomm to up its offer.Nvidia (NVDA), though cash-rich, has shied away from big deals.  Xilinx (XLNX), though, makes a good fit for Nvidia, KeyBanc Capital speculates.  Either Nvidia or Xilinx, meanwhile, could make an offer for Ambarella (AMBA), analysts say.Romit Shah, an analyst at Nomura Instinet, says a M&A wave among midcap stocks is possible in 2018. ""The sweet spot, in our opinion, is companies in the $1 billion to $15 billion market cap range,"" he said in a report. ""These companies include Dialog Semiconductor (DLG), Diodes (DIOD), Macom Technology (MTSI), Maxim Integrated (MXIM), MaxLinear (MXL), and Microsemi (MSCC).""Payments. Vantiv (VNTV) acquired U.K.-based Worldpay in July, marking the sector's biggest 2017 deal. There's speculation that PayPal Holdings (PYPL), with $6 billion in cash, could target Europe's Adyen. James Faucette, a Morgan Stanley analyst, says the pace of M&A picked up in the payments industry in 2017. ""We see no signs of the trend abating especially as tax reform could help efficient cash repatriation and make funds available for deployment (i.e. PayPal),"" he said in a report.Software. A tax holiday on overseas profits brought to the U.S. should give Microsoft (MSFT) and Oracle (ORCL) more cash to make acquisitions. Other companies with ample cash on their balance sheets include VMware (VMW), Adobe Systems (ADBE),  ServiceNow (NOW), Red Hat (RHT) and security firm Palo Alto Networks (PANW). For many buyers, the focus is expected to be on fast-growing software-as-a-service companies. The customers of SaaS vendors purchase renewable subscriptions, rather than one-time, perpetual software licenses.Cloud computing data centers. The sector has been busy with Digital Realty (DLR) buying DuPont Fabros and Equinix (EQIX) acquiring data centers from Verizon.  Equinix continued its buying spree in late December, purchasing Australia's Metronode. Europe-based InterXion Holding (INXN) could be targeted, says Oppenheimer.RELATED:Wall Street Analysts Identify Top Chip Takeover Targets For 2018These Stunning Stats Reveal Epic Netflix-Amazon-Hulu-Apple War To Come2018 Stock Market Outlook: What To Watch For In The New Year

145,QCOM,"Chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO) is considering raising its takeover bid for Qualcomm (QCOM) to avoid a proxy battle, Reuters reported late Wednesday.Qualcomm rejected Broadcom's unsolicited bid on Nov. 13, saying it undervalued the company. Broadcom offered to pay $70 in cash and stock for each share of Qualcomm. The deal would consist of $60 in cash and $10 per share in Broadcom shares.After consulting with several of Qualcomm's top shareholders, Broadcom is considering sweetening the deal by offering more of its stock, sources told Reuters.Qualcomm's shareholders indicated to Broadcom they expect at least $80 per share for Qualcomm to be sold, Reuters said.IBD'S TAKE: Broadcom stock has a best-possible IBD Composite Rating of 99.

146,QCOM,"Broadcom (AVGO) isn't planning to increase its $105 billion offer for Qualcomm (QCOM) ahead of a proposal next week to replace directors on its board, according to people familiar with the matter.X An increase in Broadcom's $70-a-share offer isn't likely until closer to Qualcomm's board meeting in March, said the people, who asked not to be identified. Broadcom plans to nominate directors to Qualcomm's board ahead of a Dec. 8 deadline, the people said.For now, Broadcom and its tough-negotiating Chief Executive Hock Tan will lean on a direct appeal to Qualcomm's shareholders in an effort to pull off the biggest acquisition in the history of technology. It's a first step in an attempt to put more pressure on Tan's target to come to the table or force Qualcomm's management and board to explain to shareholders why the company, the biggest maker of mobile phone chips, is better off going solo.Broadcom feels there is strong support for the merger from Qualcomm's shareholders and is still hoping for friendly engagement, one of the people said. The timing of any improved offer isn't definitive and could change, the people cautioned.Broadcom shares fell 2.3% to close at 271.56 on Friday. Qualcomm lost 1.3% to finish at 65.49.The current Qualcomm board rejected the $70-a-share offer. Investors have said they would sell if the offer was increased by at least $10 a share.Broadcom, which has said it would prefer friendly negotiations, may be holding off on offering more until Qualcomm's ongoing acquisition of NXP Semiconductors NV is resolved. That $47 billion deal is being held up by regulators. When clearance is received — as early as by the end of the year according to people familiar with that matter — Qualcomm will then have to persuade the Dutch company's shareholders to tender 80% of their holdings. The stock is currently trading above the offer price, implying they expect a raise.San Diego-based Qualcomm declined to comment and a Broadcom representative didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.The transaction is the latest in Tan's push to reshape the semiconductor industry. He wants Qualcomm's industry-leading phone chip technology to add to his growing collection of ""franchises"" — technology capabilities that he believes are becoming increasingly important to makers of electronics.Qualcomm is being pursued as it's surrounded on all sides by challenges that have eroded its market value. The company is embroiled in a bitter legal battle with Apple (AAPL) over phone technology patent fees that the iPhone maker refuses to pay. That and regulatory actions around the world threaten its lucrative licensing business.Executives at Qualcomm have argued that the Apple fight is merely a commercial negotiation that will eventually be settled, turning back on the flow of billions of dollars of royalties.Broadcom's stock price has surged under Tan's leadership as the company has successfully pulled off a string of acquisitions. Wall Street has generally applauded Tan's vision, pushing up his company's shares more than 1,600% since 2009. He typically buys companies and then focuses on their core competencies while jettisoning expansionary projects and reducing the costs associated with them.Buying Qualcomm would make Broadcom the third-largest chipmaker, behind Intel (INTC) and Samsung Electronics. The combined business would instantly become the default provider of a set of components needed to build each of the more than one billion smartphones sold globally every year. The deal would dwarf Dell Technologies' (DVMT) $67 billion acquisition of EMC in 2015 — then the biggest in the technology industry.If Qualcomm's management and board continue to fight Broadcom, they will have to convince investors that their plans to parlay the company's dominant position in phone chips into entrees for components in servers, personal computers and cars will pay off quickly.

165,QCOM,"The type of base that a stock forms can tell you a lot about what is going on with the company.X Long cup bases may signal periods of transition or rethinking. Flat bases say ""don't change that dial."" Double bottoms often show a stock wrestling with a transition in institutional ownership as the market is struggling.High, tight flag bases clearly make this statement: ""We're up-and-coming.""This vertical-looking pattern forms as a stock surges 100% to 120% in four to eight weeks. The stock then corrects just 10% to 25% in price for only three to five weeks. The ideal buy point is the high of the flag plus 10 cents.The base is counterintuitive, because an investor's tendency is to buy low and sell high. But in a high, tight flag, a stock is seeing a queue of traders ready to buy high and sell even higher. The base shows just a small portion of investors taking profit; others are impatient to press ahead.Get IBD's Market Prep And Tech Report Newsletters — For Free!The bases have acted as early launching pads for leaders including Qualcomm (QCOM), JDS Uniphase, Taser International (TASR) and, almost exactly a century ago, Bethlehem Steel. Keep in mind, though, that successful flag patterns are rare.They often form in the second half of a huge rally by a stock. Breakouts by Mellanox Technologies (MLNX) (its initial gain was shy of 100%) in June 2012 and Tesla Motors (TSLA) in July 2013 offer a couple of examples of this.And, like any base, breakouts from high, tight flags don't always succeed. It's worth repeating this point: Good flags are rare. A breakout by NQ Mobile (NQ) rose in only three of six weeks following its September 2013 breakout. It then dived 87% in nine months. Today, the stock is trading near 2 a share.Another volatile, but much more successful, example was Emulex late in 1999.  This was just before technology and internet stocks tanked in early 2000, and long before Avago Technologies, which is now Broadcom (AVGO), acquired the data network connectivity specialist for $606 million in May 2015.The high, tight flag occurred late in Emulex' 21-month advance. The stock cleared an area of tight trade in late August 1999 and ran up 107% from 43.25 to 89.50 in just five weeks. That was the flagpole.Shares corrected for three weeks, easing back but never even coming close to testing support at the 10-week moving average. The buy point was 89.60, cleared on Oct. 4 in volume surging 65% above its 50-day average. Emulex soared 118% in less than six weeks before action grew volatile, including a huge reversal on Jan. 3, 2000.The stock then succumbed to the dot-com crash, which was dragging down the general market from the Nasdaq composite's peak on March 10.By April 14, 2000, Emulex round-tripped all of its gains.(A version of this column was first published on March 29, 2016.

168,QCOM,"Chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO) on Monday officially launched an unsolicited bid to acquire wireless-chip maker Qualcomm (QCOM) in a deal worth $130 billion, which would make it the largest technology company acquisition ever.XQualcomm reportedly is poised to reject the bid, believing it undervalues the company. In a written statement, Qualcomm said it is reviewing the bid and will make a decision that is in the best interests of its shareholders.Under the proposed offer, Broadcom would pay $70 in cash and stock for each share of Qualcomm. The deal would consist of $60 in cash and $10 per share in Broadcom shares. Broadcom's proposal represents a 28% premium over the closing price of Qualcomm stock on Thursday, the last unaffected trading day prior to media speculation regarding a potential transaction. The proposed transaction value of $130 billion includes $25 billion of net debt.Bloomberg reported Friday that Broadcom was consulting advisors about the possible megadeal.Broadcom said its proposal stands whether Qualcomm's pending acquisition of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) is completed at the currently disclosed terms of $110 per NXP share or the transaction is terminated.""This complementary transaction will position the combined company as a global communications leader with an impressive portfolio of technologies and products,"" Broadcom Chief Executive Hock Tan said in a statement. ""With greater scale and broader product diversification, the combined company will be positioned to deliver more advanced semiconductor solutions for our global customers and drive enhanced stockholder value.""Qualcomm has a rich portfolio of cellular communications patents and technologies, including key technology for 5G wireless services.IBD'S TAKE: Chip-company mergers and acquisitions are heating up. Marvell Technology reportedly is interested in buying Cavium, according to a report Friday.If combined, Broadcom and Qualcomm, including NXP, would have pro forma fiscal 2017 revenues of about $51 billion and pro forma 2017 EBITDA — earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization — of about $23 billion, including synergies, Broadcom said.Singapore-based Broadcom announced last week that it intends to move its headquarters to the U.S., an action that could make it easier for the company to buy U.S. companies.Broadcom has been active in mergers and acquisitions, completing five major deals since 2013. It is in the process of buying Brocade Communications Systems (BRCD) for $5.9 billion.A Broadcom acquisition of Qualcomm faces major hurdles. In addition to Qualcomm's resistance, the deal must pass muster with antitrust regulators.Broadcom stock fell 1.4% to close at 277.52 on the stock market today. Qualcomm was up 1.2% to finish at 62.52. NXP was up 1.5% to 116.72.Broadcom likely floated the idea of acquiring Qualcomm to mutual customers like Apple (AAPL) and Samsung before making a bid, BMO Capital Markets analyst Tim Long said in a report.""Broadcom management comments about 'confidence that our common global customers would embrace the proposed combination' could mean that the company has had discussions with large OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) like Apple and Samsung,"" Long said.The Broadcom-Qualcomm deal could be tough to pull off, given the history of proposed chip deals that failed, B. Riley analyst Craig Ellis said in a report.""Further, we see three areas of potential market concentration risk,"" Ellis said. ""As such, regulatory and business disposition risks appear relatively high in our view.""The proposed merger will probably face antitrust scrutiny in the areas of smartphone connectivity, radio-frequency chips, and ethernet chips, Ellis said.KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst John Vinh said the Broadcom-Qualcomm merger makes sense.The deal would provide significant cost synergies and the opportunity for Broadcom to leverage its healthy relationship with Apple to mend the current legal disputes between Qualcomm and Apple, he said.Qualcomm's board of directors is likely to reject the initial bid from Broadcom as too low, Canaccord Genuity analyst Michael Walkley said in a report.Still, the combination of the two companies could generate strong synergies and create a dominant wireless business and overall powerful global-semiconductor leader, Walkley said.""Qualcomm and Broadcom are uniquely positioned for reaccelerating revenue and earnings growth as the market transitions to 5G"" wireless standards, Walkley said. ""We believe Qualcomm is well ahead of its competitors in 5G investment and overall roadmap.""RELATED:Chip Winners Identified In Apple iPhone X TeardownsQualcomm Delivers Better-Than-Expected Fourth-Quarter Results

169,QCOM,"November has been a month of merger talk. Chipmaker Marvell Technology (MRVL) agreed to buy rival Cavium (CAVM) Monday for roughly $6 billion. Broadcom (AVGO) has tried to acquire fellow wireless chip giant Qualcomm (QCOM) for $130 billion, which would make it the largest tech takeover ever. Hasbro (HAS) has bid for rival toy maker Mattel (MAT). The media and telecom industries are basically in a speed-dating frenzy, with 21st Century Fox (FOXA) reportedly attracting many suitors for key assets.XWhy now? No one unifying catalyst appears to be behind the chatter or loosening the taps to facilitate the flow of deals. And M&A is on track to reach its lowest point in seven years.Still, while every company and industry has its own problems, cash, broadly, has not been not one of them.Companies across the S&P 500 Industrials — S&P 500 index members excluding financial, utilities and transportation companies — were sitting on a record $1.5 trillion in cash or cash equivalents in the second quarter. That cash hoard likely hit another all-time high in the third quarter, said Howard Silverblatt, a senior analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.""All the tools are there for M&A. The tools are there, the ability is there, the economy continues on,"" he said, adding: ""And every company has a list of other ones that they want to buy.""A mountain of cash also makes a company more attractive to investor holding groups, he said.But as GOP tax reform makes its way through Congress, nothing in the legislation pointed directly to a more M&A-friendly environment, he said. Despite the reports of corporate courtship, the numbers also don't exactly show any dramatic uptick in merger activity from years and quarters past.The tally of announced deals in the U.S. this year is on track to be at around 16,000. That would be the lowest since 2010, Richard Peterson, a principal analyst at S&P Global Market Intelligence, notes.Peterson said that buyers might be worried about stretched valuations. He added that foreign purchases of U.S. businesses have slowed, and that souring sentiment on weaker industries like retail and automobiles could be making big private-equity deals look less attractive.""With robust deal activity in recent years, buyers may be may finding it's taking longer to assimilate acquisitions into operations,"" he added.So far this year, some $1.2 trillion in deals have been announced, potentially down from around $1.65 trillion last year and nearly $2 trillion in 2015, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. The total value of deals announced so far this quarter was at $287.5 billion, well below the roughly $521 billion announced during the quarter a year ago. Deals announced in the third quarter of this year amounted to $322.5 billion.And amid an economic recovery that, for many over recent years, has still like a recession, big companies have tried to snap up smaller ones because there have been fewer avenues to grow sales to Wall Street's liking.Consider the striking contrast between deals struck before the financial crisis and after. Since 2010, companies announced more than 140,000 deals, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence data. From 2000 to 2007, in the run-up to the financial crisis, there were around 77,000.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.Some of the merger talks have also come in industries that have faced technological upheaval in recent years.Comcast (CMCSA), Disney (DIS) and Verizon (VZ), have set their sights on 21st Century Fox in one way or another, while AT&T has struggled to win approval for its planned acquisition of Time Warner (TWX). The FCC has voted to ease rules surrounding media ownership, potentially making future tie-ups easier. But the cable industry is also dealing with cord-cutting. Questions remain about whether Disney can throw enough ""Star Wars"" movies and streaming content at analysts to keep them from fretting over ESPN.Meanwhile, Marvell's chip business has struggled. Apple (AAPL) may or may not keep putting Qualcomm chips in its iPhones, and the two companies have been tangled up in a patent dispute. Meanwhile, Hasbro snagged Mattel's license for Disney (DIS) toys last year, while Mattel suspended its dividend in October.At least if more companies decide to continue to get together, the cash will be there.""It all makes the stakes higher,"" Silverblatt said. ""If everybody has money, that means more people can get into the game.""Marvell jumped 6.4% in the stock market today, while Cavium leapt 10.8%.

170,QCOM,"Futures for the S&P 500 index fell slightly Monday morning, recouping most of its overnight losses from German coalition talks breaking down. Meanwhile, Marvell Technology (MRVL) reached a deal to buy fellow Cavium (CAVM) for about $6 billion as chip takeover buzz has heated up with Broadcom (AVGO) making a $130 billion overture to Qualcomm (QCOM).XS&P 500 futures lost 0.1% vs. fair value after retreating 0.3% or more overnight. Germany's Dax erased a 0.5% loss to trade 0.2% higher.Month-long talks on forming a new German government collapsed Sunday night, as the Free Democratic Party walked out. Merkel's Christian Democrat Party, along with Bavarian CSU sistery party, were trying to form a coalition with the Free Democrats and the Green Party.Merkel could try to form another grand coalition with the Social Democratic Party, but SPD leaders say they aren't interested in continuing to be the junior partner.Marvell Technology will pay $40 in cash plus 2.1757 Marvell shares per Cavium share, the companies announced Monday morning. That is currently worth $84.15 a share. Cavium shares rose 7% to 81.15. Marvell was unchanged at 20.29.The Marvell-Cavium deal come as Broadcom recently offered $130 billion for fellow wireless chipmaker Qualcomm. Qualcomm has rejected the offer as undervaluing the company.

171,QCOM,"Stock futures edged higher early Wednesday morning after Democrat Doug Jones won Alabama's special election Tuesday, reducing the GOP's already-narrow Senate majority. Meanwhile, investors are looking ahead to the Federal Reserve's 2018 outlook and an expected interest-rate hike Wednesday afternoon.X Alabama is normally a deep-red state, but accusations of sexual misconduct involving teens hurt Republican Roy Moore.Tuesday's vote will complicate President Trump's agenda by cutting the GOP Senate majority to just 51-49. However, Jones likely won't take office for a few weeks, giving Republicans some time to pass tax cuts with the current 52-48 split.Details of the evolving GOP tax-cut plan appeared after Tuesday's close. Meanwhile, the Fed is virtually assured of raising rates at 2 p.m. ET, but the question is how many hikes that policymakers will forecast for 2018.S&P 500 index futures rose 0.1% vs. fair value after briefly falling following the Alabama election results. Dow and Nasdaq 100 futures advanced about 0.15%.Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) is close to carving out a flat base. But Apple chip plays are not faring as well, with Broadcom (AVGO) undercutting its buy point Tuesday, joining Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), Applied Materials (AMAT), Analog Devices (ADI) and Qorvo (QRVO) below the 50-day line as chipmakers continue to slump.The GOP tax plan being hashed out between the House and Senate now has a 21% corporate tax cut, down from the current 35%, but up from prior  plans for 20%. There would be a 37% personal income rate and the mortgage interest deduction would  be capped at $750,000, down from the current $1 million but above the House's $500,000.Apple shares fell 0.6% to 171.70 in Tuesday's stock market trading, but they're still holding support slightly above the 50-day moving average.Apple appears to be headed toward a flat base, which needs a minimum of five weeks. That would occur at the end of this week. This hypothetical bullish consolidation, with a potential buy point of 176.34, would be a base-on-base formation above a prior cup-with-handle pattern.Apple is investing $390 million in Finisar (FNSR) to help the optical components maker revamp a Texas plant to make key iPhone chips. Finisar shot up in premarket trading on Wednesday's news.Apple, a member of the Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow industrials, has shaken off iPhone X supply concerns.But such worries may be affecting key iPhone-related chip plays, which are also struggling due to general weakness in semiconductors.Broadcom had been one of the stronger Apple chipmakers, holding above its 259.46 buy point for the most part since the late-October breakout, becoming somewhat extended in late November.Broadcom, which is mounting a now-hostile bid for fellow wireless-chip giant Qualcomm (QCOM), reported strong earnings and guidance as well as a big dividend hike last week.Shares popped intraday Dec. 7 on the report, but closed flat. In the last three sessions, shares tested their buy point and 50-day moving average, finally closing below both levels with Tuesday's 0.4% loss to 258.81.Because Broadcom wiped out a 10% gain from its buy point, that entry is now invalid. A strong, high-volume retaking of the 50-day line could present a new buying opportunity.The chip-equipment giant is not a direct Apple supplier, though it's been deemed an iPhone X play for its work with OLED screens.Applied Materials fell 2.2% to 50.47 on Tuesday, continuing to hold below its 50-day moving average.In fact, just one of the 22 largest chip-gear stocks by market cap is current above that key support line, Kulicke & Soffa (KLIC). That's despite the record chip-gear sales in 2017 and 2018 seen by industry group SEMI.Among top chipmakers, Intel (INTC) and Texas Instruments (TXN) are slightly above their 50-day lines, but not many others are, outside of M&A-related plays.Analog Devices successfully broke out in late September/early October, unlike many other Apple suppliers. Shares rose more than 9% above an 85.81 buy point by Nov. 20. But shares then reversed lower on the company's latest earnings report and soon undercut their 50-day line.In recent sessions, Analog Devices has been holding just above or below the 85.81 entry, which is technically still valid. Shares fell 0.4% to 85.48 on Tuesday.Skyworks broke out in late October and Qorvo in early November, with both rising for a few sessions but then quickly tumbling through their buy points and 50-day lines.Skyworks fell 0.5% to 96.47 on Tuesday, about 18% off its high. Qorvo lost 1.3% to 67.70, hitting a four-month low intraday.RELATED:The Big Picture: This Key Tech Sector Shows Unusual Weakness5 Truck Stocks Set Up Buy Points Despite Tesla Semi: Investing Action PlanBullish Chart Patterns: Do You Know The Basics Of A Cup With Handle?Bullish Chart Patterns II: How To Find The Exact Buy Point

He said Broadcom is committed to its dividend strategy even with its bid to acquire Qualcomm.Qualcomm's rejection of Broadcom's offer sets the stage for a proxy battle that will be decided by shareholders, Daryanani said in a report Monday.""In a proxy fight we believe the debate would be: Can Qualcomm management that has overseen severe underperformance and been unable to resolve key disputes turn the ship or do shareholders put faith in Hock and take the exit? At the right price ($80?) we think investors would choose the Broadcom option,"" Daryanani said. He maintained his outperform rating on Qualcomm with a price target of 70.Qualcomm's recent performance has been hindered by a legal dispute with major customer Apple (AAPL) over patent royalty terms.Canaccord Genuity analyst Michael Walkley reiterated his buy rating on Qualcomm and raised his price target to 83 from 76, based on the expectation for a higher buyout price.RELATED:Broadcom Offers To Buy Qualcomm For $130 Billion In Largest Tech Deal Ever

179,QCOM,"With a bullish quarterly report and guidance from Apple (AAPL), your stocks to watch this week are five iPhone suppliers or related plays: Broadcom Limited (AVGO), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), Texas Instruments (TXN), Applied Materials (AMAT), Qorvo (QRVO) and Qualcomm (QCOM).Apple cleared a cup-with-handle buy point of 160.97 on Oct. 27, days ahead of its quarterly report. With Apple up 2.6% to an all-time high Friday, shares are now extended from the 5% buy range.After a wild session Thursday, Broadcom is trading back above a 259.46 buy point initially cleared on Oct. 30. Friday's 5.4% gain puts shares at an all time high, with Broadcom just above the 5% buy range.Broadcom said Thursday morning that October-quarter revenue will be at the higher end of its range. On Friday, shares rallied on Apple's earnings as well as a report that Broadcom may make a bid for wireless chip giant Qualcomm (QCOM), which has been feuding with Apple and many countries around the world over its licensing agreements. Qualcomm leapt 13% to 61.81 Friday, its best level since January.Skyworks Solutions cleared a cup buy point of 110.71 on Oct. 30, and holding within its buy zone. Skyworks, which issues its quarterly results on Monday, seems to be hitting some resistance around the 114 price level.IBD'S TAKE: Apple is on a hot streak. For a look at other high-quality growth stocks at or near buying opportunities, make sure to check out Leaderboard.Applied Materials broke out of a cup-with-handle base with a 47.69 buy point in September, and is now extended 18.6% from that level. When a stock becomes 20% extended from a buy point, that's usually a good time to take at least partial profits.Applied Materials, a chip- and display-equipment maker, is not an Apple supplier. But it should benefit from the use of OLED screens by Apple (in the Phone X) and other top manufacturers.Meanwhile, Texas Instruments is extended 16% from a cup-with-handle buy point of 84.34. The stock has been on a steady climb since clearing that level in heavy volume on Sept. 15.Qorvo tried to clear a 76.57 buy point from a sloppy cup-with-handle base this past week, but never closed above that level.

182,QCOM,"An early burst of upside energy devolved into broad-based losses Tuesday, despite a positive reading on inflation, in a session at least partly upended by White House politics.The Nasdaq Composite dropped 1%, while the Dow Jones industrial average slipped 0.7% and the S&P 500 took a 0.6% loss.Stocks rose for the first half-hour of trade Tuesday, then backtracked aggressively with Qualcomm (QCOM) spearheading the sell-off among tech names, as General Electric (GE) spiraled to the bottom of the Dow and as health care groups posted three of the day's five worst losses among the 197 industries tracked by IBD.February consumer price data released before the open was in line with forecasts, easing inflation concerns. The Trump Administration's order blocking an attempted takeover of Qualcomm by Singapore based Broadcom (AVGO) sent Qualcomm sprawling and Broadcom down 0.5%. The news initially sent Intel (INTC) up 4%, but gains fizzled to 0.2% by the close. News reports Friday said Intel was considering a takeover of Broadcom, in order to avert the competitive threat of a Broadcom/Qualcomm combination.It is difficult to tell how prominent other events in Washington were in investors minds Tuesday. The White House's sudden, though not unexpected, replacement of Rex Tillerson with Mike Pompeo as Secretary of State, the break between GOP and Democrats in the House Intelligence Panel's release of findings in its Russia probe, and the Senate's progress toward Dodd-Frank banking oversight reforms may all have weighed on the stock market today.The result showed the Dow clearly stymied at its 50-day moving average, while the S&P 500 again met resistance at the 2800 level and the Nasdaq pulled back to test support at the level of its recent high, from Jan. 26.On the Dow, General Electric dived more than 4% after JPMorgan slashed its price target, with Microsoft (MSFT) and American Express (AXP) each booking losses of more than 2%.Among medical stocks, hospital operators Community Health System (CYH) and software developer Tabula Rasa Healthcare (TRHC) each skidded 7% lower. Still, insurer UnitedHealth (UNH) rose 2% to lead the Dow after naming Andrew Witty, GlaxoSmithKline's (GSK) former chief executive, to head Optum health-services — the company's pharmacy benefits manager.  The positioning of a high-profile CEO to head the company stirred speculation that UntiedHealth could be considering a spin off.

Silicon Motion (SIMO) and Cavium (CAVM) dived more than 4% each.Fang stocks took one on the muzzle, with Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) falling more than 2%, and Facebook (FB) and Netflix (NFLX) off more than 1% each. Apple (AAPL) briefly scored a new high during the session, only to reverse course and end with a 1.1% loss.It's often not a good sign for markets when defensive plays such as utilities show strength, and PG&E (PCG) took the top spot among S&P 500 stocks, rising more than 7% in above-average trade. Xerox (XRX) and Alaska Air Group (ALK) were close behind, however, rising 6% and 4%, respectively. So the market's tone was not predominantly defensive.On the upside, IBD 50 stock LGI Homes (LGIH) jumped more than 4% in soft trade. The gain left shares 21% above an early march low as the homebuilder continues to rebound from support at its 40-week moving average.

183,QCOM,"The Nasdaq commanded the upside in the U.S. stock market at midday Thursday, rising 0.7%, while the No. 1 industry group among the 197 rated each day by IBD flourished on a fresh breakout by former big market winner First Solar (FSLR).X First Solar rushed more than 7% higher to 68.36 in volume running more than double its usual level. First Solar traded on average 2.5 million shares each day over the past 50 sessions.  The big gain extended a breakout from a new buy point in a massive first-stage cup with handle at 62.67. The 5% chase zone goes up to 65.80. The RS line (painted in blue on IBD charts) shot into new high ground.Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) is trying to join the Thursday rebound, rising 0.4% and trying to halt a mild three-day slide. However, as seen on a weekly chart, the iPhone, iPad and digital services marketer is doing just fine, appearing to find support near its still-rising 10-week moving average.Apple, despite being down nearly 1% for the week, still holds a 5% gain past a 160.97 buy point in a shallow second-stage cup with handle and is thus extended in price. And the megacap tech turnaround is still up more than 40% since clearing a first-stage cup with handle at 118.12, starting on Jan. 6.IBD's proprietary ratings for the megacap tech continue to rise. According to IBD Stock Checkup, the 90 Composite Rating is solid on a scale of 1 to 99, especially given that in January, Apple posed as a potential corporate turnaround. In fiscal 2016, ended in September that year, Apple's earnings fell 10% to $8.31 a share and revenue dipped 8%, ending years of vibrant growth.But Apple is back on track with accelerating increases in the rate of top and bottom-line growth.Earnings per share have risen 2%, 11%, 18% and 24% vs. year-ago levels in the past four quarters through fiscal Q4, ended in September this year. And in the December-ending first quarter of FY 2018, the Street sees earnings rising 12% to $3.77 a share.For all of FY 2018, expect profit to jump 24% to $11.44 a share on a 20% bump up in revenue to $274.26 billion. Strong digital services revenue and the emerging iPhone replacement cycle are helping to paint a bullish fundamental picture for the largest company in the U.S. stock exchanges (currently now at $870 billion).At 12:30 p.m. ET, the Nasdaq 100 is up for a third day in a row, rising 0.5%. The Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500 edged roughly 0.3% to 0.4% higher, weighed down a bit by declines in certain retail and defensive shares.Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) surged nearly 9% to 1,835 in fast turnover, extending its gain from a Nov. 22 breakout at 985.10 to 86%. The ETF produced a deep yet symmetrical cup with handle after sinking fast in early September.As seen in an IBD chart, the 55% drop from head to toe within the 11-week base is much deeper than the ideal range of 12% to 33%. However, Bitcoin Investment regained its 50-day moving average with relative ease, produced a fine downward-sloping handle in light trading in November, then broke out in furious volume.One could decide to sell the ETF for a profit when it undercuts the short-term 10-day moving average significantly. The 50-day moving average, currently near 932, is not helpful as a technical indicator at this point as it sorely lags the price of this highflying ETF.Semiconductor shares continued to rebound in the wake of good quarterly results of Broadcom (AVGO), which also raised its quarterly dividend by nearly 75%. Broadcom, which is attempting a hostile takeover of fellow semiconductor design giant Qualcomm (QCOM), notched a 32% rise in earnings to $4.59 a share in the October-ended fiscal fourth quarter as revenue climbed 17% to $4.84 billion. That's on top of a 38% EPS gain and a merger-fueled 125% top-line leap in the year-ago quarter.Nvidia (NVDA), whose chipsets allow Bitcoin mining, rallied more than 1% to 192.54 and is on a potential path to rebounding back above the rising 50-day average.Nvidia's CEO Jen-Hsun Huang said during a Q3 conference call that while the revenues currently being derived from Bitcoin activities are small, they're ""not zero."" While the Bitcoin-related revenue does not yet compare with the other major markets addressed by the leader in GPUs (graphics processing units) including AI, datacenter, and self-driving cars, Huang seemed to hold a positive long-term outlook for Bitcoin growth.Nvidia is currently ranked No. 13 in the IBD 50. The stock had advanced 25% after a Sept. 15 breakout from a narrow flat base at 174.66. The flat base is one of at least seven key chart patterns that every growth stock investor should know and master to catch excellent stocks at the right time.Going back to First Solar, the utility-scale solar power infrastructure expert had initially broken out of a bottoming base pattern with a 20% gap up on Oct. 27, sending shares hurdling over a 53.10 entry.On that breakout day of Oct. 27, First Solar posted its best quarterly results in eight quarters with earnings vaulting 64% to $1.95 a share on a 60% revenue boost to $1.09 billion. In the year-ago quarter, both earnings and revenue had fallen sharply. Solar companies tend to show extreme boom and bust cycles in their fundamentals.The bottoming base began back in March 2016, when the alternative energy play peaked at 74.29, then slid all the way down to 25.56, flushing out droves of shareholders in a 65.6% correction and setting the base count to zero.But in April this year, First Solar began to rebound and formed the right side of its gigantic cup base before forming a handle from late September to mid-October. That relatively quiet action helped form a handle and created the 53.10 initial buy point.Notice how in the weekly chart below, First Solar posted numerous big up weeks in heavy weekly turnover. That's a telltale signs of institutional investors, including pensions, insurers, banks, mutual funds and large investment advisers, accumulating shares and supporting the stock.Also note that in a first-stage base after a major decline, you want to see the stock to get back above its 50- and 200-day moving average lines. That's exactly what happened with First Solar.Going to the weekly chart of First Solar, and one can spot a 3-weeks-tight pattern, allowing for a secondary buy point at 63.20, or 10 cents above the highest price within the pattern. First Solar moved less than 1% in price during the weeks ended Nov. 24 and Dec. 1. That's very tight weekly action following a four-week 29% rally that began in mid-October.The 3-weeks-tight pattern allows an investor to add a small amount of shares to a winning position in a stock.While First Solar, due in large part to its renewed relative strength, harbors a solid 94 Composite Rating on IBD Stock Checkup, earnings are expected to decline both in 2017 (down 51% to $2.45 a share) and next year (down 40% to $1.47).The Energy-Solar industry group currently ranks No. 1 in IBD's daily rankings for six-month relative price performance.(You can trade the IBD 50 with one vehicle, the IBD 50 (FFTY) ETF, managed by Innovator Capital Management.

184,QCOM,"Futures for the S&P 500 index were essentially flat early Tuesday morning, while Dow industrials continued to outperform and Nasdaq 100 futures pulled back.X For a second straight session, the S&P 500 dipped Monday as top techs such as chip stocks such as Nvidia (NVDA), Micron Technology (MU), ASML (ASML), Applied Materials (AMAT) and Lam Research (LRCX) crashing through key support in recent days, with the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index tumbling through its 50-day line on Monday.Losses by chips and leading techs such as Facebook (FB), Adobe Systems (ADBE) and Microsoft (MSFT) offset gains by financials, retailers, transports and media companies.It's hard for the market to advance without the chip sector. Not only are key parts of the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 index, but they are involved in so many other tech fields. Nvidia is a great example with its graphics chips and cards expanding from PC gaming fields to autonomous driving, artificial intelligence and even Bitcoin mining.S&P 500 index futures were just a fraction above fair value. Dow industrial futures climbed 0.3% after blue chips added 0.2% in Monday's stock market trading. Nasdaq 100 futures sank 0.3% after the composite closed down 1.1%.Nvidia tried to retake its 50-day moving average on Monday, but reversed hard to close down 5.6% to 186.66, nearly 15% off its Nov. 20 peak.The recent heavy-volume retreat suggests investors may consider taking profits in the highflier. The stock is still slightly extended from a 174.66 buy point, but don't let a 10%+ gain turn into nothing or a loss.Nvidia fell 0.9% in premarket trading.Micron Technology has fallen for six straight sessions, starting when Morgan Stanley predicted that memory chip prices will fall. Micron fell below its 50-day line last Thursday and found resistance at the level the past two sessions.Micron edged lower early Tuesday.Chip-equipment makers ASML, Applied Materials and Lam Research plunged through their 50-day moving averages in heavy volume on Nov. 29, flashing clear sell signals. The chip-equipment makers have continued to fall since then.ASML and Lam Research edged lower in early trading, while Applied Materials was not yet active.ASML, Applied Materials and Lam Research have the biggest market caps among IBD's chip-equipment group. The eight largest chip-gear firms are all below their 50-day lines.Not every chip stock is in freefall.Intel (INTC), the world's largest chipmaker and a Dow component, has pulled back modestly in recent weeks, but remains above its 50-day moving average. Intel has expanded from chips for the PC market to data centers and, greatly aided by its Mobileye acquisition, targeting the automotive market.Broadcom (AVGO) also has pulled back, testing a recent buy point on Monday before rebounding somewhat. But it's in better health than most. The Apple (AAPL) chip supplier turned its unsolicited Qualcomm (QCOM) bid into a hostile effort, nominating directors to replace Qualcomm's entire board.RELATED:The Big Picture: Nasdaq Slumps As Leaders Hammered AgainFacebook, Nvidia Lead 5 Top Stocks Failing Test At This Key Support LevelStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksTechs Fall As Tax Reform Favors These IndustriesChip Stocks To Watch And Semiconductor Industry News

185,QCOM,"One day after Singapore-based Broadcom (AVGO) announced plans to move its headquarters to the U.S., a news report circulated that the chipmaker wants to buy San Diego-based Qualcomm (QCOM) in a deal that would create a semiconductor powerhouse.Bloomberg said Friday that Broadcom is consulting advisors about the possible megadeal. Broadcom has a market capitalization of about $117 billion, while Qualcomm has a market cap of roughly $92 billion.Broadcom stock rose 5.5% to 273.63 on the stock market today. Qualcomm jumped 12.7% to 61.81.Broadcom is rumored to be putting together a cash-and-stock bid worth $70 a share for Qualcomm, Bloomberg said.Broadcom has a history of deal making, including its merger with Avago Technologies, completed in January 2016. Broadcom currently is in the process of buying Brocade Communications Systems (BRCD).Broadcom first announced plans to buy Brocade last November in a $5.9 billion deal. But the companies have been tied up by regulatory reviews.Broadcom's decision to move its headquarters to the U.S. could positively affect the Broadcom-Brocade deal, analysts say.IBD'S TAKE: Broadcom has an IBD Composite Rating of 98, meaning it has outperformed 98% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months. For more analysis of Broadcom and its peers, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.Last month, Broadcom pushed back the closing deadline because of a review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, the government agency that reviews national security implications of proposed foreign investments in U.S. companies. Broadcom and Brocade now expect the deal to close by Nov. 30.Qualcomm has been hobbled by a legal fight with major customer Apple (AAPL) over patent licensing fees and terms. It also has run into problems trying to close its pending $47 billion purchase of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI). That deal is facing regulatory scrutiny in Europe and opposition from some NXP shareholders who argue that the offer undervalues NXP.NXP shares fell 2.1% to 115.02 on Friday as investors weighed the possible impact of a Broadcom bid for Qualcomm.Broadcom's headquarters move is designed to boost its merger prospects, Jefferies analyst Mark Lipacis said in a report Friday.""We think the decision is rooted in the company's strategy to pursue M&A as a means to drive free cash flow, earnings per share and shareholder value, and in the political reality that it has become more difficult for overseas-based companies to acquire U.S. ones,"" Lipacis said. ""We would not be surprised to see Broadcom continue to pursue large acquisitions, consistent with our thesis that the industry will continue to consolidate, and see an upward bias on gross and operating margins.""RELATED:Now There Are 2 Big Chip Takeover Offers Seen By Monday: Marvell-Cavium And Broadcom-QualcommQualcomm Delivers Better-Than-Expected Fourth-Quarter Results

186,QCOM,"After a steady ascent all day, the stock market closed higher and near session highs Friday, as news of a possible buyout of Qualcomm (QCOM) helped the Nasdaq lead the market.XThe Nasdaq led with a 0.7% increase, thanks largely to Apple's (AAPL) 2.5% jump following the company's earnings report.Also, Qualcomm — still one of the largest Nasdaq components — soared 13% in tremendous volume after Bloomberg reported that Broadcom (AVGO) is considering an acquisition of the company. The deal would create a giant in the chip industry.The S&P 500 climbed 0.3% and the small-cap Russell 2000 eased 0.1%. The Dow utilities average climbed 0.3%, extending a rebound from a Sept. 28 low. The Dow Jones industrial average added 0.1%. The Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500 all closed at record highs.Dow component Home Depot (HD) bounced from Thursday's slide by rising 1% after finding support at the 50-day moving average. Housing-related stocks tumbled Thursday on news that a tax reform bill would limit deductions for mortgages.Volume fell from Thursday's levels, according to unconfirmed numbers. But breadth was weaker than the indexes would suggest. Decliners led advancers by 15-to-14 on the NYSE and losers edged winners on the Nasdaq.The networking industry group led after Arista Networks (ANET) surged 11% on results that beat expectations. Health care was another productive sector, with biotechs, generic drugs and medical products among the top 10 industry groups Friday.Oil stocks also were high on the performance table. U.S. oil prices rose $1.14 to $55.68 a barrel and are trading at the highest since July 2015.A number of stocks broke out past buy points after reporting quarterly results.Hortonworks (HDP) surged past the 17.80 buy point of a flat base in heavy volume. The data management software company reversed higher after erasing early losses.Carbonite (CARB) topped the 24.70 buy point of a saucerlike pattern, but shares of the data-storage company closed below the entry. TriNet Group (TNET) gapped up and broke out of a 41.68 buy point, but also closed below the entry.RELATED:Broadcom Exploring Qualcomm Acquisition: ReportArista Networks Answers Pre-Earnings Sell-Off With Big Beat

187,QCOM,"Qorvo (QRVO) stock fell Thursday after the chipmaker issued disappointing December-quarter guidance late Wednesday, dropping as much as 4.4% in intraday trading. Qorvo shares dipped 0.2% to close at 74.30 on the stock market today.Two Wall Street firms downgraded Qorvo shares to neutral from buy after it reported earnings. Craig Hallum lowered its rating on Qorvo to hold from buy and cut its price target to 71 from 78.

It expects to earn an adjusted $1.60 a share on sales of $840 million in the December quarter, based on the midpoint of its guidance. Analysts expected $1.74 and $897 million.Cowen analyst Karl Ackerman called Qorvo's report a ""mixed bag."" The company's guidance was disappointing, but its long-term demand drivers remain unchanged, he said in a report.Qorvo's shortfall in the December-quarter was likely related to major customer Apple (AAPL), which has been slow to ramp up production of its flagship iPhone X.""The revenue outlook for the December-quarter came in $50 million below sell-side expectations on headwinds from Apple,"" he said. ""What is perplexing to us, however, is that the $50 million in lower revenue for the December quarter is not coming back in the March quarter — certainly not to the extent we (and others) had hoped given an improving backdrop for China, Huawei share gains and our view that iPhone demand is not perishable and any delay in builds should simply shift into the March quarter.""Ackerman reiterated his market-perform rating on Qorvo and cut his price target to 80 from 85.Greensboro, N.C.-based Qorvo makes radio-frequency chips for mobile devices, communications infrastructure and aerospace and defense applications. Qorvo gets about 35% of its sales from Apple.IBD'S TAKE: The IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks includes seven chip-industry players.Elsewhere in the chip sector Thursday, Qualcomm (QCOM) received several price-target increases to its stock after its earnings report late Wednesday, while Impinj (PI) was smacked with a downgrade and a several price-target cuts following its earnings report.Qualcomm stock closed 2.6% higher to 54.84.

That offered a trade with reasonable downside risk of 2.8%. One contract gives the holder the right to buy, but not the obligation, to buy 100 shares of Alibaba at 182.50 for a cost of $510, excluding commission.Keep in mind that when taking the premium paid into account, Alibaba would have to rally north of 187 for the trade to start making money. If Alibaba falls on earnings, the most that can be lost on the option trade is the amount paid for the contract; in this case, $510.You can learn more about IBD's earnings option strategy here.Shares of Facebook (FB) were up a fraction.

Shares tumbled below their 200-day line on Wednesday but regained that key level by the end of the week.New General Electric (GE) CEO John Flannery offered up a plan to turn around the troubled industrial giant, but Wall Street found GE's strategic vision held little that was new or bold.

Investors sent GE shares to a nearly six-year low.Cisco Systems (CSCO) surged to a 17-year high after the computer networking giant said it expects December-quarter revenue to rise 1%-3%, the first year-over-year gain in nearly two years.

Analysts were modeling for EPS of $2.03 on sales of $14.36 billion.Semiconductor-equipment giant Applied Materials (AMAT) beat fiscal fourth quarter sales and earnings targets and guided higher for the current quarter.

That aggressive new target hinges on a next-gen EV platform by 2021, with less costly batteries.Inflation appears to be firming, but hurricane recovery may be playing a role, new Labor Department data suggested. Core consumer prices, excluding food and energy, rose 1.8% from a year ago, with an annualized 2.4% gain over the past three months. Rent inflation has been behind the recent strength, but used car prices also bounced in October, likely a temporary effect of demand created when hurricanes Harvey and Irma destroyed hundreds of thousands of vehicles.While all evidence suggests the economy is on something of a roll, retail sales moderated after surging an upwardly revised 1.9% in September. The overall 0.2% gain edged past expectations, but came in on the weak side outside of autos with a 0.1% rise.Emirates announced an order for 40 Boeing (BA) 787-10s, valued at $15.1 billion at list prices, instead of the expected Airbus (EADSY) A380 order.

But the struggling retailer said earnings per share next year could fall by as much as 20%, citing flat same-store sales and plans to spend money on e-commerce, private brands and other investments. Dick's shares fell Tuesday but rose for teh week. However, Foot Locker (FL) and Hibbett Sports (HIBB) reported better-than-expected earnings, sending their shares soaring Friday.

Stockpiles increased by 1.9 million barrels. Analysts expected a drop of 1 million barrels. In its World Energy Outlook, the International Energy Agency estimated that U.S. output would jump 25% — to 30 million barrels of oil equivalent per day from 24 million currently.

197,QCOM,"Verizon Communications' (VZ) goal of leading the U.S. in rolling out 5G wireless services will pressure China as global standards are finalized, says a Jefferies report.XVerizon has focused early trials on ""fixed"" 5G — providing high-speed internet services to homes that would compete with the broadband services of cable firms such as Comcast (CMCSA). Verizon's fixed 5G services would use high-frequency spectrum. The first commercial deployments, possibly for apartment buildings, are expected in 2018.Verizon and wireless firms worldwide also focus on 5G deployment over mobile networks. Mobile 5G services for smartphones and other devices aren't expected to arrive until 2020.Global standards for mobile 5G are being finalized and China wants a big say in what they are, says Edison Lee, a Jefferies analyst based in Hong Kong. Verizon is also looking at higher frequencies for mobile 5G, says the Jefferies analyst.""Verizon is shifting its focus in 5G from a fixed wireless solution to a real mobile service, which will be based on the 3GPP-developed new radio access standard,"" Lee said in a note to clients. 3GPP is an industry group formally known as the 3rd Generation Partnership Project.Lee added: ""(Verizon) now seems to have realized that a real mobile 5G service has to be globally compatible.""China is less focused on residential broadband than Verizon. Chinese makers of network equipment, led by Huawei, aim to supply 5G gear worldwide. Verizon has been working with Qualcomm (QCOM), Intel (INTC) and others. Lee says China is focused on using low frequency radio bands for 5G, unlike Verizon.IBD'S TAKE: Verizon stock is down 8% in 2017 but rebounded last week on better-than-expected revenue growth and wireless results. Verizon's wireless growth is key to sustaining its high dividend to shareholders, analysts say. Learn more at IBD Stock Checkup.   ""China sees low frequencies being able to meet its need of wide-area coverage better,"" said Lee in the report. ""Now that Verizon's collaboration with Qualcomm aims to accelerate the commercialization of 5G (high frequency) technology based on the 3GPP-standard, we believe it will put more pressure on China to accelerate its efforts to roll out 5G, which will be at low frequencies.""Analysts expect 5G to evolve on multiple tracks: the Internet of Things, mobile/smartphones, and fixed residential broadband. IoT encompasses such burgeoning areas as self-driving cars, advanced robotics, telemedicine, and smart cities.Verizon stock fell 1.1% to close at 48.99 on the stock market today.RELATED:Joined At The Hip With Weibo, Future Of Aging Sina Is At StakeT-Mobile, Sprint Silent On If Deal Is Imminent Or At ImpasseCable TV's Hail Mary: Hike Broadband Prices Amid Cord-Cutting

199,QCOM,"Biotechs and megacap techs helped lead stocks moderately lower in Tuesday afternoon trading, and volume was running higher vs. Monday on both exchanges. The action suggests that institutional investors were actively taking profits.XIf the Nasdaq composite, currently down nearly 0.3%, finishes at least 0.2% lower and volume climbs vs. the prior session, the leading index will have chalked up a seventh distribution day, a clearly elevated level. However, none of the six distribution days already logged in recent weeks showed a decline of 1% or more.Read more about why the distribution count matters in IBD's flagship daily markets analysis, The Big Picture.At 3:45 p.m. ET, the Nasdaq was off as much as 0.7% before paring losses.

Tesla, still a large cap with a $51 billion market value, has 168 million shares outstanding.Watch to see if Tesla can rebound back above the 200-day moving average. At 309, Tesla is currently 21% below its 52-week high of 389.61.

But volume was running much lighter than a normal, a good sign for those who bought at the most recent 160.97 breakout point in an eight-week cup with handle.The gain from the most recent proper entry is now 6.4%, so shares are still too far extended to buy.

""The teardown indicated content gains for Broadcom and Skyworks compared to iPhone 8. While Qorvo (QRVO) chips were not identified in the (iFixit) report, we expect they were represented in the Intel (INTC) baseband version.""The iPhone X went on sale Friday after a week of online preorders.Broadcom likely is supplying eight chips for the iPhone X and iPhone 8 series, up from five chips in last year's models, Vinh said. It is providing radio frequency, power amplifier, touch controller and wireless charging chips, he said.Five Skyworks power-amplifier chips were identified in the iPhone X teardown, compared with four chips in the iPhone 8, he said.""We are estimating a modest content increase in iPhone X"" for Skyworks, Vinh said.IBD'S TAKE: For the latest news on chip stocks, visit IBD's news page Chip Stocks To Watch And Semiconductor Industry News.Cirrus Logic likely has a stable presence in the iPhone X for its audio chips compared with last year's iPhones, he said.Fast-charging chips from Cypress Semiconductor (CY) were not identified in the initial teardown report, but are extremely small and likely not yet identified, Vinh said.Vinh rates Broadcom, Cirrus Logic, Cypress and Skyworks as his favorite Apple chip stocks.His price targets on those stocks are Broadcom at 290, Cirrus Logic at 70, Cypress at 18 and Skyworks at 120.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Broadcom added 1.4% to 277.52, while Skyworks was up 2.8% to 116.33. Cirrus Logic climbed 2.2% to 57.64. Cypress was up 2.6% to 16.51.Broadcom gets about 20% of its revenue from Apple, RBC Capital Markets says. Cirrus Logic gets an estimated 82% and Skyworks gets less than 40% of its revenue from Apple, RBC says. RBC did not have an estimate for Cypress.RELATED:Apple Gives Rare Bullish Outlook As iPhone X Hits Stores; Stock At Record

206,QCOM,"Stocks were modestly higher Monday afternoon, as semiconductor stocks made headlines, but energy shares also performed well.XThe Nasdaq climbed 0.3%, in large part because Broadcom's (AVGO) $130 billion bid for Qualcomm (QCOM) sparked a rally in chip stocks. IBD's chipmaker and chip-design industry groups were up 1.4% and 2.2%, but the chip-equipment group was slightly lower.The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average were up 0.1%.  Verizon (VZ) was a drag on the Dow, gapping down about 4.5% in large volume. The sell-off followed news that Sprint (S) and T-Mobile US (TMUS) ended merger talks. Investors worry the collapse will re-intensify wireless competition.The Russell 2000 added 0.3%, mirroring the Nasdaq's performance in afternoon trading.Other movers included American Tower Realty (AMT), the latest in a series of breakouts among real estate investment trusts. American Tower, which owns cellular towers for wireless phone use and broadcasting companies, gapped up above the 148.81 buy point in big volume.While Broadcom (which reversed lower) and Qualcomm (well off session highs) dominated news in the semiconductor space, other chip stocks were acting bullishly.Marvell Technology (MRVL) surged 9%, rising from support at the 50-day moving average in heavy trading, and Cavium (CAVM) broke out past the 70.18 buy point of a cup-with-handle base in tremendous turnover. The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that Marvell is in talks to acquire Cavium.Kulicke & Soffa (KLIC) broke out of an undefined pattern, clearing a 23.10 buy point in heavy trading. The Singapore-based chip-equipment company will report fiscal-quarter results Nov. 14 before the market opens.But it was the energy sector that led the market, with drilling, exploration and other companies making strong headway in today's trading. Oil prices hit the highest level in more than two years, with WTI crude oil futures for December delivery up 2.5% to $57.06 a barrel.Matador Resources (MTDR) broke out of a cup-with-handle base just hours before it announces its third-quarter earnings. The stock climbed above the 27.98 buy point but volume was unimpressive. Analysts expect the Dallas-based oil & gas exploration company to earn 10 cents a share, an increase of 67% from the year-ago quarter.Eni (E) was another oil stock breaking out. The Italy-based oil company rose past the 33.60 buy point of a cup-with-handle base in hefty volume. The government of Italy may sell part of its 4.3% stake in Eni plus its holding in air traffic controller Enav to reduce debt, Bloomberg reported, citing sources familiar with the matter.Cenovus Energy (CVE) climbed above the 10.79 entry of a flat base that developed within a larger consolidation.RELATED:AMD, Intel Team Up To Take On Nvidia In Gaming LaptopsChip Stocks To Watch And Semiconductor Industry NewsTower Firms Up, Telecoms Fall On Failed T-Mobile-Sprint Merger

207,QCOM,"Tech stocks led the major market indexes higher Monday as the Broadcom (AVGO)-Qualcomm (QCOM) deal grabbed the spotlight.X PowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ) gained 0.3%, while SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) and SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) each climbed 0.1%. Emerging markets outperformed with iShares MSCI Emerging Markets (EEM) rallied 1.1%.QQQ hit an all-time high as tech stocks advanced. Apple (AAPL) was up more than 1% at a record high and is extended from a 160.97 cup-with-handle buy point. Apple retail stores reportedly sold out of the new iPhone X by Sunday evening.Energy, semiconductor and real estate were among the biggest sector fund gainers in the stock market today. VanEck Vectors Semiconductor (SMH) and iShares PHLX Semiconductor (SOXX) gapped up and rose more than 1% each. Qualcomm rose 2% to extend Friday's 13% surge, which occurred amid Broadcom's offer to buy the chipmaker in a deal valued at $130 billion.Also among chips, Intel (INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) were higher on reports the two chip companies are teaming up.Oil and gold funds were mostly higher as the respective underlying commodities saw price gains. VanEck Vectors Oil Services (OIH) and SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production (XOP) surged nearly 4% each, the latter to a six-month high. West Texas intermediate crude prices gained 3% to $57.29 a barrel.VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners (GDXJ) and VanEck Vectors Gold Miners (GDX) were up more than 2% apiece. Gold futures rose 1% to $1,282.30 an ounce.Consumer staples, banks and utilities underperformed.Large-cap growth funds holding Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and other big techs continue to dominate this year as the market keeps climbing into record high territory.All but one of the exchange traded funds on the accompanying chart are in Morningstar Direct's large growth category. However, the solo non-big-cap fund on the list is also the top performer based on year-to-date returns through Oct. 31.Innovator IBD 50 (FFTY) racked up a 38.2% gain, thanks in part to a 15.1% jump in the past three months. That's more than double the S&P 500's 16.9% return. Morningstar Direct classifies the $186.4 million fund as midcap growth. FFTY is out of buy range from a 30.23 flat-base entry cleared in late August. But a new buy opportunity could arise if shares pull back to and find support at the 50-day moving average.Launched in April 2015 in partnership with Innovator Capital Management, the ETF tracks the IBD 50 Index, which comprises the top 50 growth stocks selected by IBD. Companies in the index tend to share traits of the market's biggest winning stocks such as outstanding profit and sales growth, wide profit margins and a high return on equity.FFTY's top holdings as of Nov. 2 included chip names Nvidia (NVDA) and Lam Research (LRCX), Universal Display (OLED) and Align Technology (ALGN). Nvidia has nearly doubled in price this year, while Universal Display has surged over 180%. With Innovator Capital Management's IBD 50 ETF, you can trade the IBD 50 in just one transaction.Up next is iShares Edge MSCI USA Momentum Factor (MTUM), with a 33.6% YTD gain. The fund is trading at all-time highs and is extended from several rebounds off its 50-day line. The $4.6 billion fund, which tracks the MSCI USA Momentum Index, marked its fourth anniversary in April.Information technology accounted for the biggest chunk of assets at 34%, followed by 25% in financials and about 13% each in consumer discretionary and health care. Industrials made up 12%. Top holdings as of Nov. 2 included Microsoft, Bank of America (BAC), Apple and Nvidia.Apple shares gapped up Friday to a new high, after delivering an upside earnings surprise late Thursday. It's now out of buy range from a 160.97 cup-with-handle entry.IBD'S TAKE: On the lookout for ETF ideas that may be worth a closer look?

The 19-year-old fund tracks the Nasdaq 100 Index and has amassed $55.9 billion in assets. Among its top names: Apple, Microsoft, Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (FB) and Alphabet (GOOGL).QQQ has outperformed the S&P 500 over the long haul with annual average returns of 20% and 11.7% over the past five and 10 years, respectively, vs. the benchmark index's 15.2% and 7.5% gains. The ETF is near the top of a buy range from a 146.06 entry initially cleared Aug. 31.RELATED:IBD 50 ETF Debuts At The Top; China, Brazil, Bitcoin Still HotApple, Alphabet, Amazon Earnings Fuel Top Tech Equity PlaysApple, Facebook In Buy Range Ahead Of Earnings; Bitcoin Soars

208,QCOM,"Apple (AAPL) helped boost the Nasdaq composite to new all-time highs and a mild gain. Merger fever in the semiconductor sector also helped lift the Nasdaq.XApple, up 1.1% to 174.36 and new all-time highs, has now jumped more than 11% past an Aug. 2 breakout from a flat base with a 156.75 entry. The iPhone and iMac giant is also steadily gaining ground from its newest buy point, a nearly eight-week cup with handle at 160.97.At 4pm ET, the Nasdaq composite held on to most of its moderate gains, rising 0.3%, while the Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500 notched gains of around 0.1%. But the latter two indexes closed nearly at session highs, a bullish sign.Strong rallies by certain computer and internet-oriented tech stocks offset sharp declines by stocks in the supermarket, medical services, medical supplies, drugstore, automaker, gaming software, meat and other defensive food industry groups.The S&P SmallCap 600 rose 0.2% and the Russell 2000 gained 0.3%. Volume fell slightly on both exchanges. The Dow transports fell 0.2%; the Dow Jones utility average dropped more than 0.5% after a huge gain in crude oil prices following political turmoil in the highest levels of government in Saudi Arabia.WTI futures jumped 3% to $57.36 a barrel on the NYMEX.Back to Apple, it's important to remember that the best time to buy Apple over the past 12 months actually came in January, when the megacap name burst out of an excellent cup with handle.That top-notch pattern, repeated time and time again by many of the greatest stock market winners in history, featured a 118.12 buy point. (Find the proper entry in a cup with handle by adding 10 cents to the highest price within the handle portion.) Since shares have already gained more than 45% from that proper entry, it obviously will be more challenging for Apple to rise another 20% from its latest proper entry points.However, Apple has shown it can maintain conservative guidance, and over-deliver. Fiscal Q4 earnings jumped 24% to $2.07 a share, the best gain in eight quarters, on a 12% pickup in revenue to $52.58 billion. And the Street thinks Apple can grow its earnings in the double digits for at least a fourth straight quarter (up 12% to $3.76 a share).Three more reasons why the market bears shouldn't knock Apple:One, the up/down volume ratio in Apple's Stock Checkup (a proprietary tool available only at Investors.com) is now back at 1.1, above the neutral 1.0 level. Prefer those companies that show a ratio of greater than 1.0, which means that volume is heavier on the stock's up days in price vs. down days over the past 50 sessions.Two, the RS line is hitting new high ground (see it in blue in IBD's daily and weekly charts, and in MarketSmith).Three, the Relative Price Strength Rating (different from the relative strength line, which graphs a stock's performance against the daily action of the S&P 500) is approaching a nine-week high of 89.The Philadelphia semiconductor index, known as the SOX, rallied 1.3% and is now up 45% year to date. The possibility of Broadcom (AVGO) acquiring wireless chip technology expert Qualcomm (QCOM) has fueled speculation of further consolidation in the massive industry.Among IBD's 33 sector rankings (see them in IBD's stock research tables, part of IBD's Data Tables), the Chips sector is ranked No. 1 in terms of mid- and long-term relative performance. Broadcom, which has thrived since its merger with Singapore-based Avago Technologies in 2016, rallied more than 1% to 277.53 and is out of buy range after clearing a 259.46 flat-base buy point on Oct. 30.In IBD Leaderboard, Palo Alto Networks (PANW) is trying to recover after a summary sell-off in the security software industry. Palo Alto fell after peer Check Point Software (CHKP) plunged more than 12% despite Q3 results that beat on the earnings side (EPS up 15% to $1.30 a share, 6 cents above the Thomson Reuters consensus view).Palo Alto, which is growing its earnings and revenue at a faster pace, gained 1% to 147.77 in quiet trading and is now back above an aggressive entry near 144. (On select stocks, the Leaderboard charts offer annotations pointing to exact buy points and sell signals.)The Street sees fiscal Q1 earnings rising 25% to 69 cents a share following EPS gains of 126%, 100%, 136%, 62%, 47%, 33% and 39% vs. year-ago levels in the prior seven quarters.Palo Alto gets the highest EPS Rating within IBD's Computer Software-Security industry group at 99 on a scale to 1 to 99. Qualys (QLYS) has the second best EPS Rating, which covers long- and short-term profit growth and is compared with all other companies in IBD's database, at 96.However, Palo Alto, a mid-cap software play, is still trying to reach 52-week highs as it exits a long, deep bottoming base pattern. This helps explain why Palo Alto, with a so-so Composite Rating of 83, is what Apple was at the end of last year: a potential turnaround play.Qualys is having a terrific time since clearing a 10-week flat base with a 44.45 buy point on Aug. 3. Shares have since risen more than 28%, justifying the move to take at least some gains based on one of IBD's top sell rules: taking gains at 20% to 25% from a proper entry.Software is ranked No. 15 out of 33 sectors. Palo Alto's security software group is ranked a so-so 83rd among 197 IBD industry groups and subgroups over the past six months, trailing sector counterparts gaming software (No. 14, please see Activision-Blizzard (ATVI) and Electronic Arts (EA)); desktop software (No. 17, topped by Microsoft (MSFT)); and specialty enterprise software (No. 28, headed by Atlassian (TEAM) and Alarm.com (ALRM)).The large enterprise software industry group is No. 41.Elsewhere, REIT stock American Tower (AMT) blasted more than 5% higher to 150.16 in turnover racing 88% above its 50-day average and took out a new 148.81 buy point in a nine-week cup. Average daily volume is 2.08 million shares, and as of 3 p.m. ET turnover has already exceeded 2.9 million shares.Please go to IBD's New Highs column to read more about American Tower and other highly rated stocks rushing out of new bases and into new high ground.IBD's TAKE: Taking many gains when your stock has risen 20% to 25% past a proper buy point is an excellent way to build a strong overall return. Not only are you locking in gains in a stock on the way up, but you are also freeing up cash to possibly put into another top market leader.

Wall Street breathed a bit easier when it became clear that Powell would get the nod, because he is expected to follow Yellen's low-interest-rate path. Powell, a Republican and former investment banker who served in the George H.W.

216,QCOM,"If the Trump administration pushes through a tax reform package in 2018 that includes relief on foreign profits brought into the U.S., Goldman Sachs has a new way to look at the biggest potential gainers.Proposed changes on ""repatriated"" overseas cash are part of a bigger Trump tax reform package. The companies currently with the most overseas cash are Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Cisco Systems (CSCO), Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google and Oracle (ORCL). Many Wall Street analysts have speculated that cash brought back into the U.S. could be used for stock buybacks or acquisitions.Goldman Sachs in a report focuses on stocks with the highest overseas cash-to-equity cap ratio. The top seven companies, Goldman Sachs says, would be Cisco, NetApp (NTAP), Qualcomm (QCOM), Apple, Amgen (AMGN), Oracle and Microsoft.A bit further down would be Western Digital (WDC), Citrix Systems (CTXS), General Electric (GE) and Abbott Laboratories (ABT).Goldman Sachs forecasts that U.S. firms would repatriate $250 billion of their overseas cash in 2018, if a tax reform package is approved.IBD'S TAKE: Try out premium IBD features for free through Oct. 8.

217,QCOM,"It may seem a bit far out — plans to send humans on a roughly seven-month, 34-million-mile ride to Mars, all for the privilege of standing where temperatures can get to 100 degrees below zero.XBut colonizing Mars is a central reason Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla (TSLA),  founded his rocket-ship company SpaceX 15 years ago. Musk, who spends equal time between Tesla and SpaceX, is one of four billionaires who are using their fortunes to fulfill a passion for space exploration and tourism.The four have attracted a fleet of venture capitalists, big corporations and other investors into a private-sector space race of sorts. They imagine a world where entrepreneurs can create business opportunities in space that include galaxies of small satellites controlling gadgets on the ground and initiatives to send humans on thrill rides to the moon, all outside the reach of government budget battles and a fickle voting public. Musk has said many times that the ultimate goal of SpaceX is to make Earth's population a space-faring society.SpaceX, based in Los Angeles County, already has taken a step into the heavens, ferrying supplies to the International Space Station. It's keeping an eye on further commercial exploration of the final frontier.""It's a fantastic time to be in the industry,"" said Carissa Bryce Christensen, founder of Bryce Space and Technology, a research and consulting firm for space and satellite industries.Startup space ventures have attracted more than $16.6 billion in investments since 2000, Christensen says. That money has funded 140 new companies, two-thirds of them in the last five years and most of them in the satellite business, she adds. Last year alone, $2.8 billion was pumped into 43 startup space ventures.""Musk changed the narrative, transforming the way people think and talk about space technology in a very inspirational way,"" Christensen said.Other billionaires doing business in the great beyond include Amazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos, who established Blue Origin 16 years ago to make rocket ships for space tourism and science missions. Bezos recently said he sells about $1 billion in Amazon stock a year to finance his Blue Origin rocket company.Microsoft (MSFT) co-founder Paul Allen has Stratolaunch Systems, which he co-founded to build the world's largest aircraft by wingspan, able to carry rockets to the edge of space to deliver small satellites into orbit. It has a partnership with Orbital ATK (OA).And Virgin Group founder Richard Branson is another space enthusiast. His company, Virgin Galactic, aims to be ready to launch its first passengers on thrill rides to suborbital space later this year. The cost per seat? $250,000. The spacecraft seats six with a two-person crew. Science missions are also planned.Musk, Bezos, Branson and Allen have brought back to life a U.S. space business that was demoralized by the retirement of the space shuttle fleet in 2011, Christensen says. Of the four, Musk has done the most to demonstrate an economic case for space, enticing previously reluctant venture capitalists to invest billions in the commercial transports outside the stratosphere.Musk founded SpaceX with $100 million of his own money, acquired from the sale of PayPal (PYPL), which he co-founded, to eBay (EBAY) for $1.4 billion. SpaceX now has a private-sector valuation of about $12 billion and holds multibillion-dollar contracts with NASA to resupply the International Space Station and deliver astronauts to and from the station. SpaceX also has extensive contracts to launch commercial satellites.Bezos' Blue Origin has made several test flights of its rocket, New Shepard, which is designed as a reusable spacecraft for space tourism that will fly passengers to the edge of space, about 62 miles high. It has made several successful launches but has not yet begun commercial operations.Blue Origin is building another rocket ship, called New Glenn, that it says will be taller and more powerful than the biggest rocket in development by SpaceX, the Falcon Heavy. The company's rockets are named after two of the original seven NASA Mercury astronauts, Alan Shepard and John Glenn.IBD'S TAKE: New products or services are part of the N in IBD's CAN SLIM investing system. New products or services are what ultimately generates stellar profitability. None of the four billionaire-founded space startups in this article trades publicly, but you can scroll our IBD 50 list of top stocks to discover other innovative companies. Bezos made billions from his creation of Amazon, which he has used to self-fund most of Blue Origin. He's pumped an estimated $1 billion in Blue Origin. In 2015, Google and Fidelity invested $1 billion in SpaceX.SpaceX initially fueled the jump in space activity by pushing down the cost of rocket launches. That put the ability to catch a ride to space well within the reach of entrepreneurs to create various commercial space operations.Phillip Spector, counsel at the Washington, D.C., office of Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy, says lowering the cost of space access was critical for commercial expansion. Before joining Milbank, Spector was executive vice president of business development and general counsel at Intelsat (I), one of the largest satellite operators worldwide.At Intelsat, ""The biggest issue we faced was around launch, the pricing for launch and availability. There were not enough suppliers,"" Spector said. ""The addition of competition from SpaceX was very welcome.""Investors have yet to benefit from this new wave of enthusiasm.Shares of many large space companies and government contractors have long traded on the public markets, including Boeing (BA), Lockheed Martin (LMT), Orbital ATK, Harris Corp. (HRS), ViaSat (VSAT) and Orbcomm (ORBC). Boeing and Lockheed Martin have a joint venture called the United Launch Alliance that provides spacecraft launch services and competes against SpaceX.But there has yet to be a high-profile IPO from the crop of startup companies now flooding the market. The company best positioned for a possible IPO is SpaceX, which would undoubtedly draw widespread attention. But SpaceX recently shot down rumors that a public stock offering was in the planning.""Musk has been clear about not wanting to take SpaceX public,"" said Spector. ""We're not seeing a rush to IPOs among space companies out here today. I don't see Bezos or Branson having the need to take their company public.""But that hasn't stopped the chunks of money flowing into the market.""The funding environment for startup companies is robust,"" said Spector.Startup companies have focused on a number of narrow business models. One is building and launching fleets of small satellites to circle the Earth in a low orbit.They're using the satellites to study agriculture trends, track ships, produce high-frequency weather reports and study water pollution patterns, among other things. There's also a big market in the making with the advent of what's called the Internet of Things, which includes machine-to-machine communication.""These startups are doing some truly innovative things, using off-the-shelf technology and getting near the performance of assets that were 10 times the cost,"" said Dara Panahy, a Milbank partner who represents clients in aerospace and communications. ""That is a real game-changer.""Then there are massive projects such as OneWeb, which plans to launch the first of 700 satellites next year to provide high-speed internet and other communication services. Partners in the OneWeb venture include Branson, Qualcomm (QCOM), SoftBank (SFTBY), Airbus (EADSY) and Coca-Cola (KO). Investors plowed $1.2 billion into OneWeb in 2016.""The market has matured and grown and, along with some of the other enabling technologies, that lowered barriers to getting into space,"" said Panahy. ""So now you have true venture-capital-funded startups and angel-funded startups that can now launch on maybe less than $100,000.""That compares with launches in the tens of millions and even hundreds of millions of dollars in some cases today.Among the space startups is Rocket Lab, which has developed a rocket from scratch that's designed for frequent launches to low Earth orbit. Rocket Lab had the first test of its rocket, called Electron, in May. It plans to conduct two more test flights in 2017 and launch customer payloads next year.At full production, Rocket Lab expects to launch more than 50 times a year. In comparison, last year saw 22 launches from the U.S. and 82 internationally, according to Rocket Lab.Acquisitions have helped draw venture capital. They're the primary way VCs get a return on investment. Fifteen space-related companies have been acquired for a total value of $3.2 billion since 2000, demonstrating a return on investment that venture capitalists want to see.Among the acquisitions, Europe-based satellite operator SES paid $703 million to buy the other half of a company called O3b it didn't already own. O3b is a big player in the small-satellite communication field.Another startup is Planet, a maker of small satellites, with about 100 now in orbit, some about the size of a shoe box. Planet, previously known as Planet Labs, can image the whole Earth every 24 hours, providing data that can be used to solve commercial, environmental and humanitarian challenges.RELATED: In Jeff Bezos-Elon Musk Space Race, Score One For Amazon's BezosSpaceX Rocket Explosion Comes At Worst Possible Time For MuskSpaceX Jumps Aboard Space Tourism With Planned Moon Flight For TwoBezos To Launch Blue Origin Rockets At Cape Canaveral

218,QCOM,"When you leave home, do you worry that you left a door unlocked or forgot to set the alarm, and subsequently wasted large portions of your life driving all the way back to double-check?Alarm.com (ALRM) thinks it has a fix for you.XThe company, which develops cloud-based security and automation technology for homes and businesses, has brought in a lot of sales taking on the anxieties and the obsessive-compulsive urges that have worn on homeowners' minds since, well, homeownership was a thing. So shares of the company, which analysts say was an early adopter of smart-home technology, have risen roughly 150% since they began trading in 2015.The stock's charge also has been helped by a deal, announced last year and closed this year, that has made home-security giant ADT among Alarm.com's biggest clients. And as the business of alarm service moves to the cloud from the phone line, analysts say Alarm.com has gotten more revenue from existing customers by offering them an increasing number of ways to monitor their properties, many with the tap of a smartphone.""It's not a new problem that you just drove down to Florida and realized, 'Oh man, I may have left my garage door open,'"" Raymond James analyst Tavis McCourt said. ""People were stupid 30 years ago, too, but now we have the technology to fix it.""Along with closing a garage door remotely, Alarm.com customers, through the company's apps, can lock and unlock doors, view who comes to their home's front door and adjust its lights or thermostats. They can adjust devices according to preset or customizable ""scenes"" to increase comfort when they go to bed or want to save energy when they leave the house. A drone that watches over your property? That's also in the works through a collaboration with Qualcomm (QCOM).""Consumers today view home security as a technology solution that's far more useful and valued than traditional systems,"" company spokesman Matt Zartman said in an email.The market research firm Parks Associates estimates that as many as 16 million North American households will have smart-home security by 2021, compared with 10 million forecast for traditional security platforms. As security gets smarter, analysts also see a greater opportunity for Alarm.com to take share in small to medium-sized businesses, vacation homes and medical monitoring — and eventually in overseas markets.""Any type of sensor-based application you can think of, these guys have gotten involved in and they are increasing their capabilities now toward (security of) family, wellness protection, health care, things that the alarm guys didn't think about years ago,"" Imperial Capital analyst Jeff Kessler said.Customers usually are one of the many smaller security-system providers in the country. When one signs on, Alarm.com provides the sensors and software that bring the thermostats, water meters and other parts of a property online. The security company pays a portion of the revenue it gets from customers back to Alarm.com.That approach, in which the provider can use the panels and smart devices they want on top of Alarm.com's software, has proved advantageous. As the company grows and incorporates new features into its system, it has kept support services abundant and operations easy for installers, service staff and users who might not be tech-savvy, Kessler said.In a recent research note, Kessler described a visit to a smart-home demonstration house in Falls Church, Va., noting how easily a ""new associate"" at the company was able to outline the technology's functionality. And he noted its potential compatibility with other existing smart devices.He said that with the touch of a button or a simple command to a virtual assistant, such features could be used to adjust the lighting, temperature and other functions to create ideal environments for sleeping, dinner or watching sports.Shares of Alarm.com also bounded higher this month after it reported second-quarter earnings, helped by 40% growth in its licensing and software-as-a-service sales. Gains in the hardware it sells — including cameras and video-camera doorbells — helped too.Acquisitions have also played an important role for the company. The company in March said it closed the acquisition of a part of Icontrol Networks. That purchase gave it Connect, a company that offers a home-security and automation platform used by ADT Pulse, ADT's own smart security system.""When the company announced the acquisition of Icontrol (last year) the valuation really improved materially,"" McCourt said.Nearly all of Alarm.com's business is in the U.S., but it has expanded its offerings to Latin America, Australia, Turkey, South Africa and elsewhere. Its wellness business, Kessler said, has the potential to become massive. In that segment, the company's services help family members remotely monitor the conditions and activity of loved ones — whether daily routines have changed or if they've been in bed for an abnormally long period — and respond quickly if there's an emergency.IBD'S TAKE: Alarm.com finished in a buy zone Aug. 4 and has kept climbing ever since. The company has a best-possible Composite Rating of 99. To learn more about where the stock and its industry group stand, visit IBD Stock Checkup.However, Kessler said, more established procedures between health insurers, end users and others — among them, who pays for what — would be needed before Alarm.com's wellness business can further take off. And even as the company churns out earnings growth, McCourt said the company is still focused on investing in growth. Analysts see earnings-per-share growth slowing in the next two quarters and declining into the first half of next year before picking back up.But a bigger threat to Alarm.com is, in part, the nature of home security itself, which easily lends itself to do-it-yourself projects. Consumers can buy security cameras, thermostats and lights themselves at a store.""In other words, there are plenty of ways to get home automation in your home,"" McCourt said. ""You don't need to subscribe from an alarm-monitoring company.""However, even amid increased advertising for DIY security setups, property security dealers that work with Alarm.com hadn't seen a major dent in demand during the second quarter, William Blair analyst Bhavan Suri wrote in a research note.""Some of the advertising has actually helped Alarm.com through educating the market about functionality, including video doorbells, which have been a driver of new Alarm.com activations and have had better traction than anticipated,"" he said.Also looming over Alarm.com's prospects are Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN) and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google. Alarm.com already allows someone to control home functions in their home via an Apple Watch, and its technology also integrates with the Google's Nest thermostats. But the tech giants' plans for their smart-home technology remain unclear.More directly, the company also faces competition from Honeywell (HON), which has a smart-home service, and bigger threats from telecom giants like Comcast (CMCSA) and AT&T (T). Comcast's XFinity and AT&T's security services allow people to manage their home security via mobile device.The company's Zartman said in his email that he sees ""a lot of partnership opportunities"" with the telecom and tech giants in the near-term. Still, those far bigger companies have more ability to drop into a market and cut prices to draw customers.But amid a broader cord-cutting movement, attrition rates for the cable companies remain high. Building a network that can work with police and paramedics also isn't easy, and false alarms can kill emergency responders' confidence, Kessler said.""Police and medical people and responders are overstressed to begin with, with all these new systems out there,"" he said.Shares of Alarm.com were up 1% in recent trades to 42.63.RELATED:This No. 1 Ranked Security Stock May Unlock New BreakoutComcast Could Partner With Altice To Acquire Charter, Says CitigroupBig Media Just Gave Sports Fans Another Reason To Cut The Cord

219,QCOM,"Noticeably smaller crowds turned out to buy Apple's (AAPL) iPhone 8 on its first day of availability Friday as analysts chalked it up to Apple fans waiting for the company's premium iPhone X smartphone, due in six weeks.XApple shares fell once again, with the stock down more than 5% for the week as of Friday morning.Reuters described the launch of the iPhone 8 as ""muted"" in Australia and Asia, the first markets to start selling the new phone, compared with previous new handsets from the consumer electronics giant. It cited lackluster reviews for the iPhone 8 as a potential reason for the lack of enthusiasm for the device.Reviewers said the iPhone 8-series smartphones are incremental upgrades to the LCD-screen iPhone 7-series phones released a year ago. The iPhone 8 adds wireless charging and boasts improved cameras and other upgraded components, compared with its predecessor.By contrast, the iPhone X, pronounced ""ten"" as in the Roman numeral, sports an OLED screen, facial recognition for secure log-in and a revamped design. Preorders for the iPhone X begin Oct. 27 and the device goes on sale Nov. 3.Apple's Regent Street store in London had more employees than customers when it opened for business on Friday, Mashable reported. The atmosphere was subdued and the queue of customers was underwhelming, the website said.One of the first iPhone 8 phones sold went to iFixit, a company that specializes in do-it-yourself repairs and is known for its ""teardowns"" of consumer devices. It opened the iPhone 8 and documented what it found in terms of components and how it can be repaired.The iFixit teardown analysis of the iPhone 8 innards found the usual suspects when it comes to chip suppliers, including Broadcom (AVGO) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS).The iPhone 8 that iFixit inspected also contained several chips from Qualcomm (QCOM), including an LTE modem. Apple and Qualcomm are locked in a bitter legal fight over patent licensing terms and royalty payments. Because of this, Apple is believed to be replacing Qualcomm chips with Intel (INTC) chips in some devices.IBD'S TAKE: Apple stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 80, meaning it has outperformed 80% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months. For more analysis of Apple, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.Piper Jaffray analyst Michael Olson on Friday reiterated his overweight rating on Apple stock and raised his price target to 196 from 190.Apple shares dropped just under 1% to close at 151.89 on the stock market today. Apple fell below a 156.75 buy point and its 50-day moving average earlier this week.Olson raised his sales and earnings estimates for Apple based on his assumption of higher average selling prices for iPhones because of the new handsets.Nomura Instinet analyst Jeffrey Kvaal maintained his buy rating and price target of 185.""Anticipation for the iPhone X may be weighing on iPhone 8 orders,"" Kvaal said in a report Friday. ""A unifying theme of the iPhone 8 reviews has been that the changes from the 7 to the 8 are incremental. We believe consumers are waiting for the feature-rich X, just as they did for the dual camera feature on the 7 Plus.""RELATED:Apple iPhone X Production, Supply Likely Delayed: AnalystApple's Pricey iPhone X Lacks Wireless Data Bragging Rights

220,QCOM,"Buyers of Apple's (AAPL) new, high-end iPhone X may get the world's best display and facial recognition but they'll have to do without top wireless data speeds if AT&T (T), T-Mobile U.S., Sprint and Verizon Communications (VZ) improve their networks as expected.XThe iPhone X's ""singular weakness is not using the fastest gigabit LTE modem available,"" said Patrick Moorhead, the principal analyst at Moor Insights and Strategy.Qualcomm (QCOM) and Intel (INTC) provide Apple with iPhone modems that connect to wireless networks. Qualcomm's X16 modem supports gigabit data speeds, analysts say, while Intel's modem does not. Gigabit-per-second data service is about 50 times faster than current average data speeds.Even if Qualcomm's X16 modem is be built into the iPhone X, Apple may throttle back its performance, says Walter Piecyk, analyst at BTIG Research. Keeping both modems on an even keel avoids customer complaints.""Apple's product presentation yesterday did not include any reference to gigabit-class LTE speeds, which likely implies that it is crippling the functionality of Qualcomm's latest chip capabilities to keep it at parity with Intel,"" Piecyk said in a blog post.Further, Qualcomm and Apple are facing off in federal court over Qualcomm's licensing for modem chips. Apple has alleged that Qualcomm is charging unfair prices for the technology and is engaging in anticompetitive practices.Apple unveiled the iPhone X on Tuesday. The iPhone starts at $999; a model with 256 gigabytes of memory costs $1,149.Samsung Electronic's Galaxy S8, a rival to the iPhone X, has Qualcomm's X16 LTE modem. Motorola and HTC will also have phones supporting superfast 4G LTE speeds, analysts say.AT&T, T-Mobile (TMUS), Sprint (S) and Verizon all have plans to push existing ""4G LTE"" networks to much faster speeds with more spectrum and antennas. 4G LTE networks may provide near gigabit-per-second data speeds before the arrival of much-touted 5G wireless networks.IBD'S TAKE: Apple stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 92, meaning it has outperformed 92% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months. For more analysis of Apple, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.On the other hand, wireless firms would likely provide gigabit LTE speeds on a limited basis near-term, not nationwide.While Apple's iPhone X may lag some smartphones in potential data performance, it still can handle mainstream wireless services.Ookla in a recent report said the average download speed on U.S. mobile networks in 2017 has reached 22.7 megabits per second. That's 19% faster than in 2016. T-Mobile led with average nationwide speeds of 23.2 Mbps, Ookla said.Apple stock slipped 0.8% to close at 159.65 on the stock market today.RELATED:Lumentum Slips, Analysts Ponder Apple's iPhone X Sensor ContentHow Apple Watch Could Boost AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, SprintApple Not The Only Stock Play In Augmented Reality: Morgan Stanley

222,QCOM,"IBD's chip sector is up more than 30% this year, making it one of the best stock market leaders, which in turn has made semiconductor ETFs attractive investments.Today, VanEck Vectors Semiconductor (SMH) has climbed to about 10% from its all-time high in June 2000, earning a spot in IBD's ETF Leaders screen as gains continue. The ETF broke out past an 89.82 buy point earlier this month and is in a buy range that stretches to 94.31.Is the ETF overheated after such a superb run? A study of the 25 holdings' charts suggests there's room for further gains. Most of the stocks are in their first or second bases since touching major lows, which on that basis alone makes them lower-risk investments.A few of the largest holdings have problematic charts, though. Nvidia (NVDA) has emerged from a risky late-stage base, yet the graphics chip specialist has been acting well since its Sept. 15 breakout. Applied Materials (AMAT) cleared a late-stage pattern Monday and hasn't followed through from it. Qualcomm (QCOM) has been trending downward for nearly a year.In terms of fundamentals, the information technology sector has just had a superb second quarter and is expected to have a strong third quarter. The IT sector is expected to have the second highest earnings growth of all 11 S&P sectors in Q3, an 8.3% increase according to FactSet.Of seven industries in this sector, only Semiconductor & Semiconductor Equipment is projected to report double-digit earnings growth, a 29% jump. ""The Semiconductor & Semiconductor Equipment industry is also expected to be the largest contributor to earnings growth for the sector,"" FactSet noted in a report Sept. 15.Revenue estimates for the chip and chip-equipment industry show a 13% increase for Q3, second best in the broader sector, to a 22% expected rise in Internet Software & Services profits.Demand for smartphones and other digital devices drives much of the chip industry's sales, but there's also growth in auto technology, data centers, graphics, self-driving cars, the Internet of Things and other areas. Stumbles in any of these, however, can spark selling. For example, on Wednesday many chip stocks fell as word spread that Apple's (AAPL) new iWatch model has connectivity issues.More than 75% of the fund is in U.S. stocks, but the largest holding is Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM). The foundry accounts for about 12% of the portfolio. Taiwan Semiconductor shares have made a productive advance since a breakout in February 2016 and are now in buy range from the most recent breakout, past resistance around 37.With a relatively small number of holdings, VanEck Vectors Semiconductor is essentially a large-cap ETF, with all stocks having a market capitalization above $5 billion.The IBD ETF Leaders index shows the performance of a model portfolio of exchange traded funds that are leading the overall market. A computer algorithm selects the ETFs based on relative strength and other objective performance ratings, with periodic adjustments for market trends and conditions.

223,QCOM,"Americans want smarter devices, homes, factories and cities, so STMicroelectronics (STM) has remade itself to deliver the smarts.One of Europe's largest semiconductor companies, STMicro is growing with red-hot demand for the chips needed for intelligent devices. Some on Wall Street seem convinced the outlook is promising for the venerable, 30-year-old Swiss firm whose stock struggled for more than a decade and a half following the dot-com boom and bust.""The outlook for 2018 is pretty much a historical high,"" Tristan Gerra, a semiconductor analyst for R.W. Baird, told Investor's Business Daily.""(STMicro) has methodically shut down businesses losing money or just breaking even, such as memory chips and cellphone chips,"" Gerra said. ""Now the result is you have a company that is much leaner that only has products that are profitable.""STMicro has benefited from relentless smartphone innovations, connected home devices and wearable tech gadgets, as well as emerging opportunities in the automotive and industrial sectors.A massive shift toward greener, safer and self-driving cars is one powerful engine of growth. The industrial Internet of Things — which connects machines to one another and the cloud, while harnessing the power of Big Data analytics to make factories more efficient — is another.STMicro stock has vaulted 125% in the past year. That is more than three times the return of the PHLX SOX Semiconductor Sector Index — dominated by U.S. giants Nvidia (NVDA), Intel (INTC) and Qualcomm (QCOM) — over the same period.Gerra believes STMicro stock has room to run despite the monster moves it already has made, rising to levels not seen in a decade. He has a price target of 20, which represents an upside of roughly 14%. Shares climbed into buy territory Thursday and have kept climbing since then. Shares ended the regular trading session Tuesday up 1.7% to 17.77.STMicro's surging profits and margins come as the firm has raised its capital expenditures to $1.25 billion to $1.3 billion, citing new products and higher demand, while alluding to design wins. Many investors and analysts understand the latter to mean the eagerly awaited 10th anniversary iPhone from Apple (AAPL).STMicro's 3D sensors are expected to power the upcoming iPhone's standout new feature: advanced facial-recognition technologies that may allow users to unlock devices and authenticate payments in a more seamless way, experts say.Improving fundamentals and a robust product portfolio make the stock ""well-positioned for a continued recovery with significantly less cyclicality going forward,"" Gerra said in a recent note, while highlighting the potential for further revenue momentum.Analyst views call for STMicro earnings to more than quadruple to 83 cents a share for fiscal 2017 from 19 cents for 2016, according to Zacks Investment Research. For 2018, that's projected to reach $1.10 a share, then rise to $1.16 in 2019, Zacks says.STMicro holds one of the broadest product portfolios in the chipmaking industry, according to investment research firm Morningstar Inc. And the firm is seeing strong growth in bookings across all its product lines and global regions.""We are firing on all cylinders,"" STMicro Executive Vice President Bob Krysiak told IBD. ""We have great pipelines in smartphones, automotives and across the mass-market space.""Besides Apple, major customers include Cisco (CSCO), Seagate (STX) and Western Digital (WDC), as well as Asian smartphone makers Huawei and Samsung. Its products end up in everything from cars and smartphones to drones, welding equipment, solar kits, thermostats and consumer electronics.Its micro-mirror MEMS chips in the Amazon (AMZN) Echo Look and near field communication (NFC) chips in the Samsung Galaxy S8 show how the company is innovating and pursuing new lines of growth, according to Gerra. NFC chips allow smart devices to talk to one another when brought physically together, such as pay card readers.The smartphone remains king for the company, notwithstanding slowing sales across the industry.""It's a big market that continues to innovate every year,"" Krysiak said. ""Smartphone makers depend on us suppliers to provide the innovation.""STMicro has been making strategic moves in this segment. Abandoning its dated Nokia and Blackberry businesses years ago, it switched its focus to phone sensors, power management, security, NFC and other wireless technologies.Its FlightSense technology opens the door to the next generation of proximity sensors. For instance, it helps smartphone cameras focus automatically with much greater accuracy.The biggest opportunities may still be ahead. Smartphones have assumed a role as a central device in the larger Internet of Things, becoming as indispensable to industrial end markets as to the average consumer, Krysiak says.IBD'S TAKE: As IBD Stock Checkup notes, STMicro's stellar ratings for Earnings Per Share growth and Relative Price Strength help it earn a spot among the top five stocks in its industry group.Other massive opportunities are seen in autos and factories. The company has gone well beyond its traditional supplies to the automotive industry.Its positioning and car-to-car communication technologies are making self-driving cars possible. It has partnered with Israeli vision-tech pioneer Mobileye (MBLY) on groundbreaking active safety systems. And with vehicles becoming ""almost an internet device,"" in Krysiak's words, and electrified powertrains on the rise, the silicon content of cars has ballooned.STMicro calls these emerging automotive trends ""smart driving"" and now averages 36 parts per vehicle produced in the world, up from 24 just a few years ago.""Smart driving is just starting,"" said Krysiak, who believes the opportunity lies not just in intelligent vehicles themselves, but the entire infrastructure — of power charging systems, parking structures and the like — needed to leverage all that processing power.STMicro also is infusing technology into a sector sometimes viewed as boring — industrials.STMicro chips have made data centers more energy efficient, helped robots become more situation-aware and precise, and brought augmented reality and touchless interfaces to industrial assets.""The last bastion of change in the digitization of everything will be the factory floor,"" Krysiak said. ""We are bringing our vision systems and processing systems there, all leveraging cloud-computing technologies.""STMicro posted net revenue of $6.97 billion in 2016. It spent roughly 19% of that on R&D investments, amid cutthroat industry competition to keep rolling out what the firm describes as ""significantly cheaper, smaller, faster, more reliable and embedded"" products.For fiscal 2017, STMicro is targeting $8 billion in revenue and is now guiding to the high end of its previous forecast range of 12.5%-15.5% growth.While many analysts regard STMicro as a well-diversified company with some unique products, they see challenges too. Baird's Gerra notes that it remains a somewhat cyclical company, since it has a manufacturing component.Slowing car sales in the U.S. and China — two of the biggest automotive markets — are a potential challenge in the future too.Morningstar analyst Brian Colello also sees risks tied to STMicro's in-house manufacturing, with the need for further research reinvestments and ongoing capital expenditures potentially weighing on profits.He raises yellow flags about other aspects of its operations.There are concerns about STMicro's ""ownership by the French and Italian governments, which raises doubts as to whether it is truly focused on operating efficiency,"" he wrote in a recent report.Finally, STMicro hasn't developed a massive scale advantage given its size, with gross margins and operating profits ""below those of other successful pure-play analog chipmakers,"" Colello said.RELATED:Stocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksThe New AmericaChip Stocks & Semiconductor Industry News And Analysis

224,QCOM,"The next-generation Apple (AAPL) smartwatch is likely to address the biggest gripe about the Apple Watch to date: the fact that it needs to be wirelessly tethered to an iPhone for full functionality.XApple is planning to release a version of its smartwatch later this year that connects directly to cellular networks, instead of relying on an iPhone, Bloomberg reported Friday. With a cellular-connected Apple Watch, users will be able to stream music, get the latest news, and send and receive messages without having to carry a phone with them.""It's hard to overstate just how big a deal this could be,"" tech columnist John Gruber said on his Daring Fireball blog.Since the Apple Watch debuted in April 2015, the device has had to be connected to an iPhone via Bluetooth short-range wireless or use Wi-Fi for full functionality.Intel (INTC) will supply the LTE wireless modems for the new Apple Watch, Bloomberg said. Qualcomm (QCOM) has been Apple's main wireless modem supplier for iPhones and iPads, but the two companies are involved in an ugly legal dispute over patent royalties and licensing terms.

226,QCOM,"Northrop Grumman (NOC), best known for the B-2 stealth bomber and Global Hawk drone, also makes millions of semiconductors each year for use in military and civilian products — and competes against commercial chipmakers.XAt foundries in Redondo Beach, Calif., and Linthicum, Md., Northrop produces thousands of different types of semiconductors, including a couple of million monolithic-microwave integrated-circuit units, for use in satellite, air and ground systems.About 95%-98% of the chips required for its defense systems are sourced in-house, but Northrop's chips are also used in commercial airplanes and products used in homes.""We cover everything from in-home up to spacecraft and everything in between,"" said Chris Brown, the company's director of microelectronics products and services, in an interview.While the Pentagon has emphasized using commercial off-the-shelf technologies to help lower acquisition costs and speed up weapons development, there are limits to that approach that encourage Northrop to retain complete control over its chipmaking process.For one, chips from the commercial sector carry security risks, such as vulnerabilities to hacking.While there aren't many security concerns with the hardware of chips themselves, the software and firmware loaded onto the semiconductors have risks, said Francis Sideco, a senior director at IHS Technology.Supply-chain security is another worry, with Sideco pointing to fabless companies. Firms like Nvidia (NVDA) and Broadcom (AVGO) design chips and send them to foundries outside the company to actually make them.""If you don't have full control of how that semiconductor is built and delivered to you, other elements could be inserted that could compromise your security,"" he warned.Also, technology used for Pentagon and NASA missions have particular requirements, with Brown noting that there is a very specific process used to qualifying a device for space. ""No one else has these technologies we have.""But Northrop's commercial offerings help keep costs lower on defense-only products as the additional demand keeps the foundries humming and spreads out costs, said Brown.Roughly half of Northrop's processors are sold to others in the defense sector or to commercial customers, but the top-performing ones are kept for government use only.""That's the core of our business,"" said Brown.Northrop has for several years been working with gallium nitride for its chips, which is more efficient, smaller and lighter than silicon, and found it's good for use in commutation, radar and electronic-warfare systems.Brown wouldn't name Northrop's prime competitors but said their GaN chips compete with others in the space. Toshiba, NXP Semiconductor (NXPI), which is being bought by Qualcomm (QCOM), and Cree (CREE) are leading commercial GaN companies in the market.GaN chips currently account for less than 1% of the total semiconductor market, according to a report by the business consulting firm Grand View Research, but demand is growing from areas like hybrid and electric vehicles along with solar power and satellites.Northrop also has its sights set on 5G applications after the Federal Communications Commission allocated spectrum for 5G mobile broadband use last year — and said it has the capacity to double or triple overall circuit production, depending on demand.""With the FCC reallocation of frequency bands we can leverage the same tech we've been using for government contracts into the commercial marketplace,"" Brown said. ""In the government there are cycles, so in lull times we can build our backlog with these commercial jobs which keeps our cost low and keeps quality high because of constant throughput.""RELATED: Boeing, Apple Could Build A Parallel Internet In Space

230,QCOM,"Key U.S. indexes are keeping solid gains with less than half an hour to go on Friday and look poised to even post modest gains for the week. Apple (AAPL), meanwhile, was fighting for a positive weekly finish and may be showing that its respectable run after the Jan. 6-9 breakout past 118.12 is far from over.While the threat of a military conflict in North Korea helped sour Wall Street's mood early during the July Fourth holiday-shortened trading week, Friday's better than expected report on U.S. payrolls in June (up 222,000, vs. the Econoday consensus view of 170,000) appeared to help enliven the bulls.Meanwhile, Tradeweb noted that the yield spread between the U.S. 2- and 10-year Treasury notes is now at the widest level since mid-May. This is good news for both the finance sector and the general economy.The Nasdaq composite, boosted by strength in the fiber optic gear, semiconductor equipment, fabless chip and various software industries, rallied more than 1%. That's ahead of advances of 0.7% and 0.5% for the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average, respectively. The Russell 2000 rose 0.9%; at 1413, the small-cap benchmark is trying to cut its weekly loss to a fractional amount.Volume was running lower on both main markets vs. the same time Thursday.Apple, up more than 1% to 144.53, traded in light volume. For weeks, the iPhone and iPad giant has swum in a narrow price channel of 142 to 148. However, that's good news for long-term holders in that Apple is still within arm's length of regaining its 50-day moving average. The stock is just 7% below a 156.65 all-time high.In contrast, Qualcomm (QCOM), which has lodged another patent technology infringement lawsuit against Apple, is lagging the market and fellow wireless tech-related names for these reasons:One, the big cap is trading below both the 50- and 200-day moving averages. Two, at 55.41, down more than 1%, Qualcomm is trading more than 22% below its 52-week peak of 71.62. The stock would have to rise a lot more than Apple to stage a breakout.As seen in IBD Stock Checkup, Qualcomm also sports a lowly RS Rating of 19 on a scale of 1 to 99. Apple has improved its rating to 83, meaning it's outrun 83% of all companies in IBD's database over the past 12 months.However, keep an eye on Apple's Accumulation/Distribution Rating, which is currently weak at D-.Wall Street sees Apple's earnings rising 7% in the current fiscal year ending in September to $8.93 a share, then accelerating to an 18% increase in FY 2018. In contrast, analysts see Qualcomm's earnings dropping 4% to $4.25 a share in FY 2017 (also ending in September) and down 8% in FY 2018.IBD's TAKE: Apple has gained more than 32% since it cleared a cup with handle at 118.12 on Jan. 6-9. You can improve your results by mastering this key chart pattern that has showed up among great winners in the U.S. market going back to the late 19th century.

231,QCOM,"The bitter legal dispute between Apple (AAPL) and Qualcomm (QCOM) over patent-licensing terms won't be resolved any time soon as both tech firms have dug in their heels for a long fight, Wall Street analysts said Friday.XThe battle escalated with new legal filings on Thursday. That's when Qualcomm filed patent-infringement complaints against Apple with the U.S. International Trade Commission and in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California. In the new complaints, issued Thursday afternoon, Qualcomm alleges that Apple is infringing six patents with its iPhones.Qualcomm wants the ITC to ban Apple from importing iPhones into the U.S. from its contract manufacturers in Asia. It also is seeking a cease-and-desist order to stop the sale of iPhones already in the U.S., until the patent dispute is settled.""Qualcomm's inventions are at the heart of every iPhone and extend well beyond modem technologies or cellular standards,"" Don Rosenberg, executive vice president and general counsel of Qualcomm, said in a prepared statement.Apple says Qualcomm is demanding a percentage of the total cost of the company's products.""We believe deeply in the value of intellectual property but we shouldn't have to pay them for technology breakthroughs they have nothing to do with,"" Apple's official statement said. ""We've always been willing to pay a fair rate for standard technology used in our products and since they've refused to negotiate reasonable terms we're asking the courts for help.""The six patents cited in the new lawsuits are not the standard-essential modem and cellular-networking patents at the center of Qualcomm's royalty conflict with Apple. These six patents cover smartphone features like wireless-carrier aggregation, graphics processing and signal amplification.IBD'S TAKE: Qualcomm stock has a middling IBD Composite Rating of 57 out of 99. For more information on Qualcomm and its peers, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani said investors should ""brace for a long and ugly battle."" The ITC typically takes 16 to 18 months to make a decision, he said in a report Friday about the Apple-Qualcomm dispute.He also noted that when Samsung got an ITC ruling against Apple in 2013, it was vetoed by President Obama.""The increasingly intense legal battle is likely to be long-drawn given multiple patents, government agencies and geographies involved,"" Daryanani said. ""Ultimately we expect the parties to reach a settlement for agreeable economics, though timing and terms are uncertain. Meanwhile, investors should prepare to see more pressure tactics from both parties.""On Jan. 20, Apple sued Qualcomm, alleging that the chipmaker unfairly used its monopoly position to impose unfavorable terms for the use of its patents and hindered its ability to use competing products from vendors such as Intel (INTC).On May 17, Qualcomm sued four Apple suppliers – Compal Electronics, Foxconn Technology, Pegatron and Wistron – for not paying royalties after Apple stopped reimbursing those payments starting in the March quarter.On June 20, Apple broadened its lawsuit and alleged that some Qualcomm patents are invalid and that its business model violates patent law.In the latest salvo, Qualcomm is emphasizing that it supplies more intellectual property for smartphones than just essential communications patents. For instance, one of the patents in the new filings covers a technology for battery life conservation during high-speed data transmissions, Morgan Stanley analyst James Faucette said in a report Friday.""It's almost definitely going to be a prolonged legal fight,"" Faucette said.RELATED:Qualcomm Sues Apple Device Manufacturers For Breach Of Contract

233,QCOM,"Stocks stuck very close to home on Thursday as mixed economic data and earnings reports frayed any attempts to build momentum.Better-than-expected weekly jobless claims and June consumer confidence numbers were positive, but a sharp drop in manufacturing growth reported by the Philadelphia Fed before the open helped stoke investor concerns. Investor response to earnings reports cut sharply in both directions, although mostly in soft trade, throughout the session.The result gave the Nasdaq a technical win: another new high and its 10th straight gain. But the increase was less than 0.1%, and in weak trade — no mean feat with Check Point Software (CHKP), TripAdvisor (TRIP) and Qualcomm (QCOM) all turning in broad losses, and Apple (AAPL), Netflix (NFLX) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) ending with minor losses on the day.Drugmakers Mylan (MYL) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) led the Nasdaq 100.

The stock has fallen below its 59.10 buy point, but the breakout at that entry remains in play.Home Depot (HD) fell 4%, ratcheting up the drag on the Dow. The catalyst appeared to be an agreement by Sears Holdings (SHLD) to sell its respected Kenmore-brand home appliances via Amazon.com (AMZN). The news sent Sears shares to a nearly 11% gain. Amazon sketched out a 0.2% advance.Macom Technology Solutions (MTSI) led the IBD 50, up more than 3% in above-average trade. That was sufficient to take out a new high, although shares were already extended after an early July rebound from the 10-week moving average. The chipmaker plans to report its fiscal third-quarter results on Aug. 1.On the down side, Floor & Decor (FND) tumbled 6% in fast trade, falling back below its 10-week moving average. The company priced a 10.7 million-share follow-on offering at 40, just below Wednesday's closing price. The stock remains 83% above its April IPO price.RELATED: These 2 Financials Are In Buy Range With Earnings TonightAmazon Teams Up With Sears, And A New Retail Group TumblesPayPal Stock At Record High On JPMorgan Deal As Online Payment Sizzles

But Whirlpool (WHR) and major sellers of appliances Home Depot, Lowe's (LOW) and Best Buy (BBY) were hit. Home improvement chains Home Depot and Lowe's had been seen as Amazon-proof, or at least Amazon-resistant.

Honeywell shares rose Friday, retaking a buy point.RELATED:General Electric Stock Dives On Earnings OutlookAmerican Express beat on the top and bottom lines, though provisions for losses jumped 26% due to loan-portfolio growth and a rise in the rate for lending write-offs. Visa earnings also topped, with strong cross-border travel – helped by the stronger dollar – and global payment volumes driving results, according to Mizuho analyst Thomas McCrohan. The company also hiked its full-year revenue growth outlook above views. Visa and American Express, both Dow components, rose 2.8% and 0.4%, respectively, with both still in buy range.TD Ameritrade (AMTD) stock broke out from a long consolidation on July 18 as the online broker beat on both the top and bottom lines, even as industry trading fees for stocks and ETFs have plunged this year.

Weaker trading and net-interest income also hurt Bank of America (BAC), though Fed rate hikes have helped the bank and it said it expected net-interest income to rise in Q3. Morgan Stanley (MS) reported that trading revenue fell, but less so than rivals. JPMorgan (JPM) and Citigroup (C) have also signaled caution amid slow loan growth and longer-term bond yields, which can indicate flagging confidence over the chances for long-term economic gains. Morgan Stanley cleared a buy point while Goldman undercut its 50-day and 200-day moving averages.Check Point Software (CHKP) reported better-than-expected second-quarter earnings on Thursday, but gave weak guidance for the current Q3. Check Point tumbled 7.2% that day, falling below its 50-day moving average. Check Point on Wednesday briefly topped a buy point but closed below that trigger.

236,QCOM,"Plans by Amazon.com (AMZN) to make a line of smartphones is about its passage to India — in a battle to dominate the e-commerce market after having failed in China, says Edison Investment Research.The big dent in profits in Amazon's overseas operations, revealed in its first-quarter earnings report, is largely due to its determination not to lose India to Alibaba (BABA), as it did China, wrote Edison analyst Richard Windsor in a research brief Wednesday.""Alibaba wiped the floor with Amazon in China,"" Windsor wrote, ""and with developed markets maturing, Amazon's long-term growth is at least partially dependent on history not repeating itself in India.""Like China, India is heavily dependent on mobile devices and not fixed landlines. To win the e-commerce wars in India, says Windsor, Amazon's plan will be to offer good smartphones at low prices, with the hope they will be used for e-commerce transactions with Amazon.According to a report from India-based Gadgets 360, an affiliate of Indian TV station NDTV, Amazon is testing a new line of company-branded smartphones, known internally as ""Ice."" The smartphones would run the latest version of the Android operating system and include a variety of Google applications, such as Gmail and Google Play, making the phones fully compliant with the Google ecosystem by Alphabet (GOOGL). Amazon has not commented on the report.""The Ice device portfolio could serve as a way to encourage users to do their online shopping with Amazon rather than Flipkart,"" Windsor said.""Google has no e-commerce offering to speak of and so Amazon can produce Google ecosystem devices (which Indian users demand) and at the same time install its shopping apps, optimize them and set them by default,"" Windsor wrote.IBD'S TAKE: While Amazon faces increased competition overseas, the stock has been outperforming much of the market. Amazon, an IBD Leaderboard stock, has a strong IBD Composite Rating of 97 out of a possible 99. The stock hit a record high on Tuesday.Amazon stock was up 0.7% to 1,010.07 in the stock market today. Alphabet was up 0.5% to 1,001.59.Amazon's initial attempt at making smartphones, the Fire Phone, was a massive flop, attributable in part to high prices, gimmicky software and apps that users didn't want. Amazon quit the Fire Phone in 2015.The new line of phones would reportedly come with the latest Qualcomm (QCOM) Snapdragon processor and be priced under $100, said Gadgets 360, saying the information came from two sources familiar with the matter.""Hence, we can see Amazon selling Ice devices at 0% gross margins in order to win over more affluent Indian users to its shopping proposition at the expense of Flipkart & Co.,"" Windsor wrote.Flipkart is the e-commerce leader in India with a 35% market share, followed by Amazon at 23% and Snapdeal at 15%. Flipkart, founded by two former Amazon employees, recently received a $1.4 billion investment from Microsoft (MSFT), eBay (EBAY) and China's Tencent Holdings (TCEHY). Flipkart is reportedly in talks to acquire Snapdeal.""Softbank, the backer of Flipkart, is keen for it to merge with Snapdeal which, if perfectly executed, would give the combined entity 50% share,"" said Windsor. The combination of Flipkart and Snapdeal could be enough to defeat Amazon in India, says Windsor.Amazon has pledged to invest $5 billion in Amazon India, which it launched in 2013.RELATED:Android Passes Windows As Top Internet Operating SystemAmazon Reportedly Ends Talks To Acquire Stake In Middle East E-Com Leader

""In our view, 3D sensing might evolve into two groups: 1) a front camera for facial recognition, and 2) a rear camera for 3D scanning. We believe online shopping, facial recognition, and gaming will likely be three key 3D-sensing applications.""Lumentum's optical scanning product is likely to be popular with Apple rivals, he said.Viavi Solutions should maintain its leading position in optical filters over the next two years, Zhang said.""We are positive on Viavi as we believe the business is not heavily exposed to the volatility of the optical market and remains a 3D-sensing market leader, which we believe has not been fully reflected in the stock price,"" Zhang said.Apple has booked capacity of 150 million optical filter units from Viavi in 2018, he said. Plus, many Chinese smartphone makers have picked Viavi as their sole optical filter supplier, he said.IBD'S TAKE: Lumentum Holdings is currently ranked No. 1 on the IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks.Optical component supplier Finisar (FNSR) also is believed to have a share of the business for laser modules for the depth sensor in the iPhone 8, Zhang said.Chipmakers hoping to capitalize on the 3D-sensing smartphone trend include STMicroelectronics (STM), Qualcomm (QCOM) and Himax Technologies (HIMX), he said.RELATED:Lumentum 'Best Play' On Apple 3D Sensor Market, Price Target HikedFinisar Stock Pops On Expectations It Will Supply Apple iPhones

244,QCOM,"Baidu (BIDU) will use Nvidia (NVDA) tech in its cloud-computing platforms and self-driving vehicles. The pact, announced Wednesday, expands an existing partnership between the two tech companies and fuels momentum for autonomous technologies.Autonomous or self-driving technology is too complicated and too important to do it yourself. At least that seems to be the message as automotive companies and technology firms such as General Motors (GM), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Intel (INTC) form self-driving alliances as they try to figure out where they need one another to fill in gaps in expertise.The logic behind Detroit-Silicon Valley pacts is straightforward. Automakers know how to mass produce, distribute and market vehicles, as well as manage tens of thousands of factory workers, whereas tech giants have the edge on electronics, crunching data and rapid innovation.Autonomous and partially autonomous cars will account for 12%-13% of global vehicle sales by 2025, representing a market for those features of roughly $42 billion, the Boston Consulting Group has estimated.Here is a rundown of key ""driverless car"" alliances:XChipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) and Chinese Internet company Baidu (BIDU) jointly announced Wednesday that they will work together on artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to power cloud data centers, self-driving cars and consumers devices such as home assistants.Notably, the agreement calls for Nvidia's Volta GPUS to be used in Baidu Cloud and its Drive PX supercomputer to be used in Baidu's self-driving car efforts. Baidu simultaneously announced it now has over 50 partners on board its Apollo program, which aims to develop self-driving cars with major Chinese carmakers.Shares of both companies rallied more than 2% on the stock market today.In June, Nvidia announced it is extending self-driving partnerships with European automakers Volkswagen (VLKAY) and Volvo, as well as car-parts maker ZF. The companies will work on advanced artificial intelligence systems for next-generation autonomous technologies.In August 2016, Nvidia and Chinese search giant company Baidu (BIDU) agreed to build a cloud-based computing platform for self-driving cars. It was described as one that would be available for purchase by automakers for their own self-driving vehicles.Apple (AAPL) is leasing six cars from a Hertz (HTZ) subsidiary for testing autonomous software, reports in late June said.While Apple recently confirmed it is working on technology for self-driving cars, it was not clear whether the company will make its own car or just produce the technology for automakers. Reports last year said Apple tried to partner with Daimler and BMW but was rejected.Alphabet and car-rental company Avis Budget (CAR) announced in late June they will work together on self-driving cars. Alphabet's self-driving car unit, Waymo, will rely on Avis to service and store its fleet of Chrysler Pacifica minivans as part of a pilot program in Phoenix, Ariz.In May, Alphabet's Waymo said it would partner with Lyft. Details of the tie-up are sketchy, but it threatens a ride-sharing rival Uber. Waymo is also engaged in a legal spat with Uber.Uber has partnered with German automaker Daimler AG (DDAIF) and Japanese automaker Toyota Motors (TM) for new mobility solutions. It has also reportedly chased self-driving deals with Tesla (TSLA), Fiat Chrysler (FCAU), General Motors (GM), Ford Motor (F) and others.Meanwhile, in January 2017, General Motors invested in Lyft to spur deployment of its cars in autonomous ride-sharing fleets. In February 2017, Ford said it would invest $1 billion in an obscure startup, Argo AI, to build fully self-driving cars. In April 2017, Fiat Chrysler delivered minivans for Waymo-Alphabet's self-driving program.In mid-May, BMW Group, Intel (INTC) and Mobileye (MBLY) announced that they will partner with Delphi Automotive (DLPH) to bring autonomous driving solutions to multiple automakers.Delphi will play a key role in integrating the solution delivered by BMW, Intel and Mobileye into OEM (original equipment manufacturer) vehicle architectures, the companies said in a joint news release. It also may provide components such as sensors and help with customizations to help vehicle brands differentiate themselves.The Delphi partnership is seen as likely to benefit smaller car companies lacking resources to build their own systems.Mobileye, which produces camera-based driver-assistance systems, joined forces in July 2016 with Intel and BMW to make self-driving cars a reality in about five years. In August last year, Delphi and Mobileye teamed up to make turnkey autonomous systems for auto and truck makers.Then in March 2017, Intel decided to acquire Mobileye in a $15 billion deal, capitalizing on the Israeli tech firm's driver-assistance and anti-collision expertise.Delphi said in early May it would focus more aggressively on autonomous driving and would spin off its powertrain unit.In October 2016, Qualcomm (QCOM) agreed to acquire NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), the largest automotive chip supplier, for $47 billion. The mega chip deal is expected create the industry's largest portfolio of sensors, networking and other elements vital to autonomous driving.Elon Musk's Tesla combines auto-manufacturing expertise and technological expertise into one package. The electric carmaker touts its vehicles as having the hardware needed for full self-driving capability, while also testing autonomous technology on the roads, with plans to take it mainstream.Tesla counts Nvidia, whose chips act as the brains of self-driving cars, as a partner. Tesla also partnered with Mobileye, until the two companies broke up over issues tied to Tesla's Autopilot hands-free technology.But chief executive Musk is largely on his own as far as self-driving goals go.RELATED:Tesla Slammed By Goldman Sachs As Sell Rating ReiteratedGoogle's Self-Driving Car Deal Boosts These Rental Car LeadersGoogle's Waymo, Uber Rival Lyft Team Up On Self-Driving CarsDelphi Breaks Out On Earnings, Spinoff In Shift To Self-Driving Future

245,QCOM,"If you're in the National Basketball Association playoffs, you want Steph Curry or LeBron James on your team. If you're managing a retirement account or taxable portfolio, why not tap into the Fidelity Investments' brain trust, which includes an army of analysts? Knowing cumulative stock moves in Fidelity's many mutual funds can help you choose your own buys and sells.Not all Fidelity funds make the same buys and sells, but it's instructive to see which leading stocks Fidelity overall bet more of its shareholders' money on the first quarter and where it lightened its weightings. Normally you'd have to track down and then sift through Securities and Exchange Commission filings by each of Fidelity's 358 stock and balanced funds. But CFRA, an independent research firm, has done that and crunched the numbers for you already.What CFRA found is that Fidelity's biggest sector weights were in information technology and consumer discretionary. By the end of Q1, Fidelity had nearly 27% of its shareholders' money at work in tech. It had more than 15% of its shareholders cash placed in consumer discretionary stocks.""Heading into 2017, economically sensitive information technology stocks were poised to benefit from a risk-on environment,"" said Todd Rosenbluth, CFRA's director of ETF and mutual fund research. ""Further, Fidelity offers a number of growth-oriented strategies that tend to favor tech stocks.""Among Fidelity's 75 largest stock positions across all of its stock and balanced portfolios, PayPal (PYPL) and Qualcomm (QCOM) were tech-sector stocks in which the Fidelity complex increased its Q1 share-count percentage the most.Fidelity added 6.4 million shares of PayPal, for a 16.8% increase. It added 4.3 million shares of Qualcomm, for an 8.3% hike.Fidelity's $110.7 billion Contrafund (FCNTX) — the firm's largest stock mutual fund — and $15.5 billion Magellan (FMAGX) were among the funds investing in PayPal as of their latest disclosures.Fidelity's $14.8 billion OTC (FOCPX) and $30.5 billion Balanced (FBALX) funds were holders of Qualcomm.Still, Fidelity made an even bigger percentage increase in its share count in LyondellBasell Industries (LYB). Adding 5.2 million shares across its funds, Fidelity's share count jumped nearly 31%.The Netherlands-based company makes chemicals and polymers that are used packaging, home furnishings and automotive components. A materials manufacturer like that stands to benefit from any global expansion in GDP, such as the one that appears to be underway.Fidelity's Magellan, Balanced and OTC funds were investors in LyondellBasell.Drugmaker Amgen (AMGN) had the third-largest Q1 percentage boost in share count by Fidelity funds. The 2.7 million share boost was a 9.9% increase.Amgen is a leading seller of LDL cholesterol-battling drugs. A judge recently sided with Amgen in a patent lawsuit against Regeneron Pharmaceutical (REGN) and Sanofi (SNY). The ruling is under appeal.Fidelity's $9.4 billion Select Biotechnology (FBIOX) and $21 billion Blue Chip Growth (FBGRX) funds were Amgen holders.Fidelity's fourth-largest share-count percentage hike was for Charter Communications (CHTR). Fidelity's increase of nearly 800,000 shares was a 9.8% boost.Charter is the No. 1 stock in IBD's Telecom Services-Integrated industry group. Earnings per share rose 131% in the latest quarter on a 302% rise in sales. Its three-year sales growth rate is 54%.IBD'S TAKE: See how Charter's additional, easy-to-understand fundamental and technical data stack up against that of rivals at IBD's Stock Checkup.Fidelity's $7.4 billion Dividend Growth (FDGFX) and $1.6 billion Trend funds were Charter investors.Fidelity's build up of Qualcomm shares was the fund family's fifth-biggest increase. Its boosts in Citigroup (C) and Goldman Sachs (GS) were its next two largest percentage increases.Fidelity boosted its share count in Citigroup by 5.9 million shares, a 7.5% increase. Its step up of about 550,000 shares in Goldman Sachs was also a 7.5% increase.RELATED:Are Fidelity's Recent Stocks Buys And Sells Retirement Account Hot Sauce?P-s-s-st!

248,QCOM,"Apple (AAPL) stock tumbled Friday on a news report that the wireless chips in its upcoming iPhone 8 series handsets will have slower data download speeds than rival devices on the market.Apple fell as much as 5.8% in intraday trading on the stock market today. It ended the regular session down 3.9% to 148.98, rebounding somewhat and finding support at its 50-day moving average. Other major technology stocks also took a beating Friday, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq index falling 1.8% for the day.Bloomberg reported Friday that Apple's 11th-generation smartphones, expected to be announced in September, will fall short of the gigabit-per-second data speed that the latest wireless networks from AT&T (T) and Verizon (VZ) are touting.Apple is moving to dual source the wireless modem chips it uses in its iPhones because of its legal fight with supplier Qualcomm (QCOM) over patent licensing and royalty terms. Qualcomm has a modem capable of the 1-gigabit download speeds, but the other rumored supplier, Intel (INTC), does not. Intel is working on a modem with the same capability but it won't be ready for the new iPhone, Bloomberg said.IBD'S TAKE: Apple has an IBD Composite Rating of 91, meaning it has outperformed 91% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months. For more information on Apple stock, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.Apple could decide to use only Qualcomm modems for the new iPhones, but that's in doubt because of the contentious legal battle between the two companies, Bloomberg said.Apple is likely to stick with Qualcomm modems for some models of the new iPhone and use Intel modems for others, Bloomberg said.Samsung's flagship Galaxy S8 smartphone has Qualcomm's X16 LTE modem and can keep up with the top speeds of the major wireless networks.RELATED:Apple Solves iPhone 8 Technical Snag, Production Still DelayedFANG Stocks, Apple Take Hit; Goldman Sachs Calls Out 'Air Pocket'Fear Gauge Flashed Extreme Bullishness Just Before Tech SelloffQualcomm Sues Apple Device Manufacturers For Breach Of Contract

249,QCOM,"Recent device analysis by Chipworks points to several semiconductor winners, Susquehanna Financial Group said in a report Wednesday.Those winners include Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM); Texas Instruments (TXN); ON Semiconductor (ON); and NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), which is being purchased by Qualcomm (QCOM), Susquehanna analyst Christopher Rolland said in a report.Maxim gained significant market share in audio amplifiers in the first half of the year, helped by contract wins at Huawei, the giant Chinese tech firm. It also is being used in Samsung's flagship Galaxy S8 smartphone, Susquehanna said.Texas Instruments has been gaining power-management chip content in Chinese smartphones. It also won business in security cameras, game consoles, solid-state drives, routers and set-top boxes, the investment bank said.ON Semi has gained in power-management chips in PCs, handsets and other devices as well as in rapid-charge components in handsets. Plus, ON Semi is benefiting from the growth of devices with USB Type-C connections, Susquehanna said.NXP has been dominating the near-field communications chip market. It captured about 80% of NFC sockets in the first half of 2017, Susquehanna said.Ambarella (AMBA) stock dived below its 50-day moving average, a key support level, in bearish fashion on Wednesday after the maker of video-processing chips gave disappointing sales guidance for the current quarter late Tuesday.Ambarella reported better-than-expected fiscal first-quarter results, but offered weak revenue guidance for its fiscal Q2.The Santa Clara, Calif.-based company earned 39 cents a share excluding items, up 15% year over year, on sales of $64.1 million, up 12%, in the quarter ended April 30. Analysts expected 36 cents and $63.5 million.For the current quarter ending July 31, Ambarella expects revenue of $69 million to $72 million, below Wall Street's consensus estimate of $72.35 million. The midpoint of its guidance would be an increase of 8% year over year.IBD'S TAKE: The IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks now features nine chip-industry players including Nvidia and Microchip Technology.Most of the revenue shortfall in fiscal Q2 is related to weakness in its drone camera business.Ambarella is working to diversify its business from action cameras and drone cameras for customers like GoPro (GPRO) and DJI and into more internet-enabled security cameras, law-enforcement cameras and automotive cameras.Ambarella stock was down 10.25% to 53.60 on the stock market today. The stock peaked at 129.19 in July 2015 when GoPro wearable action cameras were a hot item.Investment bank Stifel reiterated its buy rating on Ambarella stock, but trimmed its price target to 64 from 65 on Wednesday.Needham maintained its hold rating on Ambarella on Wednesday.""Despite a weaker outlook for drones, the rest of Ambarella's business is performing strongly,"" Needham analyst Quinn Bolton said in a report. ""The company saw strong revenue growth in IP security cameras, both in professional and home monitoring, body-worn police cameras, and auto (equipment manufacturer) video recorders. … Additionally, Ambarella is seeing strong initial traction for 360-degree cameras and virtual-reality solutions, but notes it is still too early to forecast the size of this opportunity.""RELATED:This IBD 50 Chip Stock Just Notched A Record High, Here's Why

250,QCOM,"Apple's (AAPL) iPhone 8 smartphone hasn't been announced yet, but analysts are already picking winners and losers among component suppliers for the rumored device.Rosenblatt Securities analyst Jun Zhang on Friday predicted that Cypress Semiconductor (CY), Dialog Semiconductor, Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM) and Qorvo (QRVO) would be content-gainers in Apple's next-generation handset.Component-share losers in the iPhone 8 likely will include Analog Devices (ADI), Cirrus Logic (CRUS) and Qualcomm (QCOM), he said.Cypress could gain a USB type-C driver in the handset, Zhang said. Maxim likely has a design win for the power-management chip for the OLED display, he said. Qorvo will gain content, but at a lower gross margin, he said.Qualcomm is likely to be a loser as Apple shifts more to Intel (INTC) wireless chips. Apple and Qualcomm are engaged in a nasty legal battle over wireless-patent royalties and terms.Cirrus Logic is expected to lose power amplifier share to Maxim, Zhang said. And Analog Devices lost the Force Touch component business to a competitor for the OLED iPhone.Apple is expected to introduce the iPhone 8 in September, along with iPhone 7S handsets, which are upgraded versions of the current iPhone 7 devices. The iPhone 8 is likely to be in very short supply initially because of production snags that Apple's contract manufacturers have experienced. Component suppliers have had trouble integrating the fingerprint security sensor into the OLED display, analysts say.The iPhone 8 is expected to be Apple's biggest smartphone redesign since the iPhone 6, which came out in September 2014. The iPhone 8 is rumored to feature a 5.8-inch borderless OLED screen, glass-sandwich design, wireless charging and augmented-reality capability. Apple is expected to replace the physical home button with a virtual on-screen button, which will allow for a larger display.Many Wall Street analysts expect the iPhone 8 — Apple's 11th-generation handset and 10th-anniversary smartphone — to kick off a ""supercycle"" of upgrade purchases among iPhone users.Earlier this month, Pacific Crest Securities identified chipmakers Broadcom (AVGO), Cirrus Logic and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) as three companies likely to benefit from the release of the iPhone 8.Audio-chip maker Cirrus Logic has the highest exposure to Apple of the three companies spotlighted by Pacific Crest. Cirrus gets about 75% of its revenue from Apple.Broadcom is best positioned to make content gains in the iPhone 8 with its radio-frequency, Wi-Fi and wireless-charging chips, Pacific Crest said. Broadcom gets 15% to 20% of its revenue from Apple.Skyworks also is seen making content gains in the new iPhone, Pacific Crest said. Skyworks gets about 40% of its revenue from Apple.On Wednesday, investment bank Cowen said Apple's contract manufacturers might not reach mass production of the iPhone 8 until late October or early November, three months later than usual for the annual iPhone update.

Their strong showings also gave fellow FANG stock Facebook (FB) a 1% boost. Facebook reports next week. Alphabet, which has been in a buy zone and at all-time highs, is likely to jump beyond the 5% buy zone. Amazon should pop beyond its all-time high, and will clear a three-weeks-tight pattern of 923.82, which can offer a follow-on entry.However, Intel, which is a Dow component, lost nearly 4% as sales fell just short of views due to weakness in its data center market.Qualcomm, which has been insisting repeatedly that its business relationship with Apple would continue despite their legal fight, said Apple will not pay royalties in the current Q3. It slashed its Q3 adjusted EPS outlook to 75-85 cents from its recent guidance of 90 cents to $1.15. It also cut its revenue targets.Qualcomm shares sank 3.4%. Apple, a Dow component, dipped 0.2%.Among other notable earnings, General Motors (GM) topped views Friday morning, Microsoft (MSFT) sales fell short Thursday night while Starbucks missed on revenue once again.

If the major holdings of the fund are any indication, the fund could be hitting more new highs.Broadcom (AVGO), the largest component with more than 8% of the portfolio, just broke out of a flat base. Nvidia (NVDA) roared higher on a strong earnings report and is forming the right side of a base. Its superb results sparked a rally in semiconductor stocks.Intel (INTC) is forming a base. Micron Technology (MU) is forming a flat base and is nearing the 29.97 buy point. Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM) is trying to break out of a base. ON Semiconductor (ON) is well along with a new base also. Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) is speeding higher from a breakout May 2.Those are appealing patterns, and bode well for the ETF as a whole.To be sure, there are some clunkers in the portfolio. Qualcomm (QCOM), Cree (CREE) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) are in sharp price corrections.If the fund's SOXX symbol looks familiar, it's because the ETF tracks the Philadelphia semiconductor index, a popular gauge of the chip industry that often goes by the shorthand ""SOX.""  It includes companies that make chips and others that make equipment for their manufacturing.No doubt, chips have been a hot sector. The ETF has rallied about 50% since it started making new highs a year ago. The big advance itself can be a liability.

253,QCOM,"Qualcomm (QCOM) has fired back at a lawsuit from Apple (AAPL) with its own countersuit, claiming that Apple covered up how iPhone 7s equipped with its chips outperformed those with Intel (INTC) chips.Apple ""acted to prevent Qualcomm from revealing to consumers the extent to which iPhones with Qualcomm's chip sets outperformed iPhones with Intel's chip sets,"" Qualcomm said in a countersuit filed late Monday in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California.Qualcomm also alleged that Apple lied to regulators to spur investigations of the wireless chipmaker. Apple on Jan. 20 filed a lawsuit vs. Qualcomm over its technology licensing practices.""It's difficult to tell what will come of the legal battle,"" said Tim Long, a BMO Capital Markets analyst in a report. ""We think Qualcomm will be able to defend itself against many, if not all, of Apple's claims, but expect these cases to last for a year or two. It's unclear if there will be escalation to the point where significant royalty payments are withheld. Our industry sources tell us that the Qualcomm chip is superior technically to Intel's. However, we believe Apple cares less about modem performance, and Intel share could move higher in the next iPhone given the relationship issues.""Qualcomm stock fell 2.1% to end trading at 55.35 on the stock market today. Apple dipped 1.1% to 141.63, still in range from a 141.12 buy point.

The 10-year Treasury yield continued to slide, hitting its lowest level since November.United Airlines CEO Oscar Munoz apologized multiple times after a video of Chicago police dragging an elderly Asian man off an overbooked flight sparked outcry on social media. Weibo users in China questioned if the incident was racially motivated and called for a boycott of the airline. In an earlier a memo to employees, Munoz blamed the passenger for being ""disruptive and belligerent"" and said that United had ""followed established procedures."" In March, the carrier came under fire for turning away two teenagers for wearing leggings while flying under a special friends-and-family ticket.United Airlines shares fell 2.55% for the week, not much more than the airline stock group.RELATED:Delta Air Lines (DAL) reported mixed first-quarter results but forecast positive Q2 unit revenue, an important efficiency metric Wall Street has long wished would improve. As airlines confront higher fuel and labor costs, Delta said that it expected ""the entirety of our 2017 margin pressure"" to have occurred during Q1. The carrier said the roughly 4,000 flight cancellations that resulted from thunderstorms around Atlanta would cost it $125 million in Q2 pretax income, but it said it was not understaffed. In light of the forcible removal of a passenger from a packed United Airlines flight, Delta said extra regulation wasn't needed and that it handled overbookings better than rivals.Delta shares rose 4% intraday Wednesday but reversed to close slightly lower, and continued to slide Thursday, closing at their lowest levels since Nov. 9.RELATED:Apple's internal chip development efforts grabbed the spotlight, raising investor worries that some iPhone suppliers could be phased out after a report said the Dow-industrials tech giant will replace power management devices made by Germany's Dialog Semiconductor with in-house technology, possibly as soon as 2019. The Dialog report followed U.K.-based Imagination Technologies' warning to investors that Apple could replace its graphics chips in iPhones. A Pacific Crest analyst said Apple is unlikely to develop its own radio frequency or audio chips for iPhones. Shares in Qorvo (QRVO), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Cirrus Logic (CRUS) sold off.In a countersuit, Qualcomm (QCOM) claimed Apple covered up how iPhone 7s equipped with its chips outperformed those with Intel (INTC) chips.

OPEC's production fell by 153,000 barrels per day in March, according to secondary sources in the cartel's monthly oil market report. Saudi Arabia said its production fell to 9.9 million barrels per day, but secondary sources said its output actually rose. The International Energy Agency said global crude supplies are nearly balanced due to the OPEC-led cuts. The Energy Information Administration said weekly U.S. oil stockpiles unexpectedly fell, but U.S. production hit a 20-month high. Looking ahead, the EIA expects gasoline to average $2.46 per gallon during the peak summer driving season vs. $2.23  last year. The EIA lowered its 2017 and 2018 outlook on crude prices and raised its forecast on U.S. output.RELATED:A surge in Tesla stock Monday briefly made it the No. 1 carmaker in the U.S. by market capitalization, passing General Motors.

258,QCOM,"Two investment banks raised their price targets on shares of chip gear maker Applied Materials (AMAT) on Monday, three days ahead of the company's fiscal second-quarter earnings report.Needham reiterated its buy rating on Applied Materials and upped its price target to 50 from 43. Stifel maintained its buy rating and raised its price target to 50 from 42.Applied Materials stock was up 2% to 44.31 on the stock market today. In intraday trading, it notched a record high of 44.42.""With recent positive reports by peers and suppliers, we believe investors generally expect an upbeat fiscal Q2 report from Applied Materials,"" Needham analyst Edwin Mok said in a report. ""We believe the buy side already expects AMAT to raise guidance, but we are confident that the outlook will be strong enough to sustain the stock price.""Even though Applied Materials stock is up about 35% year to date, Mok thinks the stock has more room to run. The semiconductor equipment maker is benefiting from strong chip industry trends and a growing display equipment business, he said.The chip industry is ""only in the fourth inning"" of its current growth cycle, Mok said.Stifel analyst Patrick Ho believes Applied Materials can deliver sustained growth over the next several years, regardless of the industry environment.IBD'S TAKE: Applied Materials and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing are two of eight chip-industry stocks on the IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks.""The company has repositioned itself in both the semi and display equipment markets where it is not only favorably positioned in many of the process segments where it plays but also growing its share within the overall framework."" Ho said in a report.Santa Clara, Calif.-based Applied Materials is seen posting its third straight quarter of triple-digit earnings growth when it reports fiscal second-quarter results after the market close Thursday.Analysts expect Applied Materials to earn 76 cents a share, up 124% year over year, on sales of $3.54 billion, up 45%.For the third quarter, Wall Street is modeling Applied Materials to earn 66 cents a share, up 32%, on sales of $3.32 billion, up 18%.Credit Suisse lowered its rating on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) to neutral from outperform on valuation.Taiwan Semi faces headwinds from excess inventory, slower China smartphone growth, Qualcomm (QCOM) shifting its business to Samsung, and lower gross margins from the 10-nanometer ramp and foreign exchange impact in the second half of the year, Credit Suisse said.The bank also believes that a strong Apple (AAPL) iPhone 8 production cycle has been factored into expectations for Taiwan Semi.U.S. shares of Taiwan Semiconductor were down 0.9% to 35.06.

259,QCOM,"Ask Wall Street analysts to name possible catalysts for a rise in big-cap technology stocks like Apple (AAPL) and Cisco Systems (CSCO), and near the top on most lists would be Trump administration plans to allow companies to bring foreign profits into the U.S. at a reduced tax rate.Analysts say cash brought back could be a piggy bank for company stock repurchases or acquisitions. Problem is, President Trump's economic agenda has been stalled amid White House drama.The proposed changes on ""repatriated"" cash are part of a bigger Trump tax reform package. Randall Stephenson, AT&T's (T) CEO, says tax reform can make it through Congress.""A lot of people are getting pessimistic because of a lot of the noise in Washington right now that tax reform may not be achieved,"" Stephenson said at a JPMorgan tech conference on May 23. ""I am still optimistic something can still get done … bundling tax reform with an infrastructure bill would be big. I think it's achievable.""Even so, one worry is that the overseas ""tax holiday"" for tech firms may not turn out as the bonanza it's made out to be. That depends on whether legislation puts conditions on how money could be spent and creates enforcement mechanisms.Rather than see the money go toward company stock buybacks or acquisitions, Trump and Congress could steer money toward job creation and capital spending, says a UBS analyst.""If the (Trump administration) wants to really drive inward investments within the U.S. there might have to be some sort of mandated use of cash, maybe to spend it on (capital expenditures). As yet, we do not know,"" UBS analyst Geoff Robinson said in a report.There's reason to think Robinson might be on the right track.""There's trillions of dollars offshore. We want to get that back into America,"" Gary Cohn, Trump's chief economic advisor, said in a recent interview. ""We want the companies to bring the money back and put it back into the economy. We want them to create jobs.""Cash-rich tech companies like Apple, Microsoft (MSFT), Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and Cisco currently would pay a 35% tax on so-called ""repatriated earnings."" Rather than take the tax hit, they've kept the money overseas.President Trump has proposed a one-time tax of 10% on offshore earnings while the Republican-controlled House has proposed a lower 8.5% rate.The overseas tax-break that Congress passed in 2004 was called the American Jobs Creation Act, but didn't do much to stimulate the economy, analysts say. The AJCA taxed repatriated earnings at a 5.25% rate.The top five firms in bringing back cash in 2004 were drug companies Pfizer (PFE) and Merck (MRK), as well as Hewlett-Packard, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and IBM (IBM). According to the IRS, $312 billion was brought back in all.However, only 10% of companies eligible to bring back cash in 2004 did so, says Richard Lane, an analyst at Moody's Investor Service. Many companies kept cash overseas because of AJCA requirements, he said.The AJCA required companies to reinvest tax savings in worker hiring and training, infrastructure, research and development and capital projects. According to UBS, however, ""Funds in 2004's repatriation may have been earmarked for capital investment but ultimately were spent in large part on share repurchases.""UBS says that happened because the AJCA did not include a ""tracking mechanism"" so the government could audit companies and gauge compliance. The Trump administration could put better enforcement mechanisms in place.S&P 500 companies have more than $2.6 trillion in overseas cash. Some of that may be needed to continue funding foreign operations.The companies currently with the most overseas cash are Apple, Microsoft, Cisco, Google and Oracle (ORCL), Moody's says.While Cisco has stated any cash brought back to the U.S. could be used for reducing debt on its books, analysts have other ideas.If a tax holiday is approved, BMO Capital Markets said in a report that it ""expects Cisco and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) to focus more on acquisitions, while Apple and smaller companies would likely lean more toward capital return.""In the case of Apple and Cisco, some analysts envision enough cash being brought back to fund ""transformative"" deals. Apple has about $250 billion in cash, growing at about $50 billion a year. About 90% of Apple's cash is overseas. A one-time, 10% repatriation tax would give Apple some $220 billion for acquisitions or buybacks, Citigroup analyst Jim Suva said in a report. Suva speculated that Apple could buy large companies such as Netflix (NFLX), Walt Disney (DIS) or Electronic Arts (EA).Cisco, meanwhile, could bring back up to $56 billion in cash from overseas, analysts say. In a report, Credit Suisse speculates that enterprise software providers ServiceNow (NOW), Splunk (SPLK), or computer security firm Palo Alto Networks (PANW) could be on Cisco's shopping list. Pacific Crest Securities adds Red Hat (RHT) and Nutanix (NTNX) to the list of possible Cisco targets.Intel (INTC) is among semiconductor companies with a cash hoard overseas. Intel could bring back about $12 billion, says BMO Capital Markets. Nvidia (NVDA) and Qualcomm (QCOM) also have significant overseas cash. But, BMO Capital does not expect a Trump tax holiday to spur an acquisition spree among chipmakers.

273,QCOM,"XWireless chip maker Qualcomm (QCOM) on Friday slashed its fiscal third-quarter sales and profit expectations after major customer Apple (AAPL) said it will withhold royalty payments until its legal dispute with Qualcomm is resolved. But Qualcomm shares rebounded from early losses.Qualcomm cut its sales forecast for the June quarter by $500 million because Apple is withholding payments to its contract manufacturers for the royalties those companies owe under their licenses with Qualcomm. Those companies in turn are not expected to make royalty payments to Qualcomm this quarter.San Diego-based Qualcomm now expects third-quarter revenue in the range of $4.8 billion to $5.6 billion, down 13% year over year at the midpoint. Its previous guidance was for revenue of $5.3 billion to $6.1 billion.The company is forecasting earnings per share of 80 cents, down 31% from the year-ago figure of $1.16, based on the midpoint of its guidance. Its prior target was $1.03, which would have represented an 11% drop.Qualcomm stock fell as low as 51.05, its lowest since last July. But by the close they had reversed higher for a 1% gain at 53.74 on the stock market today.Qualcomm on Friday said Apple is improperly interfering with its contracts with contract manufacturers. Qualcomm holds essential patents for making mobile phones. Apple has accused Qualcomm in lawsuits of anticompetitive behavior and overcharging for licenses and royalties to those technologies.IBD'S TAKE: Qualcomm has a below-average IBD Composite Rating of 44, meaning it has been outperformed by 56% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months. It ranks No. 30 out of 37 stocks in IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Fabless industry group. For more information on Qualcomm, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.""While Apple has acknowledged that payment is owed for the use of Qualcomm's valuable intellectual property, it nevertheless continues to interfere with our contracts,"" Don Rosenberg, executive vice president and general counsel of Qualcomm said in a prepared statement. ""Apple has now unilaterally declared the contract terms unacceptable; the same terms that have applied to iPhones and cellular-enabled iPads for a decade. Apple's continued interference with Qualcomm's agreements to which Apple is not a party is wrongful and the latest step in Apple's global attack on Qualcomm.""Rosenberg said Qualcomm will continue to vigorously defend its business model and enforce its contract terms.Apple countered that Qualcomm has been refusing to negotiate licensing terms.""We've been trying to reach a licensing agreement with Qualcomm for more than five years, but they have refused to negotiate fair terms,"" an Apple official told the Associated Press. ""As we've said before, Qualcomm's demands are unreasonable and they have been charging higher rates based on our innovation, not their own.""RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani reiterated his sector perform rating on Qualcomm, but cut his price target on the stock to 55 from 60.Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Christopher Rolland maintained his positive rating on Qualcomm, but trimmed his price target to 61 from 63.RELATED:Qualcomm Price Targets Slashed On Apple Uncertainty

274,QCOM,"Biotech sector funds ruled the roost last year but technology focused funds are the clear winners now.Of 217 sector funds that are 10 years or older with at least $100 million in assets, three of the five top sector funds of 2016 were focused on technology. The other two represented the financial services and transportation sectors.All five sector funds featured in the 2017 IBD Mutual Fund Awards beat the benchmark S&P 500 for the past one, three, five and 10 years. Apple or iPhone-related chip stocks were a common underlying theme among the three technology funds.Fidelity Select Semiconductors Portfolio (FSELX) was the top-performing sector fund last year with a 32.4% return. Its three, five and 10-year average annual return is 23.3%, 22% and 10.9%, respectively. The S&P 500 rose nearly 12% last year and 9.9%, 14.7% and 7% for the same periods. Fidelity Select Semiconductors is still beating the S&P 500 so far this year with a gain of 8.58% vs. 5.09%, though it's trailing the top sector funds by about eight percentage points.The Fidelity fund, launched in July 1985, has $2.8 billion in total assets. In October, it changed its name from Fidelity Select Electronics Portfolio to better reflect its focus on chipmakers and chip designers.""Despite a subdued macro environment — semiconductor industry revenue was essentially flat for the past couple of years — semiconductor stocks performed well,"" Steve Barwikowski, who has managed the fund since 2009, told IBD. ""The biggest factor has been M&A with roughly $100 billion worth of deals in each of the last two years.""More than 99% of the fund's assets were in tech stocks, while less than a percentage point was in communications services. Intel (INTC), Qualcomm (QCOM), Broadcom (AVGO), Analog Devices (ADI) and Applied Materials (AMAT), its top five holdings at the end of the year, accounted for 52% of the fund's assets.Barwikowski thinks the chip industry could benefit from the new administration's pro-growth policies in areas such as tax and trade.""I am optimistic that the chips are poised for the best growth we have seen in a few years driven by a combination of healthy supply chain inventories, a more stable personal computing market, continued secular growth in the auto and cloud markets, a strong mobile phone cycle in the second half of the year, and potentially a healthier global macro environment,"" he said. ""Strong fundamentals are somewhat balanced by higher valuations, but there are definitely good opportunities for stock picking.""Up next is RMB Mendon Financial Services (RMBKX) with a 29.7% return in 2016. The $557.4 million fund, managed by Mendon Capital Advisors founder Anton Schutz, was launched in June 1999.As of Nov. 30, the fund was 85% invested in U.S. stocks and had less than 4% in cash. The top five holdings in the 62-stock portfolio were BNC Bancorp (BNCN), Yadkin Financial (YDKN), OceanFirst Financial (OCFC), Atlantic Capital Bancshares (ACBI) and Opus Bank (OPB).""Most of the gain in the financial services sector came in the last two months of the quarter following the surprising results of the presidential election,"" Schutz wrote in the fund's Q4 commentary. ""With visibility increasing around who the decision makers will be in Washington for the next four years, it became clear this was a significant inflection point for financial services in terms of both fundamentals and valuations.""He noted tail winds including corporate tax reform, amendments to Dodd-Frank and the delay of new Department of Labor rules.Fidelity Select Transportation Fund (FSRFX), with $644.7 million in assets, returned 10.5% last year. Industrials accounted for 99.1% of assets as of Jan. 31, with consumer cyclicals and technology making up less than 1%.Its top holdings by weighting as of Dec. 31 were United Parcel Service (UPS), Union Pacific (UNP), FedEx (FDX), CSX (CSX) and American Airlines Group (AAL).""My approach centers on the concepts of value and risk,"" fund manager Matthew Moulis said on Fidelity.com. ""In particular, I look for stocks that I think represent good value, where value is related to the price paid for attributes such as expected profit growth, return on capital and conversion of free cash flow.""Red Oak Technology Select Fund (ROGSX) came in third with a 24.6% return last year. Its average annual gains for the past three, five and 10 years were 12.9%, 18.4% and 11.5%, respectively. The Red Oak fund held total assets of $412.6 million as of Dec. 31, according to fund tracker Morningstar.Technology accounted for 86% of the fund's holdings as of Dec. 31, followed by consumer cyclical, financial services and industrials, at less than 6% each. Mark Oelschlager manages the fund. The fund's top five holdings were Alphabet (GOOGL), Nvidia (NVDA), Cisco Systems (CSCO), Microsoft (MSFT) and Intel (INTC), which recently agreed to by Mobileye (MBLY). Nearly a quarter, or 23%, of the fund's assets were in these names.Red Oak Technology and Fidelity Select Semiconductors both owned Intel, which had a 20% run in Q4. The chip giant's shares have dipped 2% this year, but IBD's overall chipmaker industry group has gained 8% this year and is ranked No. 38 among the 197 tracked by IBD.Columbia Seligman Communications & Information (SLMCX) rounds out the top five with a 15.4% return in 2016. Paul Wick has managed the $4.9 billion fund for 27 years. The fund was 91% invested in technology, 3% each in financial services and consumer cyclicals, and a little over 1% in industrials.Several chip names made its top five as of Jan. 31, including Lam Research (LRCX), Broadcom and Qorvo (QRVO). The three stocks rose 12%, 23% and 26% in Q4 last year. Apple (AAPL), up 20%, was also a top holding. The iPhone maker has rallied this year — it's close to the 20% profit-taking zone from a Jan. 9 breakout past a 117.12 cup-with-handle entry.""We are generally positive about the technology sector going forward despite many of the end markets being challenged for growth, whether that be in PCs, smartphones or networking,"" the managers said in their Q4 commentary. ""We are feeling optimistic about U.S. economic prospects in the wake of the election. In particular, we are enthusiastic that a less onerous regulatory environment should lead to more robust U.S. economic growth and that repatriation of cash held overseas will benefit a huge swath of technology companies in which the portfolio is invested.""RELATED:What's The Stock Market Doing Now?

275,QCOM,"Fitbit (FIT), Xiaomi and Apple (AAPL) collectively make up nearly half of the wearables market, according to IDC figures, but the industry is fragmented enough for other entrants to have a chance at making their mark.Michael Kors (KORS) and Fossil (FOSL) each announced on Tuesday their newest lines of activity trackers and smartwatches, likely hoping to nibble at Fitbit and Apple Watch share.Kors unveiled the Sofie, a women's watch that features a gold pave bezel, and the Grayson, a men's timepiece with a modern face and a ""full-round dial with a rotating crown for quick scrolling."" Both watches have touch screens and use Qualcomm (QCOM) chips.The fashion house — which this year is introducing its wearables to the China and Brazil markets, among others — also released a new version of its micro app that will let users link up to their Instagram accounts and use their own photos as a watch face background.Michael Kors' activity trackers, hybrid smartwatches and touch-screen smartwatches will range from $95 to $350.Meanwhile, Fossil followed up on its previous announcement to debut more than 300 smartwatch styles this year with a showcase at watch and jewelry expo Baselworld.The hundreds of watches will span 14 brands. New touch-screen smartwatches include styles from Diesel, Emporio Armani, Misfit and Fossil's eponymous brand. The lineup includes Michael Kors' new Sofie and Grayson models. (Fossil makes Michael Kors-branded watches under a global licensing agreement that runs through 2024.)New styles of Fossil hybrid smartwatches, i.e. connected watches that look like regular analog watches, will be sold under the Marc Jacobs, Skagen, Tory Burch, Kate Spade (KATE), Michael Kors and other labels.They'll have to contend with an expanding Apple Watch presence: Recent IDC stats point to Apple Watch shipments growing 13% to 4.6 million shipments in Q4 2016 for 13.6% market share.But familiar fashion brands and differentiated styles have the potential to lure users from Apple's relatively uniform look that offers few watch-face variations.IBD'S TAKE: The research firm earlier in the month called the Apple Watch Series 1 and Series a ""magnificent success for the company."" ""With the shift toward watches and clothing, the need of a fashionable design will take center stage,"" said Jitesh Ubrani, IDC's mobile device tracker senior analyst in a Monday release, adding that tech companies will have to ""step up their game"" and offer more selection to broaden their appeal.And that could draw shoppers away from players like Apple.""We also expect more tech vendors to partner with fashion brands for their creativity, and equally important, their distribution network,"" he said. ""In doing so, wearables will be made available to a previously unaware audience — one that frequents fashion outlets over tech outlets.""Michael Kors shares rose 1.8% to 37.23 in the stock market today, but they are still in a steep downtrend Fossil shares climbed  1.9%.

276,QCOM,"Chipmaker Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) received a bullish report Sunday from Canaccord Genuity analyst Michael Walkley, who expects the company to show improving sales and accelerating growth year over year through 2017.Walkley reiterated his buy rating on Skyworks and raised his price target on the stock to 105 from 96.Skyworks shares ended the regular trading session up 0.6% to 95.45 on the stock market today.Skyworks stock broke out of a flat base with a buy point of 81.14 on Jan. 20 after the wireless chip company beat Wall Street expectations with its December-quarter results and current-quarter guidance.IBD'S TAKE: Skyworks stock has an IBD Composite rating of 91, meaning it has outperformed 91% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months. But it ranks No. 8 out of 38 stocks in IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Manufacturing industry group. To see which company leads the group, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.""Skyworks is well positioned for strong trends throughout calendar 2017 driven by strong content share with leading Chinese smartphone (manufacturers) including Vivo, Oppo, Meizu, Xiaomi and Huawei,"" Walkley said.Skyworks also is expected to increase its content share in Samsung smartphones in upcoming quarters, he said.Plus, Skyworks is likely to benefit from the launch of Apple's (AAPL) iPhone 8 smartphone later this year, he said. Skyworks should at least maintain content share in the iPhone 8, Walkley said.Skyworks is adding content share in smartphones as foreign carriers switch from 3G to 4G LTE radio-frequency networks, Walkley said.""We anticipate strong dollar content increases with customers during 2017 and 2018 including Chinese (smartphone makers) and Samsung as Skyworks expands integrated offerings with Wi-Fi, power management, antenna tuning, receive/diversity, filters and integrated modules,"" Walkley said.Meanwhile, Walkley on Sunday reiterated his buy rating on wireless communications chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM) with a price target of 76.He believes that Apple will stick with Qualcomm baseband modems for the iPhone 8, despite its ongoing lawsuits with Qualcomm over royalties and patent licensing.""We believe Apple will continue to use Qualcomm modems in a large portion of future smartphones given Qualcomm's leadership position and strong research and development expenses to maintain its leadership position in future modem technologies,"" Walkley said in a report. ""While Apple and Qualcomm are in an intense licensing dispute that could take a year or more to settle, we believe Apple will not risk its iPhone performance vs. leading Android smartphones and will continue to buy Qualcomm modems in the iPhone 8 and beyond.""However, Baird analyst Tristan Gerra believes Apple will shift more modem chip business to Intel (INTC).""Intel is expected to reach 60-65% market share in the iPhone 8, up from 50% in the iPhone7,"" Gerra said in a report Monday.RELATED:Chipmakers Marvell, Micron Technology Get Price-Target HikesAMD Tumbles For Second Straight Day On Ryzen Chip WorriesBroadcom, Skyworks Jump On iPhone 8 Speculation

277,QCOM,"Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook says his company had no choice but to file a lawsuit against Qualcomm (QCOM) because the mobile chipmaker was overstepping its legal bounds.On his earnings conference call with analysts late Tuesday, Cook discussed why Apple is taking its supplier to court.""I don't like litigation and view it as a last resort,"" Cook said. ""And so you should take from our filing that we viewed it as we didn't see another way forward.""Apple filed a lawsuit against Qualcomm in U.S. federal district court on Jan. 20, alleging that Qualcomm demanded onerous terms for its technology and sought to punish Apple for cooperating in a government antitrust probe.Apple said Qualcomm has withheld $1 billion in rebate payments to Apple as retribution for the iPhone maker's participation in an investigation by South Korea's antitrust regulator.IBD'S TAKE: Qualcomm stock has a mediocre IBD Composite Rating of 49. It ranks No. 25 out of 38 stocks in IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Fabless industry group. For more information on Qualcomm, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.""They were insisting on charging royalties for technologies that they had nothing to do with,"" Cook said. ""And so we were in a situation where the more we innovated with unique features like Touch ID or advanced displays or cameras, just to name a few, the more money Qualcomm would collect for no reason and the more expensive it would be therefore for us to innovate.""Cook drew an analogy to reinforce his point.""It's somewhat like buying a sofa, and you charge somebody a different price depending upon the price of the house that it goes into,"" Cook said. ""This doesn't make sense, and we don't believe it will pass muster in the courts.""Apple's lawsuit was filed three days after the U.S. Federal Trade Commission sued Qualcomm and accused it of using anticompetitive tactics to maintain its monopoly in baseband processors used in wireless devices.Apple also has filed legal action against Qualcomm in China.Apple shares jumped 6.1% to close at 128.79 on the stock market today, after the company posted better-than-expected December quarter earnings.Qualcomm finished the day down 0.5% to 53.15.

Soros also dissolved his firm's positions in Amazon.com (AMZN) and Delta Air Lines (DAL), and added to its stake in Facebook (FB), according to filings late Monday.David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital trimmed its Apple holdings to 4.2 million shares from 6.1 million in Q4, while more than quadrupling its stake in General Motors (GM) to 55 million shares from 13 million.In Q1, Berkshire grew its American Airlines (AAL) stake to 49.3 million shares, up 8.4% vs. the previous quarter, and its investment in Southwest Airlines (LUV) to 47.7 million, up 10.4%. It trimmed its position in Delta to 55 million shares, down 8.3%, while keeping its holdings in United Airlines (UAL) steady at 28.9 million.The regulatory filing confirmed news from early May that Berkshire's Buffett busily dumped tech giant IBM (IBM) in Q1. It had 64.6 million shares left at quarter-end, down 20%. (Even IBM Retirement Fund's unloaded 70,000 shares of IBM, leaving it with 12,451 IBM shares in Q1, according to the fund's 13F filing on May 10.)Meanwhile, the conglomerate's massive long-term stakes in Coca-Cola (KO), American Express (AXP) and Kraft Heinz (KHC) were left basically unchanged.Buffett had already said Berkshire more than doubled its Apple holdings in Q1, giving it a 2.5% stake in the iPhone maker's outstanding shares. Berkshire initiated a position in Apple, worth $1.1 billion, in Q1 2016 and doubled down on Apple as the year progressed.By contrast, Appaloosa Management slashed its stake in 2017's best-performing Dow component Apple by a third, to 300,000 shares, and trimmed Facebook by 12.6%, to 1.9 million shares in Q1, according to filings from Friday. The company also scooped up 100,000 shares of Snap, which tanked 17.5% last week on a dismal debut earnings reports following its March IPO.Similarly, Third Point exited its 1.85 million-share stake in Apple during Q1, while buying 2.25 million shares of Snap.Shares of Berkshire closed up 0.3% at 163.76 on the stock market today. Apple dipped 0.3%, down from Friday's fresh record high, and Snap rallied 8.4%, after last week's plunge. Facebook eased 0.1%, and IBM added 0.7%.Among Appaloosa's other notable moves, the fund entirely liquidated its massive stakes in two troubled stocks: chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM) and retailer J.C. Penney (JCP).Appaloosa added a 1.6 million-share stake in Symantec (SYMC), which was leading a cybersecurity stock rally Monday on the heels of a global ransomware attack. Appaloosa also raised its Western Digital (WDC) stake by 16.1% to 1.3 million shares.But the hedge fund's biggest bet seems to be on an American industrial renaissance. It opened positions of roughly half a million shares each in AK Steel (AKS) and Nucor (NUE), while upping ArcelorMittal (MT) by more than 410%, to nearly 5 million shares.Other hefty new positions included Bank of America (BAC) and CBS (CBS) (8.8 million and 1.0 million shares, respectively).Third Point's other moves include adding to positions in T-Mobile (TMUS), Salesforce (CRM), Qualcomm and Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD).The fund closed a small stake in Goldman Sachs (GS), and reduced holdings in Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase (JPM).Late Friday, Trian Fund Management also disclosed bigger positions in General Electric (GE) and Procter & Gamble (PG) and a smaller stake in DuPont (DD).RELATED:What Will Berkshire Filing Show As Loeb Cuts Facebook, Apple Stakes?Why Buffett Still Isn't Sure If He'd Buy Amazon, Alphabet Stock Now

He said Skyworks is poised to benefit from the release of Apple's (AAPL) iPhone 8 smartphone this fall as well as healthy China handset sales.""Skyworks has executed well despite some of our concerns and inventory uptick, and has been able to show much better content and revenue share gains,"" Rakesh said in a report. ""While the smartphone market continues to mature, we believe Skyworks presents an opportunity with the move to position into a much stronger iPhone 8 cycle, a renewed push from Samsung, and overall healthy China handset market.""IBD'S TAKE: Skyworks stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 92, meaning it has outperformed 92% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months. But it ranks No. 8 out of 38 stocks in IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Manufacturing industry group. To see which company leads the group, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.Mizuho recently raised its expectations for Apple iPhone sales this calendar year. Skyworks gets about 40% of its revenue from Apple business. Mizuho believes iPhone sales will rise about 10% year over year to 225 million units, up from a prior forecast for 213 million.Wells Fargo analyst David Wong set a valuation range on Skyworks of 100 to 118.""Investment positives for Skyworks include high growth demonstrated in recent years, a continuing content increase in opportunity in wireless handsets, diversification into new, higher growth/higher margin products, and a healthy gross margin and financial model,"" Wong said.Risks for Skyworks include customer and sector concentration and competition in the wireless handset radio-frequency chip market, Wong said.Earlier this week, Skyworks earned price target increases from Barclays and Canaccord Genuity, which both reiterated their buy ratings on the stock.Mobile chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM) announced Tuesday that it has extended the offering period of its previously announced cash tender offer to purchase all of the outstanding common shares of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) until April 4.

"
283,QCOM,"Many investors began to drool over the energy and financial sectors after the November elections. The prospect of lower corporate tax rates and less restrictive regulatory yokes was a big reason. But Larry Puglia, manager of $34.2 billion T. Rowe Price Blue Chip Growth Fund (TRBCX), began to place a lot of new bets on the technology sector.That's despite the fact that the tech sector stands to benefit less from changes in corporate taxes. Many tech companies already have less-than-peak rates, Puglia says. In addition, tech industry leaders worry that President Trump's immigration policies could deprive them of skilled workers. Also, investors feared there was friction between President Trump and Amazon (AMZN) CEO Jeff Bezos, who also owns the Washington Post, over the newspaper's campaign coverage.But Puglia feels the benefit to corporations — including many tech companies — of repatriation of bank accounts stuffed with cash has been overlooked somewhat. And Puglia thinks the likelihood of antagonism between the tech sector and the White House is overblown. ""We do not think that would happen to a great degree,"" Puglia said.Puglia's warm outlook for tech is reflected in the fund's most recently disclosed top-10 additions in the past six months. They included not only banking giant JPMorgan Chase (JPM), but also techies Microsoft (MSFT), NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), Alibaba Group (BABA), PayPal Holdings (PYPL), Priceline (PCLN) and Facebook (FB).Fast-food restaurant operator Yum Brands (YUM) was another top-10 addition. And the fund began a new position in brokerage Charles Schwab (SCHW) that was large enough to also enter its top 10.IBD'S TAKE: As the Trump agenda continues to steer the stock market, read IBD Leaderboard and The Big Picture every day to find highly rated stocks and sectors poised to move higher.Puglia's moves are worth watching. Going into Thursday, his fund's 14.64% average annual gain over the prior five years outperformed 94% of its large-cap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc. The S&P 500's 14% pace also trailed. He's in the top 84% year to date, which marks a rebound from 2016's modest 0.98% gain.JPMorgan shot higher shortly before Election Day. After four quarters of declining earnings per share, EPS grew 1%, 20% and 20% in the past three stanzas. Like other banks, JPMorgan benefits from investors' expectations that this corner of financial services will face a lighter regulatory burden than it would have under a Democratic-held White House or Congress. In addition, banks are expected to carve out wider net margins as interest rates increase. They are not expected to raise interest paid to depositors by much if any, yet they will be able to charge more for loans.Microsoft is well-positioned to keep on generating strong growth in its Office 365 suite of products, Puglia says. He also likes the outlook for its corporate cloud operations and Azure, its public cloud-computing platform.Chipmaker NXP is a leading provider of semiconductor solutions used in automotive connectivity and infotainment, he says. NXP's chips are also used in smartphone near-field communications payment applications. On Tuesday, Qualcomm (QCOM) extended its takeover bid for NXP until April 4.Alibaba offers consumer-to-consumer e-commerce services through its Taobao business and it runs T-Mall, a business-to-consumer platform. Both have dominant market share, Puglia says. Alibaba is also a leader in cloud processing services. The Chinese government is a key customer. Trading around 103 as of early Thursday, shares are below a 104.67 cup-with-handle entry.Money-transfer services provider PayPal has a five-year earnings annual growth rate of 25%. And it has reached deals with Mastercard (MA) and Visa (V) that are mutually beneficial, Puglia says. Many investors had feared a more adversarial competition among the three companies. And Puglia likes PayPal's Venmo, Braintree and One Touch services.Trading around 43, shares are still trading just under a 43.17 buy point of a cup-with-handle base. EPS grew 9%, 13% and 17% in the past three quarters.Priceline gapped up nearly 6% on Feb. 28, a day after reporting a 32% increase in fourth-quarter EPS. Its top line grew 17% to $2.34 billion. Both earnings and revenue topped the company's own guidance. Hotel bookings have been the stock's largest growth driver. Airline ticket sales fell. That's despite steadily low oil prices, which have helped keep airfares down. The company's EPS grew 12%, 23% and 32% the past three quarters.Facebook shares are up 20% this year. Investors have begun to appreciate how well the company's advertising products, video strategy and Instagram photo sharing are being received, Puglia says. He adds that its investment in WhatsApp and Messenger also provides solid positioning in the messaging market, which is growing in popularity. ""We especially like the company's efforts to promote the use of video on its platform and to better monetize Instagram and video,"" he said.Facebook reportedly made the launch of its Facebook Live video service a priority last year. But enough users have posted videos of violence and crime to make at least some advertisers wary of the platform, according to CNBC.com. Facebook also has been hit with measurement controversies.Yum shares rose 9% this year through Feb. 13 to a 52-week high, but they've pulled back 7% since then. That has left them a scant 3% above where they were when Yum spun off its China division last Oct. 31. After EPS grew 44% for three quarters in a row, EPS grew 18% in Q4.Schwab has done a nice job of growing customer assets under management, Puglia wrote to shareholders on Dec. 31. ""Its earnings should benefit substantially from rising interest rates,"" Puglia added. ""This is enhanced by the fact that Schwab has a significant bank embedded within the company. That enables it to sweep brokerage deposits into the bank, creating more net interest income.""Rain fell on Schwab's parade recently when it got caught up in a pricing war with Fidelity Investments and TD Ameritrade (AMTD) over brokerage commissions. But Puglia says Schwab is far less dependent on commissions than TD Ameritrade is.RELATED:12 Blue-Chip Beauties That This Top Money Manager Likes NowDoes Your Mutual Fund Manager Have Skin In The Game?

284,QCOM,"In the family tree of bullish chart patterns, the double-bottom base is a key member. If this one had a cousin, it would be the ""shakeout + 3 points.""Why learn this pattern?It might not occur as often as the double bottom, but it carries many of the same elements of price-and-volume action. (See the recent Investor's Corner column for a full explanation of the double-bottom base.) So, by searching for this pattern, you're also training your eyes for the double bottom.Another reason? Shakeout + 3, a concept discussed by legendary trader Jesse Livermore in his book ""How to Trade in Stocks,"" can yield an earlier entry point than a double bottom.Keep in mind, though, that because the buy point is often found deep within the base, the stock can still swing sharply as it moves up in price and approaches the high in the base. It's perhaps easier to be shaken out of the stock, even with an 8% stop-loss sell rule in place.Shakeout + 3 is not discussed in William O'Neil's investing classic ""How to Make Money in Stocks,"" but it's been featured in a few examples at IBD's advanced workshops and complimentary trading summits.Like the double bottom, the shakeout + 3 features two sharp sell-offs, and the second drop undercuts the first low.This shakeout pushes the supply of readily available shares from the hands of the weak into the hands of the strong. Then the stock immediately turns and rushes higher, often within just a week or two. When the stock returns to the price of the first low, say $30, add three points. That's your entry point.A three-point rally in a $30 stock is a 10% gain. In other words, there must be genuine demand. A stock priced at $100 a share might need a 10- or 15-point gain to reflect the same strength of demand.In January 2010, China's fast-growing economy hotel chain, Home Inns, reversed from a two-year high of 41.70 (1), then tobogganed down 14.81 points, or 36%, in just four weeks' time.From that point in early February, the stock worked its way to the top of an unusual-looking base.In June, Home Inns formed a narrow handle (2), then rallied three weeks in a row while motoring past a 39.73 buy point.But in early July, the stock dipped as low as 36.63, forcing holders to exit with an 8% loss.The NYSE composite and S&P 500 followed through on July 7. Meanwhile, Home Inns fashioned a rare five-week square box pattern with a 42.94 buy point. This time, the breakout worked (3).Was there an earlier buy point? Yes. In the week ended March 19, Home Inns hit a low of 30.22 (4), then rallied through the end of April. During the May Flash Crash, Home Inns nose-dived as much as 18%, undercutting the 30.22 low in heavy volume.But the next week, the stock rebounded 16% in even faster trade (5). That week, shares also triggered the shakeout + 3 rule, rising past 33.22.Pullbacks in the following weeks never came close to forcing holders to cut losses at 7% or 8%.Home Inns closed the week ended May 14 at 36.19, still 13% below the high in the base of 41.70.

285,QCOM,"Qualcomm (QCOM) stock rebounded on Wednesday, a day after the U.S. Federal Trade Commission filed an antitrust complaint against the maker of chips for mobile phones.In a complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California late Tuesday, the FTC alleged that Qualcomm used anti-competitive tactics to maintain its monopoly in baseband processors used in mobile phones.In a statement, Qualcomm said it plans to vigorously contest the complaint and defend its business practices.""Qualcomm believes the complaint is based on a flawed legal theory, a lack of economic support and significant misconceptions about the mobile technology industry,"" the company said.IBD'S TAKE: Qualcomm stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 82, meaning it has outperformed 82% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months. But it ranks No. 20 out of 39 stocks in IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Fabless industry group. For more information on Qualcomm, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.Qualcomm stock finished the day up 1.5% to 65.13 on the stock market today. On Tuesday, Qualcomm fell 4% and touched a nearly four-month low.""The portrayal of facts offered by the FTC as the basis for the agency's case is significantly flawed,"" Qualcomm said. ""In particular, Qualcomm has never withheld or threatened to withhold chip supply in order to obtain agreement to unfair or unreasonable licensing terms. The FTC's allegation to the contrary — the central thesis of the complaint — is wrong.""Qualcomm noted that a divided FTC filed the complaint on a 2-1 vote, with FTC Commissioner Maureen Ohlhausen offering a dissenting statement.The FTC rushed to file the complaint just days ahead of a change in administration with in-coming President Donald Trump. The FTC currently has just three of five commissioner positions filled.Cowen analyst Timothy Arcuri reiterated his outperform rating and 74 price target on Qualcomm stock.In a research note Tuesday, Arcuri said the FTC's action ""appears politically motivated and likely to be altered once a Republican majority is restored.""The FTC currently has two Democrats (Chairwoman Edith Ramirez and Commissioner Terrell McSweeny) and one Republican (Commissioner Maureen Ohlhausen). It will soon have a third vacancy, because Ramirez is stepping down effective Feb. 10.""We believe it is likely a Trump-led FTC ends up withdrawing its complaint,"" Arcuri said.UBS analyst Stephen Chin reiterated his neutral rating on Qualcomm and lowered his price target to 68 from 72, given uncertainties surrounding the litigation.

289,QCOM,"George Soros took stakes in Facebook (FB) and Dow component Goldman Sachs (GS) in the fourth quarter, while Appaloosa cut its stake in Apple (AAPL), and both followed Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BKRB) in appearing to find a bargain in airlines. Here's a look at how some big investors managed their portfolios in the last quarter of last year.Soros Fund Management bought 353,686 shares in Facebook and bulked up its stake in Alphabet (GOOGL) by nearly 60% to 20,200 shares, according to a regulatory filing out late Tuesday. Soros also increased his T-Mobile (TMUS) stake to 685,700 shares.Soros bought 62,100 shares in Goldman Sachs. Dan Loeb's Third Point last week disclosed that it had scooped up shares of Goldman, Bank of America (BAC) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM).Bank stocks have risen on greater expectations of lighter regulations, higher interest rates and greater volatility, which Goldman's trading desk could benefit from in particular.Soros also took a 40,000-share stake in Delta Air Lines (DAL), but dropped United Airlines (UAL).Shares of Apple ended regular trading up 0.4% to 135.51 on the stock market today, after hitting a record high yesterday. Facebook fell 0.3% to 133.44, while Goldman Sachs rose 0.4% to 250.54. Delta climbed 2.6% to 51.17, American rose 2.1% to 47.54, and United gained 2.7% to 75.75.IBD'S TAKE: Even as big investors flocked to the airlines last year, Cowen analysts last month said shares of airlines could be ""due for a break"" after taking off in Q4. Meanwhile, Soros dropped Activision Blizzard (ATVI), Herbalife (HLF), Harley Davidson (HOG), PepsiCo (PEP) and JCPenney (JCP). He also dissolved his stake in Nordstrom (JWN)Soros also offloaded his position in consumer-care products giant Procter & Gamble (PG), which got a lift Tuesday after activist investor Trian took a more than $3 billion stake in the company.Hedge fund Appaloosa Management increased its stake in Facebook by 47% to 2.2 million shares. The fund also upped its holdings in Qualcomm (QCOM) and more than doubled its stake in Southwest (LUV). Appaloosa also took a 160,000-share stake in United Airlines.The fund loaded up on the health sector, taking new stakes in companies like Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), Centene (CNC), McKesson (MCK) and Pfizer (PFE). It also took a new stake in JCPenney.Appaloosa cut its position in Apple by 350,000 shares, slashed its stake in Yahoo (YHOO) and rid itself of Bank of America and General Motors (GM).Along with boosting its stake in Apple, David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital dissolved its stake in Take-Two Interactive (TTWO), U.S. Steel (X) and Michael Kors (KORS).Like Buffett, Greenlight also took a stake in Monsanto (MON).But the moves by Soros and Appaloosa into airlines are notable in that they could signal other big investors are following Buffett, who announced Q3 stakes in the sector last year.Buffett, after years of avoiding the airlines, has come around to the industry. Airlines last year showed more signs of discipline, and the wave of consolidation over the past several years has kept the major airlines relatively insulated from new competition.""When we launched on the sector late last year, we found most investors generally in agreement that airlines represented deep value,"" Barclays analyst Brandon Oglenski wrote in a research note dated Tuesday.""The biggest question remains: when will the market and, more importantly, large long-term investors begin to care? We think tonight's Berkshire Hathaway 13F will go a long way to attract sector interest.""RELATED:Airline Stocks Tumble On Fears Capacity May Creep Back UpDelta, American, United Go Guns Blazing Into Battle Of The AtlanticJPMorgan Sets Fresh High, Goldman Hits Highest Since 2007 On Yellen

290,QCOM,"Mobile chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM) late Wednesday reported December quarter results that missed views on sales but beat earnings per share by a penny. It also gave guidance that was in line with Wall Street's targets for the March quarter.Qualcomm stock fell over 1% in after-hours trading following the earnings news release. During the regular session Wednesday, Qualcomm rose 3.5% to 56.90.San Diego-based Qualcomm earned $1.19 a share excluding items, up 23% year over year, on sales of $6.0 billion, up 4%, in fiscal Q1 ended Dec. 25.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected Qualcomm to earn $1.18 a share ex items on sales of $6.12 billion.IBD'S TAKE: Qualcomm stock has a mediocre IBD Composite Rating of 49. It ranks No. 31 out of 39 stocks in IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Fabless industry group. For more information on Qualcomm, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.For the current quarter, Qualcomm expects to earn $1.20 a share excluding items, up 15% year over year, on sales of $5.9 billion, up 5%, based on the midpoint of its guidance. That guidance matches Wall Street's view.""We are pleased with the strong start to our fiscal year and the year-over-year earnings growth across both our semiconductor and licensing businesses,"" Qualcomm CEO Steve Mollenkopf said in a statement. ""Looking ahead, the pending NXP acquisition accelerates our strategic transformation in the high growth areas of automotive, IoT (internet of things), security and networking.""Qualcomm stock has been hit hard since Jan. 17 when the U.S. Federal Trade Commission filed an antitrust complaint against the company. The FTC alleges that Qualcomm used its monopoly position in baseband processors for wireless devices to strong-arm customers and suppress competition.Qualcomm called those charges legally flawed and politically motivated.Qualcomm customer Apple (AAPL) followed with its own U.S. federal court lawsuit against the chipmaker on Friday.On Saturday, Qualcomm accused Apple of ""actively encouraging regulatory attacks ... around the world.""Qualcomm's licensing practices have come under fire previously. In 2015, Qualcomm paid a $975 million fine in China and, late last year, South Korea fined Qualcomm $853 million. The European Union also is probing Qualcomm.On Wednesday, news broke that Apple also has filed two lawsuits against Qualcomm in China.""These filings by Apple's Chinese subsidiary are just part of Apple's efforts to find ways to pay less for Qualcomm's technology,"" Don Rosenberg, Qualcomm executive vice president and general counsel, said in a statement. ""Apple was offered terms consistent with terms accepted by more than one hundred other Chinese companies and refused to even consider them.""Mollenkopf addressed the recent litigation in the company's Q1 earnings press release.""The recent legal and governmental actions against Qualcomm are at their core driven by commercial disputes,"" he said. ""As we have done in the past, we will vigorously defend our business model and the value of a portfolio of technologies that has been so instrumental to the success of the mobile communications industry.""

291,QCOM,"Wireless chip maker Qualcomm (QCOM) received a flurry of price-target cuts to its stock on Thursday, a day after the company warned about potential revenue and earnings shortfalls from its ongoing legal clash with major customer Apple (AAPL).At least seven investment banks lowered their price targets on Qualcomm following the San Diego-based company's fiscal second-quarter earnings report late Wednesday. They included: BMO Capital Markets, Canaccord Genuity, CFRA Research, Cowen, Mizuho, Pacific Crest Securities and Susquehanna Financial Group.Qualcomm stock rallied to close up 0.1% at 52.66 on the stock market today after trading as low as 51.40 and as high as 53.40Qualcomm posted better-than-expected fiscal second-quarter sales and earnings, but guided analysts lower for the current quarter.For the current quarter, Qualcomm expects to earn $1.03 a share, down 11% year over year, on sales of $5.7 billion, down 5%, based on the midpoint of its guidance range. Wall Street had been modeling for Qualcomm to earn $1.10 a share on sales of $5.95 billion in the June quarter.Qualcomm executives said its legal dispute with Apple over technology licensing royalties did not have much impact on its March quarter results, but could starting with the June quarter.Apple also is expected to shift more of its wireless modem chip business to Intel (INTC) and away from Qualcomm starting with the upcoming iPhone 8 handset.Cowen analyst Timothy Arcuri said Qualcomm appears to have a strong case against Apple in its legal fight and the risk to Qualcomm's licensing business model is low.Arcuri also said it would be foolish for Apple to displace Qualcomm with Intel modems in its upcoming smartphones, because Qualcomm has superior technology.""Apple would in reality not risk its brand ahead of Gigabit LTE and 5G (technology rollouts) for what is clearly an inferior roadmap from Intel,"" he said.Arcuri reiterated his outperform rating on Qualcomm, but lowered his price target to 70 from 73.IBD'S TAKE: The IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks includes seven chipmakers include Nvidia, Microchip Technology and Cirrus Logic.On a conference call with analysts Wednesday, Qualcomm President Derek Aberle said the company is confident it will win its legal dispute with Apple.""We have a strong track record of establishing and defending the value of our technologies that have played an important role in enabling the entire mobile ecosystem, including the incredible smartphone experience,"" Aberle said. ""We have freely negotiated and entered into more than 300 license agreements over many years, including with the largest and most sophisticated companies in our industry.""The offers Qualcomm has made Apple for a direct license to its cellular standard essential patents are consistent with the license agreements it has entered into with other customers.""It is unfortunate that Apple has rejected these fair and reasonable offers,"" Aberle said.RELATED:Qualcomm Beats Street Views For Second Quarter, Guides LowerQualcomm Sliced On Apple; Broadcom May Team Up For Toshiba Unit

292,QCOM,"Wireless chip maker Qualcomm (QCOM) received a stock rating downgrade on Wednesday ahead of its fiscal second-quarter earnings report after the close. Meanwhile, Broadcom (AVGO) reportedly might partner with a Japanese government-backed fund and policy bank to bid for Toshiba's semiconductor unit.Rosenblatt Securities analyst Jun Zhang lowered his rating on Qualcomm to neutral from buy with a price target of 56.Qualcomm stock was down a fraction, near 52.50, in afternoon trading on the stock market today.Qualcomm's legal battle with Apple (AAPL) over patent licensing terms is likely to lead to lower chip sales for Apple's upcoming iPhone 8, he said. Qualcomm is seen losing market share to Intel (INTC) in the new handset.Apple fell 0.2% to 140.88 intraday, dropping just below a 141.12 buy point once again. Intel climbed 0.8%, regaining its 50-day line.IBD'S TAKE: The IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks includes eight chipmakers include Nvidia, Microchip Technology and Cirrus Logic.""Recent supply chain work suggests that Apple will likely reduce Qualcomm modem share in the iPhone 8 from 60% to 35% in second-half 2017,"" Zhang said in a report. ""In our view, Apple is trying to pressure Qualcomm during the litigation process.""Qualcomm's market share gains with Chinese smartphone makers will not be enough to offset the revenue decline from Apple, he said.""We estimate Qualcomm's (chip) shipments to Apple to be down from 75-80 million units in second-half 2016 to 45-50 million units in second-half 2017,"" he said. ""Apple accounts for roughly 18-20% of Qualcomm's revenue, and we believe the share loss will reduce Qualcomm's revenue by $200 million per quarter in second-half 2017.""Qualcomm is scheduled to report fiscal second-quarter results after the market close Wednesday.Elsewhere in the chip industry, Broadcom is considering a joint bid for Toshiba's memory chip business with Innovation Network Corp. of Japan and the Development Bank of Japan, Japan's Asahi newspaper reported.Other bidders for the prized Toshiba unit include Taiwan's Hon Hai Precision Industry, aka Foxconn; as well as South Korea's SK Hynix and U.S.-based Western Digital (WDC), Reuters reported.Broadcom and Western Digital shares rose fractionally intraday.RELATED:Chip Stocks At 'Peak Valuations'; Nvidia Has Most Downside, Analyst SaysQualcomm: Apple Misled On Intel Chip Performance In iPhone 7

293,QCOM,"Samsung's latest flagship smartphone is packed with high-end chips and other components — making it more expensive than its predecessors and competitors — but Apple's (AAPL) upcoming iPhone 8 is expected to be have similar specifications and also carry a rich price tag.Research firm IHS Markit on Friday released a report on Samsung's new Galaxy S8 smartphone in which researchers took the device apart in what is known as a teardown analysis. It estimates that the Galaxy S8 costs $307.50 to build, $43.34 higher than that of the Galaxy S7.The unsubsidized retail price for the Galaxy S8 with 64 gigabytes of flash memory is about $720. A step-up model, the 6.2-inch Galaxy S8 Plus, costs about $840.The higher build cost for the S8 is ""part of a trend that reflects something of an arms race in features among Apple, Samsung and other phone manufacturers, as they all try to add new and distinguishing hardware features,"" IHS analyst Andrew Rassweiler said in a statement. ""While there are new nonhardware features in the Galaxy S8, such as a virtual assistant called Bixby, from a teardown perspective the hardware in the Galaxy S8 and that of the forthcoming new iPhone is expected to be very similar.""Two major components of the Galaxy S8 are its gigabit LTE capability for much faster data transfer speeds and its borderless 5.8-inch ultra-high-definition OLED display.Apple's iPhone 8 could retail for $1,000 because of its premium feature set, some analysts speculate. Apple's current top-of-the-line handset, the 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus, starts at $769 for the base model with 32-gigabytes of data storage.Component suppliers in the Galaxy S8 are carry-overs from the S7, IHS analyst Wayne Lam said in an email.Qualcomm (QCOM) is supplying its Snapdragon 835 chip set for S8 models in the U.S. and China, while Samsung is using its Exynos chip set for S8 models in the rest of the world.Broadcom (AVGO) and Qorvo (QRVO) are supplying radio-frequency chips for the S8. Broadcom also is providing the GPS navigation receiver chip.Integrated Device Technology (IDTI) is making a wireless power receiver for the device. Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM) is providing a power management chip and heart-rate sensor. STMicroelectronics (STM) is supplying accelerometer, gyroscope and barometric pressure sensors.Silicon Motion (SIMO) is making a tuner-demodulator chip for the device.

294,QCOM,"LAS VEGAS — Qualcomm (QCOM) CEO Steve Mollenkopf on Friday said the jump to fifth-generation wireless technology (5G) will have a profound impact on everything from health care to autonomous cars.In a keynote speech at the annual CES consumer electronics show, Mollenkopf said his wireless chip company will play a vital role in the transition to 5G, which is just starting to be tested.""5G isn't incremental improvement in connectivity or even just a new generation of mobile — 5G will be a new kind of network, supporting a vast diversity of devices with unprecedented scale, speed and complexity,"" Mollenkopf said. ""That new network will change the way we live, work and even the way we relate to each other.""The rollout of 5G will inspire an ""invention revolution,"" he said.""Entire industries will change and emerge as data speeds go up and data costs come down,"" he said. 5G will truly enable the Internet of Things, Mollenkopf said.IBD'S TAKE: While Qualcomm stock has been merely OK, plenty of others at any given time are doing very well. And one place to find these technology stocks amid your research is IBD Tech Leaders.An economic study commissioned by Qualcomm forecast that the 5G value chain will generate up to $3.5 trillion in revenue in 2035 and support up to 22 million jobs, he said.The study also predicted that up to $12 trillion in goods and services enabled by 5G could be produced in 2035, when the full economic benefit of 5G is expected to be realized worldwide across industries.""5G will make mobile even more essential than it is today,"" he said. ""5G will have an impact similar to the introduction of electricity or the automobile, affecting entire economies and benefiting entire societies.""Qualcomm plans to conduct 5G radio trials with AT&T (T), Ericsson (ERIC) and SK Telecom (SKM) this year, Mollenkopf said.Qualcomm stock slipped 2 cents to 65.53 on the stock market today and continues to lag its 50-day line.

295,QCOM,"Foxconn is considering a joint investment with Apple (AAPL) to build a panel facility in the U.S. that would cost more than $7 billion and create 30,000-50,000 jobs, Chairman Terry Gou told reporters Sunday.That comes after President Trump, in his inaugural address, vowed to make ""America First"" the core principle of his administration. ""We will follow two simple rules: buy American and hire American.""Trump had campaigned on Apple bringing iPhone production to the U.S., recently expressing his optimism that Apple CEO Tim Cook had his ""eyes open"" to the idea. Foxconn is the largest assembler of iPhones.IBD'S TAKE: Want to do your part to ""buy American""? U.S. tech stocks Amazon, Facebook and Adobe are near buy range.Gou said an investment by Foxconn's Sharp unit would depend on incentives negotiated at the U.S. state and federal levels.Foxconn's chairman said ""protectionism"" was inevitable, the Asian Nikkei Review quoted him as saying, though he's not sure how American consumers will respond to the higher costs. ""In the future they may be paying some $500 more for (U.S.) products, but those do not necessarily work better than a $300 phone.""Gou also pledged increased investments in China.Apple relies heavily on China, not only for production but also sales. China accounted for $46.4 billion in revenue for Apple, or 22% of its total.Boeing (BA), General Motors (GM), Qualcomm (QCOM), Intel (INTC) and Las Vegas Sands (LVS) are among the many the U.S. multinationals that are heavily exposed to China's market and could be threatened if President Trump and China gear up for a trade war.RELATED:Apple, GM, Boeing Are China's Top Hostages In A Trump Trade WarQualcomm: Apple Is 'Encouraging Regulatory Attacks'

296,QCOM,"As telecom companies ramp up investments in 5G wireless technology, investors should focus on chip and network equipment manufacturers as well as cell-tower operators and fiber-optic-gear makers, says an in-depth research report by Cowen & Co.Trials of 5G wireless networks are underway, but wide-scale deployment isn't expected until 2020.""At this early juncture, we believe the best way to play 5G is to invest in the companies that will help facilitate the network buildouts, including the chip/equipment manufacturers and the tower/fiber providers,"" said the report.Cowen flagged American Tower (AMT), Crown Castle (CCI) and SBA Communications (SBAC); fiber-optic-gear makers Acacia Communications (ACIA), Ciena (CIEN) and Oclaro (OCLR); fiber-optic-network operator Zayo Holdings (ZAYO); and chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM).IBD'S TAKE: Shares of several of Cowen's 5G picks are struggling. Oclaro, though, has a highest-possible Composite Rating of 99, while Ciena's CR is 90. Zayo has a technical buy point of 35.75. Learn more about CRs and CANSLIM investing, and learn more about Oclaro and other stocks at IBD Stock Checkup. Many of the companies aiming to put 5G on the fast track — Qualcomm, Intel (INTC), Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Verizon Communications (VZ) — expect initial trials to involve fixed wireless broadband services to residential homes, as well as the Internet of Things.IoT encompasses such burgeoning arenas as self-driving cars, advanced robotics, telemedicine, automated factories, smart cities and the development of massive sensor networks in such fields as agriculture.""5G will require a lot more antennas/radios in a lot more locations of which the majority will need to be connected with fiber,"" said Cowen. ""This serendipitously will provide an opportunity for AT&T (T)/Verizon to again distance themselves from Sprint/T-Mobile in terms of network, because they will be able/willing to make the sizable investment to build out this new topology.""South Korea's KT and Verizon are forging ahead in pre-standard deployment of 5G, aiming to drive technical specifications for 5G radio gear. IoT revenue is about 1% of global mobile revenue now but will grow at about 20% annually over the next five years, says market research firm Analysys Mason""5G will be about flexibility and versatility as the network will be software-based, scalable, sliceable, and 'versioned' for different verticals/users. 5G will provide a new level of data coordination and help make sense of data as the Big Data industry takes on a much larger and more meaningful role in our lives,"" Cowen's report said.Of the stocks cited, the only big mover in midday trading in the stock market today was Qualcomm, which plunged 12.7% to close at 54.88 on continued fallout from Apple's (AAPL) suit against the mobile chipmaker on Friday over technology licensing. Qualcomm, which called Apple's suit ""baseless,"" got at least one downgrade Monday, from Nomura Instinet, ahead of its earnings due after the close Wednesday. Nomura Instinet said regulatory scrutiny could impact Qualcomm's pending $47 billion acquisition of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI).

297,QCOM,"Large-cap stocks paced equities lower Tuesday, but the U.S. market still looks poised for a positive finish in January. While the Dow Jones industrial average slid more than 0.6% and fell further below the highly touted 20,000 milestone, the small-cap-oriented Russell 2000 gave up little ground in the early going and was fractionally higher.The Russell 2000, which galloped more than 19% higher in 2016, is now down just a tad since Jan. 1. But the 30-member Dow industrials still stood about 0.2% higher, while the Nasdaq composite leads the way so far in 2017 with its 3.9% gain.Apple (AAPL), meanwhile, edged 0.6% lower to 120.85 and remained in buy range past a new 118.12 entry in a 12-week cup-with-handle base, just ahead of its quarterly results due after the market close.As a megacap stock that has morphed into a ""growth and income"" play, Apple has not shown extraordinary power, yet it's also acted fine since surpassing the proper handle buy point on Jan. 6 and 7.Wall Street on consensus expects the iPhone maker's earnings to fall 2% to $3.22 a share. That would extend a three-quarter streak of falling profits (-18%, -23% and -15% in the prior three quarters). But some of the 37 analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters do forecast a year-over-year gain, with the highest estimate currently at $3.77 a share, which would spell a 17% increase.Watch to see what the total shares outstanding will be at the end of the December quarter. Corporate buybacks, or the lack of employee stock options issuance, can help reduce share count significantly enough to bump up earnings per share.At the end of fiscal fourth quarter on Sept. 24, 2016, Apple had 5.39 billion diluted shares outstanding. On a 12-month basis, diluted shares dropped to 5.5 billion shares vs. 5.79 billion shares on Sept. 26, 2015.The Nasdaq composite was down less than 0.1% with about half an hour to go in the stock market today, mirroring Monday's action in which it bounced off intraday lows. The Nasdaq 100 dropped nearly 0.3%, while the S&P 500 lost around 0.2%.IBD'S TAKE: During a confirmed uptrend, the leading big, mid- and small-cap equities will break out of well-formed bases. Learn how to capture shares in these stocks at the most opportune time by mastering historically proven chart patterns such as the cup-with-handle base.Returning to Apple, the megacap with a $646 billion market capitalization had initially broken out of a cup with handle at 110.33 on Sept. 14 as the stock lifted out of a long, deep, bottoming-base pattern. The stock rallied 7.5%, then pulled back to test its 200-day moving average. The Nov. 14 bounce off that long-term support line gave a bullish sign that Apple still has institutional support.Through last week, Apple has risen as much as 36% off the 89.47 low within its deep saucerlike pattern.Revenue is seen rising 2% to $77.4 billion in the December-ended first quarter, then accelerating to a 6.7% gain to $53.9 billion vs. year-ago levels in fiscal Q2. Strong growth in service-related revenue and increased market share against beleaguered South Korean rival Samsung may help boost the top line in FY 2017.Not all big-cap techs are having a rosy start.Qualcomm (QCOM), which faces a lawsuit from Apple alleging unfair pricing of its wireless chip technology, continues to drop after it plunged more than 12% to 54.88 on Jan. 23, slashing through its 200-day moving average in heavy trading.The stock fell an additional 0.4% to 53.38 on Tuesday, suggesting that it will take quite a bit of time before the San Diego-based wireless play forms a new base and sets up for a potential new price run.In contrast, Nvidia (NVDA) is showing remarkable resilience as shares eased 0.7% to 109.30. For the time being, the star tech stock of 2016 has not corrected long enough to form a proper base. A cup must stretch a minimum six weeks in time. Plus, the 17% correction from head to toe is too deep as a potential flat-base pattern. Fellow chip design and data networking play Cavium Networks (CAVM) is acting well too, rising nearly 0.4% to 66.38 as it tries to clear a 66.22 buy point on a long cup with handle.HealthEquity (HQY), which joined IBD Leaderboard on Jan. 9 and later joined the Leaderboard Cut List, made a round trip of mild gains since it cleared a 45.10 flat-base buy point. The health savings account pioneer was off just 4 cents at 46.04, and its uptrend remains intact.Notice how HealthEquity continues to trade above its fast-rising 50-day moving average. The Utah-based firm retook that 50-day line in big volume following President Trump's Nov. 8 election win.Going into February, a look at IBD's stock research tables shows that the banking, chip, electronics, machinery, auto and transport sectors are commanding the upside for now. Investors who focus on these sectors have a higher likelihood of making money in stocks.But make sure to deploy cash in the leading names at proper buy points, not the laggards. The poorly rated companies may stay that way unless a real change in fundamentals occurs.RELATED:How To Trade Stocks: Which Techs Are Not Failing Post-Breakout?How To Trade: What To Look For In Apple's Quarterly ResultsHow To Trade: When Did Nvidia Show Signs A Correction Is Near?How To Invest: Does Apple's New Grandiose Headquarters The End Of Its Mighty Run?How To Invest: Start February Right And Take These Tips From Gerald Loeb, A Wall Street Master

298,QCOM,"A day after Apple (AAPL) sued Qualcomm (QCOM) over its licensing practices, the mobile chipmaker responded Saturday, saying that ""Apple's claims are baseless"" and accused the iPhone maker of ""actively encouraging regulatory attacks...around the world.""Here is a complete statement from Don Rosenberg, executive vice president and general counsel at Qualcomm:""While we are still in the process of reviewing the complaint in detail, it is quite clear that Apple's claims are baseless. Apple has intentionally mischaracterized our agreements and negotiations, as well as the enormity and value of the technology we have invented, contributed and shared with all mobile device makers through our licensing program. Apple has been actively encouraging regulatory attacks on Qualcomm's business in various jurisdictions around the world, as reflected in the recent KFTC decision and FTC complaint, by misrepresenting facts and withholding information. We welcome the opportunity to have these meritless claims heard in court where we will be entitled to full discovery of Apple's practices and a robust examination of the merits.""Qualcomm is blaming Apple for recent charges by the Federal Trade Commission and South Korea's Fair Trade Commission (KFTC).The U.S. FTC last Tuesday accused the chipmaker of anticompetitive tactics to keep its monopoly in baseband processors used in wireless devices. The FTC said Qualcomm forced Apple to use its chips exclusively to get lower licensing fees, cutting out rivals.Qualcomm said it would vigorously fight the FTC charges, calling them flawed and political.The company's licensing practices have come under fire around the world. It paid a $975 million fine in China in 2015 and late last year South Korea fined Qualcomm $853 million. The European Union also is probing Qualcomm.Qualcomm fell 2.4% to 62.88 on the stock market Friday, falling to its lowest level since late September on the Apple lawsuit. Apple rose 0.2% to 120, still in buying range from its 118.12 buy point.RELATED:Apple Sues Qualcomm Over Patent Licensing PracticesQualcomm Antitrust Lawsuit Called Flawed, PoliticalQualcomm Strong-Armed Apple, Others, U.S. Antitrust Lawsuit Says

299,QCOM,"Three days after U.S. regulators filed an antitrust lawsuit against mobile chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM) over its technology licensing practices, iPhone maker Apple (AAPL) has filed its own suit against Qualcomm.In a lawsuit filed Friday in federal district court for the Southern District of California, Apple alleged that Qualcomm demanded onerous terms for its technology and sought to punish Apple for cooperating in a regulatory probe in South Korea.Apple claims Qualcomm misused its position as a monopoly supplier of critical chip technology for mobile phones and exacted ""onerous, unreasonable and costly"" terms for its patents. Qualcomm also has withheld $1 billion in rebate payments to Apple as retribution for the iPhone maker's participation in an investigation by South Korea's antitrust regulator, Apple said.On Tuesday, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission sued Qualcomm and accused it of using anticompetitive tactics to maintain its monopoly in baseband processors used in wireless devices.IBD'S TAKE: Qualcomm stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 81, meaning it has outperformed 81% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months. But it ranks No. 21 out of 39 stocks in IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Fabless industry group. For more information on Qualcomm, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.The FTC said Qualcomm forced Apple to use its chips exclusively in return for lower licensing fees, unfairly cutting out competitors.Qualcomm said it plans to vigorously contest the complaint and defend its business practices. It called the FTC's lawsuit legally flawed and politically motivated.In a statement on the FTC case, Qualcomm sought to paint its customers as ingrates.""The complaint seeks to advance the interests and bargaining power of companies that have generated billions in profit from sales of products made possible by the fundamental 3G and 4G cellular technology developed by innovators like Qualcomm,"" the statement said.Qualcomm shares fell 2.4% to 62.88 on the stock market today to their lowest level since late September. Most of the losses came in the final minutes of Friday's trading session, as news of the Apple lawsuit hit. Apple rose 0.2% to 120.RELATED:Qualcomm Antitrust Lawsuit Called Flawed, PoliticalQualcomm Strong-Armed Apple, Others, U.S. Antitrust Lawsuit Says

300,QCOM,"XQualcomm (QCOM) late Wednesday posted better-than-expected fiscal second-quarter sales and earnings, but guided analysts lower for the current quarter.Qualcomm stock jumped 2.4% in after-hours trading Wednesday. During the regular session, Qualcomm fell a fraction to 52.61 on the stock market today. Qualcomm shares are 7% below their 50-day moving average, a bearish signal.Results: The wireless-chip maker earned $1.34 a share excluding items, up 29% year over year, on sales of $6 billion, up 8%, in the three months ended March 26. Analysts were expecting Qualcomm to earn $1.19 a share on sales of $5.9 billion in the March quarter.Outlook: For the current quarter, Qualcomm expects to earn $1.03 a share on sales of $5.7 billion, based on the midpoint of its guidance range. Wall Street had been modeling for the San Diego-based company to earn $1.10 a share, down 5%, on sales of $5.95 billion, down 1%, in the June quarter.Qualcomm provided a wide guidance range for its fiscal third quarter because of uncertainty related to its Apple business in light of pending legal disputes between the companies. It set an earnings-per-share target of 90 cents to $1.15 and a sales target of $5.3 billion to $6.1 billion.""Apple's contract manufacturers reported, but underpaid, royalties in the second quarter of fiscal 2017,"" Qualcomm said in a news release. ""However, our revenues were not negatively impacted as the contract manufacturers acknowledged the amounts are due and the underpayment was equal to the amounts that Qualcomm has not paid Apple under our cooperation agreement that are currently in dispute.""Qualcomm said it is not clear whether Apple's contract manufacturers will underpay royalties owed it in the fiscal third quarter, which could negatively impact its financial results.""Our guidance range for fiscal third-quarter EPS is wider than our typical practice primarily due to this uncertainty,"" Qualcomm said.Earlier Wednesday, Rosenblatt Securities analyst Jun Zhang lowered his rating on Qualcomm to neutral from buy on concerns that Apple (AAPL) will slash its use of Qualcomm chips in its upcoming iPhone 8 in favor of Intel (INTC) product.RELATED:Qualcomm Sliced On Apple; Broadcom May Team Up For Toshiba Unit

301,QCOM,"XThe stock market remained in rally mode on Thursday with the Nasdaq leading the way, rising 0.7% vs. the S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average's gains of more than 0.6%. Volume rose modestly on the NYSE, but edged lower on the Nasdaq vs. the same time Wednesday. Among the Dow industrials, American Express (AXP) boosted the blue-chip index with a near 5% jump after reporting its Q1 earnings late Wednesday. The credit card company cleared both earnings and sales estimates, causing shares to surge back above the 50-day line. The two energy components in the Dow Jones industrials, Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX), followed up with 1% advances apiece as crude oil prices rebounded 0.1% after Wednesday's 3% fall.Among other companies reporting earnings, D.R. Horton (DHI) traded down over 2.3% despite beating fiscal Q2 estimates and raising its full-year revenue guidance early Thursday. D.R. Horton broke out of a cup with handle with a 34.16 entry on Monday, but is now trading below that point. Other homebuilders followed suit. Pulte Group (PHM) reversed from highs to move down 1.7%, while Toll Brothers (TOL) dropped almost 1%.Qualcomm (QCOM) fell 0.6% after reporting its Q2 fiscal results late Wednesday. The wireless chip maker reported better-than-expected sales and earnings, but guided analysts lower for the current quarter. The bearish guidance caused a number of price-target cuts from analysts. Shares are down 20% year-to-date. Starbucks (SBUX) jumped out of a flat base with a 59.64 entry in the stock market today. The coffee maker was upgraded to buy from hold at Stifel. Stifel expects the company to report strong same-store sales growth in the coming quarters.

302,QCOM,"Apple's (AAPL) fiscal second-quarter iPhone sales miss impacted a number of chipmakers that get a large share of their business from the consumer electronics giant, but some didn't feel the pain as much as others.Chip companies with high exposure to Apple include Cirrus Logic (CRUS), which gets about 75% of sales from Apple; Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), 40% of sales; Qorvo (QRVO), 35%; Broadcom (AVGO), 15%-20%; and Qualcomm (QCOM), 15%-20%, according to Oppenheimer.Some suppliers shrugged off the news. Cirrus Logic was flat, near 64.65, in afternoon trading on the stock market today. Skyworks was up 0.8%, near 101.50. Qualcomm was up 2.4%, near 54.50.But Qorvo was down 0.4%, near 68.10, and Broadcom was down 0.3%, near 224.80.""In the seasonally slow iPhone quarters, we expected a limited reaction in the Apple supply chain, as several component suppliers have already reported results, and most investors are looking ahead to the upcoming fall iPhone supercycle,"" Oppenheimer analyst Rick Schafer said in a report.RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani concurred. He said Apple's March-quarter results and June-quarter guidance were ""mostly neutral for Apple's supply chain.""IBD'S TAKE: The IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks contains seven chip industry players, including Cirrus Logic and Nvidia.Even Apple investors appeared nonchalant as the trading day wore on Wednesday. Shares were down roughly 2% at one point but recovered to a meager loss of little more than 0.2% to 147.18 in afternoon deals.Apple late Tuesday said it sold 50.76 million iPhones last quarter, but analysts were expecting 52 million. Unit sales dipped 1% year over year.Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said many consumers are delaying purchases of new iPhones because of speculation about the next-generation model. That handset, the rumored iPhone 8, is expected to be announced in September.Apple's guidance for its fiscal third-quarter implied iPhone sales of 40 million to 42 million units, below Wall Street's estimate of 42.3 million, Schafer said.RELATED:Apple Services, Wearables Growth Offsets Surprise Drop In iPhone SalesSmartphone Sales Pull Back Before Likely iPhone 8 Tsunami

303,QCOM,"Mobile chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM) was slapped with at least seven price-target cuts on Thursday, a day after reporting mixed December-quarter results. Meanwhile, chip gear maker Lam Research (LRCX) received at least six price-target hikes after delivering better-than-expected results for the December quarter.Qualcomm late Wednesday reported fiscal first-quarter results that missed views on sales but beat on earnings per share by a penny. It also gave guidance that was in line with Wall Street's targets for the March quarter.BMO Capital Markets, CFRA Research, Cowen, Pacific Crest Securities, RBC Capital Markets, Stifel and Susquehanna Financial Group all lowered their target prices on Qualcomm stock.Many analysts cited uncertainty for Qualcomm surrounding a pending antitrust complaint by the Federal Trade Commission and lawsuits by Apple (AAPL) over its patent licensing practices.IBD'S TAKE: The IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks includes nine chip industry companies, including Nvidia and Applied Materials.San Diego-based Qualcomm earned $1.19 a share excluding items, up 23% year over year, on sales of $5.99 billion, up 4%, in fiscal Q1 ended Dec. 25. Analysts expected Qualcomm to earn $1.18 a share ex items on sales of $6.12 billion.For the current quarter, Qualcomm expects to earn $1.20 a share ex items, up 15%, on sales of $5.9 billion, up 5%, based on the midpoint of its guidance.Investor focus on the FTC case and Apple lawsuits could remain an overhang on Qualcomm's stock, UBS analyst Stephen Chin said in his research report. He rates Qualcomm as neutral with a price target of 58.Qualcomm stock was down 5% to 54.05 on the stock market today.Lam Research earned $2.24 a share excluding items, up 43%, on sales of $1.88 billion, up 32%, in its fiscal second-quarter ended Dec. 25. Analysts were looking for $2.19 in EPS and $1.84 billion in sales.Fremont, Calif.-based Lam Research late Wednesday also gave bullish guidance for the current quarter.Cowen, Needham, Pacific Crest, RBC Capital Markets, Susquehanna Financial Group and UBS all hiked their price targets for the stock.But Lam stock was down 2.2% to 114.33 Thursday.""Lam continues to demonstrate high demand for its products,"" Pacific Crest analyst Weston Twigg said in a report. ""After posting a record shipment quarter in December, Lam expects another big record in March and roughly flat shipments in June.""There is some investor concern that March will be the peak quarter for Lam shipments, Chin said. But the UBS analyst believes Lam could see shipment growth in fiscal 2018, thanks to strong demand from Chinese firms.Fabless chipmaker Xilinx (XLNX) earned price-target hikes from Jefferies and Pacific Crest after posting better-than-forecast December quarter results late Wednesday.San Jose, Calif.-based Xilinx earned 52 cents a share, up 6%, on sales of $586 million, up 3%, in its fiscal third quarter ended Dec. 31.Analysts were modeling for Xilinx to earn 49 cents a share on sales of $580 million.""Strong execution continues"" at Xilinx, BMO analyst Ambrish Srivastava said in a report. ""We continue to view Xilinx as a fairly unique investment in our coverage, given its position as the only independent FPGA (field-programmable gate array) company, with an unprecedented multinode advantage.""Additionally, Xilinx is beginning to demonstrate success in the emerging data-center opportunity via wins at Baidu (BIDU) and Amazon (AMZN).""He rates Xilinx as outperform with a price target of 66.Xilinx gave March-quarter guidance that was slightly below consensus on sales and implied EPS in line with views.Xilinx stock was down 3.7% to 57.37 Thursday.

304,QCOM,"The major indexes continued to shave some of their early losses in the stock market today. Big caps and techs were doing slightly better than small caps, as the Russell 2000 dropped nearly 0.6%.However, Apple (AAPL) and Nvidia (NVDA) are bucking the decline, with the former up around a penny and the latter rising nearly 0.8% to 104.80 — perhaps affirming that Nvidia does not intend, for now, to surrender a lot of its magnificent gains from last year.Nvidia, which gained more than 200% after clearing a 33.16 cup-with-handle buy point in mid-March 2016, has fallen no more than 17% below an all-time high of 119.93.The Nasdaq composite, dragged in part by a 12% slide to 55.22 in heavy trading by Qualcomm (QCOM), fell as much as 0.6% in the early going but shaved the overall loss to around 0.2%. The S&P 500 was off 0.4% and the Dow Jones industrial average less than 0.3%.Volume is running lower on both major exchanges vs. the same time on Friday, which saw weekly and monthly options expire.The U.S. equities' losses appear normal during a market that has been in a solid uptrend since a rare Day 3 follow-through took place on June 30, as noted in the IBD daily Big Picture column. Meanwhile, the minor losses compared with the sell-off overseas (Japan's Nikkei 225 down 1.3% overnight, and Germany's DAX off 0.7%) suggest that U.S. equities are still in demand among institutional investors.Returning to Apple, shares in the largest public company in the U.S. financial markets hit as high as 120.81 — up as much as 2.2% from a new 118.12 cup-with-handle buy point — before turning tail.In a prior breakout that took place Sept. 14, Apple moved nicely past a 110.33 buy point in a deeper cup with handle and rose 7.5% before pulling back to form its latest base. All of such action is positive following its emergence from a deep bottoming-base-type pattern.Qualcomm, which is being sued by Apple for alleged unfair treatment regarding the pricing of its chip technology, gapped sharply below its rising 200-day moving average yet seems to be getting buying support near the 55 price level.Watch to see if the stock can try to rebound back near its 200-day line, currently near 61, over the next week or two. At 23% off its 52-week peak of 71.62, the stock definitely now has even more work to build a new base, but the decline is still within normal range for cup, double-bottom and saucer-type patterns.Qualcomm may also be able to stem its slide if it posts robust fourth-quarter results, due Wednesday after the close. The San Diego-based big-cap tech is seen boosting profit 22% to $1.18 a share, helped in part by the fact that in the year-ago quarter, earnings slumped 28%.In the past two quarters, Qualcomm increased earnings by 17% and 41% on the back of accelerating revenue growth (up 4% and 13%, respectively), thus ending a four-quarter year-over-year slump in earnings.Like Apple, Qualcomm itself has showed signs of a budding turnaround by sculpting a massive, deep bottoming-base pattern. In a bottoming base, a former leader tends to correct at least 30% to 40% or more in price, although the declines can be as sharp as 70% to 80%, as seen during the bear markets of 2000-2002 and 2008-2009. Oil companies also went through a bear market of their own after crude oil futures peaked in the summer of 2014.In Qualcomm's case, the stock dived from a multiyear high of 81.97 in July 2014 and dropped as much as 48%, to a low of 42.24 by February 2016. But shares immediately hopped back above the key 10-week moving average, then crossed above the longer-term 40-week moving average several months later.In doing so, Qualcomm shares broke through a long-term downtrend, and in the week ended July 22, nearly a month after the Nasdaq's June 30 follow-through, cleared a 56.37 buy point within a long saucer-with-handle-type base.Monday's severe drop essentially caps a round-trip of Qualcomm's 27% rally since that bottoming-base breakout.RELATED:The Latest Important News On Apple: Go To IBD's Tech News SectionHow To Trade: Will The Top Dividend Plays In 2016 Shine Again In 2017?How To Trade Apple: What Are Apple's 3 Possible Next Moves?How To Trade Nvidia: When Did This Top Chip Play Show Signs That A Correction Is Imminent?How To Trade Stocks: Timeless Tips From Legendary Investor Gerald Loeb

305,QCOM,"The stock market closed modestly lower Monday, a day that saw a few breakouts by big caps Home Depot  (HD), Texas Instruments (TXN) and Adobe (ADBE).Indexes finished well off their session lows, but not enough to quench all losses. The Nasdaq fell a fraction, the Dow Jones industrial average 0.1% and the S&P 500 0.3%. The Dow transportation average slid 0.9%.Volume was lower across the board, early numbers showed.Sparse few stocks were up in unusual volume, while many saw busy trading on the downside.The stock down with most volume was Qualcomm (QCOM), which plunged 13%, touching the lowest level since July. The sell-off followed news that Apple (AAPL) sued Qualcomm over a licensing dispute. On Monday, Nomura Instinet piled on by downgrading Qualcomm to neutral from buy.Aetna (AET) tumbled 3% after a federal judge blocked its planned acquisition of Humana (HUM). Shares of Humana rose 2%.Adobe climbed past the 111.19 buy point of a base-on-base pattern. But the stock closed below that entry, with a minor gain. Volume was below average and the relative strength line is lagging — two dampers on the otherwise bullish move.Home Depot closed 2% higher, as the home improvement chain broke out past a 137.42 buy point in volume 30% above average.Texas Instruments climbed above the 75.35 buy point of a flat base. It closed in buy range. Volume was about 15% above normal — not particularly a rush of institutional buying.

"
306,QCOM,"The new Trump administration has already lined up the first shots in a clash of trade titans.Calling China ""the most protectionist country"" among major U.S. trading partners, Wilbur Ross, Donald Trump's choice to run the Commerce Department, on Wednesday signaled new tariffs for Chinese steel and aluminum industries dumping their products in the U.S. at artificially low prices.That gave U.S. steel stocks a one-day boost. But if the protectionist rhetoric and actions continue to ratchet higher, U.S. companies with a big China presence, such as Apple (AAPL), General Motors (GM) and Boeing (BA), could get caught in the crossfire.China, via the state-run Global Times, has already warned that it could target Apple, Boeing and Starbucks (SBUX) if Trump followed through on his campaign rhetoric by slapping a 45% tariff on U.S. imports from China.China accounts for about 4.8% of S&P 500 revenue, according to FactSet. But many big U.S. companies rely on China for at least 10% of revenue — some more than 50%. They could take a disproportionate hit if the conflict intensifies. Some other companies with broad exposure to China include Intel (INTC), Qualcomm (QCOM), Nike (NKE) and Las Vegas Sands (LVS), according to an IBD review of company filings.Deteriorating trade relations with China wouldn't only risk near-term revenue but also future growth plans. Starbucks, for example, now has about 2,400 stores in China but envisions having 5,000 by 2021. China needs 6,840 airplanes valued at $1 trillion through 2035, Boeing says.Markets still see a full-fledged trade war as unlikely and Trump's harshest threats as part of his negotiating strategy. The Eurasia Group, which analyzes political risk for investors, wrote that it expects the Trump administration to ""aggressively accelerate the pace of anti-dumping, anti-subsidy and other unilateral actions against specific Chinese imports, but they will not adopt across-the-board tariffs in order to maintain room for a negotiated solution.""In the near term, that wouldn't necessarily be a major departure. President Obama imposed a 35% tariff on Chinese tires in 2009, citing a surge in imports, and anti-dumping duties on imports of Chinese solar panels and cold-rolled flat steel.IBD'S TAKE: Donald Trump has made a number of threats on trade, from targeting specific companies to sweeping tariffs. Here's what Trump has the power to do on Nafta, China and taxes.Yet Eurasia Group analysts Evan Medeiros and Michael Hirson write that China is likely to ""retaliate immediately and proportionally"" with the goal of inflicting ""substantial but not overwhelming pain on U.S. firms"" to persuade Trump not to take broader, more destabilizing steps. Among the likely targets are ""iconic American consumer goods"" and companies in agriculture, aviation, financial services, tourism and technology.They note that China has myriad ways to create trouble for American companies, from regulatory actions, to delaying or denying approval for licenses, to blocking an M&A deal.American companies already feel that Beijing is making their lives more difficult. A survey by American Chamber of Commerce in China out this week found that 81% of members felt less welcome than before vs. 77% a year ago, while 24% said the investment environment was improving and 31% said it was getting worse.If Trump used his trade leverage to push China to ensure a more level playing field for American companies in China, that could help their growth prospects. Yet he appears more interested in using his leverage to convince Apple to shift much of its production to the U.S., even if that substantially raises the cost of an iPhone.No company has more at stake in China than Apple, which accounted for $46.4 billion in sales in its latest fiscal year, or 22% of total revenue. And China is where most of its iPhones are pieced together.Global Equities Research analyst Trip Chowdhry is a rare analyst who thinks Trump will prevail upon Apple to significantly ramp up iPhone production in the U.S. for the domestic market. ""Companies who are America First — Made in the USA by the USA workers — will outperform the rest,"" Chowdhry wrote.Yet Chowdhry, recognizing that domestic production would hike costs and likely lower margins, concludes: ""Days of share buybacks and dividends are over.""UBS analyst Steve Milunovich considered a far different trade outcome in which Trump signs onto the House GOP's plan to cut the corporate tax rate to 20% and apply a 20% tax on the value of imports. Under this scenario, tax reform would be a net negative for Apple, with an outright earnings decline coming from a tax on the value of iPhones it imports to sell in the U.S. and lower foreign earnings due to an associated rise in the dollar.Yet for all the hand-wringing, Apple shares are up about 8% since the November election.GM's joint ventures with China totaled $45 billion, or 30% of total revenue, in the latest fiscal year. In December, China hit GM with a $29 million fine for price-fixing, leading to speculation that the fine carried a political message for the incoming president.Yet Eurasia Group figures that GM and Ford (F) may be less vulnerable to retaliation from China because their Chinese joint-venture partners would also suffer.More than half the wireless chipmaker's $23.6 billion in revenue came from China in the latest year, though that reflects China's lead in mobile phone production, not just its large base of end customers. The San Diego-based company has been on a roll lately — especially in China — making inroads with Chinese phone makers after it agreed to pay Beijing $975 million in 2015 to settle an antitrust probe of its licensing practices.If China wants to send a message to Trump, it could stall Qualcomm's acquisition of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), a Dutch maker of chips for the automotive market as well as mobile devices. NXP CEO Rick Clemmer told Barron's that China could delay the deal if trade frictions rise, but he sees almost no chance it will be blocked.Sales of Boeing aircraft to China, which amounted to $12.6 billion in the latest fiscal year, support 150,000 jobs for American workers, the company boasted in December to underscore the risk of a deepening trade rift.Few companies represent a bigger or simpler target than Boeing. Morningstar and Eurasia Group analysts have warned that China could shift its business to Airbus, rewarding Europe as it penalizes the U.S.Wynn Resorts (WYNN) and Las Vegas Sands both get close to 60% of their revenue from their China properties in the autonomous Macau coastal region of China. Both have just opened new casino resorts in the world's biggest gambling market, increasing their exposure. Trump, a onetime casino mogul himself, has a long association with their bosses. Steve Wynn is a finance chair of Trump's inaugural committee, while Sands CEO Sheldon Adelson is a GOP megadonor. Trump's infrastructure spending agenda and his pledge to use Caterpillar (CAT) and Deere (DE) equipment to build a wall on the southern border helped boost shares of the long-suffering construction vehicle maker. But Caterpillar, which gets about 8% of its revenue directly from China, is wary about the implications of a trade war.Caterpillar's outgoing CEO Doug Oberhelman expressed concern about ""being held out of a lot of the markets"" like China as retaliation for Trump's saber-rattling.Macquarie Research analyst Sameer Rathod downgraded the shares after their run-up last month, noting that Trump ""being aggressive on anti-dumping duties would be detrimental to global growth and trade and is likely going to be a negative for aggregate commodity demand.""RELATED:Amazon, Alibaba, Ford, Wal-Mart May Offer Trump-Proofing PlaybookWhy Trump Tax Reform Could Hurt Alibaba, Other ADRs

308,QCOM,"LAS VEGAS – Mobile chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM) late Tuesday introduced a smaller, more powerful processor to run next-generation smartphones as well as augmented reality headsets and other mobile devices.The Snapdragon 835 system-on-chip is the first 10-nanometer node processor, Keith Kressin, senior vice president, product management, Qualcomm Technologies, said at a pre-CES press conference. The big consumer electronics trade show formally runs Thursday through Sunday, though media events began Tuesday.The Snapdragon 835 is 35% smaller than its predecessor, the Snapdragon 820. That will allow smartphone makers to pack more functionality or battery life into their devices, Kressin said.IBD'S TAKE: Usually, though not always, the chip industry is well represented on the IBD 50 list of top-performing stocks. See which chipmaker currently leads. Hint: Its CEO gives a CES keynote Wednesday evening.The new mobile chip also uses 25% less power than the previous chip.""That's a massive improvement generation to generation,"" Kressin said. Smartphone owners will get two and a half hours of additional use each day with the new chip, he said.The Snapdragon 835 was designed for better performance, longer battery life, faster connectivity and better image capture, Kressin said.The chip integrates gigabit-class LTE cellular speeds and multigigabit Wi-Fi speeds, he said.In addition to smartphones, Qualcomm envisions the Snapdragon 835 being used in VR and AR headsets, IP cameras, wearables, tablets and personal computers.The first announced products to use the Snapdragon 835 chip will be the ODG R-8 and R-9 augmented reality smartglasses from Osterhout Design Group.Jewelry designer Swarovski said it plans to use the chip in a new smartwatch to be introduced in March.The Snapdragon 835 is in production now and is expected to ship in commercial devices in the first half of 2017.

312,QCOM,"Artificial intelligence and deep learning are shaping up as the next big paradigm shift in computing and several major chipmakers are poised to benefit, Mizuho Securities analyst Vijay Rakesh said in a research report Wednesday.""We believe deep learning and AI with parallel processing (are) driving broad industry adoption as the enterprise segment looks to use available, real-time data to learn, predict, and prepare for contingencies better and faster,"" Rakesh said. Deep learning, machine learning and artificial intelligence are ""being broadly adopted in health care, manufacturing, automotive, finance, insurance, banking, and retail.""Graphics chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) is ""well-positioned for the next decade"" in the market, Rakesh said. He also sees opportunities for Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Intel (INTC) to provide field-programmable gate arrays.Also, mobile chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM) could grab a slice of the market with its Zeroth platform for on-handset deep learning using its Snapdragon processors, he said.IBD'S TAKE: Nvidia is the top-ranked company on the IBD 50 list of superior growth stocks. Other chip stocks on the IBD 50 include Microsemi and MaxLinear.As AI starts to permeate enterprises, it will grow to the size of the server and data center market, Rakesh said. The global server market is worth about $50 billion a year now.""Intel has noted only 1% of servers today are dedicated to AI, and it is a market expected to grow 12x over the next four years,"" he said.While AI frameworks need graphics processing units for high-performance computing, there will be a need for FPGAs for other uses, he said.""While machine learning will revolutionize traditional insurance processing, health care, hospitals, banking and retail, one of the largest revolutions will be a 'learning car,' "" he said. Learning car technologies range from advanced driver assistance systems to self-driving cars.Rakesh rates Nvidia, AMD, Intel and Qualcomm stocks as buys. He has a price target of 115 on Nvidia, 13 on AMD, 42 on Intel and 75 on Qualcomm.

313,QCOM,"ETF investors bet big on technology stocks ahead of earnings reports from marquee names in January. Powered by demand for the iPhone 7 Plus, Apple (AAPL) delivered supersize results on Jan. 31 and saw its shares soar.Technology was the strongest S&P 500 sector in terms of flow of money as the new year got underway, according to Sector SPDRs. Investors last month poured $897.3 million into Technology Select Sector SDPR (XLK), the largest and most active exchange traded fund for exposure to this sector.This marked a significant reversal from 2016, when investors yanked nearly $900 million from XLK for the year, said Dan Dolan of Sector SPDRs. Trading activity in XLK so far this year suggests that ETF investors are ""very bullish"" on the technology sector, in his view.""In addition to the flows, the short positions declined by 27%"" in January, Dolan told IBD via email. ""Earnings have been very good,"" he pointed out, ""for most of the big names.""Those names include Microsoft (MSFT) and Intel (INTC) — tech stalwarts reinventing themselves for a new cloud-driven, Internet of Things era — as well as chipmakers Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Texas Instruments (TXN), Microsemi (MSCC), Lam Research (LRCX) and KLA-Tencor (KLAC).Outliers included Alphabet (GOOGL) and Qualcomm (QCOM), which delivered mixed results.Tech earnings are tracking higher, at 9.6%, than the 6.6% expected at the start of the Q4 season, according to CFRA Research. And XLK's 4.3% year-to-date gain, vs. 1.8% for SPDR S&P 500 (SPY), reflects investors's optimism about improving industry fundamentals.While earnings season has put technology companies under a spotlight, the macro outlook is driving interest too.Technology stocks are expected to benefit from the economic strength that tends to go hand-in-hand with periods of rising interest rates.""As business spending picks up, as consumer confidence grows and consumption increases, tech companies will be the beneficiaries of those trends,"" said Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF research at CFRA. Other tailwinds include the promise of corporate tax reform and repatriation of foreign cash under President Trump, which disproportionately benefits the tech sector, Rosenbluth pointed out.Apple CFO Luca Maestri noted at Tuesday's earnings call that 94% of his company's record $246.1 billion cash pile is stashed abroad. Under a Trump proposal, the iPhone maker could potentially bring home foreign earnings at a special tax rate of 10%, instead of up to 35%. That tax holiday could be one of the single biggest catalysts for the sector going forward, CFRA analysts say.Risks to the sector include the uncertainty surrounding Trump's vision for economic renewal, the crimp that a strengthening dollar could put on global IT spending, and the onslaught of low-cost rivals such as Huawei in key foreign markets.Investors who remain bullish on the sector's outlook have four dozen ETFs to choose from. Many of the new launches make extremely focused bets in extremely small industry niches — 3D printing or Big Data or wearable devices, for example.In Rosenbluth's view, most investors would do well to stick with a technology ETF offering broadly diversified exposure to the sector, and to then layer on thematic ETFs in specific tech industries.Investors have been seeking diversification. Two tech ETFs far outpaced their peers last year by gathering more than $1 billion apiece in fresh assets, and both hold a broad basket of tech stocks. But they take markedly different approaches to investing in the sector.Vanguard Information Technology (VGT) tracks a market-cap-weighted index of U.S. tech companies, including more small- and microcap stocks than most other broad tech ETFs. It invests $10.75 billion in assets across 366 stocks for an extremely low 0.10% expense ratio.First Trust Nasdaq-100 Tech Sector (QTEC) follows an equal-weighted index of Nasdaq-listed U.S. technology stocks. It has virtually no exposure to small- and microcap stocks, but has a significant midcap stake. At 0.60%, its expense ratio is among the highest in the segment.Investors should be aware that ETFs may sound alike but offer very different exposures, which affects their performance, Rosenbluth says.QTEC rose 25% in 2016, nearly double the gains of its Vanguard peer. It benefited in part from its extreme overweight to the semiconductor industry.Looking ahead, Rosenbluth believes VGT may benefit more than other broad-based peers from an improving U.S. economy, given its larger stake in smaller tech companies.XLK and VGT made a 52-week high on the stock market on Jan. 27.RELATED:High-Yield Strategy Uses 10 ETFs To Deliver All-Weather Income With Low Risk7 Best ETFs For Your Growth And Income Needs As Trump Takes The Wheel

320,QCOM,"U.S. antitrust officials late Tuesday accused mobile chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM) of using anticompetitive tactics to maintain its monopoly in baseband processors used mobile phones.The Federal Trade Commission filed a complaint against Qualcomm in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.The FTC alleges that Qualcomm has used its dominant position as a supplier of baseband chips ""to impose onerous and anticompetitive supply and licensing terms on cell phone manufacturers and to weaken competitors.""The complaint alleges that Qualcomm threatened to disrupt cell phone makers' supply of baseband processors to obtain elevated royalties and other license terms for its standard-essential patents.IBD'S TAKE: Qualcomm stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 85, meaning it has outperformed 85% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months. But it ranks No. 18 out of 39 stocks in IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Fabless industry group. For more information on Qualcomm, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.Qualcomm forced Apple (AAPL) to use its chips exclusively in return for lower licensing fees, unfairly cutting out competitors, the FTC said. Qualcomm precluded Apple from sourcing baseband processors from Qualcomm's competitors from 2011 to 2016, regulators said.The FTC is seeking a court order to undo and prevent Qualcomm's unfair methods of competition in violation of the FTC Act. The FTC has asked the court to order Qualcomm to cease its anticompetitive conduct and take actions to restore competitive conditions.The commission vote to file the complaint was 2-1, with Commissioner Maureen Ohlhausen dissenting.Qualcomm (QCOM) shares tumbled Tuesday after Bloomberg reported that the U.S. antitrust lawsuit was imminent.Qualcomm stock fell 4% to 64.19 on the stock market today.

It's also is the subject of investigations in the European Union and Taiwan.Last month, South Korea fined Qualcomm 1.03 trillion won ($886 million) for what it called monopolistic practices in technology licensing.The South Korean Fair Trade Commission said Qualcomm used its market dominance in key chip fields to force smartphone makers to license a broad array of patents, often more than needed.Qualcomm also didn't pay fair amounts for using other wireless chip patents and it refused to license certain patents to other handset makers, the government said.Qualcomm makes most of its profit from selling the rights to use its patents, which are essential for mobile phone systems. It has been criticized for its royalty rate demands and licensing conditions.RELATED:CES: Qualcomm CEO Hypes 5G Wireless As RevolutionaryQualcomm Introduces First 10-Nanometer Mobile Chip

Consumers can use spoken commands to control TVs, streaming music players, thermostats, lighting and other things. With gadgets like Echo, users can ask questions and do web searches by asking questions aloud and getting spoken responses.At CES 2017, consumer electronics products using Alexa included smart speakers from Lenovo and Monster, refrigerators from LG Electronics, washers and dryers from Whirlpool (WHR), lamps from General Electric (GE), and robotic vacuum cleaners from Samsung, to name just a few.Apple and Microsoft were left in the dust in terms of broadening the use of their voice-based virtual assistants, based on third-party products shown at CES. While Amazon, Google and Microsoft had some level of official participation in CES, Apple was a no-show, as usual. It didn't exhibit, have a private meeting room or participate in panel discussions at the show.Several news articles noted that Apple's lack of a presence at CES was particularly damaging for the company if it wants to create an ecosystem around its Siri voice assistant or HomeKit smart home software.Still, Apple stock rose 0.92% to 119 in the stock market today, in a buy zone from a buy point of 118.12 first touched on Friday, and trading at a 13-month high. Microsoft stock fell 0.32%, while Nvidia stock rose 4.1%.RELATED:Nvidia Leads Broad Chip Sector Gains, Gets CES BounceCES 2017: News From The World's Largest Consumer Tech Show

337,QCOM,"South Korea on Wednesday fined Qualcomm (QCOM) 1.03 trillion won ($853 million) for antitrust violations, following a similar move by China, raising questions about the wireless chipmaker's royalty revenues and sending shares lower in premarket action.Qualcomm used its market dominance in key chip fields to force smartphone makers to license a broad array of patents, often more than needed, the South Korean Fair Trade Commission said, justifying the record fine by the country. Qualcomm also didn't pay fair amounts for using other wireless chip patents, the government said. And it refused to license certain patents to other handset makers.Korea is home to Samsung Electronics, the world's No. 1 handset maker, as well as LG Electronics, another big user of Android operating software by Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL). The verdict makes it likely that Qualcomm may have to accept lower royalty payments, which account for the bulk of its profit.Qualcomm, for its part, rejected the charges.""This is an unprecedented and insupportable decision relating to licensing practices that have been in existence in Korea and worldwide for decades and that the KFTC reviewed but did not question in a previous investigation of Qualcomm,"" the company said in a statement.IBD'S TAKE: Mutual funds and other institutional buyers drive stocks by accumulating shares over time. Qualcomm, Applied Materials and chemicals firm FMC are key holdings for USAA Growth & Income Fund. USAA Growth & Income has outperformed its large-cap blend peers in 2016.Qualcomm expects to appeal the ultimate written decision. However, the company in February 2015 settled a China antitrust probe with a $975 million fine. And later it accept lower license fees in that country.The European Union a year ago accused Qualcomm of making ""significant"" payments to an unnamed big phone and tablet maker to use it chipsets exclusively as well as selling chips below cost to undercut smaller rival Icera, now owned by Nvidia (NVDA).U.S. and Taiwan regulators also are investigating the company.Apple (AAPL) is another notable wireless chip technology customer for Qualcomm.Qualcomm shares fell 2.2% to 65.75 on the stock market today after closing Tuesday just below their 50-day moving average. The stock hit a two-and-a-half-year high of 71.02 on Oct. 27.Apple shares fell 0.43% Wednesday. Nvidia, up 29% over the prior 10 sessions, fell 6.9% to 109.25.

342,QCOM,"The $1.6 billion USAA Growth & Income Fund (USGRX) has picked up steam. Its 13.44% gain this year going into Thursday tops 75% of its large-cap blend rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc. That's better than its 8.53% annual pace over the past three years, which beats 56% of its peers.The fund has received some of its drive from holdings like Applied Materials (AMAT), a semiconductor equipment and software maker that is up 75% year to date and has IBD's top Composite Rating of 99; and smartphone chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM), which is up 34% this year and has a good 85 Comp Rating.IBD'S TAKE: Chemicals maker FMC, which is up 46% year to date, is another holding helping to drive Growth & Income. FMC's third-quarter earnings per share growth of 60% beat analysts' estimates. As IBD recently reported, it guided for full-year EPS of $2.76 to $2.86 a share, above consensus forecasts for $2.75.One reason for the fund's stronger showing this year is the spark it received from a rally in energy names like Cimarex Energy (XEC) and EOG Resources (EOG).Another reason is that its financial services stocks got a good bump up from the November election, in part on the expectation that the Republican victories would lead to a lighter regulatory burden on banks, says Michael Nayfa, assistant manager of the 40% fund sleeve run by a team from subadvisor Barrow Hanley Mewhinney & Strauss. At the same time, interest rates have been rising in anticipation of the Federal Reserve's rate hike this month. Higher rates have improved banks' net interest margins and profit outlook.For example, SLM (SLM), the private education-loan originator better known as Sallie Mae, is up 70% this year. It gapped up 18% the day after the election, and is up 56% overall since the election. The stock has a sterling 91 Comp Rating.Money center bank Morgan Stanley (MS), with a 96 Comp Rating, is up 36% this year and 27% since the election.The fund's management approach, with two separate sleeves of securities run independently of each other, is a two-heads-are-better-than-one strategy. Basically, it doubles the number of best ideas the fund can have.USAA's John Jares and John Toohey, who run a 60% sleeve, have been making changes since taking the helm of their segment of the fund from a subadvisor on Nov. 20, 2012. Since then, they have employed a more concentrated approach with their sleeve, trimming it to 60-80 names from its prior range of about 130-150, Jares says. And their top 10 holdings now tend to account for 30% to 50% of their sleeve. That's up from 20% or less.The idea is to boost the contribution to fund performance from their best ideas. ""Too much diversification is negative,"" Jares said.Jares and Toohey began their current stake in Applied Materials in Q1 2013, while the semiconductor industry was still under pressure from the financial crisis. Applied had completed a combination with Varian Semiconductor in 2011. After that, Applied began to cut costs, Jares says. ""They also increased R&D and began to get more products through their pipeline,"" Jares said. ""Now they have gained market share since the combination with Varian.""The Barrow Hanley sleeve focuses more on value-oriented stocks than the Jares-Toohey sleeve. That means hefty weights in financials and health care. But the Barrow Hanley sleeve also holds what assistant manager Michael Nayfa calls value technology names. ""Those are stocks that pay high dividend yield, have high free cash flow and that trade at reasonable valuations,"" Nayfa said.Microchip Technology (MCHP), for instance, has a dividend yield of 2.2%. Its shares are up 40% this year and within 2% of its all-time high.""It's a semiconductor company that is predominantly in microprocessors,"" Nayfa said. ""It's gaining market share across the auto and industrial spaces.""Microchip acquired Atmel early this year. ""We like the deal,"" Nayfa said. ""It's a good fit. Atmel gives them a foothold in 32-bit processors, which some (investors) argue they are behind in. This deal can be 20% to 25% accretive to their earnings. Microchip has a proven record of buying and integrating assets. They do a good job at cost synergies. It can be hard to reduce costs without losing business, but they do it.""RELATED:Check Out This Top Mutual Fund's Portfolio

343,QCOM,"A late-afternoon downdraft of selling pinched the stock market's gains on Monday, yet the overall trading carried a generally quiet tone with less than two weeks left in the year.Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) and Nvidia (NVDA) continued to show oomph in their recent rallies. The former gained 0.6% to 116.64, creeping closer to a potential new breakout at 118.79; the latter rallied 1.2% to 101.63 and made a new high.Nvidia is also extended from any proper buy points, yet still points to solid demand from institutional quarters for tech stocks overall.The Nasdaq composite rose nearly 0.9% to as high as 5483 in the first 90 minutes of trading before fading to a gain of less than 0.4%. That's on top of a 3.6% advance two weeks ago and a slight dip last week. The Nasdaq 100 slightly outperformed, up just slightly more than 0.4%.The S&P 500, hampered by steep declines among toy, newspaper, metal ore, agricultural chemical and shipping stocks, edged just 0.2% higher. The Dow Jones industrials gained 0.2%. Small caps outperformed big caps as the Russell 2000 rallied more than 0.5%.At 1371, the Russell is up 20.8% since Jan. 1, outpacing the S&P 500's 10.7% year-to-date gain.Apple initially broke out of a cup with handle at 110.33 within a long bottoming pattern, and has now rallied strongly enough to create a potential base-on-base pattern.The new base carries a 118.79 entry. On Monday, IBD reported that Apple may feature a curved OLED display in its next-generation iPhone, matching what its rival Samsung Galaxy 7 Edge already has.Nvidia, meanwhile, is currently making the sort of run that Apple was capable of doing when it broke out of an early-stage base with a 24.94 buy point (before splits) in March of 2004. Over the next 11 months, Apple rose 264% to a high of 90.88 before making its next significant correction. Over the next six months, the iPhone maker built a new base that featured a 27% decline from high to low.That decline fell within the normal parameters of cup and double-bottom bases. It also showed that long-term underlying demand for Apple shares back then was incredibly strong.Fast-forward to today, and Nvidia has gone on a similar style of big price run. Since clearing a cup with handle at 33.17 in mid-March, Nvidia has taken roughly nine months to boom 209% higher to an all-time high of 102.45 set on Monday.Thus, those who bought shares at that prime entry of 33.16 have the luxury of deciding on holding the stock through the next normal correction. All great stocks eventually correct in price and form bases (launchpads for potential new breakouts) en route to superior long-term gains.The recent growth acceleration seen in Nvidia's fundamentals should tilt the investor toward a longer-term hold objective.Earnings per share have grown 13%, 18%, 21%, 39%, 56% and 104% vs. year-ago levels in the past six quarters. That's a rare show of rapid acceleration in the size of profit increases and is a sign that the designer of semiconductors is doing something special.Nvidia has two main products — the GPU (for graphics) and Tegra processors — that serve customers in the gaming, professional visualization, data-center and automotive markets.In the third quarter, Nvidia reported an 87% jump in Tegra processor revenue to $241 million as GPU revenue climbed 53% to $1.7 billion. As for product segments, automotive revenue jumped 61% to $127 million while data-center revenue soared 193% to $240 million.Yahoo Finance on Monday named Nvidia company of the year.Also in the stock market today, Qualcomm (QCOM) rose nearly 0.7% to 66.95 and is trying to rally back above its key 50-day moving average. Qualcomm, which has plans to acquire industry peer NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), is also showing fine growth acceleration (EPS down 26%, then rising 17% and 41% in the past three quarters).Revenue fell 19% in the first quarter of this year, marking a fourth quarter in a row of falling sales, but then rebounded 4% in Q2 and 13% to $6.18 billion in Q3.In the business software and entertainment field, Microsoft (MSFT) continues to show stunning strength. The megacap tech hopped 2.1% higher to a new high of 63.62, climbing further past a 58.80 buy point within a base-on-base formation.Find the 58.80 exact entry by adding 10 cents to the Aug. 26 intraday high of 58.70. In the flat-base portion of the base on base, the stock declined just 5% from that intraday high.The operating-system king and maker of the popular Xbox video-game console is on track to post its biggest profit increase in more than three years.

It is not among the eight chip stocks on the IBD 50 list of top growth companies.The transaction will combine inertial, pressure, microphone and ultrasonic wave sensor technologies from InvenSense with TDK's pressure, temperature, electric current and other sensors.San Jose, Calif.-based InvenSense is best known as a provider of motion sensors for smartphone makers, including Apple (AAPL) and Samsung. It also makes sensors for wearables, game devices, cameras and drones.TDK plans to pursue sensor fusion, the combination of multiple sensor technologies and software for advanced products.""Our strategic goals are aligned, and we are confident that together with TDK we will accelerate our roadmap to provide next-generation sensor technologies in key fields for the world's most innovative companies,"" InvenSense CEO Behrooz Abdi said in a statement.The TDK-InvenSense deal is the latest in a flurry of chip M&A activity this year.On Nov. 21, Macom Technology Solutions (MTSI) announced plans to buy Applied Micro Circuits (AMCC) for $770 million.On Nov. 2, Broadcom (AVGO) announced a deal to acquire Brocade Communications Systems (BRCD) for $5.9 billion.On Oct. 27, Qualcomm (QCOM) announced plans to buy NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) for $39 billion in the largest semiconductor M&A deal ever.RELATED:Nvidia Soars To Record High On Big Price-Target HikeApplied Materials Downgraded; 3 Other Chip Gear Makers Rated Buy3 Chip Companies Named Top M&A Targets In 2017

348,QCOM,"Some of Silicon Valley's biggest companies are trying to smooth over frictions with President-elect Donald Trump, but the soon-to-be tweeter-in-chief's possible protectionist trade measures and strained relations with China could spell trouble for the tech industry.Trump met with 14 tech leaders on Wednesday, and the tech summit's main topic included China. Those attending included the CEOs of Apple (AAPL), Amazon.com (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), Cisco Systems (CSCO), Microsoft (MSFT), Tesla (TSLA) and Intel (INTC). Facebook's (FB) No. 2 exec also attended. But few details about the closed meeting were revealed.Trump, who took shots at Apple, Amazon and tech in general during the campaign, looked to forge some common ground with the tech leaders. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, in the only public comment by a tech attendee, called the meeting ""very productive."" At the meeting's start, which was open to the press, Trump complimented the industry and said he wanted to help it do well.But Trump is off to a rocky start with China's government, starting with a breach of long-held protocol by accepting a phone call from Taiwan's president. China claims Taiwan as part of China, and the U.S. has officially recognized ""One China"" diplomatic relations since 1979. The Trump camp has suggested the One China policy could be used as a bargaining chip to win future trade concessions.During the campaign, Trump promised to brand China a currency manipulator. He warned of slapping a 45% import tariff on all Chinese goods.IBD'S TAKE: Netflix is a current member of the exclusive IBD Leaderboard, where only the very best stocks at or near buy points reside. Netflix has a conventional buy point of 129.39, but investors willing to be more aggressive should check out Leaderboard for some more information.If Trump follows through and elevates the international status of Taiwan and enacts protectionist trade measures, China's government would retaliate, observers say. China did protest Trump's phone conversation with Taiwan's president.U.S. tech, and other, companies should be ""plenty worried"" about Trump's statements, says Nicholas Lardy, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. But if Trump's words don't turn into action, it could blow over. China will hold Trump more accountable once he's sworn in as president on Jan. 20, Lardy says.""He's not president yet,"" Lardy said. ""There are a lot of things China could do, but I don't think they will do any of them until there's something that goes beyond rhetoric.""Talking about how he's going to be a hard deal maker, all these things are not going to set the Chinese off on a path of retaliation immediately. But if it becomes more concrete than just rhetoric, at that point you could see retaliation in the commercial sphere. There are lots of screws they can turn on U.S. companies.""China's possible retaliatory actions include case-by-case enforcement of anti-monopoly laws and business regulations, slapping tariffs on U.S. goods and favoring European multinationals in purchases. China also could put an economic embargo on Taiwanese products.One worry for Silicon Valley is that Trump's transition team and early Cabinet appointments have few ties to the tech industry. Trump has focused on manufacturing jobs, not the digital economy. Wilbur Ross Jr., selected to head the Commerce Department, is well-known for deals in the steel and coal industry.Trump has named Gov. Terry Branstad, R-Iowa, as his ambassador to China. Branstad calls President Xi Jinping of China an ""old friend."" Lardy, though, says it's not clear how much of a ""moderating effect"" Branstad will have on Trump's dealings with China.Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group (BABA) has warned Trump about raising trade barriers. And a Chinese state-run newspaper warned in November that companies such as Apple and Boeing (BA) would be among the first to be punished if a trade war erupts.For its fiscal Q4 ended Sept. 24, Apple garnered 19% of its revenue from the Greater China region, which includes Hong Kong. Amid tougher competition from local smartphone makers, Apple's revenue from China, Hong Kong and Taiwan fell 30% year over year in the quarter to $8.8 billion. The was by far its worst-performing region, but Apple has high hopes for its business in the world's biggest nation.Chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM) gets some 38% of revenue from China, says a JPMorgan report. Qualcomm in 2015 agreed to pay a $975 million fine as part of a settlement with Chinese antitrust authorities that probed its licensing deals.IBM (IBM), Cisco and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) head a long list of computer companies that could be impacted by a U.S.-China trade battle, as well as chipmakers Intel and Micron Technology (MU) and data storage product makers such as Western Digital (WDC) and Seagate Technology (STX).Some companies have already been harmed from revelations by Edward Snowden that U.S. tech firms' products have been used by the National Security Agency for spying. China's government responded by telling state-owned companies to buy more local equipment.One wild card is whether Trump can be more helpful to U.S. companies aiming to crack China's market than the Obama administration.Video streamer Netflix (NFLX) recently shelved its expansion in China, saying ""the regulatory environment for foreign digital content services in China has become challenging.""IBM, Intel and Microsoft have complained of Beijing pressure to hand over the keys to intellectual property to win more business.China's censorship and monitoring of social networks has stymied U.S. internet firms. Google pulled out of mainland China in 2010. Facebook, anxious to break into China, has developed censorship tools designed to let the nation's regulators suppress content, according to reports from the New York Times and others.Cable TV firm Comcast (CMCSA), which acquired movie studio DreamWorks in April, is ""very, very bullish"" on its China business, Steve Burke, CEO of Comcast's NBCUniversal, said on the company's earnings conference call in July.""I'm talking movies, television, consumer products and theme parks,"" Burke said.Comcast is on track to open a new theme park in Beijing, with local partners, in 2020. Meanwhile, China is poised to become the world's No. 1 film market.Then there are companies like Visa (V) and MasterCard (MA) that have a stake in trade relations. China last year said it would open up its fast-growing electronic payments market, including bank card transactions, to foreign companies. China has been under World Trade Organization pressure to open up its payments card business since 2001.One risk for U.S. companies is that joint ventures on the mainland could be put on ice if trade frictions rise. Wang Jianlin, China's richest man and chairman of real estate and entertainment giant Dalian Wanda Group, has warned Trump of trouble if Chinese acquisitions of U.S. assets are blocked.Since China joined the World Trade Organization 15 years ago, U.S. exports to China have risen by more than 600%, while U.S. exports to the rest of the world rose by 80%, Andy Rothman, investment strategist at Matthews Asia, told IBD in an email.The U.S. ran up a $366 billion trade deficit with China last year, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. It has been declining, but Trump aims to lower further.""Many American jobs and corporate profits would be lost if China would retaliate against new tariffs, including in the Republican-leaning Farm Belt, as China is the second-largest market for American agricultural exports, led by soybeans,"" Rothman said. ""Prices for goods sold at places such as Wal-Mart (WMT) might rise by 10% or more.  That would hurt the spending power of Trump's working-class political base.""RELATED:Apple, Palantir Among Loose Ends At Trump Tech SummitApple Hits Great Wall Of iPhone Competition In ChinaAlibaba Singles Day Breaks Record, But Growth SlowsChina GDP Rises 6.7% In Q3, Same As Q2, Q1

350,QCOM,"More telecom companies will follow in the footsteps of Verizon Communications (VZ) by making acquisitions targeting the Internet of Things in 2017, forecasts market research firm Analysys Mason.  ""Telecom operators will be under pressure to grow IoT revenues faster, possibly through acquisitions,"" said Analysys Mason in its 2017-outlook research report.Verizon aims to sell software and services, not just access to its communications network.Verizon and rival AT&T (T) are targeting the Internet of Things, including web-connected cars and telematics services, as a growth market. IoT also encompasses advanced robotics, telemedicine, automated factories, smart cities and the development of massive sensor networks in such fields as agriculture.IBD'S TAKE: Verizon stock outperformed in the first half of 2016 owing to its high dividend, then swooned in Q3. Shares have gained 10% since the presidential election on expectations that regulation will ease in a Trump administration. Verizon stock has gained 14% in 2016. Learn more at IBD Stock Checkup.""Verizon was one of the few operators to make bold moves in 2016, spending over $3 billion on its acquisitions of Fleetmatics, Telogis and some other smaller firms,"" the report said. ""Other operators may follow Verizon's lead in 2017.""Verizon in August acquired Fleetmatics Group for $2.4 billion. Fleetmatics sells cloud-based commercial fleet and mobile workforce management products.Verizon stock finished trading up 1.2% to 52.91 on the stock market today, at a three-month high near 53. Verizon stock, which is trading well above its 50-day moving average and last week moved above its 200-day average, has a buy point of 56.95.Verizon in September acquired Sensity Systems, a provider of smart city products.Verizon's IoT revenue in Q3, excluding Fleetmatics, increased 24% from Q3 2015, to $217 million. ""Revenue from IoT accounts for less than 1% of most operators' total revenue. It will take until 2025 for IoT to exceed 5% of operators' total revenue,"" forecasts Analysys Mason.In other IoT deals in 2016, Qualcomm (QCOM) purchased NXP Semiconductor, targeting autonomous cars, and Japan-based SoftBank acquired wireless chip designer ARM Holdings.Cisco Systems (CSCO) bought Jasper in March for $1.4 billion, gaining a cloud-based IoT platform.RELATED:Verizon M&A Talk Swirls; Charter Stock Up, Yahoo DownWhy The Race To Wireless 5G?

352,QCOM,"It's that time of year again – when analysts and journalists make wild predictions for corporate mergers and acquisitions in the year ahead.Most of the time they're way off. Sometimes they're right on the company being bought but wrong on the acquirer. But they're always entertaining. (Check out last year's tech M&A predictions for 2016.)The biggest tech acquisitions of 2016 included AT&T (T) announcing plans to buy Time Warner (TWX) for $85.4 billion, Qualcomm (QCOM) agreeing to purchase NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) for $47 billion, SoftBank picking up ARM Holdings for $31.4 billion, and Microsoft (MSFT) acquiring LinkedIn for $26.2 billion. Another notable deal was Verizon's (VZ) agreement to buy the core assets of Yahoo (YHOO) for $4.8 billion, though that price might get negotiated down.Which companies will be next to tie the knot? Who knows? But here are some interesting guesses.The staff of entertainment bible Variety says Walt Disney (DIS) could make a bid for internet TV network Netflix (NFLX).""Disney CEO Robert Iger made his name with gutsy, big-ticket acquisitions — most notably, Pixar, Marvel Studios, and Lucasfilm,"" Variety wrote. ""He's set to retire in mid-2018, but first, with Disney's cable TV revenues faltering, he's intent on finding a solid and sustainable online platform for the company's world-beating assets.""Look for him to make one last big deal — perhaps a $60 billion-plus buyout of Netflix? — to put the Mouse into a brand new digital house, and to secure his legacy as one of entertainment's most transformative CEOs.""Variety isn't alone in thinking Netflix will be in play in 2017.The staff at Fortune magazine also says Netflix could be purchased in the new year.""There have been plenty of rumored suitors for Netflix, including Apple (AAPL), Google (owned by Alphabet (GOOGL)) and even Disney,"" Fortune wrote. ""Any company in the entertainment space drools at the company's millions of subscribers and its growing stable of movies and TV shows. ... While it would take a suitor with very deep pockets, Netflix may have to go courting if its stock price starts to flag.""Fortune noted that Netflix CEO Reed Hastings has said he doesn't want to sell. But Netflix's ballooning content spending could force his hand.Peter Csathy, founder and chairman of media advisory firm CREATV Media, also expects Netflix will be sold next year.""Consider this the 'AT&T Effect,' as the titans of both technology (platforms) and content (creators) react to the $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner,"" Csathy said in a blog post. ""Verizon is already rumored to be eyeing CBS (CBS).  And Netflix's long-term vulnerability means that active discussions will take place in 2017 to buy it (Disney already was rumored to be interested in 2016).""Don't be surprised if one of the usual suspects is that potential buyer (Apple, Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (FB), Google/YouTube, Verizon), or even some less usual suspects (such as massive international player Alibaba (BABA))"".Twitter (TWTR), the microblog social network and Donald Trump's favorite bully pulpit, was up for sale in 2016, but suitors got cold feet over its valuation, slowing growth and problems with online harassment.If Twitter can spruce up its business, suitors are likely to come calling again in 2017.Eric Jhonsa, tech columnist for TheStreet, says Twitter will get purchased next year. Twitter ""feels like it has a lot of untapped potential that could be realized by a company that knows how to revamp the microblogging platform's user experience and better leverage its content,"" he wrote.Jeff Reeves, lead writer and editor for InvestorPlace.com, does not expect Twitter will be acquired in 2017. ""Twitter is a money-losing niche product with no growth path – not to mention a tarnished brand and a part-time CEO who isn't exactly a change agent,"" Reeves wrote.Scott Kessler, head of technology research at CFRA Research, hedged his bets.""We think at least one of the following companies will announce its pending acquisition by a third-party in 2017: Angie's List (ANGI), Pandora (P), Twitter and Yelp (YELP),"" he said in a research report Thursday.Action-camera maker GoPro (GPRO) also is likely to be snapped up in 2017, Jhonsa predicted.GoPro is struggling with declining sales, but still has a loyal base of core users and a valuable, well-recognized brand, he said.GoPro investors are running out of patience, Jhonsa said.Aditya Kaul, research director at Tractica, agrees that GoPro will get hitched in 2017.""Leading candidates for acquisition are Apple, Google, Samsung, and possibly (Snapchat owner) Snap Inc. Camera manufacturers like Canon (CAJ) and Nikon could try and wade in to this market, as well,"" he said in a report.Chris Nolter, senior writer for TheStreet, expects that Sprint (S) will resume its pursuit of T-Mobile US (TMUS).""With a Republican administration in place, Sprint Chairman Masa Son likely has T-Mobile US CEO John Legere on speed dial,"" Nolter wrote. ""Son's SoftBank invested $21.6 billion in Sprint in 2013 with the goal of merging with T-Mobile US and creating a strong competitor to AT&T and Verizon. Regulators under Obama pushed back against the deal. Not wasting any time, Son has already had a photo op with the President-elect in Trump Tower and pledged to invest $50 billion in the U.S.""But Fortune says Comcast (CMCSA) will buy T-Mobile in 2017.""T-Mobile has been by far the fastest-growing U.S. wireless carrier since John Legere took over as CEO in late 2012, and has more than doubled its subscriber base, to 69 million,"" Fortune said. ""Sprint made a run at the company in 2014, but antitrust regulators waved it off. That likely wouldn't be an issue for a buyer like Comcast, which has said it plans to offer a wireless service in 2017.""Top 10 Trends To Watch For 2017: From Trump To Apple iPhone 8Telcos Seen Following Verizon's Lead In Making IoT AcquisitionsAdvertising, Marketing To Invade Virtual, Augmented Reality In 2017Tech Startup Bubble Predicted To Burst In March, April Time Frame

355,QCOM,"Samsung Electronics will create an all-screen front for the Galaxy S8 smartphones coming out next year and scrap the physical home button in an effort to battle back against main rival Apple (AAPL), people with direct knowledge of the matter said.The bezel-less displays will provide more viewing real estate while a virtual home button will be buried in the glass in the lower section, the people said, asking not to be identified because the details haven't been released. The new phones will come only with wraparound displays using organic light-emitting diode — or OLED — technology, the people said.Samsung declined to comment.Samsung needs the Galaxy S8 to be a hit after suffering through the Note 7 debacle that tarnished its brand, led to an embarrassing recall and may cost the company more than $6 billion. The world's biggest smartphone vendor is already under pressure from Chinese vendors while Apple is said to be planning to adopt OLED screens, which are thinner and use less power than liquid-crystal screens while also offering deeper colors.While Samsung is targeting a March release of the S8, that could be delayed until April, the people said. Samsung is adopting tougher testing procedures in the wake of the Note 7 debacle that could push back the launch by about a month, one of the people said.""Since the phones have a record of burning up, it needs time for these phones to be verified as safe. How safe the phones turn out to be is more important than any hardware innovation,"" said Greg Roh, an analyst at HMC Investment Securities. ""It will take about a month or two for people to actually start opening their pockets.""For years, manufacturers have been seeking ways to reduce the size of bezels — which frame the screen and typically provide space for speakers, buttons and cameras — in order to make smartphones smaller while increasing the size of their displays.Samsung isn't the first to do away with the feature. In October, China's Xiaomi showed off its Mi Mix concept phone developed with designer Philippe Starck that has a display covering 91% of the front.Samsung has built a physical home button into every previous model in the Galaxy S range. Apple moved to a pressure-sensitive home button with the iPhone 7 that provides a vibrating sensation when pressed instead of an actual click.Apple plans to ship at least one iPhone using OLED next year, featuring a new look that extends glass from the display to the device's back and edges, a person familiar with the plan said last month. It's also said to plan a virtual home button.The changes to Samsung's screens will be housed in devices of a similar size to the preceding model, the 5.1-inch S7 and 5.5-inch S7 Edge, the people said. Some of the phones will use Qualcomm's (QCOM) Snapdragon 835 chips while others will feature Samsung's own Exynos processors, the people said.Samsung also plans to introduce an upgraded digital assistant that will use voice commands to send text messages, make phone calls and provide daily appointment scheduling. The Suwon, South Korea-based company acquired U.S.-based artificial-intelligence software company Viv Labs in October and said last month that its new S8 will come with AI-enabled features ""significantly differentiated"" from those in the market. Viv was founded by the developers of Apple's Siri.In the three months ended September, Samsung reported a 17% slump in net income from the impact of the Note 7 recall. The company has predicted a multibillion dollar hit to earnings in the December and March quarters as well.The company is considering scrapping plans for a dual-camera on the S8 due to higher manufacturing costs, one of the people said.

357,QCOM,"Amazon (AMZN) was the fastest-growing recipient of utility patents granted to U.S.-based companies in 2016, followed by Intel (INTC), Ford (F) and Microsoft (MSFT).But as has been the case for 25 years, IBM (IBM) had the most utility patents granted by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, with a record 8,088, up 10% from 2015, according to according to IFI Claims Patent Services, which compiles an annual patent list.Following IBM with most U.S. patents granted, in order, were Samsung, Canon, Qualcomm (QCOM) and Google-owner Alphabet (GOOGL). Most patents fit into the utility category, which encompasses the mechanical, electrical and chemical fields. Utility patents protect the way inventions are used and work.Amazon has received plenty of headlines for its voice-activated Echo device. At the CES trade show in Las Vegas last week, numerous companies announced that they are using the Echo digital assistant from Amazon, with Alexa voice-response technology. Amazon has taken an early lead with its Echo device, ahead of rivals such as Alphabet's Google Assistant, Microsoft's Cortana and Apple's (AAPL) Siri, in what is shaping up as the next big computing platform.According to IFI, 2016 saw a record 304,126 utility patent grants, up 2% from 2015.

359,QCOM,"LAS VEGAS – Voice-based user interfaces are becoming a huge deal and Amazon.com (AMZN) has taken a commanding lead.At CES 2017, numerous companies announced that they are using Amazon's Alexa voice-response technology to control their devices with spoken commands. Alexa is the technology that powers Amazon's Echo smart speakers.Alexa has jumped out ahead of rivals such as Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google Assistant, Microsoft's (MSFT) Cortana and Apple's (AAPL) Siri in what is shaping up as the next big computing platform.Amazon is using Alexa to boost its e-commerce business and add functionality to products like Echo and Amazon Fire TV. Google sees voice user interfaces as a threat to its web search business. (As much as 25% of web searches are now driven by voice.) Meanwhile, Microsoft and Apple are using voice to improve their operating systems.Voice-based user interfaces allow for hands-free control of devices. Consumers can use spoken commands to control thermostats, lighting, streaming music players and other gadgets. With gadgets like Echo, users can ask questions and do web searches by asking questions aloud and getting spoken responses.Amazon reportedly has sold about 5 million Echo speakers to date.Amazon is pushing hard to connect Echo to other devices throughout the home to create a broader ecosystem.Since it opened up its Alexa technology to third-party developers in June 2015, over 7,000 applications (or ""skills"") have been created, Mike George, vice president of Amazon.com's Alexa unit, said at an LG Electronics press conference on Wednesday.LG announced that it has added Alexa to its Smart InstaView refrigerator, which features a 29-inch touch LCD display. With Alexa voice services, people can ask the refrigerator to search for recipes, play music, check the weather, add items to a grocery list, place orders through Amazon.com and other tasks.Among the many consumer electronics products using Alexa at CES were smart speakers from Lenovo and Monster, lamps from General Electric (GE), washers and dryers from Whirlpool (WHR), home safety and security products from First Alert, kitchen appliances from Gourmia and lawn sprinklers from Rachio.NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) was at CES to show off chips with embedded voice technologies for access Amazon Alexa and Google Home. It is helping device manufacturers that want to add voice capabilities to products like coffee pots and microwave ovens, but lack the in-house expertise. Qualcomm (QCOM) is in the process of buying NXP for $47 billion.The four-day CES conference ends today.RELATED:Amazon Alexa, Vocal Computing Get Heard At CES 2017

360,QCOM,"Institutional investors continued to show a healthy appetite for stocks in late afternoon trading Tuesday and Apple (AAPL) as the iPhone giant and fellow megacap techs helped send the Nasdaq composite into new high ground.Apple rallied more than 2% to 115.62 and got closer to a potential second buy point of 118.79 in a base-on-base entry. The initial entry was 110.33 from a cup with handle, and the stock is now getting extended from the old buy point. The two bases form part of a long bottoming base process in the former huge market winner.The Nasdaq composite at one point rose more than 1.3% and hit an all-time high of 5486, extending its year-to-date gain to more than 9% with nary three weeks left in the trading year. The Nasdaq 100, comprising the 100 largest nonfinancial companies, jumped more than 1.5%.Other indexes lagged the Nasdaq, yet still joined the upside. The S&P 500 gained 0.7%, helped by big gains by stocks in the newspaper, automaker, international oil exploration, internet retailing, generic drug, internet content, desktop software and telecom consumer products industries.The NYSE composite was up 0.5% as selloffs in medical software, metal ores mining, specialty steel, trucking, oil drilling, heavy construction and mortgage REIT stocks buffered that index's ascent. The Dow Jones industrials also rose 0.5%. The Russell 2000 fell 0.1%.Volume was running higher on the Nasdaq and lower on the NYSE vs. the same time on Monday. Apple originally staged a breakout on Sept. 14, moving past a 110.33 entry within a multimonth cup with handle. The breakout was good enough to send shares up almost 8%, but the stock then faded and did a round-trip.However, Apple got critical buying support at the 200-day moving average and never triggered the golden rule of selling — that is, cut your losses short in every stock at 7%-8% or less.The reason for that?Research by IBD founder and Chairman William O'Neil shows that when you buy a stock properly as it breaks out, if it's destined to become a great winner, capable of gains of 20%, 200% or more, then it rarely falls 7%-8% below the proper buy point.Analysts are posting bullish commentary not on the iPhone 7 being sold today, but the next edition, the iPhone 8. As pointed out in the IBD Click tech blog, Citi Research analyst Jim Suva foresees a major iPhone upgrade cycle next year.Meanwhile, the company continues to innovate with brand-new products and may see serious revenue pickup in the long term in emerging new markets such as India.Apple's 56 RS Rating is normal for a big-cap stock that has lumbered through a long base. When a stock forms a shorter base in the span of 13 weeks or less and has already made a big move, you'd expect the Relative Price Strength Rating to be well north of 90.Apple's 0.9 up/down volume ratio, as seen in IBD Stock Checkup, is not terrible and thus gets a cautionary yellow dot at Stock Checkup, but you'd like to see that go up and eclipse the neutral 1.0 level.Other companies to watch in the stock market today with the potential of staging fresh breakouts include:Qualcomm (QCOM), up 2% to 69.79: The wireless chip expert is getting near a 71.72 flat-base entry.Adobe Systems (ADBE), up 1% to 106.15: The No. 1 firm in digital content creation software is retaking its 50-day moving average and may be forming a new base on base with a 111.19 entry. The stock gained 10% past an earlier entry at 100.66 before retreating last month. Adobe reports fiscal Q4 results Thursday.Intel (INTC), up 1.8% to 36.62: The leader in microprocessors has regained its 50-day line and is forming a cuplike pattern since peaking at 38.36 on Oct. 10. Prior to that, the megacap had rallied nearly 16% after surpassing a long saucer with handle base at 33.10 on July 7.Applied Materials (AMAT), up 0.2% to 32.07: The chip equipment titan is still in buy range after a successful test of buying support near its recent flat-base buy point of 31.17. To find the proper entry in a flat base, add a dime to the highest price within the base, which is usually on the left side of the pattern.The 5% chase zone in Applied extends up to 32.73. The IoT phenomenon could play well into Applied's hands as more devices get connected to the internet and some translate digital information into physical movement via chips called actuators. More demand for chipmaking equipment would boost Applied's fortunes.  The Street sees FY 2017 profit jumping 37% to $2.39 a share and sales rising 17% to $12.7 billion.Applied's fiscal year ends in October.Applied scores a 93 EPS Rating and an equally bullish 89 Relative Price Strength score.RELATED:How To Spot The Bottoming Base, Part IHow To Spot The Bottoming Base, Part IIWhich Stocks Are Joining Apple In Attempting New Breakouts?

361,QCOM,"Stocks showed small movement Monday, but small caps fell harder with the Russell 2000 retreating nearly 1.1%. In contrast, the S&P 500, up 3.1% last week, lost just 0.1%.Apple (AAPL), meanwhile, fell around 0.6% to 113.30. More importantly, the stock held above its key 50-day moving average. And Intel (INTC) helped prop up chipmakers with a 0.7% gain to 35.97. Intel has been working on a new saucerlike base since peaking at 38.36 in October.The Nasdaq composite dropped 0.6% on Monday, following last week's 3.6% rally, but volume on fell about 6% vs. Friday's level, according to preliminary data. That's a sign that big funds weren't overly eager to sell positions and raise cash.The NYSE composite outperformed by losing just 0.1%. Big Board turnover grew. The S&P 500 was also off just 0.1% while mega-cap names were virtually flat. Due to the small declines, the 500 avoided getting tagged with a new distribution day, or bout of heavy professional selling. The distribution count on the 500 is now at 2, down from 8 on Nov. 1, according to the IBD Market Pulse table found in each daily Big Picture column.A low distribution day count implies that large funds, banks, pension plans and the like are accumulating shares on net. The Accumulation/Distribution Rating on the S&P 500 is positive at C+ as of Friday's close.The S&P 100 was up a fraction while the Dow Jones industrials edged 0.2% ahead.Oil and gas royalty trust, oil drilling, and international oil and gas exploration companies paced the upside with gains of 1% or more. IBD's Medical-Diversified group, which includes Dow 30 component Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), and the Internet-Network Solutions group also excelled with gains of 2% and 1%, respectively.J&J jumped nearly 3% to 115.36 in heavy turnover, stopping short of retaking its 50- and 200-day lines. The stock is just 8% below a 52-week peak, but it's still in the early stages of forming a potential new base.The worst declines in terms of industry groups belonged to department store chains (down more than 4%), airlines (-3%), leisure products (-3%) and steel production (off more than 2%). Southwest bank, cement and aggregate, security software and consumer loan companies also sold off hard.Back to the tech sector, Microsoft (MSFT) rose 0.3% to 62.17, extending its gains from a breakout past a 58.80 base-on-base buy point to 5.7%. The mega cap is now slightly extended past the 5% proper buying range.Qualcomm (QCOM), which makes the IBD Dividend Leaders screen, gave up little ground as it builds on gains since a July 21 breakaway gap past a bottoming base buy point of 56.37. Yet the stock may also be working on a new flat-base-like structure. Qualcomm was also showcased in today's The Income Investor column.Netflix (NFLX) continues to show tight action after a strong rally last week. Down just 5 cents on Monday to 122.83, the video streaming giant is still above an aggressive entry point near 120, according to IBD Leaderboard. The standard buy point is 129.39.In the energy sector, numerous oil and gas explorers struggled to hold big opening gains in the wake of another surprise agreement among non-OPEC oil-producing nations to join in the body's historic decision to cut overall production starting in January.Britain's integrated oil major BP (BP) rallied more than 1% to 36.51, at one point getting as high as 36.96, or just a few cents above a 36.93 cup buy point. The eight-week cup sits within a much longer and deeper bottoming base pattern. Halliburton (HAL) ran up to a session high of 56.08 before sinking back to 54.49, up just 0.5%. The oilfield services giant, however, has climbed more than 16% since clearing a 47 flat-base buy point in early October.At one point, Halliburton pulled back below the 47 entry to an intraday low of 45.08, but that 4% drop was not enough to trigger the 8% loss-cutting sell rule following a good breakout.Wall Street sees Halliburton reversing from a net loss of 5 cents a share in 2016 to a net profit of $1.03 a share in 2017.The week features only a sliver of companies reporting quarterly results, but they include two major big-cap software names, Oracle (ORCL) and Adobe Systems (ADBE). The latter is expected to grow fourth-quarter profit 39% to 86 cents a share. Over the prior six quarters, earnings have grown on average 53.2%.In August, Adobe pushed past a 100.66 flat-base entry point and rallied more than 10% before fading. Yet in its most recent correction, the stock found bullish support at the long-term 200-day moving average. Watch to see if the stock can hurdle its 50-day moving average, which would boost the odds of a fresh breakout.Besides the upcoming Federal Reserve decision on interest rates on Wednesday, keep an eye out for the November report on producer level prices. The Econoday consensus forecast calls for a 0.2% month-to-month rise.RELATED:Why Did Apple Form A Bottoming Base, And How Can Investors Profit From It?Why Apple Is Forming A New Base And Flexing Strength AgainWhy Is Adobe A Top Tech Stock Pick For 2017?Will Apple Invest In A Massive Softbank Fund?

362,QCOM,"If you're generating steady income from a dividend stock, it doesn't matter what the company's fundamentals or technicals look like. Or does it?Many income investors may be content with a steady dividend payer even if the stock is a laggard when it comes to price performance. But stock price depreciation could erase some or all of that dividend income each quarter. To maximize your total return, it makes sense to focus on potential outperformers that offer a payout.""Without question, the most important factors income investors should look for with dividend stocks are fundamental factors,"" Robert Johnson, president and CEO of The American College of Financial Services, told IBD. ""In recent years, the price-earnings ratios on these stocks have been driven up to historically high levels ... because high-quality bonds were simply not providing the level of yields that many investors were looking for.""Click Here For A List Of Top Performing Dividend StocksSo how should one search for quality dividend stocks? IBD's daily Dividend Leaders, REIT Leaders and Utility Leaders screens offer a good starting point. The companies making the screens meet certain fundamental criteria and pay a yield in line with or higher than the S&P 500's average, which is currently 1.99%. But don't forget to conduct further due diligence.Special Report: Dividend And Income InvestingCheck out the company's earnings growth as well as sales. Is it one of the leaders in an outperforming industry group? Is there recent news that could affect the company?Study its price and volume action on a chart. Bookmark The Income Investor column and check back for an in-depth look at a different dividend stock each day.IBD's proprietary Composite Rating is a useful tool to quickly identify quality stocks. It takes a stock's key ratings — Earnings Per Share, Relative Strength, Sales + Profit Margins + Return on Equity, Accumulation/Distribution — and combines them into a single rating on a scale from 99 (best) to 1 (worst). The rating also takes into consideration price performance by measuring how far a stock is from its 52-week high. The closer it is to the high, chances are its overall rating will be higher.Be sure to keep an eye on the overall market as well as news or other factors that could affect a stock's industry group. For instance, the Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise interest rates by a quarter-point at its Dec. 13-14 monetary policy meeting.""Investors should operate under the premise that rates will rise, not only in December, but for the foreseeable future,"" Johnson said. ""I would expect financial stocks — banks and insurance companies, in particular — to benefit the most from the expected increase in rates.""In fact, bank stocks have staged a strong rally since midyear as the likelihood of higher rates increased.President-elect Trump's proposals for tax cuts and increased military and infrastructure spending could affect dividend stocks too.""If he is able to push this agenda through, it would likely lead to an increase in inflation and higher inflation rates,"" Johnson said. ""As rates increase, we will likely see a rotation out of high-dividend yielding stocks and into the bond market.""The accompanying chart shows the Dividend Leaders with the biggest year-to-date price gains through Dec. 8.Topping the list is Oneok (OKE), which has surged 134% this year to nearly 58. The Tulsa, Okla.-based natural gas gatherer has a hefty 4.3% dividend yield. And its dividend growth rate is 22%. Shareholders would have soundly beaten the market twice with this stock — in terms of stock price appreciation and a big yield. Per-share earnings fell 17% last year as oil and gas transport/pipeline stocks skidded, but analysts expect a 12% EPS gain this year and 8% in 2017. Fair warning, though: This stock has been no steady eddy and must be watched. It plunged from a peak of 71.19 in September 2014 to a low of 18.24 in December 2015.That's followed by Spectra Energy (SE), another natgas gatherer and distributor, up 72% year to date to about 41. Shares are working on a flat base with a potential buy point at 44.10. The stock is 6% off its 52-week high. The Houston-based company's payout is 4% on an annual basis. Full-year profit slipped the past two years but is projected to resume growth with a 1% increase this year and 21% the next. Spectra yields 4.0% and has a dividend growth rate of 9%.Chip designer Qualcomm (QCOM), which has seen its share price rise 37% this year to 68.33, also made the list. The San Diego-based company has paid dividends each year since 2003; its current annualized yield is 3.1% and its dividend growth rate is 22%.Qualcomm has posted double-digit earnings growth the past two quarters after four quarters of year-over-year declines. That trend is expected to continue with a 22% EPS gain in the current period and 15% in fiscal Q2.Hasbro (HAS) has advanced 29% so far this year to 86.78 as it shapes the right side of a base with a potential entry at 88.63. The Pawtucket, R.I.-based toymaker offers a 2.4% dividend yield and a dividend growth rate of 10%.It has a three-year earnings growth rate of 13% and an Earnings Stability Factor of 12 on a scale of 0 (most stable) to 99 (least stable). Analysts forecast EPS will rise 18% this year and 9% the next.A few S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats — companies that have increased their dividends each year for the past 25 consecutive years — make the list too. Illinois Tool Works (ITW) and Sysco (SYY) are two such classic income plays. They have advanced 37% and 33% this year, respectively, and pay annualized dividends of 2% and 2.4%.RELATED:Flexibility Is Needed For New Era Of Income InvestingProfits From Stock Gains And Augment A Low-Yielding Portfolio

363,QCOM,"Fresh from a holiday season that saw 4K ultra-HD TVs and Amazon (AMZN) Echo smart speakers among the hot-selling items, the consumer electronics industry is about to make its annual splash to show off its candidates for the Next Big Thing.At CES 2017, artificial intelligence, augmented reality and voice-controlled technology are expected to be among the hot topics of conversation.The annual consumer electronics trade show in Las Vegas officially runs Jan. 5 — 8, but preshow events start Tuesday.Produced by the Consumer Technology Association, CES will be celebrating its 50th anniversary with the 2017 show.The CTA expects the massive industry confab to draw more than 165,000 attendees and over 3,800 exhibitors covering more than 2.5 million net square feet of floor space. But the association is known for providing conservative guidance. CES 2016 reached a new attendance record, attracting 177,393 industry professionals from 158 countries. Organizers have been working to limit overall attendance to keep the show more manageable.CES 2016 played host to 3,886 exhibiting companies, and they took up nearly 2.5 million net square feet of exhibit space.CES 2017 will feature a diverse set of keynote speakers including the chief executives of cruise line operator Carnival (CCL), sports apparel maker Under Armour (UA) and graphics chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA).IBD'S TAKE: Has Nvidia peaked? The graphics and automotive chipmaker had its biggest decline of the year on Wednesday and continued falling Thursday. Even with that, though, shares have tripled this year and it remains No. 1 on the IBD 50 list of top-performing stocks, a feature that should be on your regular checklist.At CES 2016, fitness wearables, drones, virtual reality, self-driving cars and hoverboards were headliners.The latest advancements of those technologies will be on display at CES 2017, but the tech press always gravitates to the next shiny new thing. After all, what's new is the nature of the news business.Six years ago, CES exhibitors en masse started labeling all their products as smart because they included a processor and connected to the internet. This year, companies are marketing their products as having artificial intelligence, or AI.Among the products at the show being promoted as having AI include cameras, drones, robots, autonomous cars, and even toothbrushes and patio umbrellas.""Artificial intelligence has the potential to be the story of the show,"" John Curran, managing director of Accenture's (ACN) Communications, Media and Technology business told IBD. ""It could be the golden thread that weaves together so much of what's happening at the show.""AI looks to be a core piece of many product categories, combining Big Data analytics, machine learning and natural language processing, he said. AI allows for easy access to information and device controls as well as predictive capabilities for personalized experiences, Curran said.Another big theme of CES 2017 is expected to be products with voice controls and virtual personal assistants.Amazon is poised to dominate the show with its Alexa voice-response technology, which powers its Echo smart speakers. Amazon is working to make Alexa a standard interface across a range of consumer electronics devices.Companies at CES will be demonstrating Alexa voice controls in such products as air purifiers, smartwatches, speakers and sprinkler systems.Amazon is even hosting a series of educational sessions at CES on building next-generation voice interfaces with Alexa.Rival voice-based digital butlers, such as Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google Home and Microsoft's (MSFT) Cortana also will be making their presence felt at the show.""One of the stories to watch at CES will be the platform aspects of these intelligent assistants,"" Curran said.Expect to hear about a lot of product partnerships using intelligent assistants from Amazon, Google, Microsoft and possibly Apple's (AAPL) Siri as those platforms seek to become standards in the home.""This has the potential to be a game changer and unlock a wave of innovation,"" Curran said.Intelligent assistants could spur sales of smart home devices and appliances such as connected thermostats, lighting and home security, he said.Augmented reality systems will be on display at CES 2017 for smartphones, smart glasses, toys, automotive head-up displays and other gadgets. Augmented reality overlays digitally created content into the user's real-world environment.""There's going to be a lot of virtual reality, augmented reality and mixed reality"" at CES 2017, Marjorie Costello, editor and publisher of Consumer Electronics Online News told IBD. ""There are going to be 360-degree cameras so people can create their own content (for VR headsets).""Major chip companies, which provide enabling technologies for consumer electronics, will be touting their latest advances at the show. Intel (INTC), Nvidia and Qualcomm (QCOM) are among those planning a big presence at the CES 2017.Major car companies including Ford (F), Honda (HMC), Toyota (TM) and Volkswagen (VLKAY) also are exhibiting at the show, as are auto tech suppliers such as Mobileye (MBLY), Continental and Valeo (VLEEY).As usual, there are some big no-shows among exhibitors at CES, including Apple and Microsoft, which prefer to do their own product events.Big-screen TVs will remain a staple of the show, with major vendors expected to show off super-crisp OLED TVs and lower-priced 4K TVs with high-dynamic-range (HDR) imaging.RELATED:Amazon Gets Big Boost For Echo As Microsoft Readies A Rival DeviceThe Top Selling Products On Amazon Over Holidays Came From ...

364,QCOM,"Chipmakers Broadcom (AVGO) and Texas Instruments (TXN) re-entered buy zones on Tuesday as semiconductor peers Intel (INTC) and Qualcomm (QCOM) approached their buy zones.Broadcom stock rose 0.71% to 179.43 on the stock market today. For the second time in the last three trading sessions, Broadcom stock hit its buy point of 179.52, where it has encountered resistance after touching a record high of 181.90 on Friday. It has been forming a flat base for 14 weeks.Texas Instruments stock jumped 2.1% to 73.20 on Tuesday. TI stock returned to its buy point of 72.68, following a breakout on Nov. 18 that had reversed. Shares had climbed as high as 75.25 — a more than 16-year high — on Nov. 29 before retreating. TI has been building a flat base for 15 weeks.Intel stock rose 2.3% Tuesday to 36.80. It has been trading above its 50-day moving average for the last four days, moving into the top half of a 10-week flat base. It has a buy point of 38.46.IBD'S TAKE: Broadcom is one of a select few companies to make IBD's Leaderboard list of actionable stocks. Leaderboard cautions that semiconductor stocks can be highly volatile.Qualcomm stock rallied 1.3% to 69.34 on Tuesday. It is approaching a buy point of 71.72 from a seven-week flat base.IBD's 40-company Electronics-Semiconductor Fabless industry group, which includes Qualcomm and Broadcom, rose 1.4% Tuesday, while the 39-company Electronics-Semiconductor Manufacturers group, which includes Intel and TI, rose 0.75%.RELATED:AMD Upgraded, Nvidia Gets Price-Target Hike, But Pacific Crest CautiousIntel, T-Mobile, Honeywell Make Barclays' Top PicksBroadcom Spikes To Record High On Q4 Beat, Raised Dividend10 Chip Stocks Initiated With Buy Ratings, Including Broadcom

366,QCOM,"Small-cap stocks thrived on Friday, yet the market as a whole acted the way it usually does right before Christmas. It made harmless moves, as most senior equity traders have already taken off for the three-day holiday weekend.The Russell 2000 gained 0.6% en route to a mild weekly gain, cutting away some of the prior week's 1.7% sell-off. Among the major indexes, the Nasdaq composite was next best, rising 0.3%.The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average both edged barely higher. Volume was sharply lower vs. Thursday, according to preliminary data.Yet some funds and professionals acted like busy Santa elves in accumulating more shares in one of the top growth vehicles of 2016, sending Nvidia (NVDA) up another 2.5% to 109.78, good enough for a ninth straight up day and new highs.The top chip play has now gained more than 230% from a mid-March breakout from a second-stage cup with handle at 33.17.Meanwhile, Dow 30 component Apple (AAPL) also acted in a positive manner. The megacap tech bounced off a mild intraday low of 115.59 to close a bit higher at 116.52.As noted in a recent Stock Market Today column, Apple has done enough hard work to craft a cuplike base that sits atop another cup-with-handle pattern. That latter pattern was formed out of a long bottoming base.The question for market observers now is this: Will the market show enough strength for new breakouts by Apple and others? Or, will Apple pull back to shake out the last uncommitted holders who have been sitting on paper losses and eager to bail out?That, in essence, is the psychology behind the building of a cup with handle. Remember that a handle should reflect a shakeout, and thus you'll see a downward slant along the lows as a handle forms. With narrow handles, check the slope on a daily chart. The minimum length of a handle on either a cup, double bottom or saucer is five trading sessions, or a week, on a weekly chart.Nvidia represents the future of computing, and the roles of semiconductors to make machines and devices connected to the internet, and enhance people's lives and the workplace.The Santa Clara, Calif., firm also currently boasts superior IBD Ratings, including a 99 Composite at IBD Stock Checkup on a scale of 1 to 99; a 96 EPS Rating; a 99 RS; and a top-flight A for SMR (Sales + Profit Margins + Return on equity).Are there other large-cap companies that more or less match Nvidia's solid ratings? Yes.IBD screened for stocks that have a minimum 98 Composite Rating; a $25 billion market cap or higher; average daily volume of at least 500,000 shares; a full-year EPS growth estimate of 15% or higher; and trading no more than 15% below a 52-week high.In addition to Nvidia, three names show up: Applied Materials (AMAT) (FY 2017 earnings are seen jumping 37% to $2.40 a share), Broadcom (AVGO) (FY 2017 EPS estimate up 20% to $14.09), and Charles Schwab (SCHW) (FY 2016 EPS estimate up 29% to $1.30, FY 2017 up 22% to $1.58).The former two are noted in IBD Leaderboard, with Applied as a watchlist candidate. Schwab ranks No. 24 in the IBD 50.Applied Materials, which may get a boost by the emergence of actuator chips, and Broadcom have fiscal years ending in October. Actuators turn digital signals into physical motion, light, and other forms of ""analog"" activity.Schwab has enjoyed strong gains along with other brokerages following Donald Trump's surprise Nov. 8 election win.Pretax margin at Schwab has surpassed 30% in 2013, 2014 and 2015, up from the high-20s in FY 2010 to FY 2012.Higher interest rates are likely to boost Schwab's income from investments and margin loans.

367,QCOM,"Generating income in the current market environment has been a bit like a carnival game. It can take a lot of effort and the prize may seem of little more value than a cheap stuffed pink elephant with uneven button eyes.Interest rates on Treasury bonds remained near historic lows this year, forcing many income investors to chase yield in junk bonds and dividend-paying stocks.At this point choices for dividend stocks range from those down a lot and offering juicy yields, like energy refiner and marketer CVR Energy (CVI), which is 51% off its 52-week high and has a dividend yield of 10.8%, and transportation services company Scorpio Tankers (STNG), 53% below its high, yielding 12%. At the other end of the spectrum are stocks that have been on the upswing but have less potent yields, such as food giant Archer Daniels Midland (ADM), which is up 22% this year but pays a dividend yield of just 2.7%.Still, dividends could get more appealing. What if tax cuts under President Trump coax corporations to repatriate overseas caches of cash back to the U.S.? Many companies might use the bounty to boost their dividends.Special Report: Dividend And Income InvestingMany companies have already used those overseas cash stashes. Tony Hallada, CliftonLarsonAllen Wealth Advisors (CLA) managing partner, said, ""Corporations issued a massive amount of corporate bonds at record low interest rates that was collateralized by the assets held overseas. Many used the bond-sales proceeds to increase their dividends. This way they could pay out some of this buildup of capital on the balance sheet, borrow at record low rates and avoid paying the taxes on the repatriated money.""The game is changing already. Bond yields are rising as the economy strengthens and the Federal Reserve on Wednesday nears what is expected to be its first rate hike in a year. The 10-year Treasury yield has pushed as high as 2.4% in recent days, a level not seen since July 2015. Boatloads of erstwhile bond investors parked in dividend-paying equities are waiting to jump back into their preferred ""safe"" investment class.But investing in bonds when interest rates are rising can cause principal to erode since bond prices fall when rates rise. And when money moves back into bonds to capture higher yields, it could rush out of dividend-paying stocks that have been bid up to high valuations by income seekers.What's the smart play for retirees and others searching for income?Given today's risks in any one type of bond or income-oriented stock, the secret to winning the income prize is to be flexible. You need a variety of income sources, tilting toward those whose valuations hold steady while they churn out income, and tilting away from those whose prices sag and undercut your total return.You can get higher yield than what's paid by safe blue chip stocks by taking on credit risk. Ditto for bonds; you can get higher yield if you accept higher risk. But odds are you're aiming for a relatively safe balance of yield and risk.Telecom's Verizon (VZ), for instance, is approaching the end of the choppy year with a 9% gain and yielding 4.6%. Chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM) is up 35% and yielding 3.1%.Don't expect the Federal Reserve to help your pursuit. Even with rate hikes, rates will remain near historic lows. And rate hikes can crush securities' prices.""The current environment is murky,"" said Radu Gabudean, a manager of several American Century funds, including $52.6 million Multi-Asset Income (AMJAX) and $16.4 million Global Allocation (AGAVX).Among stocks, sectors that tend to pay higher yield have grown pricey because investors have crowded into them. Among bonds, you have to give up more and more credit quality to find higher yield. Both of those facts threaten your ability to score price gains. You could even end up eating a loss.""Focusing your investments on those equity sectors and in lower-quality bonds is a dangerous investor behavior,"" said Justin Christofel, co-manager of $13.7 billion BlackRock Multi-Asset Income Fund (BAICX).Christofel exhibits flexibility by including covered call options among his fund's income sources. About 13% of its shareholders' money is invested in such options, which aim to minimize the high yield-high risk trap. But 20% to 30% of the fund's yield is from covered calls, he says.The fund's 12-month yield is 4.47% as of Nov. 30, according to Morningstar Inc. That's more than double the 2.08% yield from the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY), a proxy for the popular big-cap stock benchmark.Covered call options are a way to wrest income from stocks that pay few if any dividends.  Individual investors can follow this strategy on their own if they invest the time to shop for worthwhile stocks, arrange an option trading agreement with a brokerage and sell calls on specific stocks.""But it's far easier to have a financial advisor do it for you, or to use a mutual fund that holds them,"" Christofel said.IBD'S TAKE: You can learn more about investing in covered call options in this IBD report.The strategy involves buying a stock and at the same time selling to another investor that stock's potential price gain above a certain specific price. You pocket any gain up to that agreed upon threshold, known as the strike price. The person who bought the option gets any gain beyond that.This strategy generates income through the price — called the premium — the second investor pays for the option. Mutual funds pass those premiums through to shareholders as income in the form of dividends.This income strategy relies on potential share-price appreciation, not dividends paid. That means covered call options help a fund diversify its risks and avoid stocks with cyclically inflated share prices.""We can generate income this way without relying on sectors and geographies that investors are most likely to turn to for dividend income, such as staples, REITs, utilities and telecom,"" Christofel said.In turn, that frees his fund to focus on stocks with better prospects for price gains, improving the fund's overall total return potential.How can you tell if any given mutual fund holds covered call options? It's easier with some funds than others. In its monthly commentary, Christofel's portfolio details the share of income from each of its strategies. As of Oct. 31, the largest slice of its income pie was from covered call options, whose 30% share topped the second-largest source, global high yield bonds at 18%.The covered call option portion of his portfolio customarily yields 10% to 15% annually, he adds. Compare that to the 2.08% average 12-month yield of dividend-oriented stock mutual funds tracked by Morningstar Inc. as of Nov. 30.The strategy only works if the stock you use gains in price. Christofel sees the best opportunities for this tactic at the moment in financial stocks. Also promising are technology, consumer discretionary and industrials.Many additional strategies involve the familiar tit-for-tat, seeking some relatively safe balance of yield and credit risk or market risk. Among them:Linda Duessel, executive vice president and equity markets strategist for Federated Investors, likes stocks that raise their dividends. Payout is not their only benefit. The stocks tend to outperform other stock categories after Federal Reserve interest-rate hikes.""It's common with the first rate hike, and I call the hike that (may come out of) the Fed's next meeting (Dec. 13-14) a 'first hike' because the prior one was a year ago,"" Duessel said.Those stocks tend to climb because rate hikes occur amid economic strength, which helps companies lift their dividends.You can play this strategy through mutual funds or individual stocks. If you go with individual stocks, weigh how much a stock's price has risen in, say, the past year. The higher it has climbed, the harder it will be to score additional appreciation.""This is the category we're having the most discussions with clients about,"" said Terry Simpson, U.S. multiasset strategist for the BlackRock Investment Institute. ""This area offers higher yield with only a small increase in risk. A more stable U.S. dollar can create an opportunity for foreign-currency bonds.""But if the dollar rises in value, that could lure investors away from emerging markets debt, hurting their prices, Simpson cautions. ""An aggressive Fed tightening cycle or a global risk-off situation could threaten the asset class,"" he added.U.S. dollar-denominated emerging markets debt yielded 5.13% on average as of Nov. 30, according to the Bloomberg Barclays Emerging Markets USD Aggregate Bond Index. Its local currency counterpart yielded 5.18%.Attractive yields are this category's driver. But beware of volatility. ""High-yield bonds have been the best-performing category this year, along with emerging markets debt,"" said Adam Kramer, a manager of $42.7 million Fidelity Advisor Multi-Asset Income Fund (FWATX). ""But the year before, high yield was the worst performing.""The category's total return is vulnerable to cycles in sectors where it is highly exposed, such as financials and energy.High-yield bonds averaged a yield of 6.57% as of Nov. 30.Joanna Bewick, manager of two Fidelity Investments income-oriented mutual funds, describes convertible bonds as bonds on steroids. They generate income like bonds, and they offer the price appreciation potential of stocks. Convertible bonds averaged a yield of 3.31% as of Nov. 30.These loans are typically made to large corporations. The loans' interest rates are adjustable, usually every 90 days. That protects the lender in a rising rate environment.Borrowers generally have sound fundamentals. Still, these loans are typically below investment grade. The loans are senior secured debt, which give lenders first claim on the borrower's assets if it defaults. You can play these instruments through loan participation or bank loan mutual funds.Current 12-month yield is more than double the S&P 500's. But total return historically lags the broad stock market over multiyear periods.Elsewhere in our special report on dividend and income investing, you can read reports that offer tips about a wide variety of income strategies:RELATED:Want Income?

"
371,QCOM,"Apple (AAPL) and the iPhone ecosystem owe much of their torrid growth to the 3G and 4G wireless networks that whisked games, apps, photos and video to the computerlike smartphones.Now the 5G, or fifth generation, wireless revolution is near, promising data speeds 50 to 100 times faster than 4G LTE networks. Sure it'll improve smartphones, but that's not the point. Analysts say 5G's biggest impact will be to drive the proliferation of the Internet of Things — billions of connected devices.The business case for 5G is all about IoT, an evolution, or maybe revolution, that will take the internet era into new territories. Companies including chipmakers, network equipment makers and telecom service providers are investing heavily in the technology, with the first products to roll out in 2017.""With 5G, there are going to be many more device categories,"" Matt Grob, Qualcomm chief technology officer, told IBD.IBD'S TAKE: 5G holds big promise for the future, but how are key players performing now? One company worth watching is Arista Networks, a 2014 IPO that is battling Cisco Systems, the longtime networking gear leader. Arista is on the IBD 50 ranking of the top-performing stocks,  a good place to look for stocks possibly worth buying.IoT encompasses such burgeoning arenas as self-driving cars, advanced robotics, telemedicine, automated factories, smart cities and the development of massive sensor networks in such fields as agriculture. Farmers will, for example, know exactly when to harvest for best yields based on air temperature and soil moisture.Many of the companies aiming to put 5G on the fast track — Qualcomm (QCOM), Intel (INTC), Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Verizon Communications (VZ) to name a few — expect new revenue streams from the IoT and game-changing apps outside of smartphones.Qualcomm aims to ship its first 5G modem chips for phones in the second half of 2017, with follow-on chips targeting the IoT.Qualcomm, like others, expects 5G to evolve on multiple tracks: IoT, smartphones and fixed residential. While Apple, Samsung and others will ship 5G smartphones only after standards are rubber-stamped, which observers say will be a work in progress until 2020 or later, carriers are closer with ""fixed"" 5G, a wireless broadband service provided from a fixed point to homes in limited areas. If  fixed 5G to homes works well in trials, Verizon says it will pursue a commercial rollout city-by-city in 2018 and 2019. It hasn't identified the cities yet.With 4G networks, it costs wireless firms about $1 to deliver a gigabyte of data. 5G networks promise much better economics. It also will provide virtually uninterrupted communications for new apps.""5G is going to bring lower costs per bit, lower latency and highly reliable services,"" Grob said. ""So it's going to be great for autonomous vehicles, medical devices and for infrastructure and smart cities. There are more companies taking part in the standards development for 5G than ever.""Medical applications include remote monitoring of devices like EKGs or blood pressure monitors. Smart city technologies include traffic signals that adjust to vehicle flows and sensor-based water systems that test for contaminants in real time.The Internet of Things isn't waiting on 5G. AT&T (T) already has some 8 million web-connected cars linked to its 4G network. U.K.-based Vodafone (VOD) says it had 41 million IoT connections as of Sept. 30. Cisco says its gear links 4.9 billion devices now and will connect 12.2 billion by 2020, and few will be 5G.But the more speed, the better.Some companies might get a good boost early in the 5G revolution, such as makers of network testing gear like Keysight Technology (KEYS). Independent testing is a big part of the standards-setting process.Early on, analysts say Xilinx (XLNX) programmable chips will be useful for prototyping 5G products, while the higher radio frequency bands associated with 5G may create long-term opportunities for RF chip leaders Broadcom (AVGO) , Qorvo (QRVO) and Murata.As small cells are deployed in urban areas, cell tower firm Crown Castle (CCI) and startup Tarana Wireless aim to capture share. Tarana's biggest investor is AT&T. Some analysts view Zayo Holdings (ZAYO) as a takeover candidate, because small cell systems require fiber-optic links in metro areas for long-haul transport.Next-generation data centers — to keep all these things humming on the internet — will be another battleground, as Cisco takes on Arista Networks (ANET), startup Affirmed Networks and others.Meanwhile, startup SigFox, the LoRa alliance — with members including Cisco and IBM (IBM) — and others aim to provide all IoT devices with low-power connections via Wi-Fi and unlicensed spectrum.5G backers aim to create flexible networks that provide both the high-bandwidth connections required by fast-moving, self-driving cars in urban areas and always-on, reliable, low-data-rate connections needed by parking meters, oil rig sensors or other devices.While 4G networks provide cars with infotainment, 5G services are expected to provide real-time environmental data so, for example, driverless cars can avoid collisions.To service various types of devices, wireless networks will need to utilize both very high radio frequencies not yet commercialized and lower-band airwaves. Improved radio antennas and more complex semiconductors are expected to make higher frequencies usable for 5G.In urban areas, hundreds of ""small cell"" antennas hung on utility poles or buildings will work together, analysts say.Wireless networks and telecom data centers will be upgraded to provide both high and low data rate services, again to service various types of sensors and devices. AT&T and Verizon are among the leaders in moving to software-defined-network technology. SDN will help usher in 5G. With it, wireless firms can improve network bandwidth allocation and provide cloud-based, on-demand services.Part of the 5G revolution involves connecting a network of data centers to the IoT. That's a focus for Intel, Cisco, China's Huawei and many other companies.""5G will be a whole transformation of the network to virtualization, providing more flexibility and agility,"" said Jean Luc Valente, vice president of product management for Cisco's cloud and virtualization group. ""With 5G, with connected cars, some data is going to be collected, maybe at a traffic light intersection. Those data nuggets will be (analyzed), maybe not in the back-end data center, maybe much closer in a micro-cloud."" The upshot, among many benefits, is that self-driving cars won't collide.Cisco aims to provide cloud-based IoT services as it shifts away from hardware sales. The company partnered in February with Intel and Sweden's Ericsson (ERIC) to start selling a swath of 5G hardware and services. They are involved in 5G trials by Verizon and others.As 5G sparks partnerships, it's also generating M&As with 5G or IoT angles.Qualcomm expects its pending acquisition of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) to pay dividends in autonomous cars. Japan-based SoftBank acquired wireless chip designer ARM Holdings for $31 billion with an eye toward I0T.AT&T says it will move to 5G faster if regulators approve its acquisition of media giant Time Warner (TWX), part of its strategy to whisk more video to mobile devices.Cisco bought Jasper in March for $1.4 billion, gaining a cloud-based IoT platform. Verizon in February announced an agreement to acquire XO Communications, which owns high-frequency spectrum for 5G services, for $1.8 billion.Internet leaders, too, are jockeying for leading roles in 5G. Facebook (FB) is working with equipment vendors and carriers on standards. Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) is developing open software for the IoT.For Intel, 5G and IoT offer an opportunity to turn its money-losing mobile business around, says Citigroup. For Qualcomm, the shift to 5G should provide higher profit margins as the 4G generation matures.South Korea's KT and Verizon are forging ahead in prestandard deployment of 5G, aiming to drive technical specifications for 5G radio gear. KT plans to showcase 5G technology at the 2018 Winter Olympics, though just how isn't known.Aside from the Internet of Things and 5G mobility, Verizon is eyeing fixed 5G wireless broadband services to homes, potentially taking on cable TV companies. It's not clear yet if 5G fixed broadband could provide high-speed internet in neighborhoods or blanket bigger areas, analysts say. The Verizon trials will help determine that.Verizon has been investing across the board — in SDN, small cell technology and fixed wireless, says Adam Koeppe, vice president of technology planning at Verizon.""We're putting in the building blocks for what comes next. IoT is one of them,"" he said. ""The goal of the IoT device evolution is to have very low-cost modules, with long battery life. Think of sensors, smart meters — things that get embedded in day-to-day infrastructure and products that communicate on low bandwidth, on a sliver of spectrum, gobbling up very little of network resources.""""Where 5G fits into the equation is scale,"" Koeppe added. ""IoT will be about tens of billions of devices connected to the network. When you think of truly connected societies — traffic lights, stop signs, parking meters and everything within a city connected and interacting with itself — that's where 5G comes into play.""Yet 5G-related revenue is still on the distant horizon for most companies, analysts say. The marketing hype has picked up long before 5G networks and services will be deployed.IoT revenue is about 1% of global mobile revenue now and will grow at about 20% annually over the next five years, says market research firm Analysys Mason. Revenue is small in part because monthly revenue from IoT devices might come to just $1 or $2, not the $60 or more from smartphone users.RELATED:Qualcomm Upgraded On NXP Acquisition, Adds 'Tons Of Scale'Verizon Among Those With Lots At Stake With Next FCC ChairmanCisco Rival Arista Soars On Import Green Light

372,QCOM,"Stocks opened modestly higher Wednesday. A surprise surge in producer prices and a slowdown in retail sales had little impact on trading, as investors focused on the Federal Reserve's policy announcement this afternoon.The Nasdaq climbed 0.1% while the Dow industrials and S&P 500 were up a fraction.Markets generally expect a quarter-point hike in the Fed's target interest rate to 0.50%-0.75%. The move follows a quarter-point increase a year-ago — the Fed's first increase since June 2006. The more intense scrutiny is likely to be on any sense of whether the regulators plan additional rate hikes in the coming year, and at what pace. The policy announcement is scheduled for 2 p.m. ET, followed by a press conference with Chairwoman Janet Yellen at 2:30 p.m. ET.Nvidia (NVDA) opened 1% higher, rising after Evercore ISIS Group upgraded the stock to buy, from hold, and gave it a price target of 120. Nvidia ended Tuesday at 91.17. The stock has been consolidating for four weeks, following a powerful rebound from support at its 10-week moving average.Nordson (NDSN) snapped 6% higher at the open. The maker of industrial adhesive and coating systems' fiscal fourth-quarter sales and earnings blew past analyst expectations, and management raised its first-quarter guidance to above consensus views. The stock, which has a daily dollar volume of $24 million, ended Tuesday in a buy range above a 102.30 buy point from a flat base.General Motors (GM) dived 2.5% in early action. News reports said General Motors' joint venture in China was under investigation by China's National Development and Reform Commission for possible antitrust violations. GM shares ended Tuesday near new highs, after exiting a 13-month consolidation.Qualcomm (QCOM) slipped 0.5% after JPMorgan Chase trimmed the stock to neutral from overweight. Qualcomm is forming a flat base with a 71.72 buy point.The growth of retail sales slowed to 0.1% in November, the Commerce Department said, down from October's 0.6% gain and well below expectations for a 0.4% advance. Minus autos and gas, sales rose 0.2%, also down from 0.6% in October and below projections for a 0.3% increase.The Labor Department reported prices paid to producers jumped 0.4% in November. That was a big step above October's flat performance, as well as the 0.2% gain expected by analyst consensus. Prices were also up 0.4% minus food and energy, vs. a 0.2% slip last month, and topping views for a 0.2% increase.The Federal Reserve reports November industrial production and capacity data at 9:15 a.m. ET.At 10 a.m. ET the market gets October business inventories data from the Commerce Department, followed by weekly crude oil supply numbers from the Energy Information Administration at 10:30 a.m. ET.Oil futures backed off after a four-day advance and ahead of the this morning's weekly inventories report from the EIA. West Texas Intermediate dipped 1% to near $52 a barrel.

373,QCOM,"Chip stocks took it on the chin Thursday as widespread tech-stock selling pulled down top semiconductor companies.Some chipmakers, including Broadcom (AVGO), Cirrus Logic (CRUS) and Qualcomm (QCOM), likely were hurt by a report of Apple (AAPL) cutting production orders for its iPhone 7.Other chip stocks fell as institutional investors rotated out of tech stocks into other sectors, such as bank and oil stocks.Broadcom stock closed down 4.5% at 162.79 on the stock market today. Cirrus Logic sank 10.3% to 49.32, and Qualcomm fell 5.8% 64.16.Other major semiconductor firms hurt by the sell-off included Nvidia (NVDA), down 5%, Qorvo (QRVO), down 6.3%, Microchip Technology (MCHP), down 7.5%, and Intel (INTC), down 2.7%.IBD'S TAKE: The IBD 50 list of top growth stocks includes seven chip companies, including Nvidia and Microchip. The IBD 50 is one of many proprietary stock analysis tools for investors to consult on Investors.com.IBD's two chip industry groups, chip manufacturers and fabless chipmakes, lost 4.9% and 4.8%, respectively, and were the second- and third-to-worse performers among IBD's 197 industry groups, behind on the Food-Diary Products group.One chip stock that defied the trend was Semtech (SMTC), which gained 3.6% Thursday.Semtech, a designer of analog and mixed-signal semiconductors, late Wednesday reported better-than-expected third-quarter sales and earnings and guided higher for Q4.RELATED:Micron Stock Gets Price-Target Hikes On Raised Q1 GuidanceBroadcom Stock Nears Buy Point On Bullish ReportMacom Technology Solutions Gets Price-Target Hike On Acquisition News

374,QCOM,"The Nasdaq tumbled 1.4% Thursday afternoon as semiconductors and other technology stocks were pounded.Volume was tracking higher across the board. Losers led winners by 3-to-2 on the Nasdaq and NYSE.The chip equipment, chip design and chip manufacturing industry groups were down 3% to 3.5%, foundering in today's industry performance table. Software, fiber optic and other technology groups were in the bottom depths, too.Among sell-offs in chips, Microchip (MCHP) skidded 6% to its 50-day moving average. Nvidia (NVDA) slid 5%. Cirrus Logic (CRUS) sank 9%. A breakout attempt Nov. 21 fizzled and the stock has undercut its base.Intel (INTC) shed nearly 2% and continues working on a base. Qualcomm (QCOM) broke below its 50-day moving average in busy trading. But Semtech (SMTC) roared 9% to a three-year high after the chipmaker beat profit expectations.Other major Nasdaq components were lower too, including Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL). The stock fell 1.5% as it tested support at the 50-day line.The S&P 500 was off 0.4%. But the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 0.2%, thanks to strength in oil companies Chevron (CVX) and Exxon Mobil (XOM), and most financials. All three indexes were at session lows.Energy stocks continued higher, shadowing increases in the price of crude that followed OPEC's production-cut agreement Wednesday. Oil was up 4.6% to $51.72 a barrel, the highest price since Oct. 20.The weakness in chips spread to the IBD 50, which was down about 0.2%. But its financial companies gave the index some buoyancy. Of 26 IBD 50 stocks that were higher in today's trading, 17 were banks, insurers or savings and loans.In the auto sector, Tenneco (TEN) climbed back above the 59.98 buy point of a cup without handle.RELATED:GM, Ford Shares Jump As Trucks, SUVs Lead November Sales McDonald's, Wendy's Downgraded; Deere, Semtech Upgraded

375,QCOM,"A week ago, semiconductor ETFs were selling off and looking dangerous. But now, they've bounced back impressively.The sector was roiled Dec. 1, with many chip stocks suffering their worst drops in months. The exact cause was unclear. Worries over soft iPhone demand contributed to the selling.The sell-off caused the three chip ETFs in IBD's ETF Leaders screen to fall to their 50-day moving averages, but at that key level shares found support and have been rising. That's a bullish recovery. However, the quick rebounds have left the ETFs largely extended from proper buy areas. Investors must wait for a new pullback or another type of follow-on entry to find another chance to invest.In all three cases, the funds broke out of bases in mid-November and made only modest progress before they got pulled down by the undertow of the Dec. 1 sell-off.SPDR S&P Semiconductor (XSD) made a record high this week. It had broke out past a 53.88 buy point Nov. 17. The fund is primarily a smaller-capitalization vehicle in the chip space, with about 40 stocks averaging about $7 billion in market cap.Its three largest holdings — Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Nvidia (NVDA) and Microsemi (MSCC) — have produced stupendous returns since November and reached new highs this week. In fact, their advances may be getting overheated.IShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (SOXX) also is at all-time highs, tracing a chart quite similar to SPDR S&P Semiconductor. The fund tracks the Philadelphia semiconductor index, a well-known sector gauge that often goes by the nickname ""Sox.""It is a more-focused portfolio, with 30 components that form a blend of mid- and large-cap stocks. The fund also has been well-served by owning Nvidia — the largest holding, at 10.6% weighting. But other major holdings, such as Intel (INTC), Texas Instruments (TXN) and Qualcomm (QCOM), have had much more sedate price performance the past few months.VanEck Vectors Semiconductor (SMH) started trading in May 2000, when the tech bubble was bursting. It has yet to reach the record levels that it achieved back then. But today it's acting as well as the other chip ETFs. At 4% above the 50-day moving average, it  is not yet extended.The fund owns about 25 companies in semiconductor production and equipment, with Intel and Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) the biggest components, at 14% weighting each.The IBD ETF Leaders index shows the performance of a model portfolio of exchange traded funds that are leading the overall market. A computer algorithm selects the ETFs based on relative strength and other objective performance ratings, with periodic adjustments for market trends and conditions.

377,QCOM,"The harsh sell-off of semiconductor stocks on Thursday created a buying opportunity for investors wanting a stake in top chip companies, Mizuho Securities analyst Vijay Rakesh said in a report.Semiconductor stocks fell hard Thursday as investors rotated out of the tech sector and also reacted to reports that Apple (AAPL) is cutting production of its iPhone 7 handsets, Rakesh said.""The substantial pullback despite much stronger fundamentals, in our view, creates a buying opportunity,"" he said in a report. ""Semiconductor valuations are back to Feb.-April of 2016.""Rakesh recommended buying Broadcom (AVGO), Cypress Semiconductor (CY), Intel (INTC), Micron Technology (MU), Microsemi (MSCC), ON Semiconductor (ON), Qualcomm (QCOM) and Western Digital (WDC).""All have, in our view, significant growth and strong fundamentals ahead,"" he said.IBD'S TAKE: The IBD 50 list of top growth stocks includes six chip companies, such as Microsemi and Nvidia. The IBD 50 is one of many proprietary stock analysis tools for investors to consult on Investors.com.Semiconductor stocks are attractive ""given the strong earnings growth, cost synergies, strong industrial, automotive, defense/aerospace, and continued synergistic M&A driven also by a better regulatory environment,"" Rakesh said.Rakesh's eight stock picks all dropped Thursday, but they all gained some ground on the stock market today.In his report, Rakesh also listed graphics chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) as a buy, but said its steep valuation could give investors pause. Nvidia also edged higher Friday.Meanwhile, Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill reiterated his buy rating on audio chipmaker Cirrus Logic (CRUS) with a price target of 65. He said Cirrus was pushed down on ""noise"" about iPhone 7 sales.""We remain bullish on CRUS as we see several vectors of growth, including further penetration of digital and ultimately ANC (active noise cancellation) headsets (beginning in Q1 2017) in the Android and accessory markets, a better iPhone 8 unit cycle, and expansion in the audio amplifier market,"" Gill said.Cirrus Logic rose 1.6% to 50.10 on Friday, but fell nearly 13% for the week.RELATED:Demand 'Sedate' For Apple iPhone 7, 'Robust' For iPhone 7 PlusGoPro Chip Supplier Ambarella Down On Weak Q4 Guidance

Netflix's stock is near its record high, but concerns over costs and plans for 1,000 hours of original content are prompting a new question: Should investors still view the company as a tech disrupter shaking up Big Media, or has its seduction by Hollywood left it unable to still act like a nimble tech startup?Netflix initially rose higher but reversed to close down 5.5% at 115.42 in the stock market today as investors dumped many big-cap techs.RELATED:Apple, FANG Stocks Aren't Joining Trump RallyThe Pentagon contractor was upgraded to a buy from hold with a price target of 275 by Deutsche Bank.

379,QCOM,"One day ahead of another historic U.S. presidential election, the relief rally by the stocks in the wake of an ended FBI investigation over Hillary Clinton's emails finished strong Monday. Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) lagged the major indexes, yet the heavily influential stock is now making a second attempt to make a significant move past a 110.33 cup-with-handle buy point.Apple closed the day up 1.4% to 110.44. After its Sept. 14 initial breakout, shares in the largest company on the U.S. exchanges by market cap rallied as much as 7.6% before backtracking along with the general market.Turnover in Apple finished 15% below average, a slight disappointment, but it appeared to rise from Friday's quiet session.On the dawn of a pivotal U.S. presidential election, the Nasdaq composite led the way, closing ahead nearly 2.4% and wiping away last week's 2% loss. The S&P 500 wasn't far behind, rising 2.2%.A wide range of industry groups tracked by IBD raced 3% higher or more, including jewelry retail, data storage, managed health insurers, hospitals, biotech, travel booking, security software and trucking. Gold and silver miners were the only stocks seeing deep losses. Volume was running moderately lower on both main exchanges vs. the same time Friday, according to preliminary data.Small caps also roared higher, with the Russell 2000 rebounding 2.5% and the S&P SmallCap 600 rising 2.4%.The Dow Jones industrials rallied 2.1%, their biggest gain since late January. Financials helped the cause, particularly Wall Street banks including JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS).  The former roared 3.1% higher to 69.88, and now has rallied 7% past a 65.08 cup with handle entry, and is thus extended in price. Don't chase stocks more than 5% past the proper buy point.Goldman jumped more than 3% to 181.48 and is now slightly extended: 5.2% past a 172.52 entry in a bottoming base pattern.Breakouts were relatively scarce Monday, but Gigamon (GIMO) surged 7% to 57.88, clearing a 56.48 buy point in heavy volume and clearing a flat-base-like consolidation.The drop within the new base was 14%, meeting the 15% limit for flat-base patterns. The data security play also rebounded nicely back above the 50-day line on Oct. 28, triggering a new buy point near 50. Gigamon is now extended from that entry.Returning to Apple, the consumer tech play is trying to reclaim its key 50-day moving average after sliding below it last week. However, other technical gauges point to generally improved strength in the megacap tech. The RS Rating of 70, as seen in IBD Stock Checkup, is a huge lift from 26 eight weeks ago. The 70 rating means Apple is now outperforming 70% of all companies in IBD's database over the past 12 months.IBD Stock Checkup also shows the up/down volume ratio rising to a neutral 1.0. A ratio of more than 1.0 means that a stock has seen more volume on up days in price vs. down days over the past 50 trading sessions. Apple's Accumulation/Distribution Rating of B- implies rising share accumulation by mutual funds, hedge funds, pensions and the like.Wall Street still expects Apple to post its smallest decline in earnings in its December-ending fiscal first quarter, down less than 2% to $3.22 a share. The highest estimate among 36 analysts is $3.77, up 15%. Revenue is seen edging up 2% to $77.1 billion, which would end a three-quarter drought of falling sales.While research firm KGI Securities said iPhone shipments are likely to drop in the first half of 2017, primarily due to weak demand in China,  suppliers of key components for Apple iPhones brushed off such news and rallied.Broadcom (AVGO), an IBD Leaderboard name, gained 2.8% to 176.96, climbing past a 176 aggressive entry within a flat base. The stock's RS line continues to rise, meaning it's outpacing the performance of the S&P 500. The RS line is painted in blue in IBD charts.Qualcomm (QCOM) gapped up 2.6% to 68.46, keeping above its 50-day line; its solid uptrend is intact. The stock initially broke out of a bottoming cup pattern at 56.37 in July.RELATED:What Is The Bottoming Base Pattern?When Did Apple Break Out?Will The Stock Market Rise More If Hillary Wins, Or Donald Wins?

380,QCOM,"Stocks forfeited modest gains during an afternoon sell-off Friday, leaving the indexes mildly in the red by day's end. Small caps, however, bucked the decline.Volume edged slightly lower on both exchanges, according to preliminary data, ahead of Tuesday's pivotal presidential election. As the latest Investor's Corner column notes, in recent decades the average gain during Democratic presidencies has outweighed Republican ones.The Nasdaq composite let an intraday gain of nearly 0.5% slide back into a 0.2% loss; while negative reversals are not constructive for the bulls, the overall intraday range was not that wide.Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) squandered early gains to finish 0.9% lower at 108.84, less than 2 points below its 110.33 proper entry point in a cup-with-handle pattern.It's now spent four sessions on the south side of its 50-day moving average. That's not a lot of time, but you'd like to see a leading stock trading above the 50-day line when it's trying to break out.The S&P 500 lost slightly less than 0.2% and the Dow Jones industrials fell slightly more than 0.2%. But the Russell 2000 gained nearly 0.6%, cutting its weekly loss to 2%.For the week, the Nasdaq fell 2.8%, its second worst weekly drop in 2016. The tech-rich composite slumped 5.4% in the week ended Feb. 5.The S&P 500 lost 1.9% for the week, sinking in four of the past five weeks. The large-cap benchmark is now challenging support at its 40-week moving average (please see a weekly chart; the 40-week line roughly mimics the 200-day line on a daily chart).The general market on Friday encountered seesaw trading all day, following a smaller-than-expected increase in October U.S. payrolls. But the Labor Department also sharply revised higher job gains in the prior two months by an additional 44,000 jobs. Plus, economists heralded the 10-cent hike in average wages, noting that gives the Federal Reserve more reason to raise interest rates during its final meeting of the year (Dec. 13-14).Other big-cap techs also fell for the week, including Qualcomm (QCOM) (down 2.4%), Activision Blizzard (ATVI) (down 3.7%) and Intel (INTC) (down 3.1%).Qualcomm held steady at its 10-week moving average. The wireless chip technology giant plans to buy NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) to broaden its product library. Activision reported solid Q3 results (EPS up 152%, sales up 58%) but still fell below its 10-week line. Intel is trying to stop a slide through its longer-term 40-week moving average.Tesla Motors (TSLA) rose more 1.7% to 190.56, ending a vicious five-day slide. Yet since losing buying support at the 50-day moving average in late August, the electric vehicle leader has failed twice in rising back above the key intermediate trend line.As noted in past Stock Market Today columns, the former big winner of 2013 likely needs a lot more time before investors pile back into the stock and drive it to a level where it could potentially break out.Funds sponsorship in Tesla is checkered, as the number of mutual and hedge funds owning shares has declined from 1,048 at the end of 2015 to 1,017 at the end of the third quarter this year, but total shares owned have increased from 52.8 million to 55.7 million.Elsewhere in the market, Monster Beverage (MNST) dropped as much as 10% early before cutting its loss to less than 4% and ending at 135.23. Volume surged by seven times its 50-day average after the energy drink marketer reported disappointing Q3 adjusted earnings of 99 cents a share, up 18% but nearly 12% below Wall Street's consensus view.Monster's third-quarter sales rose 4% to $788 million, the smallest increase in five quarters. The stock's IBD Composite Rating on Stock Checkup has fallen to a middling 75 out of a maximum 99.RELATED:What Is The Bottoming Base Chart Pattern, And How Do Investors Profit From It?When Did Apple Break Out This Year?How Will The Stock Market Do After The Nov. 8 Presidential Election?Where Can I Learn All Of IBD's Key Sell Rules For Stocks?

390,QCOM,"Growth-stock funds have outperformed their blend and value counterparts in the past 10 years. But the reverse is true for this year, with the average value fund up nearly 8%, the average blend fund up nearly 6% and the average growth fund up 3%.Among the growth funds that have kept pace with value funds this year is Parnassus Endeavor Fund (PARWX). The large-cap growth fund is up 12% this year. Its recent top holdings include Applied Materials (AMAT), up 56% this year, Qualcomm (QCOM) up 43% and Micron Technology (MU) up 24%.Holdings that haven't done as well include Gilead Sciences (GILD), down 24% this year, and generic-drug maker Perrigo (PRGO) down 37%.The $1.9 billion fund has been managed by Jerome Dodson since 2005.The fund seeks to buy high-quality companies that it can hold long-term. It seeks to keep about 30 companies in its portfolio, giving significant weightings to most. It has a turnover rate of 63%.Parnassus Endeavor has an environmental, social and governance (ESG) component, as holdings must offer outstanding workplaces and not be involved with oil and other fossil fuels.In his fund commentary for Q3, written in early October, Dodson said the market looked fairly valued. A decline in the number of attractive stocks helps explain why cash in the fund had built up to over 15%, way above average for stock funds. It's also way above his goal for 5% cash.""Although I would like to put some of the cash to work, I won't invest just for the sake of reducing our cash position,"" he said. ""There has to be a good idea to inspire an investment, and that means a good company trading at a very attractive price. This strategy has served us well over the years, as evidenced by our strong returns, so I'm not tempted to change our policy and lower the fund's standards just to reduce our cash balance.""Strong inflow to the fund from investors attracted by its strong performance has contributed to the cash build. Dodson encourages investors stay the course. ""Keep those investments coming in! At some point, I'll figure out what to do with the money,"" he said.Dodson professed a lack of deep concern for the likely path for interest rates.""While the immediate reaction to an interest-rate increase will probably be a drop in the stock market, longer‐term, a gradual and reasonable increase in rates will probably not depress the market for very long,"" he said in his commentary.""Rising interest rates usually mean the economy is doing better, so corporations are doing better and stocks find a way to move higher,"" he continued. ""If interest rates move higher late this year or early next year, the initial reaction may be a stock market swoon. If this happens, and stocks go down to more attractive valuations, it may provide us with an opportunity to put some of that idle cash to work.""RELATED:Parnassus' Dodson Wins With Hot Tech Stocks That Pass ESG ScreensThis Is What Fidelity Trend Likes About Apple, Amazon And AlphabetWhy A Top Columbia Fund Likes These Stock LeadersChinese, Other Foreign Stocks Drove Top Q3 Mutual Fund Performance

392,QCOM,"Stocks resumed their stiff selling in the first hour of trading Thursday following a sharper drop in weekly jobless claims than expected. The further evidence of a strengthening economy likely boosts the chance of a nominal hike in interest rates in December, and investors are deciding to take a more defensive stance this week. Wall Street was also spooked by weak export data out of China.The Nasdaq composite fell 1.3%, hurt by sharp drops in big-cap techs, before rebounding a bit. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrials were both down around 0.8% to 0.9%. Small caps also saw fierce selling. The S&P SmallCap 600 and the Russell 2000 both sank, dropping more than 1.3% initially before shaving their losses a tad.The Dow utility average rallied more than 0.5%.

On July 22, the stock broke out of a bottoming base and leapt past a 56.37 buy point in a super-long saucer with handle structure in big volume. The strong move also enabled Qualcomm to shatter a long-term downtrend. The catalyst: a 17% jump in earnings per share, breaking a four-quarter streak of falling profit, on a 4% lift in revenue.In mid-September, shares then made a successful rebound off the 50-day moving average near 60, providing a second opportunity to scoop up shares.Apple (AAPL) is posting its first decline after a seven-session run that has taken shares up as much as 7.6% above a new 110.33 cup-with-handle buy point. Shares eased 1% to 116.11, still extended past that proper entry.On the upside, Ulta Beauty (ULTA) gapped up at the open and rose more than 6% to 254.90 in fast turnover following bullish earnings guidance.

Shares had fallen 5.2% Thursday to below its 50-day line.Lumentum (LITE) said Q1 EPS rose 69% to 44 cents and revenue climbed 19% to $252.3 million, topping expectations but current quarter revenue guidance was light amid a telecom component shortage from an unnamed supplier. EPS guidance of 51 cents at the midpoint was above consensus estimates of 49 cents.

The company topped the Street's estimate on Q3 earnings by nearly 7%. Revenue came in more than 4% above expectations. The maker of therapies for cancer and inflammatory diseases also raised guidance.Celgene's chart has work to do. The stock is about 19% off its 52-week high. The stock's most recent breakout came in July when Celgene cleared a base within a larger consolidation. However, the double-bottom pattern with a 108.60 entry lacked a prior uptrend of 30%, and the breakout failed.Qualcomm (QCOM) gapped up 3% on news that the mega-cap company would acquire NXP Semiconductors (NXPI). Because of regulatory reviews, the deal isn't expected to close until late 2017. NXP rose 1%. Thursday's news had been rumored since late September and both stocks made big moves Sept. 29.Pipeline play Antero Midstream Partners (AM) gapped up 5%, hitting a 52-week high. The stock is somewhat thinly traded, but has delivered triple-digit earnings gains in three of the past four quarters. Antero reported quarterly results Wednesday, beating the Street's estimates on the top and bottom line.In economic news, first-time jobless claims were a bit more than expected. Durable goods orders for September missed the consensus target, but the prior reading was revised upward. Pending home sales in September topped the Street's estimate.

398,QCOM,"It was anything but a dull week on the stock market. On the IBD 50 list, three stocks scored breakouts. At least five broke down and flashed sell signals. But the group's overall status remained solid, with about 20% of the IBD 50 at or near new highs and another 20% still in valid bases. That means there is good…

400,QCOM,"Scanning IBD DataTables for income ideas was a lot easier earlier this year.Even the IBD 50, the premier list of strength in the stock market, was littered with stocks sporting healthy dividends, especially from the utilities and real estate investment trusts (REITs).Contrast that to today, when a screen of utilities leaders only yielded a couple names as of Wednesday's close, both of them breaking support levels. A screen of REIT leaders offers a dozen names but only one is above its 50-day moving average and none has a Relative Price Strength Rating above 80.The Dividend Leaders screen, however, does have a few ideas of interest. Particularly, noteworthy are a couple chip stocks, Qualcomm (QCOM) and Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM).Qualcomm is still a dominant force in the mobile-phone market with its chip designs in mobile products of Apple (AAPL), Samsung, and now Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google Pixel. While, no one is expecting Qualcomm to ""party like its 1999"" when it ran up over 2,000%, it still offers an attractive dividend with the potential for capital appreciation.Granted, Qualcomm doesn't have the triple-digit earnings growth it had in its youth. In fact, prior to its 17% growth for its fiscal Q3 in 2016, the company saw four consecutive quarters of profit declines. Qualcomm is scheduled to report its fourth quarter, ended in September, on Nov. 2 after the close.March 2016 saw a completion of a one-year commitment to repurchase $10 billion in stock and the quarterly dividend was raised to 53 cents earlier this year. That was the 15th dividend increase since 2003, putting the annualized yield at 3.2%.The most recent news on Qualcomm is the rumors of a potential acquisition of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI). NXP makes high-performance mixed signal processors for communications, security, automotive and industrial applications. An acquisition of NXP offers more diversity for Qualcomm beyond the heavy reliance on mobile. Particularly interesting is the exposure to the auto-related chips, a fast-growing field.Meanwhile, Maxim is noteworthy for the current base its carving out. The stock is working on a base-on-base structure with its current flat base showing support right on top of the cup with handle formed earlier. The stock is currently trying to get back above its 50-day moving average, closing right at the line on Thursday.Maxim is a chipmaker specializing in integrated circuits for autos, cloud data centers, industrial and mobile applications. It has an annualized dividend yield of 3.3%. The company is reporting Q1 fiscal 2017 earnings on Oct. 20.Earlier this year, Maxim was also in the takeover buzz as a possible acquisition by Texas Instruments (TXN).The chart might seem like a real bore since there have actually been multiple bases formed at this point that haven't seemed able to launch. However, that action is not without precedent.Before Qualcomm's huge run in 1999, it also had multiple bases that didn't go anywhere, until it formed a near-perfect cup with handle that launched the stock for good. Of course, that was a different time with not only Qualcomm's earnings growth acting as a catalyst but also a strong market providing a powerful tailwind.RELATED:NXP Hires Advisor To Field Offers As Qualcomm CirclesQualcomm Gets More Upbeat Reviews on NXP Semi Merger RumorWhere Are Chipmakers In The Cycle

401,QCOM,"Samsung's decision to cancel production and sales of its problem-plagued Galaxy Note 7 smartphone is likely to have a ""modest negative impact"" on several mobile-chip suppliers, Pacific Crest Research said Tuesday.Semiconductor manufacturers with the most exposure to Samsung business include Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM), Synaptics (SYNA), Qualcomm (QCOM) and Qorvo (QRVO).Maxim has the highest exposure to Samsung, with the South Korean tech giant accounting for 4.2% of Maxim's revenue, Pacific Crest said in a research report. Synaptics is second with 2.9% of revenue from Samsung, followed by Qualcomm (2.7%) and Qorvo (2.3%), the investment bank said.IBD'S TAKE: The semiconductor industry has been the source of some top-performing stocks lately. Eight chip-sector stocks are now on the IBD 50 list of top-performing companies.Conversely, Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 black-eye could drive more business to Apple's (AAPL) iPhone family, Pacific Crest said.Canaccord Genuity analyst Michael Walkley said the Galaxy Note 7 recall will have a ""slight impact to near-term estimates"" for Qualcomm.Qualcomm stock, which touched a four-month high above 70 on Sept. 30, slipped 3 cents in the stock market today to close at 66.06. Synaptics stock rose a fraction Wednesday, while Maxim and Qorvo each fell a fraction.In his research report on Qualcomm, Walkley said, ""We are slightly lowering our MSM (mobile station modem) shipment estimates for the December and March quarters following the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 discontinuation of production, as Qualcomm supplies the higher ASP (average selling price) Snapdragon 820 (processor) for this smartphone.""Walkley reiterated his buy rating on Qualcomm stock and raised his price target to 75 from 70. He is bullish on Qualcomm's opportunities with Chinese handset makers, such as Vivo and Oppo. Walkley also is positive on Qualcomm's rumored interest in acquiring of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI).RELATED:Qualcomm Close To Giving Final Rose To NXP SemiconductorsApple Stock Rises On Price-Target Hike, Improved Sentiment

402,QCOM,"Major stock ETFs closed higher for the week, with investors cheering two key tech earnings and news of a semiconductor deal Friday.SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) posted a 0.4% weekly gain, led higher by the materials sector while utilities trailed. This exchange traded fund serves as a proxy for the broad U.S. market and sits 2% below its August high of 219.60.Shares of two out of roughly 500 holdings struck record highs on the stock market today.Microsoft (MSFT) jumped 4.3%, climbing as high as 60.45 after the company reported solid results from its cloud unit as it pivots away from a hardware-focused business model.PayPal (PYPL) gapped up 10.0%, rising as much as 44.24 after reporting it grew active customer accounts and revenue.Among other holdings, chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM) rose 0.9% amid news that the company is nearing a deal for NXP Semiconductors (NXPI).IBD'S TAKE: Microsoft stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 65, meaning it has outperformed 65% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months. For a list of better-performing stocks, check out the IBD 50.SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) advanced 1.2% on the week after three weeks of losses amid a rising dollar and rate-hike fears. The commodity ETF tracks the spot price of gold.Gold's gains propelled silver and gold mining stocks to some of the best weekly gains across the nonleveraged ETF landscape.VanEck Vectors Gold Miners (GDX) gained 7.1% on the week to retake the 40-week moving average.

404,QCOM,"With chipmakers the No. 2 sector in IBD's tables, three semiconductor ETFs have earned spots in the ETF Leaders screen.All three ETFs are tracing similar chart patterns: After strong gains from July breakouts, they are pausing at the 50-day moving average. A rise from the line would provide ETF traders with a chance to buy shares. While tactically there's a buy opportunity, keep in mind that these ETFs have already made a big jump -- up 18% to 28% this year. Thus, investors have a difficult decision on whether to use one of these ETFs to gain exposure to the hot sector.VanEck Vector Semiconductor (SMH) and iShares PHLX Semiconductor (SOXX) bulk up on the industry titans. Qualcomm (QCOM), Intel (INTC), Broadcom (AVGO), Texas Instruments (TXN) and Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) are among the largest holdings of both funds.Those stocks have made moderate to solid gains this year, and are no doubt largely responsible for the ETFs' advance. But Nvidia (NVDA), another top holding of the funds, has had a superlative 2016, more than doubling since a breakout in mid-March. Best known for graphics chips, Nvidia is now a big player is the technology to design self-driving cars.The iShares Semiconductor ETF mimics the Philadelphia semiconductor index, or SOX as it's best known. It has 30 companies, which include the industry heavyweights.SPDR S&P Semiconductor (XSD) ETF has a markedly different composition than the other two. That may explain why the ETF has lagged the other two. It's up 18% year to date (through Thursday's close), while VanEck Semiconductors has climbed nearly 28% and iShares Semiconductors 23%.The major components of SPDR S&P Semiconductor aren't all big-capitalization stocks, but also include small-caps and midcaps such as Synaptics (SYNA) (market cap of $2.4 billion), Cirrus Logic (CRUS) ($3.4 billion) and solar-power module maker First Solar (FSLR) ($4.3 billion).SPDR S&P Semiconductor tracks an index of chip companies selected mainly for their revenue but also earnings, market capitalization and ""market perception,"" as the prospectus says.IBD's chip sector is up about 17% this year, thanks in part to higher-than-expected demand for the new Apple iPhone 7, increasing use of electronics in the home (the Internet of Things) and chips in cars. Even with the flop of the Samsung Note 7, the chip sector has been one of 2016's winners. Broadcom and Qualcomm are suppliers to iPhone and Samsung smartphones.The information technology sector continues to lead with the most positive earnings guidance. For Q3, that includes eight of 15 S&P 500 companies in semiconductor and chip equipment, according to a Sept. 28 report by FactSet.The IBD ETF Leaders index shows the performance of a model portfolio of exchange traded funds that are leading the overall market. A computer algorithm selects the ETFs based on relative strength and other objective performance ratings, with periodic adjustments for market trends and conditions.

405,QCOM,"Electric automaker Tesla Motors (TSLA) and ServiceNow (NOW) topped forecasts late Wednesday, while Texas Instruments (TXN) also beat but gave mixed guidance.

GAAP revenue is seen at $1.976 billion.Results: Adjusted EPS of 71 cents on revenue of $2.3 billion.Outlook: Q4 deliveries just over 25,000 and sees 2016 capital expenditures of $1.8 billion.Wall Street will likely be looking for any updates to the carmaker's production goals and its acquisition bid for SolarCity (SCTY).Tesla shares shot up 5% late after closing down less than 0.1% on the stock market today.

407,QCOM,"In an era when more than 80% of the active managers fail to beat their benchmark index, finding a mutual fund that consistently achieves the elusive element of alpha is akin to finding the Holy Grail.USAA Growth Fund (USAAX) is one of those funds. This portfolio of large-cap growth stocks has beaten its peers tracked by Morningstar Inc. year to date, as well as in the past one, three, five and 10 years. And it has beaten the S&P 500 stock index in the past one, three, five and 10 years. In 2015, it returned 5.63% vs. the S&P's 1.38%.Lately much of its outperformance has been driven by such stock market leaders as Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (FB) and Alibaba (BABA).The portfolio managers are Michael Schroer of Renaissance Investment Management and Aziz Hamzaogullari of Loomis Sayles. They each separately manage half the portfolio. Schroer has been with the fund since 1991 and Hamzaogullari since 2010.The fund's strategy is to look for high-quality companies that can generate sustainable and profitable growth. When the managers see stocks selling at a significant discount to their estimate of intrinsic value, they snap them up. This leads to a small portfolio of just 92 companies. The fund also has a very long-term investment horizon, seen in its 31% portfolio turnover rate.Still, even a fund that consistently outperforms has moments when it doesn't. So far this year, it's underperforming the S&P 500 5.90% to 6.61%.""We favor companies that are high quality growth selling at a reasonable valuation,"" said Schroer. ""In the first half of the year lower P/E growth didn't do well. Higher P/E companies led the market, but by the later part of the year that reversed and lower P/E companies are doing better and we've benefited from that. We're in the sweet spot for the market where lower P/E, higher quality are doing better.""Another part of the strategy, this one favored by the Loomis Sayles team, is described as high ""active share."" Active share is a way of measuring how much a portfolio differs from its benchmark index. ""Our active share has been at or above 80%,"" Hamzaogullari told IBD late last year. ""While it does not ensure outperformance, we believe it is a necessary condition for generating alpha and outperforming the benchmark, net of fees, over the long term.""U.S. stocks make up 90% of the fund, with the rest in foreign equities. Technology makes up 27% of the portfolio.Amazon as of July 31 stood as USAA Growth's largest holding, at about 4% of assets. The stock made up the entire retail-internet segment of the fund. Amazon is up 21% this year, sitting just above support at its 50-day moving average after pulling back 3% from its all time high set Oct. 6. Analysts expect Amazon to post Q3 earnings 371% higher than a year earlier when it reports results Thursday.Facebook is the No. 2 holding also at about 4% of assets. The social networking and media leader is up 24% year to date near the 28.43 buy point of a flat base. Fiscal Q1 earnings are expected to rise 70% from a year earlier when results are reported, expected Nov. 2 after the market's close.Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giants and another top fund holding, is up 28% so far this year. The stock has found support at its 50-day moving average, 6% below its 52-week high. The company is expect to show a fiscal Q2 earnings increase of 23% when it reports Tuesday.Not all USAA Growth top holdings have been barn burners. Database bellwether Oracle (ORCL) is up 5% this year. It's been in the fund since 2007.The rest of the top 10 holdings and their percentages are: Cisco Systems (CSCO), 3.24%; Visa (V), 3.11%; Qualcomm (QCOM), 2.89%; Monster Beverage (MNST), 2.52%; Alphabet (GOOGL), 2.48%; United Parcel Services (UPS), 2.37%.""We think technology and consumer discretionary look attractive,"" said Schroer. ""Health care still looks attractive. Biogen (BIIB) and Gilead Sciences (GILD) still look very cheap. In this market there are still high quality companies.""Schroer likes Foot Locker (FL). The athletic shoe retailer posted very good second-quarter sales and still trades at a ""very reasonable multiple of 14."" The stock is up only 4.4% this year.""Carnival (CCL) and Royal Caribbean (RCL) and both are doing well over the last several months,"" said Schroer. ""They had sold off on fears of the Zika virus hurting tourism, but they didn't suffer too much. Now bookings for next year are running high and multiples are very attractive, Royal's trailing P-E is 13 and Carnival's is 14.""We've taken some things off the table, but we still think there are selective opportunities in this market,"" he said. ""We've gone through six quarters of negative earnings growth and we're watching this quarter carefully for signs of a rebound.

409,QCOM,"The semiconductor sector continues to get top billing in IBD's 33 sector rankings. And why not?

Not only that, but the sector has been a hotbed of merger activity in recent months. Broadcom (AVGO) has been a mainstay in IBD's Sector Leaders…

410,QCOM,"Texas Instruments (TXN) could be a surprise candidate to step in and acquire NXP Semiconductor (NXPI), a move that would leave Qualcomm (QCOM) in the dust, says Nomura.""It almost seems inevitable that NXP will be acquired,"" wrote Nomura analyst Romit Shah in a research note Tuesday. Dow Jones last week was first to report that Qualcomm is looking to acquire NXP for about $30 billion.Like Qualcomm, Texas Instruments is one of the top 10 chip companies worldwide. TI specializes in analog chips and embedded processors. NXP makes high-performance mixed-signal processors for communications, security, automotive and industrial applications, and its shares quintupled 2012-2014 before slowing in the past 16 months.""Most investors expect Qualcomm to win the process,"" Shah wrote. ""While we don't disagree, we also see Texas Instruments as a dark horse that hasn't been seriously thought of and could rush past the field in triumph.""Shah says Texas Instruments is overdue to make a big acquisition, having made 33 over the past 20 years but none in the past five years.Buying NXP would boost Texas Instruments' microcontroller market share to No. 1 from No. 7. NXP is the leading supplier of non-automotive microcontroller units and second in industrial and automotive application processors, says Shah. Also, NXP would lift Texas Instruments from the fourth-largest to the second-largest non-memory semiconductor company by revenue, Shah wrote.Moreover, NXP CEO Rick Clemmer and Chairman Peter Bonfield are former TI employees, says Shah.""We believe that Clemmer maintains close ties with the TI management team, while Bonfield has spoken publicly about his affection for Texas Instruments,"" Shah wrote.NXP stock closed at 103.23, up a fraction, in the stock market today. Shares jumped 17% on Thursday, on reports of Qualcomm's interest, and have risen another seven percentage points since then. Texas Instruments slipped a fraction Tuesday, to 69.59.IBD'S TAKE: Big mergers often come with big challenges, and many never pan out. For an example of huge deal that so far is working out, look no further than the latest IBD 50 ranking of top-performing stocks over the past 52 weeks. Broadcom, a product of a merger completed early this year between Broadcom and Avago, resides at No. 36. More than that, Broadcom also is among IBD's Sector Leaders.Assuming NXP gets acquired, it would be part of a wave of consolidation occurring in the chip sector.RELATED:NXP Hires Adviser To Field Offers As Qualcomm CirclesTexas Instruments, Inphi, Yum Lead Wednesday Investing Action Plan

Unlocked versions of the Pixel phones will be sold at Google's online store.The Pixel smartphones are at the high end of the market, with prices starting at $649.""This is another shooting star that is bound to fizzle,"" said Anil Doradla, a William Blair analyst who covers Apple, said in a research report Wednesday. ""We do not believe this move will have material implications for Apple, and to a large extent we view this product introduction as a nonevent.""""Google's Pixel handset is another science project,"" he added.Kerry Rice, an analyst at Needham & Co., has a different take.""We believe Pixel is by far the strongest phone product introduced by Google, directly taking on Apple's iPhone 7 and Samsung's Galaxy S7,"" he said in a report. ""While the product is priced at a similar level as its competitors with comparable tech specs give or take, we believe Google's advantage could come from the phone's 'brain' -- Google's artificial intelligence capability, its expertise in search and maps, and its broad suite of applications including YouTube and Google Cloud.""Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) stock slipped a fraction on the stock market today. Alphabet stock rose a fraction Tuesday after being flat most of the day during the webcast announcements.IBD'S TAKE: Alphabet shares jumped 3.3% on July 29 after Q2 earnings and revenue beat, but the stock has been trading between 783.50 and 819.06 since then. Google stock has lagged Amazon.com and Facebook in 2016. Amazon and Facebook are IBD Leaderboard stocks.Google Home, the new voice-activated speaker/smart assistant, also features Google Assistant. Google Home as expected was priced at $129, $50 less than Amazon's Echo. Google Home offers natural language speech, unlike Echo, which consumers may like.Brian Fitzgerald, an analyst at Jefferies, is upbeat on Google Home.""Based on the success of Amazon's Echo, we believe the Google Home product can add $500 million in revenue in 2017,"" Fitzgerald said. ""Although they are a late mover, we are optimistic toward Google's position within this space due to their superior software, price-point, and cross-device capabilities. Google Assistant provides Google a leg up over competition due to its personalized features and their overall strength in AI and machine learning.""Amazon has not disclosed Echo sales figures. Consumer Intelligence Research Partners in April said Amazon had sold 3 million Echo devices since 2014. Some analysts have recently bumped total Echo sales to 4 million, but Amazon has been tight-lipped.Strategy Analytics on Wednesday said it expects sales of Echo and Google Home-type devices to reach 15.1 million units by 2020, up from 1.8 million in 2016.

412,QCOM,"Your mom might have told you to never judge people by their looks. But it's OK to do that with stocks.This is especially the case if you are an individual investor or a professional advisor and you wish to use charts to your full advantage.Do you have a sharp eye? Or do you want to improve your chart-reading skills? If you do, you'll be able to improve your returns in the stock market by avoiding stocks that form the V-shaped base.And if you harbor a big gain in a stock that carves out this faulty pattern, then you know the market has presented you the gift of insight from IBD's research that the stock is very close to peaking, and thus must be sold.Investors should be discriminating against bases that are V-shaped. Not only does a V-shaped cup pattern differ greatly from winning cup bases, but it also may bring about other sell signals.Just because a stock with strong fundamentals shapes a base doesn't mean that it's an automatic buy. You still have to pore over the stock's chart and decipher the good and the bad on its price-and-volume action.A V-shaped base may initially look like good action as the stock stages a fast recovery after selling off. But sometimes this type of action is akin to being too fast, too furious. This is not healthy.V-shaped bases don't allow a stock to go through a more natural correction. After a sharp pullback, it's good to see a stock consolidate for two or three weeks to wear out the remaining weak holders. This creates a better foundation and results in a U-shaped pattern.While a cup or cup-with-handle base can be as short as six or seven weeks, respectively, the bases of some of the biggest stock market winners have taken months or more to form. Qualcomm (QCOM) cleared a five-month cup with handle in January 1999 and staged an astronomical run.SunPower (SPWR) blasted out of a 10-month cup-with-handle pattern in 2006 and more than quadrupled before topping.Sometimes in a V-shaped base, a stock will fall hard for a couple of weeks and then rally for a couple of weeks of gains into new-high ground. This fast recovery into new highs is a sell signal and means that a stock could be topping.At times, the pullback will send the stock to its 10-week moving average, typically in heavy volume. This two weeks down and two weeks up sell signal generally occurs after a long uptrend.Keep watch for variations of this sell signal. Sometimes it can be one week down, followed by two or three weeks up to a new high.In late October 2007, Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) fell for three straight weeks (1), but found support at its 10-week moving average.At this point, the decline looked normal; it was a fine start to a potential new base. Volume during the latter two weeks cooled down, another good sign.The leading maker of robotic surgical systems then rose for three weeks in a row. The result: a faulty V-shaped base that was five weeks long, one week short of the six-week minimum length for a cup pattern.The good times didn't last, as Intuitive Surgical soon reversed lower and slumped 37% over the next few weeks before getting support at its 40-week line (2).What if you had bought the stock as it cleared the V-shaped cup? By keeping losses small, you would have avoided serious pain in your portfolio. So always cut your losses short at 7%-8% maximum. If the stock action doesn't look right, by all means sell more quickly.(Editor's Note: This piece originally published in the April 30, 2013, edition of IBD.)

415,QCOM,"More positive comments were issued Monday on reports that Qualcomm (QCOM) is looking to acquire NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) for at least $30 billion, or about $90 a share.RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani raised his price target on Qualcomm to 70 from 59. He maintained a sector-perform rating but upped his price target to reflect the increased potential for a more diversified company with higher earnings per share and free cash flows that the deal could generate.Dow Jones said a deal could be struck in the next two to three months. It would create the second-largest chip company by revenue after Intel (INTC). Qualcomm is the leading supplier of cellphone chip sets. NXP makes high-performance mixed-signal processors for communications, security, automotive and industrial applications. Among its biggest customers are Apple (AAPL), Bosch, Ericsson (ERIC), Samsung and Nokia (NOK).""While the NXP transaction is certainly much larger vs. what investors had contemplated,"" Daryanani said in a research note, ""we think it offers Qualcomm with several unique assets to further enable diversity away from their 90% mobility exposure.""UBS analyst Stephen Chin also views the NXP deal positively.""If Qualcomm were to acquire NXP, we estimate sales exposure to the smartphone market would drop from about 90% of its current total to 68% overall,"" Chin wrote.Chin has a neutral rating on Qualcomm and a price target of 59. Assuming a deal is struck, Chin estimates a possible Qualcomm price target of 80, due to stronger revenue diversity.Qualcomm stock slid 2% to 67.11 on the stock market today. Qualcomm jumped 8% over two days last week as word of the possible deal was first revealed. NXP stock rose 0.7% to 102.76 on Monday. The stock is up 25% since reports of merger talks broke.IBD'S TAKE: Qualcomm sports an IBD Composite Rating of 92, meaning it has outperformed 92% of stocks over the past year based on a select group of IBD metrics. It also has a solid Accumulation/Distribution Rating of B, indicating that institutional investors have been buying the stock.Last week, investment bank Mizuho raised its rating on Qualcomm stock to buy from neutral, with a price target of 75.

He said earnings estimates for Western Digital are positioned to keep inflecting higher through the end of 2016.Western Digital stock closed up 0.7% at 58.86.Daryanani raised his price target on Seagate to 40 from 34, with a sector perform rating.

Shares rose 4.99, or 4%, to 121.64 after paring a larger gain.

But a large acquisition would be uncharacteristic of Qualcomm, he said.""Management has mentioned on a number of occasions that they gravitate toward smaller, tuck-in acquisitions,"" Garcha said.Qualcomm's two largest acquisitions to date were its $2.4 billion purchase of CSR in 2015 and $3.1 billion purchase of Atheros Communications in 2011. By comparison, NXP has a market capitalization of about $35 billion.Qualcomm is considering other acquisition targets as well, Garcha said. They could include Mellanox (MLNX), Xilinx, Qorvo (QRVO), Cavium (CAVM) and Silicon Laboratories (SLAB).Garcha rates Qualcomm stock as outperform, with a price target of 70.RELATED:NXP Semiconductors Rockets On Qualcomm Acquisition Report

435,QCOM,"U.S. stock indexes held the high ground Friday afternoon, backfilling most of the previous session's losses.The Nasdaq and S&P 500 plowed ahead 0.9% each, while the blue chip Dow Jones industrial average rose 1.1%. Small caps matched the Dow as the Russell 2000 gained 1.1%. Volume in the stock market today was lower on the NYSE but higher on the Nasdaq.Chip stocks continued to show strength. The Philadelphia semiconductor index, known as the SOX, hit a new 52-week high for the second straight day. SOX components scoring big gains included NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), up 6; Qorvo (QRVO), up 4%; Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR), up 4.5% and at a new high; and Qualcomm (QCOM), up 2% and at a 52-week high.Rumors said Qualcomm was in talks to buy NXP Semiconductors.Blue chip stocks were up without exception in the 30-stock Dow. Caterpillar (CAT) rose for a fourth consecutive session with daily gains of 0.6%, 4.5%, 1% and so far today, 1.%.

436,QCOM,"Stocks marched even higher after a healthy open on Friday, and big-cap techs resumed their rally after some quiet pullbacks during the week.Apple (AAPL), for instance, rebounded 0.5% to 112.74 in volume that was running more than 30% above typical pace as of 12 p.m. ET, a good sign that institutional demand is still fierce. Qualcomm's (QCOM) potential bid to scoop up NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) is also powering interest in the chip and wireless tech space.The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 gained 0.8%. The Dow Jones industrials slightly outperformed, up 0.9%. In the price-weighted Dow 30, as many as 11 rose 1 point in more.The S&P, in contrast, is market-cap weighted, so names such as Apple garner more heft in that large-cap benchmark's performance.Small-caps marched in lock step with the big caps; the Russell 2000 gained nearly 1% and was poised for a Q3 gain of more than 8%.Friday's rebound is interesting in light of the news that U.S. personal spending actually fell 0.1% in August, below the Econoday forecast for a 0.2% lift month over month. Yet major discount chains, automakers, supermarket and consumer electronics retail groups led the market's upside.Apple broke out of a solid long cup with handle with a 110.33 buy point on Sept. 14 following reports that it's seeing solid preorders for the latest iPhone models. It's within the 5% permissible buy zone, which extends up to 115.85.The heavy cloud hanging over the company's long-term future will be the question of whether the most successful tech company from 2004 to 2014 in terms of stock market performance can create yet another blockbuster product or service.At the same time, it cannot be ignored that Apple, loaded with cash and only mildly levered (its latest fiscal 2015 year shows a long-term debt to shareholders equity ratio of 45%) is becoming an attractive play for income investors. The annualized cash payout of $2.28 a share presently gives stockholders a yield of 2%.That 2% yield is in line with the S&P 500, but the company's long-term dividend growth rate is superlative at 31%, according to calculations by IBD sister firm William O'Neil + Co.Elsewhere in the stock market today, Facebook (FB) edged up less than 0.2%, getting closer to staging another breakout attempt past a 128.43 pivot point. The world's No. 1 social network hasn't made much progress from that entry but is up more than 22% year to date.Biogen (BIIB), up 2% to 312.30 in heavy trading, is preparing for a potential breakout of its own, as the big-cap biotech play continues to straddle its upward-sloping 50-day moving average, a critical support level. The maker of highly innovative medicines for multiple sclerosis is also venturing into other difficult-to-treat chronic diseases.Biogen's earnings per share had soared $4.12 in 2009 to $17.01 in 2015 — equal to a compounded annual growth rate of 27%. But profit increases are now slowing; the Street sees an 18% lift this year to $20.10 a share and a 4% gain in 2017.Back to its chart, Biogen has dropped more than 54% since peaking at 480.18 in March of 2015. So the current action resembles that of big stock market winners that produced ""bottoming bases"" after the 2008-2009 Wall Street meltdown.RELATED:Know Your Chart-Reading Skills: What Is A Bottoming Base?When Did Apple's Shares Break Out?Why Is Qualcomm Going Hunting?

437,QCOM,"The stock market extended gains Friday morning as investors mulled fresh consumer confidence data. Procter & Gamble (PG) and Wal-Mart (WMT) were early leaders in the Dow with gains of about 2%.The Dow Jones industrial average outperformed with a 1% gain; the S&P 500 added 0.9% and the Nasdaq composite gained 0.8%. Small caps lagged somewhat with the Russell 2000 up 0.7%.In economic news, consumer sentiment hit 91.2 in September, slightly above the consensus estimate of 90.1, according to latest data from the University of Michigan.Negative headlines in the financial sector weighed on stocks Thursday as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq suffered another distribution day. Shares of Deutsche Bank (DB) rebounded 12% early Friday on reports of a possible Justice Department settlement after slumping 7% Thursday to a record low.  Shares of Wells Fargo (WFC), meanwhile, rose 0.3% as the banking giant remained mired in a cross-selling scandal. Since hitting a high of 51 on Sept. 1, shares are down about 13%In the stock market today, Costco (COST) jumped 4% after the retailer reported adjusted profit of $1.77 a share, slightly better than expected and up 2% from the year-ago quarter. Sales also rose 2% to $36.56 billion.IBD'S TAKE: Costco's industry group, Retail-Major Discount Chains, ranks near the bottom of IBD's 197 industry group rankings. Big profits can be made in the stock market by looking at leading stock in leading industry groups.NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) added more than 8% after soaring 17% Thursday on reports that Qualcomm (QCOM) is a potential suitor. Qualcomm rose nearly 4% after rising 6% Thursday.Volume was heavy in chipmaker Macom (MTSI) Thursday as shares rose 1% to 41.10. Shares rose nearly 3% Friday.

438,QCOM,"Shares of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) soared Thursday on a report that the company might be acquired by Qualcomm (QCOM).NXP stock shot up as much as 19% on the stock market today, matching a 14-month high of 98.09, and ended the day up 17%, at 96.12. Qualcomm stock rose 6%, to 67.23.Dow Jones said a deal could be struck in the next two to three months. NXP Semiconductors has a market cap of more than $30 billion.San Diego-based Qualcomm has a market value of about $99 billion.A spokesman for NXP said it is company policy to never comment on rumors or speculation. Qualcomm didn't immediately return a request for comment.IBD'S TAKE: Big mergers often come with big challenges, and many never pan out. For an example of huge deal that so far is working out, look no further than the latest IBD 50 ranking of top-performing stocks over the past 52 weeks. Broadcom, a product of a merger completed early this year between Broadcom and Avago, resides at No. 46. More than that, Broadcom also is among IBD's Sector Leaders.Headquartered in the Netherlands, NXP makes high-performance mixed-signal processors for communications, security, automotive and industrial applications. Among its biggest customers are Apple (AAPL), Bosch, Ericsson (ERIC), Huawei, Hyundai, Nokia (NOK) and Samsung.If the NXP-Qualcomm merger occurs, it would be part of a wave of consolidation occurring in the chip sector.In May, disk drive maker Western Digital completed its $19 billion acquisition of flash chip company SanDisk. On Feb. 1, the biggest chip merger ever -- biggest merger of two tech companies ever -- was completed between Avago and Broadcom (AVGO), with the $37 billion combination taking the Broadcom name but keeping the Avago AVGO stock ticker. And in December, NXP completed its own huge deal, acquiring Freescale Semiconductor in a transaction valued near $12 billion.Qualcomm has been among chip companies reportedly looking for acquisitions, with Xilinx (XLNX) among companies it reportedly had eyed.RELATED:Apple Supplier NXP Parlays Freescale M&A To Outpace IndustryBig Chip-Gear Merger Points To Chip Field's Active M&A Environment
"
439,QCOM,"One highly dangerous investing approach that all traders in growth stocks ought to think over is ""averaging down.""It's one of the biggest myths in investing, particularly for high-growth companies. Don't confuse it with the cost-averaging method of long-term investing in a mutual fund or broad-based equity ETF.When a high-octane growth stock has topped, rarely does it come back quickly and lead the next market uptrend. In fact, many stocks don't approach their all-time highs for years.Just look at five former huge winners during the 1990s: Intel (INTC), Microsoft (MSFT), Oracle (ORCL), Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Qualcomm (QCOM).Intel this past week took out its December 2014 peak of 37.90. Yet shares are still miles below their August 2000 all-time high of 75.81. Qualcomm is up in 2016, yet it's still more than 37% below an all-time split-adjusted high of 100, seen in January 2000.""Averaging down"" means buying a stock, watching it drop and then buying more shares, resulting in a lower average price. You might hear people tell you that averaging down is a great idea, but in fact it's generally a risky way to operate.These folks will say something like: ""If you liked a stock at 64, then you should love it at 54."" They could be referring to a former high-profile stock such as pioneering smartphone maker BlackBerry (BBRY), formerly known as Research In Motion.That makes some sense, but here's another way to think about it that could save you some pain: If a stock has fallen below your purchase price, then it's quite simply a losing investment. When the losses approach 7%-8%, cut the stock loose and find a better name. You can sell the stock even more quickly if you judge the price and volume action to be negative.What if you ignore IBD's golden sell rule and instead opt to follow the stock lower? It means buying more shares could amount to throwing good money after bad, as the saying goes.Let's say you had bought BlackBerry in January 2011, as the stock cleared a possible buy point at 64.04 (1).There were some flaws with this breakout, such as an overly deep base, but you jumped in anyway.In any case, the breakout didn't provide much upside, and pretty quickly you would have had an opportunity to average down.And this example shows why averaging down is often a bad strategy. BlackBerry continued to drop, so you really would have been throwing good money after bad if you added to your position in March (2) or April (3) or later.You should have been selling your original position to avoid further losses, rather than adding to it. BlackBerry tripped some key IBD sell rules, such as by falling 8% below 64.04 and penetrating its 10-week and 40-week moving averages in heavy turnover.Also, there's a big opportunity cost. By keeping your money in a dog, you're losing the chance to invest in a market leader.(Editor's Note: This column originally ran in the March 27, 2012, edition of IBD.)RELATED:Know the golden rule of selling stocksA dive below the 50-day moving average is a key sell rule

440,QCOM,"Apple (AAPL) supplier Qualcomm (QCOM) leads Broadcom (AVGO), Qorvo (QRVO) and Integrated Device Technology (IDTI) in the Samsung Galaxy Note 7, industry tracker iFixit found Thursday in a teardown of Samsung's newest phablet.Qualcomm boasts six chips inside the latest of ""Samsung's line of phones-that-don't-fit-in-your-pocket,"" iFixit wrote in a teardown report. The Galaxy Note 7 touts an Apple iPhone 6S-quashing battery. But its power falls short of the Galaxy S7 Edge.Among Qualcomm's offerings -- a processor, an audio codec, two radio-frequency chips and two power management chips. Fellow RF Qorvo chipmaker brings three chips to the mix: a high-band RF fusion module, a front-end module and a receiver.IBD'S TAKE: Dot-com boom darling Qualcomm sports a fast-growing dividend. Check out IBD's Dividend Leaders.Broadcom has at least one confirmed chip, but its Wi-Fi system-on-a-chip is also likely contained within Samsung's Wi-Fi module, iFixit found. Samsung itself supplies two other chips for flash memory and dynamic random-access memory (DRAM).Integrated Device Technology supplied a wireless power receiver, an iteration of the component it supplies for the Apple Watch.The chipset is nearly identical to those of the S7 and S7 Edge, iFixit found. The Note 7 scored a four out of a best-possible 10 in repairability. Many of the components can be replaced independently, but the chassis is vulnerable to cracking.Noted iFixit, ""Because of the curved screen, replacing the front glass without destroying the display is probably impossible.""In afternoon tradingIntegrated Device Technology stock closed up 3.25% on the stock market today, and Qorvo rose 1.2%. Broadcom ticked up 0.5%, and Qualcomm added 1.2%. Apple stock dipped 0.1%.

441,QCOM,"No. 1 chipmaker Intel (INTC) is sidling up to Apple (AAPL) and the burgeoning Internet of Things market via a partnership with longtime rival ARM Holdings (ARMH) to manufacture some of its chips, the companies said Tuesday.The partnership was announced at the Intel Developer Conference in San Francisco. It gives Intel a stronger foothold in the ""mobile, IoT and other consumer"" markets as the longtime top maker of PC chips shifts course to growth markets.IBD'S TAKE: ARM is set to be acquired by SoftBank in a $32 billion deal. But analysts posited in July that Intel could have swooped in to buy ARM before SoftBank in an attempt to buy its way into the hard-won mobile market.Intel is essentially becoming a foundry manufacturer for ARM's partners. There, it will compete with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) and Samsung for business from key customers such as Apple and Qualcomm (QCOM).Specifically, ARM is licensing its Artisan platform for complex systems-on-a-chip and processor technology to Intel for use on its 10-nanometer process, said Zane Ball, vice president for technology and manufacturing group and co-general manager of Intel Custom Foundry, in the announcement.""Foundry customers can take advantage of the IP to achieve best in class power, performance area for power-efficient, high-performance implementations of their designs for mobile, IoT and other consumer applications,"" Zane said in a company blog post.Combining ARM's processor and physical design with Intel's integrated device manufacturing will allow for quicker knowledge transfer and lower risk, said Will Abbey, general manager for ARM's physical design group, in the announcement. He called the collaboration ""tremendous.""The initial yield will be for two processor cores for mobile or stand-alone apps, Abbey said.Zane also announced that Intel had won business from LG Electronics. LG will use Intel's 10-nm process to produce a ""world-class mobile platform,"" he said.The mobile business is important to Intel which, in April, announced plans to cut 12,000 jobs and a restructuring amid sloping PC sales.Rumors have circled over for months suggesting that Apple tapped Intel to source some of its iPhone 7 modems. Partnering with ARM puts Intel one step closer to that coveted business. Apple's iPhone and iPad chips are based on ARM's architecture.On the stock market today, Intel fell 0.5% to 35.02. Shares are up 2% for the year.Meanwhile, IBD's 39-company Electronic-Semiconductor Manufacturing industry group has climbed to No. 35 out of 197 groups tracked, up from No. 169 13 weeks ago.

Intel stock rose 3% and reached a more than 15-year high of 38.05 on Friday.IBD'S TAKE: Intel stock is at longtime highs but ranks just No. 7 on IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Manufacturing industry group (which doesn't include fabless chipmakers). See which are the top-rated chip stocks, and why, at IBD Stock Checkup.Investment bank Jefferies raised its price target on Intel stock to 49 from 44 and kept its buy rating.Mizuho raised its price target on Intel to 42 from 38 and reiterated its buy rating.Needham upped its price target on Intel to 43 from 38 and kept its buy rating.Nomura raised its PT on Intel to 42 from 38 and maintained its buy rating.Pacific Crest Securities increased its PT on Intel to 42 from 38 and reiterated its overweight rating.Cowen maintained its market perform rating on Intel, but upped its price target to 38 from 36.UBS upped its price target on Intel to 43 from 40 and reiterated its buy rating.Baird raised its PT on Intel to 42 from 40 and kept its outperform rating.Early Friday, Intel said it expects third-quarter revenue of $15.3 billion to $15.9 billion vs. its prior range of $14.4 billion to $15.4 billion. The chip giant largely credited ""replenishment of PC supply chain inventory"" but also is ""seeing some signs of improving PC demand.""The midpoint of its Q3 sales guidance would be a 7.8% yearly gain, its best since Q3 2014.Intel's commentary on an improving PC business bodes well for PC makers HP Inc. (HPQ) and Apple, RBC Capital Markets said in a report Friday. Apple is expected to update its Mac computer lineup in October.UBS analyst Stephen Chin said PCs remain a driver for Intel's stock since the segment accounts for 53% of sales.""One outstanding question is whether this was a one-time benefit (for Intel's Q3) or the result of better consumer interest in new products and replacement of older PCs,"" Chin said in a report.In addition to improving PC sales, Intel is likely to benefit from better performance in its data center chip business, Nomura analyst Romit Shah said in a report Friday.""The Broadwell-E server refresh should drive stronger results in the second half of the year,"" Shah said.

446,QCOM,"It's pretty common for top-rated growth stocks in IBD's database to show outstanding fund sponsorship. So it's no surprise that four names in Friday's Sector Leaders screen are current holdings of Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX), a highly respected growth fund with a long-term track record of success.The fund, with total assets near $110 billion, boasts a 15-year total return of about 9.5% compared with 7.1% for the S&P 500.  Since the start of the bull market in March 2009, the fund is up about 200% compared with a 166% gain for the S&P 500.Contrafund owns just over 300 stocks. For a growth fund, the turnover rate is relatively mild at 35%. Portfolio turnover is a measure of how frequently assets within a fund are bought and sold by the portfolio managers.Among the fund's top-25 holdings, Sector Leader Facebook (FB) is the top-weighted stock at 5.96%. The longtime leader is still holding near highs, although gains have slowed in recent months.After its May 2012 IPO at 38, Facebook plunged to a low of 17.55 in early September of that year. Shares are up more than 600% since then. Three other Sector Leaders are current holdings of Contrafund.Broadcom (AVGO), featured in Wednesday's Sector Leaders column, just completed a new flat base with a 179.52 buy point. Semiconductor stocks have been standout performers in the market in recent months, and the sector was helped even more Thursday when NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) soared after Qualcomm (QCOM) was mentioned as a possible suitor.GrubHub (GRUB), which provides a mobile platform for restaurant pickup and delivery orders, continues to perform well after reporting solid earnings and sales in late July. Growth concerns plagued the company in 2015, but the company's latest earnings report revealed a company firing on all cylinders. Earnings per share jumped 35% from a year ago. Sale growth was also impressive, rising 37% to $120.2 million. For the full-year, earnings are seen rising 24% to 84 cents a share with growth accelerating in 2017, up 31%.Arista Networks (ANET), a provider of software-driven cloud networking solutions for data centers, also sports sound fundamentals and a compelling growth story. An ongoing legal battle with Cisco Systems (CSCO) hasn't affected shares much in recent months, perhaps in anticipation of a future settlement that won't hurt business too much at Arista. In June, right around the time that Arista bottomed at 60.51, the International Trade Commission upheld a ruling by a U.S. trade judge in February, saying that Arista infringed on three of Cisco's patents with its Ethernet switches used in data centers and servers.

There, Intel unveiled a partnership with ARM Holdings (ARMH) and a ""merged reality"" headset.On the stock market today, Intel shares rose 0.8% to 35.24. Shares are up 1.9% for the week.

Intel continues to diversify across its varying segments, and CEO Brian Krzanich is demonstrating a ""relatively new sense of market pragmatism,"" he wrote in a research report.Ramsay noted Intel's licensing agreement with British Apple (AAPL) supplier (and longtime rival) ARM Holdings which is in the process of being acquired by SoftBank (SFTBY). Intel will make some of ARM's chips for mobile and IoT.""The newly announced ARM physical IP license deal is a prime example of this pragmatism,"" he wrote. ""(It's) hard to imagine such a deal from Intel five years ago.""Competitors like Qualcomm, NXP and Nvidia have early leads in virtual reality, autonomous driving and IoT, Ramsay acknowledged. But innovations across Intel's varied product lines should drive double-digit growth in its data center unit.IBD'S TAKE: Intel isn't alone is reaping the benefits from its Apple exposure.  Applied Materials stock rocketed to a 16-year high Friday on its consensus-busting fiscal Q4 guidance. The maker of chip gear sees its OLED exposure being three times that of traditional LCD.There, Ramsay sees a $1 billion incremental opportunity — the same potential he sees for Tesla Motors (TSLA) partner Nvidia. Nvidia makes graphics processing units (GPUs) which can be used to handle high-performance computing workloads.But Intel's Knights Landing central processing unit (CPU) is also used to train machines.And Intel has already made a big foray into supplying the Super 7 — Google (GOOGL), Facebook (FB), Amazon.com (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), Alibaba (BABA), Baidu (BIDU) and Tencent (TCEHY), he said. Those seven have huge high-performance computing needs.""We believe the data center accelerator market will be quite fragmented in the long term,"" he wrote. ""And the competitive debate between Nvidia and Intel is both overhyped and oversimplified by investors relative to each company's financial fundamentals.""Related:SoftBank 'Crazy Idea' Beats Intel To Punch On Apple Supplier ARMIntel Developer Forum Spotlights Apple-, Google-, Tesla-Rivaling Segments

451,QCOM,"Action-camera maker GoPro (GPRO) is set to unveil its Karma drone on Monday, but many observers are wondering if the company will price itself out of the fast-growing market.Karma is expected to cost more than $500 without a camera, bringing the price of a GoPro flying-camera system to $900 to $1,000, Dougherty analyst Charles Anderson said in a research report Tuesday. Karma will debut at a time when the growth driver for the market is expected to be drones with 4K cameras costing $500 or less, he said.IBD'S TAKE: GoPro stock carries a poor IBD Composite Rating of 12, meaning it has been outperformed by 88% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months. It ranks No. 10 out of 11 companies in IBD's Computer Products-Electronic industry group. To see which company leads the group, check out the IBD Stock Checkup.At last week's InterDrone trade show in Las Vegas, industry officials were mixed on GoPro's prospects in the drone market, Anderson said.""Some in the industry felt as though GoPro would not be competitive with the likes of the Yuneec Breeze and the DJI Mavic given an expectation that the Karma will be $500-plus without an attached camera,"" Anderson said in the report. ""Others felt as though GoPro's brand, distribution and installed base of drone-ready cameras would be enough to give it a strong initial ramp.""A major trend at InterDrone 2016 was the emergence of the sub-$500 consumer drone with 4K video, Anderson said.Yuneec showed off its $499 Breeze drone, which is controlled by a smartphone app as opposed to an expensive joystick common in the industry.""The Breeze struck us as the most consumer-friendly drone we've ever seen and includes multiple semiautonomous modes including 'follow me' and 'selfie mode' — whereby users set a certain height and distance from the themselves and the drone levitates on its own,"" Anderson said.Market leader DJI is expected to debut its low-cost Mavic drone this month.Yuneec is going to get as much as 10 feet of shelf space for its products at Best Buy (BBY) this holiday and the drone category will get nearly 30 feet total at Best Buy stores, Anderson said.Also at the InterDrone show, video processor maker Ambarella (AMBA) continued to be the industry standard on 4K drones, with Qualcomm (QCOM) lagging far behind, Anderson said.Dougherty rates GoPro and Ambarella stocks as neutral. GoPro stock rose 2.1%, to 13.07, in the stock market today. Shares hit a seven-month high of 16.25 on Aug. 15. Ambarella stock was up 2.4% to 67.43. Shares touched a nearly one-year high just shy of 73 on Aug. 31.GoPro may use its Karma unveiling to also launch its Hero 5 action camera and possibly a handheld gimbal accessory, Oppenheimer analyst Andrew Uerkwitz said in a report Tuesday.He rates GoPro stock as perform and expects the company's products to face a lot of competition for consumer spending this holiday season. GoPro's cameras and drones will compete not only with similar products, but also with virtual-reality headsets, wearables, video game consoles and new smartphones.RELATED:Why The Next Apple Could Come From A Drone WildcatterWhat It's Like To Quit Your Job To Be A Competitive Drone RacerWhat's Next For Drones?

452,QCOM,"First, the good news for Friday. Stocks closed out a tough day at session highs and semiconductor ETFs defied a broad sell-off.Gains for exchange traded funds invested in chipmakers came amid an earnings beat for Applied Materials (AMAT), with the stock gapping up 7.1%.SPDR S&P Semiconductor (XSD) popped 1.4% on the stock market today for an all-time closing high of 50.79. Reports for Q2 earnings have given the chipmaker segment a boost. Heavyweights that have beaten expectations include Intel (INTC) and Qualcomm (QCOM).The tech-heavy Nasdaq has now risen for eight consecutive weeks.However, the major index-tracking ETFs slid lower Friday with losses extending widely across stock, bond and commodity sectors. Some market watchers attributed the cautious investor sentiment to a slew of recent hawkish comments from Federal Reserve officials.Utilities led the decline in the S&P 500, falling 1.2%. Materials eked out a gain of 0.2%.Even ""safer"" equity plays such as Vanguard Dividend Appreciation (VIG) managed only to eke out a 0.1% gain.Foreign developed and emerging markets fared even worse Friday.SPDR Euro Stoxx 50 (FEZ) gave up 0.9%. IShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets (IEMG) lost 0.6%.Gold, a safe-haven asset, also pegged losses as the dollar rose against a basket of other major world currencies. Some commodities took a harder pounding than gold, though U.S. oil futures rose.United States Natural Gas (UNG) stumbled 3.8%. IShares Silver Trust (SLV) slumped 2.2%.Bond and income-oriented ETFs did little better.Vanguard Extended Duration (EDV), investing in longer-dated government bonds, dipped 0.6%.IBD'S TAKE: Compare and contrast the performance of exchange traded funds at ETF Center.The volatility index rose Friday amid the stock, bond and commodity sell-off. The CBOE Volatility Index is a key measure of market expectations of near-term volatility measured through S&P 500 stock index option prices. It is considered by many to be a barometer of investor sentiment and market volatility, and is often referred to as the fear index or fear gauge.IPath S&P 500 VIX Short Term Futures ETN (VXX), which offer short-term VIX futures exposure, added 0.4%. However, it sits at its lowest level in the past year after falling for the eighth-straight week as the stock market rallied.Despite the caution Friday, the major indexes including the S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average continue to hold near all-time highs.Here's how major exchange traded funds across major asset classes performed today, with IBD Relative Price Strength Ratings.The RS Rating is a measure of a stock's price performance over the last 12 months, compared with all stocks and ETFs, on a scale of 1 to a best-possible 99.Following daily ETF market action can be key to successful investing:SPDR S&P 500 (SPY), -0.1%, RS 53PowerShares QQQ (QQQ), 0%, RS 64SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA), -0.5%, RS 53IShares Core S&P Mid-Cap (IJH), +0.1%, RS 64IShares Russell 2000 (IWM), 0%, RS 64IShares MSCI EAFE (EFA), -0.7%, RS 32Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets (VWO), -0.6%, RS 7gSPDR Gold Shares (GLD), -0.9%, RS 66United States Oil (USO), +0.4%, RS 26IShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond (AGG), -0.2%, RS 32PowerShares DB U.S.$ Bullish (UUP), +0.4%, RS 2IPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures (VXX), +0.4%, RS 1

453,QCOM,"LAS VEGAS -- The speed limit of a Terminator is 25 miles per hour, quipped Jeff Melrose, principal technology strategist for Yokogawa US, on Wednesday. And the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration just ruled it illegal to shoot down a drone.But that's not what Melrose finds most disconcerting about the rapid acceleration (both literal and figurative) of drone technology. DJI's Phantom 4 Drone, a newbie to the market, has a three-mile range, 24-minute-plus flight time and can travel 45 mph.It can also track people.""No one expects the e-chainsaw,"" Melrose told a several-hundred-thick crowd at the Black Hat cybersecurity conference in Las Vegas. ""Drones allow (digital) attacks at a long distance, and drones can tailgate workers as easily as people.""Electronic warfare may come across as a trope out of Arnold Schwarzenegger's most famous series, but it's rooted in reality, Melrose said. And corporate espionage is just as much a certainty as that of nation-state actors.New Jersey truck driver Gary Bojczak was neither, but in 2013 he found himself in hot water after buying a jammer to thwart his company's GPS tracking efforts.The jammer worked too well. Bojczak's work took him near Newark Liberty Airport where his jammer -- a sub-$100 device -- shuttered a GPS-based guidance system. Federal authorities fined him $32,000 after tracing the signal to his truck.Drones compound the problem, Melrose says. Operating on the inverse square law, the closer a transmitter gets to a network, the stronger it becomes. Drones carrying transmitters can get really close ... and fences mean absolutely nothing when your weapon flies.A drone like DJI's newest iteration tracks moving objects autonomously and is capable of bringing a transmitter close enough to cause interference. Jammers are illegal, Melrose noted. But corporate spying and sabotage is nothing new.Industrial-tied businesses should secure overhead access and be aware of gaps in the wireless spectrum that roving electronic warmongers might skip. Interference isn't the only attack vector. A drone can steal visible information or perch for long-term surveillance.""You might only have 25 minutes of flying time, but once it's sitting there, it can virtually record forever,"" he said. ""You have to start telling your physical security guys to check in odd places. You might find drones hanging out in strange places.""Last month at the Warsaw Summit, the North Atlantic Treaty Alliance (NATO) officially recognized cyberspace as a military domain. That's important in Ukraine, where Russian forces have occupied portions of the country since 2014.That's also important more broadly where peacetime countries now face many decisions regarding peacetime hacking and the extent of allowable surveillance, says Kenneth Geers, a senior research scientist for security firm Comodo, who is based in Ukraine.""What can you do in peacetime? How do the laws of war apply in cyberspace?"" he asked. ""We have to get busy in peacetime if you want to be successful in wartime. That means you need a clearly stated policy of deterrence and the ability to enforce policy against your adversary.""Although Ukraine isn't a NATO member, it's likely some of those parallels will play out there. Over the past two years, the death toll in Ukraine has rocketed into the thousands. Now, armed with ""weapons of mass disruption,"" both sides are entering the digital realm.In 2014, a virus crippled Ukraine's Central Election Commission system ahead of the presidential election, and last December, hackers cut power to more than 230,000 people. Both countries have hacked smart billboards to display their own messaging.Closer to home, the Democratic National Committee discovered in June that it had been hacked by two cyber-espionage groups with alleged ties to Russian military intelligence. One had been in the system for years, according to cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike. The other, for months.The key takeaway, says Geers, is that cyber warfare exists. And the digital front could soon intensify ground strikes, he said.""Hackers could turn out the lights for a while and confuse leadership,"" he said. ""Or the enemy has a zero day for an application on which you are dependent. Then, it might be a very long day on the battlefield.""It's not necessarily that Apple's (AAPL) iPhones are more secure than their Android counterparts, say Atredis Partners founders Shawn Moyer and Josh Thomas. The Cupertino, Calif.-based tech giant is simply better than Android at deploying updates.That's because Android is vastly more fragmented than Apple, running several operating systems vs. Apple's singular iOS.But those updates can only go so far if the hardware is infected, Moyer and Thomas said. From an internal perspective, Apple and Android aren't dramatically different. Chipmakers like Qualcomm (QCOM), Broadcom (AVGO), NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) supply the lot.And the vast majority -- Windows and BlackBerry (BBRY) included -- share hardware-based security measures like TrustZone and Boot Loader, both of which are handled on the processor. So a bug impacting Qualcomm's system-on-a-chip could, theoretically, disrupt 60% of the phones on the market today.Exploits gouging TrustZone and Boot Loader circumvent mobile-device management, which pushes out software updates but can do little for a hardware-based bug, Moyer said. As the Bring Your Own Device trend burgeons, he suggested enterprises only support devices running the newest operating system.Therein lies Apple's dominance. For years, Android only pushed patches every six months. But that's too infrequent in today's attack landscape, they said. Apple users are better trained to accept updates transmitted digitally, leaving the fragmented Android market twirling in the wind.Android users aren't acquiescing to vendors' hopes that they'll upgrade their smartphones every two years. Go to a cafe in Nairobi, Moyer says, ""You're going to see people using handsets you haven't seen for years."" That's unfortunate because Android often stops supporting older devices.""Almost every Apple device that's deployed is on the newest version or one version back,"" he said. ""People are saying Apple is winning security. This is one reason why. They're not necessarily better at security, they're just better at pushing upgrades.""

454,QCOM,"Apple's (AAPL) iPhone 7 news is seen as positive for Broadcom (AVGO), Cirrus Logic (CRUS) and Intel (INTC), but negative for Qualcomm (QCOM), according to Wall Street analysts.The iPhone 7 supports 25 radio-frequency bands vs. 23 bands in the iPhone 6S series.""Overall the increased RF content should remain a tailwind for RF suppliers as other handset (manufacturers) emulate the iPhone road map,"" Mizuho Securities analyst Vijay Rakesh said in a research report. The increased bands in the iPhone 7 will be especially positive for Broadcom, he said.The increased bands should benefit all RF suppliers, but Broadcom and Qorvo (QRVO) will benefit more than Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), Cowen analyst Timothy Arcuri said.IBD'S TAKE: Among Apple chip suppliers seen benefiting from the iPhone 7 launch, only Broadcom is on the IBD 50 list of top-performing stocks.Audio chipmaker Cirrus Logic will profit from Apple's decision to remove the analog audio jack from the iPhone 7 and include digital earbuds and an adapter with the new handset, Pacific Crest Securities analyst John Vinh said in a report.Cirrus Logic also will benefit from Apple adding a second speaker to the iPhone 7 to give it stereo sound, he said.""We anticipate an incremental $2.50 in content associated with the Lightning earpods, Lightning adapter and second stereo speaker,"" Vinh said. ""Despite the significant content increase, we believe much of this has already been built into guidance and stock expectations.""For that reason, he is sector weight, or neutral, on Cirrus Logic stock.It is unclear whether Cirrus Logic has content in Apple's new wireless earbuds called AirPods, Vinh noted. AirPods will go on sale in late October for $159 a pair.His ""favorite Apple-exposed suppliers"" are Analog Devices (ADI), Broadcom, InvenSense (INVN) and Skyworks.Suppliers getting content boosts from the iPhone 7 likely include ADI and Broadcom, RBC Capital Markets said in a report.ADI could get about 30% more content in the iPhone 7 vs. the iPhone 6S series after winning a processor for the camera module, RBC said. Analog Devices gets about 13% of its revenue from Apple.Broadcom also could see a 30% boost in content in the iPhone 7, RBC said. Broadcom gets about 15% to 18% of its revenue from Apple.The iPhone 7 is a negative for Qualcomm, because it could lose 20% to 25% of its baseband chip share in the new smartphone to Intel, BMO Capital Markets analyst Tim Long said in a report.Qualcomm is supplying CDMA versions of the iPhone 7 and Intel is supplying non-CDMA versions, which is based on the wireless technologies carriers use.Apple's iPhone 7 is seen as positive for memory suppliers Micron Technology (MU) and Western Digital (WDC) because the new handsets feature twice as much Nand flash data storage as last year's models.The iPhone 7 series has data storage from 32 gigabytes to 256 GB vs. the prior 16 GB to 128 GB.""Doubling Nand storage could further tighten Nand supply and set a trend toward 256-GB handset densities,"" Mizuho's Rakesh said. ""The increased Nand storage should drive further pricing and margin stability in an already tight Nand supply chain, which is a clear positive for MU and WDC.""Apple shares finished 2.6% lower on stock market today at 105.52, as its announcement carried few surprises. Broadcom dipped 0.3%, Qualcomm rose 0.4%, Intel was essentially flat, Cirrus Logic eased 0.15%, while Micron gained 1.7%.RELATED:Apple iPhone 7 Launch Not 'Insanely Great,' But 'Good Enough'

457,QCOM,"The biggest change in accounting standards since the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 will shake up how public companies book revenue, in many cases resulting in earlier recognition of sales.And the ripple effects could touch everything from earnings and taxes to bonuses, commissions and buyout decisions.The new FASB ""606"" rule developed by the Financial Accounting Standards Board takes effect in 2018 or fiscal 2019. It will affect many companies but likely will have the most impact on businesses with multiyear contracts, licensing revenue, contracts that peg revenue to performance benchmarks, or third-party sales distribution channels.In the short term, stock market investors will sometimes have a tougher task in discerning corporate trends because current financial results might not be comparable to previous quarters. Sales and earnings also might be more volatile, potentially affecting stock prices.""The new revenue recognition standard is one of the biggest accounting events we've ever seen,"" said Dusty Stallings, a partner at accounting giant PricewaterhouseCoopers. ""It's going to be a tough exercise for most companies.""IBD'S TAKE: The best stocks to buy usually are powered by a strong revenue stream. But smart investors look at revenue within the context of a company's overall financial performance. IBD calculates a unique rating for every stock that does just that. For an explanation and a list of stocks that rate highly now, read Paul Whitfield's new article ""Don't Judge Sales In A Vacuum.""Some of the businesses that could be most impacted are telecom stocks AT&T (T) and Verizon Communications (VZ) and computer software stocks such as Adobe Systems (ADBE) and Microsoft (MSFT), analysts say. AT&T stock rose 0.2% Friday to 43.16, while Verizon shares were off 0.5%. Adobe climbed 2% Friday and Microsoft 1%.Just about every tech company has said in regulatory filings that it's evaluating how the new standard could impact financial statements. That includes Apple (AAPL), Amazon.com (AMZN), Cisco Systems (CSCO), Facebook (FB), Intel (INTC), Salesforce.com (CRM) and Qualcomm (QCOM).But the new FASB 606 revenue standard will affect most other industries as well, including media, entertainment, aerospace, biotech, health care, construction, auto, defense, real estate and franchisers, such as restaurants. Boeing (BA), Walt Disney (DIS) and Gilead Sciences (GILD) are among stocks assessing the standard's impact.And companies will need to adapt more than just their financial statements. The revenue standard could impact sales commissions, bonuses, corporate taxes and debt covenants.RELATED COVERAGE:Verizon Brings In British Mobile War Veteran As T-Mobile And Sprint Pick Off SubscribersDisney And Comcast Pull Out Their Wallets To Get Ready For The 'Netflix Of VR'Microsoft Stock Breaks Out To New Highs, One Of 5 Big Stock Moves (Video)Sarbanes-Oxley financial reforms targeted fraud in the wake of accounting scandals at Enron, WorldCom and others.FASB 606 will make revenue recognition consistent across U.S. industries. Guidelines specific to the software and defense industries, for example, are going away.""Revenue recognition is all about when and how much,"" said Prabhakar Kalavacherla, a partner at another Big 4 accounting firm, KPMG. ""There is now going to be a unifying principal that is agnostic to industries.""For many software and some other tech stocks, the new standard might speed up the timing of revenue recognition vs. today's GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) guidelines. They'll have to recognize revenue immediately, not over the broad length of some contracts. Often, the companies won't know exactly what revenue to disclose, so they'll be asked to make more estimates and judgment calls rather than rely on the old rules.Computer makers and other companies that sell products through distributors likely will book more revenue upfront. They'll need to estimate, based on historical data, how much product will eventually be sold to end users through the distributors, and then book that amount.""Certain industries will recognize revenue sooner than they have in the past, and software is one example,"" Stallings said. ""But the change in guidance from the very strict rules today to the (new) requirement to make estimations is going to go across a lot of industries.""Key to the new accounting rules is that revenue must often be booked right away and not stretched out over time. AT&T and Verizon will likely book more revenue from smartphone sales upfront, rather than over the course of a lease contract or payment plan.If software companies fast-forward revenue recognition, there could be an uptick in acquisitions, says Todson Page, another partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers. That's because smaller companies may be more attractive takeover targets if deals are earnings-positive immediately, or at least within a few quarters.""From a deal justification point of view, it may help some buyers because it would allow them to reach GAAP accretion numbers quicker,"" said Page, PWC's U.S. technology deals leader.Changes on the top line, of course, can affect a stock's earnings.""The new revenue standard has the potential to change not only the top line, but also the bottom line,"" Wesley Bricker, deputy chief accountant of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said in a May speech.Earlier recognition of sales would help the bottom line at first, but it would lead to lumpier earnings overall, as more revenue is booked upfront and less over the duration of a contract or long-term license.Companies might have less deferred revenue that they book over time. Thus, the FASB 606 standard means they might have less leeway to manage earnings and meet consensus estimates by accelerating or deferring revenue.One broad aim of FASB 606 is to bring U.S. revenue recognition in line with international financial reporting standards, which are also being overhauled. A goal is to make it easier for investors to compare stocks across industries and countries, says KPMG's Kalavacherla, also a former member of the International Accounting Standards Board.Companies will have to chose just how to comply with the new standard. Some companies will opt to restate sales for some prior years, while others will take a modified compliance route, applying the new rules only to existing and future contracts as of the effective date.Telecom, media and entertainment companies are among those most likely to restate revenue, analysts say.And that likely would be the cleaner tack, says Kalavacherla. With the modified route, he says, less trend information will be available to investors and analysts. ""That comparative data will be lost,"" he said.In 2015, FASB delayed the effective date of the new revenue standard for one year to 2018 after companies asked for clarifications. Some companies are still griping.FASB has said it is not considering another delay. Some analysts, however, say the rules are still in flux.""The rules simply don't make sense right now,"" said John DiFucci, a software industry analyst at Jefferies.At a JPMorgan conference in May, some software companies hedged when asked how soon they'll be affected by the standard.The accounting changes come amid a huge change in the computer industry that finds software companies shifting from one-time licensing fees to subscription-based, software-as-a-service business models. Under the FASB 606 standard, only software that is ""continuously updated"" can be recognized over time — and that applies for most SaaS.Companies that have had SaaS business models from the start, such as Salesforce.com, might be less impacted by this change than others, analysts say. Adobe, Microsoft and Splunk (SPLK) are among software stocks that are transitioning to SaaS but still have considerable licensing revenue. The timing of revenue recognition for software licenses could be accelerated, says Citigroup.A KPMG survey found many companies are taking a wait-and-see approach. They haven't upgraded IT systems, recalculated contracts or taken other steps to comply with the new standard. Such companies are more likely to take the modified approach in complying with the standard, rather than restating financial statements.Since companies will need to make more estimates in revenue recognition, they'll need to disclose more historical and other data in footnotes, says KPMG, which will improve transparency, a plus for investors.The new standard also is a business opportunity for startups that offer financial software designed to help in revenue recognition. Among such companies are Leeyo Software, Zuora and Revstream.As Leeyo CEO Jagan Reddy told IBD: ""This is going to be a real challenge for auditors.""

458,QCOM,"Late Wednesday, No. 1 chipmaker Intel (INTC) reported a 6-cent earnings beat and Q2 sales that were slightly shy of Wall Street expectations, as PC and Internet of Things sales slipped from Q1, slightly offset by double-digit growth in its Altera unit.Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said the chipmaker is on track as it shifts its focus toward data center, IoT and programmable chips. Intel is the longtime leader in microprocessors that power PCs, but that sector is in a downshift and more people move to smartphones. Intel plans to cut $750 million in costs this year, and three months ago it announced it would cut its workforce by 12,000.""We're gaining momentum heading into the second half,"" Krzanich said in the company's earnings release. ""While we remain cautious on the PC market, we're forecasting growth in 2016 built on strength in data center, the Internet of Things and programmable solutions.""Some of that played out in Q2. For the quarter, Intel reported $13.5 billion in sales, up 2.6%, and 59 cents earnings per share ex items, down 5%. The consensus of 41 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters called for $13.54 billion in revenue and EPS of 53 cents.Its PC unit's sales fell 3% both sequentially and vs. Q2 2015, which is largely in line with broad PC industry trends. Industry tracker IDC this month said PC shipments fell 4.5% year over year in Q2, but that beat its projection for a 7.4% plunge.But Intel's key IoT unit saw sales fall 12% sequentially, though they rose 2% from the year-earlier quarter. Nonvolatile memory sales fell 1% quarter over quarter and 20% vs. last year.Programmable solutions, on the other hand, flew 30% sequentially. Intel acquired field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-maker Altera this year, a combination that some analysts say could rival Xilinx (XLNX) in FPGAs.Intel's data center sales lifted 5% year over year but fell 1% from Q1.Current-quarter guidance for $14.9 billion in sales ex items, plus or minus $500 million, beat analyst views for $14.6 billion. Intel didn't provide an EPS guide. Analysts model 64 cents, which would be flat.In after-hours trading, after releasing earnings, Intel stock was down 1%. Shares closed Wednesday's regular session up 1.5%, at 35.69. Shares are up 4% for the year on speculation that Apple (AAPL) might tap Intel to source some of its iPhone 7 modems, partially replacing incumbent Qualcomm (QCOM).
"
459,QCOM,"Late Tuesday, Apple (AAPL) iPhone chip supplier Qorvo (QRVO) is expected to report fiscal Q1 sales and earnings that toppled into the red vs. last year, but shares dawdled Monday for a fourth straight day, extended at least 20% from a buy point, a zone at which investors might want to lock in at least some profits.Qorvo stock is 21% extended from a 52.05 buy point out of a cup-with-handle formation achieved June 1. Shares rose 24% in 2016 year to date through Friday, and they closed up 0.4% at 63.47 on the stock market today.The company created from the January 2015 merger of TriQuint Semiconductor and RF Micro Devices is slated to report fiscal Q1 earnings after the close Tuesday. Analysts expect Qorvo to report $650.6 million in sales and $1.05 earnings per share ex items, each metric down 4% from the year-earlier period.Qorvo has guided to $650 million in sales and $1.05 EPS ex items.Sales declined for the first time in eight quarters in fiscal Q4, ended in March. And EPS fell for the second consecutive period. Analysts expect both metrics to re-accelerate and grow in fiscal Q2.IBD'S TAKE: Qorvo has an IBD Composite Rating of 89, meaning it performs in the top 11% of all stocks in terms of key metrics. IBD's 38-company Electronic-Semiconductor Manufacturing industry group is ranked No. 70 out of 197 groups tracked, climbing from No. 163 over two months.Last month, a Mizuho analyst predicted Intel (INTC) would source a third of Apple's iPhone 7 modems, displacing incumbent Qualcomm (QCOM) in some units. That would benefit Qorvo but hurt Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), said the Mizuho report.Qorvo has a ""legacy relationship"" in making chips compatible with Intel chips.

460,QCOM,"Higher-ups at Microsoft (MSFT), General Electric (GE), Netflix (NFLX), Delta Air Lines (DAL), and Intel (INTC) were among the insiders that made notable trades disclosed this week.Mason Morfit, a Microsoft director and president of investing firm ValueAct Capital, along with ValueAct Holdings and other similarly-named companies, reported the sale of 18 million Microsoft shares worth more than $1 billion.Microsoft's cloud services helped lift its quarterly results last week.Shares were up 0.2% for the week to 56.68 but are just below a 56.95 buy point.CEO Jeff Immelt this week bought 50,000 company shares worth around $1.6 million. In May, he disclosed the purchase of 67,600 company shares worth $2 million.The industrial conglomerate last week reported estimate-beating results, as it tries to transition into more of a tech-and-analytics outfit.GE shares ended the week down 2.9% to 31.14 after dropping out of buy range last week.Director Jay Hoag disclosed the purchase of 600,000 company shares worth $51.9 million.Netflix last week reported disappointing subscriber growth and third-quarter guidance, with competition from rival online video providers chipping away at the company's revenue.Shares are up 6.2% for the week to 91.24, after plunging 12.7% last week.CFO Paul Jacobson bought 25,000 shares of the air carrier this week. Earlier this month, Delta Chairman Richard Anderson disclosed a sale and options exercise of 758,000 shares for a total transaction value of $30.37 million.The company has said it wants to be the first network carrier to reach positive growth in unit revenue by the end of the year. But Credit Suisse this month said rising fuel costs, labor deals, foreign-exchange woes and insufficient corporate demand could keep the key operational metric in negative territory into next year.Delta shares were down 0.5% for the week to 38.75.COO James Rosenthal sold 91,426 shares of Morgan Stanley (MS), which last week reported second-quarter results that beat expectations.Those results came after the banking sector largely showed resilience during the quarter marked by increased tension before and after the U.K.'s vote to leave the European Union.Shares were down 0.7% for the week to 28.73.Qualcomm (QCOM) President Derek Aberle sold 22,653 company shares after Qualcomm reported fiscal quarterly results and guidance last week that beat analysts' estimates. Shares were up 2.3% to 62.58 this week.Intel Chairman Andy Bryant sold 445,095 company shares, after the chipmaker reported mixed quarterly results. Shares are up 0.7%.Qorvo (QRVO) CEO Robert Bruggeworth sold 10,000 company shares this week ahead of the company's fiscal Q1 report on Tuesday. Shares climbed 4.4% to 63.22.The three chipmakers also supply technology to Apple (AAPL), which topped earnings and sales forecasts this week.Insider transactions don't typically have a major impact on a stock or indicate major pending news. Rapid liquidation of all or most of an insider's holdings, however, can affect a stock.

461,QCOM,"Apple (AAPL) upped its Cirrus Logic (CRUS) content for the upcoming iPhone by 40% per unit, Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill said Thursday, after Cirrus Logic's late Wednesday beat-and-raise pushed shares to an all-time high.But Qualcomm (QCOM) displaced Cirrus Logic in the majority of Samsung's phones, causing portable audio sales to dip 8% year over year to $216.07 million. Still, those sales grew 15% sequentially, meaning Cirrus Logic is on track to hit its 15% target for fiscal 2017, Gill says.Cirrus Logic stock jumped 19% to close at 49.82 on the stock market today. Shares are 30% extended from a 38.24 entry point out of a cup-with-handle base achieved July 8. Investors are typically advised to take some profits at 20%.IBD'S TAKE: Cirrus Logic stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 80, meaning it performs in the top 20% of all stocks in terms of key metrics. It's in IBD's 41-company Electronic Semiconductor-Fabless industry group, which ranks No. 23 out of 197 groups tracked.For its fiscal Q1, Cirrus Logic reported 44 cents earnings per share ex items on $259.4 million in sales, down a respective 19% and 8% vs. last year. But both metrics crushed the consensus for $236.4 million and 28 cents.Current-quarter sales guidance for $380 million to $410 million would grow 29% at the midpoint, beating analysts' model for $322.6 million. Cirrus Logic didn't provide an EPS estimate, but the consensus put earnings at 66 cents a share, up a penny year over year.That guidance indicates a 40% dollar-content increase in Apple's iPhone 7 vs. the iPhone 6S which debuted in September 2015, Gill wrote in a research report. He reiterated his buy rating and boosted his price target to 55 from 50 on Cirrus Logic stock.Gill expects Cirrus Logic to see another 30% increase in chip content in the iPhone 8, expected to launch in fall 2017. Analysts have long-speculated Apple will eliminate the 3.5-millimeter headphone jack in the iPhone 7 and introduce noise-cancelling headphones in the iPhone 8.""At Apple, we believe Cirrus Logic is also well-positioned next year for the iPhone 8, which we believe will be the 'super' upgrade cycle,"" he wrote. ""Units should grow year over year.""Cirrus Logic could also see $450 million to $500 million in incremental Android sales over the next several years, Gill predicted. For fiscal 2018, Cirrus Logic will likely expand into mid-tier smartphones, see higher sales of noise-cancelling chipsets and additional amplifier sales.He forecasts 12% sequential growth in the September quarter as Apple ramps the iPhone 7 and a 30% sequential decline in March as it comes off that ramp.Pacific Crest's John Vinh agrees on Cirrus Logic's likely dollar-content gain in the iPhone 7 -- he models a 70% increase at an additional $2.50 per unit -- but isn't as bullish on Apple's upcoming smartphone.""Consistent with results seen from Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), Texas Instruments (TXN), AMS AG, Knowles and Dialog Semiconductor, Cirrus noted that it was seeing a more cautious iPhone 7 ramp compared to last year,"" he wrote in a report.Last week, Skyworks offered September-quarter EPS and sales guidance in line with Wall Street estimates, but which would both decline 6% vs. last year. Texas Instruments' Q3 guidance  this week topped analysts' views, but its strength in Q2 was largely on automotive sales. Personal electronics declined vs. last year, led by a dip in mobile phones.Component orders for the iPhone 7 are down 15%-20% vs. the iPhone 6S ramp in the second half of 2016, Vinh wrote. He kept his sector weight rating on Cirrus Logic which, he says, already reflects Wall Street speculation of boosted iPhone 7 dollar content.Cirrus Logic CEO Jason Rhode told analysts late Wednesday he doesn't expect ""outlandish unit growth in the mobile market,"" but he still sees a strong content-growth story.

462,QCOM,"Ambarella (AMBA) stock fell Friday as its better-than-expected guidance for the current quarter still disappointed analysts in some areas, and it didn't rid analysts of fears that the holidays could disappoint, with the company partly counting on success with the newest GoPro (GRPO) action camera, the Hero 5.""While the outlook for drone sell-in was a bit disappointing, we think management is being conservative; we could still see upside depending on demand,"" Pacific Crest Securities analyst Brad Erickson wrote in a research note late Thursday. He maintained his overweight rating on Ambarella stock and 75 price target.But Erickson also said that the company's October-quarter guidance disappointed in that ""we were looking for drones to be up quarter to quarter, vs. management's commentary of flat.""Ambarella makes video-compression and other types of chips used not only in GoPro action cameras and the emerging field of drones, but also in internet-based security cameras, automobiles and elsewhere.Consumer markets are approaching half of Ambarella's sales, Erickson said, ""so holiday sell-through is the key determinant for AMBA moving forward. If drone or GoPro sell-through is better than expected, upside to our (price) target is likely. We think drones in particular are set up to drive potential upside for AMBA.""But there's also downside should drones and the new Hero disappoint this holiday, Needham analyst N. Quinn Bolton said in his Friday research report, in which he maintained a hold rating on Ambarella stock.""Despite the positives, we see risk should sell-through of the strong holiday build prove weaker than expected,"" Bolton wrote.But Bolton also said he saw ""continued strength in drones and home security cameras offsetting expected weakness in wearable cameras"" and that the company's guidance reflected a ""strong holiday build for GoPro's new Hero5 camera and home security cameras, as well as a recovery in IP security cameras in China.""Bolton said Ambarella is increasing its share of the drone market, but wrote that as the market for video-processing technology rises, Ambarella could face increased pressure from some of the largest chipmakers, naming Broadcom (AVGO), Qualcomm (QCOM) and Intel (INTC).Ambarella posted a 39% year-over-year decline in EPS ex items for the quarter ended July 31, and a 23% decline in revenue, yet both measures beat Wall Street estimates. EPS, in fact, crushed estimates by 16 cents. Ambarella's current-quarter guidance also beat expectations, though the company expects its non-GAAP gross profit margin to slip this quarter vs. Q2.IBD'S TAKE: Ambarella is a favorite of institutional investors at the moment. How do you know? Its Accumulation/Distribution Rating. Ambarella has the best rating possible, A+, indicating that mutual funds are buying shares.

GoPro stock fell 2.75%.Ambarella stock fell more than 50% the second half of last year, as GoPro sales fell on saturation, competition and the lack of compelling new features.

468,QCOM,"Apple (AAPL) is looking to bolster its iPhone profits by pressuring component suppliers for price discounts, says RBC Capital Markets.""We think Apple has been pushing for price discounts from multiple suppliers as a way to dampen foreign-exchange headwinds Apple is facing on their own P&L heading into the iPhone 7 ramps,"" RBC analyst Amit Daryanani said in a research report Tuesday.As a result, Apple could see upside to its gross profit margin, which it guided as flat for the September quarter, he said.Some Apple suppliers could see downside to their earnings, especially where multiple vendors supply the same component, he said.Single-source suppliers to Apple should be more resilient, Daryanani said. They include Broadcom (AVGO) and Analog Devices (ADI), he said.IBD'S TAKE: Broadcom stock has a best-possible IBD Composite Rating of 99. It is the top-ranked stock in IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Fabless industry group. Broadcom is also on the IBD 50 list of top-performing stocks.A consistent trend from the June-quarter earnings season was Apple component suppliers guiding gross margins lower, Daryanani said.""Ten out of 11 suppliers that we tracked saw gross margins head lower for second-half 2016 vs. prior expectations (the only exception was TTM Technologies (TTMI)),"" he said.Daryanani rates Apple stock as outperform with a price target of 115. Apple stock rose 0.4% to 108.81 on the stock market today. Apple has risen for eight of the last 10 trading sessions, since reporting better-than-expected June quarter results and guiding Wall Street higher for the September quarter.Some chip companies get a majority of their revenue from Apple. And quite a few firms get 10% or more of their sales from supplying Apple. In his report, Daryanani spelled out which companies get the most business from Apple.Companies with the greatest exposure to Apple business include Dialog Semiconductor (75% of revenue), Cirrus Logic (CRUS) (66%), Foxconn (over 50%), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) (44%), Qorvo (QRVO) (32%), Advanced Semiconductor Engineering (ASX) (31%) and InvenSense (INVN) (30%).Companies with less exposure to Apple, but which still get a significant share of sales from the Cupertino, Calif.-based company, include: Knowles (KN) (25%), Jabil Circuit (JBL) (24%), TTM (20%), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) (16%), Pegatron (15%-25%), Broadcom (15%-20%), Analog Devices (13%), Qualcomm (QCOM) (13%), Texas Instruments (TXN) (11%) and Amphenol (APH) (10%).Companies with small exposure to Apple business include Intel (INTC) (3%-5%), Flextronics (FLEX) (3%-4%) and Nvidia (NVDA) (3%-4%), Daryanani said.

469,QCOM,"Broadcom (AVGO) will deliver a $50 million beat over Wall Street's fiscal Q3 views, helped by 20% Apple (AAPL) iPhone 7 gains and better-than-expected wired growth, Credit Suisse analyst John Pitzer predicted Tuesday.Still, Broadcom stock -- which early Tuesday touched a record high for the fifth day in the past seven trading days -- by one measure is cheap relative to its peers. It's up 15% since its fiscal Q2 report on June 2, which is in line with the much-followed Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOX). But IBD's 41-company Electronic-Semiconductor Fabless industry group is up 19% over that same period.For fiscal Q3 ended in July, Pitzer expects Broadcom to top consensus views for $3.76 billion in sales and $2.77 earnings per share ex items by $50 million and 5 cents, respectively. Broadcom is slated to report its fiscal Q3 earnings after the close Thursday.The beat will be ""driven by strong content gains and initial builds for the iPhone 7, a recovery in enterprise storage, better-than-expected growth in wired ... and likely continued operating expenses improvements,"" Pitzer wrote in a research report Tuesday.Pitzer boosted his price target on Broadcom stock to 200 from 180, reiterating an outperform rating on the stock. He's even more bullish on October-quarter sales, modeling a $50 million and 10 cent upside on the same catalysts.He models 20% Apple iPhone 7 gains, but says Broadcom could see content soar by as much as 30%-40%. Broadcom supplies a power amplifier module for the iPhone 6S, which debuted in September 2015, according to a teardown from iFixit.That will come as Apple reportedly cuts component orders for its iPhone 7 by 15%-20%, Pacific Crest analysts predicted last week. Broadcom, Analog Devices (ADI) and InvenSense (INVN) will withstand the haircut, thanks to other trends, the analysts said.Meanwhile, investors are eyeing Broadcom's penchant for accretive M&A.IBD'S TAKE: Broadcom is two quarters into its $37 billion behemoth combination with the former Avago Technologies. Before that, though, Avago had a strong history of making deals to further its growth.But Pitzer isn't as ready to jump on the Broadcom M&A bandwagon. On Monday, an MKM analyst posited Broadcom could seek a merger with Qualcomm (QCOM), though Xilinx (XLNX), Cavium (CAVM) or Marvell Technology (MRVL) would also fit the bill.""While M&A continues to be a focus for value creation (and management has a strong track record), we believe that a more balanced total returns story (buyback, dividend, debt pay down), would perhaps drive more equity value,"" he wrote.At the closing bell on the stock market today, Broadcom shares edged down 0.2% to 177.

In June, CEO Hock Tan said Broadcom will soon begin pulling excess cash for M&A.Meanwhile, Broadcom stock is range-bound as it mulls its M&A opportunities, Ing wrote in a research report. Ing kept his buy rating and 188 price target on Broadcom stock Monday ahead of the company's fiscal Q3 earnings report, due out late Thursday.""Investors now focus on how quickly they can do another accretive acquisition,"" he said. ""Our concerns center around the lack of remaining attractive deals available, given the framework of asset-light and OEM customer focus.""Broadcom could go after Qualcomm, he said, though Qualcomm's $92 billion market cap dwarfs Broadcom's $70.5 billion cap, and ""powerful smartphone customers may not embrace a single supplier across both 'digital baseband' and RF (radio frequency) content.""The duo supply chips for Apple iPhones.

ARM stock jumped 40% on the deal, lifting IBD's 41-company Electronic Semiconductor-Fabless industry group 1.9% Monday.IBD's TAKE: ARM ranks No. 9 in IBD's Electronic Semiconductor Fabless industry group, as IBD Stock Checkup shows. It has a Composite Rating of 95, meaning it performs in the top 5% of all stocks in sales growth and other key metrics. The group is led by Broadcom, which has a highest-possible CR of 99.For 2016, industry tracker IDC expects PC unit sales to decline 4.5%, down from earlier views for a 7.4% fall. Ramsay now forecasts Intel PC chip sales will fall 7% this year, where he had forecast an 8% fall.The U.K.'s decision to exit the European Union doesn't help, Ramsay wrote in a research report. Post-Brexit, the British pound declined 9.3% vs. the U.S. dollar to its lowest point in decades.Kaby Lake, a 14-nanometer central processing unit (CPU), is slated to succeed Intel's Skylake architecture next year. The 10-nm process, Cannonlake, has been delayed until the latter half of 2017. The thinner the nanometer manufacturing process, the more powerful the chip.Meanwhile, Intel's 14-nm Broadwell server CPUs are chugging into their first full quarter of sales, and second-generation Xeon Phi, Silicon Photonics and OmniPath fabric products should ""combine to push data center group growth back toward the midteens target,"" Ramsay wrote.""We believe the long-term business mix shift toward (data center) will lessen the exposure to consumer pricing pressures as sophisticated cloud-networking customers have shown willingness to buy up the Xeon stock,"" Ramsay wrote.He raised his 2016 earnings per share ex items estimate to $2.41 and his 2017 view to $2.78. Intel could source 30% of Apple's iPhone 7 modems, directly slugging incumbent Qualcomm (QCOM).
"
472,QCOM,"Intel (INTC) stock has rallied for seven straight sessions amid mounting rumors that the No. 1 chipmaker could displace Qualcomm (QCOM) in a chunk of Apple's (AAPL) iPhone 7s, ahead of Intel and Qualcomm earnings both slated for release after the close July 20.For Q2, Intel is expected to report $13.54 billion in sales ex items and 53 cents earnings per share minus items, rising by single digits vs. the year-earlier quarter. Three months ago, Intel guided to $13.5 billion in sales, plus or minus $500 million.S&P Global Market Intelligence analyst Angelo Zino rates Intel stock a buy, and theorized in a research report that confirmation during Intel's Q2 call of an Apple contract could send shares rocketing.IBD'S TAKE: Intel ranks fourth in its IBD industry group, a group that isn't anywhere near the top but has been on a roll. The Electronic-Semiconductor Manufacturing Group ranks just No. 80 out of 197 groups tracked, but it's worth watching after rising from No. 106 a week ago, No. 145 four weeks ago and No. 169 eight weeks ago.""If Intel is indeed confirmed as a manufacturing partner for Apple, it would make the first key mobile win for the company,"" Zino wrote. ""We expect Intel to manufacture about 20% of all modems for the iPhone 7 (and) 7 Plus, which will come directly at the expense of Qualcomm.""Mobile has been an albatross for Intel, the longtime leader in PC microprocessors. In 2014, Intel lost $4.2 billion in that unit and last year promised to curb those losses by $800 million. Recent rumors that Intel could displace Qualcomm in 20% to 50% of the upcoming iPhones would, if true, mean a boon for the company.Zino predicts that PC stabilization and cost reductions will act as tailwinds for Intel heading into the second half of 2016. In April, Intel announced it would cut 12,000 positions and consolidate programs to save $750 million this year as its PC segment struggles on a macro slowdown.The PC segment remains in secular decline, but will only fall by single digits this year vs. a 10% plunge in 2015, Zino forecasts. PCs still make up 60% of Intel's sales and 40% of its earnings, but that's an improvement over 85% and 15% five years ago.Intel is also pivoting to higher-growth data center, memory and internet of things markets. Data center will be driven by cloud investments and ""over time, we expect that the (data center group) business will comprise over half of Intel's total operating income,"" Zino said.Intel shares rose 0.5% to 35.20 on the stock market today. The stock has risen about 8% since July 5, at the start of its winning streak. Shares are 7% extended from a flat-base buy point of 32.85 touched on June 23.
"
473,QCOM,"SoftBank (SFTBY) acquisition ARM Holdings (ARMH) is expected late Wednesday to report Q2 sales and earnings that declined vs. last year's, ahead of Apple's (AAPL) iPhone 7 ramp and launch, widely expected in September.At the close on the stock market today, ARM stock was up a fraction to 66.20. SoftBank's U.S.-listed stock  gained 1.3% to 25.74.IBD'S TAKE: ARM stock ranks No. 1 in IBD's 41-company Electronic-Semiconductor Fabless industry group. The group is ranked No. 25 out of 197 groups tracked and has made big moves over the last month, climbing from No. 69. Get ARM's Stock Checkup here.ARM stock is up 46% for the year, flying 40.5% on July 18 after Japan's SoftBank announced its $32 billion plan to acquire it. The decision sparked mixed commentary, with some analysts wondering whether Intel (INTC) could have made a play for it.Others have questioned whether ARM will remain ""vendor neutral"" after its SoftBank merger. ARM designs chips for smartphones, smart cars, TV, servers and wearables. SoftBank's ownership could be concerning for customers like Apple, Broadcom (AVGO) and Qualcomm (QCOM), which are among the many licensees of ARM's designs.For Q2, ARM is expected to report $393.5 million in sales and 36 cents earnings per share ex items, up a respective 12% and 6% vs. last year, but with those growth rates slower than for the year-earlier period. Still, sales would approach the record $407.9 million notched in Q4.Sales are expected to decelerate again in Q3, but the consensus of seven analysts polled by Thomson Reuters models EPS speeding to double-digit growth vs. last year. That would come as Apple likely ramps its iPhone 7.At least seven analysts have downgraded ARM stock since the July 18 announcement of SoftBank's acquisition. The $32 billion price tag is about a 43% premium to ARM's closing price just prior to the announcement.
"
474,QCOM,"Shares of No. 1 chipmaker Intel (INTC) plunged Thursday, though into a potential buy zone, as its Q2 data center sales stagnated for the third consecutive quarter and its Internet of Things and memory sales toppled vs. Q1.Its PC chip sales only fell 3% quarter over quarter and year over year, which is broadly in line with industry trends. Industry tracker IDC this month said PC shipments fell 4.5% in Q2 vs. the year-earlier period, better than its 7.4% loss projection.In April, Intel announced a restructuring plan to cut out $1.4 billion in expenses over two years and a shift toward higher-growth data center, IoT and memory sales vs. its slowing PC unit. Disappointing Q2 sales in those target areas sent Intel stock down Thursday.IBD'S TAKE: Intel stock is ranked fourth in IBD's 38-company Electronic Semiconductor-Manufacturing industry group. The group has slipped to No. 103 out of 197 groups tracked, down from No. 80 last week. In general, only the top 30 groups should get most investor attention.On the stock market today, Intel fell 4% to 34.27, pulling back into buy range from a 32.85 entry point out of a bullish consolidation. On Wednesday, Intel stock touched an 18-month high.MKM analyst Ian Ing reiterated his buy rating on Intel stock and upped his price target to 40 from 39. He said the lack of commentary regarding Intel's likely Apple (AAPL) iPhone 7 win vs. Qualcomm (QCOM) and the likelihood of further PC declines sent the stock falling.For Q2, Intel reported $13.5 billion in sales, up 3%, and 59 cents earnings per share ex items, down 5%. Sales edged the consensus for $13.54 billion, but EPS topped by 6 cents. Q3 guidance for $14.9 billion in sales ex items, plus or minus $500 million, topped analysts' model by $300 million.During the quarter, data center sales decelerated to 5% growth after stalling at single-digit growth for the past two quarters. IoT sales fell 12% sequentially but grew 2% vs. last year. Non-volatile memory sales fell 1% vs. Q1, but they toppled 20% year over year.Intel's guidance calls for 10% sequential growth and a recovery in data center, IoT and memory sales in the second half of 2016, Needham analyst N. Quinn Bolton wrote in a research report. But PCs will likely still decline by high single digits over the year, Intel said.Still, Bolton is bullish on Intel stock, hinting at the chipmaker's potential iPhone win.""Memory pricing should improve, and a ramp in revenue should be seen from 3D Nand (flash memory) and 3D XPoint shipments,"" Bolton wrote. ""The ramp of the baseband for a major North American cellphone manufacturer for its new high-end phone will further aid revenue growth.""
"
475,QCOM,"Qualcomm (QCOM) stock zoomed to an eight-month high Thursday after the Apple (AAPL) iPhone supplier topped analysts' fiscal Q3 sales views in part on $400 million in catch-up royalty payments from Chinese mobile product makers.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Qualcomm stock finished the session up 7.4%, to 59.93. Shares are up 20% for the year vs. an 11% lift in IBD's 41-company Electronic Semiconductor-Fabless industry group, which is ranked No. 23 out of 197 groups tracked.IBD'S TAKE: Qualcomm has a middling Composite Rating of 47, meaning it underperforms about half of all stocks in terms of key metrics like earnings power. IBD's Electronic Semiconductor-Fabless industry group is led by ARM Holdings, which is pending sale to SoftBank.Analysts were mixed Thursday on whether Qualcomm can continue enforcing its licensing rules abroad. LG made $200 million in catch-up payments during fiscal Q3, but Qualcomm filed suit against Meizu for allegedly under-reporting its sales.Following an antitrust suit in 2013, Qualcomm has worked to re-sign Chinese OEMs under new licensing contracts. By under-reporting their sales, smartphone makers are stiffing Qualcomm on some of those licensing fees, the company says.William Blair analyst Anil Doradla fears a litigious approach could be expensive. But, without it, Qualcomm likely won't be able to force OEMs, which are struggling with mounting pricing pressures, to pay those fees.""The company's suit with Meizu is indicative of Chinese companies' continued unwillingness to conform to Qualcomm's licensing terms,"" he wrote in a research report, adding that resistance will likely extend to other geographies.But Canaccord analyst T. Michael Walkley expects Qualcomm to exit fiscal 2016 with 75% of Chinese OEMs paying fees. That will help Qualcomm reach 90% in global collections over a few years vs. 82% in fiscal 2015, he predicts.For fiscal Q3, Qualcomm reported $2.17 billion in licensing sales and $3.88 billion in chipset shipments, flat and up 9%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier quarter. Total sales of $6 billion topped the consensus for $5.58 billion.Qualcomm also reported $1.16 earnings per share ex items, topping analysts' view for 97 cents. Current-quarter guidance for $5.4 billion to $6.2 billion in sales and $1.05 to $1.15 EPS ex items beat analysts at the midpoint for $5.7 billion and $1.08.During fiscal Q3, chipset shipments of 201 million were down 11% year over year, but Qualcomm has seen strength in low-tier devices. Fiscal Q4 guidance likely reflects share loss to Intel in Apple's iPhone 7, Credit Suisse analyst Kulbinder Garcha wrote in a report.Garcha models a respective $15.2 billion and $15.8 billion in chipset shipments in fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017. He also sees $7.6 billion and $7.9 billion in licensing fees. Long term, licensing fees of $8 billion would be sustainable, he said.Canaccord's Walkley sees improved share for pricier Android smartphones helping Qualcomm offset potential share loss at Apple.""While we believe Intel (INTC) might win partial share for (modem chips in) the iPhone 7, we believe Qualcomm will maintain the majority of iPhone 7 units and is gaining share of mid- to high-end Android smartphones,"" he wrote in a report.Walkley boosted his price target on Qualcomm stock to 70 from 65 and kept his buy rating. Garcha has a buy rating on Qualcomm stock and lifted his price target to 70 from 67. Doradla maintained his market perform rating on shares.

477,QCOM,"Taiwan's Silicon Motion Technology (SIMO) has emerged as a strong leader in the fabless semiconductor design industry group.So, with a market cap of $1.9 billion, does the stock still have room to grow?Intuitively, it's easy to say yes. The largest stock in IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor fabless group, Qualcomm (QCOM), the darling tech of 1999 that topped just before the mighty 2000 Nasdaq tech crash, carries a value of more than $90 billion. That's in the big-cap leagues. Silicon Motion arguably would have to more than double in price just to be considered for midcap status.However, the savvy investor knows that no stock has the right to grow in size, especially in an age of sober exuberance as we may be witnessing in the U.S. stock market today. Every company must earn it.On the earnings front, Silicon Motion earns it. On an annual basis, profit has risen from 44 cents a share in 2010 to $2.11 in 2015. The company's EPS estimates look swell, up 55% to $3.26 a share in 2016, and up 17% to $3.83 in 2017.You can't have great earnings without great sales, and Silicon Motion earns it again. Revenue plummeted 20% in 2013, reflecting the highly cyclical nature of semiconductor companies. But they revved 28% higher in 2014, and 25% higher in 2015 to $361 million.Silicon Motion specializes in two niches: flash memory-based controllers for solid-state storage devices, and specialty radio-frequency (RF) integrated circuits for internet-enabled mobile devices. Given the growth of online video and mobile internet, Silicon Motion is definitely in a sweet spot.A company cannot grow in size without a few more factors. Ask yourself: Is a company attracting stronger demand from the institutional crowd? Certainly so for Silicon Motion. The stock's average volume is institutional quality at 571,000 shares on average a day, rising from 400,000 at the start of 2015. Plus, the fund sponsorship has recently eclipsed the 200-fund mark.Should you go out and buy shares, then metaphorically go to sleep for two to three years? No. A lot can happen over that time. Use chart analysis to determine the right entry point.For now, Silicon Motion is extended from a proper buy point. On March 11, the stock broke out and began its relatively smooth glide past a 34.10 entry within a three-month cup with handle in fast trading. That base was nestled within a much larger, deeper base that was first-stage. Why was it first-stage? The low of the deep base, 20.01, undercut the low of the prior cup that formed from September 2014 to January 2015.Over the next four months, it catapulted 64% in price to as high as 56.21. Now it's taking a pit stop. Watch for a new base to potentially form. Remember, it just takes a minimum five weeks to form a flat base and six to mold a cup.On Wednesday, Silicon Motion shares rose 0.3% in very quiet turnover to 54.31.IBD'S TAKE: Never heard of the flat base?

478,QCOM,"The iPhone SE helped Apple (AAPL) edge Wall Street's June-quarter smartphone unit sales projections, but shares of iPhone chip suppliers Broadcom (AVGO), Qualcomm (QCOM) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) lazed Wednesday.Analysts continue to have modest expectations for the iPhone 7, set to launch Sept. 16.Late Tuesday, Apple said it sold 40.4 million iPhones in its fiscal Q3, topping analyst models for 40 million but still declining 15% vs. the year-earlier period. Apple's revenue fell 23% to $24.05 billion. The company saw broad demand for the less-costly and smaller SE model.IBD'S TAKE: IBD's 41-company Electronic Semiconductor-Fabless industry group, which includes leaders like ARM Holdings, Nvidia and Monolithic Power Systems, ranks No. 21 out of 197 groups tracked. But the other chip group, the 39-company Electronic Semiconductor-Manufacturing industry group, is moving up. It ranks No. 70 and has climbed from No. 163 over the past eight weeks.FBN analyst Shebly Seyrafi models 46 million iPhones shipments in fiscal Q4, which would be roughly flat year over year. Revenue, though, would decline 16% on demand for the iPhone SE, he predicts.Canaccord analyst Matt Ramsay expects iPhone sales to be down year over year for the next couple quarters. For the September quarter, he models 44.4 million iPhones sold, but with improving average sales prices.Apple's fiscal Q4 guidance implies 44 million units, which tops the consensus for 43 million, Ramsay wrote in a research report. Fewer units sold would be bad news for Apple's slew of chip suppliers. Some, however, have said increasing content in the iPhone 7 could offset slower sales. Apple shares jumped 6.5% to 102.95 Wednesday.Qorvo (QRVO) stock rocketed as much as 7% in early trading before settling back to a 4.4% gain at the close to 63.01 on the stock market today. Shares are about 22% extended from a 52.05 entry point achieved July 6 out of a cup-with-handle base. Investors are typically advised to take some profits at 20%.Texas Instruments (TXN) stock edged down marginally to 71.27, but Tuesday it hit a 16-year high on strong Q2 growth tied to sales of automotive chips. Shares are about 17% extended from a 60.09 entry point hit June 28 out of a flat base.Broadcom shares climbed 1.4% to 165.66 at the close, flirting with a 166.10 entry point out of a cup-with-handle base. Earlier, shares rose as much as 3%. Qualcomm stock also was up a fraction. It reported consensus-topping fiscal Q3 sales last week.Skyworks stock jumped as much as 4% early Wednesday, but settled for a 0.9% gain to 66.47. That led to a fractional dip in shares of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) to 87.44. NXP stock has been forming a cup base over the last eight weeks.

479,QCOM,"Stock indexes remained mired near session lows Thursday afternoon as earnings news became the predominant factor in the the stock market today.The Nasdaq was down 0.4%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.5%. The Dow transports fared worse, down 1.3%.Volume was tracking higher across the board. That indicates that institutional investors took some profits, though there's been little evidence of that the past few weeks. Losers led winners by 3-to-2 on the NYSE and by 9-to-5 on the Nasdaq.Mellanox Technologies (MLNX) tumbled 9%, enough to trigger the 8% sell rule for those who bought at the 50.79 buy point. The chip designer reported a 16% rise in earnings, above views, but also a 3% dip in Infiniband sales amid pricing pressure from Intel (INTC).Intel itself gapped down more than 4% loss after the chipmaker reported Q2 results that left Wall Street with concerns. Shares undid about two weeks' worth of gains but held above the 32.85 buy point from its most recent base.Qualcomm (QCOM) rose sharply, up more than 7% to breach the 60 level, hitting the highest level since November, after the smartphone technology company beat sales and profit expectations. The stock this year has been recovering from a severe decline of nearly 50% from a peak two years ago. With Thursday's rally, the stock cleared resistance around 56.In the retail sector, Tractor Supply (TSCO) skidded 4% to a three-month low in heavy trading. The chain of farming, pet and ranch supply stores announced Q2 profit and sales in line with estimates. The stock undercut the lows of a base it has been forming, although it remains shallow enough to still be a proper flat base.In a day of few bullish moves, a metals stock stood out with a solid breakout. Insteel Industries (IIIN) shares soared more than 8% in heavy volume, sailing past the 31.93 buy point of a cup-with-handle base. The maker of reinforcing steel wire for concrete and construction jobs beat profit estimates. Despite flooding-related problems, the quarter's results benefited from both widening spreads between selling prices and raw material costs, as well as from an increase in shipments.

480,QCOM,"Minus upside surprises from the likes of Facebook (FB), Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL), the earnings picture would look a lot more grim.Tech is among the top sectors beating estimates for both sales and earnings per share in the most recent quarter, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Overall S&P 500 earnings are still in a downtrend, but the pace of decline is less than feared.The market is rewarding stocks like Apple, which is trading above 100 for the first time since late April. But fund investors aren't exactly piling in. Technology ETFs saw net outflow of $617 million in July -- a month that saw real estate exchange traded funds rake in $1.2 billion in fresh money, according to State Street Global Advisors.For Dave Mazza, head of research at State Street's SPDR ETFs, that's a telling sign of investor sentiment.""In an environment where growth is scarce, I would expect to see ETF investors walk into an area that's offering growth, but we're not seeing it,"" Mazza said. This earnings season came on the heels of the Brexit vote and in the middle of presidential conventions that drove investors' attention away from company fundamentals and more toward ""bigger-picture items,"" he noted.And the broad macroeconomic outlook is awash in uncertainties.""Volatility is here to stay as investors fret over the extended age of the current bull market, a lack of earnings growth, China, Europe, and perhaps most importantly, the most divisive U.S. presidential election in recent memory,"" State Street's recent 2016 Mid-Year ETF & Investment Outlook noted. Against that backdrop, the firm has some advice for ETF investors:Smart beta strategies are low-cost and offer broad market exposure, while zeroing in on ""factors"" -- or stock characteristics -- that can give portfolios an extra boost over time, according to State Street.PowerShares S&P 500 High Dividend Low Volatility (SPHD), iShares Edge MSCI Minimum Volatility USA (USMV) and SPDR MSCI Emerging Markets Quality Mix (QEMM) are ETFs that seek out promising factors for the current market scenario.SPHD looks for S&P 500 stocks showing low risk and high yield. It has jumped 20.4% year to date vs. a 7.1 gain for SPDR S&P 500 (SPY), a comparable ETF that gives you the broad U.S. market with no extra frills.Lindsey Bell, a senior analyst with S&P Global, says the industrial sector is -- against the odds -- leading Q2 earnings growth, with consumer discretionary. ""The aerospace and defense industry group dominates the upside surprises for industrials this quarter and even accounted for several guidance raises,"" Bell wrote on Wednesday. Boeing (BA) landed the biggest earnings beat in the group. Northrop Grumman (NOC), Lockheed Martin (LMT) and L-3 Communications (LLL) have bumped up outlook.IBD'S TAKE: To find out which exchange traded funds investing in sectors and industry groups are the current stock market leaders, check out ETF Center.Aerospace is a pocket of strength within industrials, according to Bell. ""We expect that to continue as the remainder of 2016 plays out and believe any improvement, no matter how small, in the economic environment will be a tailwind for the group into the future."" Three ETFs target this niche, including iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense (ITA).Health care is another sector with stronger-than-expected Q2 earnings growth, making it worthy of a spot on ETF watch lists.Chuck Self, CIO of iSectors, whose popular tactical ETF-based strategy invests across nine sectors, is impressed with the latest earnings beats by chipmakers Intel (INTC) and Qualcomm (QCOM). Self told IBD he's ""going back in"" to technology with iShares North American Tech (IGM). Self also likes tech multinationals -- as well as gold miners -- as a weak dollar play.SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) offers an efficient way to hold and trade the precious metal in a brokerage account.

That's a possible sign of profit-taking after the exchange traded fund hit a multiyear high of 62.24 the previous session.The ETF has outpaced peers investing in sector equities in the past five trading sessions, up nearly 5%. It has turned in a 9% gain in the month ended July 20 and a 17% gain year to date.""The main story behind the recent performance of SMH (is) earnings results that have beat expectations for a few top names,"" said Ed Lopez, head of ETF product management at VanEck. Besides Qualcomm, Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM), the No. 2 holding in SMH, beat estimates in its recent report.Chipmakers are showing strong momentum. Several leveraged and nonleveraged ETFs in this space, including iShares PHLX Semiconductor (SOXX), boast relative strength lines bolting to new highs.IBD'S TAKE: VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF is showing a nice uptrend, but the time may not be right to buy it for a tactical trade.

483,QCOM,"The stock market took a breather Thursday as earnings results continued to drive big moves in both directions ahead of reports from Chipotle (CMG), Starbucks (SBUX) and Visa (V). EBay (EBAY) soared, while Intel (INTC) sank during the regular trading session.The S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average shed 0.4% each; the Nasdaq gave up 0.3%. Volume was higher on the NYSE and Nasdaq vs. Wednesday, according to early figures.After the close, Starbucks fell 4% on a revenue miss. Chipotle missed earnings views, but shares were slightly higher in extended trading.Software, automakers and airlines led the downside during the regular session in the stock market today, while gold miners, medical and leisure stocks represented the upside.Construction machinery stocks also outperformed, as Joy Global (JOY) surged 20% in massive volume on a $3.7 billion acquisition by Japan's Komatsu (KMTUY).EBay gapped up and soared 11% to a new high, clearing a 29.93 buy point in fast turnover.

487,QCOM,"The concept of augmented reality has been around for years, but it took the wildly popular smartphone game ""Pokemon Go"" to bring it to the public's attention.The question now is whether ""Pokemon Go"" will spur AR to the next level, taking it beyond games and into practical applications.""'Pokemon Go' is hugely helpful in terms of awareness of AR among both consumers and the broader investment community,"" Tim Merel, founder and CEO of Eyetouch Reality and Digi-Capital, told IBD. ""It could have far-reaching repercussions beyond games, both in terms of what developers do next and where investors focus their attention.""""Pokemon Go"" will give augmented reality, aka mixed reality, a jump-start, Merel says.Augmented reality overlays digital information on what people see in the real world, where its cousin technology -- virtual reality -- completely blocks out the real world. In the case of ""Pokemon Go,"" people can see fantasy creatures called Pokemon on digital maps and through their smartphone camera -- (which they then capture and can use to battle other Pokemon to gain status, as it were.)But using smartphones for AR applications can cause problems. People have been injured playing ""Pokemon Go"" because they got distracted by having to look down at their smartphones while walking or driving around looking for Pokemon to capture.The next step for AR is to move applications to computerized glasses that project digital information into a wearer's field of view. Nintendo (NTDOY)-backed ""Pokemon Go"" has already been demonstrated on Microsoft's (MSFT) HoloLens and Vuzix (VUZI) smartglasses.Other major companies investing in augmented reality technology include Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL)-owned Google, Samsung, Facebook (FB) and Snapchat. Alphabet spinout Niantic is co-creator of ""Pokemon Go.""IBD'S TAKE: Facebook stock has been on a roll. Combining fundamental and technical analysis is the key to success, and in a volatile market looking for base hits instead of home runs is wise. That's the goal of IBD Swing Trader, where Facebook is among the very few stocks currently on this list.""'Pokemon Go' points out how exciting AR can be,"" Vuzix Chief Executive Paul Travers told IBD. ""That is the tip of an iceberg for how cool this stuff is going to get."" Vuzix makes wearable displays used with some AR products.Beyond games, applications for AR include navigation, such as pointing you to the closest ATM, and instruction, such as providing step-by-step visual prompts for making household repairs. And business enterprise applications also are getting closer.Experts say augmented reality glasses could be the fourth wave of personal computing, after PC, online and mobile.""When you can do the Pokemon stuff in a pair of fashion glasses, it's going to be the next computing platform,"" Travers said.AR headsets used in industrial applications today are too geeky for consumers to wear, he says. Remember the backlash when people started wearing Google Glass headsets in public?But people will be surprised how fast AR technology moves from bulky headsets to consumer products that look like regular sunglasses, Travers says.""For the mass market to embrace augmented reality in a wearable, the wearable itself can't look stupid,"" Travers said. ""You can't look like you're wearing an Oculus Rift (VR headset, from Facebook).""The killer app for consumer augmented-reality smartglasses likely will involve navigation, Travers said.AR glasses will show users directions by painting a virtual dotted line of the path to follow in front of them.""You won't go back to a handheld map when you can do that,"" Travers said.Investment dollars are flowing into development of augmented reality hardware and software.In the past 12 months, early-stage venture capital funds and corporations have invested $2 billion in AR and VR, Digi-Capital says. Unlike AR, virtual reality technology blocks out the real world and creates an entirely digital environment for users to experience.In February, augmented reality startup Magic Leap raised $793.5 million in a funding round that valued the company at $4.5 billion, far beyond the $1 billion milestone for so-called Unicorn startups. The funding round was led by China e-commerce leader Alibaba (BABA), with participation from existing investors Alphabet and Qualcomm (QCOM).Digi-Capital predicts that augmented reality will be a $90 billion market in 2020, including hardware, software and services. By comparison, it sees VR as a $30 billion market in 2020.While consumer applications for augmented reality, such as ""Pokemon Go,"" are now capturing the public's imagination, the real money is in commercial applications.One key commercial application for augmented reality is remote assistance, ABI Research says.In a remote assistance scenario, a technician wearing an AR headset can get help remotely from an expert who can see what the worker sees and walk them through a problem. The computerized glasses have a built-in camera, microphone and speakers so the worker and remote expert can work together. The remote expert can point and draw in an AR user's field of view to assist them.ABI Research on Thursday forecast augmented reality use in enterprises to explode over the next five years. It predicted shipments of AR smartglasses to hit 27 million units by 2021.""For 2016, initial tests and low-volume implementations will be expanded to higher volume investment and rollout, creating a more mature and disruptive marketplace for 2017,"" ABI analyst Eric Abbruzzese said in a statement. ""Devices with more powerful processing and hands-free input methods, such as ODG's R7 and Daqri's Smart Helmet, stand best suited for industrial and health care usage.""Nintendo's U.S. shares fell 10.55% to close at 29 on the stock market today, falling for a fourth straight session. But the stock is still up 63% since Pokemon Go launched.

Netflix topped profit views, but shares sank nearly 13% for the week.Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk unveiled his ambitious, long-term plans for the electric car company in combination with SolarCity (SCTY), which Tesla aims to acquire in a $2.8 billion offer. Plans include a new kind of pickup and minibus, as well as a compact SUV and a commercial truck. All of this as Tesla struggles to meet its production goals. The expansive report gave no indication about when Tesla will be consistently profitable. Tesla stock fell more than 3% on Thursday after the ""masterplan"" was released, but rose close to 1% for the week, holding above the 200-day line.Tesla will hold a ""grand opening"" event July 29 for its Gigafactory, though the Reno, Nev., battery plant is far from finished.IBD'S TAKE: Tesla stock is still trying to recover and the company has report several quarters of losses.

The deal occurred after the Brexit vote caused the British pound to tumble vs. the yen. SoftBank plans to expand ARM's overseas headcount over the next five years. But some analysts wonder: Can SoftBank maintain ARM's vendor-neutral approach?ARM shares have soared 40% so far this week. SoftBank fell nearly 11%. Sprint (S), majority-owned by SoftBank, slid 7.6%.Chipotle Mexican Grill's (CMG) Q2 EPS sank 80% to 87 cents, while revenue fell 17% to $998.4 million. Both missed views.

Domino's stock broke out to a new high, leaping 9.6%. Papa John's (PZZA) popped 6% as KeyBanc said pizza deliveries are faring well amid civil unrest.Starbucks (SBUX) disappointed with a Q3 revenue miss and in-line EPS, as adjusted profit grew 17% to 49 cents on 7% sales growth to $5.24 billion. But weaker-than-expected Americas comps were an ""anomaly,"" said CEO Howard Schultz. Starbucks rallied Friday to hit three-month highs. Dunkin' Brands (DNKN) turned in mixed results. Shares fell Thursday but rose 2.3% for the week.EBay (EBAY) gapped out of a base, spiking 16% for the week to a record high after reporting Q2 EPS growth of 2% to 43 cents, beating views by a penny.

Reports say Verizon (VZ) may announce a Yahoo buyout deal within a few days.Intel (INTC), Qualcomm (QCOM) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) reported mixed earnings. Intel's $13.5 billion and 59 cents earnings per share ex items for Q2 edged and topped the consensus, respectively. But Intel shares fell from an 18-month high on weaker-than-expected data center sales, though they closed the week down just 1.2%. Qualcomm reported $6 billion in sales and $1.16 EPS ex items for fiscal Q3, beating Wall Street expectations for a respective $5.58 billion and 97 cents. Qualcomm shares rose nearly 12% to a nine-month high.

Shares rose on the news though, as investors had priced in skepticism that the deals would win approval. Meanwhile, Humana raised its EPS guidance and said it will exit many ObamaCare exchange markets next year. UnitedHealth (UNH), the largest managed care firm, topped EPS views and said 2017 profit will improve from exiting nearly all exchanges.United Airlines (UAL) beat Q2 estimates and cut full-year carrying capacity growth, as international uncertainties weighed. The carrier also said it would reduce winter flights to the U.K. Delta Air Lines (DAL) said in the prior week that it would do the same following the nation's Brexit vote. Southwest (LUV) forecast a Q3 unit revenue decline, which would be its first this year. The carrier also missed Q2 estimates, and, like Spirit Airlines (SAVE), indicated that heavy lower-fare competition persists -- good for customers, but bad for airlines' financial results. American Airlines (AAL) reported a Q2 profit drop that wasn't as bad as expected. American also said the Brexit may help, not hurt, global carriers.The Q2 season kicked off with three solid reports from big-cap drugmakers. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) beat estimates and raised guidance, driven by the strength of its pharma division. Novartis (NVS) also beat Q2 estimates, but its stock fell as it warned of rising expenses related to new drug launches, and also said the FDA had rejected its biosimilar version of Amgen (AMGN) drug Neulasta.

GE and Honeywell shares fell Friday after hitting long-term highs earlier in the week.Lockheed Martin (LMT) raised its full-year outlook after reporting Q2 results above analyst estimates, but management warned it can't sustain its current level of F-35 spending unless the defense giant gets another production contract from the Pentagon soon. The attempted coup in Turkey isn't expected to weigh on the fighter's sales or production. Textron (TXT), maker of Cessna planes and Bell helicopters, reported a 10% jump in EPS, beating analyst expectations and revenue that climbed 8.1%, also above Wall Street views. It sees full-year EPS of $2.60 to $2.80. The midpoint is under analyst estimates for $2.72.Lockheed stock hit a record high during the week, closing the week up 0.1%. Textron rose 2.8%.

489,QCOM,"Qualcomm (QCOM) stock rocketed late Wednesday after the Apple (AAPL) chip supplier reported fiscal Q3 sales and earnings that crushed analysts' views, with the company citing ""meaningful progress with licensees in China."" Qualcomm current-quarter guidance also beat Wall Street views.CEO Steve Mollenkopf also noted growth in Qualcomm's chip set business with strong new product ramps, particularly with ""fast-growing OEMs in China."" He expressed confidence in Qualcomm's investments in 5G, the next advance in broadband beyond the current cutting-edge 4G, which he said should drive long-term earnings growth.In after-hours trading, Qualcomm stock lifted 7%, after the company's earnings announcement and after closing up 1.2% at 55.82 during the regular session. Shares are up 12% for the year after falling more than 30% in 2015.For its fiscal Q3 ended June 26, Qualcomm reported $6 billion in sales ex items and $1.16 earnings per share ex items, up a respective 3% and 17% vs. the year-earlier quarter. Both metrics easily topped the consensus of 33 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters for $5.58 billion and 97 cents.Current-quarter guidance for $5.4 billion to $6.2 billion in sales and $1.05 to $1.15 EPS ex items would be up 6% and 20%, respectively, vs. last year. At the midpoint, Qualcomm's sales and EPS guidance topped analysts' model for $5.7 billion and $1.08.Qualcomm stock has a middling IBD Composite Rating of 47, meaning it underperforms about half of all stocks in terms of earnings power and other key metrics. ARM Holdings (ARMH), Nvidia (NVDA) and Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR) lead in Qualcomm's chip industry group, each with a CR of 99.

491,QCOM,"SoftBank's (SFTBY) announcement late Sunday of its $32 billion deal to acquire Apple (AAPL) iPhone component supplier ARM Holdings (ARMH) could stoke further M&A activity, with top-five chipmakers -- Intel (INTC), Texas Instruments (TXN), NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), Qualcomm (QCOM) and Broadcom (AVGO) -- cited as potential acquirers.Any company with a $10 billion to $15 billion market capitalization is on the table, says S&P Global Market Intelligence analyst Angelo Zino. Companies valued around $5 billion are in the ""sweet spot."" Recent rumors have targeted Xilinx (XLNX), which is valued above $12 billion.Marvell Technology (MRVL), Cavium (CAVM), Cypress Semiconductor (CY), Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR) and Integrated Device Technology (IDTI) also fit the bill for possible acquisitions, Zino told IBD.Of IBD's 41-company Electronic Semiconductor-Fabless industry group, five names top $15 billion in market valuation: Qualcomm, Broadcom, ARM, Nvidia (NVDA) and NXP.At the close on the stock market today, ARM stock catapulted 40.6% to 66.17 and at an all-time high. That helped pull the IBD Electronic Semiconductor-Fabless industry group up 2%, hitting a 13-month high. Meanwhile, Apple gained 1.1% to 99.88. Qualcomm, which reports earnings later this week, also added 1.1%, and ended the day at 55.35. Broadcom advanced 0.7% to 162.33. Intel, which has struggled to enter the low-power microprocessor market dominated by ARM, ticked down 2 cents to 35.05.IBD'S TAKE: The Electronic Semiconductor-Fabless industry ranks No. 24 out of 197 groups tracked and includes leaders like Nvidia, the group's No. 1-ranked Monolithic Power Systems, Silicon Motion Technology, Broadcom and MaxLinear. All five have Composite Ratings of 99, meaning they perform in the top 1% of all stocks in key metrics such as earnings and sales growth.""Intel and Qualcomm are sitting on a hoard of cash, and both have concerns with regards to growth,"" Zino said. ""Broadcom, formerly Avago, has done a phenomenal job with acquisitions over the last three years. They're at a point now where they're looking to increase their war chest over the next 12 to 18 months.""Canaccord analyst Matt Ramsay puts Silicon Laboratories (SLAB), Cavium and GoPro (GPRO) supplier Ambarella (AMBA) on his potential takeover list, but says he doesn't see ARM as a target. U.K.-based ARM treats its licensees with a very ""vendor neutral approach"" and wasn't bandied on the typical rumor mill.""After last night's news, I wouldn't put anything (in M&A) past anybody,"" Ramsay told IBD. ""I don't think anything is off the table. Bigger companies buying differentiated tech is not off the table.""What's newer is companies doing more financial-engineering-type mergers, where it's a merger of equals to protect earnings growth and cash flow growth.""But 2016 M&A won't resemble the frenzy of 2015 chip-sector deals, when the value of M&As rocketed above $115 billion. In 2015, companies were buying innovation. Such was the case when Intel spent $16.7 billion to acquire field-programmable gate array (FPGA) maker Altera. This year, companies will be buying earnings leverage.""The semiconductor space has seen a dramatic slowdown in growth, and there's going to be a move by larger players to generate growth and earnings leverage via acquisitions,"" Ramsay said. ""You've got fairly healthy balance sheets across the sector here, and because of that, you're going to see more M&A.""Zino added: ""But in terms of dollar amount, you're not going to see what you saw in 2015 again.""Smartphone growth slowed to 10% in 2015 from 29% in 2014, Zino said. That's tugged at the bottom line for Apple iPhone suppliers like Qualcomm and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), which analysts expect to report a respective fifth and sixth quarter of decline later this week.This year, Zino expects smartphones to decelerate to 5%-6% growth. Canaccord's Ramsay is less bullish -- he views flat growth for 2016. For 2017, though, Apple's iPhone 8 ""super cycle"" could lend itself to 5% growth, Ramsay told IBD. And niche sectors like video, gaming and automotive will continue to growth.On the latter point, the annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in January used to be all about smartphones, but automotive and self-driving efforts by Apple, Alphabet (GOOGL) and Tesla Motors (TSLA) have pressed chipmakers into a new role, Ramsay says, noting, ""Now, there's a car in every booth.""

492,QCOM,"No. 1 fabless chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM) is expected to print a fifth consecutive quarter of declines when it reports June-quarter earnings after the close Wednesday, but the Apple (AAPL) supplier will hit the black again in September on the iPhone 7, analysts say.Qualcomm stock is up nearly 10% this year, outperforming IBD's 41-company Electronic Semiconductor-Fabless industry group which has gained 7.6%. Shares are forming a flat base, with a possible 56.37 buy point. Shares rose above their 50-day moving average on July 8 and remain above that key support line.IBD'S TAKE: Qualcomm, with an IBD Composite Rating of 43 and Relative Strength Rating of 44, is not a highly rated stock. But another fabless chipmaker, Broadcom, has a highest-possible CR of 99 and an RS of 81, and it might be worth more of your time because it also is among companies working on what look to be sound bases.For its fiscal Q3 ended June 26, Qualcomm is expected to report $5.58 billion in sales ex items and 97 cents earnings per share minus items, down 4% and 2%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier quarter, according to the consensus of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters.In March, Qualcomm guided to $5.2 billion to $6 billion in sales and 90 cents to $1 EPS minus items for the quarter. Both sales and EPS have declined by double digits, year over year, for the previous four quarters. But Qualcomm has topped views the past three periods.Fiscal Q4 ending Sept. 25 could signal a return to the black. For that quarter, Qualcomm is expected to report $5.74 billion in sales minus items and $1.09 EPS ex items, up a respective 5% and 20%.In a challenge for Qualcomm, Apple is rumored to have tapped Intel (INTC) to source some of its iPhone 7 modems. Qualcomm is the incumbent supplier and Intel hasn't supplied for an iPhone since the 3G iteration in 2008.Intel's IBD Composite Rating of 81 -- meaning it's performed in the top 20% of its group in earnings and sales growth, and other key metrics -- is stronger than Qualcomm's 43 CR.Qualcomm edged down 0.2% to 54.75 at the close on stock market today. Intel lost 0.4% to 35.07. Apple shaved a penny off its price to 98.78.
"
493,QCOM,"Apple (AAPL) supplier Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) is expected late Thursday to report a sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year declines in earnings. In its fiscal third-quarter report, Skyworks also is forecast to post sales that recovered minimally from the company's slowest-ever growth period.For fiscal Q3, the consensus of 24 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters models $750.2 million in sales, down 7% on a year-over-year basis vs. 2% growth in the prior quarter. But $1.21 earnings per share ex items would fall 10%.Skyworks' sales and EPS have both decelerated for five consecutive quarters. Like Apple's other chip suppliers, Skyworks was tugged down in April on Apple's first quarterly sales drop since 2003 and first-ever iPhone sales dip.Unlike fellow Apple supplier Qualcomm (QCOM) -- set to report its fiscal Q3 on Wednesday — analysts don't expect a Q4 recovery for Skyworks. Wall Street's model calls for a 6% decline in sales and a 7% decline in EPS in fiscal Q4.Skyworks rivals Broadcom (AVGO) and Qorvo (QRVO) in supplying radio-frequency chips for Apple's iPhones. But Broadcom recently gapped up with the $37 billion merger with the former Avago, and Qorvo is leading Skyworks in the carrier-aggregation battle, Citigroup recently said.IBD's TAKE: Skyworks stock has a middling IBD Composite Rating of 54, meaning it underperforms nearly half of its rivals. But rival Broadcom boasts a top-ranking CR of 99 and its Electronics Semiconductor-Fabless industry group is No. 23 out of 197 groups tracked. Take a look at Broadcom's stock checkup.Both are more diversified than Skyworks, Citigroup says. About 80% of Skyworks' total revenue is tied to smartphone sales. On a global basis, smartphones are experiencing a decline as Apple struggles to beat its own records and China nears saturation.Year-to-date, Skyworks stock is down 15% vs. IBD's 38-company Electronic Semiconductor-Manufacturing industry group, which is up 2% for the year.

494,QCOM,"Federal regulators forged ahead Thursday in making high-frequency radio spectrum available for 5G wireless services, with about a third of the airwaves to be auctioned off and the rest to be shared.Verizon Communications (VZ) and AT&T (T) have lobbied for the high-frequency spectrum, along with tech firms such as Qualcomm (QCOM) and Intel (INTC). AT&T, in a statement, lauded the Federal Communications Commission for opening up a broad swath of spectrum above 24 GHz for 5G services.""The mmWave spectrum bands authorized today will serve as the launchpad for 5G development and deployment in the U.S.,"" said Joan Marsh, AT&T VP of federal regulatory, in a statement.Verizon and AT&T have touted plans to offer 5G wireless broadband services to residential homes, in a challenge to cable TV firms.Comcast (CMCSA), though, recently noted on an earnings call that high-frequency airwaves are prone to interference.IBD's TAKE: Verizon is among some big S&P 500 stocks that have been in buy range.Verizon, in a policy blog released Thursday, said: ""The FCC Order puts the U.S. on track to become the first country in the world to open up wide swaths of high-band spectrum, which is critical to ensure that the U.S. retains its global leadership in advanced wireless communications. 5G promises to have a transformative impact on communications, but it will also power the internet of Things and revolutionize other industries.""AT&T stock ended trading up fractionally to 42.77 on the stock market today, while Verizon stock edged down to 55.84.
"
495,QCOM,"Cirrus Logic (CRUS) content in the iPhone 8 -- expected to go on sale in fall 2017 -- will nearly double vs. last year's iPhone 6S iteration, assuming Apple (AAPL) nixes the 3.5-millimeter headphone jack, Canaccord analyst Matthew Ramsay said Tuesday.Ramsay outlined Cirrus Logic's jump from $3.50 in content in the iPhone 6S, which was released last fall, to $6.50 in chips powering the 10th anniversary iPhone 8. The iPhone 8 will likely see stronger sales than the iPhone 7, expected to be released in September, Ramsay says. He rates Cirrus Logic stock a buy, with a 52 price target.In afternoon trading on the stock market today, Cirrus Logic stock was up 2% to 39.34. The stock has been in a buy zone for three days, from a 38.24 entry point initially topped on June 20, when it broke out of a cup-with-handle base.Cirrus Logic will outplay Apple's iPhone unit decline and the global smartphone slowdown, and potentially displace Qualcomm (QCOM) in some low- and mid-tier phones, Ramsay predicted.It's widely assumed Apple will eliminate the headphone jack in the iPhone 7, leaving room for an external speaker and a 50-cent amplifier by Cirrus Logic, Ramsay wrote in a research report. This opens Cirrus Logic's digital and noise-canceling headphone opportunity.Ramsay models $4-$5 Cirrus Logic content in the iPhone 7. If noise-canceling headphones are adopted in the iPhone 8 -- broadly speculated to be a massive iPhone overhaul -- Cirrus Logic could boost its dollar content to $6.50.As Android scrambles to match Apple's pace, Ramsay sees Cirrus Logic expanding further into that market where it only has 25% and 5% share in premium and low- to mid-tier smartphones, respectively. Qualcomm's audio chips have a solid share in those markets.""Even modest share gains could yield material upside to our estimates, given the 1.1 billion-plus Android unit total addressable market,"" Ramsay said. Growing to 30% of premium phones and 15% of the lower tiers could yield $4.16 earnings per share ex items in 2018, he says.Other drivers include Cirrus Logic's emerging MEMS (micro-electro-mechanical systems) microphone franchise and audio opportunities in the Internet of Things. Ramsay lowered his 2016 EPS minus items view to $2.84, but he boosted his 2017 model to $3.73.In related news, fellow Apple supplier Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) sustained a pair of downgrades Tuesday. Nomura downgraded TSM to neutral from buy, and JPMorgan downgraded it to neutral from overweight.Taiwan Semi shares fell 0.85% to 26.97. Quacomm climbed 0.9% to 54.62. Apple rose 0.45% to 97.42.
"
496,QCOM,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) crushed analysts' Q2 expectations and Q3 outlook early Thursday, guiding to more than $1 billion year-over-year growth amid Apple's (AAPL) iPhone 7 ramp, with the smartphone expected to be released in September.CFO Lora Ho credited Taiwan Semiconductor's Q2 performance to increases in mid- and low-end smartphone segments, and hinted at Apple's upcoming iPhone 7 release. TSM is widely rumored to be the sole producer of Apple's upcoming A10 processor.""We expect our business in the third quarter will benefit from new product launches by major mobile device customers, as well as continued inventory restocking by our customers,"" Ho said in a statement.TSM's U.S. stock rose 0.8% to 27.11 on the stock market today, in a buy zone from a 26.68 entry point out of a cup-with-handle base. Shares are up 19% this year, and the stock has a good-but-not-great IBD Relative Price Strength Rating of 80, putting it among the top 20% of all stocks in performance over the past 12 months.Shares of fellow Apple suppliers Qorvo (QRVO), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Broadcom (AVGO) lifted Thursday, up nearly 4%, more than 3% and about 2%, respectively. Qualcomm (QCOM), another Apple chip supplier, is set to report earnings next Wednesday, and Skyworks' result are due next Thursday, July 21. No. 1 chipmaker Intel (INTC) also is slated to report its Q2 earnings on Wednesday.IBD'S TAKE: Taiwan Semiconductor isn't the only chipmaker to rebound on its supposed tie to Apple's iPhone. Intel and Cirrus Logic have become the subjects of recent speculation. Intel is now 6% extended from a flat-base entry point at 37.85. Cirrus Logic is 3% extended from a cup-with-handle base and 38.24 entry point.For Q2, TSM reported $6.84 billion in sales and 43 cents earnings per American Depositary Receipt ex items, topping the consensus of analysts polled by FactSet for $6.79 billion and 41 cents. Three months ago, TSM guided revenue to about $6.65 billion to $6.75 billion.On a year-over-year basis, sales rose 3% and EPS dipped 9%. Excluding non-recurring gains in the year-earlier period, Taiwan Semiconductor's EPS would have grown by 17%, the company said.Current-quarter sales guidance for 254 billion to 257 billion Taiwan dollars (about $7.86 billion to $7.95 billion) would be up 18% from $6.67 billion in the year-earlier quarter at the midpoint. That would be TSM's biggest gain in six quarters. Analysts had modeled $7.75 billion.TSM doesn't provide EPS guidance, but analysts polled by FactSet see 55 cents, up 20% from Q3 2015.
"
497,QCOM,"No. 1 chipmaker Intel (INTC) could supply more than half of the Apple (AAPL) iPhone 7 modems, on its way to possibly entirely ousting incumbent Qualcomm (QCOM) from the Apple supply chain, Cowen analyst Timothy Arcuri said Monday.Intel shares rose 1.1% to 34.38 on the stock market today. They have recovered 12% since June 27, when Intel stock hit a sell zone. On Wednesday, the shares moved back into a buy zone first reached June 23, when Intel stock broke out of a cup-with-handle base at a 32.79 buy point.Arcuri boosted his price target Monday on Intel stock to 36 from 32 and kept his market perform rating. He expects Intel's Apple business to add 17 cents earnings per share ex items on $1.5 billion in incremental revenue over 2016 and 2017.Qualcomm stock fell 0.1% to 54.12. It has a potential buy point of 56.37, out of a flat base.Earlier, Arcuri had seen Intel seizing just 25% of the iPhone 7 modem business. On Friday, RBC analyst Amit Daryanani speculated Intel would supply a third. Now, Arcuri expects Intel to take more than half of Apple's iPhone 7 modem business.Cost is a factor. Intel's four-chip modem product costs about $7.50 to make, meaning Intel can sell it for $15 and still garner 50%-55% gross profit margins, Arcuri says. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) looks likely to make the bulk of these phones. Qualcomm's modem product for iPhones runs about $17 to buy, Arcuri says.Apple is diversifying its supply chain, and that doesn't look good for Qualcomm in the long term, Arcuri wrote in a research report.""Intel could, over time, allow Apple to integrate Intel's modem technology together with Apple's application processor and eventually use Intel's foundry to make the chip and cut Qualcomm out entirely,"" he wrote.Getting back into the iPhone allows Intel another chance to justify its long-suffering mobile unit. Intel is largely known as the prime PC supplier and hasn't had any chips inside an iPhone since the 3G iteration.""The psychological effect (of getting into Apple) for Intel is event greater as it opens up an entirely new non-(PC) narrative,"" Arcuri wrote.Apple stock rose 0.3% to 96.98. Taiwan Semiconductor, which reported June sales rose 36% in local currency, advanced 1.8%.
"
498,QCOM,"Chip supplier Qualcomm (QCOM) posted better than expected fiscal second-quarter earnings after the market close Wednesday, but its EPS guidance lagged estimates, and shares were down nearly 3% in after-hours trading.Qualcomm reported revenue of $5.6 billion for the quarter that ended March 27, down 19% from the year-earlier quarter but beating the consensus estimate of $5.34 billion.Earnings per share minus items fell 26% to 1.04, but that number topped the 96-cent consensus estimate of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters.For its fiscal third quarter, Qualcomm guided to sales of $5.2 billion to $6 billion; the midpoint, $5.6 billion, was down 4% from the year-earlier quarter, but it was slightly ahead of the analyst consensus estimate of $5.56 billion for the quarter that ended March 27.Still, Qualcomm projected Q3 EPS in the range of 90 cents to $1.00, vs. 99 cents last Q3 and below the consensus of $1.02.Qualcomm CEO Steve Mollenkopf pointed to the quarter’s bright spots.“We delivered a stronger-than-expected quarter as we continue to execute our strategy for the next phase of growth,” Mollenkopf said in the company’s earnings conference call. “2016 is a transition year for Qualcomm, and we are making good progress.”He said that progress includes in its licensing business, but he said that stronger than expected performance across all of Qualcomm’s chipset and licensing businesses drove the Q2 beat.Tough contract negotiations have stunted Qualcomm’s licensing revenue growth, along with a royalty dispute with South Korea-based LG. Last year, there were a number of lawsuits globally related to Qualcomm’s licensing business. Investors are also concerned about the under-reporting of device sales among China vendors. The completion of new licensing deals has helped to alleviate those concerns.With its earnings results, Qualcomm announced that it had resolved a licensing dispute with LG “through good faith negotiations” that provides LG access to Qualcomm’s broad portfolio of patented technologies.“We are continuing to build momentum into the second half of our fiscal 2016 with traction for our Snapdragon processors in the premium and high tiers and strong execution of our strategic realignment plan,” Mollenkopf said.The Snapdragon chips are in such phones as Samsung’s new Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge.As part of its transition, Qualcomm has focused on a $1.4 billion cost reduction plan, boosting cash flow and profit, bolstering research and development, positioning for industry growth and making China licensing a top priority, among other steps. The company says that it's on track to realize at least $700 million in savings in fiscal 2016, an increase of $100 million from its original estimate.Mollenkopf said that Qualcomm has more than 100 licensing deals with companies in China and is in active discussions with others.The company has made notable progress signing China license agreements, Michael McConnell, an analyst with Pacific Crest Securities, said in a research note prior to the earnings report. It's inked four of the top five China smartphone makers, led by Lenovo, to new license agreements, he wrote.Qualcomm said that its MSM (Mobile Station Modem) chip shipments reached 189 million, down 19% year over year but above the midpoint of its guidance range. For Q3, it expects MSM shipments of about 175 million to 195 million units, down 13% to 22%. Its MSM chipsets target higher-end smartphones.Sales of cellphones based on Qualcomm chips totaled $70.1 billion, down 8% but above the midpoint of the company's guidance.Qualcomm ended the year with $30 billion in cash and equivalents.In fiscal Q2, Qualcomm's chip technology unit, called QCT, reported revenue of $3.3 billion, down 25% year over year. Its licensing unit, QTL, reported revenue of $2.1 billion, down 12%.Mollenkopf said that growth markets for Qualcomm include automotive, wearable devices and the Internet of Things. 
"
499,QCOM,"Apple's (AAPL) iPhone shortfall could draw InvenSense (INVN) into the tornado late Monday when the sensor-chipmaker is expected to report its first-ever sales decline and its biggest earnings fall to date.InvenSense stock toppled 5.5% to 7, falling the most of IBD's 41-company Electronic Semiconductor-Fabless industry group which was up a fraction on the stock market today.Fellow Apple suppliers Broadcom (AVGO) and Qualcomm (QCOM) stocks rose 1.2% and 0.1%, respectively, vs. flat shares of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) and Cirrus Logic (CRUS). InvenSense follows radio-frequency supplier Qorvo (QRVO), which reported earnings last Wednesday.The consensus of 13 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters models $79.9 million in sales and 2 cents earnings per share ex items for InvenSense's fiscal Q4. On a year-over-year basis, sales and EPS would be down 20% and 83%, respectively.It would be InvenSense's fifth straight quarter of decelerating sales growth, and the first time the Apple supplier has seen sales fall vs. the year-earlier quarter. Earnings fell 14% last quarter.Three months ago, InvenSense guided to $77 million to $83 million in sales and 0-2 cents EPS ex items.During the January conference call, CFO Mark Dentinger noted a step-down at ""the North American customer"" -- widely assumed to be Apple -- and lighter sales in Korea. He expected Internet of Things sales to help fill those holes.On April 26, Apple reported its first-ever year-over-year iPhone sales decline and its first revenue drop since 2003. Teardowns show InvenSense supplies a gyroscope/accelerometer combination chip for the iPhone 6S.But InvenSense is forecast for 13% sales and 2% EPS growth in fiscal 2016 to $420.9 million and 47 cents, respectively, on healthier metrics earlier in the year.Apple shares rose 1% intraday after hitting a 2-year low on Friday.
"
500,QCOM,"Tesla Motors (TSLA) partner Nvidia (NVDA) and Samsung called a cease-fire Monday on a nearly two-year battle over their mobile tech patents, the companies said in a joint statement hours before a decision was due in Samsung's suit against Nvidia.Under the settlement, Nvidia and Samsung will license ""a small number of patents by each company to each other,"" but won't allow for ""broad cross-licensing of patents or other compensation,"" they said.Nvidia fired the first shot in late 2014, claiming Samsung and Apple (AAPL) supplier Qualcomm (QCOM) had violated its patents on graphics processing chips. Samsung retaliated with a lawsuit that alleged Nvidia had violated its patents.Both sought to have some rival components banned from sale in the U.S. In December, a judge upheld an earlier ruling that Samsung and Qualcomm had not violated Nvidia's patents. Monday's decision would have wrapped Samsung's case.In afternoon trading on the stock market today, Nvidia stock was up more than 1%, near 36. Shares are on a nearly three-month run, up 42% since a Feb. 11 bottom this year, likely helped along by the release of the Facebook (FB) Oculus Rift virtual-reality headset.The Oculus recommends use of devices that have graphics chips -- graphics processing units -- from Nvidia or Advanced Micro Devices (AMD).
"
501,QCOM,"Sony (SNE) PlayStation 4 chip supplier Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR) topped Wall Street's Q1 expectations after the close Monday and issued current-quarter sales guidance that beat the consensus at the midpoint.Monolithic Power stock rose 1.75% in Monday's regular session to 63.51, and was flat in after-hours trading. Shares are even for the year, but have recovered from an 8% dip through mid-February. Monolithic stock broke out of a cup-with-handle based last month at 65.36, so it's down nearly 3% from the buy point.For Q1, Monolithic Power reported $84.5 million in sales and 45 cents earnings per share minus items, up 15% and 22%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier quarter.IBD Take: Monolithic Power gets great ratings of late, as you can see from IBD Stock Checkup.Both measures topped the consensus of eight analysts polled by Thomson Reuters for $83 million and 44 cents per share, and the midpoint of Monolithic Power's earlier sales view for $81 million to $85 million.Current-quarter sales guidance for $91 million to $95 million would be up 12%-17% and beat analysts' model for $91.5 million at the midpoint.Monolithic Power stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 97, out of a best-possible 99, trailing Nvidia (NVDA), Silicon Motion Tech (SIMO) and Maxlinear (MXL). Its chips are used in Sony's PlayStation 4, Microsoft (MSFT) Xbox One and Blu-ray/DVD players.It competes against tech majors like Intel (INTC), Texas Instruments (TXN) and Qualcomm (QCOM), all Apple (AAPL) suppliers.
"
502,QCOM,"Verizon Communications (VZ) and chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM) have been pushing 5G wireless technologies that could start rolling out as soon as next year and could greatly increase wireless speeds and give the internet of Things a big boost, but look out for China in the global standards-setting process, says a Bernstein Research report.The Federal Communications Commission at its meeting Thursday is expected to move ahead with a proposal to use high-frequency airwaves for 5G services. The FCC proposal could give Verizon and AT&T (T) a lift in testing 5G technology for residential broadband services.Verizon on Monday said it had finalized its 5G radio specifications. Qualcomm, meanwhile, has been demonstrating 5G technologies for a wide range of applications.Bernstein Research, however, says that China aims to play a key role in 5G standards, where of course it will important to have global compatibility. But China is less focused on residential broadband than is AT&T and Verizon. Chinese network equipment makers, led by Huawei, aim to become 5G exporters.A big question is whether 5G wireless networks will replace 4G networks or coexist, targeting web-connected cars, home broadband and other markets.""China has a strong vested interest in insuring a significant amount of Chinese technology is embedded in the 5G standard -- finally freeing them of their dependency on foreign technology and the need to pay royalties,"" said the Bernstein Research report. ""Their vision of 5G is the most revolutionary; China Mobile's chief scientist of wireless technologies is calling to 'rethink the fundamentals' of mobile technology.""China Mobile (CHL) is the country's biggest wireless service provider.Verizon says it will begin rolling out 5G commercially in 2017, though its plans are still vague. Many wireless service providers touted 5G plans and tests at the Mobile World Congress in February.While 5G is expected to provide much faster data speeds, wireless firms also expect applications that require always-on, low-data-rate connections. The apps involve data-gathering from industrial sensors, home appliances and other devices, part of what's often referred to as the internet of Things.""5G standardization will happen in a more concentrated industry than 3G or 4G,"" said the Bernstein Research report. ""Ericsson, Nokia and Huawei will be the main contributors for network. Qualcomm is likely to continue to lead in chip design, and there is a very restricted pool of operators that can take a leadership: China Mobile, (Japan's) NTT DoCoMo, AT&T, Verizon, and maybe Vodafone (VOD) and Deutsche Telekom (DTEGY).""Verizon fell 0.8% and AT&T 0.2% in the stock market today, but both have been strong of late as high-dividend-paying stocks have provided a safe haven at a time of low interest rates worldwide and a shaky stock market. On July 5, Verizon stock hit a 16-year high and AT&T stock touched a nearly 15-year high. Verizon remains in buy range while AT&T is extended.But with investors taking on more risk, telecoms may have less appeal.
"
503,QCOM,"No. 1 chipmaker Intel (INTC) will breeze through the PC doldrums thanks to Apple's (AAPL) iPhone 7, but rival Advanced Micro Devices' (AMD) three quarters of better-than-expected sales will likely ""crack,"" forcing shares to tumble from four-year highs, analysts said Friday.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Intel shares ended the day up 2.4% to 34, while Advanced Micro Devices stock was up 1.6%, to 5.10. The companies are set to report Q2 earnings on July 20 and July 21, respectively.Intel stock broke out a flat base at a 32.79 buy point on June 23, so it remains within buy range.RBC analyst Amit Daryanani upped his price target on Intel stock to 34 from 33, noting that slightly stronger PC demand and tailwind from Apple's iPhone 7 ramp should provide upside to Intel's fiscal Q2 client computing group (CCG) sales.Intel reportedly will supply a third of Apple's iPhone 7 modems, partially replacing incumbent Qualcomm (QCOM). That could add $300 million to $500 million in incremental sales in the second half of 2016, Daryanani wrote.That will partially offset an expected 7% decline in PC sales in 2016. Intel is the longtime leader in sales of computer microprocessors. It's had a hard time cracking the mobile market, however, so the iPhone 7 win could be big for the company.Daryanani models $30.2 billion in 2016 CCG sales, declining 6.3% but topping a 7.6% fall in 2015. He said Intel's view for accelerating data center sales is likely ""aggressive.""Still, there's near-term strength in PCs. On Thursday, Western Digital (WDC) upped its fiscal Q4 guidance following its acquisition of SanDisk.Notebook shipments climbed 28% month over month to 9.2 million units in May, according to device makers, Daryanani wrote.Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon is less bullish on Intel stock, but boosted his price target to 33 from 26 and upgraded shares to market perform from underperform. He downgraded AMD stock to underperform from market perform and kept his 3 price target.Like Daryanani, Rasgon sees Apple-centric sales boosting Intel's near-term revenue. For Q2, he models $13.6 billion in total sales vs. Wall Street consensus views for $13.5 billion. His Q3 model for $14.6 billion in total sales is largely in line with broader expectations.AMD, on the other hand, is ""more controversial,"" he wrote in a research report. After AMD's Q1 upside surprise, shares rocketed on hopes that share gains vs. Tesla Motors (TSLA) partner Nvidia (NVDA) can hold, that new products might sustain upside and that IP deals may follow.Those hopes are unfounded, Rasgon says. AMD's Q1 upside was likely on channel fill and its semi-custom win was on a console. Also, AMD's Zen product likely won't ramp materially in servers for a year, he says.He wrote that ""we suspect downside over the next few quarters is likely, and when it cracks it tends to do it rapidly.""

504,QCOM,"In January 2005, Larry Summers made a comment about women during a speech that was a gross generalization. It was also grossly erroneous.Now, we are talking about a highly accomplished individual. Summers served as U.S. Treasury Secretary during the Bill Clinton presidential years. He became an economics professor at age 28 and has written 150 scholarly papers. He advised President Obama on what to do about the biggest banks and the auto industry during the Wall Street subprime debt meltdown of 2008.However, Summers' comment at a National Bureau of Economic Research luncheon -- that innate differences between men and women may explain the relatively low number of women scholars in the physical sciences -- raised a lot of hoopla in academic circles and at Harvard University, where at the time Summers was serving as president. The Harvard Crimson reported that MIT biologist Nancy Hopkins ""felt physically ill"" after hearing Summers' remarks.Some believe the controversy ultimately cost Summers his job.What does this anecdote have to do with the art and science of stock investing?If you want to be a great stock picker and an equally great stock seller, then it matters practically zilch whether you are a man or woman. The market is blind to your sex.What factors matter far more? They include your knowledge about the market and the companies in which you invest; your level of discipline in following sound rules; your strength of conviction when it matters most; and your ability to control your emotions. Being male or female does not give you an advantage or disadvantage in any of these factors.Such a statement may seem a minority view.Go on your computer, iPad or smartphone and type in, ""Are women investors better than men?"" Google will list a stream of stories that argue such a case. In December last year, AARP's website began one article in this way: ""Overall, women are better investors than men.""The reason? The writer cited research from professors at the University of California-Berkeley who concluded, after a study of stock trading patterns between the sexes, that men trade 45% more than women. The scholars argued that since frequent trading eats away at returns, women thus performed a full percentage point better than men.Excuse me?When it comes to mastering IBD's CAN SLIM investment system, frequent buys and sells are a part of the process. No one will perfectly pick the next Home Depot (HD) (up 1,835% from its Oct. 20, 1981, breakout to a peak in September 1983), Wal-Mart (WMT) (giant market winner from the late 1970s to 1990s), L Brands (LB) (formerly The Limited, one of the biggest stock market winners in the women's apparel industry), Microsoft (MSFT), Cisco Systems (CSCO), Qualcomm (QCOM) or Apple (AAPL) in every single trade.In a field of 10,000 stocks trading each day, the mathematical odds are simply too low.Good trading is certainly an act of research and preparation before you buy any security. But the search for great stocks also carries a big element of trial and error.Speaking of errors, do you think the founder and chairman of Investor's Business Daily, William O'Neil, ever made bum stock trades? Of course. Not every stock O'Neil touched turned into gold. But O'Neil's greatness in the stock market came not only in the ability to find and clarify the elements of great stocks at the start of their huge price runs (what CAN SLIM is all about). As associates who have worked closely with O'Neil will tell you, he also succeeded by quickly recognizing his errors of market judgment and keeping losses in many stocks very small.Over the years, women have made strides in the field of equity research and portfolio management. You can read about their adventures on Wall Street via books such as ""Tiger Woman on Wall Street"" by Junheng Li. Meredith Whitney became famous for making a bearish call on Citigroup (C) in late 2007, saying the big bank will be forced to suspend its dividend (she was right). Whitney later left Oppenheimer as a research analyst and started a hedge fund. But in 2015, she was forced to close Kenbelle Capital LP due to poor results and an exit by its largest investor, according to a June 11, 2015, Wall Street Journal article.To be fair, innumerable men have had far more spectacular failures as fund managers. John Meriwether's Long-Term Capital Management, which included two Nobel Prize winners, blew up big time in the fall of 1998. The point: Being a woman doesn't provide you immunity from a stock market that is going the opposite direction of what you think or feel. Everyone must respect the market.""I will never give myself the luxury of thinking: I've made it,"" Zaha Hadid, the designer of the aquatics center at the 2012 London Olympics and other grand projects who died in March in Miami, once said. Although the star Iraqi-American architect wasn't likely talking about stock investing, such an attitude is valuable in the market.The stock market doesn't know who you are. It cannot know whether you're male or female. Nor will it ever care.

505,QCOM,"Apple (AAPL) and Huawei will take share from Samsung and Xiaomi within the Chinese smartphone market, leading to mass volatility and an inventory work-down for chipmakers like Broadcom (AVGO), Qorvo (QRVO) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), an MKM analyst predicted Wednesday.Shares of Broadcom, Qorvo and Skyworks were up a fraction each in early afternoon trading on the stock market today, while Apple stock was down a fraction. Last month, Apple reported March-quarter sales that missed views for the first time since 2003, undercutting chip stocks, which have broadly fallen since.The Apple report bolsters concerns of a smartphone slowdown, fresh off worries that Chinese smartphone saturation would stunt further growth. But, MKM analyst Ian Ing notes, the brimming Chinese market is still buying.Of 1,000 Chinese respondents in an MKM survey, more than 60% plan to buy a new smartphone within the next three to six months vs. less than 25% of U.S. respondents, Ing wrote in a research report. Of those in China, 38% plan to switch brands.""Chinese consumers are even more gadget-friendly relative to U.S. consumers,"" Ing wrote. ""Ownership is higher across smartphones, PCs and tablets in rank order.""Nearly 97% of Chinese consumers own a smartphone vs. 84% of Americans, but 25% of Chinese respondents plan to add another smartphone account -- likely expanding to children and the elderly -- vs. only 7.5% of Americans, Ing wrote, suggesting that Chinese users refresh their smartphones annually.Advances in wireless charging and fingerprint sensing will drive further adoption, he wrote.In smartphones, Apple, Huawei and LeTV look likely to take share from Xiaomi, Samsung and Lenovo, Ing wrote. Chinese consumers are more driven by brand (68% vs. 43% of Americans) and less by cost (33% vs. 61% of Americans).Those dramatic swings in share could affect chipmakers like Qorvo and Skyworks, which are 32% and 20% exposed to China, respectively. Ing estimates 40% of Qorvo's mobile sales stem from China. Fellow Apple suppliers Qualcomm (QCOM) and Broadcom are less exposed -- mid-teens and less than 10%, respectively, Ing said.""That said, Qorvo is favorably exposed to Huawei as a 10% customer,"" he noted.

S&P 500 futures are 7 points higher, and Nasdaq 100 futures are up about 25 points. On Tuesday, the Dow rose 0.1%, while the S&P 500 dipped 0.1%, and the Nasdaq composite lost 0.4%.Microsoft rose 4.5% in premarket trading to about 55.50. Late Tuesday, Microsoft reported surprise increases in adjusted earnings per share, with its Azure cloud business doubling over the past year.Microsoft shares are building the right of a consolidation that goes back to the end of last year. Its stock has a potential buy point at 56.87.Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) climbed nearly 7% to 718. Intuitive Surgical, maker of the da Vinci robotic surgical systems, reported a 23% EPS gain and a 14% revenue rise late Tuesday.Intuitive Surgical shares have been in buy range since clearing a 654.98 entry point from a flat base in late June. But the stock looks set to be extended after Wednesday's open.IBD'S TAKE: Should you buy a stock before earnings? You could enjoy big gains -- or big losses. Here are strategies to limit your downside risk.IBD 50 stock New Oriental Education (EDU) fell 4% to about 40. New Oriental Education, a for-profit Chinese private language and test prep provider, reported Wednesday morning Q4 profit of 29 cents a share, a penny above Wall Street views. Revenue rose 20% to $394.9 million, slightly above views for the $389.7 million. But it gave weak Q1 revenue guidance.New Oriental has formed flat base with a 43.68 buy point, but it appeared likely to fall below its 50-day moving average at the open.Meanwhile, social networking giant Facebook rose 0.6% to 121.33. That's above a 121.18 buy point in a flat base pattern. But Facebook's chart is not without flaws. Facebook reports earnings on July 27.After the market close, Intel (INTC), Qualcomm (QCOM), F5 Networks (FFIV) are among the companies reporting earnings.

507,QCOM,"SoftBank's (SFTBY) $32 billion deal for Apple (AAPL) supplier ARM Holdings (ARMH) picked up mixed commentary Tuesday, with Jefferies analyst Atul Goyal lamenting SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son's plan to work on ""more crazy ideas.""Meanwhile, Semiconductors Advisers President Robert Maire was surprised Intel (INTC) hadn't bid on ARM to buy its way into the mobile market. IHS analyst Tom Hackenberg expects SoftBank, via ARM, to rival Tesla Motors (TSLA) partner Nvidia (NVDA) and Qualcomm (QCOM) in the deep-learning market.And while Apple, Broadcom (AVGO), Qualcomm, Renesas Electronics, Socionext and Toshiba should be concerned about SoftBank being the owner of their primary core designer, Hackenberg doesn't expect a chip bidding war. But a communications battle between China's Xiaomi and Huawei is possible, he says.IBD'S TAKE: Intel leads IBD's 38-company Electronic Semiconductor-Manufacturing industry group, but the group has fallen to No. 95 out of 197 groups tracked, down from No. 80 last week. On Wednesday, Intel is expected to report a small revenue bump vs. last year, despite still-declining PC sales.Former executive with Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google, Nikesh Arora -- most recently SoftBank's chief operating officer -- was slated to take SoftBank's reins upon Son's 60th birthday. But Arora stepped down last month, and Son is staving off his retirement for five to 10 years, Goyal wrote in a research report.""Over the last two years, (Masayoshi) Son's partnership with Nikesh Arora had provided some consistency to an otherwise gut-driven, all-over-the-place investment approach,"" Goyal said. SoftBank's plan to acquire ARM is a return to that erratic strategy, he said.Prior to announcing its agreement to acquire ARM, SoftBank had been looking to take a 30% to 40% stake in a privately held company with the potential to disrupt age-old industry structures, Goyal wrote. SoftBank wasn't looking to completely take over a chip-design/licensing operation such as ARM.ARM's bread and butter lie in smartphones, but it also designs chips for smart cars, TVs, servers and, increasingly, wearables, drones and smart homes. But it's unclear how the Internet of Things (IoT) fits into the plans of communication-oriented SoftBank, which owns 83% of Sprint (S).IHS' Hackenberg notes ARM's IoT strategy which includes acquisitions of Sensinode in 2013, Sunrise Micro Devices in 2015 and Apical earlier this year. That dovetails well with SoftBank's vision to ""contribute to people's happiness through the Information Revolution,"" he wrote.""Despite surprise by many that SoftBank would be interested in a semiconductor technology, it is both within their vision -- and a really valuable resource -- for their business model as they ride the wave of PCs and software to mobile technologies and IoT,"" he wrote.The move into IoT is particularly opportune, Semiconductors Advisers' Maire says. Brexit sent the British pound crashing vs. the yen, which allowed SoftBank's deal for U.K.-based ARM to heat up over the last two weeks.But for Intel, it's a case of ""woulda, coulda, shoulda,"" Maire wrote.""Given the failure of Intel on the mobile side and its pullback, we had thought that the odds of a deal would have increased, as Intel would have been forced to buy what it couldn't win in the market,"" he wrote. This deal, though, could spur Intel to acquire other mobile plays, he says.ARM stock closed down 1.3% at 65.29 on the stock market today, after shooting up 41% on Monday following SoftBank's announcement. Intel stock was flat rose 0.3% to 35.15 ahead of its Q2 earnings late Wednesday.

508,QCOM,"Oracle (ORCL), Fitbit (FIT), Seagate Technology (STX), Ulta Beauty (ULTA) and Apple (AAPL) supplier Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) are Tuesday highlights, thanks to a changes in analyst opinion.BMO Capital Markets upgraded the Silicon Valley giant to outperform from market perform and raised its price target to 47 from 45.Shares were up 1.6% Tuesday on the stock market today.The Apple supplier was handed a downgrade to neutral from overweight from JPMorgan.

The company had formed a cup-with-handle base and briefly reached that buy point, but then it faltered in the wake of Great Britain's vote to leave the European Union.

509,QCOM,"Stock ETFs built on recent gains Tuesday as investors cheered a bounce in oil prices and more stimulus out of Japan to prod their plodding economy.The S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average set record highs. And in a sign of the broad strength of this equity rally, small-cap indexes are climbing to 2016 highs as they outperform their large-cap brethren.IShares Russell 2000 (IWM), the biggest small-cap ETF, jumped 1.3% on Tuesday to close at its best level since Dec. 1. IWM has advanced nearly 6% in the past five sessions -- roughly double the gains of SPDR S&P 500 (SPY).Tuesday's higher risk appetite weighed on safe haven assets such as gold and on defensive equity sectors such as consumer staples and utilities.Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK) added 0.8% on the stock market today to set a 52-week high.According to S&P Global Market Intelligence, the tech sector is a growing presence in the dividend space. Technology companies have experienced growing balances of cash and investments, and they have been increasingly committing capital to dividends, the research firm's equity analysts noted. Robust free cash flow and attractive balance sheets could translate to rising dividends from tech hardware and semiconductor companies in particular.One-third of the S&P 500 tech stocks do not offer a steady dividend stream, dimming the overall sector's income appeal. However, the average yield on the 46 stocks that sport one is 2.4%, according to S&P Dow Jones indexes.Technology stocks tend to be relatively underweighted in dividend ETFs because those strategies focus on long-term dividend records or stocks with the highest dividend yields, said Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF research for S&P Global.However, he added, some smaller names may boast higher tech exposure than the most well-known dividend funds, such as Vanguard Dividend Appreciation (VIG) or SPDR S&P Dividend (SDY).SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) fell Tuesday for a second straight session. The safe-haven asset tends to perform well when there is an uptick of fear in the stock markets.The ETF tracks the price of gold and is taking a hit after six consecutive weeks of gains.Stocks have rallied as a strong jobs report, coupled with subsiding Brexit fears, have boosted investor sentiment. And in Japan on Monday, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe ordered new stimulus after his coalition won an election by a landslide.Here's a look at how major exchange traded funds, tracking various asset classes, performed today, with Relative Price Strength (RS) ratings.The RS rating is a measure of their price performance over the last 12 months, compared to all stocks and ETFs in the IBD database, on a scale of 1 to a best-possible 99:SPDR S&P 500 (SPY), +0.7%, RS 61PowerShares QQQ (QQQ), +0.5%, RS 51SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA), +0.7%, RS 58IShares Core S&P Mid-Cap (IJH), +1.0%, RS 68IShares Russell 2000 (IWM), +1.3%, RS 61IShares MSCI EAFE (EFA), +1.4%, RS 29Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets (VWO), +1.5%, RS 51SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), -1.7%, RS 80United States Oil (USO), +5.1%, RS 21IShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond (AGG), -0.3%, RS 51PowerShares DB U.S.$ Bullish (UUP), -0.1%, RS 39IPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures (VXX), -2.2%, RS 3

510,QCOM,"Better-than-expected PC shipments in Q2 are likely a blip in the industry's downfall, but they will coalesce with Apple's (AAPL) iPhone 7, the ramp in 3D flash-memory and autonomous driving partnerships to help No. 1 chipmaker Intel (INTC) find its ""mojo,"" analysts said Tuesday.Graphics-chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) could also move higher on improving PC shipments and its Zen processor launch in October to rival Intel in the enterprise server market, MKM analyst Ian Ing wrote in a research report. There, Intel has 98%-99% market share.Ing rates both a buy. On Tuesday, he boosted his price target on Intel stock to 39 from 38, and on Advanced Micro Devices stock to 6.30 from 5. Nomura analyst Romit Shah has a buy rating and 35 price target on Intel stock.IBD'S TAKE: AMD has a middling Composite Rating of 64, meaning it outperforms nearly two-thirds of all stocks in terms of key metrics such as earnings growth. IBD's 41-company Electronic Semiconductor-Fabless industry group ranks No. 31 out of 197 groups tracked and has climbed from No. 69 over two months. Nvidia leads the group with a CR of 99.PC shipments declined only 4.5% year over year in Q2, according to industry tracker IDC, vs. projections for an 8% plunge, Shah says. Despite this, ""no one we have spoken with sees a durable recovery in PCs,"" he wrote in a research report.Still, Shah expects Intel to outperform in Q2 and Q3 as it preps to source 15 million to 20 million modems for Apple's iPhone 7, to incumbent Qualcomm's (QCOM) detriment.As Intel diversifies, it stands a chance to regain its ""mojo,"" Ing wrote in a report. Intel's PC segment comprised 55% of Q1 sales, but its Skylake central processing units have room to grow. Data center sales (29% of Q1 sales) are supported by share gains in networking, Ing said.Intel is also delving into the red-hot autonomous-driving world and, on July 1, joined BMW (BMWYY) and Mobileye (MBLY) announcing an open-source fully autonomous driving solution by 2021. Rather than rivaling Tesla (TSLA) partner Nvidia (NVDA), Intel's offering will be a complement, Ing wrote.AMD, an Nvidia rival in graphics processing units (GPUs), could see shares lift on ""good enough"" Q2 results late Thursday, Ing wrote. AMD is expected to report an 8 cent loss per-share ex items, improving from a 17 cent loss in the year-earlier period, on flat sales at $951.3 million.""We like AMD over the coming quarters, given a series of new product ramps that close the gap vs. the competition and a backdrop of steadily improving PC demand,"" Ing wrote. ""Computing and semi-custom strength should offset GPUs, which are less of a contributor.""Intel is slated to report its Q2 earnings after the close Wednesday. At the closing bell on the stock market today, Intel stock finished the session down a fraction to 35.15, while AMD stock fell more than 1.85% to 5.41.

511,QCOM,"Japan's SoftBank (SFTBY) will buy ARM Holdings (ARMH), a U.K. maker of wireless chip designs used by Apple (AAPL) and Samsung smartphones, for more than $32 billion, the companies confirmed early Monday.SoftBank agreed to pay 24.3 billion pounds ($32.1 billion) cash for ARM Holdings. ARM had a market capitalization of $22 billion before the deal. ARM's U.S. shares shot up nearly 41% to 66.17 on the stock market today. SoftBank fell 7.8% to 26.22.ARM Holdings dominates the market for wireless microprocessors for the Apple iPhone and other mobile devices. With smartphone sales stagnating and Apple iPhone sales falling, ARM earnings growth has slowed. But it's a player in the booming market for chip designs for the Internet of Things.SoftBank pledged to maintain ARM's current management, to double its U.K. workforce and to expand its overseas headcount over the next five years.SoftBank benefits from a stronger yen and cheaper pound in this deal. Since the U.K. voted to leave the European Union, the pound is down 12% vs. the Japanese yen. That makes it far cheaper for Softbank to buy ARM, but SoftBank said currency swings weren't a factor in the deal.SoftBank also owns 85% of U.S. telecom Sprint (S). Sprint fell 5% as investors see a shift in resources to buying ARM that could have gone to the wireless operator.SoftBank recently agreed to sell its 72% stake in Supercell, creator of mobile game ""Clash of Clans,"" for $7.8 billion to China's Tencent Holdings (TCEHY).IBD's TAKE: ARM Holdings is just one of many Apple chip suppliers. Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) reports on Thursday, but SWKS earnings are expected to fall for a sixth straight quarter. Skyworks stock has been in a downturn since June 2015, but it has recently retaken its declining 50-day line. Meanwhile, Qualcomm (QCOM) is expected to report a fifth straight EPS decline.

512,QCOM,"Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Cirrus Logic (CRUS) shares nosedived Tuesday after Pacific Crest analyst Michael McConnell downgraded the stocks and predicted a 15%-20% decline in Apple (AAPL) iPhone 7 shipments later this year compared with shipments of the iPhone 6S after that product was released last September.Cirrus Logic stock closed down 6% at 35.76 on the stock market today, and Skyworks Solutions also fell 6%, closing at 58.82. Broadcom (AVGO), Analog Devices (ADI) and Qualcomm (QCOM) stocks followed, down a respective 2.2%, 2.3% and 2%.McConnell downgraded Cirrus Logic and Skyworks stocks to sector weight. He cut his price target on Broadcom to 180 from 185, on Analog Devices to 60 from 62, and on Qualcomm to 59 from 61.Cirrus Logic will benefit from Apple's transition to digital headsets, and Skyworks is likely to gain 10%-15% radio frequency content in the iPhone 7, but ""we ultimately don't believe this will be enough to offset a 15%-20% decline in iPhone 7 shipments,"" McConnell wrote in a research note, comparing it with the iPhone 6S.He has a 40 price target on Cirrus Logic stock and a 90 price target on Skyworks stock.Slowing iPhone sales will similarly slug InvenSense (INVN), Qorvo (QRVO), Synaptics (SYNA) and Texas Instruments (TXN), McConnell wrote, also cutting his estimates on these companies. Qualcomm will continue to struggle to re-sign Chinese licensees under new agreements, he said.But No. 1 chipmaker Intel (INTC), which will reportedly supply a third of the Apple iPhone 7 modems, got a price target boost to 37 from 35 on better-than-seasonal notebook forecasts for Q3, up 7%-10% sequentially vs. typical 6% growth, he said.Graphics chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) garnered higher estimates on its July GeForce 1060 launch date to compete with rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). Coupled with strong demand and higher average sales prices, Nvidia is likely to exceed its Q2 guidance, McConnell wrote.

513,QCOM,"Apple’s (AAPL) second-quarter earnings miss is sending shares way below a critical level. Its ecosystem of suppliers is feeling some heat but holding up relatively well, including Broadcom (AVGO), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Cirrus Logic (CRUS).The consumer tech giant’s EPS fell 19% to $1.90 while revenue dropped 13% to $50.6 billion. Both missed Wall Street views; so did Apple's Q3 revenue outlook.Apple reported its first-ever year-over-year iPhone sales decline, a 16% drop to a little over 51 million units.The stock plunged 6.3% to 97.82  in giant volume in the stock market today, breaching the key downward-sloping 50-day moving average as it gaps way down. After trending lower for several months, the 50-day line began to move higher along with Apple shares, until recently. Shares are now trading 26% below their all-time high, reached a year ago.IBD's Take: How healthy is Apple stock? Find out at IBD Stock CheckupMeanwhile, Apple supplier Broadcom fell to its 50-day line, but rallied to close up 0.5% at 151.53.Skyworks Solutions sold off early but ended 0.9% higher at 72.32. Skyworks looks to have hit resistance at its 50-day line.Qualcomm (QCOM) settled down 1 cent at 52.90. Qualcomm is trading in between its 50-day and 200-day lines and is about 26% below its 52-week high.Meanwhile, Cirrus Logic was down as much as 5.5% in premarket trade but roared back for an 12.4% intraday gain, back above its 50-day line, as it beat quarterly results late Tuesday. Cirrus Logic's current-quarter revenue guidance was light.

514,QCOM,"Apple (AAPL) suppliers Broadcom (AVGO) and Qualcomm (QCOM) were pitted Tuesday in a theoretical battle to acquire Xilinx (XLNX) which, late Wednesday, is expected to report flat fiscal fourth-quarter sales along with down earnings.Xilinx stock was up 1.3% to 46.38 on the stock market today. It split the difference between gains by fellow takeover candidates Cavium (CAVM) and Marvell Technology Group (MRVL), up 3.4% and 0.75%, respectively.MKM analyst Ian Ing lists the trio among small- and medium-size fabless firms subject to acquisition as semiconductor companies scramble to serve the top 20 customers: Apple, Samsung, Cisco Systems (CSCO), Nokia (NOK), Ericsson (ERIC) and China's Huawei, among others.""Customers prefer the fewest suppliers while preserving multi-sourcing choice,"" Ing wrote in a research report. ""Fabless companies can improve their operating models with more scale in manufacturing and operations.""Field-programmable gate array (FPGA) makers are proving attractive targets. In December, Intel (INTC) completed its acquisition of Altera, an FPGA-maker. For Broadcom, the technology would round out its networking and communications equipment needs.Qualcomm needs to diversify from its core mobile business which is threatened by chipsets and disagreements with licensees in China, Ing wrote.Ing expects Xilinx to tack on $3 earnings per share to 2017 run rates, ""should a large acquirer apply scale benefits."" He rates Xilinx stock a neutral and has a 46 price target, noting it's coming off a 2015 data center and communications trough.For Q4, which ended in December, Xilinx is expected to report flat sales of $566.2 million and adjusted earnings per share of 52 cents, down 10% year over year. For fiscal 2016, the consensus of 21 analysts models $2.2 billion and $2.03, down a respective 7% and 16.5%.

516,QCOM,"Wall Street expectations for Apple (AAPL) iPhone supplier Qualcomm (QCOM) to report $1.83 billion in September-quarter licensing revenue is too aggressive, Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said Thursday as he downgraded Qualcomm stock.Qualcomm stock has lifted 24.5% since hitting a nearly six-year low below 43 on Feb. 11. But Qualcomm is in a ""no growth scenario,"" estimates haven't yet bottomed and the Apple supplier is likely to miss its fiscal Q4 (ending in September) licensing views by $150 million, Rasgon says.Tough contract negotiations and antitrust investigations in China, South Korea and Taiwan have stunted Qualcomm's growth. In China, investors are concerned that product makers are underreporting chip set sales as Qualcomm works to re-sign customers to new contracts.""To see significant upside from here we would need confidence in some long-term growth story and comfort that estimates have bottomed,"" he wrote in a research report. ""However, we find ourselves still a bit hesitant to sign up for the former.""And estimates remain too high, Rasgon says. For fiscal Q3, Qualcomm expects total reported device sales (TRDS) to reach $52 billion to $60 billion from its licensees. The consensus models $57.4 billion. Qualcomm collects licensing fees from those sales.For fiscal Q4, the consensus expects Qualcomm to collect $1.83 billion in licensing fees, $150 million ahead of Rasgon's $1.68 billion estimate. Rasgon models a 12% dip in licensing fees from the June quarter, or down 2% sequentially when adjusting for a $200 million catch-up payment from LG.""We suspect the consensus may be modeling in 'catch-up' (licensing revenues) from new China deals, which suggests that either licensing outlook could miss expectations if they don't sign deals, or that there is limited upside to the numbers if they do,"" he wrote.More broadly, investors are concerned about potential share losses to Intel and potential order cuts in the second half of 2016. Apple reportedly tapped Intel (INTC) to source some of its iPhone 7 modems, partially replacing incumbent Qualcomm.Rasgon downgraded Qualcomm stock to market perform but kept a 55 price target, representing ""a company that doesn't go into secular decline, but also never grows free cash flow again.""Qualcomm stock ended virtually flat at 53.57 on the stock market today, as it's being tested at its 50-day line.

517,QCOM,"Facebook (FB) aims to be a player in setting 5G wireless standards as the social networking leader expands into communications services, but traditional telecom companies should not be over-alarmed, says Bernstein Research.While Apple (AAPL) also has an interest in emerging wireless technologies and standards, the Cupertino, Calif.-based iPhone maker prefers to stay in the background. Apple is a member of the Next Generation Mobile Networks (NGMN) alliance, a group which looks at such issues.Facebook's interest goes back a few years. In 2013, the company launched its Internet.org initiative, which aims to bring low-cost broadband services to emerging markets, in partnership with Ericsson (ERIC) and Qualcomm (QCOM). In early June, Facebook organized the first Telecom Infra Project (TIP) conference, which was attended by Nokia (NOK), Intel (INTC), Vodafone (VOD) and others.""As part of the TIP, Facebook has ventured into the design of early 5G prototypes,"" Bernstein said in a research report. ""Facebook's initiatives shouldn't be overplayed, though. Even though Facebook has taken an active role in deploying new wireless services in emerging markets, it remains limited, and the company has regularly affirmed its intentions to let telecom operators and vendors drive the development of infrastructure.""Facebook's WhatsApp and other messaging services have been adding communications features. Recently, Facebook has pushed into broadcasting live video from mobile phones, which adds congestion to wireless networks.Global 5G standards -- the faster broadband technology that will replace today's highest-end 4G -- are in development. U.S. wireless leaders Verizon Communications (VZ) and AT&T (T) are pushing ahead with 5G fixed-point testing, aimed at delivering broadband to homes. The Federal Communications Commission on July 14 is expected to vote on a proposal to open up high-frequency airwaves for 5G services.In addition to 5G fixed wireless services, telecom companies are working on 5G standards for the ""Internet of Things"" -- web-connected consumer and industrial devices.Current 4G networks will eventually be upgraded to faster 5G speeds, improving delivery of video and virtual reality apps to mobile devices, analysts say. Autonomous, self-driving cars are viewed as another use for 5G.A complete 5G standard might not be ready until 2020 or later, but some companies or groups could agree on certain interim standards as early as next year.Facebook aims to spur competition among equipment vendors as well as 5G deployment by wireless carriers, says the Bernstein report.""We expect players like Facebook to continue to focus on their much higher return on investment core businesses, and keep playing in this field the role of a shepherd's dog, making sure the industry delivers the better infrastructure they need to continue to thrive,"" the Bernstein report said.

518,QCOM,"The U.K.'s decision last week to exit the European Union apparently hasn't slowed the EU's regulatory crackdown on big U.S. tech companies.The EU is taking steps that could lead to a third antitrust complaint against Alphabet (GOOGL)-owned Google, this time over its lucrative advertising services, Bloomberg reported Monday.The European Commission's antitrust authority is likely to file a formal statement of objections after it receives permission from the search leader's critics to share their evidence with Google, Bloomberg said.In the other two antitrust cases,  Alphabet's Google was charged with unfairly promoting its own services over rivals in shopping search services and abusing its dominant market share position with the Android mobile operating system.U.S. critics have accused Europe's antitrust regulator of being motivated by an anti-American bias in its pursuit of cases against U.S. companies. The EU has launched probes against Amazon.com (AMZN), Qualcomm (QCOM) and other major U.S. firms.In February, U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew accused the EU of unfairly targeting American companies in its investigation into possible corporate tax avoidance. EU targets in the tax probe include Amazon, Apple (AAPL) and Starbucks (SBUX).Amid continued fallout from Britain's vote Thursday to exit the EU, Alphabet stock dipped 0.6% to 661.14 in the stock market today, touching an eight-month intraday low after falling 4.2% on Friday.

519,QCOM,"While not mentioning Apple (AAPL) by name, Qualcomm (QCOM) implied it will lose business to Intel (INTC) as a chip supplier for the iPhone 7, Apple's newest smartphone expected to launch this fall.The comments came during the company's quarterly earnings conference call after the market close Wednesday, with Qualcomm's EPS guidance falling short of Wall Street estimates.Qualcomm CEO Steve Mollenkopf told analysts it was important for planning purposes to factor in “a range of second-sourcing assumptions at our large customers.” He said improving demand for premium and high-tier devices in the second half of the fiscal year would be “offset by reduced demand for thin modem products and low-tier chipsets.”“Apple iPhone 7 modem share loss is confirmed,” wrote Pacific Crest Securities analyst Michael McConnell in a research note late Wednesday, a point of view shared by other analysts.The understanding is that Intel will be a second-source supplier to Apple for chips in the iPhone 7 that manage connections to wireless networks, called either modem or baseband chips. Qualcomm is expected to remain the primary supplier to Apple for these chips, but the win by Intel was seen as a setback to Qualcomm, the leading smartphone chip developer.McConnell says Qualcomm is likely to lose a 20% to 30% share of baseband chips in the new iPhone to Intel, worth annual revenue of about $600 million to $900 million, he wrote.He maintained an overweight rating on Qualcomm but lowered the price target to 61 from 63.Qualcomm stock was down about 1%, near 51.50, ahead of the closing bell in the stock market today. Qualcomm stock is down 25% in the past year.The loss to Intel comes as Qualcomm is maneuvering through a slowdown in smartphone sales as the market nears saturation. Qualcomm lowered its guidance on smartphone device sales to about 1.67 billion in 2016 from previous guidance of 1.72 billion. It expects year-over-year growth of about 8%, down from 10%.IDC estimates smartphone shipments in 2015 rose 10% to 1.4 billion units, slowing from 27% growth in 2014. IDC expects smartphone growth in China to be flat in 2016.It was the maturing smartphone market and the potential for market share loss that that caused Rosenblatt Securities to downgrade Qualcomm to neutral from buy, though it maintained a price target of 57.RBC Capital analyst Amit Daryanani said there was a lot to digest in the Qualcomm earnings report, given the increased uncertainty. Risks to the stock price include lower smartphone pricing, lower royalty rates, increased competition from a variety of manufacturers and slower smartphone growth.Qualcomm is dealing with the market changes in multiple ways. It has focused on a $1.4 billion cost-reduction plan, boosting cash flow and profit, bolstering research and development, positioning for industry growth and making China licensing a top priority, among other steps. The company says that it’s on track to realize at least $700 million in savings in fiscal 2016, an increase of $100 million from its original estimate.Qualcomm reported revenue of $5.6 billion for the quarter ended March 27, down 19% from the year-earlier quarter but beating the consensus estimate of $5.34 billion. It was the fourth quarter in a row of decelerating revenue, year over year.Earnings per share minus items fell 26% to $1.04, but that number topped the 96-cent consensus estimate of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. It was the fourth quarter in a row that EPS has decelerated. Qualcomm's fiscal Q3 revenue guidance beat, but views on EPS missed.
"
520,QCOM,"With a lot of moving parts in play, smartphone chip supplier Qualcomm (QCOM) is scheduled to report earnings for its December quarter after the market close Wednesday.The consensus estimate for Qualcomm’s fiscal second quarter is for revenue of $5.34 billion, down 22% year over year and the fourth quarter in a row of revenue deceleration. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect earnings per share minus items of 96 cents, down 31% and also the fourth straight quarter of deceleration.Tough contract negotiations have previously stunted Qualcomm's licensing revenue growth, along with a royalty dispute with South Korea-based LG. Last year, there were a number of lawsuits globally related to Qualcomm’s licensing business. Investors also are concerned about the under-reporting of device sales among China vendors. The completion of new licensing deals has helped to alleviate those concerns.Qualcomm continues to make notable progress signing China license agreements, says Michael McConnell, an analyst with Pacific Crest Securities, in a research note. Since Qualcomm issued fiscal 2016 guidance, it has inked four of the top five China smartphone OEMs to new license agreements, with Lenovo being the highlight signing, he wrote. McConnell has a buy rating on Qualcomm  stock, and a price target of 63.Qualcom stock is trading near 52 ahead of Wednesday's open, rising a fraction Tuesday and down 4% for 2016.Credit Suisse analyst Kulbinder Garcha, in a research note, said he does not see the fundamental outlook for Qualcomm’s smartphone business improving. Still, he says improved execution at Qualcomm, a recovery at Samsung, rising revenue diversity and further compliance from Chinese vendors should give a boost to the earnings outlook. He reiterated an outperform rating on Qualcomm stock, with a price target of 67.“While we do see some potential weakness at Apple (APPL), i.e. weak shipments and potential share loss to Intel (INTC), we believe the early success of the (Samsung) Galaxy S7 indicate that our forecasts are sufficiently conservative,” he wrote.Canaccord Genuity analyst Michael Walkley recently maintained a buy rating on Qualcomm stock and a price target of 65. He wrote that while Intel might take some chip-unit share from Qualcomm for the Apple iPhone 7, Qualcomm will maintain its majority position.""Overall, we are impressed by Qualcomm’s long-term technical roadmap, believe more optimistic long-term technology licensing growth targets are achievable, and appreciate the new focus of the management team to streamline the business and cost controls,” Walkley wrote.Of the 35 analysts that follow Qualcomm, as reported by Thomson Reuters, seven rate the stock a strong buy and 12 a buy. Another 15 have holding ratings, and there is one underperform rating.Intel late Tuesday said it would cut about 11% of its workforce, some 12,000 positions, as it restructures to put less emphasis on the fading PC business and more on rising areas such as the Internet of Things. Despite years of efforts, Intel so far has had minimal success in getting its chips into smartphones and other mobile devices, but many observers say it will likely have chips inside the next Apple iPhone, expected to be released in September.
"
521,QCOM,"No. 1 chipmaker Intel (INTC) lagged Wall Street's Q1 revenue expectations late Tuesday on PC sales that grew minimally vs. the year-earlier quarter, and announced that up to 12,000 positions would be cut by mid-2017.The 12,000-cut represents 11% of Intel's global workforce and will require ""a combination of voluntary and involuntary departures and a re-evaluation of programs,"" according to the press release. Most affected employees will be notified within 60 days.And CFO Stacy Smith will move to a ""broader, new role within Intel"" leading sales, manufacturing and operations, and reporting directly to CEO Brian Krzanich. Smith will remain in his role pending a formal CFO search, Krzanich said on Intel's conference call with analysts, after it released results.Intel stock was down more than 2% after hours, having closed down 0.2% during the regular session. Shares are weaker by 8% for the year, having rebounded from a slide in January and mid-February amid reports of weak Taiwanese ODM sales.Krzanich detailed the restructuring in an email to employees, highlighting Intel's stepping away from PCs to focus on high-growth segments like the data center, Internet of Things and memory which, together, brought in $2.2 billion in revenue growth in 2015.""We are evolving from a PC company to a company that powers billions of smart, connected devices,"" Krzanich said on the call. ""We do not take these changes lightly. We will be saying goodbye to employees who have played a great role in Intel's success.""By restructuring, Intel plans to save $750 million in the first year, with an annual run rate savings of $1.4 billion by mid-2017, allowing Intel to ""intensify"" its investments in its key growth areas.Ultimately, ""we expect an even more profitable client computing group (PC),"" Krzanich added. PC sales comprised 55% of Intel's Q1 sales, but have struggled in recent quarters amid stiff tablet and two-in-one competition.For Q1 ended April 2, Intel reported $13.7 billion in sales and 54 cents earnings per share, up 7% and 20%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier quarter. EPS topped analyst expectations by more than a nickel, but sales missed.The consensus of 45 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters modeled $13.83 billion in sales (against Intel's non-GAAP revenue of $13.8 billion) and 48 cents EPS, in line with Intel's earlier view for $14 billion in sales, plus or minus $500 million.Nonvolatile memory sales declined 6% vs. the year-earlier quarter, underperforming the struggling PC unit, which managed to climb 2% year over year.Intel's high-growth units -- data center and Internet of Things -- grew a respective 9% and 22% year over year. Security sales popped 12% vs. the year-earlier quarter.Krzanich didn't address recent rumors that Apple (AAPL) might tap Intel to supply 30 million-40 million iPhone 7 modems -- a development that had sent Intel's stock jumping. Qualcomm (QCOM) typically sources the iPhone modem and would retain the lion's share of the iPhone 7, analysts say.Analysts largely doubt Intel's mobile strategy, which hasn't yet played out. But Krzanich, on the call, defended the mobile unit, which he said ""is absolutely continuing to grow for us as a segment, and we're increasing our profitability.""For the current quarter, Intel guided to $13 billion to $14 billion in sales, which would be up 2% at the midpoint vs. the year-earlier quarter. The company reduced its full-year guidance to mid-single-digit growth. Earlier, Intel saw mid- to high-single-digit growth.Pacific Crest and S&P Global Market Intelligence analysts had expected Intel to cut its full-year guidance on the ebbing PC market, which industry trackers IDC and Gartner recently saw dipping 11.5% and 9.6%, respectively, in Q1 shipments.Days after the forecasts emerged, rumors cropped up that Intel might be prepping to cut thousands of jobs. Image provided by Shutterstock.

522,QCOM,"Amazon.com (AMZN) tapped Texas Instruments (TXN) to lead its ""hockey-puck-sized"" Echo Dot Alexa-infused speaker, and incorporated Apple (AAPL) suppliers Broadcom (AVGO) and NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) in its portable Tap stereo, iFixit teardowns show.But the teardowns did little to help chipmakers Thursday on Wall Street. Chip stocks were broadly down in afternoon trading on the stock market today, in conjunction with fractional dips for the major indexes.Texas Instruments won five chips -- including a digital media processor -- inside the Echo Dot, but that total was skimmed down from eight chips inside the larger Echo. Also, Samsung succeeded SanDisk (SNDK) as the flash memory supplier.Echo Dot also features a DRAM (dynamic random-access memory) chip from Micron Technology (MU), apparently replacing a Samsung RAM chip in the Echo. Qualcomm (QCOM) re-won the Bluetooth function from the Echo.The smaller Echo Dot earned a six out of a best-possible 10 in its repairability rating, dropping from seven in the earlier Echo iteration.Amazon's Tap won a seven out of 10. It's Amazon's first Alexa-equipped portable speaker vs. the Echo Dot and Echo, according to iFixit.Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM) topped the Tap with two chips -- an audio codec and a power management chip. Texas Instruments supplied an amplifier. Apple suppliers Broadcom and NXP won a chip apiece -- WiFi/Bluetooth and an applications processor, respectively.The device is powered by a lithium-ion cell, such as those used in Tesla Motors (TSLA) vehicles, iFixit notes. It provides for nine hours of music playback, according to Amazon, vs. the iPhone 6S Plus, which has ""a battery with a similar output for a radically different job.""

523,QCOM,"Apple (AAPL) pushed backed its quarterly earnings report by one day, to Tuesday, April 26, after the market close. Apple was little changed after hours following a 0.2% regular session gain.United Airlines (UAL) said it would temper its growth plans to balance out supply with demand, following similar remarks from Delta Air Lines (DAL) last week, and said it expects second-quarter consolidated passenger unit revenue to fall at least 6.5%.United Airlines' first quarter earnings per share fell 19% to $1.23, beating views by a nickel. Revenue fell 4.8% to $8.2 billion, in line with estimates. Consolidated passenger unit revenue fell 7.4%, with the strong dollar weighing and declines in holiday close-in business travel that were bigger than expected.The results come as pressure grows on airlines to turn around declines in unit revenue, a key measure of a carrier's performance.Earlier, United announced a board shakeup to appease activist investors.United stock fell 2.3% in late trading.Yum Brands (YUM), the operator of Taco Bell, KFC and Pizza Hut, said it was on pace to spin off its China unit by the end of the year after a series of food-safety scandals.The company reported Q1 EPS up 19% to 95 cents, surpassing forecasts by 12 cents. Sales of $2.62 bil narrowly missed, flat vs. a year earlier. Same-store sales rose 2%, which China comps up 6%.

Citrix stock rose 7.8%.F5 Networks (FFIV) Q2 revenue rose 2% to $483.7 mil, missing, with EPS up 5% to $1.68, beating. Q3 EPS guidance of $1.77- $1.80 topped; its sales view missed. Shares rose 4.5%.Lam Research (LRCX) said Q3 revenue fell 5% to $1.314 bil, in line. Lam's EPS of $1.18 topped views. The chip equipment maker’s stock edged higher.Tractor Supply (TSCO), which sells supplies to farms and ranches reported a 19% bump in Q1 EPS to 50 cents, with sales up 10% to $1.47 billion, both beating views. Tractor Supply stock rose nearly 5% late, breaking out of a base.Casino operator Las Vegas Sands' (LVS) Q1 EPS fell 32% to 45 cents, badly missing estimates for 63 cents.

525,QCOM,"Apple (AAPL) will tap No. 1 chipmaker Intel (INTC) to source 30-40 million iPhone 7 modems, but rival Qualcomm (QCOM) will remain top dog, Canaccord analyst T. Michael Walkley predicts.Meanwhile, Qualcomm's Chinese-licensing recovery is under way despite a $100 million quarterly dispute with South Korean LG, he wrote in a research report. Walkley reiterated his buy rating and 65 price target on Qualcomm stock.Qualcomm rose 0.6% and Intel 1% on the stock market today.  Apple fell 2.2%, extending losses after dropping below its 200-day moving average on Friday.IBD's Take: How healthy is Apple's stock? Find out at IBD Stock CheckupFor fiscal Q2 ended March 27, the consensus of 35 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Qualcomm to report 96 cents EPS minus items on $5.34 billion in sales, down 33% and 23%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier quarter.Three months ago, Qualcomm guided to $4.9 billion to $5.7 billion in sales and 90 cents to $1 EPS ex items. Then, Qualcomm outlined its improving Chinese negotiations which included four re-signed government-approved contracts.""With the recently signed Lenovo deal, we believe Qualcomm now has the top four Chinese (smartphone makers) licensed for 3-mode and all 3G/4G devices,"" Walkley wrote in a research report. He expects licensing sales to buoy in the latter half of 2016.Licensing sales toppled 20% sequentially back in fiscal Q3, ended last June 28, to just short of $2 billion amid the negotiations. Since then, the unit has seen 7%-8% sequential declines. No more, Credit Suisse analyst Kulbinder Garcha says.For Q2, Garcha expects $2.2 billion in licensing sales, up 36% sequentially and down 10% vs. the year-earlier quarter. He expects $7.5 billion in total 2016 licensing revenue growing to $7.6 billion in 2017.But Qualcomm's chip sales could get snagged in headwinds, Garcha says. Qualcomm quintupled its content in the Samsung Galaxy S7, teardowns show, but it will likely lose some iPhone 7 share to Intel even as Apple shipments lag.Garcha retained his outperform rating and 67 price target on Qualcomm stock, which closed Monday at 51.55, up about 3% in 2016. Qualcomm has been in a downtrend for nearly two years.

529,QCOM,"'What seems too high and risky to the majority generally goes higher, and what seems low and cheap generally goes lower.""  -- William J. O’Neil, ""How To Make Money In Stocks""You wouldn’t know it by reading financial magazines and listening to market pundits on television, but buying low and selling high in the stock market is an extra risky endeavor that can lead to less-than-desirable returns.When tech stocks topped in 2000, some people couldn’t wait to buy Qualcomm (QCOM) after it lost nearly 50% of its value. After hitting a split-adjusted high of 100 in January, it hit a low of 51.50 three months later, tempting numerous traders and fund managers. But the stock lost another 50% of its value over the next three months. Battered investors were in “hold and hope” or ""hold and mope"" mode, a situation that should be avoided at all costs.Contrary to conventional wisdom, buying low and selling high is not an easy way to make money in the stock market. In fact, it can be quite risky because in many cases, you’re buying damaged goods.A large number of stocks selling near lows are in trouble due to deteriorating fundamentals or shrinking market share. These are two qualities you don’t want to see in a stock and are often the reasons why mutual fund managers decide to sell.Remember, the goal is to target growth stocks that are being bought heavily by institutional investors, not sold.Make no mistake. It’s not easy holding a growth stock for a long-term gain, especially during periods of market volatility. Some will try to break out and fail one or two days later. Others will break out, rally 10% to 15%, only to see the gain go back to break-even. A lofty distribution day count in the major averages is often the culprit.Growth stocks need a positive market tide to succeed. When growth-fund managers are coming in from the sidelines and putting money to work, that’s when buying high and selling higher can pay off big.Apple had a healthy market going for it when shares broke out one year into the bull market that started in March 2003. Apple cleared a well-formed base in early March 2004 (not shown in accompanying chart). It rallied 37% before settling into a new base in 2004. It broke out again from a base-on-base pattern during the week ended Aug. 27.After rising more than 150% from its initial breakout, many thought the big money had already been made in the stock. But Apple was still innovating with successful product launches when it cleared a flat base in January 2005. Buying high turned out to be the right strategy again, as institutional investors continued to accumulate shares. Another breakout from a cup-with-handle base followed after that.Bottom line: Don’t be afraid to buy a stock when it’s showing supreme relative strength and sitting near highs. There’s no shortage of precedents that show big market winners staging multiple breakouts during multiyear runs. Don’t be quick to say it’s too late, especially if a compelling growth story is still intact.

530,QCOM,"Yahoo (YHOO), Intel (INTC) and UnitedHealth (UNH) headline another busy day for earnings, though investors may look past headline EPS for all three industry giants.Yahoo is expected to report a 53% year-over-year decline in EPS to 7 cents after the market close Tuesday. Revenue likely fell 12% to $1.08 billion, with revenue excluding traffic acquisition costs seen declining even faster. CEO Marissa Mayer has been unable to fuel significant growth since taking the helm in 2012.What investors will want to know is any information on the Yahoo bidding process, with offers due on Monday. Yahoo is entertaining offers for all or part of the Web portal, including its core U.S. operations and its Alibaba (BABA) stake. It's unclear if Yahoo will say anything at all. Various reports said Verizon Communications (VZ) and YP Holdings, owned by Cerberus Capital and AT&T (T), are among the purported bidders.Yahoo stock rose 1 cent to 36.52 on the stock market today. Shares hit an 8-month high of 37.50 last week.Intel also reports after Tuesday's closing bell. Analysts expect EPS to rise 15% to 47 cents, with revenue up 8% to $13.83 billion. The key is to what extent data center chips offset weakness for PC chips. Investors will want to know if weak PC sales are continuing in Q2, and whether Intel will cut full-year guidance.Looking ahead, Apple may source 30 million to 40 million iPhone 7 modem chips from Intel, taking share from Qualcomm (QCOM), according to Canaccord analyst T. Michael Walkley. Qualcomm, which reports earnings Wednesday evening, will still get most of that business. Apple will release its iPhone 7 later this year.Intel rose 0.6% on Monday, find support just over its  200-day moving average. Qualcomm rose 1%, but remains in a downtrend going back to mid-2014. Apple fell 2.2%, continuing to fall after undercutting its 200-day line.The No. 1 U.S. health insurer, and the first to report Q1 results, is due out Tuesday morning. Analysts expect an 18% EPS rise to $1.72, with revenue up 23% to $43.96 billion. Investors will looking for industry clues about membership, medical costs.  They'll also want to know more about UnitedHealth's plans for the ObamaCare exchange. UnitedHealth, which was cautious about entering these marketplaces, has been the most vocal about getting out, perhaps  entirely in 2017, due to ongoing losses. UnitedHealth last week announced it was exiting the Arkansas, Georgia and Michigan exchanges.If UnitedHealth drastically scales back its participation, it could reduce competition and boost premiums for enrollees. But if UnitedHealth spurs a stampede of insurers getting out, the impact could be huge.UnitedHealth stock rose to a new high a month ago, moving sideways since then. Shares rose 0.4% to 127.81 on Monday.

531,QCOM,"Analysts downgraded Apple (AAPL) iPhone suppliers Skyworks (SWKS) and Qorvo (QRVO), while also weighing in on the outlook for Netflix (NFLX) and SolarCity's (SCTY) proposed merger with Tesla (TSLA).Mizuho downgraded Skyworks to a neutral from buy, slashing its price target on the wireless chipmaker to 68 from 99. The research firm stressed the need for Skyworks to diversify its revenue stream as its core smartphone market, which accounts for 75% of sales, slows.Mizuho also downgraded Qorvo to neutral from buy, putting a 55 target on the wireless and broadband chipmaker, in line with its closing price on Thursday.Skyworks shares fell 1.1% to 62.60 in the stock market today. Qorvo lost 1.4% to 54.50. Apple shares rose 0.3% to 95.89, but found resistance at the 50-day line.Canaccord started coverage on Netflix with a buy rating and 120 target. Earlier this week, Nielsen disclosed viewership data for streaming shows on Netflix, Hulu and other platforms.The premier episode of ""Orange is the New Black,"" which is produced by Netflix and streams on the site, was seen by 6.7 million in the U.S., comparable to HBO's hit ""Game of Thrones.""Netflix shares were up 5.7% Friday.Credit Suisse said that it thinks Tesla's proposed merger substantially undervalues SolarCity. Still, the research firm sees 60% to 70% odds that the deal closes with little or no change in the terms. It cut its rating on SolarCity to neutral from outperform, lowering the target to 27 from 38.Shares were down 0.7%.Evercore ISI downgraded Qualcomm (QCOM) to hold from buy. That followed Qualcomm's downgrade by Bernstein on Thursday, which sees Wall Street expectations for licensing revenue as too aggressive.Qualcomm was off 1.1% to 53.Meanwhile, RBC Capital Markets pared its price target on Texas Instruments (TXN) to 66 from 68 while keeping an outperform rating. Texas Instruments fell 0.9% to 62.11.Barclays downgraded temporary staffing firm Manpower's (MAN) to equal weight from overweight, slicing the price target to 65 from 85. Analysts cited the company's 64% exposure to Europe in the wake of Brexit. Manpower skidded 2.2% to 62.95.

532,QCOM,"No. 1 chipmaker Intel (INTC) reportedly swiped a third of Apple's (AAPL) iPhone 7 modems from Qualcomm (QCOM), benefiting Qorvo (QRVO) to the potential detriment of Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), but the U.K.'s decision to exit the European Union will slug all of them, Mizuho says.On Friday, Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh downgraded Skyworks and Qorvo stocks to neutral, matching his neutral rating on Qualcomm stock. He estimates that all three are 75% tied to the smartphone market, unlike radio-frequency chip competitor Broadcom (AVGO), which is 22% exposed.Also, RBC Capital analyst Amit Daryanani cut his price targets and estimates for chipmakers Analog Devices (ADI) and Texas Instruments (TXN), noting the likelihood of stalled IT spending, and industrial and automotive demand in the wake of Brexit.On the stock market today, Qorvo stock fell 1.4% and Qualcomm 1.1%. Broadcom, Skyworks and Texas Instruments were down 0.8%, 1.1% and 0.9%, respectively, while Analog Devices dipped 1 cent to 56.63 and Intel 0.15% to 32.75. Apple rose 0.3%.""While the iPhone 7 is ramping and our checks indicate (China smartphone maker) Huawei is comfortable with its 2016 outlook, the demand uncertainty combined with a seasonally weaker Samsung/China handset market makes for a challenging second half of the year,"" Rakesh wrote.That will impact Qorvo, Qualcomm and Skyworks to a greater degree than Broadcom, he wrote. Since merging with the former Avago, Broadcom has reduced its smartphone exposure, which had accounted for half of its revenue. That lower exposure will be key amid slowing smartphone sales.Rakesh suggested Skyworks tackle M&A again after its failed attempt to buy PMC-Sierra. He cut his price target on Skyworks stock to 68 from 99, but he said the company, a key Huawei supplier, could see strength as that company ramps its newest flagship.Meanwhile, he says, Intel's likelihood of taking 30% of the iPhone 7 mix will boost Qorvo ""given its legacy relationship"" in making chips compatible with Intel chips. And Qorvo will enjoy gains on better-than-expected strength in the Samsung Galaxy S7. Rakesh kept his 55 price target on Qorvo stock.RBC's Daryanani, in his separate report, said Apple likely accounts for 10% of revenue for Texas Instruments and Analog Devices. He cut his price target on Texas Instruments to 66 from 68, and cut his PT on Analog Devices to 63 from 65, to reflect Brexit's impact. But he kept an outperform rating on both stocks.""This could offset some softness in other markets,"" he wrote. ""While it is early to access any sizable impact from Brexit, we think it is prudent to adjust expectations for Europe.""Gartner estimates that global enterprise IT spending will rise 1.2% in 2016 vs. its earlier views for 1.6% growth, Daryanani pointed out, but in the U.K., IT spending will decline 1.5% vs. prior expectations for 1.7% growth. Europe's spending is expected to dive ""modestly.""In automotive chips, RBC sees North American production as flat and European production declining 1.4% in 2017 vs. earlier projections for 2% and 2.9% growth, Daryanani wrote.Texas Instruments' automotive sales have grown at an 11% four-year compound annual growth rate, while Analog Devices has had a 14% five-year CAGR. For both, investors should now expect single-digit growth, Daryanani wrote.

534,QCOM,"Wall Street split Friday on Intel's (INTC) shrouded PC future. At least one analyst hedged on Intel getting an Apple (AAPL) iPhone 7 chip win, as the No. 1 chipmaker prepares to unveil Q1 earnings after the close Tuesday.Intel stock was down a fraction in afternoon trading on the stock market today, near 32. Shares tanked 18% in January and early February on reports of more PC weakness, hitting a year-low 28.22 on Feb. 11. Since then, Intel stock has recovered 13%.For Q1, Intel is expected to report $13.86 billion in sales and 48 cents earnings per share, up a respective 8.5% and 17% from Q1 2015, per the consensus of 45 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters.Three months ago, Intel guided to $14 billion in sales, plus or minus $500 million.Pacific Crest analyst Michael McConnell and S&P Global Market Intelligence analyst Angelo Zino expect Intel to miss the midpoint of its guidance. And McConnell sees Intel cutting its full-year guidance. In January, Intel guided to mid- to high-single-digit sales growth over its $55.36 billion in 2015 sales.Zino notes, ""The PC landscape appears to be softer than originally anticipated.""MKM analyst Ian Ing acknowledged Intel's strong data center sales (about 30% of revenue) but expects Intel's PC weakness ""(to) more than offset strength in cloud computing.""He expects a flat Q2 for PC sales following a subseasonal Q1.But Zino sees Intel's year-over-year PC losses becoming less pronounced exiting 2016, despite a likely challenging first half. Industry trackers IDC and Gartner predicted 11.5% and 9.6% PC shipment declines in Q1.""We see an aging PC landscape (over 600 million devices more than five years old), market share gains and new innovative devices supporting CCG (client computing group) revenue as the year progress,"" Zino wrote in a research report.He reiterated his 39 price target on Intel stock. McConnell has a 35 price target and overweight rating on Intel stock. Ing maintained his buy rating but cut his price target to 38 from 40 on Intel stock.Intel has striven to get its chips inside the iPhone, and rumors recently circulated that Apple might tap the No. 1 chipmaker to source some of its iPhone 7 modems. Qualcomm (QCOM) has supplied the iPhone modem in the past four flagship smartphones.But Ing doubts that Apple would risk implementing an Intel chip. Teardowns show that Intel last supplied an iPhone chip in the 2008 iPhone 3G.""We retain some skepticism that Apple would add risk to their global launches,"" he wrote in a report.

535,QCOM,"Apple’s (AAPL) ""iPhone drag"" tugged Skyworks Solutions’ (SWKS) fiscal Q3 guidance by $50 million late Thursday, prompting shares of radio-frequency chip rivals Broadcom (AVGO) and Qorvo (QRVO) to topple Friday.Skyworks stock led a broad Apple chip sphere fall, falling 6.9% to 66.82 on the stock market today. Shares of competitors Broadcom and Qorvo were down a respective 1.5% and 1.75%.NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), Qualcomm (QCOM) and InvenSense (INVN) stocks followed, down 0.7%, 3.1% and 5.65%, respectively.Apple itself lost 1.15%, trading near its lowest levels since mid-2014.For its fiscal Q2, which ended April 1, Skyworks reported $775.1 million in sales and $1.25 earnings per share minus items, in line and topping the consensus of 25 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters for $775.6 million and $1.24.But EPS slipped to single-digit growth for the first time in 13 quarters, rising 9% year over year. Sales rose 2%, in the single-digit range for the first time in 14 quarters. Both metrics have decelerated for five consecutive quarters.Current-quarter guidance for $750 million in sales and $1.21 EPS ex items would be down 7% and 10%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier quarter. On a year-over-year basis, sales have never declined in the past five years. EPS has declined twice, but this quarter's decline would be the biggest.And both metrics lagged the consensus for $800.5 million and $1.32.Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh blamed the ""iPhone drag"" for Skyworks' weak guidance. On Tuesday, Apple reported its first year-over-year decline in iPhone sales and its first quarterly revenue drop in 13 years.Apple CEO Tim Cook said Tuesday that the company planned to cut channel inventories in the June quarter ""in light of the macroeconomic environment."" Late Tuesday, supplier Cirrus Logic (CRUS) offered Q3 guidance that also missed Wall Street views.But Skyworks expects a strong September quarter, with 20% and 40% content gains at Samsung and Huawei. On average, Chinese smartphones are growing content by 20% year over year, Rakesh wrote in a research report.Rakesh cut his price target on Skyworks stock to 99 from 105 but reiterated a buy rating.Cowen analyst Timothy Arcuri estimates that 40 million to 50 million iPhones will be sold in the June quarter, leading to better upside in Skyworks' fiscal Q4. But he adds that Qorvo might be a stronger RF competitor now.Both analysts suggest that Skyworks look to diversify amid the slowing Chinese and iPhone markets. Arcuri reduced his price target on Skyworks stock to 76 from 78 and kept his market perform rating.

536,QCOM,"Major stock ETFs closed mixed Wednesday as investors digested the Fed's action on rates, a raft of corporate earnings and choppy oil prices.Energy stocks contributed most to the benchmark S&P 500's gains. Technology trailed sectors.However, all three major semiconductor stock ETFs advanced despite a plunge for Apple (AAPL), a day after the tech giant reported its first-ever year-over-year decline in iPhone sales and its first quarterly revenue drop since 2003.In a conference call with analysts late Tuesday, Apple CEO Tim Cook had described the earnings miss as a blip -- a ""pause in our growth” -- but Wall Street wasn't having any of it. Apple stock tumbled more than 6% in massive volume, but closed in the top half of the day's range. The move erased billions in market cap.IShares PHLX Semiconductor (SOXX) added more than 1% on the stock market today, recovering from an intraday loss.The ETF holds 31 stocks, including several Apple chip suppliers.

538,QCOM,"Apple’s (APPL)  release of ‘revolutionary’ battery technology will drive an iPhone sales rebound in 2017, says a Morgan Stanley research report.“We believe Apple is working on revolutionary battery and charging technologies, which along with better displays, could drive the next upgrade cycle,” analyst Katy Huberty wrote in the report.While global smartphone sales remain tepid, Morgan Stanley says a rebound is in the cards. Besides Apple, it sees potential upside for Samsung, ARM Holdings (ARMH), Applied Materials (AMAT), ASML (ASML),  Broadcom (AVGO) and Qualcomm (QCOM).“Half of smartphone users point to battery life as the biggest source of dissatisfaction with their device, far greater than any other complaint,” Huberty wrote. “The combination of less power-hungry OLED screens, lower power consumption chips, and wireless charging technologies are likely to improve battery life significantly next year, driving upgrades much like larger screens did in 2015 for Apple and a couple years earlier for Android brands.”Morgan Stanley forecasts  smartphone unit growth of 6% in 2017 and 8% in 2018, compared with 3% both last year and in 2016.OLED (organic light-emitting diode) displays offer richer colors, darker blacks and consume less power than LCD displays, says the investment bank. OLED displays -- expected to become a mainstream smartphone feature starting next year -- also are super thin and flexible, allowing for new device designs.“Improved battery life and flexible OLED displays should drive another supercycle next year, helping shrink time to replacement and accelerate growth for the major smartphone makers,” said Huberty. “The combination of OLED, less power-hungry chips, and wireless charging help drastically extend the time between charging.”Apple stock fell 1.5% to 97.34 in the stock market today.

539,QCOM,"Apple (AAPL) deflated its iPad Pro but didn't skimp on the 9.7-inch machine's specs, according to an iFixit teardown that found NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) and Broadcom (AVGO) among the device's winners.But the second-generation iPad Pro, which Apple unveiled last month, only scored a 2 out of a best-possible 10 in repairability.Meanwhile, LG's flagship G5 scored an 8, featuring hardware from Qualcomm (QCOM), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Samsung. How healthy are Apple and its key chipmakers? Find out at IBD Stock CheckupApple ""went back to the drawing board"" in its smaller iPad Pro. NXP topped the chip count, providing three for the machine: the Touch ID second, a controller and a charging component.Two Broadcom chips returned from the 12.9-inch iPad Pro, and InvenSense (INVN) and Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM) both provided a chip apiece. Apple's A9 processor also made a repeat appearance.Samsung and SK Hynix provided RAM and flash memory chips, respectively.But iFixit was especially enamored by the LG G5, which separates itself from other flagship phones by offering an easily removed -- and therefore replaced -- battery. LG unveiled the device in February.Qualcomm topped the G5 with six chips, including the processor and two power management chips. The chipmaker also supplied charging, audio codec and LTE transceiver chips.Broadcom and Skyworks Solutions each provided two chips, leading NXP, which supplied a controller. LG tapped Samsung for both RAM and flash memory.On the stock market today, shares of Qualcomm and NXP 0.9% and 0.3%, respectively. Shares of Maxim and Broadcom both lost 0.35%, while Skyworks stock skidded 1.7%. Apple rose 0.3%.

540,QCOM,"Let's say you've mastered the art of spotting the cup and cup-with-handle patterns, and you're getting comfortable with the flat base and double bottom.Way to go. Those common base patterns, seen among the biggest stock market winners, are likely to come in handy. But there are other chart patterns that investors should familiarize themselves with.Today we'll focus on the ascending base, a rare pattern that can lead to big gains if you learn to spot it correctly and buy at the right time.The ascending base may be tougher to spot because it has more moving parts. The pattern often takes shape as a stock tries to rise during a choppy or tired market. But once a strong uptrend takes hold in the broader market, the stock has the potential to break out to new highs.An ascending base typically starts forming after a stock has already staged a prior breakout and gained at least 20% -- so it's usually not a first-stage pattern. As with other bases, you'd ideally see a strong prior advance on the stock's chart.So what does an ascending base look like? It consists of a series of three pullbacks, each ranging from about 10% to 20% from the most recent high to low. Each of the pullbacks must mark a higher high and a higher low -- thus, the ascending base.Because the pattern is created by three distinct pullbacks, it can take longer to form than most other bases, roughly 9 to 16 weeks.To get the buy point in an ascending base, add 10 cents to the high of the third pullback, like you would with other IBD patterns. Likewise, don't buy if it's extended more than 5% past the proper entry.Qualcomm (QCOM) went on a tear in the late 1990s. It soared nearly 300% after clearing a cup base in January 1999 to the week ended May 14, then pulled back to its 10-week moving average over the next two weeks. The stock found support at the line and continued higher before pausing in mid-July.It then staged a series of three pullbacks, in August, September and October, to shape an ascending base. Shares broke out past a 224.79 buy point in the week ended Nov. 5 in heavy volume, before taking off on a more-than-250% run to an early January 2000 peak.Ahead of the breakout, the chip designer carried high ratings: 99 Earnings Per Share, 99 Relative Price Strength, and B Accumulation/Distribution.

541,QCOM,"Stocks took a broad step higher Friday, giving the Nasdaq a narrow gap above its 200-day moving average.The S&P 500, Dow Jones industrial average and the Nasdaq climbed 0.8% each. Small-caps outpaced the general market, sending the Russell 2000 ahead 1.2%.The stock market today wrestled with mixed trade. Volume rose 7% on the NYSE, relative to action at the same time Thursday. But the Nasdaq's advance came in weak support, with volume slipping 7% below Thursday's morning levels.In economic news, the Commerce Department reported businesses saw wholesale inventories contract 0.5% in February. That was a faster decline than the 0.2% slip seen in January, and worse than the 0.2% decline expected by economist consensus.Oil futures accelerated their early advance, with West Texas intermediate surging more than 5% to above $39 a barrel. Prices may see some impact from the Baker Hughes (BHI) weekly rig count, due out at 1 p.m. ET.NRG Energy (NRG), Murphy Oil (MUR) and Chesapeake (CHK) were early gainers in the S&P 500.Nearly a third of the Dow stocks posted gains above 1%. American Express (AXP) topped the group with a 1.7% advance.NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) popped almost 3% to lead the Nasdaq 100. News reports said the Netherlands-based chipmaker was considering a sale of its standard products business, possibly to a Chinese buyer. Other chipmakers also boosted the Nasdaq, with Micron Technologies (MU) and Qualcomm (QCOM) each rising nearly 2%.Retail stocks were in motion, both good and bad.IBD 50 stock Ulta Beauty (ULTA) cracked a new high, jumping almost 4% in powerful trade. That put the stock out of buy range, more than 6% above a 188.58 cup base buy point. Ulta announced late Thursday it joins the S&P 500 index after the close of trade April 15.Gap (GPS) crumbled 11% in early trade. The apparel retailer reported late Thursday its March same-store-sales fell 6% compared with a 2% gain a year ago. Sales have now declined for 12 straight months.

542,QCOM,"Now that most companies have reported their latest quarterly earnings, let's see which IBD Dividend Leaders show the biggest dividend growth.The top three in Monday's IBD are all tech stocks, which are known more for investing heavily in research and development than for paying out dividends. But a few older tech names have become more recent entrants to the dividend-paying universe.Cisco Systems (CSCO) tops the list with 42% long-term growth in its cash payout. The San Jose-based chipmaker, which began paying dividends in 2011, reported fiscal Q2 earnings in February that topped views. It raised its payout by 24% to 26 cents a share, or $1.04 for the full year, which works out to a 3.9% yield. That's well ahead of the S&P 500's average 2.2% payout.Cisco's annual profit gains have slowed from the company's younger years, but they remain quite steady. Its three-year Earnings Stability Factor is 1 on a scale from 0 (most stable) to 99 (most volatile). Its three-year earnings growth rate is 5%. The stock is trading between its converged 10-week and 40-week moving average lines. It's been consolidating for nearly a year in a 26% deep, undefined pattern.Apple (AAPL) chip supplier Qualcomm (QCOM) comes in second with a 23% dividend growth rate. The San Diego-based company, which started paying dividends in 2003, offers a quarterly payout of 48 cents a share, or $1.92 annualized, for a 3.7% yield.Qualcomm shares rose the past three weeks, after having trended mostly lower since July 2014. They're now back above the 10-week moving average but still submerged 8% below the falling 40-week line.CA (CA) has been paying dividends regularly since 1990. The New York-based enterprise software maker pays 25 cents a share on a quarterly basis, for a 3.4% annualized yield. The stock has climbed back above its 10-week and 40-week lines and is 12% off its 52-week high. Shares have been consolidating for nearly 13 months.

543,QCOM,"Amid the sell-off in growth technology stocks in early 2016, Morgan Stanley still likes tech names with plenty of free cash, dividends, improving profit margins and rising market share.In a research report Wednesday, Morgan Stanley said its top tech picks include Comcast (CMCSA), T-Mobile US, Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon.com, Qualcomm (QCOM) and IBM. Morgan Stanley, though, is underweight on the technology sector overall, preferring utilities, financials and health care.“Relative to the broader market, we've seen more technology growth stocks with contracting multiples than any time in the last 10 years,” said analyst Adam Parker in the report.He also noted: “Since the (2008) financial crisis, technology stocks with improving margins have strongly outperformed those with high sales growth but no margin expansion.”Here’s what Morgan Stanley likes in some tech stocks:-- T-Mobile (TMUS). “Competition in the wireless industry is intense,” but T-Mobile continues gain share with its Uncarrier-branded promotions vs. rivals.-- Comcast. The cable TV firm has pricing power and invests wisely in broadband infrastructure and NBCUniversal, says Parker.-- Amazon (AMZN). Its “retail and cloud businesses are both inflecting ... which we see leading to higher than expected profitability,” wrote Parker.-- Microsoft. It’s getting a boost from “real top-line drivers,” says Parker, citing its Azure public cloud computing business, data center share gains and Office 365 subscriber growth and pricing.-- IBM (IBM). While IBM is the only large cap U.S. tech stock with institutional ownership at five-year lows, Parker says investors under-appreciate “an accelerating transformation to a more analytics- and cloud-friendly business.”-- Qualcomm. “We are overweight as we think recent concerns regarding the royalty and chip businesses are overblown,” said Parker, who expects improving licensing fees in China.

544,QCOM,"Will Verizon Communications (VZ) and Vodafone Group, one-time partners, be on different sides in the 5G wireless standards debate?Next-generation 5G services were a hot topic at last week's Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain. Vodafone (VOD) surfaced as a surprise member of a group of wireless phone companies aiming to meld two variants of LTE (long-term evolution) technology as a path to 5G. Those companies include China Mobile (CHL), India’s Bharti Airtel, South Korea's KT (KT), Japan’s SoftBank (SFTBY) and Vodafone. SoftBank controls U.S.-based Sprint (S).Verizon, on the other hand, said at the MWC that it will cooperate with Japan’s NTT Docomo (DCM), KT and SK Telecom on possibly different 5G specifications.Verizon in early 2014 bought out Vodafone’s 45% stake in their U.S. wireless joint venture, Verizon Wireless, for $130 billion.Two variants of LTE have existed in 4G networks worldwide. China Mobile, with the government’s backing, developed the “TD” variant, which stands for “time division” communications. Most of the world, including Verizon and Vodafone, used “FD,” or “frequency division” communications, in their networks, constructed starting in 2008.U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM) has intellectual property tied to the “FD” LTE variant.China’s government, meanwhile, has been keen on harmonizing the TD and FD variants, aiming to help companies such as Huawei sell network equipment and mobile phones abroad. In India and China, mobile phone makers have sold 4G devices that support multiple transmission modes.India's biggest wireless firm, Bharti Airtel, and Japan's SoftBank were earlier adopters of TD-LTE.Vodafone, meanwhile, has been working with Sweden-based telecom gear maker Ericsson (ERIC) and Huawei in some countries to meld the FD and TD technologies.At MWC, the five wireless firms -- China Mobile, Vodafone, Bharti, KT and SoftBank -- said they would support a five-year strategic plan to build a 5G “ecosystem” and converge the TD and FD technologies.Verizon, NTT and their partners, meanwhile, set technical trials for 2016 through 2018. Verizon’s 5G partners include Alcatel-Lucent (ALU), Ericsson, Cisco Systems (CSCO), Nokia (NOK), Qualcomm and Samsung.

545,QCOM,"In recent years, no industry has provided shareholder activists with as many opportunities to force changes -- or generate financial gains -- as technology.In its Shareholder Activism 2015 report issued last November, Moody's found that 33% of the 178 shareholder activism cases it had tracked through Oct. 15 of last year focused on tech firms, far more than any other industry.Tech firms, ironically, can blame their successes as well as their failures for their preferred status among shareholder activists. The sector's growth potential attracts the hedge funds and equity investors that are less inclined to sit docilely on the sidelines.""You really have to have a stomach for it,"" said Gerry Granovsky, an analyst at bond rating firm Moody's Investor Service. ""A lot of it is confrontational. You have to not be afraid to ruffle feathers.""Where many of the most famous shareholder activism cases have focused on poorly managed companies that represented turnaround opportunities -- which does include a fair number of tech companies, to be sure -- many tech firms instead have been targeted for not sharing their riches enough.Granovsky points out that as the tech sector has demonstrated historic stability over the past 10 years, it has enjoyed growing access to debt. Meanwhile, as scores of tech firms have grown into thriving global businesses, many have amassed massive amounts of cash overseas and have chosen to keep it there rather than pay U.S. tax rates.It's that cash, and companies' explanations for hording it, that often attracts the attention of shareholder activists more than anything.""Activists don't care about policies. They see Apple having $216 billion in cash,"" Granovsky said. ""To some extent they have a point.""The activities of shareholder activists do at least potentially benefit a larger group of stakeholders, and shareholder activists do function as a sort of corporate watchdog, so they have to be willing to get dirty for the cause.After finding itself on the receiving end of pressure from big-name shareholder activists Carl Icahn and David Einhorn, Apple (AAPL) has in the past couple of years been returning cash to shareholders in programmatic fashion.Similarly, persistent pressure from activists helped spur ATM maker NCR (NCR) to embark on an effort to buy back $1 billion worth of stock, funded by a deal with Blackstone that gives the financial advisory firm three seats on NCR's board -- a deal activist investor and NCR shareholder P. Schoenfeld Asset Management has questioned.Targeting excess cash is not a new shareholder activism strategy. In fact, it appears to have been one of the original strategies.In his just released book, ""Dear Chairman: Boardroom Battles and the Rise of Shareholder Activism,"" Jeff Gramm, a portfolio manager and adjunct professor at Columbia Business School, traces shareholder activism back to the 1920s. Gramm explores a 1927 case in which economist and investor Benjamin Graham, considered the father of value investing, led an effort to get Northern Pipeline to release some of its stockpile of unused cash back to its shareholders.That strategy has been used against tech firms to great effect in recent years, with a number of companies succumbing to similar pressures. And Granovsky says that trend might not peak until interest rates rise, causing tech firms to slow their borrowing and instead start tapping those overseas cash reserves.No worries. Even if all the cash-rich tech companies start giving back to shareholders, there are always underperformers to turn around.Despite the stability in the tech market Granovsky points to, there are plenty of tech companies that have found themselves in activists' cross-hairs for other reasons. In 2013, Microsoft (MSFT) granted its first board seat to an activist -- ValueAct Capital -- after facing widespread criticism for being a step behind a series of emerging tech trends such as cloud computing and mobility.Last year, Qualcomm (QCOM) launched a ""strategic realignment plan"" after activist hedge fund Jana Partners began pressuring the company to spin off its struggling chip business from its profitable licensing business. Also last year, eBay (EBAY) spun off PayPal (PYPL) after pressure to do so from several activists, led by Icahn, who argued that both companies would perform better if separated.More recently, Yahoo (YHOO) has been girding itself for a battle with one of its biggest shareholders, activist Starboard Value, as the Internet giant has been unable to forge much revenue growth in the past decade.Consider the case of Motorola Solutions (MSI). Shareholder activists have besieged the company since 2007, when its former entity, Motorola, was embroiled in a series of legal skirmishes over allegations the company had made misleading financial statements. (It eventually split into two companies in 2011, establishing Motorola Solutions as a communications provider, while it spun off the cellphone business into a separate company, Motorola Mobility, acquired by Google in 2011 and then sold to China's Lenovo in 2014.)Between 2007 and 2015, Motorola granted board seats to shareholder activists Icahn and ValueAct, and also to private-equity firm Silver Lake Partners.Shep Dunlap, an investor relations spokesman at Motorola Solutions, spoke with IBD about the company's experience with ValueAct, describing the relationship as ""generally collaborative"" and nothing like the contentious battles for which other shareholder activists, such as Icahn, have become known.""Their approach has been much more constructive with management rather than using the press and media as a mouthpiece,"" says Dunlap said.He says ValueAct's objectives have been aligned with Motorola's leadership from the get-go, and that ValueAct's guidance has helped streamline the company. In particular, he cites more than $550 million in costs removed since 2012, and $12 billion returned to shareholders, mostly through stock buybacks.""There's been a lot of progress in terms of optimizing our cost structure,"" Dunlap said. ""We're really a pure-play mission-critical communications company at this point.""Naturally, ValueAct has profited from the relationship, and today still owns 4.7% of the company's stock, a stake worth about $619 million based on the current valuation of $13.2 billion.Dunlap points to the fact that ValueAct has been a Motorola shareholder since 2011, longer than most activists stick around, as evidence of its commitment to the company's long-term health. He said not every activist is out to create a firestorm, cash out, and move on.""You have to keep an open mind when you're learning about an investor, whether it's an activist or not,"" he said. ""I think every company should use the feedback that's available to them from the investor community.""Its unlikely that the relationship has been as Pollyannaish as Dunlap paints it. Granovsky stopped short of describing shareholder activism as bullying, but was comfortable calling it intimidation.""Companies don’t want to deal with activists,"" he said.That said, there are times when they're a necessary evil if a company is to thrive, and Motorola may be an example of this.One thing is certain: Shareholder activists aren't going anywhere, and tech companies, and their piles of cash and occasional missteps, are clearly in their sights.

546,QCOM,"Stocks wobbled in and out of mixed territory Wednesday morning, as earnings news, a rising dollar and a pullback in oil prices combined to pressure equities.The Nasdaq managed a 0.1% gain and the Dow held just below the 0.1% mark. The S&P 500 struggled against narrow losses.The stock market today moved in quiet volume. Trade slowed 4% on the NYSE and was down 8% on the Nasdaq, vs. action at the same time Tuesday.Homebuilder stocks traded lower, despite a better-than-expected reading on existing-home sales for March. The National Association of Realtors reported sales rose to an annualized rate of 5.33 million, up from 5.07 million in February and above projections for a sales pace of 5.268 million.The Dow felt the pull of undertow from Boeing (BA) and Coca-Cola (KO). Boeing thumped out a 3% loss after Bank of America downgraded the stock to neutral from underperform. Coke shed nearly 4% after its Q1 earnings, and revenue fell slightly less than consensus forecasts, but weakness in international markets left volume flat.UnitedHealth Group (UNH) and American Express (AXP) led the index, up a bit more than 1% each.Check Point Software (CHKP) dropped 4% in heavy trade after earnings sneaked past consensus expectations, revenue just met views and management gave Q2 earnings guidance near the low end of the consensus range. The stock pared losses after finding support at its 50-day moving average. The dive cut 6% below an 88.08 buy point in a cup-with-handle base.Discover Financial (DFS) and St. Jude Medical (STJ) led the S&P 500, surging 7% and 4%, respectively, after healthy Q1 reports. Discover's powerful volume gain lifted it well up the right side of a five-month cup base, easily clearing its 200-day moving average and putting shares within 3% of a 58.18 buy point.St. Jude is up 25% from a mid-February low, but still below its 200-day line and deep in a nine-month consolidation.MaxLinear (MXL) topped the IBD 50 list by a wide margin, surging 7% after revising its Q1 revenue and gross profit outlook. The stock tripped a sell rule Tuesday, dropping more than 8% below a 17.85 buy point and cutting its 50-day moving average in heavy trade. Wednesday's gain brought shares back even with the 50-day line.A big after-hours session today is scheduled to include quarter reports from American Express, Qualcomm (QCOM), United Continental (UAL) and Yum Brands (YUM).

547,QCOM,"Verizon Communications (VZ) and AT&T (T) could shake up the U.S. residential broadband market by 2020 by deploying 5G wireless services to homes, challenging cable TV firms Comcast (CMCSA) and Charter Communications (CHTR), says Goldman Sachs.While 5G is expected to provide much faster data speeds, another market opportunity for AT&T, Verizon and T-Mobile US (TMUS) will be applications that require always-on, low-data-rate connections, says Goldman Sachs in a new research report. The apps involve data-gathering from industrial sensors, home appliances and other devices often referred to as part of the Internet of Things.Simona Jankowski, a Goldman Sachs analyst, says that some chipmakers, network gear suppliers and software companies will see an upside in 5G deployment. Jankowski says that Broadcom (AVGO),  Qualcomm (QCOM), Intel (INTC), Cisco Systems (CSCO), cell tower operator Crown Castle (CCI), and bandwidth service provider Zayo Group Holdings (ZAYO) could see upside from 5G deployment.“We expect pre-standard 5G commercial deployments to begin in the U.S. in 2017, when AT&T and Verizon plan to be first in the world to roll out fixed wireless 5G broadband to the home, followed by pre-standard 5G mobile networks in Korea in time for the 2018 Olympics,” wrote Jankowski in the report.U.S. regulators are focused on opening up high-frequency airwaves, also called millimeter wave spectrum, for 5G services.“Europe led the 3G transition, with industry giants such as Ericsson (ERIC) and Nokia (NOK) leading the way,” said Jankowski. “With 4G, the baton passed to the U.S., driven by a new group of industry leaders such as Qualcomm and Apple (AAPL). With China, Korea and Japan targeting 5G rollouts on par with or ahead of their Western counterparts, it bears watching whether the wireless industry’s center of gravity shifts once again (to Asia).”The Goldman Sachs analyst says that 5G also could have upside for Cisco, Intel, Zayo and Crown Castle.“We view Cisco’s market leading position in IoT as a strategic differentiator, given that 5G will likely be closely coupled with IoT,”  Jankowski added. “We expect Intel’s server and networking business to benefit from increased data traffic and greater demand for compute-intensive data analytics.“As the largest operator of small cell networks in the U.S. and one of the largest pure-play providers of dark fiber in large metros respectively, Crown Castle and Zayo look well positioned for this long-term investment cycle.”

548,QCOM,"Apple (AAPL) tapped No. 1 chipmaker Intel (INTC) to source some iPhone 7 modems, replacing incumbent Qualcomm (QCOM) in U.S. AT&T (T) versions and some overseas iterations, according to anonymous sources cited by Bloomberg.Smartphones sold by Verizon Communications (VZ) and in China will continue using Qualcomm parts, the sources said Friday. China remains an important mobile market despite reports last month that 97% of consumers own a smartphone.Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Intel representatives declined to comment ""on rumors and speculation."" Qualcomm also declined to respond. In April, Qualcomm CEO Steve Mollenkopf told analysts to expect a major customer to switch to multiple suppliers.Qualcomm's other major customer is Samsung, which has long used multiple suppliers. Dual sourcing of components gives a smartphone-maker better leverage for price negotiation. Apple tapped Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) and Samsung for its iPhone 6S processor.Intel's rumored iPhone modem win is a major victory for the chipmaker's struggling mobile unit. In 2014, Intel wracked up $4.2 billion in operating losses related to its mobile push. Last year, Intel had brought that down by nearly $1 billion. Now, it's targeting an $800 million reduction in losses.Despite its massive mobile efforts, Intel hasn't supplied an Apple iPhone chip since the 3G in 2008 -- although it frequently supplies chips for Macs -- while Qualcomm has provided multiple chips for each iPhone since the 4S unveiled in 2011.Qualcomm was the confirmed modem supplier in Apple's iPhone 5, according to iFixit.Qualcomm stock closed down 2.1% on the stock market today, while Intel stock buoyed 0.3% on the Apple rumor. Apple slid 0.8%.

550,QCOM,"The high tight flag is a rare pattern. It's often associated with vibrant companies with new products that can change the world.Stun gun company Taser International (TASR) formed the pattern in 2003. Tech innovator Qualcomm (QCOM) shaped the pattern in 1999. Birth-control pill maker Syntex did it in 1963. TV maker Zenith had the honors in 1958.See Full Series On Smart Chart ReadingAnd Bethlehem Steel, now defunct, raised the flag in 1915.What was new about steel? The company's grey rolling mill was revolutionary. Henry Grey's invention was installed at the plant in 1907-08. The beams produced from that plant were lighter, stronger and more economical than conventional riveted beams.The invention made skyscrapers possible.The high tight flag looks something like a skyscraper.The pattern forms when a stock surges 100% to 120% in four to eight weeks. The stock then corrects 10% to 25% in three to five weeks. The ideal buy point is the high of the flag plus 10 cents.Naive investors scoff at the high tight flag. They can't believe a stock can be a buy after doubling in price. Yet, an opportunity it is.""This is the strongest of patterns, but it's also very risky and difficult to interpret correctly. Many stocks can skyrocket 200% or more off this formation,"" IBD founder and Chairman William J.

Then it corrected about 20% over four weeks (2). The next breakout led to more than a 275% gain over 20 weeks.Three additional notes on Bethlehem Steel' s chart:First, notice how the big move came seven years after Bethlehem installed the new technology. True breakthroughs gain power and momentum over a long period. It's not like a fad that lasts a season or two.Second, note how Bethlehem thrived despite the pro-regulatory, anti-business climate of President Woodrow Wilson.

551,QCOM,"Ruckus Wireless (RKUS) could get a boost from increased spending on public Wi-Fi networks by cable TV companies as well as its push into a new market -- LTE wireless data services that use high-frequency 3.5 GHz spectrum, say analysts.Ruckus, a maker of Wi-Fi networking gear, competes with Cisco Systems (CSCO), Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), Aerohive Networks (HIVE) and others.Ruckus stock was up a fraction in midday trading on the stock market today, near 9.75, but it's down 9% this year after falling nearly 11% last year, amid a slowdown in education spending on wireless networks. Ruckus has a IBD Composite Rating of 70, where 99 is highest. Ruckus stock touched an all-time low of 7.25 on Feb. 10.On Friday, BTIG analyst Walt Piecyk initiated coverage on Ruckus with a buy rating.“We expect Ruckus to generate 16% revenue growth in 2016, an acceleration from last year’s 14% growth rate,” wrote Piecyk. “We expect 2017 revenue growth of 16% but note that if a cable operator were to initiate a new investment program, Ruckus would have the opportunity to accelerate the top line.”Ruckus sells Wi-Fi gear to the enterprise market -- big corporate, government, education and health system customers. One concern among analysts is its exposure to China’s telecom market.In late 2017, Ruckus could get a lift from a new product cycle, says Jason Ader, an analyst at William Blair. Ruckus is targeting in-building wireless networks that use 3.5 GHz spectrum, using a technology called OpenG.Ruckus is working on OpenG with Qualcomm (QCOM), Nokia (NOK) and Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Google.""Ruckus management is confident in driving adoption of OpenG over time and expects revenue impact in the second half of 2017,” wrote Ader in a research report. “We view the in-building cellular opportunity as an excellent strategic fit with Ruckus' existing business and a material growth catalyst longer term, especially as the Wi-Fi market matures.”

552,QCOM,"Regulators' decision to investigate Tsinghua Holdings' now-defunct $3.8 billion investment in Western Digital (WDC) could signal ""a heightened sense of scrutiny on all Chinese investments in U.S. technology,"" a Macquarie analyst wrote Tuesday.That's sure to frustrate Micron Technologies (MU) which, analysts say, could be examining a joint venture with a Chinese partner. Last year, Micron reportedly rebuffed a $23 billion bid from Tsinghua Holdings' chip-arm, Tsinghua Unigroup.MKM analyst Ian Ing says Micron could seek to become a ""local supplier"" for the Chinese memory market by entering a JV. A JV stands a better chance of getting approval from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.But the CFIUS is increasingly wary of Chinese investments in U.S. technology, Macquarie analyst Deepon Nag wrote in a research report. Tsinghua Unigroup plans to invest $47 billion to oust Apple (AAPL)-supplier Qualcomm (QCOM) from its No. 3 chipmaking slot.""We see increased risk that Chinese investment in U.S. semiconductor assets won't be allowed to take place, which we believe is an incremental negative for Micron,"" Nag wrote.Early Tuesday, Tsinghua Holdings subsidiary Unisplendour pulled its $3.8 billion funding in Western Digital after CFIUS regulators decided to investigate the investment. Nag sees little chance of IP theft in such a ""passive investment,"" but other analysts have suggested that Unisplendour was making a play for SanDisk's (SNDK) coveted Nand technology.Western Digital announced its plan to acquire SanDisk a month before Unisplendour was to invest the $3.8 billion for a 15% stake in Western Digital.""Tsinghua put $3.8 billion in Western Digital so they would have SanDisk technology,"" Summit Research analyst Srini Sundararajan told IBD in December. On Wednesday, Sundararajan said the Western Digital-SanDisk deal would proceed without Unisplendour.It's a marriage of ""necessity and convenience,"" he wrote in a report. Western Digital investor Alken Asset Management opposes the transaction, claiming the price is too high and SanDisk faces an uphill Nand battle, but the objection ""comes a bit late.""Toshiba and SanDisk have made rapid progress in 3D Nand, Sundararajan says. And SanDisk has ""gobs of Nand IP"" plus licensing sales to justify the price. Western Digital cut the price Tuesday after Unisplendour's exit to about $78.50 per share. Shareholders are set to vote on the transaction March 15. If it fails, Western Digital will have to pay a $184 million fee.""We find that net-net most of the objections expressed by Alken, while legitimate, ignore the strategic importance to Western Digital of having a captive Nand source as well as in-house Nand IP and a well-trained group of Nand experts,"" Sundararajan wrote.But Nag says the Unisplendour exit gives Western Digital the opportunity to reduce or completely drop the SanDisk deal. Out of 280 tech M&A deals in the past 30 years, nearly 10% were ultimately revised downward, he wrote.And considering Western Digital's slough in stock price -- down 43.5% since the deal was announced -- the acquisition will likely be dilutive, Nag wrote. On Tuesday, RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani estimated that the transaction would be 34% dilutive without the Unisplendour investment.""As a result, we believe that Western Digital will be highly motivated to renegotiate the price of SanDisk lower,"" Nag wrote.On the stock market today, SanDisk stock rebounded 4.9% to close at 69.90, after closing down 1.6% on Tuesday. Western Digital stock rose 2.7% vs. a 7.2% decline Tuesday.

553,QCOM,"Apple’s (AAPL) new iPhone SE probably has a gross profit margin of about 35% for the entry-level model, which is well below the mid-40% margins enjoyed by the rest of the iPhone family, RBC Capital Markets said in a research report Thursday.But the new phone, which starts at $399, will still give a lift to revenue and profit, RBC analyst Amit Daryanani said in the report.The iPhone SE could provide $6.8 billion in revenue and 23 cents in earnings per share this calendar year, assuming Apple sells an incremental 15 million units, Daryanani said.He reiterated his outperform rating on Apple stock, with a price target of 130. Apple was down a fraction, below 109, in morning trading on the stock market today.Based on teardown reports, the 16-gigabyte model iPhone SE has a bill of materials cost of about $260, Daryanani said. The 4-inch iPhone uses many of the same components found in the larger-screen, higher-priced iPhone 6 and 6S series phones.The iPhone SE likely benefited from cheaper components that were the result of Apple suppliers left with excess inventory after the iPhone 6S underperformed, he said.Chipmakers Qualcomm (QCOM) and Qorvo (QRVO) topped content in the iPhone SE, but Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Texas Instruments (TXN) gained new chips in the refreshed 4-inch smartphone, a Chipworks teardown found.The iPhone SE went on sale Thursday. It was a low-key product launch for Apple, with few stores seeing lines forming outside, Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster said in a report Thursday.Also, a check of 100 Apple stores in the U.S. found 90% availability for the iPhone SE, he said.“We view both the lack of lines and the high level of product availability as in line with expectations, reinforcing our view that the SE will be largely incremental to the model in replacing the low-end iPhone 5S,” Munster said.RELATED:Middle-Aged Apple Might Get A Sports Car, New Girlfriend.

556,QCOM,"Apple (AAPL) supplier Broadcom (AVGO) might begin ""pooling capital"" for acquisitions over the next six months to a year, Deutsche Bank analyst Ross Seymore said Monday in a research report following up on the No. 2 fabless chipmaker's Q2 earnings last week.Seymore boosted his price target on Broadcom stock to 200 from 180 and reiterated a buy rating. On Thursday, Broadcom topped analysts' Q2 views, as growth in wired infrastructure sales offset weak Apple iPhone sales.Broadcom stock closed up 0.2% on the stock market today. Shares hit an all-time high of 166 on Friday, up more than 10% for the year. Broadcom stock is now in a buy zone after forming a nearly eight-week cup on Thursday and breaking out from a 159.75 buy point on Friday. It's an IBD Leaderboard stock.Broadcom has executed ""superbly,"" Seymore wrote in his research report.""Broadcom was impacted by weakness at Apple and in HDD (hard disk drives), but this was more than offset by strength in wired, highlighting the diversity of Broadcom's multiple growth drives,"" he wrote.In Q3, Seymore is looking for 25% quarter-over-quarter growth in Broadcom's wireless segment, as Apple begins to ramp up its iPhone 7 in preparation for an expected September release. The wired business should post slight sequential growth, offset by enterprise storage and industrial declines.Broadcom is also quickly deleveraging following its merger with the former Avago earlier this year. In Q1, the former Avago bought Broadcom for $37 billion, keeping the Broadcom name and Avago stock ticker.During fiscal  Q2, Broadcom sold its wireless infrastructure unit to MaxLinear (MXL) and its Internet of Things segment to Cypress Semiconductor (CY). In the long term, Broadcom says, it will begin ""pooling capital in anticipation of future M&A"" when it reaches two times debt to EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization).Seymore sees that happening in the second half of 2016 or the first half of 2017. Broadcom and Qualcomm (QCOM) have been bounced around as potential bidders for Xilinx (XLNX). Cavium (CAVM) and Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM) are also often placed on the theoretical sales table.Seymore raised his view for Q3 earnings per share minus items to $2.78 from $2.58.

557,QCOM,"China's Tsinghua Holdings pulled its $3.8 billion investment in Western Digital (WDC) early Tuesday amid a U.S. government inquiry, prompting the disk drive maker to slash its already threatened bid for flash memory maker SanDisk (SNDK).The SanDisk acquisition, announced Oct. 21, will have to hurdle a Western Digital shareholder vote, which would not have been required with the investment by Tsinghua subsidiary Unisplendour.Western Digital stock sank 7.2% to 42.77 on the stock market today, while SanDisk stock lost 1.6% to 66.61.On Monday, Western Digital investor Alken Asset Management wrote an open letter claiming the $19 billion offer for SanDisk was ""simply too high."" SanDisk, an Apple (AAPL) supplier, faces competitive headwinds in 2016.Alken owns about 2% of Western Digital stock. The vote is slated for March 15. The Unisplendour investment would have given it a 15% stake in Western Digital.Unisplendour terminated its Western Digital investment after the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. said it would investigate. Neither Western Digital nor Unisplendour will pay a termination fee.In December, Summit Research analyst Srini Sundararajan told IBD that Tsinghua Holdings was trying to get its hands on SanDisk technology. Chip-arm Tsinghua Unigroup plans to invest $47 billion in semiconductor technology to become the world's No. 3 chipmaker, leapfrogging Qualcomm (QCOM).It wouldn't be the first time a Tsinghua Holdings bid for U.S. technology was shuttered on regulatory concerns. A rumored $23 billion bid for Micron Technologies (MU) by Tsinghua Unigroup seemingly fell flat last year on worries that CFIUS would stop the deal. Micron shares fell 5.1% to 10.49.By terminating its Western Digital investment, Unisplendour triggered an alternative deal between Western Digital and SanDisk. Western Digital will now pay $67.50 per share in cash and 0.2387 in stock for SanDisk, for a value near $78.50 per share at Western Digital's Monday closing price. The original deal valued SanDisk at 86.50 a share.Despite the failed Unisplendour bid, the demand for data storage is rising, Western Digital CEO Steve Milligan said Tuesday in a statement. By acquiring SanDisk, Western Digital would get easy access to Nand (flash memory).""We believe the strategic rationale of this acquisition is even more compelling today than when we first announced it in October last year, given industry trends and strong execution by both companies,"" Milligan said in the statement.The SanDisk deal has been expected to close in Q2. Western Digital said it continues to see $500 million in synergies within 19 months of the closure and $1.1 billion by 2020. If the deal fails, Western Digital must pay SanDisk $184 million.RBC analyst Amit Daryanani sees the Western Digital-SanDisk deal being 34% dilutive without the Unisplendour investment. The ongoing shift to 3D Nand has pressured average sales prices for SanDisk's bread-and-butter Nand business, he wrote in a research report.""While we think the long-term rationale of owning HDD (hard disk drive) and Nand under one umbrella is logical, the near-term implications of this could be negative,"" he wrote.Needham analyst Richard Kugele notes the $17 billion debt that Western Digital will incur if it acquires SanDisk. But a partnership with Toshiba via SanDisk could buoy Western Digital. Toshiba manufactures SanDisk's Nand.""Nothing will change the aggressive nature of the Nand industry, but partially owning a fab through the Toshiba partnership should help Western Digital over time navigate those waters,"" Kugele wrote in a research report.Daryanani rates Western Digital stock outperform and has a 68 price target. Kugele rates Western Digital stock a strong buy and has a 90 price target.

558,QCOM,"MaxLinear Inc., a cable and communications chipmaker whose numbers surged with new products and acquisitions in 2015, is poised for ongoing growth as the global semiconductor sector gets ready to start expanding again this year.Analysts are particularly bullish on MaxLinear (MXL) because the company generated strong growth last year, even as the chip industry broadly, but modestly, lost ground.After a banner 2014, global chip sales declined 0.2% in 2015, the Semiconductor Industry Association said. But MaxLinear's revenue more than doubled. Though a good portion of that was due to acquisitions, the company said growth was broad-based and spanned its various customer segments in several parts of the world.""(MaxLinear) benefits from the adoption of fatter data pipes to the home to satisfy consumer demand for higher Internet bandwidth and cable/satellite TV capabilities,"" analyst Krishna Shankar of Roth Capital Partners said in a February report.Chip sales dipped last year as recessionary fears gripped parts of Europe, as well as emerging markets such as Brazil and parts of Asia. Economic growth in China, while still relatively robust, slowed in 2015.But the Semiconductor Industry Association projects global growth in the year ahead, as demand from customers for faster and more convenient products continues to mount.Citing World Semiconductor Trade Statistics data, Dan Rosso, deputy director at the Semiconductor Industry Association, told IBD the group sees ""modest"" growth this year of 1.4%. That would lift chip sales above 2014's record, in which sales rose 9.9% to $335.8 billion.Rosso said that, if global economic growth were to gain significant momentum this year -- or falter substantially -- that likely would have a direct impact on chip sales.""Semiconductors continue to be more heavily integrated into a broad range of products and markets, so if global GDP is growing -- and particularly consumer spending -- it bodes well for semiconductor market growth as well,"" he said.Either way, Carlsbad, Calif.-based MaxLinear is poised to capitalize. The company makes communications and video display chips that are used by cable and satellite television operators, telecommunications companies and network equipment providers, among others.In China, the world's most heavily populated country and one where millions of residents are annually plugging into or expanding their use of digital products, infrastructure upgrades also proved to be particularly fertile ground for MaxLinear in 2015. Overall, chip sales there grew 7.7%, while declining in most of the rest of the world.MaxLinear also benefited notably from its April 2015 acquisition of Entropic Communications. It paid $287 million in cash and stock for the target, which develops chips for the cable and satellite TV market.In February, MaxLinear posted fourth-quarter 2015 adjusted earnings of 46 cents per share, up from 40 cents the previous quarter and 5 cents a year earlier. The fourth-quarter result was 3 cents ahead of the consensus estimate.Revenue of $98.9 million was up 4% sequentially and up more than 200% from a year earlier. The sequential growth during the quarter was driven by double-digit organic sales growth from cable, satellite and other operators, which account for about three-fourths of sales. The surge in year-over-year revenue was fueled by the acquisition.MaxLinear Chairman and Chief Executive Kishore Seendripu, who declined an interview request, said during the company's earnings call with analysts in February that the integration of Entropic was ""largely complete"" and should continue to drive expansion this year.""Our combined expanded portfolio of market-leading broadband access and connectivity solutions makes us strategically relevant to operators globally,"" Seendripu said. ""We are in a strong position to address the key challenges faced by our operator partners, namely delivering higher bandwidth into and distributing richer multimedia content throughout the home.""For the full year, adjusted earnings soared 297% to $1.27 a share on sales that were up 126% to $300 million.MaxLinear has forecast first-quarter revenue of $100 million to $105 million. The company ""is executing well with high-quality growth drivers,"" Deutsche Bank analyst Ross Seymore said in a February report.Ranked No. 1 in IBD's Electric-Semiconductor Fabless group, MaxLinear leads the sector with Composite and Earnings-Per-Share ratings of 99. Its stock is up more than 100% over the past 52 weeks. All eight analysts who cover the company give it either an ""outperform"" or ""buy"" rating, according to Thomson Reuters.Others in the Fabless group include Qualcomm (QCOM), Nvidia (NVDA), Broadcom (AVGO) and ARM Holdings (ARMH)MaxLinear, which makes about 200 products, continues to steadily expand its offerings. In January, for example, it unveiled a new platform for data gateways -- technology that connects to multiple data sources and provides a single point of access to connect to each device -- which are increasingly in demand as consumers seek out both speed and convenience.The data gateway market ""continues to be an exciting and strategic growth platform for us,"" Seendripu said on the earnings call. He expects major cable operators to boost shipments of MaxLinear's new platform in the second half of this year.""We believe that this upgrade cycle will generate solid revenue growth over the next several years,"" he said.MaxLinear has been taking advantage of constant, though slowing, growth in China. Even though the country's economy slowed last year as China transitions from an industrial-dominated society to a more diverse, tech-driven one, it is still growing and is expected to continue to do so throughout this year, at twice the rate of U.S. GDP expansion or more, Raymond James chief economist Scott Brown told IBD.While chip sales grew 7.7% there, China's GDP expanded by 6.9% in 2015, lower than the 7.3% posted the previous year, according to Trading Economics. Weaker manufacturing and exports brought the rate down, but growth persisted on consumer demand for new products and services.""We are talking about slower growth but certainly not no growth,"" Brown said of China. ""They are still improving on a lot of fronts, particularly with a lot of the demand for new technology.""And that demand should manifest in the form of continued strong build-up in technology infrastructure and chip sales.""It should hold up,"" Brown said, ""given that the modernization of their economy should continue for quite some time.""

559,QCOM,"Federal regulators appear set to go forward this spring with the auction of airwaves now owned by local TV broadcasters, but other spectrum-related developments loom as wild cards that could increase supply, thereby impacting wireless industry competition and M&As.Those other developments include the contract award for FirstNet, the federal government's plan to create a nationwide wireless broadband network dedicated to public safety; the re-emergence of LightSquared, renamed Ligado Networks, from Chapter 11; and whether wireless firms succeed in lobbying to use commercial LTE technology in unlicensed spectrum now allocated to Wi-Fi.The Federal Communications Commission still plans to begin the “Broadcast Incentive Auction” on March 29. The auction, which could last five to six months, will free up an estimated 60 megahertz to 80 MHz of prime, low-frequency radio spectrum for wireless services.Results of the spectrum auction could affect the competitive future of IBD Leaderboard company AT&T (T), which has seen accelerating growth in recent quarters, and rival Verizon Communications (VZ) -- a member of IBD’s Big Cap 20 -- as well as highly rated Comcast (CMCSA). AT&T and Verizon are expected to buy TV airwaves in the auction, and cable leader Comcast also will likely bid, say analysts. Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Google has ruled itself out.AT&T and Verizon own more than 70% of low-frequency airwaves in the top 100 U.S. markets. Low-frequency airwaves travel over long distances and can pass through walls, improving in-building services.The FCC will impose a ""quiet period"" that bans negotiation over spectrum until the auction is over. Satellite TV broadcaster Dish Network (DISH) has acquired some 75 MHz of midband spectrum -- which covers a little less territory than low-frequency spectrum -- but it lacks a wireless network partner and is in limbo until the auction ends, analysts say. Dish has filed to bid in the auction, but observers are uncertain that it will.The auction's outcome could well raise or lower the odds of some major deals, long rumored in the industry:-- that Comcast will acquire a wireless services provider;-- that a cable TV leader will strike an alliance with Verizon;-- that Verizon will enter into a spectrum-leasing deal with Dish;-- that Dish and T-Mobile will merge.But even beyond the auction, by early 2017, further developments involving the FirstNet contract, Ligado, unlicensed-LTE and satellite wireless firm Globalstar (GSAT) could impact Dish’s plans, as well as the spectrum strategies of AT&T, Verizon and T-Mobile. That’s because all these elements provide alternatives for network capacity, aside from the auction.Here’s a run-down of several scenarios:-- FirstNet. Whoever wins this first-responder contract would need to invest in network infrastructure. Congress has set aside 20 MHz of spectrum -- a wide swath of the airwaves -- in the ""D block"" of the 700 MHz frequency band for the public safety network.The winning bidder is expected to enter into a lease agreement with the FirstNet authority for access to the 20 MHz of prime airwaves. While the FirstNet public safety network would be prioritized for emergency responders, the winning bidder would also be able to use the spectrum for commercial purposes and consumer services.The government will award the FirstNet contract after the TV airwave auction ends, if the government's timetable proceeds as planned. Verizon has been viewed as the front-runner, but AT&T has made clear that it’s interested. T-Mobile (TMUS) could bid but faces long odds vs. AT&T and Verizon, analysts say.-- LTE-U. Verizon and T-Mobile have been biggest proponents of developing a technical standard that would allow 4G LTE commercial technology to use unlicensed spectrum. Google, Microsoft (MSFT) and the Wi-Fi Alliance, which certifies Wi-Fi network gear, have lobbied the FCC to protect unlicensed airwaves, saying that interference could impair Wi-Fi services. Apple (AAPL), a Wi-Fi Alliance member, has not said anything publicly.Verizon and AT&T claim that no special LTE-U equipment certification is needed as long as devices meet certain basic FCC rules for unlicensed spectrum. Chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM) has been backing LTE-U deployment. The FCC in February allowed Qualcomm to move ahead with LTE-U testing at two Verizon facilities to demonstrate that the technology would not interfere with Wi-Fi. Qualcomm and the Wi-Fi Alliance have been working on “coexistence” plans.The cable TV industry has a big stake in the outcome, analysts say, because Comcast, Charter Communications (CHTR) and others have been expanding public Wi-Fi networks. While Verizon has targeted 3.5 GHz spectrum in the near term, it could try to carry out LTE-U in higher 5 GHz airwaves that cable TV firms covet.If LTE-U gets a green light, the Apple iPhone and other devices could support the technology by 2018.-- LightSquared, now Ligado. Former Verizon Chairman and CEO Ivan Seidenberg is chairman of Ligado, while former FCC Chairman Reed Hundt is a board member.Ligado, controlled by private equity firms, has a sizable 35 MHz of midband spectrum. After emerging from bankruptcy, Ligado reached agreements with tractor maker Deere (DE) and GPS device maker Garmin (GRMN), resolving issues over potential global positioning system interference. While Ligado might provide services to industries such as energy or transport, or pursue next-generation 5G services, it could sell the airwaves as well.The company hasn’t spelled out its new business model, analysts say, and it’s still awaiting some FCC approvals to use the spectrum for commercial purposes.-- Globalstar.  The FCC has been studying Globalstar’s petition to use airwaves in the midfrequency 2.4 GHz block for wireless services. The Wi-Fi Alliance and other groups have opposed Globalstar’s plans, citing possible interference issues. Globalstar could lease capacity to a wireless firm or an Internet company if it wins at the FCC. Globalstar’s stock, though, has plunged about 50% in the past year to near 1.40 while its FCC approval has languished.Image provided by Shutterstock.

560,QCOM,"Chipmakers Qualcomm (QCOM) and Qorvo (QRVO) topped content in Apple’s (AAPL) newly launched iPhone SE, but Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Texas Instruments (TXN) gained new chips in the 4-inch smartphone, a Chipworks teardown found Thursday.Apple's iPhone SE is ""the most powerful 4-inch phone ever,"" the smartphone giant says. It was unveiled March 21 and began shipping today, the same day Tesla Motors (TSLA) began taking orders for its less expensive Model 3.Researchers with Chipworks and iFixit classified the iPhone SE, the first to not have a number in its name, as the iPhone 6S squeezed into the iPhone 5S body.""There are very few new parts, but that hardly means there is no innovation,"" Chipworks wrote. But Apple engaged in ""serious economical re-use"" of many radio-frequency (RF) chips, excepting the Skyworks and Texas Instruments additions.New to the iPhone SE, Skyworks gained a power amplifier module and Texas Instruments earned a power management chip. Privately-held Toshiba and Epcos made new appearances with a flash-memory chip and an antenna switch module.A new power management chip could also be an Apple-Dialog Semiconductor mash-up, Chipworks wrote.Qualcomm and Qorvo each have four chips in the phone, leading Skyworks, which contributed three iPhone SE chips. Broadcom (AVGO) and Cirrus Logic (CRUS) each supplied two chips. Texas Instruments, NXP Semiconductor (NXPI) and InvenSense (INVN) all brought one apiece to the table.The A9 processor was supplied by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM), in this particular phone. But Apple dual-sourced the A9 in the iPhone 6S, splitting share between Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung.Samsung reportedly has since said that it would yield the A10 processor to Taiwan Semiconductor. The A10 processor is scheduled to make its debut in the iPhone 7, likely to be launched in September.

561,QCOM,"Starbucks (SBUX) and Juniper Networks (JNPR) got their ratings downgraded and price targets cut early Tuesday, while analysts cut their price targets on Alcoa (AA) and Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX), while raising them on a pair of Apple (AAPL) chipmakers.Starbucks fell 2.3% to 59.50 on the stock market today after Deutsche Bank downgraded the coffee chain to hold from buy and cut its PT to 64 from 70 ""due to modestly decelerating sales/earnings trends."" Deutsche Bank cited Starbucks' revised loyalty program as one headwind.IBD's Take: How healthy are the shares of Starbucks and its rivals? Find out at IBD Stock CheckupJuniper Networks fell 7.35% to 23,06. UBS downgraded Juniper to neutral and cut its price target to 25 from 31, saying the networking firm's weak preliminary Q1 figures late Monday signals weak enterprise demand.Alcoa lost 2.7% to 9.48 Tuesday as Stifel Nicolaus cut its PT to 13 from 14 after the Aluminum giant said late Monday that weak aluminum prices impacted earnings and that it would cut up to 2,000 jobs.RBC Capital Markets cut its PT on embattled Valeant Pharmaceuticals to 65 from 69, a day after the drugmaker's board urged CEO Michael Pearson to comply with a congressional subpoena following his no-show at an earlier hearing. Valeant's pricing practices are being reviewed by the government. Valeant fell initially but turned up 2% to 31.99.On the tech front, Mizuho raised its price targets on Apple chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM) and radio frequency player Qorvo (QRVO). Qualcomm's went to 49 from 47 with a neutral rating -- still below Monday's close at 51. It raised Qorvo's PT to 55 from 50, with a buy.  Qualcomm fell 0.35% to 50.82 and Qorvo 0.65% to 47.68.Apple rose 1.3% to 110.44. Apple once again closed just below its 200-day moving average. The iPhone maker hasn't closed above that level since early October.Meanwhile, FBR Capital raised its PT on cloud software firm Adobe Systems (ADBE) to 115 from 100. Adobe rose 0.5% to 93.42.Credit Suisse took action on a host of airline stocks. It cut its PT on United Continental (UAL) to 69 from 80 and cut American Air Lines Group (AAL) to 49 from 57.

562,QCOM,"Apple (AAPL), Samsung and other smartphone makers will need more advanced chips and antenna components as wireless service providers combine multiple radio-frequency bands to improve network capacity and data speeds, says a Citigroup report.AT&T (T), Verizon Communications (VZ)and Sprint (S) are among the wireless firms turning to “carrier aggregation,” a term for combining two or more frequency bands to provide a single communications channel with more bandwidth.This juggling act requires more complex radio frequency chips, says Citigroup. It forecasts a growing market opportunity for chipmakers Qualcomm (QCOM), Broadcom (AVGO), Skyworks Solutions (SWKS),  Qorvo (QRVO), Murata and others.Wireless firms are using carrier aggregation as mobile video traffic surges.  “Carrier aggregation is like adding more lanes to widen the highway and creating more space for more cars to travel on the highway at the same time,” says the report.While Apple designs its own antennas, there’s still a market opportunity for Amphenol and AAC Technologies to supply China-based smartphone brands, says Citigroup.Apple’s iPhone 6S series supports 23 frequency bands and the number is expected to keep growing in future devices, says Citigroup. Xiaomi’s new Mi 5 supports carrier aggregation to double its data download speeds, says the report.In the U.S., AT&T was the first to move to carrier aggregation for 4G LTE-A network upgrades, followed by Sprint and Verizon, analysts say.“According to Cisco (CSCO) (Systems), mobile data traffic is expected to grow more than 50% in the next five years,” said Citigroup. It expects more “world” phones to be built, with the ability to roam on 4G LTE networks as subscribers travel.

Walt Disney's (DIS) Lucasfilm ILMxLAB and Magic Leap announced a partnership Thursday at a Wired conference, teasing audiences with a mixed-reality video in which R2-D2 and C-3PO appear to be physically present in the room and fervently discussing how to escape a group of stormtroopers.Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google and Qualcomm (QCOM) were early investors in Magic Leap.Virtual reality and mixed reality (the latter layers projections on top of the real world) are still in early days, but legacy media entities clearly aren't hesitating to jump in. Disney also became an investor last year in cinematic VR company Jaunt VR, which consists of several Lucasfilm vets.Meanwhile, Chris Milk, the co-founder of VR startup Within (nee Vrse) announced Thursday — along with the name change — that the company was closing a Series A round of funding led by Andreessen Horowitz. 21st Century Fox (FOXA) also participated.Other notable media money in VR includes Comcast (CMCSA) and Time Warner's (TWX) investment units, which both participated in NextVR's $30.5 million Series A funding round last year.Does this mean that there are more partnership announcements to come? Maybe. VR is already a hot topic in gaming.At E3 2016 this week, virtual reality was a dominant theme. Microsoft (MSFT) teased its VR-capable Project Scorpio console, while Sony (SNE) gave PlayStation VR a formal release date, and Facebook's (FB) Oculus announced the release of 30 full VR games later this year.Shares of Disney finished 0.6% higher on the stock market today.

564,QCOM,"Broadcom (AVGO) CEO Hock Tan hinted Thursday at Apple's (AAPL) ""imminent"" recovery, thanks to its iPhone 7 ramp, MKM analyst Ing Ing said Friday after Tan guided to 20% sequential wireless growth in the July quarter and increased content in the 7 vs. the iPhone 6S.Sales of Apple's iPhone 6S have largely disappointed. In April, Apple reported its first year-over-year decline in iPhone sales. The July quarter will be ""a very different picture,"" Tan told analysts Thursday during the company's Q2 earnings conference call.A ""large North American customer"" -- widely assumed to be Apple -- is ramping up its next flagship smartphone with a ""substantial"" increase in Broadcom content, Tan said on the call. That will likely increase again in October, he said.IBD Take: Broadcom ranks No. 7 in its big group. Find out why at IBD Stock Checkup.""A strong Apple smartphone cycle appears imminent,"" Ing wrote in a research report Friday as he boosted his price target on Broadcom stock to 188 from 162. Ing reiterated his buy rating on Broadcom stock.Ing was one of at least 16 analysts Friday to boost their price targets on Broadcom stock following the company's fiscal Q2 earnings report late Thursday. Broadcom stock gapped up to a record high of 166 early on the stock market today, and shares were up nearly 5%, to 162.56 at the close.Radio-frequency competitors Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Qorvo (QRVO) stocks also lifted early Friday, though Qorvo was down a fraction in morning trading. Broadcom's fiscal Q3 guidance topped the consensus, and it posted a hefty 15-cent Q2 earnings beat on better-than-expected post-Avago merger synergies.Late Thursday, Broadcom reported $792 million in wireless sales, up 38% vs. the year-earlier quarter but missing guidance for $820 million. Wired infrastructure sales soared 440% to $2.06 billion. Enterprise storage and industrial sales came in at $525 million and $182 million, up 12% and down 17%, respectively. Broadcom's Tomahawk switches drove blowout wired revenue, Craig-Hallum analyst Anthony Stoss said Friday.Stoss maintained his buy rating and 200 price target on Broadcom stock, and he sees Broadcom growing its iPhone 7 content by 30% vs. the iPhone 6S, potentially offsetting the possibility of another dip in iPhone unit shipments.Investors are missing the runway on RF chipmakers, Stoss wrote in a research report.""We expect at least several more years of additional content gains due to more bands, carrier aggregation and additional RF filters,"" he wrote. ""We believe the expected launch of 5G in 2020 will only add to the content gains and RF flexibility.""He also expects Broadcom's appetite for M&A might be growing. Broadcom paid off $565 million of debt in Q2 and expects to pay $1 billion in Q3 with cash from divestitures, such as the sale of its Internet of Things unit to Cypress Semiconductor (CY).Analysts have posited Broadcom could make a play for small chipmaker Xilinx (XLNX). Fellow Apple supplier Qualcomm (QCOM) has also been thrown into the hypothetical Xilinx bidder mix. In 2015, chip sector M&A topped $115 billion.""We believe Broadcom will be in a position to make an additional acquisition or two by the end of this calendar year,"" Stoss wrote. ""Broadcom has demonstrated the ability to extract substantial value and reap the benefits of scale through accretive acquisitions.""
"
565,QCOM,"Apple (AAPL) iPhone supplier Broadcom (AVGO) is quickly deleveraging and might pursue M&A before year's end, MKM analyst Ian Ing said Friday, days after Broadcom's name was again thrown into the theoretical bidder hat for Xilinx (XLNX).Xilinx stock rose by 5.7% Tuesday on rumors that it had received a $15 billion bid from an unidentified source. Apple suppliers Qualcomm (QCOM) and Broadcom are often rumored suitors, but Cowen analyst Timothy Arcuri sees NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) as a better target for Qualcomm.""The Broadcom story largely revolves around a quick deleverage and return to semiconductor consolidation via accretive deals, possibly by calendar year 2016 exit,"" Ing wrote Friday in a research report.Recently, Broadcom tucked-in 5G modulation firm MagnaCom, in a $50 million acquisition. It also sold its Internet of Things unit to Cypress Semiconductor (CY) to ""help reduce debt and monetize"" its discontinued operations, Ing wrote.After the market close Thursday, Broadcom is slated to report its first quarterly earnings results following its January merger with Avago. The former Avago bought classic Broadcom for $37 billion, keeping the Broadcom name and AVGO stock ticker.For its fiscal Q2 ended on or near April 30, Broadcom is expected to report $3.55 billion in sales and $2.38 earnings per share ex items, up a respective 116% and 12% vs. the year-earlier quarter. EPS will slightly accelerate from 8% growth in the prior quarter but won't hit December 2015 levels.Long term, Broadcom and other chips combos are at risk of Apple's penchant for sourcing from suppliers ""that have an easier path to full integration,"" Ing wrote. Broadcom is about 14% exposed to Apple, providing some $4-$5 of content per iPhone.""Apple's second-sourcing of modem chips via Intel (INTC) may be an interim step toward full integration centered around the (Apple) Ax-series applications processor,"" Ing wrote. Intel is more open to implementing third-party apps processor IP than is Qualcomm, he says.""An Apple single-chip integration comparable to Qualcomm's Snapdragon would save package, test and assembly costs as well as power consumption,"" Ing wrote.It wouldn't be the first time that Apple has used dual component suppliers. The iPhone 6S contained A9 processors from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) and Samsung.Samsung reportedly yielded to Taiwan Semi for the iPhone 7 processor.Broadcom stock rose a fraction Friday, to 153.30, and IBD's 41-company Electronic-Semiconductor Fabless industry group also rose a fraction.

Rowe Price Growth Stock (PRGFX) is still way off its late-2015 high (it's down 10.36% this year going into Tuesday), like a lot of growth-oriented mutual funds. So what's the fund doing to position itself for the future and to resume the outperformance charted by helmsman Joe Fath since he took the tiller a little more than two years ago?After becoming manager in early 2014 and then reshaping the portfolio to reflect his strategy, Fath guided the fund to a 10.85% gain in 2015. That topped 96% of its large-cap growth rival mutual funds tracked by Morningstar Inc. Its peer group averaged a 3.60% gain. The S&P 500 edged up 1.38%.It will be increasingly hard to find growth in 2016, Fath said in his year-end commentary. Durable growers will be crucial to good performance.

571,QCOM,"Intel's (INTC) dogged mobile pursuit -- to the tune of ""billions of dollars"" lost -- will pay off with an Apple (AAPL) iPhone 7 modem chip, a Barclays analyst wrote Monday as he downgraded modem rival Qualcomm (QCOM).Radio-frequency systems supplier Qorvo (QRVO) wins in the Intel model, scooping rival Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), Barclays analyst Blayne Curtis wrote in a research report. But Intel's Apple iPhone share will likely be a minority, with 10%-20%, as a second source.The No. 1 chipmaker Intel hasn't been used in an iPhone since the 2008 3G iteration. Apple last dual-sourced a key component -- the processor -- in the iPhone 6S, pitting Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) against Samsung.Samsung has since backed off the A10 processor, yielding to Taiwan Semiconductor, analysts say.Midday on the stock market today, Qualcomm stock was down more than 1.5%, while shares of Intel and Apple were little changed. Skyworks stock was up 0.8%, while Qorvo stock was down 0.4%.Figuring on 20% share of the iPhone 7, Intel would add 3 cents earnings per share ex items per quarter vs. a 13-cent Qualcomm decline, Curtis wrote. Curtis downgraded Qualcomm stock to equal weight from sector weight and cut his price target to 50 from 55.""We clearly underestimated Intel's ability to lose billions of dollars in this pursuit of mobile, but we also thought Qualcomm would make a larger effort to monetize the modem business it still has,"" Curtis wrote.Qualcomm likely won't be able to innovate back to 100% share of the iPhone modem business, Curtis wrote. Its faster modem, the Snapdragon 820, comes with a lower average sales price and higher costs.""If Qualcomm can't fix that problem, then this would be bad business for both companies unfortunately,"" Curtis wrote.On the radio-frequency side, Qorvo wins in the Intel model, gaining 3% share vs. its iPhone 6S offerings, he wrote. In an 80%/20% Qualcomm-Intel split, Qorvo gets a pair of power amplifiers and the envelope tracking chip, undercutting Skyworks.Curtis forecasts Qorvo's iPhone 7 share to rise 3% to $4.92 vs. $4.80 in the iPhone 6S. He boosted his price target on Qorvo stock to 50 from 46.But even at 50% penetration for Intel, which he calls unlikely, Skyworks still gains share, Curtis wrote. At the 80%/20% split, he expects Skyworks' iPhone 7 chip content to rise as much as 20% to $6.82 per phone, up from $5.69 in the 6s.Curtis sees Broadcom's (AVGO) contribution growing 27% in the iPhone 7 to $8.05 worth of content, vs. $6.35 in iPhone 6S. A three-year supply agreement between Broadcom and Apple will likely leave Qorvo, Skyworks and Japan's Murata Manufacturing scrambling for share, he wrote.
"
572,QCOM,"No. 1 chipmaker Intel (INTC) remains in the running for an Apple (AAPL) iPhone 7 chip even as the smartphone-maker's iPad Pro continues to gouge PC sales, a Summit Research analyst said Tuesday.Financially, gaining the iPhone 7 modem would be a ""non-event,"" accounting for $200 million in sales and 2 cents earnings per share ex items per quarter, Summit Research analyst Srini Sundararajan wrote in a research report.But it would allow Intel to undercut No. 3 rival Qualcomm which, teardowns show, has supplied the iPhone modem in at least the past four flagship iterations. Qualcomm has been an iPhone supplier since iPhone 4S, whereas Intel last supplied a chip in the iPhone 3G, circa 2008.""The implications from a prestige point of view -- getting a socket into the iPhone, is likely to be seen as an achievement for Intel and a loss for Qualcomm,"" Sundararajan wrote.In midday trading on the stock market today, Intel stock was down a fraction following the death of former longtime CEO Andrew Grove, 79, a Silicon Valley and tech visionary largely credited with building the company into a powerhouse. He left as CEO in 1998 and left the board in 2004 -- both moves precipitated by health issues -- but remained an advisor.Sundararajan cut his price target on Intel stock to 38 from 40 on ""PC doldrums,"" but reiterated his buy rating. Sundararajan is the third analyst since February to cut his Q1 estimates for Intel on the weakening PC unit.Taiwanese PC shipments were ""dreadful"" in January and ""so-so"" in February, Sundararajan wrote. And ""Apple's release of the smaller iPad Pro and iPad Pro earlier should continue to cut incrementally into PC sales.""But Sundararajan doesn't expect Intel to pre-announce new guidance. Intel previously guided to $14.1 billion in sales, plus or minus $500 million, suggesting 52 cents EPS ex items. That would be up 10% and 27%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier quarter.""To a certain extent, we feel that Intel's mentioning weakness in China was an accurate presaging of what was to come, so we do not think that Intel's guidance is likely to be that far off from actual results,"" he wrote.Sundararajan cut his Q1 views to $13.8 billion and 45 cents vs. earlier expectations for $14.3 billion and 53 cents. He notes that Intel anticipates about $400 million in revenue from its completed Altera acquisition and an extra-week bump.The consensus of 46 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters models $13.96 billion in Q1 sales and 49 cents EPS minus items, up a respective 9% and 20%, on a year-over-year basis.For the year, Sundararajan now sees $57.9 billion in sales and $2.35 EPS minus items, down from $59.9 billion and $2.50. On average, analysts expect $58.77 billion and $2.40, up 6% and 3% vs. the year earlier.

573,QCOM,"The current art of virtual reality looks like a kid’s toy compared to technology by Magic Leap, which has just received nearly $800 million in a funding round led by Alibaba (BABA).The Florida-based company has not revealed the technology used to create its stunning video images, such as a whale leaping out of nowhere and splash landing on a high-school auditorium floor.“Absolutely not VR,” said a Magic Leap spokesman in an email exchange with IBD. “We are developing Mixed Reality.”In an interview with the Financial Times, Magic Leap co-founder and CEO Rony Abovitz, described the technology as a new kind of “hyper-personal computing” that seamlessly mixes rich digital graphics with the physical world.In the newest funding round, totaling $793.5 million, investors besides Alibaba include the venture capital arm of Qualcomm (QCOM) and Alphabet (GOOGL), through its Google unit, as well as Warner Bros. and Fidelity Management, among others.“We invest in forward-thinking innovative companies like Magic Leap that are developing leading products and technologies,” Joe Tsai, executive vice chairman at Alibaba, said in a statement announcing the funding round. “We believe Alibaba can both provide support and learn from such a partner.”Google, before it became a unit of Alphabet, was a prior investor in Magic Leap. It led a $542 million funding round in Magic Leap in October 2014. Qualcomm was also an investor.The latest investment by Alibaba, Google and others comes as Facebook (FB) is betting big on its Oculus Rift virtual reality headset. Facebook priced the headset at $600 and is expected to begin shipping next month.In an interview with The Wall Street Journal in 2014, Abovitz said he sees Magic Leap as a new interface that could replace the PC monitors and smartphone screens that define the modern era of computing. The article said the first product in development by Magic Leaps “is a mobile and wearable device for the eyes, with the hardware and software designed by Magic Leap.”At its core, said the article, Magic Leap’s technology can project images onto the eyes, making it possible to see virtual 3-D objects as if they were part of the real world. Abovitz told the WSJ that it tricks the mind into believing that virtual objects are actually part of the physical space.In announcing the new funding round, Abovitz said “we are creating a new world where digital and physical realities seamlessly blend together to enable amazing new experience.”

575,QCOM,"The Delaware Select Growth Fund (DVEAX) pulls out all the stops in its search for growth.The go-anywhere fund invests in companies of all sizes, and looks for names that are expected to grow faster than the U.S. economy over the long term. With $688 million in assets, the fund is sub-advised by a team of managers from San Francisco-based Jackson Square Partners.Year-to-date going into Tuesday, the fund is down 5.8% vs. an average decline of 3.4% from its peer large growth funds tracked by Morningstar. Over the last decade though, Delaware Select Growth has churned out an annual average return of 7.1% vs. 6.6% from the large growth category.The fund held 69 stocks as of Feb. 29, spread across varying market cap categories. By the fund's count, technology, consumer discretionary and health care are its top three weightings. The fund has an annual turnover rate of 46% versus 65% for its category average. Delaware Select Growth primarily bets on U.S. companies with 38% of its assets invested in its top 10 holdings.PayPal (PYPL) was one of those top holdings, and one of the fund's better recent performers.  The digital and mobile payments provider is up 14% so far this year. The stock was a top holding as of Feb. 29. Earnings per share rose 7%, 14%, 29% and 24% the past four quarter.Vital SignsAt the end of February, the fund's top holding was the biopharmaceutical company Celgene (CELG).  In January, the company reported fourth-quarter earnings per share growth of 17% on a 23% jump in revenue. Celgene’s top line has benefited from strong sales from its top-selling cancer drug, Revlimid.Shares of Celgene are down 16% year-to-date. Earlier this month, the biotech released drug-trial data that disappointed investors. Celgene reported phase-three disappointing results for apremilast, its experimental oral treatment for psoriasis.Delaware Select’s No. 2 position has also been making gains in the pharmaceutical space. Allergan (AGN) is coming off an impressive Q4 of its own. Botox was the company’s top revenue generator at $460 million for the quarter. The figure amounted to 13.1% of total revenue. In November, the company agreed to a blockbuster merger with Pfizer (PFE).Allergan has seen its stock price slide 12.2% since the beginning of the year. EPS growth has decelerated, growing 180%, 65% and 33% the past three quarters.Qualcomm (QCOM) was the fund’s third-largest holding and has been in the portfolio since 2005. The Delaware Select Growth team stated in its Q4 commentary that it believes the company’s mobile chip business will bounce back from 2015 ""product cycle issues that are unlikely to recur."" In a show of strength, the company recently upped its dividend by 10%.Qualcomm has seen its stock price rise 4.4% in 2016.Zebra Technologies (ZBRA) was added to the Delaware Select Growth portfolio in 2014. The company sells tracking and computer printing technologies such as barcode scanners and specialty printers. Zebra recently said it is projecting full year net sales growth of 1% to 4% for 2016. It also expects to pay down at least $300 million in debt principal.Zebra shares have declined 1.6% so far this year.In its Q4 commentary, the Delaware Select Growth team noted progress by Microsoft (MSFT), a top holding, in its shift towards cloud-based technology. ""We believe this transition should be beneficial as its software could be better utilized across multiple platforms,"" the team wrote.Shares of Microsoft have ticked down 2.9% so far this year.

586,QCOM,"Tesla Motors’ (TSLA) poaching of key Apple (AAPL) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) engineers could squeeze graphics-chips partner Nvidia (NVDA), an MKM analyst wrote Monday ahead of Nvidia's April 5 analyst day.But MKM analyst Ian Ing reiterated his buy rating and 39 price target on Nvidia stock, which was up 1% in afternoon trading on the stock market today, earlier touching an eight-year high at 34.98.Nvidia and Tesla have partnered in machine-learning -- widely seen as key to autonomous driving -- for the better part of a decade. Last year, Nvidia's automotive segment grew 80% -- to $320 million in revenue.Together, the duo faces stiff autonomous-driving competition from rivals like General Motors (GM), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Apple. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has famously called Apple the ""Tesla graveyard,""  saying Apple has hired engineers that Tesla had fired, but recent reports indicate that Tesla might be swiping Apple and AMD engineers.Still, Ing says those engineers aren't as steeped in graphics processing units and machine learning as Nvidia's staff.""Although there are widely reportedly headlines that Tesla has been hiring chip architects from Apple and AMD, we note that expertise has been focused more on multi-purpose application processors vs. the GPU accelerators necessary for machine learning,"" Ing wrote.Nvidia stock rocketed 35% over the past month, recovering from a five-month low of 24.75, hit Feb. 12. On Feb. 17, Nvidia reported record Q4 and 2015 sales that easily topped Wall Street expectations.Core gaming brought in 58% of Nvidia's January-quarter sales, but the chipmaker also has a bright future in virtual reality, self-driving cars, autonomous drones and cloud data center acceleration, Ing wrote.And a recent data center wave featuring Qualcomm (QCOM), Intel (INTC), Broadcom (AVGO), Integrated Device Technology (IDTI) and Inphi (IPHI) will likely lift Nvidia's tide as well, Ing wrote. Last month, Nvidia noted its alliances with Chinese Internet major Alibaba (BABA) and Facebook (FB) for speedy artificial-intelligence chips.This year, Google joined Facebook's Open Computer Project, which aims to lower the cost of data center ownership. Google also announced a beta ""cloud machine learning"" service that lets users customize machine learning, ahead of Amazon (AMZN) Web Service and Microsoft (MSFT) Azure.Image provided by Shutterstock.

587,QCOM,"Opinions vary about what a leader looks like in the stock market.For example, watch the financial news on TV and you’ll see a steady flow of market pundits calling Intel (INTC) a leader in the chip space, or Cisco Systems (CSCO) a leader in the networking space. Truth is, they are not true stock market leaders anymore. Yes, they have big, well-known brands -- and they’re still widely held by fund managers -- but both are struggling to hold onto market share as new names emerge.IBD’s definition of a leader -- the L in CAN SLIM -- is fairly straightforward. For starters, the stock needs to be showing relative price strength in the market -- going up in price, not down. Stocks near 52-week highs are leaders, not stocks near 52-week lows.Leaders also have outstanding earnings and sales growth and are taking market share from the competition. They’re typically newer companies, although older, large-cap names can sometimes fit the bill as long as they successfully adapt to fast-changing industry conditions.Leaders also share something else in common. Their uptrends are being fueled by institutional buying from mutual funds, banks and other institutional investors, whose buying power have the most impact on a stock’s upward move.Daily and weekly stock screens throughout IBD cast the spotlight on leading stocks. Some are large-cap, liquid names, but the majority of screens house lesser-known, yet compelling names with leadership traits. Weekly screens include Your Weekly Review in Friday's IBD. It lists top-rated stocks throughout IBD’s 197 industry group rankings. Every Tuesday, the Big Cap 20 presents large-cap names with leadership traits.Daily screens include Sector Leaders, Stock Spotlight, Income Investor and World Stocks.The accompanying table highlights some emerging chip designers in the fabless semiconductor space. Qualcomm (QCOM) owns the biggest market capitalization in the group at $78 billion. It is still mentioned as a leader in the group but with an IBD Composite Rating of 59, it’s not a leader anymore.Broadcom (AVGO) is the second-largest stock in the group. Its recent merger with Avago has stirred some excitement on Wall Street, fueling strong price performance in recent weeks. A Composite Rating of 97 points toward a stock with leadership traits.Meanwhile, newer names with innovative new products have emerged. They include MaxLinear (MXL), Inphi (IPHI), Silicon Motion Technology (SIMO) and Mellanox Technologies (MLNX).Leadership also applies to industry groups and sectors. A stock may have the look of a leader, but if it’s not a member of a top-performing group or sector, meaningful gains could be tough to achieve.Use the industry group rankings -- found every day in the print edition's B section, on the page labeled ""What’s The Market Trend?"" -- to keep track of leading groups in the market. Gold miners have been outperforming recently.To find the leaders in the group, go to IBD Stock Checkup and enter the ticker symbol for any gold stock, and you’ll immediately see who the top-five stocks are in the group based on their Composite Rating.IBD’s stock tables, meanwhile, are all about leadership as well. The tables are arranged by sector strength to keep your attention focused on leading stocks in leading sectors.

588,QCOM,"Inphi (IPHI) and Microsoft's (MSFT) 100-gigabit ""drone"" -- likely to rival infrastructures by Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB) and Amazon.com (AMZN) -- earned chipmaker Inphi at least three price-target hikes Wednesday, as shares rocketed to a record high.Midday on the stock market today, Inphi shares were up more than 6%, near 32.50, after earlier flying as much as nearly 8% to an all-time high above 33. Shares outperformed a lazy Wall Street on Wednesday that saw the S&P 500, Nasdaq composite and Dow Jones industrial average all down.Deutsche Bank analyst Ross Seymore upgraded Inphi stock to a buy rating from hold and upped his price target to 40 from 30, acknowledging the pricey entry point. Analysts with Northland and Stifel Nicolaus boosted their price targets on Inphi stock to 36 from 31, and to 40 from 38, respectively.""We have long acknowledged Inphi's solid execution and technology position but have maintained a hold rating awaiting an opportunistic entry point,"" Seymore wrote in a research report. But ""the size and diversity of the growth drivers the company is addressing are too compelling to ignore.""On Tuesday, Inphi unveiled its 100G ""drone,"" capable of connecting multiple data centers within 80 kilometers (about 50 miles). The current industry solution is for a much slower 10G platform, says Jeff Cox, Microsoft senior director of network architecture.Microsoft sought out Inphi in 2013 to solve its data center problem, Cox told IBD. The 100G ""long-haul"" solution was too costly, power-consumptive and required excess space for metropolitan data transfers. But the 10G ""drone"" solution wasn't fast enough.So the duo developed ColorZ, which is an industry first, according to Inphi CEO Ford Tamer. ColorZ is slated to deploy in Q3. Seymore expects Microsoft to account for 5% of Inphi's Q4 and 2017 sales.The new product will drive growth, Seymore wrote. Linking data centers to amass cloud size -- and speed -- is becoming increasingly necessary. Cloud users like Apple, Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon and Facebook have all expanded their online operations, Cox said.Chipmakers such as Intel (INTC), Qualcomm (QCOM), Broadcom (AVGO), Nvidia (NVDA) and Integrated Device Technology (IDTI) have redoubled their data-center efforts in the past year to increase share. But Tamer says they're at least 18 months behind Inphi.Seymore increased his 2016 estimates for Inphi to $300 million in sales and $1.37 earnings per share ex items, up 34% and 33%, respectively, vs. 2015 metrics. For 2017, he now expects $370 million and $1.70.The consensus of 12 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters forecasts $290.7 million and $1.26 for 2016, and $357.7 million and $1.62 for 2017.

589,QCOM,"Buybacks stormed back into the news last week, with Bank of America (BAC) and JP Morgan Chase (JPM) announcing they will return more capital to shareholders ahead of their annual stress tests.That perhaps reassured buyback ETF investors, as doubts grow about whether the trend has legs.In 2015, S&P 500 companies spent $572.2 billion on buybacks, up 3.4% from the previous year, according to new data by S&P Dow Jones Indices. Total shareholder return for those companies, including dividends and buybacks, in 2015 set a 12-month record, at $954.6 billion.""The report of buybacks' death was greatly exaggerated,” Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, said in a press statement accompanying the data release.For companies, buybacks -- like dividends -- are a way to keep investors happy. Reducing the number of outstanding shares in a company drives up stock prices. And it's easy to do at a time when corporate cash hoards are growing and borrowing costs are near record lows.However, Silverblatt's research noted that S&P 500 buybacks actually ticked down 3% in Q4 over the previous quarter, to $145.9 billion. Some strategists argue that buybacks are no longer fueling share prices the way they did in the past.That seems to be true, as seen through the prism of exchange traded funds tracking buyback firms.SPDR S&P 500 Buyback (SPYB), which follows an index of the top 100 stocks with the highest buyback ratios in the S&P 500, tumbled 7.2% in the year ended March 22. By comparison, SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) slipped 0.7%.However, buyback ETFs have outperformed the S&P 500 over the longer term.PowerShares Buyback Achievers (PKW), the largest ETF in its segment, produced an annual average 13.4% gain over the past five years vs. 11.9% for SPY. SPYB does not have a three- or five-year history.PKW holds $1.77 billion in assets and tracks an index of U.S. companies that repurchased at least 5% of their outstanding shares in the previous 12 months.In theory, buyback ETFs give investors exposure to quality businesses. Companies buying back their own shares tend to have healthy bottom lines. The top three holdings out of 233 in the PKW portfolio are McDonald’s (MCD), Boeing (BA) and Qualcomm (QCOM).The ETF has been outgunned year-to-date, and over the past two and three years, by a smaller and newer actively managed peer.AdvisorShares TrimTabs Float Shrink (TTFS) invests in buyback companies while adding free cash flow and leverage screens. That helps it filter out low-quality stocks.""We try to find companies that don't finance buybacks with debt,"" said Ted Theodore, portfolio manager of TTFS.With rates poised to rise, Theodore believes many companies using debt for share buybacks may not have the ability to keep doing that.""Our companies do. They have good organic growth to them, not just financial engineering,"" he added, referring to criticism that buybacks can give share prices an artificial boost.TTFS holds 100 equal-weighted stocks, including Apple (AAPL). The iPhone maker spent $37.1 billion on share repurchases in 2015, helping the technology sector dominate S&P 500 buybacks.The ETF is up 3.3% year to date. It has averaged a 13.6% annual gain over the past three years vs. 11.8% for SPY.

590,QCOM,"Netflix (NFLX) was downgraded Friday, while Boeing (BA) and Twitter (TWTR) got lower price targets and Pandora Media (P) was upgraded amid buyout rumors that could involve Facebook (FB).FBR Capital downgraded Netflix to market perform from outperform and lowered its price target on the stock to 100 from 125, citing risks to its outlook. On Thursday, reports said Netflix completed the shift of its streaming service to Amazon’s (AMZN) public cloud and that it shut down its last data center.Shares of Netflix settled 1.2% higher on the stock market today. Amazon’s stock price rose 0.65%%.Twitter jumped 11% to 15.88 despite having its price target slashed to 24 from 45 at Argus. On Wednesday, Twitter said user growth slowed for the fourth straight quarter and guided Q1 revenue below consensus estimates, raising concerns that usage may be peaking.Shares of Pandora sank 12% after it was upgraded to outperform from market perform at FBR Capital. On Thursday, Pandora reported a fourth-quarter earnings miss amid a decline in its active listener base.The streaming music leader is in a heated battle with rivals that include Apple (AAPL), Amazon and Google owner Alphabet (GOOGL). Reports also surfaced that Pandora could be a buyout target, with Facebook and Amazon among the potential suitors.Apple’s stock price rose 0.3% Friday. Facebook and Alphabet added 0.1%.Boeing’s price target was lowered to 128 from 135 at RBC Capital Markets, which has a sector perform rating on the stock. The aerospace giant’s shares were up 0.2%, after a tumble Thursday on reports of a Securities and Exchange Commission accounting probe.Qualcomm (QCOM) got a pair of price target cuts — to 60 from 62 at Cowen and to 47 from 51 at Mizuho. Shares rose 3.6% to 44.56.FireEye's (FEYE) price target was lowered to 30 from 40 at Topeka Capital Markets, which rates the stock a buy. After Thursday’s close, the security software firm fell short of Q4 revenue views. Shares fell 3.3%.

591,QCOM,"Cirrus Logic (CRUS) stock rocketed Thursday on rumors that Apple's (AAPL) iPhone 7 could include a set of noise-cancelling headphones -- a move that could drive sales growth above the 15% in fiscal 2017 the audio chipmaker has forecast. ""There are definitely people considering putting that (noise-cancelling headphones) in the box,"" CEO Jason Rhode said in the company's earnings conference…

592,QCOM,"With its soaring growth, Facebook (FB) may soon take steps to ease its tax burden, according to a Morgan Stanley report.And, Morgan Stanley says, Facebook is one of a list of technology and pharmaceutical companies that could gain if Congress creates a “patent box” as part of corporate tax reform.Other companies that would benefit from a patent box, also called an ""innovation box,"" would be Qualcomm (QCOM), chip maker Xilinx (XLNX), as well as drug companies Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN), says the report.A patent box provides lower tax rates on royalty income generated from licensing. Intellectual property can include patents, trademarks, designs and logos.On Qualcomm, Morgan Stanley noted: “The IP licensing business is conducted almost entirely in the United States, and as such, we believe it generally pays near full corporate taxes.”Shares in Facebook jumped 16% by early afternoon in the stock market today, after the social networking giant late Wednesday said Q4 revenue jumped 52% from a year earlier to $5.84 billion.“In 2015, we estimate that around 51% of Facebook’s revenue will be generated internationally. Despite this fact, we estimate that Facebook will have (an approximate) 34% adjusted tax rate in 2015 (very close to the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35%). Going forward, Facebook may take steps to reduce its tax burden,” the Morgan Stanley report said.Congress could pass legislation overhauling corporate taxes, it said.Senators Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y) and Rob Portman (R-OH) have proposed tax reform aimed at “tax inversion” deals, in which companies relocate headquarters to a lower-tax nation, usually following an acquisition.“A patent or innovation box might be the United States' best means to combat inversions and remain competitive with other countries,” said the Morgan Stanley report.Supporters say a patent box would also help keep research and development in the U.S.

593,QCOM,"A new U.S. export ban against Chinese mobile gear maker ZTE related to its under-the-table sales to Iran could hurt Apple (AAPL) chip suppliers Qualcomm (QCOM), Qorvo (QRVO) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), a Pacific Crest analyst wrote Wednesday.Regulators imposed the sanctions Tuesday, alleging that ZTE used four shell companies in China and Iran to ""illicitly re-export controlled items to Iran in violation of U.S. export control laws."" The ban prohibits U.S. companies from selling to ZTE.Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi opposed the sanctions, saying that ZTE's tech purchases support thousands of U.S. jobs, according to the AP. Chipmakers Cavium (CAVM), Integrated Device Technology (IDTI), Silicon Laboratories (SLAB) and Xilinx (XLNX) also sell to ZTE.""This approach will only hurt others without necessarily benefiting oneself,"" Yi said at a new conference Tuesday.ZTE isn't banned from selling products in the U.S. but cannot procure components from U.S. companies. U.S. firms can apply for an export license, but Pacific Crest analyst John Vinh sees the government unlikely to grant them.The development could shuffle the smartphone market. ZTE owns about 4% of the global smartphone market, Vinh wrote. Industry tracker IDC says that ZTE competes alongside Xiaomi and Huawei in the low-end to midrange smartphone market, vs. No. 1 smartphone vendor Samsung.Vinh expects short-term effects on chipmakers to be ""negligible."" Longer term, he says that ZTE could lose share to Huawei, Ericsson (ERIC), Alcatel-Lucent (ALU), Nokia (NOK), Siemens (SIEGY), Xiaomi, Oppo and Lenovo.""Alternatively, ZTE could conform to the U.S. embargo list, which could result in sanctions being lifted,"" he wrote.Xilinx is most at risk, with 3%-3.5% of total revenue stemming from sales to ZTE, Vinh estimates. Silicon Labs follows with 2%-2.5% of total revenue wrapped in ZTE sales.IDT, Qualcomm and Qorvo are each 2% tied to ZTE, Cavium 1%-2%, and about 1.5% of Skyworks' sales stem from the Chinese smartphone maker.Wall Street largely yawned Wednesday, however. Midday on the stock market today, only Qualcomm stock was down, dipping a fraction. Cavium stock was up a fraction. Shares of Qorvo, Silicon Labs, Skyworks and Xilinx were all up more than 1%. Integrated Device Technology stock was up more than 2.5%.

594,QCOM,"Sales of Xiaomi’s new Mi 5 popped in China this week, ahead of Apple’s (AAPL) expected launch of the less pricey, 4-inch-screen iPhone SE in the spring.Shares in Qualcomm (QCOM), whose Snapdragon 820 processor is built into the Mi 5, lifted more than 1% in the stock market today. Apple stock was down about 0.5% in afternoon trading.Xiaomi said that it had nearly 17 million registrations in hand for the Mi 5 on March 1, the first day of sale in China, though only one-fourth as many devices were reportedly ready for shipment.Xiaomi was the top smartphone seller in China in Q4, with 15% market share, followed closely by Huawei, with Apple in third place. Even though Apple’s December-quarter revenue growth slowed  year-over-year, overall iPhone demand was one reason why Xiaomi missed its 2015 smartphone shipment target, says research firm IHS.While Apple is apparently going small in China and emerging markets, the flagship Mi 5 has a 5.15-in. display that may help Xiaomi promote a new multiperson video chat feature vs. Apple’s FaceTime.At the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in February, Xiaomi said that it would license U.S.-based  Vidyo’s conferencing technology for an app pre-installed on the Mi 5. The app is also available free on iOS and Android devices.“Scale is crucial for all communications apps, and Xiaomi’s plans to launch the app on Google Play and iOS illustrate this,” said Jack Kent, an IHS analyst, in an email.""Mi Video"" supports multipoint videoconferencing, while users of Apple’s FaceTime can video chat with only one other person.While the Mi Video app may give Xiaomi a boost, “there could still be concerns about how much data video calling consumes -- users on limited mobile data plans or pay as you go services may not be keen to use such services,” added Kent.At Forrester Research, analysts say that Xiaomi may have challenges.“China's mobile connectivity has been slow, and videoconferencing can be taxing on a network,” Forrester analysts said in a blog post on the video app.However, analysts agree that Xiaomi aims to set itself apart with more features aside from pricing its hardware aggressively, especially if it plans to expand globally.“Xiaomi needs to do more with its software ecosystem to significantly grow its business beyond its home market of China,” says an IHS report. That’s where Xiaomi’s partnership with Qualcomm could help.The new Mi 5 is priced  at roughly $300 and $350 with 32 GB or 64 GB of data storage.Xiaomi still garners more than 90% of its sales in China, though demand is growing in India and Indonesia. Xiaomi still doesn’t sell mobile phones in Europe or the U.S.China’s slowing economy is a worry for its local smartphone makers as well as Apple. Apple’s December-quarter sales in China rose only 14% from the year-earlier quarter, down from 99% growth the preceding quarter.The iPhone SE will sell for $400 to $500, said one report.Samsung, meanwhile, was pushed out of the top five smartphone sellers in the December quarter, says Strategy Analytics.

595,QCOM,"Tech giant Microsoft (MSFT) and chipmaker Inphi (IPHI) plan to leave Apple (AAPL), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Alphabet (GOOGL) in their drone dust come Q3 ... digitally speaking.Early Tuesday, the companies introduced a 100-gigabit platform capable of digitally tying multiple data centers within 80 kilometers (about 50 miles). Previously, that breakneck 100G speed was possible only in cross-country networks.Linking data centers to amass cloud size -- and speed -- will become more necessary as cloud users like Facebook (FB), Alibaba (BABA), Yahoo (YHOO) and others expand their online footprint, says Jeff Cox, Microsoft senior director of network architecture.Microsoft realized as much in 2012, but the industry's ""long-haul solution"" for cross-country information transit was too hefty for use in metropolitan areas, Cox says. It would be the travel equivalent of launching a Boeing 777 to go from John Wayne Airport near Anaheim, Calif., to Los Angeles International Airport 20 miles away.""You'd take a cab, not a 777,"" he told IBD. ""For those distances across town, we want these large quantities, but that's the wrong approach.""In 2013, Microsoft and Inphi teamed up to solve the problem. Inphi moves data in the same way FedEx (FDX) transports packages -- by trains, planes and trucks, Inphi CEO Ford Tamer told IBD. The Microsoft-Inphi solution is a 100G ""drone.""Inphi also has a 100G long-haul solution under its Coherent platform. But the Coherent platform is more power-consumptive, expensive and requires space to allow excess heat to dissipate, Cox says. He estimates the Coherent platform uses 20 times more power than the new Inphi-Microsoft platform.""Using the Coherent technology would blow your entire power budget,"" he said. ""It's fairly impractical at this scale.""Enter Colorz.Microsoft and Inphi's partnership will be borne out in the Colorz platform -- faster than the industry's current 10G drones and less costly than 100G long-hauls, Tamer says. The 100G drones are capable of moving the digital equivalent of the Library of Congress multiple times in one second.""We do not believe there is any other solution that can achieve what we've done in the power and cost envelope,"" Tamer said. ""For that type of power and that type of performance and that distance, we do believe it's an industry first.""Three years ago, Microsoft met brick walls as it sought to reach 100G inside city limits, Cox said. He referenced tech lore when, in 1981, company co-founder Bill Gates asked who would need more than 640 kilobytes, in defense of IBM's (IBM) newest PC, based on an Intel (INTC) processor.""Almost kind of like 10 years ago, when people asked, 'Who needs more than 640KB of RAM (computer memory, where 4GB is now standard)?' "" Cox said. ""Then it was, 'Who needs more than 100G in a metro?' I think it was hard for people to wrap their heads around it.""Since then, he says, bandwidth needs have multiplied. Cloud providers are leasing or buying data center spaces across the world as their needs outgrow those of traditional consumers like IT and Internet providers.Data center is the industry's new buzzword, and chipmakers especially are making a hard run for a piece of this market. Over the past year, Intel, Qualcomm (QCOM), Broadcom (AVGO), Nvidia (NVDA) and Integrated Device Technology (IDTI) have redoubled their data center efforts in a bid to gain share.""I think now when we talk about Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Facebook, everyone is building these infrastructures,"" Cox said. ""And the scale of these infrastructures is surprising everyone in the industry.""He added: ""There isn't so much disbelief any longer. I think we've proven we weren't kidding. In fact, I think we underestimated a little.""

596,QCOM,"Wedbush initiated coverage of Fitbit (FIT) with a top rating, Citigroup upgraded Apple (AAPL) chipmaker Qorvo (QRVO), RBC Capital upgraded LinkedIn (LNKD) and Wunderlich raised its price target on Proofpoint (PFPT).Wedbush started coverage with an outperform rating and a PT of 18, citing potentil to expand its installed base via programs like corporate wellness initiatives.Shares of Fitbit closed up 3.2% but have swooned more than 50% in 2016. The company has an IBD Composite Rating of 13 out of a possible 99.Citigroup upgraded Apple chip supplier Qorvo to neutral from sell while downgrading Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) to sell from neutral.“We believe Qorvo can sustain the dollar-content gain momentum in Samsung Galaxy S7 and iPhone SE gained this year,” said the Citigroup report.Qorvo shares edged up 0.1%, while Skyworks fell 0.6%.RBC Capital upgraded the business social network to outperform from neutral with a PT of 160. LinkedIn stock plunged on Feb. 5 after the Mountain View, Calif., company forecast full-year 2016 revenue below consensus estimates, owing to an advertising slowdown.But RBC's Mark Mahaney says a survey of human resource professionals shows LinkedIn is “reasonably well positioned against very large recruitment and advertising TAMs (total addressable markets).”LinkedIn shares climbed 2%.Wunderlich raised its PT on Proofpoint to 75 from 67. The security software firm hosted an analyst day Thursday in San Francisco, where it introduced 2020 financial targets, including reaching $1 billion in revenue.Proofpoint, which has an IBD Composite Rating of 43 out of a possible 99, fell 1.8%.Guggenheim Securities initiated coverage on medical product makers Boston Scientific (BSX) and Stryker (SYK) with buy ratings.Boston Scientific has an IBD Composite Rating of 97 out of a possible 99 and climbed 2.3% Thursday, while Strykers has a CR of 94 and added 0.9%.Guggenheim started coverage on Spectranetics (SPNC)  with a buy rating while Edward Lifesciences (EW) and Medtronic (MDT) both have neutral ratings.Raymond James, Longbow Research, Deutsche Bank and UBS downgraded Restoration Hardware (RH) to neutral.

597,QCOM,"Xilinx (XLNX) stock rocketed near the close Tuesday on a rumored $15 billion takeout offer, but Cowen analyst Timothy Arcuri says Apple (AAPL) supplier Qualcomm (QCOM) -- often cited as a potential Xilinx buyer -- would be better off targeting NXP Semiconductors (NXPI).Street Insider first reported the rumor of the offer, citing sources familiar with the matter, but didn't identify the bidder. Xilinx stock shot up 5.7% near the close Tuesday and was up a fraction in after-hours trading.Arcuri retained his outperform rating and 60 price target on Qualcomm stock. Earlier Tuesday, MKM analyst Ian Ing reiterated his view that Broadcom (AVGO) and Qualcomm are potential Xilinx suitors.But Arcuri says Xilinx wouldn't ""move the needle"" for Qualcomm, which may not be completely committed to the data center path. Xilinx's field programmable gate array (FPGA) chips are ideal for data center acceleration, Ing wrote in a research report.""In some ways, Xilinx would clearly accelerate Qualcomm's data center initiatives, but we wouldn't view a Qualcomm/Xilinx deal all that favorably for Qualcomm and would much rather see it buy an asset like NXP,"" Arcuri wrote in a research report. ""This would simply be a huge amount of money to spend for a deal that isn't transformational.""Acquiring NXP would allow Qualcomm to tap into offshore cash, which wouldn't be possible in the case of Xilinx, Arcuri noted. And as Xilinx suits up for a FPGA battle against Intel (INTC), it's planning on spending a lot of dough.""If we were Qualcomm, this factor argues it is better off to wait,"" he wrote.Still, Xilinx is the singular merchant FPGA player following Intel's $16.7 billion acquisition of rival Altera late last year, William Blair analyst Anil Doradla noted earlier Tuesday.The rumored takeout bid follows Xilinx's late Monday analyst day. But Doradla wasn't too impressed, saying the event ""lacked confidence."" Xilinx is focusing on cloud computing, embedded vision, industrial Internet of Things and 5G markets rather than its bread-and-butter wireless and wireline markets.

601,QCOM,"Apple (AAPL) supplier Qualcomm (QCOM) quintupled its content in the Samsung Galaxy S7 smartphone as radio frequency-chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO) repeatedly lost share to rival Qorvo (QRVO), a ChipWorks teardown shows.The ChipWorks teardown was last week, but it was highlighted in a research report Monday by Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill.InvenSense (INVN), another Apple supplier, apparently lost the GS7 gyroscope to STMicroelectronics (STM). InvenSense stock was down 1.5% in midday trading on the stock market today. STMicro stock was up a fraction.Three Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) chips were completely replaced in the GS7.Key winners in getting their chips inside the new phone, besides Qualcomm and Qorvo, included NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) and Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM).Although Broadcom retained a power amplifier, rival Qorvo swiped two Broadcom components from the GS7. But Broadcom replaced a Skyworks multiband module (a power amplifier).Last week, Broadcom CEO Hock Tan bragged that the chipmaker has increased its content by 20% every year for its ""North American customer,"" which analysts said is the Apple iPhone, and that another bump is expected with the release of the next iPhone, the iPhone 7, due out in September. Meanwhile, though, Broadcom is de-emphasizing its mobile unit, which will comprise 23% of Q2 sales, down from 32% in Q1, as smartphone shipments slow amid a saturated market.Samsung lowered its own chip content in the GS7 vs. the GS6. Qualcomm took four chips (including the application processor) from Samsung and replaced Cirrus Logic (CRUS)/Wolfson on an audio chip. SK Hynix, NXP and Maxim each replaced a Samsung component.But Samsung swapped STMicroelectronics' touch controller in the GS6 for its own controller in the GS7.And Texas Instruments (TXN) lost the wireless power receiver to Integrated Device Technology (IDTI).

602,QCOM,"Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) might score an Intel (INTC) license deal. It would scoop Tesla Motors (TSLA) partner Nvidia (NVDA), which receives $66 million in quarterly royalties from the No. 1 chipmaker, a Needham analyst says.But Argus analyst Jim Kelleher says that Nvidia has distanced itself from the PC market, instead focusing on niche growth areas like virtual reality (VR), autonomous vehicles, artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things and robotics.In VR, Facebook (FB)-owned Oculus recommends Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices graphics cards for its Rift series. This week, Oculus announced 30 new titles and demoed the tech at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco, Calif.Graphics cards are outfitted with GPUs, or graphics processing units. Advanced ones are needed for many of today's richly visual computing experiences that are computationally intensive -- everything from the movement in gameplay to VR and many other kinds of applications.On Friday, Kelleher initiated coverage on Nvidia stock with a buy rating and a 39 price target, a day after Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill reiterated a hold rating on Nvidia stock following the Intel-Advanced Micro Devices rumor. Nvidia is on the IBD 50 list of leading growth stocks.In early trading on the stock market today, Nvidia stock surged 3.9%, trading near 34.10 and in buy range from a 33.16 cup-with-handle buy point. Advanced Micro Devices stock flew higher, up 4.3%, but usually trades considerably lower, near 3.Nvidia's royalty deal with Intel is set to expire in 2017, and the GPU leader failed in December to defend its patents in a lawsuit against Samsung and Apple (AAPL) supplier Qualcomm (QCOM).""We don't litigate for our business model,"" CEO Jen-Hsun Huang told investors in November. ""We don't depend on licensing for our business model.""To offset the loss of Intel's royalty stream -- which will impact 2017 earnings per share by 25-30 cents -- Nvidia needs to add $470 million in annual revenue, Gill wrote in a research report. He noted that Intel can continue using Nvidia patents filed before March 31, 2017.""While Nvidia has expressed interest in monetizing its GPU patent assets, we have seen little evidence to date that this will materialize,"" he wrote.Nvidia controls 75%-80% of the GPU market, having long ago ceded the gaming console market to Advanced Micro Devices, which provides its RADEON semi-customized chips to Sony (SNE) and Microsoft (MSFT).In 2013, PC sales accounted for 42% of total Nvidia revenue. In 2016, gaming, enterprise graphics, data center and automotive brought in 85% of total revenue, dropping PC sales down to 9%. IP brought in 6%.Gaming represents a $20 billion market opportunity for Nvidia, leading $8 billion, $6.5 billion and $5 billion opportunities in the artificial intelligence, enterprise graphics and data center markets, respectively, Kelleher wrote.In fiscal 2016, gaming (largely PC) generated $2.8 billion of Nvidia's total $5.01 billion in sales, up 30% year over year. Nvidia targets 5%-10% annual growth ""based on gamers' insatiable desire for improved graphics in games,"" he wrote.Nvidia also pulled in $750 million in enterprise graphics, $340 million in data center and $320 million in automotive. In fiscal 2016, Nvidia's automotive segment grew 80% year over year and includes Nvidia-Tesla-partnered GPUs.The U.S. Department of Energy selected Nvidia's NVLink interconnected technology coupled with IBM (IBM) processors to power its next-generation supercomputers, 10 times faster than current supercomputers.Kelleher recognized that 2018 earnings might flatten as Nvidia makes further investments in ""growth niches.""""We regard this as an acceptable trade-off for building share in markets that could drive significant growth in years to come,"" he wrote.

603,QCOM,"Apple (AAPL) supplier stocks took a thumping Monday, ahead of expected lackluster reports from a number of the companies, as well as Apple, on slowing growth for iPhone sales.Qualcomm (QCOM) stock was down just a fraction, but shares of Cirrus Logic (CRUS) and InvenSense (INVN) were down 2.5% and 4.5%, respectively, in early afternoon trading on the stock market today. All three are slated to post December-quarter results after the close Wednesday.Shares of Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), meanwhile, were each down more than 1.5% Monday afternoon. Skyworks is slated to report earnings late Thursday, and NXP on Feb. 4.Apple was down a fraction Monday afternoon. It reports after the close Tuesday, with Wall Street eyeing Apple's China sales. China accounted for a quarter of iPhone sales in 2015, according to one report. That nation's slowing economic growth has put a damper on stock markets worldwide, and on many tech stocks specifically.The December quarter is Apple's first full quarter of iPhone 6S series sales. Suppliers Cirrus Logic, Qorvo and Dialog Semiconductor recently slashed their December views on apparently slowing iPhone demand.For its fiscal Q3, Cirrus Logic said earlier this month it expects $347 million in sales, down from its earlier guidance for $370 million to $400 million.The consensus of eight analysts polled by Thomson Reuters projects a 16% year-over-year dip in EPS ex items to 81 cents. They see sales rising 16% to $346.9 million, but that would be the smallest rise in five quarters. Cirrus Logic's EPS fell 4% year over year in the previous quarter. Sales have grown by double digits since September 2014.Qualcomm's fiscal Q1 sales are expected to fall 20% to $5.69 billion. The consensus of 36 analysts also sees 90 cents EPS ex items, down 33%, which would be the third straight quarter of an earnings decline.In November, Qualcomm guided to $5.2 billion to $6 billion in sales and 80-90 cents EPS ex items. Sales are expected to decelerate for the third consecutive quarter.InvenSense is expected to report its smallest sales gain in at least four years. For its fiscal Q3, Wall Street sees InvenSense reporting $117.7 million in sales and 18 cents EPS minus items, up 2% and down 14%, respectively.Sales have grown by double digits in 17 of InvenSense's past 18 quarters.Connect with Allison Gatlin on Facebook.

605,QCOM,"Broadly, Xilinx's (XLNX) analyst day Monday was an acknowledgement that the field programmable gate array (FPGA) industry will grow less than 10% in the long term, which could hurt the $16.7 billion bet placed last year by No. 1 chipmaker Intel (INTC) on FPGA-maker Altera, a William Blair analyst said Tuesday.Late Monday, stand-alone FPGA maker Xilinx reiterated its fiscal 2017 guidance for growth of 4%-8% for sales and 7%-9% for operational expenses. Through 2021, Xilinx expects $750 million in incremental opportunity, but that only represents a 6% compound annual growth rate. FPGAs are chips which customers can program ""in the field,"" after manufacture, according to their needs.The overall tone Monday was positive ""but lacked conviction,"" William Blair analyst Anil Doradla wrote Tuesday in a research report. Commentary regarding Xilinx's bread-and-butter wireless and wireline segments was limited, leading Doradla to say demand ""continues to be muted.""""We believe the company is working hard to diversify away from its traditional markets as the company's core markets continue to face structural shifts and increasingly pose headwinds to the company,"" he wrote.Asian product makers are unlikely to pay premium dollars for Xilinx's high-end FPGAs, and the company's aerospace and defense spending opportunities are highly exposed to volatile government funding, Doradla wrote. But he kept his outperform rating on Xilinx stock.Xilinx's commentary Monday centered on growth opportunities within cloud computing, embedded vision, industrial Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G markets. There, Xilinx faces FPGA competition from Intel/Altera and an IoT rivalry with Nvidia (NVDA) graphics chips.On the stock market today, Xilinx stock surged 5.7%, to 47.45. Shares have climbed incrementally on seven of the past eight trading days. But Tuesday's rise underperformed IBD's 41-company Electronic Semiconductor-Fabless industry group, which ended the day up more than 3% Tuesday. Intel stock was up 2.8%, to 31.06.Xilinx's fiscal 2017 investments could lead to greater market share gains against Intel/Altera, Rosenblatt analyst Kinngai Chan wrote in a report. Xilinx sees its 28-nanometer and 20-nm market share at 65% and 80%, respectively. And Xilinx forecasts a one-year lead on Altera in the 16-nm market. This refers to the width of the circuitry etching in chips, so the smaller the manufacturing capability, the more electronics that in theory can go onto a chip.The investments should lead to ""robust"" growth for patient investors in 2021, MKM analyst Ian Ing says. The competitive landscape vs. Intel looks ""benign,"" and Xilinx's uniquely re-configurable chips are ideal for data center acceleration, he wrote in a report.But ""we do not foresee Xilinx's investment time frames shortening from the four-five years from initial investments to material revenues,"" he wrote. ""Specialty FPGA chips are unique, given that they must go through two complete design and development cycles before volume.""That could drive off potential investors, he wrote, reiterating his belief that Xilinx could benefit from an acquisition by Apple (AAPL) suppliers such as Qualcomm (QCOM) or Broadcom (AVGO). William Blair's Doradla noted as much -- Xilinx remains the singular merchant player in the FPGA market, he said.Ing kept his neutral rating and 45 price target on Xilinx stock.

607,QCOM,"Tesla Motors (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk's pledge to make 1 million electric cars by 2020 could be a boon for chipmakers clobbered by the first decline in sales of Apple's (AAPL) iPhone, a major hit product that fueled growth for many Apple suppliers since 2007.Now, hunger for the next growth vector has many chipmakers eyeing the automotive and Internet of Things markets, even as smartphones will remain a key profit center for some semiconductor companies.""I view the IoT market as a massive opportunity, and the autonomous vehicle is a part of that,"" Edward Jones analyst Bill Kreher told IBD. ""Over time, this market will experience widespread adoption. Simply, the promise of greater productivity will drive demand over the long run.""The deck is always reshuffled every few years and always to the most innovative technology. We think the IoT is the next battleground.""Kreher expects the IoT industry overall, including automotive, to grow 10% to 15% annually in the next three years.Sensor makers like Analog Devices (ADI), NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) and Texas Instruments (TXN); analog chipmakers like MaxLinear (MXL) and Maxim Integrated Devices (MXIM); and graphics-chip companies like Nvidia (NVDA) are among those seen as especially primed in these fields.But not everyone is as hot on the Internet of Things. Robert Maire, president of tech research and consulting firm Semiconductor Advisers, calls today's cars ""PCs on wheels"" and ""smartphones on steroids,"" but he says other IoT fields typically use cheaper chips than the higher-end chips powering smartphones.Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) CEO David Aldrich said in April that the IoT opportunity is ""measured in the tens of billions of units,"" but Maire says that doesn't mean huge revenue growth.""It won't be the Internet of Things (replacing smartphones), because Internet of Things is based on typically trailing-edge semiconductor technology,"" Maire told IBD. ""About $5 worth of semiconductors go into an Internet-connected thermostat that sells for $75-$100.""The Qualcomm (QCOM) chip content alone in Apple's iPhone 6 has been estimated at $20 to $22 per unit by teardown specialist iFixit.But companies such as Qualcomm and Integrated Device Technology (IDTI) are looking beyond the smartphone era to a future dominated by smarter cities, smarter devices and smarter cars -- and are eagerly watching efforts by tech heavyweights Tesla, Apple and Google (GOOGL) to make it happen.Still, estimating the size of the IoT chip market is like a game of pin the tail on the donkey. The numbers are high but cover a lot of ground.Last year, research firm McKinsey pegged revenue for the total IoT market at $3.9 trillion to $11.1 trillion a year by 2025. At the highest end, that means IoT could account for more than 10% of the total world economy.In April, Business Insider estimated there will be 24 billion IoT-connected devices by 2020. More than $6 trillion will be invested in IoT solutions over the next five years, the online news site's Business Intelligence research unit estimates.Many of Apple's chip suppliers want a bite of IoT, but not all. Broadcom (AVGO) in April sold its Internet of Things unit to Cypress Semiconductor (CY) for $550 million. The unit generated just $189 million in revenue in the past 12 months, 3% of Broadcom's total sales.Broadcom declined to comment on the IoT unit's sale or on slowing smartphone sales. In its fiscal Q1 ended Jan. 31, Broadcom reported that its wireless business (which includes smartphone sales) pulled in $578 million in sales, about a third of total revenue. MKM analyst Ian Ing estimates 10% of Broadcom's mobile sales stem from smartphone-saturated China.Qorvo (QRVO) and Skyworks, Broadcom's rival makers of the radio-frequency chips that go inside smartphones, are buying into the IoT market -- Qorvo doing so literally with its April acquisition of IoT supplier GreenPeak. GreenPeak makes ultra-low-power, short-range wireless chips for smart homes.The acquisition should help Qorvo diversify. Qorvo didn't return requests for comment about slowing smartphone sales. For its fiscal Q4 ended April 2, Qorvo's mobile product sales accounted for $465 million, or about 76%, of total revenue.As for Skyworks, its integrated mobile systems and power amplifiers segments accounted for 73% of its total sales last quarter. Apple's iPhone 6S uses two Skyworks power amplifier modules, teardowns show.But Skyworks' broad markets division, which includes IoT-related sales, grew 18% vs. the year-earlier quarter and made up 25% of sales, Aldrich said on the company's earnings conference call in April. He estimated the IoT opportunity growing at an 83% compound annual growth rate through 2020.Apple Watch and Samsung Galaxy supplier Integrated Device Technology acknowledges the smartphone slowdown but says its future is in wireless charging. IDT's chips are used inside portable devices to enable wireless charging, which will become ever more important as Apple reportedly prepares to eliminate wired charging entirely from the iPhone 8 in 2017.IDT is about 17% exposed to the mobile market, CTO Sailesh Chittipeddi told IBD.Smartphones have reached a saturation point. But not every piece of accompanying technology has peaked, Chittipeddi said. RF suppliers Broadcom, Qorvo and Skyworks also say that while unit shipments might stagnate, dollar content will grow. In January, Broadcom CEO Hock Tan said RF content has grown 20%-plus every year regardless the number of units shipped.Qualcomm -- doubly exposed through its chip sales and licensing business -- is also bullish on continued growth of its smartphone business. The breadth of technology on a smartphone will only continue to grow, CEO Steven Mollenkopf told analysts during the company's February analyst day.""The smartphone ecosystem is going to continue to grow, as wireless charging penetration of that market continues to increase,"" Chittipeddi told IBD. ""People still sell over 1.2 billion smartphones per year and not every one of them today has wireless charging.""And there are other demands for wireless charging. In March, IDT hosted a Hackster challenge, instructing participants to come up with new uses for wireless charging. Er Bharath Ram came up with an on-the-go coffee maker, beating out oddities like a tiny remote-controlled tank, a ""magic toothbrush"" and shoes for Alzheimer's sufferers.""Furniture, automotive applications, headsets, warmers, drones ... will provide growth,"" Chittipeddi said, though he concedes not as much growth as a new, high-volume smartphone.Last year, IDT expanded into sensors with the $310 million acquisition of ZMDI, Chittipeddi said. IDT plans to leverage that sensor business within the burgeoning automotive and infotainment market competing against NXP Semiconductors.About the same time IDT wrapped its ZMDI acquisition, NXP finished up its nearly $13 billion purchase of Freescale Semiconductors. NXP now boasts a $28.5 billion market cap to IDT's $2.7 billion. NXP CEO Rick Clemmer estimates 40% of his company's sales stem from the automotive segment.Clemmer says NXP spotted the smartphone's deceleration well ahead of time. Although, like Chittipeddi, he still sees growth for specialized smartphone tech. NXP chips are used to encrypt mobile payments for systems like Apple Pay, Samsung Wallet or Google Wallet.""Maybe 15% to 20% of smartphones have mobile wallets (and) we think that can go up to 60%,"" he said. ""We see a tripling of our volume because of the increased share that has the mobile wallet technology.""Buying Freescale helped de-emphasize mobile. In Q1, NXP's $471 million in secure connected devices (mobile) accounted for 21% of sales. But Clemmer says that exposure, on average, is about 15%. It also allowed the combined company to become the top automotive chip player, he says.NXP is also working with Tesla, Google, Apple and  Ford (F) as they work to develop self-driving cars, Clemmer says, another key push for NXP.That automotive opportunity will be huge, says Nvidia's director of automotive, Danny Shapiro. In April, Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang unveiled a trio of autonomous cars code-named BB8, C3PO and R2D2 -- a riff on the popular ""Star Wars"" franchise.Like NXP, Nvidia has developed an autonomous-driving platform for carmakers. Unlike NXP, Nvidia only briefly dabbled in smartphones for which graphics only need to be ""good enough,"" Shapiro told IBD. Nvidia, he says, is angling for the bleeding edge of tech.So, no smartphone chips from Nvidia. ""There's no value there for us,"" Shapiro said. But ""I believe the car will be the most powerful computer you will ever own. ... We've moved beyond the graphics in your vehicles to being able to process the data. And for that, you need a supercomputer.""

608,QCOM,"Apple (AAPL) iPhone chip supplier NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) could double its chip content per vehicle by 2025, as Tesla Motors (TSLA), Google (GOOGL), Apple and Ford (F) make a play for the nascent self-driving car market, Canaccord analyst Matthew Ramsay said Thursday.Premium cars like BMW’s 7 series already contain north of $1,000 in semiconductor content, including $300 in NXP chips, Ramsay wrote in a research report Thursday. Other cars contain much less chip content. Autonomous cars, though, eventually could drive chip content per vehicle to greater than $2,500, observers say.“We believe the emergence of autonomous driving and ADAS (advanced driver assistance systems) will push overall semiconductor content per vehicle higher by 50% to greater than $500 by 2025,” he wrote.But even lower-tier vehicles will get a chip push, Ramsay notes. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is requiring that by 2018 all new cars include backup cameras, and 20 top carmakers recently pledged to include emergency braking in all new vehicles by 2022.NXP is well-positioned to capture some of the chip-content gains, he says. Over the next three years, NXP sees 5%-7% top-line growth driven by 10% growth in its automotive segment, though it expects only 3%-4% growth in vehicles sold worldwide.Ramsay says NXP can exceed its own targets. NXP estimates it has 11% market share in its core automotive segments -- infotainment, security, powertrain and safety -- and 14% overall automotive market share.General Motors (GM) CEO Mary Barra has said “the auto industry will change more in the next five to 10 years than it has in the last 50.”Barra's quote permeated NXP's FTF Conference last week in Austin, Texas, Ramsay wrote. About 90% of automotive innovation is driven by electric hardware and software, NXP says. Infotainment, safety, efficiency, security, consolidation and regulation will drive that innovation.NXP expects infotainment content per vehicle to climb to $18-$45 in 2018 from $10 in 2006. And despite strong competition from Nvidia (NVDA), Qualcomm (QCOM) and STMicroelectronics (STM), Ramsay argues, ""NXP currently has the most complete infotainment system across the breadth of components.""In the stock market today, NXP stock lost 0.7% to 91.33. But shares are up 8% this year, outperforming IBD's 41-company Electronic Semiconductor-Fabless industry group, which has risen 2% over the same period.NXP is Ramsay's top pick for chip stocks. He reiterated a buy rating and 120 price target on NXP stock.

610,QCOM,"Here’s a quick rundown of Wednesday’s after-hours action:Facebook (FB) stock jumped 12% after the social networking giant handily topped quarterly earnings and revenue expectations. Adjusted EPS grew 46 percent to 79 cents while revenue jumped 51% to $5.84 billion. Daily active users increased 17% to 1.04 billion.EBay (EBAY) fell 12% after issuing weak guidance for the current quarter. For the fourth quarter, EBay delivered flat revenue and an EPS decline of 44%. Both were in line with analyst estimates.Former counterpart PayPal (PYPL) rose 5% in extended trading after the electronic payments firm reported better-than-expected earnings. PayPal credited strong payment volume as well as customer and account growth.Three Apple (AAPL) chip suppliers also reported earnings, a day after Apple reported flat iPhone sales and a grim revenue forecasts, sending its shares down 6.6% at the close.Qualcomm (QCOM) fell slightly despite smashing first-quarter sales and earnings forecasts. Qualcomm’s second-quarter top- and bottom-line guidance was weak.Cirrus Logic (CRUS) also beat quarterly forecasts but its current-quarter guidance was light. Cirrus Logic stock rose 2% late.And Cavium (CAVM) reported earnings that were in line with views, but revenue that missed expectations. Cavium stock jumped 11% after hours.

611,QCOM,"Tech stock declines piled on Monday, snowballing after badly received quarterly reports last week from the likes of LinkedIn (LNKD) and Tableau (DATA), whose stocks sheared off. Apple (AAPL) supplier NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), GoPro (GPRO) supplier Ambarella (AMBA) and cybersecurity bigwig Palo Alto Networks (PANW) all were down Monday following a brutal last week, among other decliners.IBD's 26-company Computer Software-Security industry group was collectively down 6.9% in afternoon trading. The 41-company Electronics-Semiconductor Fabless industry group was down 2.7%.Ahead of the closing bell on the stock market today, Palo Alto stock was down 9%. Shares of CyberArk Software (CYBR), FireEye (FEYE) and Proofpoint (PFPT) were down about 9%, 9.5% and 10%, respectively.Shares of NXP and Ambarella were down 9.5% and 6.4%, respectively.  Apple suppliers Avago Technologies (AVGO) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) both fell more than 5% while Cirrus Logic (CRUS) and Qorvo (QRVO) were each down about 2%.Only a handful of stocks escaped the high-tech sell-off -- a continuation of a Friday deluge that saw LinkedIn stock lose nearly half its value on Wall Street after the professional networker announced a low 2016 forecast.Compounding the pressure, analysts see Big Data analytics software maker Tableau losing market share to Amazon.com (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT). Tableau, too, guided to current-quarter sales and earnings that missed the consensus expectation.Security vendors lost 7.4% and fabless chip makers closed down 4% on Friday.NXP's plunge looks incongruous after the Apple chip supplier's Q4 beat last week, but comes on a day when techs are broadly down, and amid an acquisition. In the long run, picking up Freescale is making NXP an automotive powerhouse -- sales in that segment bounded 45% year over year to $422 million.The Freescale deal also halves NXP's Apple iPhone exposure as the smartphone giant deals with floundering demand. Apple chip suppliers Cirrus Logic, Qorvo, Qualcomm (QCOM) and InvenSense (INVN) recently issued March-quarter views that lagged the consensus.At least six analysts this month have rated NXP stock a buy, including two on Monday. A Jefferies analyst boosted his price target on NXP stock to 112 from 107.Ambarella stock sank as GoPro stock rocketed 10% as of Monday afternoon on its partnership with Microsoft. GoPro and Microsoft will partner on a patent-licensing agreement for file storage and other system technologies.""This agreement with GoPro shows the incredible breadth of technology sharing enabled through patent transactions,"" Microsoft's technology licensing president, Nick Psyhogeos, said in a press release.Last week, GoPro stock wiped out after missing Wall Street's Q4 earnings views and guiding well below consensus Q1 expectations. Shares closed down nearly 9% on Feb. 4. But chip maker Ambarella missed the scrum and pulled ahead 5.1% that day.At least seven analysts cut their price targets on GoPro stock following the Q4 report. But at least three reiterated a buy rating, and another boosted his price target.Ambarella tried distancing itself from GoPro during its December quarter, instead highlighting the company's expansion into drones and home security.

In afternoon trading, shares were up 10%.Analysts pegged Xilinx as a takeover candidate amid chip M&A furor that hit a fever pitch in 2015. Deals last year topped a record $100 billion as the industry slows, competition mounts and macro uncertainties surrounding China continue.Xilinx Tops Q3 Sales ViewsIn conjunction with the SEC filing, Xilinx reported fiscal Q3 sales that topped the consensus model of 24 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. For its Q3 2016 ended Jan. 2, Xilinx reported $566 million in sales vs. analyst views for $554.5 million. Three months ago, Xilinx guided to between $543 million and $565 million in sales.But Q3 sales fell 5% vs. the year-earlier quarter, and earnings per share ex items of 49 cents were merely in line with analyst expectations. EPS fell 21% year over year.For the current quarter, Xilinx guided to flat sequential sales. That would be in line with the company's year-ago results and meet Wall Street forecasts for $565.9 million, William Blair analyst Anil Doradla wrote in a research report.During Q3, Xilinx's communications unit grew 12% sequentially to $243 million vs. consensus expectations for $231 million, MKM analyst Ian Ing wrote in a report. The industrial unit, too, grew 7% quarter over quarter to $323 million, topping analyst views for $228 million.But the company's auto unit fell 4% sequentially on ""the timing of automotive program purchases,"" Ing wrote.Long term, growth within the field-programmable gate array (FPGA) industry is somewhat strangled, Ing and Doradla wrote. Altera, a former programmable-chip rival, was just swallowed into Intel (INTC) for $16.7 billion.M&A 'Smoke' Billowing XilinxFor Xilinx, FPGAs have grown at mid-single-digits vs. earlier ambitions of double digit growth, Ing wrote. That, combined with Xilinx's lack of a March analyst day, has created some ""smoke"" screening potential M&A activity, he wrote.""We continue to think fabless companies are ripe for consolidation as scale matters more than specialization,"" he wrote. ""Qualcomm for Xilinx to bolster its mobile infrastructure offerings makes strategic sense to us.""Ing maintained his neutral rating and 46 price target on Xilinx stock. Doradla rates Xilinx stock a market perform.Credit Suisse analyst John Pitzer sees Xilinx as ""absolutely attractive/accretive to suitors, albeit the ability to pay an Altera-like premium is unlikely.""""Intel was uniquely positioned with their data center group footprint to lever a programmable logic device asset and/or defend its considerable profit pool,"" he wrote.Intel scooped up Altera for $54 per share in a plan announced June 1. That amount was an 11% premium to the prior Friday's closing price, but 56% above where Altera was before rumors of a potential deal first arose March 27, according to Bloomberg. The deal closed in December.Over the last 12 months, the average premium on M&A targets has been 25%, Pitzer wrote. For Xilinx stock, which closed at 43.08 on Wednesday, that implies a purchase price of $54 per share, Pitzer wrote.""Applying an Altera-like price-earnings multiple would drive an upside target of $90,"" he wrote. But that's extremely unlikely, he added.Pitzer reiterated his neutral rating on Xilinx stock but raised his price target to 45 from 38.Connect with Allison Gatlin on Twitter @IBD_AGatlin and on Facebook.

615,QCOM,"Qualcomm's (QCOM) union with Japanese TDK is ""much ado about nothing,"" a Craig-Hallum analyst wrote Thursday as he reiterated a buy rating on fellow Apple (AAPL) supplier Skyworks Solutions (SWKS).The Qualcomm-TDK joint venture, announced Wednesday and expected to be completed in 2017, won't pose much threat to radio-frequency chip leaders Skyworks and Qorvo (QRVO), nor touch Avago Technologies' (AVGO) filter offerings, Craig-Hallum analyst Anthony Stoss wrote in a research report Thursday.""Despite Qualcomm's efforts, Qualcomm 360 products have been unable to match the performance, customization and integration required by handset makers,"" Stoss wrote. The products have ""gained very small traction to date.""But Qualcomm and Skyworks stocks each suffered price-target cuts Thursday on ""growing concerns over weak iPhone 6S sales,"" Stoss wrote.Apple Supplier Cuts GuidanceIn the stock market today, Skyworks closed up 3.8% at 64.54, but Qorvo stock fell 2.4% to 39.42. Qualcomm stock closed up 3.5% at 47.73.Stoss cut his price target on Skyworks stock to 100 from 125 after shares fell to a 14-month low Wednesday on Apple supplier Multi-Fineline Electronix's (MFLX) soft Q4 sales guidance.Multi-Fineline stock crashed 22% on Wednesday, hitting an 11-month low, after the company guided to $169 million in Q4 sales vs. its previous views for $170 million to $200 million. The company blamed soft smartphone sales for the floundering view. Shares rebounded 15.6% Thursday.Poor Apple iPhone sales will undoubtedly smudge Skyworks' top line, says Stoss, but he sees the company benefiting from a 15%-20% boost in RF content per unit over the next year and two-year visibility on all flagship phones.""Moreover, we believe the new features rumored to come in the iPhone 7 this fall could re-accelerate iPhone unit growth quickly, turning Apple headwinds into Apple tailwinds,"" he wrote.Meanwhile, Samsung is preparing to ramp its Galaxy S7, which should benefit Qualcomm, Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh wrote in a report Thursday. Rakesh maintained his neutral rating but dropped his price target on Qualcomm stock to 51 from 64.Qualcomm Licensing Makes U-TurnQualcomm's licensing business is also making a U-turn in China where Xiaomi, Haier, Huizhou TCL Mobile and Tianyu have signed new royalty agreements, Argus analyst Jim Kelleher wrote in a report.Re-signing outdated contracts has been an uphill battle in the wake of a settlement with Chinese authorities over an antimonopoly dispute. In September, Qualcomm reported an 18% year-over-year sales dip as a result of companies' reluctance to enter new government-approved contracts.The new contracts ""should enable Qualcomm to receive currently due and retroactive royalty and licensing payments,"" Kelleher wrote.Still, Qualcomm stock has pulled back 5% since New Year's Day after falling 33% in 2015, lagging the 8% gain of its 43-company IBD Electronic-Semiconductor Fabless industry group.But Kelleher is more positive on Qualcomm stock than is Craig-Hallum's Stoss. The market tends to overlook Qualcomm's positives and on Wednesday largely shrugged at the TDK alliance, Kelleher wrote.""In December, we wrote that, given all the M&A in semiconductors, we would not be surprised to see Qualcomm make a major acquisition,"" he wrote. ""Formation of the RF360 Holdings JV spares Qualcomm the expense of a major asset buy while positioning the company to meaningfully increase its content per device.""Kelleher maintained his buy rating on Qualcomm stock but cut his price target to 70 from 80.Connect with Allison Gatlin on Twitter @IBD_AGatlin and on Facebook.

627,QCOM,"Avago Technologies has been one of the hottest stocks in tech this year, thanks in no small part to the chipmaker's ties with the world's top-valued company, Apple.Now Avago's (AVGO) ties to Apple (AAPL) will strengthen when the former takes over chip company Broadcom (BRCM). In a deal valued at $37 billion, the new entity will take the Broadcom name, and Avago Chief Executive Hock Tan will head the combined firm.The two complement each other as Apple contractors, supplying chips to different parts of Apple's iPhone and other smartphones — Avago makes radio frequency chips and filters, and Broadcom produces controller and Wi-Fi combination chips. Set-top boxes and cars also use Broadcom chips.Avago expects the Broadcom deal to close early in the first calendar quarter of 2016. Avago has already been working on integration plans to get a head start on day one.""Avago has done a great job in integrating companies and cutting costs out of operations,"" analyst Thomas Diffely of D.A. Davidson told Investor's Business Daily.Diffely said in the shorter term, Avago will benefit from hundreds of millions of dollars in cost savings from the Broadcom merger as it integrates the two operations.""Over time, Avago will have a more integrated chip solution for the mobile consumer in particular,"" Diffely said.HP OriginsAvago got its start in the 1960s as the semiconductor arm of Hewlett-Packard, now HP Inc. (HPQ). It later became part of Agilent Technologies (A) before private equity investors bought the business in 2005 and took it public in 2009.Shares have climbed steadily since that IPO, which was priced at 15. Avago's shares now stand at roughly 149, after surging 90% in 2014 and another 47% this year.Revenue also has been on a strong uphill run, more than quadrupling from $1.5 billion in 2009 to $6.9 billion in 2015. The 2015 number is up 60% from 2014.In addition to being used in Apple's new iPhone 6s and other smartphones, Avago's chips are found in data networking, telecom equipment and industrial uses. The firm's two biggest business segments, in wireless and networking, have grown through a string of acquisitions in recent years.Five Firms In Two YearsIn the last two years alone, Avago acquired five companies, including data-center chipmaker LSI for $6.6 billion; PLX Technology, which makes integrated circuits; and most recently, the networking company Emulex.As Broadcom merges with Avago, revenue in 2016 likely will grow another 8% to $7.39 billion, according to analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. But Avago still will trail No. 1 chipmaker Intel (INTC) and fellow chip company and Apple supplier Qualcomm (QCOM).Avago singled out one customer for contributing more than 20% of revenue in the fourth quarter: Foxconn, the Chinese electronics contract manufacturer that rolls out iPhones for Apple.Slowdown SeenBut Avago's first quarter, which ends in January, is expected to see a seasonal slowdown in iPhones, a drop-off made more noticeable in the aftermath of the iPhone 6s launch and ramp-up. Avago expects wireless sales in the current first quarter to decline in the low-teens-percent range from the fourth quarter.Still, analysts don't seem worried for Avago's future.""Even if units are flat, Apple is still increasing content,"" Diffely said.Other handset makers trying to close the gap with Apple, such as Samsung and China's Huawei, will need advanced technology, he adds.""Bottom line, the need for advanced chips for these phones continues to rise,"" Diffely said.Morgan Stanley analyst Craig Hettenbach expects a sharp acceleration in Avago's wireless business during the second half of 2016, aided by new capacity to handle new wafer sizes and higher dollar value content in premium filters due to rising LTE penetration and new wireless bands. (LTE is a high-speed wireless standard.)""Now that the quarter is out of the way and, importantly, numbers are intact, we see Avago handily outperforming into 2016,"" Hettenbach said in a note to clients following the fourth-quarter report.Enterprise Storage BoomMeanwhile, Avago's enterprise storage business has been performing ""rather amazingly,"" Avago CEO Tan said in the fourth-quarter conference call in early December. Revenue in that October-ending quarter was up 9% from the third quarter, despite soft demand.Enterprise storage accounted for 35% of total revenue in the quarter. That was nearly as much generated by the firm's biggest division, wireless communications, which made up 37% of the total and was up 10% from the previous quarter.Avago expects its enterprise storage business to maintain its momentum in the first quarter, with revenue still growing slightly from the fourth quarter, Tan said on the call.""We also believe we may be gaining share in this segment,"" he added.Hettenbach noted that product enhancements via acquisitions of LSI, PLX Technology and Emulex likely helped Avago's enterprise storage business.The company's much smaller wired infrastructure business showed 2% revenue growth from the third quarter and 7% year-over-year. The even smaller industrial segment saw a 10% decline from the third quarter and a 7% drop from the year-earlier period, with the Americas and Japan the weakest regions.Total revenue in the quarter rose 15% over the earlier year to $1.85 billion, while earnings climbed 26% to $2.51 a share. Gross margin moved up to 62% from 58%.Analysts estimate that 2016 earnings will rise 8% to $9.71 a share, according to a poll by Thomson Reuters.

629,QCOM,"Avago Technologies (AVGO) stock steamrolled the IBD Electronics-Semiconductor Fabless industry group in 2015, rocketing 45% since January on its chipmaking link to the golden smartphone goose. But other Apple (AAPL) suppliers weren't as lucky.Qualcomm (QCOM) and Qorvo (QRVO) stocks have plunged 32% and 22%, respectively, since January. Both trail their IBD performance groups in spades and face ongoing Asian headwinds that include a challenge from China's Tsinghua Unigroup to unseat Qualcomm from its No. 3 chip slot.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM), too, underperformed its IBD Electronics-Semiconductor Manufacturing industry group, by rising 2% in 2015 vs. the group's collective 3% rise.And every supplier, according to analysts, will likely feel hunger pangs as Apple appears likely to cut its orders in the typically tough March quarter while facing an iPhone sales drought.Intraday on the stock market today, nearly every Apple chip supplier dipped and Cirrus Logic (CRUS) stock led the way as shares fell about 3% ahead of the new year. Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) stock followed and was down 1.5% midday Thursday.Broadcom (BRCM) and Taiwan Semiconductor stocks, alone, managed to stay in the green and were up fractionally in midday trading.Avago's Blowout 2015Without a doubt, Avago had a blowout 2015 and consistently topped quarterly Wall Street views. The chipmaker ended its fiscal year 2015 (in November) with $8.98 earnings per share ex items on $6.9 billion in sales, up 83% and 60% vs. 2014.In December, eight analysts rated Avago stock a buy.But the company's growth is slowing. During the first half of 2015, Avago posted triple-digit earnings and sales growth. In Q3 and Q4, those numbers braked to double-digit growth. Now the consensus of 26 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters largely expects single-digit growth in 2016.The $37 billion plan to acquire Broadcom could buoy those figures. Avago announced its plan to acquire Apple rival Broadcom in May, shortly after it promised to buy data connector Emulex for $606 million in February. The deal is expected to close in Q1.Avago's Broadcom deal was one of more than $100 billion in chip sector deals in 2015. Analysts say semiconductor M&A activity will continue in 2016 as, such is Avago's plight, growth slows, competition mounts and the economy lags.Qualcomm Snagged In ChinaChinese licensing negotiations pummeled Qualcomm in 2015 and led to an internal review spurred by activist investor JANA Partners that would have seen the chipmaker split.But Qualcomm recently decided against jettisoning its licensing business. CEO Steve Mollenkopf told investors earlier this month, ""The strategic benefits of our model are not replicable through alternative structures.""That model has caused particular ire in China. Qualcomm settled an anti-monopoly suit with China's National Development and Reform Commission in February but has since struggled to collect royalties from Chinese smartphone makers.""We believe in connection with the negotiations, (some licensees) have stopped reporting certain of their sales and royalties or did not report their sales and royalties in a manner that allows us to record revenue,"" Qualcomm President Derek Aberle told investors in November.Authorities in Taiwan have since launched an antitrust investigation into Qualcomm's licensing business, following in the footsteps of similar probes in China and South Korea. The European Commission also recently alleged that Qualcomm paid a major customer to use its chips exclusively and engaged in ""predatory pricing"" to force competitors out of the market.For its fiscal Q4, Qualcomm reported an 18% dip in sales to $5.5 billion and 91 cents EPS minus items, down 28% vs. the year-earlier quarter. Both measures, however, beat the consensus model.Qualcomm ended fiscal 2015 with $25.3 billion in sales and $4.66 EPS minus items, down 5% and 12%, respectively, vs. fiscal 2014. The consensus of 36 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters currently sees Qualcomm's fiscal 2016 sales and EPS ex items dropping 8% and 11%, respectively.Connect with Allison Gatlin on Twitter @IBD_AGatlin and on Facebook.

The New York-based firm jumped in after-hours trade Tuesday following the company's announcement that it planned to spin off its retail insurance business, totaling about $240 billion in assets and about 20% of the overall company's operating earnings.The timing of the spin-off will depend on a Securities and Exchange Commission review, the company said. MetLife shares have been in a deepening consolidation since July.Israel-based security software developer CyberArk Software (CYBR) flashed 11% higher after news reports said Check Point Software (CHKP), also an Israeli company, was considering a buyout bid. Details were scant and the companies declined to comment, according to Reuters. CyberArk has been struggling in a worsening correction since June.Among leaders, Avago Technologies (AVGO) traded down more than 3% in premarket action. The stock recovered losses Tuesday to end with 1% gain and back above its 200-day moving average, despite analysts continuing to backtrack on initial forecasts for 2016 shipments of Apple's (AAPL) iPhones. Avago supplies components used in the devices.On Wednesday, Qualcomm and TDK announced a joint venture for RF front-end modules for mobile devices, sending shares of Apple suppliers lower.Avago is fighting to hold support at its 200-day line, deep below a 149.82 buy point in a cup-with-handle base.

631,QCOM,"Just as the stock market goes through a correction, earnings for the tech companies in the S&P 500 are expected to record their first year-over-year decline in the past 10 quarters.A slowing China, weak global economy, strong dollar, poor PC sales and the shift to cloud computing continue to weigh on the tech sector, and the top tech companies' Q4 EPS are seen falling for the first time since Q2 2013.""Tech remains stuck in a low-growth environment, and the interaction of rising interest rates, a strong dollar, weak oil and commodities are increasing risk,"" said Bill Whyman, head of technology strategy research at Evercore ISI.Tech spending growth generally is slow, says Whyman, but he adds that underneath the surface, there is an aggressive shift in spending that favors companies connected to cloud computing, including providers of software-as-a-service (SaaS) platforms and young, disruptive Internet companies.Apple, Facebook, Amazon Earnings On TapThus far, 13 of the 68 tech companies in the S&P 500 have reported earnings, including Intel (INTC) and IBM (IBM), which both provided tepid guidance that sent their shares falling.The tech earnings season gets into full swing starting Tuesday, with the biggest company of them all — Apple (AAPL) — set to report that day after the market close amid fast falling expectations for sales of its top product, the iPhone. On Wednesday comes Facebook (FB) and Qualcomm (QCOM), both after the close. On Thursday it's Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT), also after the close. Google-owner Alphabet (GOOGL) reports on Monday, Feb. 1, after the close.The consensus estimate for the 68 tech companies in the S&P 500 is for earnings per share minus items to fall 3.4% from the year-earlier quarter, the fourth quarter in a row of deceleration. Subtracting Apple, which has the largest impact of any company in S&P 500, tech earnings would fall 6.7%, according to estimates collected by Thomson Reuters.For the S&P 500 as a whole, analysts call for EPS ex items, such as stock options and one-time expenses, to fall 4.5%. That drop is largely due to the ailing energy sector, which is expected to see its EPS tumble 73%. Excluding the energy sector, EPS is expected to rise 1.6% overall.Tech companies have long been the innovation trendsetters, turning in strong earnings that usually put the industry at or near the top of the best-performing groups in the S&P 500. Not now. In terms of earnings performance, tech is in the middle of the pack among the 10 industry groups in the S&P 500.""The tech sector is now more of a mirror of the S&P index as whole,"" said Gregory Harrison, earnings analyst at Thomson Reuters.The tech industry has been stuck in slow-growth mode at the same time it's going through a once-in-a-decade secular shift — the move to cloud computing — which has shattered old ways of using technology, says Evercore ISI's Whyman. Rather than buy large computer servers and storage systems for business operations, companies and other enterprises are lowering costs by turning to Internet-based cloud computing services provided by companies such as Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet.Cloud Computing Drives TechnologyCloud computing is the dominant force in technology and will continue to accelerate, says Whyman. Among other things, cloud computing has spurred the emergence of SaaS, provided on demand as needed. SaaS leaders include Salesforce.com (CRM).Moreover, many providers of cloud services are buying lower-cost hardware from Taiwan and mainland China, opting for stripped-down hardware of their own design instead of brand-name products. That is rattling some of the largest information technology companies, such as IBM, Cisco Systems (CSCO), Oracle (ORCL) and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), all of which are undergoing major transitions.This disruption is happening amid slower sales of PCs and now-slowing growth for smartphones and tablets.Global PC shipments fell 8.3% in the fourth quarter vs. Q4 2014, to just under 76 million units, according to preliminary results by market tracker Gartner. It was the fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year shipment declines. For the year, PC shipments fell 8% to 288.7 million units. Gartner expects PC shipments to fall this year as well, but only by 1%, and it anticipates a soft recovery later in 2016.Global semiconductor sales fell 2% in 2015 to $334 billion, Gartner says, attributed not just to PCs, but also in part to weakened demand for electronic equipment amid the cloud shift and the continuing impact of the strong dollar.Strong Dollar Hurts Tech ResultsThe strong dollar, which makes U.S. exports more expensive, is more difficult for tech companies than other sectors.""A big variable remains the U.S. dollar, as it has a huge impact on tech,"" said Whyman. ""Tech derives more revenue from outside the U.S. than any other S&P sector.""Apple, despite the popularity of its products and huge size, is not immune to the fallout. When Apple reports earnings on Tuesday, its performance in China will be closely watched. China accounted for an estimated 25% of all iPhone sales in 2015. Slower economic growth in China and slower sales of smartphones globally are expected to pressure its earnings growth. The consensus on Apple is EPS growth of 6% year over year, which would be its slowest growth in eight quarters.As always, analysts will focus on corporate guidance, and the outlook might be especially important in this earnings cycle amid a rough start to 2016 for global stock markets.""The range of uncertainty is widening, so there is a greater interest in clues as to what 2016 might hold,"" Whyman said.Among the 12 subsectors in the S&P 500 tech group, application software leads with an expected average EPS increase of 44%. The group includes Adobe Systems (ADBE) and Salesforce.com.The Internet software and services group is expected to have the second-best performance among the tech subsectors. This includes Facebook and Alphabet, which continue to ride the rising tide of mobile and online ad growth. Facebook is expected to show EPS growth of 26%, while Alphabet is expected to post growth of 18%.Friday, some of the biggest tech companies reporting earnings in the coming week rose ahead of the major stock market indexes.Apple stock lifted 5.3% to 101.42, Facebook gained 4% to 97.94, Amazon rose 3.7% to 596.38 and Microsoft logged a 3.6% boost to 52.29.

681,QCOM,"Apple (AAPL) chip supplier Qualcomm (QCOM) got a price target cut Wednesday despite this week's favorable regulatory ruling against a Tesla (TSLA) supplier, while Northrop Grumman (NOC) scored an upgrade, and UnitedHealth Group (UNH) was started with a bullish rating.Cowen cut Qualcomm's price target to 67 from 69 and maintained its outperform rating on the stock. Topeka Capital Markets also cut its price target on the Apple supplier to 52 from 61 and maintained its hold rating.On Monday, the U.S. International Trade Commission sided with Qualcomm and Samsung, upholding an earlier ruling that neither company violated Tesla chipmaker Nvidia's (NVDA) patents on graphics processing chips. Nvidia said it plans to appeal the decision.Qualcomm shares closed up 0.1% on the stock market today. Apple climbed 0.8%, Tesla rose 6% and Nvidia added 0.6%.Defense contractor Northrop Grumman rose 1% after it was upgraded to overweight from neutral by JPMorgan, which also raised its price target on the stock to 212 from 198.Recent consolidation in the defense industry has fueled speculation about whether a Northrop-Boeing (BA) merger might make sense, though the Pentagon is pushing for more power to block defense mergers and preserve competition.Boeing's stock price climbed 1% Wednesday.JPMorgan also upgraded fellow defense aerospace supplier B/E Aerospace (BEAV) to overweight from neutral.

698,QCOM,"Connect with Allison Gatlin on Twitter @IBD_AGatlin and on Facebook.The U.S. International Trade Commission sided with Apple (AAPL) supplier Qualcomm (QCOM) and Samsung on Monday, upholding an earlier ruling that neither violated Tesla (TSLA) chipmaker Nvidia's (NVDA) patents on graphics processing chips.An Nvidia spokesperson said the company could appeal.""While today's ruling ends this particular case in the ITC, we remain firm in our belief that our patents are valid and have been infringed and will look to appeal the ITC's decision,"" Nvidia wrote late Monday on its website.At least one analyst, in any case, didn't see a big impact. And in afternoon trading Tuesday, Nvidia stock was up more than 1.5%, above 33. Shares are up more than 60% over the past five months, touching a nearly eight-year high of 33.81 on Dec. 4.Santa Clara, Calif.-based Nvidia filed its initial complaint in September 2014, after private talks between itself and Samsung failed. Nvidia alleged eight patent violations, but later dropped the number to three.Nvidia most recently sought to ban Samsung smartphones and tablets, including those featuring Qualcomm chips, from sale in the U.S. Samsung argued that Nvidia's claims related to ""very specific and narrow aspects of graphics processing units.""The accused products represent 40% of Samsung's Android offerings, including 27% of its smartphone and 18% of its tablet markets, Samsung's attorneys argued in a Nov. 23 filing. Samsung, based in South Korea, estimated that its smaller peers would need six to nine months to fill the gap created by a U.S. import ban on those products.""A (ban) would leave one dominant MDM (mobile device management), Apple, and would lower competition among other MDMs,"" they wrote.But Nvidia noted that the ""mobile communication device and tablet market is intensely competitive, very fast-growing and dynamic, (and) Samsung's accused products comprise a relatively small share of the industry,"" according to a Nov. 23 filing.First Ruling In OctoberIn its filing late Monday, the trade agency upheld a judge's determination in October, siding with Samsung and Qualcomm.On Tuesday, RBC Capital analyst Mitch Steves maintained his 32 price target and sector perform rating on Nvidia stock.""The patent ruling removes a potential 'call option' or upside to Nvidia licensing/royalty revenue, (but) the announcement does not negatively impact our numbers,"" he wrote. ""Importantly, we continue to view Nvidia's automotive and virtual reality opportunity as robust.""Nvidia doesn't depend on licensing in its business model, Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang told investors during the company's November Q3 earnings conference call.On that point, Steves noted that a $66 million quarterly royalty from Intel (INTC) expires in 2017.""Other parts of Nvidia's business have grown in excess of the flat royalty business over the past three years,"" he wrote.

699,QCOM,"At the end of every year, business journalists and Wall Street analysts sit down and write up their boldest predictions for mergers and acquisitions in the coming year. And like the people shown riding hoverboards in YouTube videos, they're likely to fall on their butts.Tech M&A predictions are often wrong because they're born out of wishful thinking. They ignore market realities, CEO personalities and other factors that can make such deals tough to pull off.But they're fun to consider. So with that in mind, here's a roundup of the boldest predictions for tech company mergers and acquisitions in 2016.Apple Buys Tesla MotorsApple (AAPL) is rumored to be working on an electric car and it could ""dramatically accelerate"" those efforts if it bought Tesla Motors (TSLA), says Aaron Task, digital editor at Fortune magazine.""With over $200 billion cash on hand, the iPhone maker has more than ample resources to absorb the purchase, especially now that some of the bloom has come off Tesla's once-rosy stock,"" Task wrote. ""In addition to its automobile know-how, Apple gets access to Tesla's battery, which CEO Elon Musk claims can help change 'the entire energy infrastructure of the world.'""Plus, Musk would be a worthy heir to Apple co-founder Steve Jobs and would be ideally suited to be Apple's futurist, chief technologist and CEO-in-waiting, Task said.AT&T Buys YahooWeb giant Yahoo (YHOO) will be sold to telecom powerhouse AT&T (T), mirroring Verizon's (VZ) acquisition of AOL earlier in the year, predicts Chris Ciaccia, technology editor at TheStreet.""Yahoo's purchase of BrightRoll could help AT&T with its reported streaming service, as it seeks to have ads inserted into it,"" Ciaccia wrote. ""There are other players for Yahoo, like a media company or a private equity firm, but AT&T just makes too much sense to me.""GoPro Sold To Larger Tech FirmWith GoPro's (GPRO) stock depressed, a larger technology firm is likely to sweep in and buy the maker of action cameras, according to Orange Peel Investments.""With zero debt and $513 million in cash, the company has a clean slate for an LBO to come in, whisk them off their feet and take advantage of the company's ability to lever,"" the firm said in a post on Seeking Alpha. ""The obvious acquiring party in this transaction would be a larger technology or electronics outfit, such as an Apple, Samsung or Microsoft (MSFT). They could use the company's brand in a way similar to how Apple is using Beats. They could continue to have the brand name separate from the core brand and then eventually vertically integrate the two companies for future projects.""Comcast Will Try To Buy NetflixIn a prediction out of left field, Yahoo Tech editor Dan Tynan believes cable giant Comcast (CMCSA) will try to acquire Internet TV service Netflix (NFLX) or possibly vice versa.""Whether or not you're a cord-cutter, streaming media is the future of entertainment — and nobody streams bigger than Netflix, which accounted for nearly 40% of all Internet traffic last year. Since Big Cable can't beat the streamers at this game, the only thing left is for it to join them by acquisition,"" Tynan wrote. ""Comcast ($192 billion valuation) and Netflix ($42 billion) are the most logical candidates for an arranged marriage. While it stands to reason that the larger company will swallow the smaller one, it's not inconceivable that the reverse will happen — not unlike AOL's acquisition of Time Warner 15 years ago, but perhaps with better results.""Apple Buys A Movie StudioVariety magazine's writers and editors are predicting a lot of M&A activity in Hollywood in 2016. Most notably, they think Apple will buy a movie studio to support its goals for a subscription Internet video service.""With more than $200 billion in cash on hand, the Cupertino colossus is poised to rewrite the rules of the media game,"" the Variety staff wrote. ""Viacom (VIAB) or HBO might seem the likeliest prey, but Sony (SNE) is a juicier target, given the mix of hardware and programming under its hood.""Variety thinks Chinese Internet giant Alibaba Group (BABA) also is interested in buying a Hollywood player. Possible targets for Alibaba include Viacom, CBS (CBS), Lions Gate Entertainment (LGF) and DreamWorks Animation.However, John Malone is most likely to snap up Lions Gate and merge it with cable channel Starz (STRZA), Variety said.Time Warner (TWX), parent of HBO and Warner Bros., could become an M&A target in 2016, Variety said. One likely bidder would be 21st Century Fox (FOXA), the trade paper said.Intel Or Qualcomm Buys InvenSenseU.K.-based research firm CCS Insight makes a lot of annual tech industry predictions, including some about mergers and acquisitions.It predicts that Intel (INTC) or Qualcomm (QCOM) will acquire InvenSense (INVN) in 2016.""The acquisition follows a large fall in the market capitalization of InvenSense in the second half of 2015,"" CCS Insight said in a report. ""Its purchaser recognizes the opportunity to snap up InvenSense's assets in sensor technology. As sensors take on greater importance in the Internet of Things and wearable devices, the buyer integrates InvenSense's technology into a wider range of semiconductors.""CCS Insight also predicts that Samsung will acquire chipmaker GlobalFoundries by 2017.""GlobalFoundries is currently struggling to compete against Intel, Samsung and TSMC (TSM),"" it said. ""Chip manufacturing becomes increasingly capital- and scale-intensive, with huge pressure on capacity as demand balloons for silicon for the Internet of Things. Samsung's foundry business accounts for a growing proportion of the company's profit, and the acquisition helps cement Samsung's position in this area.""Dish Network Gets MarriedDish Network (DISH) will merge with someone in 2016, says Phillip Swann, president of TVPredictions.com.""The nation's second-largest satellite TV service needs help to stay competitive, and that assistance can only come from a merger,"" Swann wrote. Possible merger partners include T-Mobile (TMUS), Verizon, Amazon.com (AMZN) and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google.""Out of full disclosure, I have predicted in the past that Dish will merge with someone, and it hasn't happened yet,"" Swann said. ""But this time, well, this time I really think it will happen.""RELATED:Apple 2016 Predictions: Acquisitions, Accessories.Cloud, Virtual Reality Among Top Tech Trends For 2016.

701,QCOM,"A Deutsche Bank analyst's October prediction that Micron Technology (MU) will face two ""choppy"" quarters may come to fruition — the No. 5 chipmaker is expected late Tuesday to report a 75% year-over-year drop in earnings.Analyst Sidney Ho, however, said Micron could be helped by cost tailwinds and potential capital expenditure cuts by competing memory suppliers. Micron stock is down 60% for the year.For its fiscal Q1 ended early this month, Micron is expected to report 23 cents earnings per share ex items on $3.46 billion in sales, down 75% and 24%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier quarter.Three months ago, Micron guided to $3.35 billion to $3.6 billion in sales and 20-26 cents EPS minus items.Micron stock fell 2.7% on Monday, after the chipmaker announced the $3.2 billion deal to acquire Taiwan chipmaker Inotera Memories. But Micron rose 2% for the week, including rising a fraction on Friday.And at least six analysts reiterated buy ratings on Micron stock this week following the Inotera announcement.Per the agreement, Micron will pay 30 New Taiwan dollars, or 92 cents, per Inotera share. Micron already owns 33% of Inotera and the two companies have been memory chip partners for seven years.The acquisition is expected to be immediately accretive to Micron's EPS, free cash flow, gross margins and EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization). The companies have 60 days to terminate the agreement.M&As Breach $100 Bil MarkMicron's $3.2 billion Inotera acquisition is just a drop in the $100 billion-plus chip industry M&A bucket for 2015. Big deals included Apple (AAPL) supplier Avago's (AVGO) $37 billion offer for Broadcom and the $19 billion marriage between SanDisk (SNDK) and Western Digital (WDC).Analysts expect the M&A fever to continue into 2016 as the semiconductor industry faces slowing organic growth, rising costs and a limp global economy. Complicating the matter: China wants in on the action and Tsinghua Unigroup has pledged $47 billion to leapfrog Qualcomm (QCOM) to become the No. 3 chipmaker.The Tsinghua push is part of a larger effort by the Chinese government to ease reliance on foreign chips, in part to reduce cybersnooping concerns. Groups in Shanghai and Beijing are making similar efforts, pulling from a $100 billion, government-sponsored pool.This year, Tsinghua Unigroup reportedly made an unsolicited $23 billion bid for Micron. U.S. regulations likely would have stopped the theoretical merger and the offer seems to have fallen off the map.As M&A activity hits new fever pitches in 2016, analysts see smaller chip companies Xilinx (XLNX), Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM) and Cavium (CAVM) as possible takeover candidates.Connect with Allison Gatlin on Twitter @IBD_AGatlin and on Facebook.

Nasdaq volume rose a bit in the stock market today.Facebook (FB) shares rose after hours on better-than-expected quarterly results. EPS was 57 cents vs. estimates of 52 cents.In testimony in front of the House Financial Services Committee, Fed Chair Janet Yellen said a rate hike at the December meeting is a ""live possibility.""

Around the time of the last Fed meeting in late October, odds were around 33%.The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose 2 basis points to 2.23%. The dollar rallied against other currencies and the euro hit a three-month low.Among the day's big gainers, Tesla (TSLA) soared 11% despite reporting a wider-than-expected loss of 58 cents a share. Investors focused instead on comments from Tesla that orders are accelerating for its Model S sedan and its luxury crossover Model X.IBD Sector Leaders Paycom Software (PAYC) and Fleetmatics (FLTX) turned in solid performances. Paycom vaulted 17% on news quarterly profit jumped 60% to 8 cents a share. Sales rose 51% to $55.3 million. The provider of cloud-based, workforce management software also offered up bullish Q4 revenue guidance. Shares of Fleetmatics gained 7.5%, also on strong earnings.Reports are also due from HubSpot (HUBS), Epam Systems (EPAM) and Qualcomm (QCOM).At the New York Mercantile Exchange, December crude oil futures slumped $1.58, or 3.3%, to $46.32 a barrel after U.S. government data showed that crude inventories rose for the sixth straight week.Follow Ken Shreve on Twitter: @IBD_KShreve and on Facebook

724,QCOM,"Flipping The Paradigm
"
725,QCOM,"China plans to flip a longstanding paradigm. The country consumes roughly half the world's $350 billion in chips, but only accounts for 2.5% of the sector's revenue, according to Nanochip Fab Solutions . Chips, in fact, are China's biggest import, says Nanochip.
"
726,QCOM,"In June 2014, the government pledged to curb China's reliance on foreign semiconductors.
"
727,QCOM,"By 2020, China aims to generate 350 billion yuan ($55 billion) in domestic chip revenue, seeking a compound annual growth rate of 20%. No more than 10 years later, the country wants a top-tier semiconductor company. Thus, the National Semiconductor Industry Investment Fund was born.
"
728,QCOM,"Tsinghua is one of 16 shareholders of the fund — a $100 billion pot of which 60% will be directed toward manufacturing acquisitions, according to Semi.org. Groups in Shanghai and Beijing, too, have planned hefty chip investments.
"
729,QCOM,"But Tsinghua has been particularly vocal about its goal. Last month, Chairman Zhao Weiguo told Reuters the group will invest $47 billion over five years to become the world's No. 3 chipmaker, behind No. 1 Intel (INTC) and Samsung.
"
730,QCOM,"""If you can't be the top-three giant, it will be very hard to develop your business in the chip industry,"" he told Reuters. ""The next five years is key. ... there is an enormous market there.""
"
731,QCOM,"Intel and Samsung Electronics have market valued near $164 billion and $160 billion, respectively. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) follows in value at $118 billion, but it's a manufacturer that doesn't design its own chips, so it's in a little bit of a different market, with thinner profit margins. Qualcomm is No. 4 in chip company market value, near $73 billion.
"
732,QCOM,"""Qualcomm is most at risk because they are already seeing their dominant position in cellphones being challenged, with Samsung and Apple and in the Chinese smartphone market,"" Lidow said. ""They are most vulnerable, for sure.""
"
733,QCOM,"Tangling With U.S. Government
"
734,QCOM,"Tsinghua already has invested billions in chip acquisitions, buying China chipmakers Spreadtrum Communications for $1.8 billion and RDA Microelectronics for $900 million in 2013 and 2014. But getting its hands on a U.S. company is much more difficult, since the U.S. aims to protect its chip industry trade secrets and intellectual property.
"
735,QCOM,"In August, Tsinghua made an unsolicited $23 billion bid for Boise, Idaho-based Micron, showing its serious interest in flash memory technology. Wall Street scoffed, saying the U.S. Department of Defense would block that transaction. And the informal bid seemingly has gone nowhere.
"
736,QCOM,"""That's one of the reasons Chinese fabs aren't up to par with U.S. fabs, because they're somewhat restricted as to the technology they have access to,"" Semiconductor Advisors analyst Robert Maire told IBD.
"
737,QCOM,"The Bureau of Industry and Security tightly controls exports to protect national security and the U.S. economy. Semiconductors are a heavily regulated resource, appearing 41 times on the Bureau's controlled list.
"
738,QCOM,"But it's possible Tsinghua found a loophole.
"
739,QCOM,"Last month, Tsinghua invested $3.8 billion in Irvine, Calif.-based Western Digital (WDC), a month after Western Digital agreed to buy Milpitas, Calif.-based flash chip maker SanDisk (SNDK) for $19 billion.
"
740,QCOM,"By investing in Western Digital, Tsinghua got itself that much closer to U.S. chip patents, Summit Research analyst Srini Sundararajan told IBD.
"
741,QCOM,"""Tsinghua put in $3.8 billion into Western Digital so they would have SanDisk technology,"" he said.
"
742,QCOM,"China could also make a play for Milpitas, Calif.-based GlobalFoundries, the manufacturing spinoff of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) with fabs in Singapore, Germany and the U.S. Oil-rich Abu Dhabi owns the company and might be looking for a buyer.
"
743,QCOM,"To compete with the mature U.S. semiconductor market, Tsinghua ""needs to bulk up,"" Maire said. Fabs such as GlobalFoundries and Taiwan Semiconductor carry significant heft.
"
744,QCOM,"""With Micron, U.S. legislators would never let that go through,"" he said. ""But (Tsinghua) could get around (U.S. regulations) and get around the technological hurdles by cutting a deal with GlobalFoundries.
"
745,QCOM,"""I wouldn't call it subterfuge, but it would be an interesting back door for China to get its hands on crucial U.S. semiconductor technology.""
"
746,QCOM,"'Mattson And Chinese Dragon'
"
747,QCOM,"Chinese involvement aside, 2015 marked a record M&A year for the rapidly consolidating semiconductor industry. The trend looks to continue in 2016, Lidow said.
"
748,QCOM,"""Just about any of the second- and third-tier semiconductors are probably going to be involved in M&A activity over the next couple of years — Cypress Semiconductor (CY), Micron, GlobalFoundries, Maxim, Xilinx,"" he said.
"
749,QCOM,"Maire also cites Axcelis Technologies (ACLS), Rudolph Technologies (RTEC), Nanometrics (NANO), Nova Measuring (NVMI) and Ultratech (UTEK) as potential acquisition targets.
"
750,QCOM,"Chip giants Texas Instruments (TXN), Intel and Samsung are safe — for the time being, Lidow said. He estimates it would take a Chinese company five years after a major acquisition to make any dominant inroads in the semiconductor world.
"
751,QCOM,"Beijing-based E-Town Dragon Semiconductor Industry Investment Center, not Tsinghua, has already begun its efforts on that cycle, this month announcing an agreement to acquire Mattson Technology (MTSN), a maker of chip-manufacturing gear based in Fremont, Calif., for $12.2 million.
"
752,QCOM,"Acquiring Mattson is just a drop in the ""proverbial bucket,"" Maire wrote in a research report. E-Town's plans remain veiled, but regulators will likely approve the acquisition, as ""Mattson has no advanced technology the U.S. government would be concerned about,"" he wrote.
"
753,QCOM,"""It will be an interesting test as this is the first Chinese acquisition of a U.S. semiconductor company,"" Maire wrote. But ""this is not a very bold start, buying the worst equipment company as compared to the very bold bid by the Chinese to buy Micron.""

""They are most vulnerable, for sure.""Tangling With U.S. GovernmentTsinghua already has invested billions in chip acquisitions, buying China chipmakers Spreadtrum Communications for $1.8 billion and RDA Microelectronics for $900 million in 2013 and 2014. But getting its hands on a U.S. company is much more difficult, since the U.S. aims to protect its chip industry trade secrets and intellectual property.In August, Tsinghua made an unsolicited $23 billion bid for Boise, Idaho-based Micron, showing its serious interest in flash memory technology. Wall Street scoffed, saying the U.S. Department of Defense would block that transaction. And the informal bid seemingly has gone nowhere.""That's one of the reasons Chinese fabs aren't up to par with U.S. fabs, because they're somewhat restricted as to the technology they have access to,"" Semiconductor Advisors analyst Robert Maire told IBD.The Bureau of Industry and Security tightly controls exports to protect national security and the U.S. economy. Semiconductors are a heavily regulated resource, appearing 41 times on the Bureau's controlled list.But it's possible Tsinghua found a loophole.Last month, Tsinghua invested $3.8 billion in Irvine, Calif.-based Western Digital (WDC), a month after Western Digital agreed to buy Milpitas, Calif.-based flash chip maker SanDisk (SNDK) for $19 billion.By investing in Western Digital, Tsinghua got itself that much closer to U.S. chip patents, Summit Research analyst Srini Sundararajan told IBD.""Tsinghua put in $3.8 billion into Western Digital so they would have SanDisk technology,"" he said.China could also make a play for Milpitas, Calif.-based GlobalFoundries, the manufacturing spinoff of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) with fabs in Singapore, Germany and the U.S. Oil-rich Abu Dhabi owns the company and might be looking for a buyer.To compete with the mature U.S. semiconductor market, Tsinghua ""needs to bulk up,"" Maire said. Fabs such as GlobalFoundries and Taiwan Semiconductor carry significant heft.""With Micron, U.S. legislators would never let that go through,"" he said. ""But (Tsinghua) could get around (U.S. regulations) and get around the technological hurdles by cutting a deal with GlobalFoundries.""I wouldn't call it subterfuge, but it would be an interesting back door for China to get its hands on crucial U.S. semiconductor technology.""'Mattson And Chinese Dragon'Chinese involvement aside, 2015 marked a record M&A year for the rapidly consolidating semiconductor industry. The trend looks to continue in 2016, Lidow said.""Just about any of the second- and third-tier semiconductors are probably going to be involved in M&A activity over the next couple of years — Cypress Semiconductor (CY), Micron, GlobalFoundries, Maxim, Xilinx,"" he said.Maire also cites Axcelis Technologies (ACLS), Rudolph Technologies (RTEC), Nanometrics (NANO), Nova Measuring (NVMI) and Ultratech (UTEK) as potential acquisition targets.Chip giants Texas Instruments (TXN), Intel and Samsung are safe — for the time being, Lidow said. He estimates it would take a Chinese company five years after a major acquisition to make any dominant inroads in the semiconductor world.Beijing-based E-Town Dragon Semiconductor Industry Investment Center, not Tsinghua, has already begun its efforts on that cycle, this month announcing an agreement to acquire Mattson Technology (MTSN), a maker of chip-manufacturing gear based in Fremont, Calif., for $12.2 million.Acquiring Mattson is just a drop in the ""proverbial bucket,"" Maire wrote in a research report. E-Town's plans remain veiled, but regulators will likely approve the acquisition, as ""Mattson has no advanced technology the U.S. government would be concerned about,"" he wrote.""It will be an interesting test as this is the first Chinese acquisition of a U.S. semiconductor company,"" Maire wrote. But ""this is not a very bold start, buying the worst equipment company as compared to the very bold bid by the Chinese to buy Micron.""He added: ""Even if the Micron bid was doomed from the start, it was certainly headline grabbing.""Connect with Allison Gatlin on Twitter @IBD_AGatlin and on Facebook.

827,QCOM,"Wall Street pitted No. 1 chipmaker Intel (INTC) against Apple (AAPL) chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM) on Friday in a battle for data-center market share.The clash comes as Intel, after the close Tuesday, is expected to report roughly in-line Q3 revenue and an 11% decline in earnings per share ex items vs. the year-earlier quarter.Santa Clara, Calif.-based Intel has owned the market for chips that power data-center servers, Richard Windsor, an analyst with Edison Investment Research, wrote in a research report Friday. On Thursday, Qualcomm announced an ARM-based data-center system-on-a-chip.""Over the years, server processors have consolidated in the hands of a couple of heavyweights, so competition could do the industry some good,"" Qualcomm wrote on its website.San Diego-based Qualcomm, with help from partners Xilinix (XLNX) and Mellanox (MLNX), could pose a threat to Intel, said Windsor. Intel sells $12 billion to $14 billion annually to data centers and enjoys 90% of the market, he said.""Qualcomm is the king of execution, and if it can get a foot in the door, then there could be real trouble on the horizon for Intel,"" Windsor wrote.Qualcomm, though, is planning a realignment and in July announced it would cut 15% of its workforce, or some 4,700 jobs.An ARM processor in general uses less power and generates less heat than its Intel counterpart.""The net result is substantially lower running costs because power is far and away the biggest operating expense of a data center,"" Windsor wrote.To be truly competitive, Qualcomm will need to completely rewrite its software. But that's what big ecosystems like Google (GOOG), Facebook (FB) and Apple want, he wrote.""This gives them the ability to do whatever suits them in the data center,"" he explained.MKM analyst Ian Ing, on the other hand, sees Intel and Qualcomm as complementary. Their cooperation ""increasingly makes sense,"" he wrote in a report.The semiconductor sphere will likely see more consolidation ""with Intel potentially playing a role,"" Ing predicted.Intel To Report Q3Intel is expected to report an 11% decline in Q3 earnings per share vs. Q3 2014, to 59 cents, according to the consensus of 48 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Analysts expect $14.2 billion in revenue, down 2.5%.Three months ago, Intel guided for $13.8 billion to $14.8 billion in revenue.MKM's Ing forecasts an easy beat for Intel.""Due to low expectations, we think results and guidance at consensus will be viewed as positive,"" he wrote. ""Given the lack of follow-through to recent PC build activity, investors question whether Intel set a high bar with implied Q4 revenue up 4% to 5%.""Intel is beating the odds of the weak PC market, he wrote.""We think Intel was early to fully de-stock (its PC channel inventory) compared to broad-based semi(conductor companies),"" he wrote.Also, demand remains strong in the hyper-scale cloud market, and Intel will likely focus on data centers in 2016, Ing wrote. Servers bring in about 30% of Intel's revenue, Nomura analyst Romit Shah wrote in a research note.Ing rates Intel stock a buy, with a price target of 40. Shah is neutral on Intel stock and has a 33 price target.Intel stock fell 1.2% Friday, to 32.14.

828,QCOM,"Apple (AAPL) chip suppliers tumbled Monday on Wall Street after a German iPhone 6S chip supplier guided Q4 revenue growth down to single digits, a day before Apple is expected to report colossal earnings.Dialog Semiconductor's 20% dip in shares could also hurt its $4.6 billion attempt to acquire Silicon Valley chip gear maker Atmel (ATML). In September, Dialog valued Atmel at $10.42 per share. Now, the deal is worth 20% less.In early trading, Atmel stock dropped more than 10%.For Q4, Dialog guided to $430 million to $460 million in revenue, which would be down 1% to up 6% vs. the year-earlier quarter.Apple stock dropped more than 3% by early afternoon on the stock market today. But, the iPhone peddler's chip suppliers fell harder. Cirrus Logic (CRUS) stock took the biggest hit at 13%, ahead of the company's scheduled Q4 earnings report Wednesday.Qorvo (QRVO) stock dipped 8%. Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) stock fell nearly 6%. Shares of Avago (AVGO) and Broadcom (BRCM) — set to merge next year — were down almost 5%. Qualcomm (QCOM) stock suffered the least, down 3%.Late Tuesday, Apple is expected to report $51.1 billion in Q4 sales, up 21% vs. the year-earlier quarter, according to 50 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. The consensus also models 32% earnings growth to $1.88 earnings per share minus items.Both measures would show decceleration. Earnings have topped 40% growth for three sequential quarters. Revenue growth hasn't dipped below 25% over the same time period.Apple's December guidance is key and could dispel worries of an ""iPhone 6 hangover,"" FBR analyst Daniel Ives wrote in a research report.""We view tomorrow's earnings as a seminal event for (CEO Tim) Cook to prove the iPhone 6S skeptics wrong with a sub 70 million iPhone guide viewed as bearish,"" he wrote.Earlier this month, Apple chip suppliers took a severe hit upon reports that, despite then-record iPhone 6S series shipments, the smartphone giant had stepped down its Q4 intelligence-chip orders.Then, insiders said Apple would reduce its Q4 expectations to 65 million to 70 million smartphones sold.Connect with Allison Gatlin on Twitter @IBD_AGatlin and on Facebook.

Both measures, however, beat the consensus for $5.21 billion and 86 cents.Qualcomm guided to $5.2 billion to $6 billion in sales and 80-90 cents EPS minus items for the current quarter. Year over year, sales would be down 15% to 27% and EPS would fall 37% at the midpoint of guidance. Wall Street saw $5.79 billion and $1.08.At least four analysts lowered their price targets on Qualcomm stock on Thursday. Northland Securities, on the other hand, upped the bank's price target on Qualcomm stock to 62.50 from 60.'Refusing To Report Royalties'Rosenblatt Securities analyst Jun Zhang expressed concern that Chinese smartphone makers would continue to be a sticking point for Qualcomm's technology licensing business.Qualcomm settled litigation with the Chinese National Development and Reform Commission in February. The NRDC began investigating Qualcomm — saying it violated China's anti-monopoly law — in 2013. The resolution let Qualcomm resume licensing in China under new government-approved terms.For fiscal 2016, Qualcomm guided to $7.3 billion to $8 billion in licensing revenue, of a total $50 billion to $58 billion expected for the year.Zhang sees Chinese smartphone makers feeling pricing pressure as the market flattens in 2016.""It is our view that it will be more difficult to collect royalty fees due to increasing pricing pressures on Chinese OEMs, potentially giving them the incentive to fake their number of smartphone shipments,"" Zhang wrote in a research report.Underreporting by some of these licensees has been a recurring theme, Qualcomm President David Aberle told analysts Wednesday during the conference call. During Q4, total reported device sales came in about $200 million below guidance ""primarily as a result of the Chinese licensees I just mentioned refusing to report royalties.""Tough NegotiationsDuring Q4, Qualcomm closed new licensing agreements with ZTE and TCL, two major Chinese OEMs, CEO Steven Mollenkopf told analysts during Wednesday's conference call. In 2015, Qualcomm signed 60 agreements with Chinese OEMs, Aberle said.Once new agreements are in place, the licensees will be required to make catch-up payments, Aberle said. But ongoing negotiations have been tough and long-lasting.""We believe in connection with the negotiations, (some licensees) have stopped reporting certain of their sales and royalties or did not report their sales and royalties in a manner that allows us to record revenue,"" Aberle said.William Blair analyst Anil Doradla noted Qualcomm is, inarguably, ""entering a period of uncertainty."" Still, he still likes the company's capital return program that is focused on returning 75% of free cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends.Qualcomm is also on track to cut $1.4 billion in spending as part of its restructuring program, Doradla wrote in a report.Doradla rated Qualcomm stock an outperform.

832,QCOM,"Apple (AAPL) supplier Avago Technologies (AVGO) might jettison its unprofitable industrial segment in lieu of a renewed focus on smartphone chips, MKM analyst Ian Ing suggests.This comes as Avago and fellow Apple chip suppliers like Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), Qorvo (QRVO), NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), Qualcomm (QCOM) and Cirrus Logic (CRUS) face continued constraints from slowing growth in the iPhone market, Ing wrote.""Avago is increasingly exposed to the challenges of cyclicality at both Apple and broader semiconductors,"" Ing wrote in a recent research report.The industry is expecting a 10%-15% decline in March-quarter iPhone sales, and a Credit Suisse analyst suggested earlier this month that Apple had cut its November orders by 10%. Shares of Apple and its suppliers tumbled on that report.Ing sees Avago as having a slim chance of guiding Q1 above the consensus when it reports its fiscal Q4 earnings after the close Dec. 2. If its guidance falls short, that would reflect hampered iPhone sales and Avago's sale of its optical module manufacturing business to China-based tech manufacturer Foxconn Interconnect Technologies, Ing wrote.He maintained his buy rating on Avago stock but dropped his price target to 158 from 159.Record-Smashing Sales, EPSFor its Q4 ended Oct. 31, Avago is expected to report a record $1.85 billion in sales, up 15% vs. the year-earlier quarter, and $2.38 earnings per share ex items, up 20%.Three months ago, Avago guided to $1.84 billion in sales, plus or minus $25 million.For the year, the consensus of 24 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters sees Avago pulling in $6.9 billion in sales and $8.84 EPS minus items, up 60% and 80%, respectively, vs. 2014 figures.Ing looks for Avago to return to aggressive M&A after it completes the Broadcom deal. In May, Avago agreed to buy Broadcom for $37 billion — the largest pure-tech merger ever until Dell and EMC (EMC) last month announced their $67 billion combination.""Much of Avago's story continues to revolve around how fast it returns to large acquisitions as it de-levers post-Broadcom,"" Ing wrote.Rampant chip sector M&A action broke records in 2015 as expenses skyrocket and growth slows. Possibly to counteract rising costs and add new vertical markets, Avago, a fabless company, submitted a winning bid earlier this month for an idle Eugene, Ore., fabrication (chip manufacturing) plant, Ing wrote.""We see this as a sign that Avago plans to have the benefits of scale and low-cost, in-sourced manufacturing as the semiconductor industry matures,"" he wrote.Avago is in IBD's Electronic-Semiconductor Fabless Group, where it has the fifth-highest Composite Rating of 92, out of a possible 99.

906,QCOM,"With U.S. companies headed for a record year of share repurchases, experts are split over whether buybacks are the logical result of excess capital, or if they come at the expense of growth initiatives.
"
907,QCOM,"A number of high-profile companies have implemented aggressive buyback programs in recent quarters, spanning all sectors of the economy.
"
908,QCOM,"They include tech giants such as Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT), health care leaders like Express Scripts (ESRX) and AbbVie (ABBV), manufacturers like Boeing (BA) and General Motors (GM), financial leaders like Wells Fargo (WFC), and consumer stocks such as Nike (NKE) and Wendy's (WEN).
"
909,QCOM,"Nike announced a $12 billion buyback program on Thursday, along with a 14% dividend hike.
"
910,QCOM,"Apple bought back $36 billion in shares in fiscal 2015 after buying $45 billion in stock in 2014.
"
911,QCOM,"Not surprisingly, buybacks have become the focus of intense media coverage in recent weeks.
"
912,QCOM,"Critics say more of that money should be reinvested into research and development initiatives as well as new products, technologies and services. This would contribute to long-term growth and feed economic expansion, they say. Critics also say that executives use buybacks to flatter financial results.
"
913,QCOM,"But defenders say returning money to shareholders is a good use of money that's left over after capital has already been allocated to normal business expenses.
"
914,QCOM,"In today's environment, many companies are ""still left with a large amount of excess capital,"" even after investing in growth initiatives, said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist for State Street Global Advisors' U.S. Intermediary Business Group.
"
915,QCOM,"""They are choosing to redeploy the money to investors,"" he told IBD. ""When done the right way, buybacks are a good capital allocation. There are a lot of misperceptions around share buybacks.""
"
916,QCOM,"Record Buyback Pace
"
917,QCOM,"What's certain is this: A whole lot of money is going toward buybacks and dividends lately.
"
918,QCOM,"The total dollar amount of dividends and stock buybacks is on track to reach a new high this year and could soar above $1 trillion for the first time, according to industry estimates.
"
919,QCOM,"The percentage of operating cash flow used to buy back shares is at its highest level since 2007, Arone says. He calls that a ""watershed year"" for buybacks. That was also just before the U.S. fell into a sharp recession and bear market.
"
920,QCOM,"""Some look at 2007 as a kind of peak year,"" he said. ""This year's percentage of operating cash flow used for buybacks is still below 2007. But (2015) would be the largest year of all time in absolute dollar terms.""
"
921,QCOM,"A recent investigative report from Reuters noted that nearly 60% of the 3,297 publicly traded non-financial U.S. companies it examined have bought back shares since 2010.
"
922,QCOM,"In fiscal 2014, spending on buybacks and dividends surpassed the companies' combined net income for the first time outside of a recessionary period, Reuters said. Spending kept climbing higher for the 613 companies that have already reported for fiscal 2015. That suggests that corporations are relying more heavily on cheap interest rates to use debt to fund buybacks and dividends.
"
923,QCOM,"FactSet Research reports that 75% of all companies in the S&P 500 bought back shares and paid dividends in the trailing 12 months at the end of the second quarter, the most recent data available. About $555 billion was spent by S&P 500 firms on share repurchases in the same period.
"
924,QCOM,"The information technology sector spent the most money on buybacks in the second quarter, FactSet said, led by Apple, Microsoft, Qualcomm (QCOM) and Oracle (ORCL).
"
925,QCOM,"Meanwhile, U.S. companies issued $107.9 billion in dividends during Q3. That was up 23% from Q2 and established a new record, according to data from Henderson Global Investors.
"
926,QCOM,"Why is all this money going toward buybacks and dividends?
"
927,QCOM,"The most basic answer is that the money is there, and something has to be done with it.
"
928,QCOM,"""You have low interest rates and record profits,"" Arone said. ""This has resulted in corporations at peak levels in terms of having a lot of cash on hand.""
"
929,QCOM,"In some cases, activist investors are pressuring companies to reward investors with that money, analysts say. In others, executives are simply gun-shy about investing in products and services that might not pay off over the long term.
"
930,QCOM,"Another reason some companies are buying back outstanding shares is that doing so fattens up per-share earnings.
"
931,QCOM,"Innovation Shortchanged?
"
932,QCOM,"The worry in some quarters is that buybacks come at the expense of product development, innovation and long-term growth.
"
933,QCOM,"""The U.S. is behind on production of everything from flat-panel TVs to semiconductors and solar photovoltaic cells,"" Gary Pisano, a professor at Harvard Business School, told Reuters. He's also the author of ""Producing Prosperity: Why America Needs a Manufacturing Renaissance.""
"
934,QCOM,"Reuters reported that among the 1,000 or so firms it tracked that buy back shares and report R&D spending, the share of net income spent on innovation has averaged less than 50% since 2009. That com pares to over 60% during the 1990s.
"
935,QCOM,"But not all data show such a grim view, Arone said. ""There's a bunch of data showing R&D growing at its fastest level in 50 years. There's this misperception that companies are not reinvesting or spending on business growth. But many companies do continue to reinvest in their businesses.""
"
936,QCOM,"He also says that while buybacks can boost a company's EPS, research from S&P Dow Jones Indices shows that on a weighted basis, recent S&P 500 EPS gains ""are built on profits — not buybacks.""
"
937,QCOM,"A recent report from Deutsche Bank found that S&P 500 per-share profits since 2012 have risen by 6.2% annually on average, of which just 1.6 percentage points are from buybacks. That fell to 1.2 points in Q3.
"
938,QCOM,"Misperceptions about buybacks are due to a couple of factors, Arone says.
"
939,QCOM,"""Global economic growth has been sluggish, and therefore folks equate that sluggishness with a lack of business investment,"" he said. ""There's also been a lack of any meaningful wage growth. There's this view that we would be accelerating much more quickly had businesses been investing more, but I'm not convinced that's accurate.""
"
940,QCOM,"If economic growth is sluggish, the return on capital may be low, so returning cash to shareholders may be a sound decision.
"
941,QCOM,"That's not to say there aren't cases where companies issue buybacks and dividends at their detriment.
"
942,QCOM,"""If a company is borrowing aggressively or levering its balance sheet to buy back stock, that is not necessarily a good strategy,"" Arone said. ""Or if a company buys back its stock to offset the dilutive effects of stock-based compensation of employees, that's not a good strategy, either.""
"
943,QCOM,"But those are the exceptions rather than the rule, he said. ""To say that's what's happening broadly is, in my mind, an exaggeration.""With U.S. companies headed for a record year of share repurchases, experts are split over whether buybacks are the logical result of excess capital, or if they come at the expense of growth initiatives.A number of high-profile companies have implemented aggressive buyback programs in recent quarters, spanning all sectors of the economy.They include tech giants such as Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT), health care leaders like Express Scripts (ESRX) and AbbVie (ABBV), manufacturers like Boeing (BA) and General Motors (GM), financial leaders like Wells Fargo (WFC), and consumer stocks such as Nike (NKE) and Wendy's (WEN).Nike announced a $12 billion buyback program on Thursday, along with a 14% dividend hike.Apple bought back $36 billion in shares in fiscal 2015 after buying $45 billion in stock in 2014.Not surprisingly, buybacks have become the focus of intense media coverage in recent weeks.Critics say more of that money should be reinvested into research and development initiatives as well as new products, technologies and services.

""This year's percentage of operating cash flow used for buybacks is still below 2007. But (2015) would be the largest year of all time in absolute dollar terms.""A recent investigative report from Reuters noted that nearly 60% of the 3,297 publicly traded non-financial U.S. companies it examined have bought back shares since 2010.In fiscal 2014, spending on buybacks and dividends surpassed the companies' combined net income for the first time outside of a recessionary period, Reuters said. Spending kept climbing higher for the 613 companies that have already reported for fiscal 2015. That suggests that corporations are relying more heavily on cheap interest rates to use debt to fund buybacks and dividends.FactSet Research reports that 75% of all companies in the S&P 500 bought back shares and paid dividends in the trailing 12 months at the end of the second quarter, the most recent data available. About $555 billion was spent by S&P 500 firms on share repurchases in the same period.The information technology sector spent the most money on buybacks in the second quarter, FactSet said, led by Apple, Microsoft, Qualcomm (QCOM) and Oracle (ORCL).Meanwhile, U.S. companies issued $107.9 billion in dividends during Q3. That was up 23% from Q2 and established a new record, according to data from Henderson Global Investors.Why is all this money going toward buybacks and dividends?The most basic answer is that the money is there, and something has to be done with it.""You have low interest rates and record profits,"" Arone said. ""This has resulted in corporations at peak levels in terms of having a lot of cash on hand.""In some cases, activist investors are pressuring companies to reward investors with that money, analysts say. In others, executives are simply gun-shy about investing in products and services that might not pay off over the long term.Another reason some companies are buying back outstanding shares is that doing so fattens up per-share earnings.Innovation Shortchanged?The worry in some quarters is that buybacks come at the expense of product development, innovation and long-term growth.""The U.S. is behind on production of everything from flat-panel TVs to semiconductors and solar photovoltaic cells,"" Gary Pisano, a professor at Harvard Business School, told Reuters. He's also the author of ""Producing Prosperity: Why America Needs a Manufacturing Renaissance.""Reuters reported that among the 1,000 or so firms it tracked that buy back shares and report R&D spending, the share of net income spent on innovation has averaged less than 50% since 2009. That com pares to over 60% during the 1990s.But not all data show such a grim view, Arone said. ""There's a bunch of data showing R&D growing at its fastest level in 50 years. There's this misperception that companies are not reinvesting or spending on business growth. But many companies do continue to reinvest in their businesses.""He also says that while buybacks can boost a company's EPS, research from S&P Dow Jones Indices shows that on a weighted basis, recent S&P 500 EPS gains ""are built on profits — not buybacks.""A recent report from Deutsche Bank found that S&P 500 per-share profits since 2012 have risen by 6.2% annually on average, of which just 1.6 percentage points are from buybacks. That fell to 1.2 points in Q3.Misperceptions about buybacks are due to a couple of factors, Arone says.""Global economic growth has been sluggish, and therefore folks equate that sluggishness with a lack of business investment,"" he said. ""There's also been a lack of any meaningful wage growth. There's this view that we would be accelerating much more quickly had businesses been investing more, but I'm not convinced that's accurate.""If economic growth is sluggish, the return on capital may be low, so returning cash to shareholders may be a sound decision.That's not to say there aren't cases where companies issue buybacks and dividends at their detriment.""If a company is borrowing aggressively or levering its balance sheet to buy back stock, that is not necessarily a good strategy,"" Arone said. ""Or if a company buys back its stock to offset the dilutive effects of stock-based compensation of employees, that's not a good strategy, either.""But those are the exceptions rather than the rule, he said. ""To say that's what's happening broadly is, in my mind, an exaggeration.""

1034,QCOM,"Apple (AAPL) iPhone fans could get their wish for longer battery life with the next iPhone based on a report that it is using a more power-efficient wireless chip. For the iPhone 6S, Apple has selected a new LTE chip from Qualcomm (QCOM) that is capable of delivering twice the download speeds of the chip used in the current iPhone 6, 9to5Mac reported Wednesday. That means faster downloads of apps, music, movies and Web pages.The Qualcomm MDM9635M chip can download content at a rate of 300 megabits per second when connected to an LTE network. Today's iPhone 6 is only capable of downloading files at 150 mbps.The new Qualcomm chip is more power efficient, which should translate to better battery life, 9to5Mac said. Plus, the motherboard that includes the chip is narrower and more compact, which could allow for a slightly bigger battery, the website said.A recent survey of iPhone users by RBC Capital Markets found that better battery life was the No. 1 most requested feature for the next iPhone.The next iteration of the iPhone is expected to be released this September, as has been the custom for Apple. The new handsets reportedly are already in production in China.RELATED:Apple Watch interest sinks as iPhone demand stays strongSynaptics rocked by Apple iPhone chip report.

1048,QCOM,"Expect to see lots of flying camera drones this holiday season, which Dougherty & Co. predicts will be the ""Christmas of the drone."" This year, Yuneec will join Parrot and DJI in offering aerial drones at Best Buy (BBY) stores, Dougherty analyst Charles Anderson said in a report Tuesday.Also, market leader DJI might offer its lowest-end drone, the Phantom 2, at Wal-Mart (WMT) and Sam's Club stores, he said. The Phantom 2 costs about $700, but could be discounted for the holidays, Anderson said.Anderson also expects to see a large presence at retail this holiday season from 3D Robotics, aka 3DR.To date, the market for personal drones and quadcopters has been largely commercial. Companies and professionals are using drones for aerial cinematography, mapping, search and rescue, security and monitoring, and other applications.The Federal Aviation Administration is currently drafting regulations for commercial drone use in U.S. airspace. Those rules are expected to be completed this year, but could push into 2016, Anderson said. In the meantime, the FAA is granting exemptions to companies for commercial drone use.""As of July, 70% of the exemptions have been to companies using DJI drones,"" he said. ""So even though DJI may be perceived as a consumer drone company, it has wide commercial use.""Action camera maker GoPro (GPRO) is looking to play in the emerging consumer drone market, Anderson said. It is expected to come out with a drone, possibly called Karma, in the first half of 2016.Many drone makers outfit their aircraft with attachments for GoPro cameras, but increasingly are using their own cameras.""GoPro has the opportunity to dominate the consumer drone market because 1) no one seems as focused on the consumer as they are, 2) they have strong branding and 3) there is demand from their action camera customers for an accompanying drone,"" Anderson said.A chief beneficiary of the growing drone market has been Ambarella (AMBA), a maker of video processing chips used by GoPro and other camera manufacturers. But Qualcomm (QCOM) has just jumped into the market with a competing chip aimed at the drone market.Qualcomm's chip, Snapdragon Flight, currently is targeted at the low end of the drone market, where Ambarella doesn't really play, Anderson said.Qualcomm announced last week that Chinese drone maker Yuneec will come out with a drone powered by Snapdragon Flight in early 2016. This comes after Ambarella announced its first win with Yuneec for its Typhoon Q500 drone, Anderson said.Yuneec is pursuing multiple product classes of drones (good-better-best) and the Qualcomm chip will likely end up in an entry-level device costing about $500, he said.Drone makers like Yuneec seem to be opting for Ambarella chips for drones costing above $500 because of their superior video and power consumption features, Anderson said.The drone market might end up mimicking the Internet protocol security camera market where companies like HiSilicon dominate the low end of the market, while Ambarella dominates the high end and has midrange customers as well, Anderson said.""There is a void to be filled on the lower-end of consumer drones (let's say, $500 and below) to have a low cost system-on-a-chip (SoC) that speeds time to market (video, flight control and connectivity all integrated),"" he said. ""This is the niche for Qualcomm to fill. The opportunity for Ambarella to render Qualcomm irrelevant would be to add computer vision processing to its chip that allows a drone to sense and avoid objects (trees, power lines, etc.). We believe the company is hard at work incorporating those features into its road-map and management is confident they can do so in a way that is more power efficient than Snapdragon Flight.""RELATED:Google, Amazon Wrestle With Drone-Traffic Challenges.Flying cameras to lift GoPro stock, Citi says.Commercial Drone Sales Set To Soar.

""It will take several years for China to disrupt new semiconductor markets, but disruptions — notably margin risk — could end up being significant for established players and for the global chip market overall.""Morgan Stanley analysts said China is not spreading its investments broadly, but instead pushing for ""national champions"" in semiconductor segments.""These include one national manufacturing champion Semiconductor Manufacturing International, one assembly subcontractor (Jiangsu Changjiang Electronics Technology), likely local DRAM (dynamic random-access memory) and Nand flash-memory production and one semi equipment company and a few fabless companies such as Spreadtrum Communications and HiSilicon,"" according to Morgan Stanley's report.Opportunities for non-Chinese firms include partnerships such as the one that Intel (INTC) has with Spreadtrum Communications and Rockchip Electronics, and Qualcomm 's (QCOM) joint venture with Semiconductor Manufacturing International.Morgan Stanley analysts also expect opportunities for chip technology licensing companies such as ARM Holdings (ARMH) to find new customers and for chip equipment makers to find new customers. More mergers and acquisitions related to the changing landscape are also likely, according to the report.Intel Price Target CutIn a separate report Monday, Pacific Crest Securities analyst Michael McConnell said after a trip to Asia that he is more positive on fundamentals at ARM, Avago Technologies (AVGO), Qorvo (QRVO) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS). Qorvo recently joined the S&P 500 index.McConnell said Nvidia (NVDA) is gaining broader design wins in China following strong orders from Baidu (BIDU), Huawei, Tencent (TCEHY) and Alibaba (BABA).He's ""incrementally more cautious"" on Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Cavium (CAVM), Intel, Xilinx (XLNX) and Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM).Pacific Crest lowered its price target on Intel stock to 35 from 37, based on the weak outlook for PC demand coupled with a delayed launch of Intel's Skylake processors.Intel stock was down 1.5% in afternoon trading in the stock market today, near 30.50.The analysts said new products at AMD are not driving design wins at PC customers, while feedback from Asia indicates that Marvell Technology Group's (MRVL) storage business is being affected by solid-state-drive share-loss and ""execution problems.""RELATED:Chip Leader Inphi Finds Support After Sell-Off.

1143,QCOM,"Ambarella Bolts Higher As Top Chip Stocks Lead Market.Qualcomm (QCOM) announced Thursday it would launch an accelerated share-repurchase program for $5 billion, a move one analyst said shows confidence in the company's ""ability to turn things around.""The San Diego-based chipmaker said in a press release it reached agreements with two financial institutions to repurchase $5 billion in stock, with an initial delivery of about 57.7 million shares. The repurchase is being funded through a recently completed $10 billion debt offering.In March, Qualcomm unveiled a new $15 billion buyback plan, noting at the time it intended to repurchase $10 billion of stock by March 2016.Qualcomm CEO Steve Mollenkopf said in the company's press release Thursday that the move enables it to ""continue to execute on our enhanced capital-return program.""Qualcomm said it plans to implement the remaining portion of its stock repurchase program through various means.Qualcomm stock was up 2% in midday trading in the stock market today, near 71. But Qualcomm stock is down 13% since touching a 15-year high of 81.97 on July 23.William Blair analyst Anil Doradla said in a research note Thursday that Qualcomm's decision to launch an accelerated share-repurchase program validates ""our positive thesis on the company as we continue to believe Qualcomm is one of the last large-cap semiconductor companies yet to benefit from investor-friendly capital-return initiatives.""Given that Qualcomm is now well positioned to exhaust $10 billion of its authorization by March 2016, we would not be surprised if the board of directors increased the company's authorization sometime next year.

1205,QCOM,"Technology companies have long been the innovation trendsetters, turning in strong earnings reports that most often put the industry at or near the top of the best-performing groups.That, however, is not expected to be the case with a second-quarter earnings season that begins in earnest Wednesday with chip leader Intel (INTC).The consensus estimate for the 66 tech companies in the S&P 500 is for earnings growth to average just 2% from the year-earlier quarter — despite an expected huge quarter of 39% EPS growth from the biggest company of them all, Apple (AAPL). The strong dollar is hitting U.S. techs, and the PC industry slowdown is also having an impact.The 2% rise puts tech in the middle of the pack among the 10 industry groups in the S&P 500. It's the weakest growth for tech in nine quarters, as reported by Thomson Reuters. The S&P 500 tech companies' earnings per share growth in Q1 averaged 9.7%.""Tech has slowed down and there are not a lot of strong trends driving industry growth,"" said Gregory Harrison, an earnings analyst at Thomson Reuters.The S&P 500 tech companies' EPS growth had averaged 13% in the previous four quarters, more than double that of the S&P 500 overall in that span.The overall estimate for the S&P 500 is for a 3% decline in EPS, but that's due to the ailing energy sector, which is expected to show a 61% drop. Take out the energy sector and EPS growth for the S&P hits 4.6%, more than double the tech average.'Low-Growth Environment'""We're stuck in a low-growth environment, with only modest improvement expected for the rest of the year,"" said Bill Whyman, research analyst at Evercore ISI. ""Tech investors are always looking for acceleration, but expectations for Q2 and the second half of this year have been coming down.""Besides concerns about the strong dollar, the global economic weakness highlighted by the stock crash in Asia and the near-bankruptcy for Greece are among the reasons that 24 of the 66 tech companies in the S&P 500 have lowered their Q2 guidance. Only seven have raised their views.The upcoming release of the Microsoft (MSFT) Windows 10 PC operating system and a new line of microprocessors coming from Intel are not expected to be strong growth drivers. Wearable devices such as smartwatches might be a long-term positive, but that field is just getting under way. The same is true with augmented reality devices.Meanwhile, the seismic industry shift to cloud computing continues to disrupt, says Whyman. That significant technological shift is shaking the rafters of the largest information technology companies, he says.The emergence of cloud computing has shattered old ways of using technology. Companies, rather than buying large volumes of computer servers and storage systems needed for business operations, are instead turning to cloud computing services from Amazon.com (AMZN), Google (GOOGL), Microsoft and IBM (IBM), among others.Moreover, many providers of cloud services are buying lower-cost hardware from Taiwan and China, opting for stripped down hardware of their own design instead of brand-name products.That's hit IBM, Hewlett-Packard (HPQ), Cisco Systems (CSCO), EMC (EMC) and other hardware vendors.Cloud computing has also spurred the growth in software-as-a-service business models. The SaaS model has enabled customers to pay only for what they use, instead of paying hefty fees for some services they don't need. Old-line software makers like Oracle (ORCL) and SAP (SAP) have struggled to shift more of their products to the cloud.This disruption is happening amid slower sales of PCs, smartphones and tablets.Research firm Gartner said PC shipments fell 9.5% in Q2 from Q2 2014, to 68.4 million units. Gartner also lowered its chip sales forecast for the year, now seeing a rise of just 2.2% this year, to $343 billion. It had been forecasting 4% growth.Apple Suppliers UpbeatThat's a problem for Intel, by far the largest maker of PC microprocessors. After the close Wednesday, Intel is expected to post a 7% drop in EPS to 51 cents a share. Revenue is expected to fall 5% to $13.1 billion. Year-over-year sales were flat in the previous quarter.Some Apple chip suppliers, though, have higher expectations. Avago Technologies (AVGO), which supplies chips for the iPhone and other smartphones, is expected to show EPS growth of 70%. Skyworks Solutions, another Apple supplier, is expected to post 54% EPS growth.Overall smartphone growth is slowing, but not at Apple, which is seeing strong growth in sales of its iPhone 6 and 6 Plus line rolled out last fall.Apple reports its June-quarter earnings after the close on July 21. Its expected 39% EPS rise would mark its sixth quarter in a row of double-digit percentage gains. Revenue is expected to climb 33.5% to $50 billion.The slowdown in smartphones, however, is hitting Google (GOOGL) Android phones, which account for the vast majority of overall smartphone sales. Cellphone chip supplier Qualcomm (QCOM) is expected to show a 34% drop in EPS. Its revenue is expected to fall 14% to $5.5 billion. Qualcomm reports after the close on July 22.The tech trends have been a big issue for IBM, which has sold hardware businesses and has posted 12 straight quarters of year-over-year declines in revenue. The 13th quarterly decline is likely ahead. IBM, which reports after the close on July 20, is expected to report a 14% revenue drop, to $20.9 billion.As the buying and selling of goods shifts online, along with advertising and other services, some companies benefit. Google, which reports after the close Thursday, is expected to show a 16% rise in EPS. Revenue is expected to rise 11% to $17.75 billion, its sixth quarter in a row of double-digit growth.Also reporting that day is eBay, which is expected to show a 4% rise in EPS and a 3% increase in revenue to $4.5 billion.Another beneficiary of the shift to Internet communications and advertising is social networking leader Facebook (FB), which reports after the close July 29. Facebook is expected to post 12% EPS growth and 37% growth in revenue, to $3.98 billion.

1208,QCOM,"A day after Reuters reported that chipmaker Atmel (ATML) has hired a firm to explore strategic alternatives including a possible sale, one analyst increased his price target on Atmel stock.FBR Capital Markets analyst Christopher Rolland, in a research report Tuesday, raised his price target on Atmel stock to 12 from 10, saying the company ""remains our top takeout candidate.""Rolland says suitors could include Qualcomm (QCOM), Avago Technologies (AVGO) and NXP Semiconductors (NXPI). He also puts Texas Instruments (TXN) and Microchip Technology (MCHP) in the mix.Reuters reported Monday that Atmel is working with investment bank Qatalyst Partners.Rolland said Atmel recently issued a change of control provision that increases compensation for executives in the event of an acquisition. He raised his odds of an Atmel buyout over the next 12 months to 40% from 25%.""We believe Atmel is 2.5 times more likely to be purchased than the average U.S. semiconductor company, primarily owing to the robust accretion opportunities presented to an acquirer,"" Rolland said. ""Stepping back, we think the Street underestimates the true earnings power of Atmel given the intermediate-term cyclical recovery in the core MCU (microcontroller) business, new opportunities for IoT (Internet of Things) products, differentiation through integrated maXTouch (touchscreen controllers) and MCU combo products and new engagements for crypto-memory products.""Atmel stock has been rising fast on the rumors, amid chip industry consolidation, and is up 35% just since early May. Atmel stock was up 2.5% in midday trading in the stock market today, at a more than three-year high, near 10.Cavium, Lattice Also Targets?Consolidation in the semiconductor industry is likely to continue this year, with Cavium (CAVM) and Lattice Semiconductor (LSCC) among other likely targets, Rolland says.Other acquisition candidates include Arm Holdings (ARMH), Applied Micro Circuits (AMCC) and Marvell Technology (MRVL).Chipmakers are looking for new sources of revenue growth, and strategic acquisitions can open up new opportunities.On June 1, Intel (INTC) announced that it agreed to buy Altera (ALTR) for about $16.7 billion in cash, marking the biggest acquisition in Intel's history. The transaction is expected to boost Intel's position in servers and other equipment found in corporate data centers, and position it to tap opportunities in the IoT, the company said.The previous week, Avago announced a $37 billion deal to acquire Broadcom (BRCM), which would make the largest chip acquisition ever.In March, NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) and Freescale Semiconductor (FSL) agreed to merge in a deal that values Freescale at $11.8 billion.Rolland also lists Fairchild Semiconductor (FCS), ON Semiconductor (ON) and Nvidia (NVDA) among chip companies with financial structures and valuations most favorable for mergers.In April, Applied Materials (AMAT) abandoned a $29 billion merger with Tokyo Electron because of antitrust concerns raised by the U.S. Department of Justice.RELATED:Apple Chip Supplier Among 4 Hot Stocks In Buy Zone.

1210,QCOM,"Demand for GoPro (GPRO) action cameras appears to be tracking ahead of guided expectations this quarter, and the company is building inventory for a big holiday shopping season, Pacific Crest Securities said Tuesday.Pacific Crest analyst Brad Erickson said his firm's August sales channel checks in the U.S. were positive for GoPro.""Sell-through checks are encouraging,"" Erickson said. ""The quarter is still tracking toward some upside.""GoPro also appears to be building its inventory for the all-important holiday season a bit earlier this year than last, he said.A product refresh is doubtful before the holidays, he said, noting that GoPro has come out with five new cameras since going public in June 2014. Those cameras include the tiny Hero 4 Session and the Hero+ LCD.Europe could provide some upside in Q4 because GoPro still has hundreds of incremental retail locations to add there, Erickson said. Plus, the European sales channel was starved a bit last year in Q4 because GoPro allocated initial Hero 4 camera shipments heavily to U.S. markets, he said.Erickson rates GoPro stock as sector weight based on valuation. But the recent stock market decline has made GoPro more attractive, he said. GoPro might need another catalyst such as its planned quadcopter drone product, due out in early 2016, Erickson said.Ambarella Riding Drone GrowthStrong demand for camera drones is one reason Erickson prefers Ambarella (AMBA) over GoPro. Ambarella makes image-processing chips for GoPro and others.He rates Ambarella stock as overweight with a price target of 123. Ambarella stock was down more than 1%, near 85, in afternoon trading on the stock market today. GoPro stock was down 5% to below 45.Sales channel checks reinforce confidence in Ambarella's fundamentals, Erickson said in a research report Tuesday.""Drone demand remains strong with most specialty stores in the U.S. having less than two weeks of inventory and some stores still struggling to secure steady supply,"" he said. Healthy GoPro sales also are encouraging for Ambarella, he said.Privately held companies like DJI, Parrot and 3D Robotics are among the biggest makers of consumer drones today, but their success has attracted public firms like GoPro and Sony (SNE), which are developing competing products.Qualcomm Making Integrated Drone ChipQualcomm's (QCOM) imminent entry into the drone market could have a ""modest impact"" on Ambarella, Erickson said. But only 10% of Ambarella's revenue comes from drones today. Ambarella gets about 7% of its revenue now from DJI camera drones, he said.While Ambarella specializes in video-processing chips, Qualcomm is looking to combine a video processor with the on-board flight controller to create an integrated system-on-a-chip for drones.""In high-end drones (where Ambarella typically plays), our checks indicate the most important attribute to the consumer is the video capture quality,"" Erickson said. ""Given Ambarella's chip pricing in the low $20 range, it seems a bit curious why a drone maker would look to carve out a few dollars of savings on the most important component when Qualcomm's solution also aims to replace the on-board flight controller, which can cost 10x the video processor and is the true 'brains' of the drone.""Qualcomm's chip could potentially cut hundreds of dollars from the drone build cost, but it would face power consumption and thermal issues that arise in recording 4K ultra high-definition video, Erickson said.RELATED:GoPro evolving into consumer lifestyle brandDrones Could Propel Ambarella, Others To New Heights .

1345,QCOM,"2 Top Chip Stocks That Funds Are Buying As M&A Heats Up.After months of speculation, No. 1 semiconductor company Intel (INTC) announced early Monday that it has agreed to pay $54 a share, or $16.7 billion, for programmable chipmaker Altera (ALTR).In a joint Intel-Altera merger announcement, Intel said it expects the deal to add to its earnings per share in the first year after the deal closes, and that the acquisition is expected to be completed in six to nine months, following approval from shareholders and regulators.The huge deal comes just days after Apple (AAPL) chip supplier Avago Technologies (AVGO) agreed to pay $37 billion in a cash-and-stock deal for another Apple chip supplier, Broadcom (BRCM).Intel said it intends to fund the Altera acquisition with a combination of cash from the balance sheet and debt. The boards of both Intel and Altera have approved the deal, which represents only a 10.5% premium over Altera's closing price Friday. But Altera had been trading roughly between 30 and 40 before the Intel rumors in late March sent Altera stock risingIntel has been looking to spur growth beyond the struggling personal computer market, which has been declining in recent years after peaking in 2011. Altera's chips are used in a variety of markets, including consumer electronics and communications.Altera will become an Intel business unit to facilitate continuity of existing and new customer sales and support. Intel will support products that have been developed by Altera running on the competing ARM Holdings (ARMH) central processing unit architecture, Intel said.Firms Expect IoT GrowthThe two companies said the merger ""enables new classes of products in high-growth data center and Internet of Things market segments.""Intel stock was down 1% in morning trading in the stock market today, near 34. Altera stock was up 6%, near 52.Intel said it plans to combine Altera's field-programmable gate array (FPGA) parts with its Xeon family of server chips for ""highly integrated"" new kinds of devices.The companies also expect to enhance Altera's products through design and manufacturing improvements resulting from Intel's integrated device manufacturing model.Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said in a statement that the acquisition will enable Intel to ""harness the power of Moore's Law to make the next generation of solutions not just better, but able to do more.""""Whether to enable new growth in the network, large cloud data centers or IoT segments, our customers expect better performance at lower costs. This is the promise of Moore's Law and it's the innovation enabled by Intel and Altera joining forces,"" he said.Altera CEO John Daane said in a statement that the company will be able to develop ""innovative FPGAs and system-on-chips for our customers in all market segments.""Intel remains firmly No. 1 in chip revenue. The Avago and Broadcom combination would be No. 3, also behind No. 2 chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM) and ahead of No. 4 Texas Instruments (TXN).Another Apple supplier, NXP Semiconductors (NXPI), agreed in March to buy Freescale Semiconductor (FSL) for $11.8 billion.RELATED:2 Top Chip Stocks That Funds Are Buying As M&A Heats Up.

1356,QCOM,"Stocks came out of the gate with a bang.....moving higher in the early seconds after the bell rang only to weaken as the mins ticked by......at 10:20 - the mkt was not only negative but was testing support .......and like I said in yesterday's note - it found the buyers......that's all it needed. The fact that the mkt failed to 'break' WAS the positive and it was off to the races...... By 3:30 - the indexes were once again flirting with their highs....and Nasdaq? Well that index was not only flirting, it was teasing traders and investors - daring them to push it up and thru its March 2000 high of 5048.....But alas - that was not to be yesterday.....and it may have a bit of trouble today as well....at least until investors have a chance to react to the disappointing tech numbers reported after the bell last night.

Sales rose by 42%....not bad, but the afterhours crowd was looking for 49%...so those bozo's were disappointed and took 2 1/2% out of the stock in the moments following the release....Now - revenue growth was impacted by the stronger dollar - and since FB generates more than 50% of its revenue overseas - then you can see the impact that the strong dollar had....BUT we KNEW THIS.....And since they don't 'produce' a product overseas - they did not get the benefit of weaker foreign currencies like so many of the multi-nationals are getting... In the end - earnings of 42 cts were ABOVE the 40 cts expectation and well above a year ago of 35 cts.... So - get over yourself....This was not a negative report....In early pre-mkt trading - the stock is holding right in line at $83.65 - which was yesterday's low...Now on Tuesday - the stock did gap up - just a bit - so technically - it might want to go back and 'fill that gap' at $83.15......and then after that...well - I suspect it could go on to challenge the March highs of $86/sh.

1374,QCOM,"Consumer electronics juggernaut Apple (AAPL) is fanning out into new markets, including its recently unveiled smart watch and a rumored car project, leaving its top suppliers to contemplate their next moves as well.Apple has been a mainstay on the IBD 50 list of top-rated stocks along with three of its key suppliers: radio-frequency chipmaker Avago Technologies (AVGO), smartphone and power management chipmaker Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), and touch-interface technology firm Synaptics (SYNA).Apple and it suppliers are expected to continue growing rapidly as Apple extends its footprint in smartphones, tablets and PCs, and climbs into new arenas.AppleThe company's flagship iPhone 6 smartphone line, which debuted last fall, is a hit for the Cupertino, Calif.-based company. Market research firm IDC on Tuesday forecast iPhone 6 and 6 Plus sales will rise 23% in 2015.But Apple isn't stopping there. In fact, it looks to gun its engines even harder with a possible push into cars. At the Code Conference this past week, Jeff Williams, the company's senior VP for operations, added to expectations of an Apple car by saying, ""The car is the ultimate mobile device.""The task of developing a car and making it fit the Apple aesthetic would fall largely to Jony Ive, who was named recently to the newly created position of chief design officer.""Jony is one of the most talented and accomplished designers of his generation, with an astonishing 5,000 design and utility patents to his name,"" CEO Tim Cook said in an employee memo.Apple shares closed down 1.1% at 130.28 on Friday. It climbed 143% from an April 30, 2013 low to an all-time high 133.60 on Feb. 24 of this year before consolidating.Avago TechnologiesIn a mega-merger that rides on a consolidation wave in the hot semiconductor industry, Singapore-based chipmaker Avago Technologies on Thursday announced it would buy communications and network chipmaker Broadcom (BRCM) for $37 billion.The combined Apple suppliers will have annual revenue of $15 billion, making it the world's No. 3 chipmaker by revenue behind Intel (INTC) and Qualcomm (QCOM).Avago, through the proposed acquisition, sees itself enhancing its lineup of FBAR (thin-film bulk acoustic resonator) wireless filters for mobile devices and radio-frequency front-end modules to better compete with companies such as Qorvo (QRVO) and Skyworks.Avago earned its best-possible 99 IBD Composite Rating with eight straight quarters of accelerating earnings per share growth. On Thursday, Avago put up a 151% increase in EPS as revenue soared 135%.Skyworks SolutionsThe maker of analog chips supplies both Apple and top Android phone maker Samsung. Skyworks unveiled a suite of analog control chips earlier this month that offer broad frequency ranges, high data rates and operate at elevated temperatures, making them suitable for use in Internet of Things applications such as smart lighting and the connected home.Skyworks rose above a two-month, 14% deep flat base with a 102.87 buy point earlier this month. It rose 1.6% Friday.SynapticsTop-performing computer and smartphone peripherals maker Synaptics also makes fingerprint and touchscreen technology found in Apple and Samsung smartphones and tablets.Synaptics is also poised to benefit from rising use of biometric ID systems, Cowen said in a report Tuesday as it reiterated an outperform rating and raised its price target to 115 from 105.Synaptics is the leading supplier of fingerprint sensors for Windows notebook PCs and plans to launch desktop products at Computex next week, Cowen said.Follow James DeTar on Twitter: @IBD_JDeTar.

1392,QCOM,"When Qualcomm set out to develop a more accurate sensor to authenticate fingerprints, the chipmaker chose ultrasound technology — the same high-frequency sound waves used by doctors to examine pregnancies.""It actually sees into the ridges of your fingerprint and pores of your skin,"" said Tim McDonough, Qualcomm's (QCOM) vice president of product marketing. ""That's the starting point. Then we encrypt the fingerprint and store it inside (Qualcomm's) Snapdragon processor. That's basically our brain inside the smartphone.""The Sense ID ultrasonic 3D fingerprint reading technology lets smartphones scan fingerprints through cover glass, sapphire or other material, giving smartphone designers more flexibility, he says.Qualcomm is among the tech companies developing biometric authentication technology aimed at doing away with passwords.""We all have too many passwords to deal with,"" said Mark Hocking, general manager of Intel (INTC)'s Safe Identity division, who says the effort to improve biometric authentication comes as no surprise given that personal identities are increasingly at risk.""Because this is such a big problem and because there are many different players and different approaches to solving the problem, there is a lot of experimenting and solution development going on. ..,"" Hocking said. ""We think we're unique in that we're trying to solve this problem holistically for consumers, which means across all their devices.""Windows 10 AuthenticationIntel's RealSense 3D camera, which uses infrared technology to enable biometric authentication, will be part of Microsoft 's (MSFT) new Windows 10 authentication feature, called Windows Hello.Intel Security also has unveiled its True Key password management application that can be installed on smartphones, tablets or computers. It uses biometrics factors such as fingerprints and facial recognition, using your ""facial math,"" Hocking said. The app also helps users choose stronger passwords with a password generator that uses military-grade encryption and multiple advanced-security technologies.Hocking said True Key's ""Face Unlock"" feature works by taking a template of your face and creating a mathematical representation of the key facial features, such as the distance between your eyes. The calculation, not a photo, is stored locally and encrypted on a person's device.The goal of getting rid of passwords has been talked about for years. Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates predicted it in February 2004, when speaking at an RSA Conference on security.Advances in biometrics technologies are bringing the concept of fewer or no passwords closer to reality, and opening up market opportunities. The worldwide market for fingerprint sensor-enabled devices alone is expected to reach 1.4 billion units by 2020, up from just 317 million units last year, says market research firm IHS.Ninth-Grader's ProjectCompanies are exploring better ways to authenticate fingerprints, faces and components of the human eye such as the retina and iris, as well as behavioral characteristics such as how a person types on a keypad, writes a particular phrase or signs their name.Budding scientist Nikhil Behari's ninth-grade science project, at North Allegheny Intermediate High School in Pennsylvania and featured at the White House in March, showed how connected sensors and a microprocessor could be combined to detect keystroke pressure and recognize a person's unique typing pattern, adding another level of security.Fujitsu's PalmSecure ID Match biometric authentication uses the unique pattern of veins in the human hand to verify identities.More companies are offering layers of security through hybrid biometrics, combining physical and behavioral characteristics such as voice recognition. Chipmakers are partnering with other companies to leverage expertise and differentiate their products.Cypress Semiconductor (CY) has combined its touch-sensing controllers, touchscreen and other sensor technologies with Norway-based Idex ASA's patented SmartFinger fingerprint-sensing technology to create the TrueTouch Fingerprint Reader.""Barriers to entry are considerable in the emerging market for fingerprint readers, in part because of the highly specialized intellectual property and complete solution that's required to compete,"" Cypress CEO T.J. Rodgers said in the company's press release last month on the partnership.NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) is partnering to bring its microcontroller, for ""always-on"" sensor processing applications running on a smartphone, with Next Biometrics' fingerprint sensor. NXP also is working to improve biometric authentication for smartcards.SmartMetric  has embedded a fully functional biometric fingerprint reader inside a credit card-sized identity card, using miniaturized radio frequency technology.Synaptics (SYNA) has developed its Natural ID fingerprint identification process using proprietary imaging technology and matching algorithms. The sensor requires a single touch rather than a swiping motion to unlock devices and access online services such as banking, retail and social media portals.Synaptics' Natural ID technology is in Samsung Galaxy S5 smartphones. Synaptics is looking at many other uses for biometrics, including applying eye-scanning technology and fingerprint-sensing in cars and in gaming.Synaptics, Cypress, Qualcomm, Microsoft, NXP, Google (GOOG) and PayPal are part of the Fast IDentity Alliance (FIDO), a consortium launched in 2012 to create interoperability among different platforms for hardware and software makers, financial firms and others.FIDO's first industry standards for online authentication are available and are being implemented in authentication products and services.Qualcomm Rolls Out ZerothFIDO member Nok Nok Lab's authentication technology is being used by fellow FIDO member MedImpact Healthcare Systems' physician access portal to enable doctors and other health care providers to log in with a fingerprint reader.Qualcomm is rolling out its Zeroth ""cognitive computing platform,"" a platform in development for years, McDonough says. Its technologies, including the new Snapdragon 820 chip, aim to set the stage for a new level of ""intelligence,"" personalization and security for mobile devices.Zeroth combines sensors, cameras, processors and other components to enable devices to analyze, learn and act on a person's behavior. Their technology also enables devices to recognize scenes, patterns and objects and read handwriting, among other things.Hocking said Intel is ""just getting started"" with technologies to give users better security while still providing easy access.""We view it as a multiyear journey that takes consumers from the point where they are today — which is overwhelmed with passwords — to eliminate that hassle,"" Hocking said. ""But that's going to take a long time because passwords are everywhere. This isn't a flip-a-switch type of problem.""

Nvidia stock has climbed 11% over the past 90 days.Intel (INTC) and Nvidia signed a six-year cross-licensing settlement in 2011 in which Intel agreed to pay Nvidia $1.5 billion in licensing fees.Covello says if the licensing agreement isn't renewed, Nvidia will see ""a step down in earnings per share (30% of earnings before interest and taxes), GPU (graphics processing unit) growth is likely to decelerate this year given near-term risks to personal computer original equipment manufacturer sales (20% of total) and gaming growth will likely normalize lower.""He expects Intel's final cash payment to be made in January 2016.""We believe the market has become complacent about the risk of Intel licensing revenue going away (with fewer sell-side analysts highlighting licensing in analyst day takeaways),"" Covello said. ""Our SanDisk (SNDK), Qualcomm (QCOM) and pharma case studies suggest stocks see 15% to 60% multiple compression going into binary events where licensing/patents are in jeopardy. We believe the near-term catalyst to refocus investor attention on longer-term normalized EPS will be weakness in PC fundamentals (which Nvidia noted it is not seeing at its analyst day).""Santa Clara, Calif.-based Nvidia supplies high-speed graphics cards for computer gaming, and it has diversified and grown its products to help build the car of the future and enable high-performance and cloud computing more broadly.Its sophisticated platform for computerizing cars got a lot of discussion at Nvidia's analyst day last Tuesday, and its GPU Technology Conference, where Elon Musk, CEO of partner Tesla Motors (TSLA), showed up.Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang introduced the Nvidia Drive PX, called a deep-learning platform for self-driving cars. It's based on two Nvidia Tegra X1 processors and uses input from 12 cameras. It's coming out as a developer kit in May 2015 for $10,000 to qualified buyers, the company says.Covello says the weakness of PCs could drive investors to re-evaluate Nvidia's progress in diversifying and focus on its core segments tied to PC OEMs, gaming and workstations.""While we believe the market it giving the company significant credit for its diversification progress, auto remains less than 5% of revenue, compared to the 55% of Nvidia's EBIT that is tied to the PC ecosystem (including PC OEMs),"" he said.RELATED: Chipmaker Nvidia Rolls Out Videogame Console.

1515,QCOM,"Synaptics, a force in fingerprint recognition and touchscreen technology, finished calendar 2014 with a bang, and its CEO tells IBD that the company is poised for continued robust growth amid rising global demand for smartphones and tablets.It's not without some cutting-edge competition, however.The San Jose, Calif.-based company earlier this year posted earnings of $1.46 per share for the quarter ended in December 2014, ex special items, a 70% jump from a year earlier. Sales surged 125% to $464 million. For its fiscal 2015 third quarter, ending in late March, Synaptics (SYNA) projects sales of $450 million to $490 million. At the midpoint of that forecast, sales would more than double from a year earlier.Synaptics President and CEO Richard Bergman said in an interview that the company has, over the past few years, deftly made the transition from a PC-focused firm to one with a broader approach that resulted in a dominant position devising ever-advancing technology for mobile devices. Its interface software is designed to bolster the user experience and security for smartphone and tablet owners.Smartphones ConnectAbout 86% of Synaptics' sales derived from mobile products in the December quarter, compared with 14% from PC products, including notebook computers. Three years ago, Bergman says, PC sales accounted for about 50% of revenue. He says sales linked to PC products have only inched down in that time, meaning Synaptics has maintained share in that arena while producing whopping growth in the mobile field to shift its revenue mix to capitalize on high demand.""I'm proud of how we've been able to cross that bridge,"" he said.Synaptics should keep enjoying ""the leading position across high-end smartphones, particularly with content on three leading OEMs (Apple (AAPL), Samsung, Xiaomi),"" Cowen & Co. analyst Robert Stone said in a research note on March 2.Samsung unveiled its high-end Galaxy S6 smartphone at the start of the month. It goes on sale April 10.""Improved Galaxy S6 designs, area fingerprint sensors and Samsung Pay should drive unit growth"" for Synaptics, Stone wrote, adding that he thinks some touch technology in that phone, a touch controller, is by STMicroelectronics (STM).Synaptics' blue-chip customers, he notes, include nine of the top 10 notebook original equipment manufacturers — all but Apple — and that Synaptics' designs are in phones or tablets by the likes of Apple, Samsung, Xiaomi, LG, Sharp and others.Synaptics is part of the Computer-Hardware-Peripherals industry group and has a Composite Rating of 95 from IBD, making it a group leader along with Apple, Zebra Technologies (ZBRA) and Super Micro Computer (SMCI). It's seventh-largest in the group by market value, after Apple, Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ), Canon (CAJ), Fujifilm Holdings (FUJIY), Xerox (XRX) and Zebra.Synaptics carved out a dominant position in fingerprint recognition with its so-called ""swipe"" sensor, embedded in smartphones — including high-end offerings from Samsung — and other devices. This technology works as the name implies: a user swipes a finger or thumb across the sensor and it reads the fingerprint, serving as a higher level of security than typing in a password. Fingerprint Log-Ins EvolveBergman says Synaptics will continue to develop advancing versions of the swipe sensor while it simultaneously rolls out new developments in ""area"" technology, expected to be a key driver of growth in the year ahead and beyond. With an area sensor, users merely touch a finger in a designated area on the device — a simpler process than swiping and one that affords faster reading of the fingerprint to unlock phones, tablets and computers.Synaptics already is mass-producing area sensors, Bergman says, and the company anticipates they will be increasingly adopted by numerous mobile producers over the course of calendar 2015.""We expect several announcements as we go through the year,"" he said.In his March 2 research note, analyst Stone mentioned Synaptics' announcement ""that the small area 4 x 10mm fingerprint sensor is now in mass production"" while describing the Samsung Galaxy S6.""We estimate that the dollar content per phone (for Synaptics) should be slightly higher compared to the GS5, as the area fingerprint sensor should be worth more than the combination of touchscreen controller and swipe sensor on the GS5,"" Stone wrote.The new fingerprint readers, analysts say, could boost growth in mobile as well as in the PC business. Such advances are in high demand as consumers in the U.S., Europe and Asia increasingly access online services such as retail, banking and social media portals, amplifying the appeal of easy-to-manage security measures and providing Synaptics with a long-term growth driver.Market research firm IHS recently predicted that the global volume of fingerprint sensor-enabled devices would balloon from 317 million units at the end of 2014 to 1.4 billion units by 2020.Synaptics is ""always focused on product improvement and solid execution,"" Liwen Zhang, an analyst at Blaylock Beal Van, told IBD. ""I think they will continue to do well, continue to deliver.""Fingerprint recognition is one of ""two pillars of growth going forward"" for Synaptics, Bergman said. The other is touch display driver integration, or TDDI, which combines into a single chip both touch control and the technology used to display the screen on computers and mobile devices.This simplifies design, resulting in thinner touchscreens and brighter displays. It also reduces the number of components needed in the manufacturing process, trimming costs and providing Synaptics' customers added incentive to invest in the chips. Synaptics estimates that more than half of all smartphones will have a display-integrated touchscreen by the end of this year.TDDI Chips Fire UpIn a billion-unit-per-year business, Stifel Nicolaus analyst Kevin Cassidy said, Synaptics' forecast means the TDDI chips could soon be in some 500,000 smartphones, adding ""that's a pretty big market.""The TDDI advance grew out of Synaptics' 2014 acquisition of Renesas SP Drivers, or RSP, a supplier of display drivers for smartphones and tablets. Synaptics combined RSP's display expertise with its own, aiming to lift the caliber of TDDI and accelerate its adoption.Bergman said that near-term, Synaptics is squarely focused on its efforts in fingerprint recognition and TDDI and doesn't have more acquisitions on its front burner.Deals could help the company drive future growth, he said, adding, ""we will continue to look.""The December-quarter results were the first to include the acquisition of RSP, which contributed about half of Synaptics' sales. Without RSP, sales would have grown about 10% vs. a year earlier.The vast majority of what Synaptics produces gets sold into Asia, where PC and mobile devices are typically manufactured. Though he did not have a geographic breakdown, Bergman said the end products that contain Synaptics' technology are sold all over the world, from the U.S. to Europe to China.The latter is where Synaptics is now seeing tremendous growth. It expects that to continue, Bergman said, not only due to China's massive population but also because the average resident there is gaining spending power, fueling demand for new tech-driven products.""We have a big emphasis on China,"" he said.Qualcomm ChallengesAnalysts note that competition in the tech world, particularly when it comes to those working on mobile devices, is fierce and presents a prominent possible downside for Synaptics. Just this month, chipmaking giant Qualcomm (QCOM) announced new technology that uses ultrasonic sound waves to read fingerprints, even more seamlessly than what is already being rolled out by Synaptics and Apple's own in-house efforts for its iPhones. Qualcomm has said its Snapdragon Sense ID 3D Fingerprint Technology can read fingerprints when a finger is wet or dirty, for instance. Analysts covering Synaptics point to the company's long history of innovation and of staving off competitive pressures.It has operated in the touchpad space for 15 years and has long maintained a roughly two-thirds market share in the segment, Cassidy said. The company, he added, gets ahead of competition and stays there by constantly developing new technology while finding ways to do so at reasonable costs. Its acquisition of RSP, he said, gives it significant added scale that should enable it to continue to produce on these fronts. On Qualcomm specifically, Cassidy said it remains to be seen how well the new offering will be received by consumers and, perhaps more important, whether the technology can be brought to market at a favorable price. He said Qualcomm's decision to go with the technology ""adds a lot of credibility to it,"" but pricing of smartphone components is ""very sensitive,"" as makers of the phones are in heated competition to deliver innovation at attractive rates.""I don't think anyone new to the (fingerprint recognition) market is going to make a shift in who controls volume for at least another year,"" he added.Longer term, Cassidy said, he expects Synaptics to become a force in developing technology for touchscreens in cars and, eventually, in other areas of consumers' daily lives, from appliances to products that have yet to be invented.""I think they are going to be the survivor throughout all of this,"" Cassidy said of Synaptics. ""They've proven that they always find a way.""Synaptics' stock is up 17% so far this year.

Qualcomm also could be required to lower its royalty rates by a third on patents used in China, the report says.""We believe this potential outcome is better than investors feared and would be consistent with our modeling assumptions used for our fiscal 2016 pro-forma EPS estimates, as we have already assumed royalty rates on 5-mode Chinese LTE phones decline from 4.5% to roughly 3.25%,"" Canaccord Genuity analyst Michael Walkley said in a research report Monday.Walkley, who reiterated a buy rating and 84 price target on Qualcomm stock, said that ""with Qualcomm trading in the premarket at roughly 12 times our fiscal 2016 pro forma EPS estimate, we believe the valuation is compelling for longer-term investors.""Qualcomm stock was up more than 2% in midday trading in the stock market today, near 68.San Diego-based Qualcomm is a leading provider of chips used in smartphones, with customers including Apple (AAPL) and many providers of smartphones that run on the Google (GOOG) Android operating system.Qualcomm, which provides an LTE modem and RF transceiver for Apple's iPhones, according to analysts and a teardown by iFixit, benefited as Apple reported it sold 74.5 million iPhones in the quarter ended Dec. 30.Qualcomm in late January cut its fiscal 2015 outlook, citing the loss of sales to an unnamed major customer, likely Samsung, and competition in China.Reuters says discussions in Beijing over one of the most contentious cases under China's 2008 anti-monopoly law have intensified in recent weeks, culminating in meetings Friday between Qualcomm senior executives and NDRC officials.In a conference call with analysts on Jan. 28, Qualcomm President Derek Aberle said the company continued to ""engage and fully cooperate"" with Chinese anti-monopoly authorities.""We have discussed with the NDRC a number of proposals for addressing the concerns,"" Aberle said, noting that ""the timing and outcome of any potential resolution remains uncertain, as does the potential impact on our future business in China.""Aberle says uncertainties associated with the investigation have hampered its ability to strike licensing deals in China, where it has also faced disputes with some customers.RELATED:Big Tech Firms Divided In IoT Standards Battle.

1590,QCOM,"Some prognosticators play it safe with year-ahead predictions. They'll build their forecasts off known events like product launches (Apple Watch, Windows 10, etc.) or extrapolate from current trends (cloud computing, Internet of Things, etc.).But others are much more daring. Like Babe Ruth confidently pointing to the center-field bleachers and swinging for a home run, these forecasters are willing to take a gamble and risk striking out big time.What follows are 10 of the boldest predictions for the tech industry in 2015.1. Twitter gets sold, possibly to GoogleShort-message social network Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) had a rough time in 2014. The microblogging service went public on Nov. 7, 2013, at 26 and ended that year at 63.65. Twitter stock fell 44% in 2014, closing Wednesday at 35.87. The San Francisco-based firm has struggled to grow its active user base and advertising revenue. Some on Wall Street have called for CEO Dick Costolo's head.Chris Ciaccia, technology editor of TheStreet, says Twitter will get bought out in 2015.""Don't be shocked to see Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) come knocking if Twitter's market cap drops below $20 billion,"" he wrote. It ended 2014 with a market cap of $22.4 billion.2. A major Web player buys NetflixCCS Insight, a U.K.-based technology research firm, thinks subscription streaming video firm Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) will be acquired by a major Web company in 2015.""All Web players are looking for a stronger presence in paid-for video, something Netflix has achieved with remarkable success . .. Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO), Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) and Google are potential suitors,"" CCS said in a report. If Google doesn't buy Netflix, it will launch its own video streaming service in 2015, CCS predicted.On a similar note, Strategy Analytics analyst Michael Goodman predicted Google and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) each will launch subscription video-on-demand services in the new year. He suggested that either of those two could step up and buy Hulu to accelerate their efforts.3. Google buys PayPalEBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) is scheduled to spin off its PayPal unit in 2015. But Bob Pisani, CNBC ""On-Air Stocks"" editor, doesn't think that will happen. Instead, Google will buy PayPal and combine it with Google Wallet to take on Apple Pay in the emerging mobile payments market, he said.Cash-rich search giant Google is a common theme in big acquisition predictions.CCS even predicts that Google will buy action-camera maker GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO) in 2015.4. Qualcomm acquires AMD for its IPWireless chip firm Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) might buy struggling PC and graphics chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) just to get its intellectual property to fend off Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), tech journalist Andy Patrizio said in Network World.CCS predicts Qualcomm will gobble up activity-band maker Fitbit in 2015.5. Red Hat buys ClouderaLarry Dignan, editor-in-chief of ZDNet, predicted that Red Hat (NYSE:RHT) will buy IPO candidate Cloudera in 2015.""Red Hat buys Cloudera in a move that solidifies its position in analytics,"" he said. ""Culturally, the two open-source companies could mesh well. From an art of war perspective, Red Hat's acquisition plays keep away from Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), IBM (NYSE:IBM) and a long list of other interested parties.""Dignan also predicted that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) will spin off its Amazon Web Services cloud computing business and that data-storage firm EMC (NYSE:EMC) will merge with Hewlett-Packard's (NYSE:HPQ) enterprise business.6. At least one major 3D printer maker gets acquiredBrian Krassenstein, co-founder and editor-in-chief at 3DPrint.com, predicted that one or more of the following publicly traded 3D printer companies will be acquired by a larger corporation before the end of 2015: 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD), Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS), ExOne (NASDAQ:XONE), Voxeljet (NYSE:VJET) or Organovo (AMEX:ONVO).7. Cisco's John Chambers steps downJohn Chambers has been CEO at Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) since January 1995, when he was 46 years old. Now 65, and after 20 years at the helm of the networking company, it might be time for Chambers to retire. Of course, that's been rumored for years, as Fortune noted in September.""I thought last year would be the year that Cisco CEO John Chambers stepped down, paving the way for his replacement,"" TheStreet's Ciaccia said. ""As it turns out, I was wrong, but that's not going to stop me from making another prediction for this year.""8. VMware acquires ServiceNowEMC finally will spin off VMware (NYSE:VMW) in 2015, Elias Khnaser, chief technology officer at Sigma Solutions, predicted. VMware will then go on a buying spree, most notably picking up ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW), he said.""One of the most important goals of this spree will be to beef up vCloud Air and fend off both Microsoft and Amazon, which won't be easy to do,"" Khnaser said. ""I predict that in order for VMware to capture and enhance its private and hybrid cloud, it will acquire ServiceNow. Service management is a key component of any private cloud, and with ServiceNow's dominant market share, extensive platform and the potential to capture significant services engagement and enhance its own tools, it's the perfect acquisition target to cement VMware's place in the hybrid cloud game.""9. We'll witness the rise of ElloSick of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) for its advertising and spotty privacy record, many social networking users will switch to upstart Ello, predicted Jayson DeMers, founder of AudienceBloom.""The platform, which is still in public beta (meaning invite-only), has caused quite a stir,"" DeMers said. ""Dubbed by some as the 'hipster social network,' Ello offers a forever ad-free experience and promises to never sell its users' information to third parties.""Ello will grow in both user numbers and engagement in 2015, he said.10. Zynga brand disappearsEach year, 24/7 Wall St. identifies 10 American brands that it predicts will disappear before the end of the next year. Some may be acquired, while others go out of business.This year, among tech companies not in the process of merging, 24/7 Wall St. selected social games company Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA) and online photo website Shutterfly (NASDAQ:SFLY) for its brand hit list.RELATED:What Are The Top Cybersecurity Threats Of 2015?Will New Google Android Live TV Outfox Apple?Why 2015 May Be A Pivotal Year For Drone Development.

1605,QCOM,"Wireless charging of mobile devices has been slow to take off, but Apple's (AAPL) upcoming smartwatch could change that.Market research firm IHS (IHS) says global sales of wireless power receivers and transmitters in wearable applications will surge to $481 million in 2015, up from $14.5 million last year. The release this spring of the Apple Watch will spur the market, IHS predicted in a recent report.The market for wireless power and charging in wearables could approach $1.2 billion in 2019, IHS said.""Growth this year will be remarkable for wireless charging in wearable electronic devices, even if in reality the overall penetration of wireless charging into wearables is relatively low given the billions of wearables that are shipped into the consumer market every year,"" IHS analyst Vicky Yussuff said in a statement. ""Still, interest in the use of wireless charging remains high on the part of wearable technology providers and device original equipment manufacturers. As a result, penetration is expected to escalate rapidly over the next five years.""The Apple Watch could account for more than 70% of revenue this year from wireless charging-enabled wearable devices, IHS said.Apple's smartwatch will use the company's proprietary MagSafe inductive charging technology. With this system, the smartwatch is tethered to the charger and held in place by a magnet.Other wireless charging technologies today typically consist of a pad or mat on which consumers place an enabled device for charging. This method is often called ""drop and charge.""But new technologies will give users greater freedom on where they can charge their devices. These include wireless charging through surfaces like a desk and wireless charging over distances.By the end of 2017, shipments of wearable-technology wireless charging receivers that allow charging over distances will overtake inductive or tightly coupled solutions, IHS predicts.The wireless charging market is in its infancy, Yussuff told IBD. Companies angling for a share of the market include wireless technology licensors and semiconductor and component suppliers for wireless power transmitters/receivers, she said.Licensors in the market include WiTricity, Powermat Technologies, ConvenientPower, PowerbyProxi and Energous (WATT).Chip and component suppliers include Freescale Semiconductor (FSL), Integrated Device Technology (IDTI), Mediatek, Texas Instruments (TXN), Qualcomm (QCOM), Broadcom (BRCM) and TDK.Wireless charging also is starting to take off in the mobile phone market.Samsung's next-generation flagship smartphone, the Galaxy S6, might debut with built-in wireless charging when it is announced in March, Dougherty analyst Charles Anderson said in a report Wednesday. If this happens, IDT has good odds of being the supplier, he said. Also in the running are TI, Broadcom and On Semiconductor (ONNN).""The highest-profile smartphone to date using wireless charging has been the LG G3, which split the socket between IDTI and TI based on geography,"" Anderson said. ""Our sense is that Broadcom's focus is wearables as opposed to smartphones at the moment. On Semi's competitive position is mostly unknown at this point other than the reference design with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 SoC.""The Samsung Galaxy S6 wireless charging business could be worth $112.5 million to $135 million annually, assuming Samsung sells at least 45 million of the handsets in 2015, he said. Anderson estimates wireless charging chip revenue per phone would be $2.50 to $3 ($1 for the receiver and $1.50 to $2 for the transmitter).RELATED:Apple Watch has no peer at CES 2015, analyst says.

""With China's chip industry producing $42 billion, there is a long catch-up that Beijing would like to see happen.""Intel's joint ventures are ""strategic investments designed to get them into tablets and smartphones,"" said ABR Investment Strategy analyst JoAnne Feeney.Hedging Its BetsUBS Investment Research analyst Stephen Chin sees Intel's Chinese partnerships as part of a broader strategy to defend its core PC business while also ""hedging for the possibility of tablets becoming the main computing device in emerging market countries or where cost sensitivity is high.""Demand for smartphones has cooled in the U.S., so manufacturers have increased their focus on China, where demand is robust for handsets priced under $150.Nearly 500 million smartphones will be sold next year in China, market research firm IDC forecasts in a report released this month. That's roughly one-third of global sales and triple the U.S. forecast.Despite slowing economic growth, China's impact on information and communication technology markets will jump next year, accounting for 43% of all spending growth in those sectors, IDC says.Intel is looking to Chinese partners who will use its technology to make chips for low-cost smartphones and tablets instead of licensing chip designs from rival ARM Holdings (ARMH) .Intel — the No. 1 overall chipmaker, thanks to its stranglehold on computer chips — has increasingly targeted the tablet and smartphone market after a late start in the mobile market. The company is on track to have its chips inside 40 million tablets by the end of 2014, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said in a conference call in September.China also is crucial for Qualcomm. Last year, Qualcomm got nearly a third of its profit from patent licensing, about half of it from China.In July, Qualcomm said that it would invest up to $150 million in Chinese startups focused on everything from semiconductors and e-commerce to Internet and mobile health care. Its Chinese investments include Enorbus, Aicent, NetQin (NQ), Xiaomi, Thundersoft, MadHouse, CooTek, Yongche, Dolphin Browser and Hawkeye, Sundararjan said.Spreadtrum Boosts SoCsIntel, which has a chip fabrication facility in Dalian, China, and a chip-assembly plant in Chengdu, is working with Spreadtrum on system-on-chips. SoCs are key components in mobile devices and combine features such as processors, Wi-Fi and memory. Rockchip brings expertise in connectivity and graphics to its partnership for Intel-branded tablet SoCs.Spreadtrum helps Intel elsewhere. Spreadtrum more than doubled its shipments of baseband chips that connect mobile phones to networks in 2013, says Sundararajan, and now has a 5% share by revenue.Intel is spending $4 billion this year and $3.2 billion next year to get its chips designed into tablets. It's focused on gaining support from Chinese ""white box vendors"" (PC retailers), the analyst said.""Intel Capital (Intel's investment unit) has dished out some $28 million in 2014 to several Chinese companies specializing in wearable devices, smartphones and the Internet of Things (IoT) technology as part of its China Smart Device Innovation Fund,"" Sundararajan said.Among companies that have received funds from Intel Capital are IoT firm Shenzhen Fibocom Industrial Development and Guangdong Appscomm Digital Technology, which specializes in smart wearable devices.Resolving the dispute in China is a top priority, as is expanding business in that market, Qualcomm CEO Steve Mollenkopf said in a conference call in November.China's anti-monopoly probe focuses on how Qualcomm collects royalties and its policy of selling its chipsets only to customers who pay the patent fees, the firm says.JMP Securities analyst Alex Gauna attended Qualcomm's analyst day event on Nov. 19. He says that Qualcomm didn't shed any light on solving those licensing issues nor on investigations into its business practices by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and the European Commission.""There was a lot of confidence in terms of outlining road maps for maintaining LTE technology leadership, pushing into total addressable, market-expanding adjacencies such as the data center and IoT applications, and maintaining operating expenditure discipline,"" Gauna said.Qualcomm's partnerships with smaller Chinese product makers could help it settle the dispute over mobile device makers in China that refuse to pay royalties, analysts say.Qualcomm said that it remains focused on capturing long-term growth drivers such as smartphone sales in China.Through early November, Qualcomm had signed more than 75 single-mode LTE licenses with Chinese original equipment manufacturers, said Qualcomm President Derek Aberle in the November call.Qualcomm remains in discussions with many OEMs that have not paid royalties. Negotiations have been delayed, at least in part, by the pending (China) National Development and Reform Commission investigation, Aberle said.""The timing and outcome of any resolution remains uncertain, as does the potential impact of our future business in China,"" Aberle said. ""We continue to believe that some of our licensees are not reporting all of their shipments. ""We are engaged in conducting audits of these licensees and attempting to identify and resolve instances of underreporting.""RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Sue expects a resolution to take six months to a year.""Qualcomm's stock may remain in a holding pattern near term until the China investigation and licensing nonpayment/underpayment disputes are sorted out,"" Sue said.

That would be the third straight quarter of single-digit growth compared with the previous 14 straight quarters of double-digit growth.The consensus on earnings per share minus items is $1.31, up 25%, a slowdown from the 40% growth in the previous quarter.Qualcomm (QCOM) was down 1.4% in afternoon trading in the stock market today, near 77. The stock is down about 6% from the 14-year high it hit just prior to its last quarterly earnings report in late July.Revenue growth at Qualcomm has been pressured by a maturing high-end smartphone market and increasing demand for lower-cost phones in price-sensitive markets such as China. The lower the average selling price of phones, the less profit for Qualcomm from its chip sales and technology licenses.Qualcomm is also involved in a royalty payment dispute with Chinese smartphone makers that likely will be an overhang on the wireless chip designer's stock for several quarters.When Qualcomm last reported quarterly earnings on July 23, it guided revenue and EPS lower due to lowered estimates on royalties it expects to collect from China.

1703,QCOM,"Cowen and Co. boosted its target price for Broadcom (BRCM) on Thursday as the fabless chipmaker exits the cellular baseband business as part of a ""broad corporate transformation"" expected to drive earnings power and increase margins.

"
1706,QCOM,"Cowen analyst Timothy Arcuri said in a research report that although Broadcom is still in the ""very early innings of a broad corporate transformation, we see a transformation from growth at all costs to profitable growth.""
"
1707,QCOM,"The transformation is expected to result in several fundamental changes, including focusing the company on high-margin business segments with growth prospects still more than two times the overall semiconductor sector, Arcuri said.
"
1708,QCOM,"Cowen continues to see significant upside as Broadcom focuses more on defensible and profitable markets that still have a lot of growth, he said.
"
1709,QCOM,"Broadcom has three major segments: mobile and wireless, infrastructure and networking, and broadband communications. The company reported that its mobile and wireless segment accounts for about 50% of revenue, while the other two divisions each account for about 25% of revenue. Broadcom has grown its networking business at a double-digit growth rate over the past two years.
"
1710,QCOM,"Possibilities for additional restructuring at Broadcom include the potential sale of its mobile connectivity assets (net of some potential IP cross-licenses for broadband access points and set-top boxes) to a potential buyer such as Intel (INTC), MediaTek, Microchip Technology (MCHP), Qualcomm (QCOM) or others, Arcuri said.
"
1711,QCOM,"""Broadcom is the next semiconductor company to have 'found religion' around costs and shareholder return, following the playbook of several others like Texas Instruments (TXN),"" Arcuri said. ""From here, we expect Broadcom to become a much better steward of shareholder value including, but not limited to, repatriation of offshore cash and meaningful expansion of its capital return program, further divestiture of assets (possibly connectivity) and focused investment on verticals where it has meaningful competitive advantage.""

1715,QCOM,"It's sad, but true. Good things don't last forever.In the market, stocks can have monster runs that go on for months or more. But when these massive rallies come to an end, they typically do so in dramatic fashion.Just look at past winners Crocs (CROX) and MasterCard (MA). After skyrocketing 431% in 59 weeks, shares of the shoemaker plunged 99%. MasterCard dived 65% after charging up 565% in 95 weeks.If you caught a major winner through hard work or was just lucky, the worst thing that you can do is to give back those gains. So when things start to get crazy, you don't have to sell right away. But you should start to get cautious and start watching out for signs of climactic activity.Not all stocks top this way. But when they do, investors should be prepared.Climax tops sometimes occur after a stock has been rallying for many months, usually at least 18 weeks after breaking out from a sound base. After such a long advance, take notice if gains suddenly accelerate. A climax top may be on the horizon.One sign of climax action may not be enough to end a stock's run, but watch out when several signs start to appear.•Exhaustion gaps. After a long run, a stock opens above the prior day's high. Such exhaustion gaps are usually a sign of strength and they are welcomed at the start of a breakout, but not at the latter stages of the game. There may be a series of these before a stock finally caves in.•Largest daily point increase. After an extended run, a stock that stages its biggest one-day point gain since the beginning of the move may be close to peaking.•Heaviest-volume day. A stock's top can occur on the day that it trades the most shares since the start of the run.•Consecutive up days. A stock goes straight up for seven or eight sessions in a row, following a long run-up. Or one that rallies for eight out of 10 days.•Largest weekly price spread. The difference between the week's high and low price is the biggest since the start of the move.•Price pierces an upper channel line. A stock that breaks above its upper channel line after a run-up. The channel line should connect at least three highs over the past four or five months.•Distance above 200-day moving average. The stock is extended when the price gets to be 70% to 100% or more stretched above its 200-day moving average. Few stocks can maintain that kind of momentum.In the late 1990s Qualcomm (QCOM) nearly quadrupled after coming out of a rare ascending base in October 1999. From Dec. 13 to Dec. 21, the stock rallied for seven straight sessions (1). On Dec. 29, the stock had its biggest one-day point gain since its initial breakout back in January 1999 (2). At the high of that day, the stock soared 251% above its 200-day moving average.In the week ended Dec. 31, the stock had its largest weekly price spread (see weekly chart).Qualcomm also suffered from excessive stock splits. The company had a 2-for-1 split in May of 1999 and then had a 4-for-1 split just over seven months later. The stock topped Jan. 3, 2000, and was nearly cut in half by Jan. 28 (3).

1739,QCOM,"In a letter, 60 technology companies on Wednesday again urged the Federal Communications Commission not to impose public utility-type regulation on high-speed Internet services, amid growing signs that FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler will go along with President Obama's call for Title II reclassification.

1740,QCOM,"Intel (INTC), Cisco Systems (CSCO), IBM (IBM) and Qualcomm (QCOM) are among the 60 companies. The same group sent a similar letter to the FCC in September.
"
1741,QCOM,"Obama in November pressured the FCC to reclassify Internet services — including mobile broadband — as a public utility under Title II telecommunications regulations, a move opposed by broadband providers such as Comcast (CMCSA) and Verizon Communications (VZ).
"
1742,QCOM,"The FCC is revising its net neutrality, also called Open Internet, rules after a Washington, D.C., Court of Appeals ruling in January gutted much of the FCC's authority. If Wheeler goes along with Obama's Title II plan, Verizon has signaled it would again file suit challenging the agency's authority.
"
1743,QCOM,"Paul Gallant, an analyst at Guggenheim Partners, says the FCC is likely to take a Title II ""light"" approach, meaning it will not exercise all utilitylike regulations, such as oversight of pricing for broadband services. It's also unlikely the FCC will seek to let state public utility commissions regulate broadband services.
"
1744,QCOM,"""We believe the FCC's most likely decision is to reclassify broadband as a Title II service,"" said Gallant in a research report. ""The most significant factor in our thinking continues to be President Obama's unambiguous call for Title II-based net neutrality rules with forbearance from price regulation.
"
1745,QCOM,"""We're not sure that Chairman Wheeler has made a final decision, but our sense from many in Washington is that the president's statement clearly shifted the center of gravity away toward Title II.

"
1746,QCOM,"The D.C. court's decision in January appeared to leave the FCC with a sliver of authority to regulate broadband Internet under section 706. Net neutrality rules have barred ISPs from blocking, or ""unreasonably"" discriminating against, any Internet traffic.

1750,QCOM,"Institutional money managers who have a mandate to find good dividend-paying stocks don't perform their job much differently from their zero-income, high-growth-focused counterparts.
"
1751,QCOM,"Those in the first camp tend to invest heavily as the broad economy grows. They like to see stable, low inflation. Some don't worry much about a gradual rise in interest rates.
"
1752,QCOM,"But top income managers also pay close attention to a company's ability to generate strong cash flow, keep their balance sheets healthy and follow through on pledges to boost cash dividends.
"
1753,QCOM,"Today, these managers also continue to see a positive environment for this area of the stock market. Why? American firms' fundamentals keep getting stronger.
"
1754,QCOM,"""Over the past few years, companies have cut costs, strengthened their balance sheets, and hence, have considerably better cash flows and operating margins to dedicate toward shareholder-friendly moves, including higher dividends,"" Linda Bakhshian, portfolio manager of $1.2 billion Federated Capital Income Fund , told IBD.
"
1755,QCOM,"""In fact, investors are demanding that management return more in dividend income now.""
"

"
1757,QCOM,"Clamoring For Cash
"
1758,QCOM,"Bakhshian offers another reason why income stocks continue to do well. The mindset of the 2010s is very different from the 1980s and 1990s. Back then, market players generally frowned upon managements who returned cash to shareholders instead of reinvesting in the business.
"
1759,QCOM,"""That stigma no longer holds,"" she said. ""Investors are more vigilant and more vocal about what they would like to see from management, and returning cash to shareholders is a key priority. Just look at how much more shareholder activism there is in the marketplace.""
"
1760,QCOM,"Today, Bakhshian sees potential increases in cash payouts among technology firms. Indeed, a few of the biggest stars in the sector — from Apple (AAPL) (95 Composite Rating, current annual yield of 1.8%) to Microsoft (MSFT) (66 Composite, 2.8% yield) to Qualcomm (QCOM) (84 Composite, 2.3%) — dish out billions of dollars in dividends each year.
"
1761,QCOM,"As of May 31, information technology made up 9.5% of the fund's equities component. Energy was the top sector component, making up 20.7%, followed by financials at 11.8%, industrials 11.1% and utilities and consumer staples at 8.2% each.
"
1762,QCOM,"Other top-performing managers look for stocks that show less propensity for big swings in fundamentals and a greater tendency for highly reliable numbers in terms of profits, sales and margins.
"
1763,QCOM,"""You are looking for a stable, lower volatility investment, from a well capitalized company, that is increasing dividends and paying out a higher yield,"" Bryan Sadoff of Milwaukee-based family-run investment advisory Sadoff Investments, which has $850 million under management, told IBD.

1764,QCOM,"So, what issues remain on fund managers' minds before they go to bed each night?

"
1766,QCOM,"""We are concerned that a slower European economy and a weaker euro may impact the overall pace of S&P 500 company earnings into the fourth quarter of this year and 2015 and erode CEO confidence,"" Bakhshian said.

1769,QCOM,"Sadoff is more concerned about three other potential developments that could damage the economy and thus dim or even destroy the prospects of dividends paid by companies: 1.) Retail sales go negative. 2.) Consumer prices ""begin to falter, which would tell us that underlying demand is falling,"" Sadoff said. 3.) The jobs market sees losses, not gains.

Within equities, cyclical sectors tend to outperform defensive, or in other words high dividend growers will likely outperform high dividend payers,"" Bakhshian said.Institutional money managers who have a mandate to find good dividend-paying stocks don't perform their job much differently from their zero-income, high-growth-focused counterparts.Those in the first camp tend to invest heavily as the broad economy grows. They like to see stable, low inflation. Some don't worry much about a gradual rise in interest rates.But top income managers also pay close attention to a company's ability to generate strong cash flow, keep their balance sheets healthy and follow through on pledges to boost cash dividends.Today, these managers also continue to see a positive environment for this area of the stock market. Why? American firms' fundamentals keep getting stronger.""Over the past few years, companies have cut costs, strengthened their balance sheets, and hence, have considerably better cash flows and operating margins to dedicate toward shareholder-friendly moves, including higher dividends,"" Linda Bakhshian, portfolio manager of $1.2 billion Federated Capital Income Fund , told IBD.""In fact, investors are demanding that management return more in dividend income now.""Through Sept. 30, the fund sports an annualized pretax return of 7.2% since its May 27, 1988 inception. Its 12-month yield is 5.73%.Clamoring For CashBakhshian offers another reason why income stocks continue to do well. The mindset of the 2010s is very different from the 1980s and 1990s. Back then, market players generally frowned upon managements who returned cash to shareholders instead of reinvesting in the business.""That stigma no longer holds,"" she said. ""Investors are more vigilant and more vocal about what they would like to see from management, and returning cash to shareholders is a key priority. Just look at how much more shareholder activism there is in the marketplace.""Today, Bakhshian sees potential increases in cash payouts among technology firms. Indeed, a few of the biggest stars in the sector — from Apple (AAPL) (95 Composite Rating, current annual yield of 1.8%) to Microsoft (MSFT) (66 Composite, 2.8% yield) to Qualcomm (QCOM) (84 Composite, 2.3%) — dish out billions of dollars in dividends each year.As of May 31, information technology made up 9.5% of the fund's equities component. Energy was the top sector component, making up 20.7%, followed by financials at 11.8%, industrials 11.1% and utilities and consumer staples at 8.2% each.Other top-performing managers look for stocks that show less propensity for big swings in fundamentals and a greater tendency for highly reliable numbers in terms of profits, sales and margins.""You are looking for a stable, lower volatility investment, from a well capitalized company, that is increasing dividends and paying out a higher yield,"" Bryan Sadoff of Milwaukee-based family-run investment advisory Sadoff Investments, which has $850 million under management, told IBD.So, what issues remain on fund managers' minds before they go to bed each night?The European economy is a hot issue. The conflict between Ukraine and Russia continues to smolder, with the potential to put the brakes on the region's still-fragile recovery.""We are concerned that a slower European economy and a weaker euro may impact the overall pace of S&P 500 company earnings into the fourth quarter of this year and 2015 and erode CEO confidence,"" Bakhshian said.Early Rate Hikes Mean LittleAs of the Oct. 2 IBD, the dividend yield of the S&P 500 benchmark was 2%.Sadoff is more concerned about three other potential developments that could damage the economy and thus dim or even destroy the prospects of dividends paid by companies: 1.)

Yet once the general market returns to a strong uptrend, the stock can break out and ramp up quickly to new highs.An ascending base is typically not a first-stage pattern. It tends to form after a stock has already staged a breakout out from a cup, cup-with-handle base or double-bottom pattern and climbed at least 20%. Like any other base, you want to see a strong prior uptrend in the stock's chart.Pullbacks Come In ThreesThe key distinguishing feature in an ascending base is that it involves a series of three pullbacks. Each one should generally range from 10% to 20% from the most recent high to low.Each pullback needs to create a higher high and a higher low. If it doesn't, you don't have an ascending base.Sometimes, the stock will pull back to its 10-week moving average, but this doesn't have to be the case. Also, when you find a stock that makes a third test of its 10-week line, look a little closer; it just might be an ascending base.Because there are more parts to an ascending base, it typically takes more time to form. A good one generally takes place over a period of nine to 16 weeks.Just like other IBD patterns, in order to get the buy point in an ascending base, just add 10 cents to the high of the third pullback. Do not buy if the stock is extended more than 5% past that prime entry point.San Diego-based wireless chip design leader Qualcomm (QCOM) had a monster advance in the late 1990s. The stock broke out from a cup-with-handle base in January 1999. It went on a huge run and stayed above its 10-week line until late May. After coming out of that pullback, the stock made a series of several mild retreats starting in early August.Qualcomm then pulled back in September and October. This marked the three distinct pullbacks for the ascending base (1).Qualcomm blew past the pattern's 56.62 buy point (adjusted for a 4-for-1 split in late December) in the week ended Nov. 5 in huge volume. Just before the breakout, the stock had solid IBD Ratings.Its Earnings Per Share and Relative Price Strength Ratings were both 99 — the highest possible. Qualcomm's Accumulation/Distribution Rating was positive at B and its Industry Group Rating was B.Qualcomm more than tripled before making a sharp pullback of more than 50% by late April 2000 (2).

1858,QCOM,"Major averages ended mixed Wednesday. The Nasdaq lagged, but not by much, weighed down by weakness in 3D printing, solar, security and online travel stocks.At the close, the Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 scored new closing highs, rising 0.6% each. The Nasdaq fell less than 0.1%, masking weak performances by many leading growth stocks. Preliminary data showed Nasdaq volume coming in slightly higher than Tuesday. NYSE was very close to Tuesday's level.Gold continued its free fall, dropping another $22, or 1.9% to $1,145.70 an ounce. Crude oil snapped back after recent weakness. It settled at $78.68 a barrel, up 1.9% after a U.S. supply report showed a smaller-than-expected increase in crude stocks.In the stock market today, small-cap Paycom Software (PAYC) was a big winner Wednesday as shares jumped 19%. It gapped up over a 19.34 buy point after reporting strong earnings late Tuesday and issuing a strong sales outlook for the fourth quarter.Meanwhile, about 20 names in the IBD 50 fell 1% or more, but there were some bright spots. NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) added 5% after the Dutch supplier of wireless chips said it plans to lure customers by putting a greater emphasis on security for connected devices. NXP is working on a seven-week, cup-shaped base with a buy point of 73.92.Other outperformers in the IBD 50 included chip designer Cavium (CAVM). Shares rose 3%. After a failed breakout over 53.41, Cavium is back above its 10-week moving average as its works on a new base.Another chip designer, Avago Techologies (AVGO), also outperformed, rising nearly 2%.

1871,QCOM,"When a bird watcher spots a rare find, he might not know the species. But at least it's clear that he is looking at a bird.The challenge posed by a base called the high, tight flag is very different. Unless investors have studied the pattern and know its characteristics, they might not recognize that it is a base at all.A fast-rising stock could quickly consolidate, break past a buy point and charge on to serious gains. The unwitting investor would never have known this was a rare bird or that there was an opportunity missed.A high, tight flag has three distinct elements. First, a stock must gain 100% to 120% in a span of four to eight weeks. That forms the flagpole upon which to hang your high, tight flag.The second element, the flag itself, forms as the stock pulls back, usually 10% to 20% or sometimes 25%, in the next three to five weeks. Price patterns are often wide and loose during these weeks — trading doesn't have to be tight, as the name implies. But the action appears tight vs. the steep run-up before the base.Similar to the handle portion for a cup-with-handle base, volume generally dries up. Big fund managers are holding the stock.Element number three is the breakout, when the stock clears the peak of the flagpole in big turnover, meaning daily volume that's at least 40% above average.Stocks that have cleared the bases form an impressive crew. Google (GOOGL) formed an imperfect high, tight flag right after its August 2004 debut.Stun-gun company Taser International (TASR) formed the pattern in 2003. Tech innovator Qualcomm (QCOM) shaped it in 1999.High, tight flags are high-risk bases. Many fail. Investors must keep a close eye on stocks climbing out of such a pattern. High-flying, China-based stocks have recently seemed especially prone to forming and then faltering out of such patterns.JinkoSolar (JKS) broke out from a high, tight flag in November 2010, then immediately began to unravel. NQ Mobile (NQ) broke out in September 2013, rose not quite 30% in the next month, then collapsed 57% in a single week.American Dairy tried to weave a flag in the summer of 2009. It climbed in heavy trade to within a dime of the buy point, then dropped 55% in two weeks.A much more positive example: JDS Uniphase (JDSU) near the end of 1999. The stock bounced off its 10-week line near mid-October and advanced 136% in six weeks. It pulled back 23% in the next three weeks. Weekly trading ranges were a little wild and wooly, but the closes were relatively tight.The stock broke out past the 68.43 buy point (adjusted for two 2-for-1 stock splits) in the week ended Dec. 24. Volume was quiet, not a big surprise during a holiday week. Trade picked up on Dec. 27, then more seriously at the start of January.JDS rose 124% before topping in the first week of March.

1875,QCOM,"When Ron Black joined Rambus as president and chief executive in June 2012, the company's earnings and revenue were falling, and the next month, Rambus stock would touch a 10-year low below 4.
"
1876,QCOM,"Black's task: refocus Rambus (RMBS).
"
1877,QCOM,"The company, which licenses its designs for memory and application-specific chips, began working more closely with customers after ending long-running patent feuds with chip companies, including SK Hynix and Micron Technology (MU), that had hindered its growth. Black laid off 75 employees, 15% of the workforce, in 2012 to curb costs.
"
1878,QCOM,"Today, Rambus' year-over-year revenue has grown by double digits the past four quarters, while EPS has reached triple-digit growth twice in that span.
"
1879,QCOM,"And Rambus stock is up more than 35% this year.
"
1880,QCOM,"Black recently spoke with IBD about the company's turnaround.
"
1881,QCOM,"IBD: Is Rambus a turnaround story?
"
1882,QCOM,"Black: I would characterize it as a rebound. The original strategy was to monetize patents through aggressive tactics and litigation. That worked for a while, but it's really not an optimum way to create value for shareholders.
"
1883,QCOM,"Last year, we settled a patent litigation (suit with Hynix). Instead of being in conflict with customers, we said, ""Let's use our technical expertise to work with them."" This is the kind of thing we couldn't have ever done before with this litigious past.
"
1884,QCOM,"IBD: What other changes did you make?
"
1885,QCOM,"Black: We were burning cash. The market cap was $400 million or $500 million. We were going to be in a net negative cash position and we had a convertible (debt loan) that was coming due in 12 to 18 months.
"
1886,QCOM,"We had to do a workforce reduction. The company was rather fat on the G&A (general and administrative) side. (The job cuts) saved $35 million in annual expense.
"
1887,QCOM,"We also stopped investing in some things that weren't going to drive shareholder value.
"
1888,QCOM,"IBD: Is the company also benefiting from a renewed memory industry?
"
1889,QCOM,"Black: It helps. If a customer is making money, it's easier for them to pay you than if they are not. The fact that the memory business is profitable allows them to look at strategic alternatives.
"
1890,QCOM,"IBD: Company revenue rose 32% in Q2 primarily because of license agreements with Micron, Qualcomm (QCOM) and others. Why are those deals important?
"
1891,QCOM,"Black: We solve hard engineering problems for customers. We create intellectual property in the form of designs and patents. The designs are something that you can integrate into a semiconductor chip, and the patents give you the rights to use those designs.
"
1892,QCOM,"We show the industry these leadership capabilities. The industry integrates them into their products. Those deals are a combination of technology and patent licenses.
"
1893,QCOM,"IBD: Where does your revenue come from?
"
1894,QCOM,"Black: About 50% is from dynamic random access memory used in computers, tablets, handsets and data centers. The companies that use them are Hynix, Micron and Samsung.
"
1895,QCOM,"The other half is licensing to system-on-a-chip companies like Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), which make microprocessors or application-specific integrated circuits, those other things that connect to memory devices. We also license security products, cryptography and computational imaging, which is how you use processing to actually improve still photos and video and LEDs, or light-emitting diodes — little chips that emanate light.
"
1896,QCOM,"IBD: Why license chip designs instead of making chips yourself?
"
1897,QCOM,"Black: The industry largely has gone to a fabless model (where most chipmakers don't actually manufacture their chips in fabrication plants). Very few companies can afford to develop the process technology that makes the chip and invest in the manufacturing. It's about $500 million a year for process technology and many billions of dollars to build a fab.
"
1898,QCOM,"What makes Rambus interesting is companies pay for long-term agreements of between five and 10 years. It gives a long period to collaborate on things and generates a lot of revenue over a period of time.
"
1899,QCOM,"IBD: How has your profit risen by triple-digit percentages over the past four quarters?
"
1900,QCOM,"Black: We did a reduction in force to control expenses. The company was not as focused on expense control. By having a tight control on expenses, it means that engineers can't keep doing A and B (projects); they have to chose A or B. And through that choice, we tend to get superior results. Tight expense control produces better results.
"
1901,QCOM,"IBD: In Q2, Rambus beat analyst revenue estimates by $3 million. Why is your Q3 revenue projection flat to below vs. the year-earlier number?
"
1902,QCOM,"Black: In the first half of this year we closed deals we had planned to close in the second half, so some things just happened earlier than we had anticipated.
"
1903,QCOM,"IBD: In June, Qualcomm became the first company to license the Rambus Cryptomanager. What is that product? Do you expect to sign more customers this year?
"
1904,QCOM,"Black: It provides security (to chips) throughout the manufacturing process. During the (manufacturing) process, people can hack the device (chip). They can put nasty things in there. Or they can steal it.
"
1905,QCOM,"(With our product) you can turn off the chip and make it unusable without the code we provide.
"
1906,QCOM,"The other thing it does is control the configuration, the different capabilities on it. You can say, 'I want function A and function B to work, but I don't want functions C, D, E and F to work.' We give (customers) a secret key to control that.
"
1907,QCOM,"Qualcomm is the lead customer, and we are working with many others to try to expand that base.
"
1908,QCOM,"IBD: What's the company's biggest challenge?
"
1909,QCOM,"Black: It's about just continuing what we are doing and growing more both organically and inorganically. We are very proactive in looking at acquisitions. The question is: How fast can we grow this company?When Ron Black joined Rambus as president and chief executive in June 2012, the company's earnings and revenue were falling, and the next month, Rambus stock would touch a 10-year low below 4.Black's task: refocus Rambus (RMBS).The company, which licenses its designs for memory and application-specific chips, began working more closely with customers after ending long-running patent feuds with chip companies, including SK Hynix and Micron Technology (MU), that had hindered its growth.

Or they can steal it.(With our product) you can turn off the chip and make it unusable without the code we provide.The other thing it does is control the configuration, the different capabilities on it. You can say, 'I want function A and function B to work, but I don't want functions C, D, E and F to work.' We give (customers) a secret key to control that.Qualcomm is the lead customer, and we are working with many others to try to expand that base.IBD: What's the company's biggest challenge?Black: It's about just continuing what we are doing and growing more both organically and inorganically. We are very proactive in looking at acquisitions. The question is: How fast can we grow this company?

"
1931,QCOM,"How do you follow a legend?
"
1932,QCOM,"That's been one of the challenges for Sam Peters, who has been lead manager of $2.7 billion ClearBridge Value since taking the baton from Bill Miller about two years ago.
"
1933,QCOM,"Miller — who still runs $2.1 billion Legg Mason Opportunity — ran Value from its April 16, 1982 inception until April 30, 2012. He famously beat the broad stock market as measured by the S&P 500 for 15 years in a row — from 1991 to 2005.
"
1934,QCOM,"Miller's winning streak came to an end. Peters joined as co-manager in late 2010 and took the lead in April 2012.
"
1935,QCOM,"Peters has made progress in returning Value to the apex among top mutual funds. The fund beat 24% of its large-cap blend peers in 2011, 46% in 2013 and is ahead of 83% this year through July 31, says Morningstar Inc.
"
1936,QCOM,"The fund changed its brand name from Legg Mason on March 1.
"
1937,QCOM,"Peters, 45, discussed his investment approach from his office overlooking Baltimore Inner Harbor.
"
1938,QCOM,"IBD: Is the crux of your strategy the pursuit of mispriced stocks?
"
1939,QCOM,"Peters: We look at traditional growth stocks and traditional value stocks. We go up and down the quality spectrum. We try to come up with a reasonable range of business values (for a stock) under future scenarios. I'm a valuation manager. But the real expertise is looking at stocks and free cash flow analysis, then over time figuring out what powers a stock's return and finding those with a price-to-value gap.
"
1940,QCOM,"IBD: Many people say no one can do that consistently for long periods.
"
1941,QCOM,"Peters: Any time you're an active manager, you have to take a humble approach. The market's tough to beat. Once an analyst comes to me with a stock whose valuation is 60 or 70 or 80 cents to the dollar, I ask what is the market getting wrong? I look for things that strengthen or weaken the investment case. I look for reasons why the market's expectations are wrong. Most of the time, it is not wrong. We look at hundreds of stocks to find a few where the market is wrong.
"
1942,QCOM,"IBD: How come you don't end up with a lot of broken stocks?
"
1943,QCOM,"Peters: I don't want Frankenstein. I want the most diversification I can get in a concentrated portfolio — I own only 40 to 50 names — but I don't want to pay for it. We've got to be disciplined. It takes time for (mispriced stocks') price and value to converge. That's why our average holding period is three-plus years.
"
1944,QCOM,"IBD: How does your approach differ from Bill Miller's?
"
1945,QCOM,"Peters: I became co-manager in November 2010. He was a good coach. I started changing some things. He encouraged me. I like to cast my net wider, for example. We were very underweight in health care when I came on board. And I have a health care stocks background. So we went from 4% underweight (vs. the S&P 500) to about 6% overweight. I cut some financials and housing stock to do that. I also sold some tech names.
"
1946,QCOM,"We're overweight energy. We weren't when I came on board. We're very overweight financials now and we're overweight tech. Health care peaked at 6% overweight earlier this year.
"
1947,QCOM,"IBD: For people who may not know, what is your health care background?
"
1948,QCOM,"Peters: I managed the global health care team at Fidelity and managed Fidelity Select Health Care and Select Medical Equipment funds from January 2004 to April 2005.
"
1949,QCOM,"IBD: How else does your approach differ from Miller's?
"
1950,QCOM,"Peters: Take breadth. Let's say there are 10 great price gap stocks. If two are home runs you can hit out of the park, Bill will concentrate on those. I'll take more names, even if there's less upside. I'll add four or five nice valuation bets and diversify the fund more.
"
1951,QCOM,"IBD: Is the purpose of added diversification to cut volatility?
"
1952,QCOM,"Peters: It's not necessarily to make the fund less volatile. But the result is that it is less volatile over time.
"
1953,QCOM,"IBD: What's your biggest bet?
"
1954,QCOM,"Peters: I'll answer that this way. My biggest overweight is a bet on higher interest rates. That's moved against me year-to-date, but I'm still ahead of the market.
"
1955,QCOM,"IBD: Do you still pick Miller's brain?
"
1956,QCOM,"Peters: He's been my biggest mentor. Always will be. We are very close friends. I have the utmost respect for him.
"
1957,QCOM,"He was relieved when I charted my own course. That contrarian streak in buying negative price momentum and being differentiated, that got reinforced by and I learned a lot from Bill. I learned about being intellectually diverse, reading widely, talking with people, not being dogmatic, all from Bill. Yet it allowed me to be different from Bill.
"
1958,QCOM,"We talk investing, but we rarely talk individual names.
"
1959,QCOM,"Bill is a huge contrarian (too). We share that common DNA, and he pushed me to really think for myself and look at the facts, which is essential if you are going to have a contrarian approach. Be contrary to opinions and not facts.
"
1960,QCOM,"IBD: How much skin do you have in the game?
"
1961,QCOM,"Peters: I'm one of the larger shareholders in the fund, which is how it should be. It's the largest chunk of my net worth. My SEC disclosure has me over the $1 million mark. When I get bonuses, I add to the fund. I am the largest individual shareholder in the fund, though some institutional shareholders have more.
"
1962,QCOM,"IBD: Your June disclosure shows your stake in Apple (AAPL) jumped to 1.3 million shares from 205,000 as of April 30. Apple had a 7-for-1 split, so did you also trim?
"
1963,QCOM,"Peters: Yes, Apple had a split, and I've actually been trimming.
"
1964,QCOM,"I typically buy when a negative narrative goes too far. I get excited if the hurdle goes from 4 feet high to an inch high. That was the case with Apple at 400. At 650 it's a tougher case. (Post-split Apple is trading around 95.)
"
1965,QCOM,"People are excited about a 6-inch screen (on the iPhone) and a watch that are supposedly coming.
"
1966,QCOM,"But Apple is discounting flattish margins. It is discounting some growth. And it's a higher hurdle to jump over. It's not massively overvalued. But it's less interesting than it was.
"
1967,QCOM,"IBD: Celgene (CELG) is another recent split, right?
"
1968,QCOM,"Peters: It is. This is a classic for us. We got involved before the big biotech run, when it was a value stock. When I joined the fund, health care was in the dumps.
"
1969,QCOM,"I love positive price momentum. I just don't want to pay for it. We trimmed before biotech got hit in March. Then when Celgene got sold (by the market) in Q2 we added back when expectations got reset. I think Celgene will be a long-term winner. And we think Celgene will prevail on its Revlimid patents (in its court fight against Natco, which is developing a generic rival for Revlimid).
"
1970,QCOM,"IBD: Is fracking the bedrock of your Halliburton (HAL) play?
"
1971,QCOM,"Peters: They put straws a mile down into the ground, go out 5,000 feet horizontally, then blow up rock underground to drive more oil up. The more complex those wells are, the better the economics for Halliburton.
"
1972,QCOM,"What we noticed about the shale revolution is that rig productivity is doubling every three years, which is amazing. Halliburton is capturing a lot of those efficiencies.
"
1973,QCOM,"IBD: Why did you trim Broadcom (BRCM) between April and June?
"
1974,QCOM,"Peters: This was classic for us. Broadcom was doing some bad things, throwing huge amounts of money into chasing Qualcomm's (QCOM) monopoly in baseband chips. They made no headway. They diluted their own fundamentals on an uneconomical bet.
"
1975,QCOM,"They ended up with the lowest valuation of all large-cap semiconductor stocks. We bought when everyone told us we shouldn't. It was in the high 20s. (Now it's trading in the high 30s.) It was so bad, it was good. We thought they would get pressure from employees, shareholders, their own board to fix things. We felt if they made changes for the better, the stock would go up a lot.
"
1976,QCOM,"And last quarter, lo and behold they said 'Uncle.' They stopped chasing Qualcomm's monopoly in baseband. They said they'd give back more to shareholders. Profit margins would go up. So you'll see positive earnings revisions.
"
1977,QCOM,"We still think the business value is higher, somewhere in the 40s. Now it has positive momentum. We have a big position. So you'll see us trim a little.
"
1978,QCOM,"IBD: Calpine (CPN) earnings-per-share growth has accelerated for three quarters. What's your thesis?
"
1979,QCOM,"Peters: We began buying early this year around 19. Late first quarter, early second quarter. They're taking a 12% free cash flow yield, which is extremely high, and buying back a lot of stock. So we got in effect a high tax-efficient yield. In a 2.5% 10-year Treasury world, that's a good way to win.
"
1980,QCOM,"We (the U.S.) reward underbuilding utility power supply in the U.S. Especially in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Maryland. We're having lots of coal utility retirements. We're not building new nukes (power plants). So power supply is getting tighter. We think this will set up a lot of power pricing volatility. Which is great for Calpine.
"
1981,QCOM,"IBD: UnitedHealth Group (UNH) is uptrending despite modest EPS results. What's your view?
"
1982,QCOM,"Peters: They got hit with negative earnings revisions due to ObamaCare. But the stock was cheap enough to withstand it. Now estimates have stabilized. They have growth in services, growth in their core managed care side. Mixed with low valuation and better earnings as we look into 2015, it will result in a nice stock. A low valuation lets you be timing agnostic.
"
1983,QCOM,"IBD: When did Expedia (EXPE) look like a value play to you?
"
1984,QCOM,"Peters: We bought it last fall when it stumbled on earnings last summer. It became very cheap.
"
1985,QCOM,"I met management in the fall and became comfortable that they had gotten their technology platform in good enough shape to manage pressure from Priceline (PCLN). I felt we should see positive earnings surprises against a lower bar.
"
1986,QCOM,"And we think the online travel space is a good cash generator.
"
1987,QCOM,"IBD: What do you like about truck and parts maker Paccar (PCAR)?
"
1988,QCOM,"Peters: Trucking capacity is getting tight. You can't get drivers. And the (national) fleet is getting old, so it's set for a replacement cycle in a big way. That's building a big fundamental tailwind for Paccar. And they're good about capital allocation.
"
1989,QCOM,"IBD: Dr Pepper Snapple (DPS) is uptrending, so why do you still like it?
"
1990,QCOM,"Peters: They've done a good job turning no top-line growth into bottom-line growth by smart capital allocations. And they're buying back a lot of stock well below its business value.
"
1991,QCOM,"They've driven profit margins higher and rationalized their business. Also — and this bothers me a little — people have been looking for domestic plays. Dr Pepper is a North American beverage play unlike Coke (KO) and Pepsi (PEP). Its valuation is getting less attractive. But we're still holding it.
"
1992,QCOM,"IBD: What bothers you about investors liking U.S. stocks?
"
1993,QCOM,"Peters: We try and find uncrowded games, and the U.S. is seen as the safe zone right now. That may be true, but high investor expectations and crowding make it a risk.
"
1994,QCOM,"IBD: Wells Fargo (WFC) has met or topped consensus expectations in recent quarters. What else do you like?
"
1995,QCOM,"Peters: They're incredibly well managed. After their last stress test regulators said basically that they can return about 100% of their earnings to shareholders if they want to, which is unprecedented, with Citigroup (C) hanging out at zero. And they're dominant in the mortgage market. Return on equity is well into the double digits. They're selling below business value. And if we get higher interest rates, that's going to be good for large banks and life insurers.How do you follow a legend?That's been one of the challenges for Sam Peters, who has been lead manager of $2.7 billion ClearBridge Value since taking the baton from Bill Miller about two years ago.Miller — who still runs $2.1 billion Legg Mason Opportunity — ran Value from its April 16, 1982 inception until April 30, 2012.

It takes time for (mispriced stocks') price and value to converge.

We're having lots of coal utility retirements. We're not building new nukes (power plants). So power supply is getting tighter. We think this will set up a lot of power pricing volatility. Which is great for Calpine.IBD: UnitedHealth Group (UNH) is uptrending despite modest EPS results. What's your view?Peters: They got hit with negative earnings revisions due to ObamaCare. But the stock was cheap enough to withstand it. Now estimates have stabilized. They have growth in services, growth in their core managed care side. Mixed with low valuation and better earnings as we look into 2015, it will result in a nice stock. A low valuation lets you be timing agnostic.IBD: When did Expedia (EXPE) look like a value play to you?Peters: We bought it last fall when it stumbled on earnings last summer. It became very cheap.I met management in the fall and became comfortable that they had gotten their technology platform in good enough shape to manage pressure from Priceline (PCLN). I felt we should see positive earnings surprises against a lower bar.And we think the online travel space is a good cash generator.IBD: What do you like about truck and parts maker Paccar (PCAR)?Peters: Trucking capacity is getting tight. You can't get drivers. And the (national) fleet is getting old, so it's set for a replacement cycle in a big way. That's building a big fundamental tailwind for Paccar. And they're good about capital allocation.IBD: Dr Pepper Snapple (DPS) is uptrending, so why do you still like it?Peters: They've done a good job turning no top-line growth into bottom-line growth by smart capital allocations. And they're buying back a lot of stock well below its business value.They've driven profit margins higher and rationalized their business. Also — and this bothers me a little — people have been looking for domestic plays. Dr Pepper is a North American beverage play unlike Coke (KO) and Pepsi (PEP). Its valuation is getting less attractive. But we're still holding it.IBD: What bothers you about investors liking U.S. stocks?Peters: We try and find uncrowded games, and the U.S. is seen as the safe zone right now. That may be true, but high investor expectations and crowding make it a risk.IBD: Wells Fargo (WFC) has met or topped consensus expectations in recent quarters. What else do you like?Peters: They're incredibly well managed. After their last stress test regulators said basically that they can return about 100% of their earnings to shareholders if they want to, which is unprecedented, with Citigroup (C) hanging out at zero. And they're dominant in the mortgage market. Return on equity is well into the double digits. They're selling below business value. And if we get higher interest rates, that's going to be good for large banks and life insurers.

That growth rate far outpaced the industry's average sales growth rate of 10%, according to Thomson Reuters.Meanwhile, Monolithic's stock price touched an all-time high of 43.49 on July 1 and is up about 20% since the beginning of the year.Using a fabless business model, Monolithic focuses solely on design and engineering. It outsources manufacturing to a third party to keep costs low.This model has helped Monolithic produce steady profits through the years, even though profit growth has fluctuated. First-quarter earnings this year more than doubled from a year earlier to 39 cents a share, topping analyst views for 33 cents.Monolithic is due to report second-quarter results on July 24. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect EPS of 35 cents, a gain of 46% from the prior year. Sales are seen rising 16% to $67.1 million.On June 9, the company announced that it will pay a dividend of 15 cents per share for the second quarter.""Their dividend initiation is a signal to the investing world that they're confident in their near-term and long-term outlook,"" Lucarelli said. ""They plan on growing that as the design wins turn into revenues. They want to make shares more attractive to shareholders.""More Growth AheadAngelo Zino, an analyst at S&P Capital IQ, says that Monolithic can generate sales growth at an annualized rate of over 20% per year over the next three to five years.""There has been a major transformation that's taken place since 2011,"" Zino said. ""They've been able to diversify their market to new areas: industrial, automotive, cloud computing.""Consumer products used to account for about 70% of Monolithic sales. But by next year, they should account for around 50% as the company develops more components for commercial products, which carry higher profit margins, Lucarelli says.Although the consumer electronics market grows quickly, the products are not always profitable and may have short life cycles.One product that the company is bullish about is a high-current battery charger for tablets and battery packs, introduced a few quarters ago.These new chargers ""deliver the best efficiency performance in the market, which equates to faster time to charge for users,"" Monolithic Chief Financial Officer Meera Rao said.In addition, she says, Monolithic introduced the industry's first massive 900-volt flyback regulator designed specifically for industrial power-grid applications supporting wireless communication.""This product saves our customers from having to include a high-voltage blockage device,"" Rao said. ""And due to its high integration, it allows for improved ease of use, high reliability and the lowest overall solution cost.""Monolithic Power Module (MPM) solutions are roughly two years ahead of the competition and are expected to help drive Monolithic's growth over the next several years, Anil Doradla, an analyst with William Blair, wrote in a client note last month.""While the company's competition is able to offer only discrete solutions (that include multiple chips and are less power-efficient), Monolithic Power is able to differentiate its products by providing customers integrated solutions with superior performance,"" Doradla added.One risk for Monolithic is that its design wins don't guarantee that manufacturers will use its chips in their end products, and the company does not receive any payments up front.130 Days Of InventoryManufacturers might not need as many chips as they initially ordered, which can leave chipmakers with a glut of inventory. Monolithic currently has about ""$40 million in inventory, or about 130 days' worth, which is about average for them,"" Lucarelli said.The chip industry globally is split between five major players: Intel (INTC), Qualcomm (QCOM), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM), Texas Instruments (TXN) and SK Hynix.These five accounted for about 30% of industry sales and half of its profits as of 2013's third quarter, according to AlixPartners' 2014 Global Semiconductor Industry Outlook.The industry struggles with heavy price competition, high production costs and products with a short shelf life, the AlixPartners report said.Monolithic's own sales prospects are sensitive to ebbs and flows in consumer spending because of its heavy focus on consumer electronics.""If we see significant downturn in the economy or in consumer spending, that would likely have a bigger impact on Monolithic than your typical semiconductor company,"" Zino said.

"
2058,QCOM,"It's always nice to be ahead of the game. With investing, you can sometimes buy stocks at lower prices using alternative — or early — buy points.Alternative buy points can get you shares of a stock ahead of a traditional entry point, such as 10 cents above the left-side high of a cup-without-handle base.Sometimes the alternative entry can get you in several points below the standard buy point. If the breakout works, it can be a beautiful thing.There will be more work involved. You'll have to dig deeper into the charts to find them and monitor for adjustments. Be sure you are focusing on stocks with very strong fundamentals and show heavy institutional sponsorship. Finally, make sure you have frequently practiced finding and studying excellent chart patterns before engaging in this advanced trading technique.For example, one simple method involves drawing a downward-sloping trend line across the highs of a stock during its pullback within a base. The idea is to buy once the stock clears the line in heavy trade. In case of a volatile stock, you might need to redraw the line a few times.When using a standard buy point, stocks will sometimes break out, then vacillate or shake you out before moving higher. Getting in earlier may prevent you from being stopped out if a shakeout occurs once the stock passes the traditional buy point.If you get in at a lower buy point, you can use the standard buy point to add shares.But note that spotting the alternative buy point is often more of an art than science. Even alternative entries can be prone to whipsaw action. And just because a stock breaks above a downward trend line in heavy trade, it's not necessarily all good from here.IBD recently released its new Advanced Buying Strategies home study course, which covers alternative buy points in depth. Some of the buy entries covered are three weeks tight, IPO bases, breakaway gaps and a strong rebound after a shakeout. Follow-on buy points such as pullbacks to the 10-week moving average and short-stroke patterns are also covered in the course.In early 1999, wireless chip firm Qualcomm (QCOM) shaped a cup with handle with a standard 60.10 buy point. A downward trend line starting from the Nov. 3, 1998, high of 60 (1) yielded a lower entry point near 53. The stock jumped fivefold by July.
"
2059,QCOM,"Sometimes, bullish technical setups aren't hard to see at all.A stock in an uptrend, for example, pauses to catch its breath, moves sideways for a bit and a flat base takes shape. Or a stock corrects 25% to 30% from its 52-week high, then starts to climb back toward its highs. One last mild shakeout and a cup-with-handle pattern is in place.There's one pattern, though, that's not as easy to discern.The ascending base takes shape during both market uptrends and corrections, more often during the latter. It forms after a stock breaks out of an initial base. After reaching new highs, it pulls back three times, generally over a period of nine to 16 weeks.Each pullback can be anywhere from 10% to 20% (in some cases, a little more than 20%). It's important that both the high and the low of each pullback are higher than the preceding high and low, respectively. Buy shares when the stock breaks out past the high of the third pullback by a dime.AOL (AOL) formed one in the first quarter of 1999 and a strong breakout followed. Wireless tech giant Qualcomm (QCOM) formed one in the second half of 1999. A huge price gain followed just before the stock's top in early 2000.The ascending base is one of the more counterintuitive chart patterns because it looks like a stock is extended when the pattern is forming. It's common to feel like you're buying late when a stock breaks out from an ascending base. However, if it's a sound pattern, and the general market has turned or shows healthy action, then the ascending base can launch a big price move.Taro Pharmaceutical (TARO) formed one in a 12-week period between February and May 2001. The pattern formed after the stock cleared a six-week consolidation in October 2000 1. At the time, its Earnings Per Share Rating was 91, its Relative Strength Rating was 88 and its Accumulation/Distribution Rating was B.The first pullback was 14% 2; the second pullback was nearly 17% and the third pullback was 23%. Taro broke out during the week ended May 11, clearing a split-adjusted buy point of 28.05. Its Relative Strength Rating at the time was 98.Taro needed a few weeks to get the rally going. Eventually, the stock more than doubled over the next 10 weeks, just ahead of a 2-for-1 stock split in late July. The stock then dropped 43% in just nine weeks.

2157,QCOM,"At the end of the year, it's important to take a look at your past mistakes. It's also helpful to go over the market's best performers. Doing both can help you do better in the coming year.One of the winners of 2013 that's worth studying is Facebook (FB). Despite being the most highly anticipated new issue of 2012, Facebook quickly fizzled after its debut. But the stock redeemed itself this year.Like the general market, Facebook started off 2013 with a bang, surging 19% in the first two weeks. Then it got rocky, as the stock slumped 30% from its late January peak.Still, the correction let Facebook carve out a double-bottom base with a 29.17 buy point (1).The buy point from the double-bottom pattern is 10 cents above the high in the middle of the pattern. Sometimes this can be tough to spot.On July 25, Facebook staged a breakaway gap past the buy point. It opened nearly 27% above the close of the prior session in reaction to solid second-quarter earnings announced the night before.Breakaway gaps give the impression that once they happen, it's too late to buy. Yet they are signs of powerful demand, and investors should not shy away from them.Former leaders such as Intuitive Surgical (ISRG), Green Mountain Coffee Roasters (GMCR) and Qualcomm (QCOM) all had breakaway gaps in the course of their stellar runs.In most cases, investors should not buy once a stock moves 5% past a buy point in a base. On breakaway gaps, it's OK to do so. But you still must cut losses short at 7% or 8% if the stock falters.By late October this year, the stock had run to 54.83 before settling into what would become a cup-without-handle base. Before that, the stock cleared an alternative entry at 39.42 in the week ended Aug. 23 in heavy trading. From there, it jumped 39% by October.Just before it staged the breakaway gap, Facebook had mixed IBD ratings.It had a Composite Rating of 78, which is not great. Its Earnings Per Share Rating of 86 was good. But its Relative Price Strength Rating of 29 was weak.The Q2 report changed the outlook for Facebook, because a 75% surge in mobile ad sales showed a promising line of business.Also, there's no denying that Facebook had a breakthrough product that changed the way people communicate and keep in touch with friends and family.And Facebook gave other companies another avenue to promote their products and services.Facebook had mixed fundamentals. Profit was flat to up 13% in the four quarters before the July breakout. But sales grew 32% to 40% over the same period.

2173,QCOM," ARM Holdings, long the power player among chip designers for smartphones and tablets, has curbed investor concerns of waning potential and is poised for a strong 2014, analysts say.They see several possible growth drivers for ARM Holdings (ARMH), as customers such as Apple (AAPL) and Samsung roll out new products. There's also word that Google (GOOG) might design its own server processors using ARM Holdings technology, according to a Bloomberg News report last week.""I think ARM is in a phenomenal position headed into next year,"" said Evercore Partners analyst Patrick Wang. ""It is firing on all cylinders.""ARM Holdings is the second-largest firm by market cap in IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Fabless industry group, after Qualcomm (QCOM), and before Broadcom (BRCM), Avago Technologies (AVGO) and Xilinx (XLNX).Wang noted that ARM Holdings' stock rode a roller coaster over the past couple of years, dipping below 23 per share in mid-2012 and seesawing the middle of this year before recovering in the fall to approach 50 in October. It now trades just shy of that.For the downs, Wang and others have most recently blamed headlines generated by would-be competitor Intel (INTC), which has made known that it wants to carve out a big share of the smartphone and tablet market. This, the thinking went, would come at ARM Holdings' expense.Rivals And AlliancesIntel, the world's largest semiconductor company, has dominated the arena of chipmaking for conventional personal computers, but ARM, which counts Intel competitor Qualcomm among its partners, has virtually shut Intel out of the smartphone and tablet space. Yet Intel, at its investor day in November, touted expectations that sales of Intel-based tablet computers will surge past 40 million next year, a jump of more than 300%, with smartphone growth to follow.""I never want to discount Intel,"" Wang said. ""Intel has deep pockets and they really want a piece of this market.""But, he added, Intel executives also said they would consider making microprocessors based on competitors' designs, presumably including ARM Holdings, And since the latter earns royalties on its chip designs, the Intel concession ""would seem to balance things out"" for ARM Holdings.With the Intel head wind seemingly diffused for now, Wang said, ARM Holdings is now ""my top large-cap pick for next year.""Other Wall Street analysts have been upbeat too, issuing outperform and buy ratings.An easing of Intel pressure is hardly all that puts wind into ARM Holdings' sails.The Cambridge, England-based company designs the chips that go into iPhones, iPads and a plethora of other smartphones, tablets and other mobile devices. It earns royalties on every ARM-powered device shipped — accounting for about half its revenue — and collects licensing fees for products in development that use its chips.Despite a 2% year-over-year decline for the semiconductor industry in the third quarter, processor royalty revenue rose about 14% for ARM Holdings, according to the company. That missed estimates, but its licensing income swelled nearly 50%, beating expectations. And earnings per share rose 39% on 28% higher revenue, with both beating consensus views.Analysts have expressed concerns about the saturation of high-end smartphones. There are fewer royalties to be had if most people in the market for such a device already have one and sales slow. But many analysts think this could be offset by greater volumes of mid-tier smartphones being sold in high-growth markets such as China and India.Equally important, on the high-end front, was the move made this year by Apple to shift from the standard 32-bit chips to 64-bit chips in its iPhone 5S.Wang said the change was ""huge"" for two reasons. One, Apple is a major ARM Holdings customer, and two, others will follow Apple's lead.Future DevicesSamsung already has said it will follow suit in 2014. And ARM Holdings generates higher levels of royalties on the faster 64s, making each shipment more profitable.""If not for Apple, others would have taken their sweet time getting to it, but now it becomes essential. And that's a nice tail wind for ARM heading into next year,"" Wang said. ""I think ARM really got its mojo back with the Apple move, because ARM is only as good as its customers.""William Blair & Co. analyst Anil Doradla agreed. ""I like the story; I like the fundamentals,"" he said in an interview.Doradla has a ""market perform"" rating on ARM Holdings ""strictly on valuation,"" meaning he is not yet convinced that there is room for substantial advancement for the stock. He said the 64-bit chip development could help drive growth, and expansion of the mid-tier smartphone market in developing countries should provide another boost.""That market is going to be very positive,"" he said. But he thinks the stock may need another ""upside surprise"" to advance substantially.Wang said Apple may be the one to deliver such a catalyst. Looming from Apple in 2014 is a larger, roughly 12-inch iPad, expected to have a keyboard and other features associated with notebooks and personal computers. It could change the world of business travel, Wang said, and potentially ""change the PC landscape."" That could boost business for ARM Holdings as well.""I think that if and when it comes out — and all signs indicate it in fact will come out — that's the next leg of growth for ARM's stock,"" he said.In the latest news out of the company, ARM Holdings on Friday said it acquired graphics lighting company Geomerics, and that its technology could accelerate the transition to photorealistic games in mobile.ARM Holdings CEO Simon Segars said on the firm's third-quarter earnings conference call that it is increasingly licensing its chip designs to more companies, and that some of these firms are plowing into cutting-edge areas such as fingerprint recognition and wearable computing, providing new growth opportunities.""A record 48 processor licenses were signed in the (third) quarter with 24 companies,"" Segars said. That included 11 firms with their first-ever ARM license, ""many of whom are planning to take our technology into new and emerging markets.""Looking toward the fourth-quarter's results, he said, a ""record order backlog"" and ""robust opportunity pipeline"" point to a strong quarter for licensing revenue, with a sequential rise in ARM's royalty revenue.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters on average forecast EPS at 26 cents for the fourth quarter and 98 cents for 2013, then $1.24 in 2014.

Shares of Apple were down a fraction in the stock market today.More concerns about slowing growth in smartphones surfaced Wednesday as an analyst slightly lowered his outlook for Qualcomm (QCOM) and Apple (AAPL).Canaccord Genuity analyst Michael Walkley cut his price target on cellphone chipmaker Qualcomm to 84 from 85 but maintained his buy rating on the stock. He also lowered his sales estimates for the Apple iPhone.""Due to our belief the smartphone innovation curve has slowed, resulting in weaker high-tier smartphone sales growth, we have slightly lowered our 2013 and 2014 global smartphone estimates,"" Walkley wrote. He cut his 2013 smartphone unit sales estimate by 2% and by 3.5% for 2014.""However, we maintain our belief Qualcomm is well-positioned for continued strong revenue and earnings growth,"" he wrote in a research note Wednesday.Walkley lowered his iPhone unit sales estimate for the current quarter by 6.6% to 28 million from 30 million, and cut his estimate for 2014 to 173 million units from 181 million. He said sales of higher-end smartphones are weakening.He lowered his 2013 EPS estimate on Apple to $39.29 from $40.12 and 2014 EPS estimate to $44.04 from $46.80.Samsung on Friday also provided evidence that smartphone sales are slowing. Samsung Electronics missed its quarterly earnings guidance as sales of its Galaxy smartphones began to wane, as IBD reported.Shares of Qualcomm were up nearly 1.5% in midday trading Wednesday, but the stock is down 9% since May 17.

Later, he is joined by Dave Bartosiak to preview Friday morning’s big bank earnings reports.Want more video content from Zacks? Subscribe to Zacks Investment News now!Free Lunch is the newest show from Zacks Investment Research. It is streamed live, four times per week, and features breaking news and analysis from Zacks strategists. Free Lunch is available on YouTube, Facebook Live, Twitter, Ustream, and more.Up first, Ryan discusses Broadcom’s rough morning of trading after the chip behemoth announced it is purchasing CA Inc. (CA  -  Free Report) for $18.9 billion in cash. CA is a giant in the mainframe software industry, but that business is falling out of favor as customers continue to shift toward cloud computing.So why would Broadcom shell out so much cash for a dated brand? Some have said desperation after its Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report) merger fell through, while others have suggested it might be another moment of brilliance from CEO Hock Tan.Ryan digs into these reactions and gives his own perspective on the story. Next, the host analyst notes related to Netflix and Amazon which have hogged headlines this morning.Netflix shares dipped in early trading after analysts from UBS lowered their rating to neutral from buy, citing the video streaming giant’s stretched valuation. Eric Sheridan, the leading analyst on UBS’ note, credited Netflix’s work in content and technology, but ultimately described the goods news as “priced in” to the stock.On the opposite end of the spectrum was Canaccord Genuity’s note on Amazon, which included a new $2,000 price target for the e-commerce stock. Ryan discusses both notes and shares his thoughts on Netflix, Amazon, and other “FAANG” stocks on the first half of today’s show.On the second half of the episode, Ryan is joined by Zacks Strategist Dave Bartosiak to preview Friday morning’s top bank earnings reports from the likes of JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report), Citigroup (C  -  Free Report), and Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report).Rising rates should be a catalyst for these big financials, but a flattening yield curve has led to apathy from analysts—a feeling that both Dave and Ryan mirror. Nevertheless, make sure to check out the episode to hear exactly what they have to say about the big banks!The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

2272,QCOM,"Shares of Broadcom Limited (AVGO  -  Free Report) tumbled about 17% in early morning trading Thursday after the chip manufacturer announced the surprise acquisition of CA Inc. (CA  -  Free Report) in a deal valued at $18.9 billion.Broadcom will pay that sum in cash for CA, a designer of mainframe software based in New York City. The purchase comes just months after President Trump blocked the chip giant’s proposed $117 million merger with Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM  -  Free Report).Initial reactions to the Broadcom-CA deal are rife with confusion, as analysts and investors alike appear to be struggling to find a rationale for the semiconductor company’s sudden interest in the software space.“We think investors will likely be disappointed at this deal, which seems more financial engineering/PE driven than due to any strategic rationale,” wrote analyst from Evercore in a note Thursday morning.CA’s primary business is selling software for massive, mainframe computers, and admittedly, Broadcom will now be a major competitor in that industry. Its new acquisition is second only to IBM (IBM  -  Free Report) in the mainframe software business, and the firm generates a healthy $10 billion in annual cash flow from its operations.Still, some analysts have already pointed out that such a major bet on mainframe computing makes little sense in a world where customers are choosing cloud services over old-school hardware.“While CA is a departure from Broadcom's core semiconductor business, it is consistent with its track record of acquiring out-of-favor, market leaders with high cost structures,” said Jefferies analysts. “Importantly, AVGO has consistently demonstrated its ability to drive costs down and margins of its acquisitions up, often measured in 1,000s of basis points.”This sentiment from Jefferies is in harsh contrast to what some optimistic investors might point to right now: the ambition of Broadcom chief Hock Tan.Tan has helped grow the company from a relatively minor chipmaker to a worldwide titan through a number of hopeful deals, and the executive as earned the respect of many on Wall Street. Still, today’s move has brought out the most skeptical of voices.Investors have other reasons to be skeptical too, with Broadcom shares effectively flat lining over the past year despite sizeable gains for others in the semiconductor industry.What’s more, analyst sentiment was already mixed heading into today’s announcement. The firm’s current fiscal year ends in October, and looking ahead, analysts appear uncertain as to what fiscal 2019 holds for Broadcom.Over the past 60 days, AVGO has witnessed nine positive revisions to its fiscal 2019 earnings estimates, but five negative revisions have also come in during this stretch. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2019 has gained in the trailing two months but is down from where it started the current quarter at.This mixed revision activity has kept Broadcom at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for now.Want more market analysis from this author?

2273,QCOM,"Broadcom Inc. (AVGO  -  Free Report) recently entered into a definitive agreement to acquire CA, Inc (CA  -  Free Report) for $18.9 billion in cash. The chipmaker intends to enhance its long-term margins with the buyout of CA, a leading IT management software provider. The buyout is subject to CA shareholder nod and other customary regulatory approvals from Japan, European Union and the United States.Broadcom’s move of shifting headquarters to San Jose, CA from Singapore, will aid it to pursue the acquisition of Islandia, NY-based CA. The base-shift is anticipated to make the regulatory environment less complicated for Broadcom. Moreover, the company can reap the benefits of cost reduction as well as lessened competition. However, the Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report) deal still hasn’t materialized despite re-domiciliation. The issue remains a concern even for the ongoing CA agreement.Nevertheless, after fulfilling the regulatory approvals, Broadcom expects the deal to close in fourth quarter of 2018. Following the buyout, chipmaker anticipates the buyout to boost long-term adjusted EBITDA margins by more than 55%. The company envisionsthe acquisition to be immediately accretive, enabling it to continue earnings in double digit CAGR.Moreover, on a combined basis, the company expects non-GAAP revenues to be roughly $23.9 billion in the last 12 months and adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $11.6 billionFollowing the news, Broadcom’s shares were down almost 9% in pre-market trade, while that of CA went up approximately 18%. Shares of Broadcom were down owing to high debt level which the company will incur in regard to the acquisition. Moreover, its shares have returned just 0.9% in the past year underperforming the industry’s rally of 1.8%.How Will Broadcom Pay $18.9 Billion in Cash?Broadcom will incur a new committed debt to finance $18 billion while the remaining will be paid from cash on hand. Consequently, CA shareholders will obtain $44.50 per share in cash, approximately 19.6% premium over the $37.21 price on Jul 11, 2018 after market close.Notably, as on May 6, 2018, cash & cash equivalents of Broadcom were $8.2 billion compared with $7.1 billion in the previous quarter. Long-term debt was $17.5 billion at the end of the second quarter, which was flat compared with the preceding quarter level.What Prompted The Chipmaker to Bid For a Software Company?The increasing demand of IT management software solutions persuaded Broadcom to pick CA. This out-of-the-box move from the chipmaker took the shareholders, investors and analysts by surprise. Broadcom’s CEO and president Hock Tan said, “This transaction represents an important building block as we create one of the world’s leading infrastructure technology companies.”CA has been benefiting from higher Mainframe new sales as well as solid demand for its recently launched Trusted Access Manager for Z, a Mainframe solution. The previous buyouts have enhanced the software providers’ IT management, software and services portfolio. Moreover, the depth of its product portfolio and the increased efficiency offered by it has witnessed solid adoption, strengthening its business model.CA’s substantial customer base will enable Broadcom to explore the infrastructure software market and expand its TAM. The company attempts to expand mission critical technology solutions portfolio on the heels of CA’s mainframe and enterprise software businesses.Our TakeConsidering its business line, we are of the opinion that Broadcom is foraying into unfamiliar territory with this buyout. We remain inquisitive as to how it will integrate CA’s software business with the chipmaker’s methodologies. The move is in contrast with Broadcom’s previous acquisitions and it will be interesting to observe its strategy to capitalize on the potential of growing software business.However, diversification of end market and customer base bodes well for the long haul. This is anticipated to add resilience to Broadcom’s current business model.Zacks Rank & Key PickBroadcom carriesa Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You may consider Mellanox Technologies (MLNX  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), from the same industry. The company has a long-term EPS growth rate of 15%.

2274,QCOM,"The trade war is officially on with new Trump tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese imports going into effect last week. China has retaliated in a like manner, imposing tariffs on $34 billion worth of American goods. Both are at 25%. That’s a lot of extra cost that consumers will have to bear.The only thing worse is if everything threatened is actually charged, because of the implications for trade that are honestly hard to guess at right now.Sino-U.S. relations remain as sour as ever in the meantime, as struggling Chinese telecom ZTE continues to be denied U.S. parts because it dared to engage in trade with North Korea and Iran, the two countries the U.S. wishes to pressure. This despite the fact that it recently changed its leadership to comply with U.S. conditions to lift the ban. ZTE is also required to pay a $1 billion fine, place $400 million in escrow and allow outside monitoring if it wants the Commerce Department to allow some companies to do business with it.Of course, China’s MOFCOM hasn’t approved Qualcomm’s (QCOM  -  Free Report) NXP purchase, but this may not be an existential crisis for Qualcomm.The U.S. is also opposing Chinese attempts to invest in U.S. companies or in startups engaged in developing “key” technologies. The government is looking to further empower the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) to block this kind of deal. So Chinese firms are looking elsewhere.Alibaba (BABA  -  Free Report), one of the leading deal makers of China has been busy. Read on to know more:Focus on Non-U.S. MarketsWith the Trump administration going anti-China, Alibaba was involved in just one major U.S. investment this year: leading a $26.4 million funding round in a data-analysis startup called SQream Technologies. This is a far cry from the significant investments in social media company Snap, ride-sharing company Lyft, VR startup Magic Leap and online sports merchandise retailer Fanatics in the recent past.Alibaba is instead continuing investments in other emerging areas, notably Asia and the Middle east-North Africa (MENA) region.This month, the company announced the EMEA Ecosystem Partner Program to strengthen collaboration between its cloud customers and partners in the region. Its bigger partners include Intel (INTC  -  Free Report), Accenture (ACN  -  Free Report), Hashicorp, Ecritel, Altran and Micropole. The program is also available to startups via Station F, one of the largest startup campuses that has incorporated the program into its exclusive perks for startups.The focus on international markets also got it interested in popular Turkish online fashion retailer Trendyol. The two companies will work together to help Trendyol expand in Turkey and its neighboring countries. The timing and amount of investment is unknown. This follows a $600 million plan to set up a smart city concept near Dubai’s free port Jebel Ali to house 3,000 firms developing robotics, artificial intelligence and new mobile apps.Adopts Blockchain TechnologyAlibaba founder and CEO Jack Ma has talked down bitcoin technology while embracing the blockchain authentication system that backs it. The company has a big remittance business through its Ant Financial affiliate and has expressed its intention to use some of the $14 billion raised in its IPO to build the technology and solutions based on it.Blockchain is expected to bring down the cost of transferring money while speeding up transactions and making them more secure, which is probably why Ant Financial is already deploying it in a solution targeting Hong Kong’s large Pilipino working population that regularly sends money back home (that remittance was $33 billion in 2017 and 10.2% of the Philipplines’ GDP in 2016, according to the World Bank).Hong Kong is a great place to start with a number of companies already adopting the technology successfully. Singapore-based startup Toast for example, says it can transfer money in about 2 minutes. Another startup called EMO says it can transfer money in about 10. China’s Tencent has also introduced a service targeting the same remittances market through its Wechat platform.  Alibaba recently strengthened its position in Ant by acquiring a 33% stake in exchange of the then existing profit sharing arrangement (the company made a loss in the last reported period).Alicloud Surpasses IBMAccording to Synergy Research Group, Alibaba’s Aliyun moved ahead of IBM in the first quarter of 2018 to become the fourth largest provider of cloud services in the world. The company’s growth was initially driven by its strong position in the domestic market, but it has built on this position to become the second largest provider in the Asia Pacific region.Today, it is expanding the world over with some of its more illustrious customers being InterContinental Hotels Group, KPMG, Nestle, Philips, SAP, Schneider Electric and Conversant. The company generated revenue of over $2 billion in its last fiscal year. It trails Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) and Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report), all of which are growing just about as fast.AI-Powered Fashion RetailWith its artificial intelligence-powered fashion retail solution, Alibaba has attempted to do the seemingly impossible: match the fashion trends to your own preferences to suggest trendy items that may satisfy you.The system’s personalized recommendations come from its ability to read and analyze data generated by Alibaba's ecosystem, images of more than 500,000 outfits from Taobao stylists and fashion expertise from Tmall partner brands. For the more fashion-conscious, it also offers cross-brand recommendations.  A concept store embodying the technology will open on the Hong Kong Polytechnic University campus from July 4-7.Investment in China Media GroupAs the government gradually loosens its grip over firms by adopting a mixed-ownership policy change, Chinese technology giants Alibaba and Tencent are making the most of the situation. So after snapping up stakes in leading Chinese telecom company China Unicom, the two have now turned attention to media company CMC.  With a stake in the owner of English Premier League team Manchester City and a joint venture with Hollywood studio Warner Brothers Entertainment, China’s CMC is a media company with a media giant in its own right.The A-round fundraising brought in 10 billion yuan ($1.49 billion) for the company.Cozying Up with French ConglomerateThe French conglomerate Bollore Group has signed a global partnership agreement with Alibaba covering cloud computing services, clean energy, logistics and other areas including new digital technologies and innovation. Bollore controls a large logistics operation in French colonies in Africa, which could be one of the reasons it is interested in a relationship. Besides, it also controls a 20% stake in French media giant Vivendi. RecommendationsAlibaba shares carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2275,QCOM,"Qualcomm Incorporated (QCOM  -  Free Report) recently announced that it has signed a joint venture with Gizwits and Quectel to develop — Quectel BG36 — an Internet of Things (IoT) module that can run on 2G networks but is software upgradeable to narrowband IoT (NB-IoT) and LTE-M. Gizwits, a leading IoT developing firm, will provide IoT cloud services while cellular module supplier, Quectel, will manufacture the hardware. The LTE IoT modem will be supplied by Qualcomm Technologies (subsidiary of Qualcomm Incorporated), along with the wireless edge software platform. The announcement was made at the Mobile World Congress Shanghai.Essence of the Innovative ModuleNotably, the Quectel BG36 module will be compatible with China Mobile Shandong Branch network. The module also boasts a multi-year battery life. As the cellular industry transitions to the latest LTE IoT standards, the Qualcomm MDM9206 LTE IoT modem-based module could be easily upgraded to NB-IoT and eMTC over the air. The Quectel BG36 module seeks to enable the use of IoT devices on current cellular technology and accommodate changing requirements throughout the lifespan of the device, assisting solution providers to manage a large number of devices easily and reliably.Motive Behind Quectel BG36 IoT ModuleThe main challenge for developers and manufacturers in the rapidly evolving communications industry is the creation of products that can work in tandem in the current and future environment. To cite an instance, many cellular operators around the world are in the process of obsoleting their 2G networks and reuse that 2G spectrum to roll out 5G networks. In such an environment, manufacturers are facing the dilemma of continuing to use their 2G modem technology, which will work well today but is likely to lose relevance tomorrow, or going for more modern LTE technologies that have limited coverage in many regions currently. This partnership will allow developers to create and deploy cost effective and flexible IoT solutions, which can be upgraded as required with the help of Gizwits’ IoT cloud APIs. This ability to use the cloud to extend the modem’s capabilities on an IoT device is what makes the module a breakthrough innovation. The IoT module’s capability to flex and evolve along with changing requirements will be complemented with the acceleration of the global 5G standard — 5G New Radio.The partnering companies plan to make modem upgrade capabilities available through Qualcomm wireless edge services (WES) by the first half of 2019, after the year-end launch of Qualcomm WES.Price PerformanceIn the past 12 months, the stock has underperformed the industry with an average return of 0.1% compared with a 5.2% rise for the latter. It remains to be seen whether the new IoT innovation can take advantage of the evolving telecommunications industry and rake in more revenues.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderQualcomm currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the industry space are Comtech Telecommunications Corp. (CMTL  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Motorola Solutions, Inc.

2276,QCOM,"Tech stocks exposed themselves to vulnerabilities of the trade conflict on Jun 27 whenPresident Donald Trump announced plans of a clampdown on foreign investments in American technology companies. Previously, the President chalked out plans reported earlier to stop firms with at least 25% Chinese ownership from taking over U.S. tech companies.Though the latest decision was perceived by investors as a little softer stance, it could not save tech stocks from slumping. Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK  -  Free Report) was down 1.4% on Jun 27.Investors should note that the relationship between the United States and China has been in the spotlight since Trump’s election win in November 2016, as evident from the volley of verbal attacks made by Trump against China’s trade practices.Why China So Important to U.S. Tech SectorThe Chinese economy, the second largest in the world, but has been expanding at a much quicker clip than the United States. This emerging economy has aggressively been investing in U.S. companies, gradually emerging as a key origin of capital for the U.S. market.So, when both the United States and China enact a 25% tariff on each other’s $34 billion worth of goods from Jul 6, the investing world will definitely be bothered. And the tariff scenario may worsen as White House plans to enact tariffs on an extra $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, if China keeps retaliating.The pain for the tech sector is more because“semiconductor and semiconductor equipment companies have the highest revenue exposure to China at 52%” (per Morgan Stanley equity strategists). Tech Hardware & Equipment companies have about 14% sales exposure to China.Chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report) has 65% revenue exposure to China and Nvidia’s (NVDA  -  Free Report) sales exposure to China is 56%, per Goldman Sachs. Apart from these, some other tech and semiconductor companies, which have sales exposure to China in the range of 22% to 55%, include the likes of Intel (INTC  -  Free Report), Micron Technology (MU  -  Free Report) and Applied Materials (AMAT  -  Free Report). This clearly explains why the mood is especially somber in the semiconductor space. So, VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH  -  Free Report) was down more than 2.4% on Jun 27.Time for Small-Cap Tech Stocks?While these large-cap stocks are bearing high chances of getting hurt by the possible trade war, investors can take a look at small-cap technology stocks, which are more domestically focused and thus less vulnerable to souring trade relations.Stock PicksThe following tech stocks have a market cap of less than $1 billion.Xplore Technologies Corp (XPLR  -  Free Report)This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company is in the business of developing integrating and marketing mobile wireless Tablet PC computing systems.

2277,QCOM,"Qualcomm Incorporated (QCOM  -  Free Report) recently announced that it has launched the Snapdragon Wear 2500 platform, designed specifically for children’s smartwatches. Watches built with this chip will support 4G connection and help children stay in touch with family, learn from its rich multimedia content, play games and stay active throughout the day. The optimized version of Android used in the platform will protect the wearers from malicious Internet content. The announcement was made at the Mobile World Congress Shanghai.Fundamentals of the Snapdragon Wear 2500The platform, developed by the company’s subsidiary — Qualcomm Technologies — features extended battery life by up to 14% compared with the prior generation versions, integrated sensor hub with pre-optimized algorithms, low power location tracking and fifth generation 4G LTE multi-mode modem, alongside a quad-core A7 processor. The chip is capable of supporting accurate location tracking by putting the latest global navigation satellite system and sensor fusion approach in use. It supports a 5-megapixel camera, gesture-based entertainment apps and tracks physical activity. The longer battery life is the key feature of this platform and is expected to last up to four days on a single charge. It fits in a 512MB memory footprint, and is engineered to consume low power by shutting off features which are not in use.Qualcomm’s Bid to Capture an Emerging MarketThe company had developed processors for wearables earlier. However, the wearables market did not experience the type of boom that tech experts had anticipated, as consumers continued depending on their devices for notifications or fitness tracking. But demand for kids’ smartwatches is growing rapidly. In fact, according to reports, nearly half of the total global smartwatch market consists of kids’ watches. The company sees high potential in making customized processors to capture this market.Qualcomm has already started partnering with hardware firms and supplying the Wear 2500 to build the children’s smartwatches. The watches are expected to be released into the market later this year. The company’s lead customer for the Wear 2500 platform is Huawei. It is also collaborating with InvenSense, Inc. in this endeavor.Price PerformanceIn the past three months, the stock has underperformed the industry with an average return of 3.2% compared with a 6% rise for the latter. It remains to be seen whether the new processors can capture the soaring kids’ smartwatch market and rake in more revenues. Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderQualcomm currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the industry space are Comtech Telecommunications Corp. (CMTL  -  Free Report) and Motorola Solutions, Inc. (MSI  -  Free Report), each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), and Ubiquiti Networks, Inc. (UBNT  -  Free Report), carrying Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

2278,QCOM,"The ongoing trade conflict between United States and China is showing no signs of abating. The issue has escalated to a point where imposition of tariffs and retaliatory tariffs may go up to $450 billion on either side. Further, President Trump’s intention of restricting Chinese companies from investing in U.S. tech firms to prevent technology export to China is likely to add fuel to the fire.President Trump’s decision to impose tariffs does not sit well with U.S. companies that rely on Chinese imports. However, Trump’s stance on tariffs is likely to raise product prices aiding the U.S. telecom equipment manufacturing industry. Consequently, investment in some of these stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank should prove to be lucrative.National Security Concerns Dominate Tariff DecisionsTrump administration is deeply concerned about China’s drive to unseat the United States as the primary developer and supplier of products in the fields of high-tech artificial intelligence, semiconductors, quantum computing and various other digital technology driven sectors.Notably, most of the big manufacturers of these products are patronized by the Chinese government. These companies have become a serious threat to U.S. economic and military supremacy. Information technology, telecommunications and consumer electronics are the major Chinese industries which have come under first phase of U.S. tariffs worth $50 billion.   On Jun 24, The Wall Street Journal reported that the Trump administration is planning to impose more restrictions on Chinese companies. Per the report, any company with 25% or more Chinese ownership will be barred from investing in any U.S. tech companies. Likewise, U.S. tech companies will not be allowed to export technology to China.Chinese Tech Giants Targeted EarlierThe U.S. government has prohibited indigenous mobile chipset developers and optical fiber component makers from selling products to ZTE. President Trump had issued an executive order to restrict select Chinese telecommunications giants primarily ZTE and Huawei Technologies from selling products in the United States.Moreover, the U.S. government made AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report) drop Huawei smartphones from its offerings while Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM  -  Free Report) was barred from selling its chipsets to either Huawei or ZTE.On Mar 12, Trump ordered to immediately prohibit the proposed $117 billion takeover bid of Singapore-based Broadcom for Qualcomm. The government argued that third party entities, especially, Huawei and ZTE may gain access to Qualcomm’s precious patents from Broadcom. At the least, a stalled R&D activity may result in Qualcomm losing its competitive edge in the upcoming 5G wireless network standard to its Chinese counterparts.Our Top PicksPresident Trump has given enough indication that his administration will take special interest safeguarding the highly valuable patents of the American tech heavy companies from the Chinese tech behemoths.At this stage, investors will be better off to investing in U.S. telecom equipment manufacturing companies, which are expected to benefit the most from upcoming U.S. tariffs on China.We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks with favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and strong growth potential.

2279,QCOM,"Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) news from last week included its push into kids’ original programming, issues related to its repair and replace policy, a counter-aggressive measure in its patent infringement case versus Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report) and more. Here are the details-Push into Kids ContentApple is partnering with Emmy award-winning television producer Sesame Workshop to create children's programming including live-action, animated and puppet series for its new streaming service. This is the first time it’s getting into children’s programming.Sesame Workshop is best known for its ""Sesame Street"" programming, which aired on U.S. public television network PBS for nearly 50 years and now runs on HBO, with re-runs on PBS stations, but this hugely popular show isn’t part of the deal.This is the second time in as many weeks that Apple announced a major content deal and underscores its services ambitions. Just last week, it signed on Oprah Winfrey to create ""original programs that embrace her incomparable ability to connect with audiences around the world,"" likely outbidding competitors Amazon and Netflix.Repair IssuesApple was ordered by an Australian court to pay $9 million Australian dollars ($6.7 million) in penalties for refusing free repairs to users that had earlier gone to third parties for repairs. Australian law requires repair, replacement and even at times a refund when the product sold was faulty.The problem started with at least 275 Australian customers being refused repairs between Feb 2015 and Feb 2016 for an Error 53 message on their devices. Apple earlier explained this was “an unauthorized or faulty screen replacement” message designed to protect users but later retracted the statement saying it was meant to be a factory test.Whatever be the case, the Australian regulator’s investigation drove Apple to contact 5,000 affected customers and offer to compensate them.Meanwhile in the U.S., Apple is promising its now-more-vigilant users that faulty MacBook and MacBook Pro keyboards will be replaced or repaired free of cost up to four years from their date of purchase, provided that the keyboards on select models have: -Letters or characters that repeat unexpectedly- Letters or characters that do not appear when the key is pressed- Key(s) that feel ""sticky"" or do not respond in a consistent mannerIf you’ve already paid for repairs, Apple will refund your money.The problem stems from a change in the keyboard design that incorporated a “butterfly mechanism” to make the keyboard 40% thinner and more responsive. It uses V-shaped underpinnings rather than the customary X-shaped scissor connection that however affects the way the keys function, especially because of the way dust or dirt is caught inside.Qualcomm Fight DevelopmentApple has challenged four of the patents that Qualcomm accused it of infringing in a California federal court last year, saying that they didn’t cover new ideas.The patents cover ways to automatically focus a digital camera; a device that functions as both a phone and personal digital assistant; touch-sensitive displays; and circuit memory.Apple is in the habit of going to the Patent Trial and Appeal Board to cancel patents because it has an easier legal standard than courts do. In its current fiscal year ending Sep 2018, the company has filed 1,100+ such petitions.Apple Pay Enters NorwayAs promised at the last earnings call, Apple Pay has launched in the Ukraine, Poland and now, Norway. There are three supporting banks at launch including Nordea, Santander and Sbanken for customers with Visa cards. While it may not be a roaring success right at the start because of the high level of competition in the market, it is likely to attract Apple device users over time. With this launch, Apple Pay is now in 29 countries around the world.Supplier NewsHon Hai Precision Industry is the Chinese company that assembles Apple devices, or that’s how it has been more popularly known for quite some time. And yet, the company is now showing signs that its dependence on the cyclical iPhone business is going down.In 2017, around 51% of its revenues reportedly came from Apple, down from 54% in 2016. In first-quarter 2018, a weaker iPhone quarter, that revenue share is down to 45%.One-Month Price Action RecommendationApple shares carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better tech plays include buy-ranked stocks like Microchip Technology (MCHP  -  Free Report), Vishay Precision Group (VPG  -  Free Report), Match Group (MTCH  -  Free Report) and Verint Systems (VRNT  -  Free Report). Or, see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions. Apple sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years, creating a $1.7 trillion market.Zacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this fast-emerging phenomenon and 6 tickers for taking advantage of it.

2280,QCOM,"Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM  -  Free Report) is mulling over to raise bid for NXP Semiconductors NV (NXPI  -  Free Report), in order to garner support of 80% shareholders of the latter, per CNBC. Notably, on Oct 27, 2016, Qualcomm had entered into a definitive agreement with the Netherlands-based mobile chipset giant for the acquisition.Per the deal, the largest mobile chipset manufacturer would be paying $110 per NXP share in cash, reflecting an enterprise value of approximately $47 billion (equity value of $39 billion) for NXP Semiconductors. Several industry researchers have estimated that the revised price for the deal may go up to $125 - $130.Meanwhile, hedge fund Elliott Management Corp. and two other large shareholders of NXP Semiconductors have approached the company to renegotiate the terms of the deal, which they consider is grossly undervalued. Majority of the company’s shareholders are now reluctant to tender their shares at the rate specified by Qualcomm.With large blocks of stock held by hedge funds such as Elliott Management, Davidson Kempner, Och Ziff, Soroban Capital, Pentwater and D.E. Shaw, Qualcomm has no option but to raise offer price in order to get necessary approval from 80% shareholders of NXP Semiconductors.Meanwhile, in January 2018, the EC (European Commission), the regulatory authority of the European Union, gave its nod for the deal with some restrictive conditions. This came in as a major relief to Qualcomm.Advantages to QualcommThe major positive of the contract is that it will enable Qualcomm to diversify business model. The company is a leader in the mobile chipset market. However, markets for smartphones and tablets have gradually slowed down in recent years. Additionally, these chipset businesses are low-margin in nature. In fact, the company’s business has remained stagnant for the last couple of years.Meanwhile, NXP Semiconductors manufactures chips for next-generation automotive, industrial and Internet of Things (IoT) segments. Consequently, its acquisition of NXP Semiconductos will help Qualcomm diversify into highly lucrative end markets such as auto, secured devices, connectivity and secure payments. These segments offer high-margin businesses with strong potential for future growth.The takeover will also push Qualcomm up the ranks to the second position after Intel Corp. (INTC  -  Free Report) in terms of sales in the broader global semiconductor market. NXP Semiconductors is the largest manufacturer of high-performance, mixed-signal mobile chipsets with 14% market share. The company has a strong clientele serving more than 25,000 customers through its direct sales channel and a global network of distribution channel partners.The combined entity is expected to generate annual revenues of more than $30 billion. Further, it is likely to position itself as a strong player in the next-generation mobile chipset segment with a potential market size of $138 billion by 2020.Qualcomm expects the transaction to be significantly accretive to non-GAAP EPS immediately upon completion. Further, the company anticipates generating $500 million of annualized run-rate cost synergies within two years of the transaction’s closure.Price Performance of QualcommQualcomm’s shares have lost 2.8%, against the industry’s growth of 5.6% over the past 90 days. The company currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). However, a better-ranked stock in this space is Motorola Solutions Inc. (MSI  -  Free Report) carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Breaking News: Cryptocurrencies Now Bigger than VisaThe total market cap of all cryptos recently surpassed $700 billion – more than a 3,800% increase in the previous 12 months.

2281,QCOM,"Qualcomm’s (QCOM  -  Free Report) CEO Steve Mollenkopf, CFO George Davis and Chairman Paul Jacobs and other office bearers met Broadcom (AVGO  -  Free Report) representatives in a two-hour meeting. Neither party said anything about what transpired at the meeting but Broadcom representatives reportedly came away with the feeling that they were listened to without comment. Qualcomm representatives said that the board would meet to discuss the next steps.The Broadcom OfferBroadcom’s attempt to acquire Qualcomm to create a wireless powerhouse was thwarted yet again when its revised bid was rejected unanimously by Qualcomm’s board of directors.  In November, Broadcom offered $70 a share, of which $60 was to be paid in cash and the rest in shares. The revised offer, which is Broadcom’s ""best and final offer"", values each share at $82 ($60 a share in cash and the rest in shares).Considering the fact that the deal reduces competition, there’s a good chance that regulators in several countries will oppose it. If the deal is cancelled on account of regulatory opposition, Broadcom will pay $8 billion for the disruption caused.Broadcom expects to obtain necessary approvals to close the deal within a year. If it takes longer, it will pay 6% a year of the amount to be paid in cash as compensation.Since this is an unsolicited, hostile bid to take over control of the company, Broadcom is also looking to replace the entire Qualcomm board with 11 people of its own choosing. Shareholders will cast their votes on Mar 6. Is Qualcomm’s Concern Justified?Qualcomm Chairman Paul Jacobs stated in the open letter to Broadcom CEO Hock Tan, “Your proposal ascribes no value to our accretive NXP acquisition, no value for the expected resolution of our current licensing disputes and no value for the significant opportunity in 5G,"" and “Your proposal is inferior relative to our prospects as an independent company and is significantly below both trading and transaction multiples in our sector.” Moreover, the bid contains ""serious deficiencies in value and certainty.""It’s true that the automotive and IoT segments are greatly expanding Qualcomm’s addressable market, being new areas it is expanding into. Moreover, Qualcomm has also taken a lead in 5G technology development and recently announced agreements with 19 carriers and 18 handset OEMs, so it’s clearly getting ready to charge into the market. Any merger-related disruption in this schedule, or if it resulted in the loss of major customers, could come in the way of its capturing the dominant share of the market that it is targeting. So it’s true that if after this disruption, the merger doesn’t go through because of regulatory opposition, the amount proposed to be paid wouldn’t compensate Qualcomm adequately.  Also note that customers won’t be thrilled with the combination because it has the potential to become even more dominant in the wireless market, thereby driving up prices.  Summing UpQualcomm was initially not considering a buyout offer at all but it has now softened its stand because some shareholders have expressed interest in the deal should it prove to be truly attractive. Broadcom for its part, and especially CEO Hock Tan has considerable experience wrapping up acquisitions although the size of this deal makes it a different animal altogether. Whether the hostile bid for the company will be successful is still an open question.Qualcomm shares carry a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) while Broadcom shares have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Semiconductor peers worth buying instead are #1 (Strong Buy)-ranked Cabot Microelectronics Corp. (CCMP  -  Free Report), or #2 (Buy)-ranked Diodes Inc. (DIOD  -  Free Report) and Mellanox Technologies (MLNX  -  Free Report).

2283,QCOM,"The trade tensions between the United States and China have hit a fever pitch. Both will now enact a 25% tariff on each other’s $34 billion worth of goods from Jul 6. The remaining $16 billion worth of goods will be under public review. But the situation may take an uglier turn as White House plans to enact tariffs on an extra $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, if China keeps retaliating.Per an article published on CNBC, the following sectors have the highest revenue exposure to China and are thus more susceptible to the trade war.Source: Thomson Reuters, Morgan Stanley Research EstimatesOn the basis of the above-mentioned chart, we dig a little deeper into these sectors amid tariff tensions.Semiconductor Per Morgan Stanley equity strategists, “semiconductor and semiconductor equipment companies have the highest revenue exposure to China at 52%” and are thus exposed to maximum risks on rising trade tensions (read: Apple's iPhone Order Cut Report May Hurt These ETFs).Chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report) has 65% revenue exposure to China and Nvidia’s (NVDA  -  Free Report) sales exposure to China is 56%, per Goldman Sachs. Apart from these, some other tech and semiconductor companies, which have sales exposure to China in the range of 22% to 55%, include the likes of Intel (INTC  -  Free Report), Micron Technology (MU  -  Free Report) and Applied Materials AMAT. This clearly explains why the mood is somber in the semiconductor space. So, VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH  -  Free Report) may face troubles.Energy It is a two-edged sword for energy companies. First, Donald Trump’s levy of a 25% tariff on steel imports and a 10% tariff on aluminum imports from China, Canada and Mexico became a pain for U.S. oil pipeline companies. This should push up raw material prices for pipeline operators.The article published on Reuters indicated that the U.S. pipeline industry is likely to suffer cost pressure from tariffs as the industry imports about 77% of its steel requirement, according to a 2017 study on the pipeline industry (read: Is $100-a-Barrel Oil Possible? ETFs in Focus).Major U.S. energy companies including Plains All American Pipeline (PAA, Hess Corp (HES  -  Free Report) and Kinder Morgan Inc (KMI  -  Free Report) are thus on the lookout for an exemption from steel-import tariffs, per Reuters. On the other hand, China proposed “25% levies on about $1 billion a month in U.S. oil imports in retaliation for U.S. tariffs.” Energy companies have about 14% exposure to China. So, Chinese energy tariff dealt another blow to the sector.ETFs that could come under pressure are Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLE  -  Free Report) and Alerian MLP ETF (AMLP  -  Free Report).Tech Hardware & Equipment Tech companies that have extensive trade relations with China would be at high risk of falling prey to the trade war. In fact, Goldman Sachs has compiled a list of companies with considerable revenue exposure to China. These companies’ revenues are 14% exposed to China, per a CNBC article. SPDR S&P Technology Hardware ETF (XTH  -  Free Report) should thus be followed carefully.AutoBoth steel and aluminum are vital to the production of cars and trucks sold in America and would push up the sale prices of those vehicles considerably. Adding fuel to the ongoing trade tensions, the Trump administration has initiated a national security investigation into auto imports that may result in fresh tariffs (read: U.S. Auto Tariff Risk Put These ETFs and Stocks in Focus).U.S. auto companies earn about 12% revenues from China. With Beijing slamming tariffs on U.S. auto imports, First Trust NASDAQ Global Auto Index Fund (CARZ  -  Free Report) would come under pressure.Consumer ServicesAs tariff tensions heat up, inflation in the U.S. economy should perk up. Along with most market watchers, we too believe that companies will try to pass on some cost escalation to consumers. Moreover, higher inflation would give a boost to bond yields. This, in turn, might push up consumers’ borrowing costs and hurt iShares U.S. Consumer Services ETF (IYC  -  Free Report). In any case, U.S. consumer services have about 10% sales exposure to China. That is yet another risk to consumer funds.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week. Get it free >>

2285,QCOM,"The Dow traversed a difficult week, declining over three consecutive trading sessions. Investors remained concerned over the prospects of a trade war following President Trump’s decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. Trump’s decision to dismiss Secretary of State Rex Tillerson added to investors’ jitters. Ultimately, investors looking to pick up blue chip stocks on the dip helped the index finish in the green on Thursday.Last Week’s PerformanceThe Dow increased 1.8% on last Friday, moving past the 25,000 mark for the first time since Feb 28. Upbeat jobs data and lower wage growth subdued inflationary concerns and curbed rate hike fears. The U.S. economy added 313,000 jobs in February, exceeding the consensus estimate of 208,000 job additions. However, average hourly wages rose only 0.1% in February, lower than January’s 0.3% increase.The index gained 3.3% last week. President Trump signed his tariff plan into law per which fresh levies of 25% on steel imports and 10% on aluminum imports will be imposed. However, the plan excludes countries like Canada and Mexico, offering Trump a chance to renegotiate terms of the NAFTA with the two countries. Also, the United States wants to discuss national security issues with both these countries.The Dow This WeekThe index declined 0.6% on Monday. Investors remained concerned about the prospects of a trade war following Trump’s decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum. Fears of this nature dragged industrials lower during the session, a decline which weighed on the broader markets.Three Dow components from this sector, United Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report), 3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report) and The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) declined 1.9%, 0.6% and 2.9%, respectively.The index lost 0.6% on Tuesday after the Trump administration dismissed U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Additionally, Trump ordered Broadcom Inc. (AVGO  -  Free Report) to abandon the planned takeover of QUALCOMM Incorporated (QCOM  -  Free Report), following which shares of Qualcomm declined and weighed on the broader markets.Meanwhile, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased 0.2% in February, in line with the consensus estimate. This figure was lower than January’s increase of 0.5%. This development significantly reduced rate hike fears.The index decreased 1% on Wednesday, ending in the red for the third consecutive trading day following concerns over a possible trade war between the U.S. and China. Any hostile move from China will jeopardize Boeing’s performance, which is why its shares fell 2.5%, weighing on the Dow, which registered a one-day decline of around 250 points. Shares of 3M declined 1.4%.The index rebounded on Thursday, increasing 0.5%. Special counsel Robert Mueller reportedly subpoenaed Trump Organization for Trump’s business-related documents. This factor along with trade war fears weighed on investor sentiment.However, the Dow managed to post a one-day rise of around 116 points, after investors indulged in bargain hunting, seeking out blue-chip stocks on the dip. Dow component UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (UNH  -  Free Report) increased 1.8% and was the biggest contributor to the blue-chip index’s gains on the day.Components Moving the Index Apple Inc.

2288,QCOM,"President Trump’s stand on China has had technology companies on their toes, with all the CEOs going out of their ways to talk about the benefits of open markets, diversity and so forth. That’s had an unremarkable effect on tech stocks so far. In Apple’s case, which assembles its devices in China, investors have been leery of the government’s actions and their effect on Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), creating some selling pressure- Apple Gets Back in the Education GameEducation was a focus area for former CEO Steve Jobs, but it has taken a back seat in recent years as the need to drive profits took over in the absence of new “wow” products coming out of the company. But education (K-12) is an extremely important vertical because that’s when habits are formed. It does however yield lower margins because schools just can’t afford premium devices of the kind that Apple makes.As a result, the last few years have seen Alphabet’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) Chromebooks and other devices corner nearly two-thirds of the market with Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) PCs also taking a 22% share. Apple on the other hand has dropped to the third position with a 17% share, according to Bloomberg. Apple’s renewed focus on affordability with its latest set of devices and software should help the company regain some share. Read more: Apple Refocuses on EdTech, Brings Feature-Rich iPad, AppsAnalysts Slash iPhone EstimatesRosenblatt Securities' Jun Zhang lowered his iPhone X estimates saying that the product was ending its life cycle with no signs of demand picking up. Accordingly, his production forecast for the current quarter is now 1-1.5 million units a month, sown from the prior estimate of 2.5 million units.Rod Hall of Goldman Sachs lowered his total iPhone sales estimates from 54.7 million units to 53 million units for the March quarter and from 43.5 million to 40.3 million units for the June quarter. His full-year revenue estimate is also down 2.4% to $256.6 billion with the 2019 estimate down 2.7% to $272.5 billion.The analyst sees Apple having to burn down channel inventory before the next iteration of its phone launches this year. Zhang has a Buy rating and $180 price target on AAPL shares while Hall has a Neutral rating on the shares and $159 price target that was lowered from $161.Qualcomm Opposes Case Shift To UKApple has lodged 15 cases against Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report) across the world for what it calls illegal charges for its standard essential patents. In the UK, the proceedings are between the UK subsidiaries of the two companies over five patents. Apple claims that FRAND terms aren’t justified because it requires payment of a percentage of the end product so more expensive device makers end up paying more.Moreover, Qualcomm’s practice of bundling essential and non-essential patents makes it hard to determine what it’s charging for the essential patents. Now, Qualcomm says that Apple shouldn’t be filing cases all over the world since it is a California-based company and proceedings are already ongoing in that jurisdiction.Apple says such a claim falls flat since Qualcomm has also been filing cases against it all over the world. Moreover, it’s only natural that breaching competition and other laws in different jurisdictions would bring separate cases in those jurisdictions.Other News-Apple Wants Privacy Regulations: Apple’s Tim Cook has been criticizing Facebook at every possible occasion for the way it allowed the improper collection of personal data by Cambridge Analytica. Last week, he went a step further to say that “We’ve never believed that these detailed profiles of people that have incredibly deep personal information that is patched together from several sources should exist,” and that while he wasn’t generally in favor of too much regulation, he thinks that “we’re beyond that. It’s time for a set of people to think about what can be done.“Everyone should know what they’re giving up, not only the specific data point but the whole line people can draw: When I know this-plus-this-plus-this-plus-this, I can infer a whole bunch of different things,” Mr. Cook said. “That can be abused.”Technology Enabled Music Grows: According to the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), streaming music platforms like Pandora (P  -  Free Report), Spotify and Apple Music accounted for almost two-thirds of total U.S. music industry revenues in 2017, growing 50%. For the most part, they cannibalized digital downloads, which dropped 25% although physical (CDs and vinyl) also dropped 4%.The net effect was a 16.5% increase in revenue for the music industry to $8.7 billion, the first time since 1999 that it grew for two straight years. The next thing is likely to be more originals, so streaming services can differentiate themselves. At least that’s what Apple’s Jimmy Iovine hinted at last week.Chinese Rivals Launch New Phones: Huawei and Xiaomi announced new phones to take on Apple’s iPhone X and Samsung’s S9. Huawei’s P20 Premium and P20 Pro sport advanced camera features and at $804 for the basic version, is also a good bit cheaper than Apple’s $999 base iPhone X but more expensive than Samsung’s $700 device. Huawei has been making strides in Europe even as strained relations between the U.S. and China affected sales to the country.In Europe, however, it has been taking share from Apple. Xiaomi on the other hand is shipping the Mi MIX 2S, with comparable camera capabilities, a more powerful battery (that also makes the phone slightly heavier, comparable power and storage, but sacrificing on the display. For slightly lower contrast than the market leaders, which use OLED screens, the company could push out a $527 device.    TRAI Frowns on Apple Approach to Anti-Span App: Apple has been at loggerheads with the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI), which wants Apple to open up its iOS to allow its “Do Not Disturb” app broad access to a user’s contacts, call and text logs. Apple objects because that could compromise a user’s privacy, a point that is hard to get across with Google already obliging the authority because it agrees that the user should be in control of his/her own data and should have the authority to allow or block access as seen fit.Of course, Apple is right, especially in light of recent findings by the EU that clearly show how data gets connected in the back end, as a user continues to grant access to more and more apps. Apple has said that users should be able to report spam messages, and its technical team would be sitting with the TRAI to see how that could be worked out. But TRAI’s R.S. Sharma seems determined to force its hand and has said that the regulator would take legal measures.India Woos Tech Firms: India has changed its laws to allow the import of used goods, but there’s a caveat. These goods can still not be sold inside India. As long as the refurbished goods are then exported to other places and local laws related to waste treatment, health, safety and the environment are adhered to, companies like Apple can bring their stuff. The goal for the government is obviously to make the most of the fallout between the U.S. and China to make India a major exporter of refurbished goods.The benefit for U.S. firms is the same availability of abundant cheap labor that they were getting out of China. Whether the skills are available, or can be developed is the next question. At any rate, if anything comes out of this, it will obviously take time and money, as manufacturing operations are not easily moved around.   RecommendationsApple shares have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2289,QCOM,"Reinforcing his protectionist agenda, President Donald Trump sought to levy new tariffs worth up to $60 billion on China, according to Reuters. Mainly Chinese apparel, technology and telecom goods are being subjected to this tariff. This month, Trump has imposed a 25% tariff on steel imports and a 10% on aluminum imports. These tariffs are likely to push up costs and weigh on international sales of U.S. companies (read: 5 ETFs to Buy in March & Forget Trade War, Inflation Fears).The Trump administration is also reportedly mulling over “imposing investment restrictions on Chinese companies over and above the heightened national security restrictions.”Needless to say, trade war fears are rife at the moment. Already, the European Union (EU) has threatened the United States of a tit-for-tat tariff on a range of consumer, agricultural and steel products. Now China could be the next in line to levy a retaliatory tariff (read: Trade War Talks Heat Up: ETFs & Stocks in Focus).Naturally, companies that have extensive trade relations with China might face the brunt of a trade war. Technology chip suppliers selling products to manufacturers in China will also be dealt a heavy blow. In fact, Goldman Sachs compiled some companies with considerable revenue exposure to China.Let’s take a look at those companies and the related ETFs.  Likely Stock and ETF Losers Industrial Boeing China is a key market for Boeing Co (BA  -  Free Report) where it serves as the largest exporter of America. Last September, the company said that it expects China to spend about $1.1 trillion over the next 20 years, purchasing more than 7,200 airplanes. The Chinese government has indicated that it might order Airbus in place of Boeing jets if the United States spoils its trade relation with China. Shares of Boeing fell 2.5% on Mar 14.Industrial ETFs like iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF ITA, SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (DIA  -  Free Report) and Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLI  -  Free Report) are highly invested in Boeing and could thus be hit hard.Technology Skyworks Solutions Inc (SWKS  -  Free Report)The company, which makes highly innovative analog semiconductors, has 85% revenue exposure to China, per Goldman, quoted on CNBC. The stock has moderate focus on ETFs like Global X Internet of Things Thematic ETF SNSR (around 6% weight) and iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (SOXX  -  Free Report) (around 3.8% weight).Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report)The leader in 3G, 4G and next-generation wireless technologies has 69$ revenue exposure to China and has exposure in ETFs like SOXX (about 6%).NVIDIA Corp NVDAThis semiconductor company is 56% related to China and is heavy on ETFs like Global X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence Thematic ETF BOTZ (about 9% focus) and SOXX (about 8% focus).Other tech and semiconductor companies include Intel Corporation INTC, Micron Technology Inc. (MU), Applied Materials Inc. AMAT, Lam Research LRCX, Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Amphenol Corporation (APH  -  Free Report), which have sales exposure of 22% to 55%to China.Consumer Discretionary Wynn Resorts Ltd (WYNN  -  Free Report)This owner and operator of casino resorts has 64% exposure to China. The stock has around 5% focus on each of PowerShares Dynamic Leisure and Entertainment PEJ and VanEck Vectors Gaming ETF BJK.Likely Stock & ETF Winners Small-Cap Retail & Technology Since Trump’s tariff plan will take consumer goods into consideration, small-cap apparel, footwear and toys companies are likely to benefit, which do not have much foreign exposure. PowerShares S&P SmallCap Consumer Discretionary Portfolio PSCD might gain in the days ahead.As far as small-cap apparel and shoe companies are concerned, the likes of Stage Stores Inc. SSI, Boot Barn Holdings Inc. BOOT and Xcel Brands Inc (XELB) may benefit from the import tariff.There is a small-cap technology ETF for investors, namely, PowerShares S&P SmallCap Information Technology Portfolio (PSCT  -  Free Report). As far as stocks are concerned, Comtech Telecommunications Corp. (CMTL  -  Free Report) and Stoneridge Inc. (SRI  -  Free Report) are some of the companies one may consider.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?    Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week. Get it free >>

2290,QCOM,"President Donald Trump’s deliberation of imposing indefinite tariffs on Chinese imports has placed the U.S.-China trade relations on tenterhooks. Trump is also considering investment as well as travel restrictions on China.The tough stance stems from adverse findings against China in an investigation conducted by the U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974.Per CNBC, Trump has rejected a tariff proposal worth $30 billion (Euro 24.23 billion roughly) on Chinese imports for a much steeper figure of almost $60 billion (approximately Euro 48.46 billion).Trump administration is also putting pressure on China to cut its trade surplus with the United States by $100 billion. According to U.S. Census Bureau data, quoted by Reuters, U.S. trade deficit with China was a record $375 billion in 2017, “almost two-thirds of a global $566 billion U.S. trade gap.”Following the news, The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1%, the S&P 500 index lost 0.57% and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.19%. Per CNBC, the S&P industrial stocks were the worst hit, declining 1.02%.Economic Protectionism to Hurt the United StatesTrump has already imposed tariffs on steel (25%) and aluminium (10%) along with solar panel and washing machines. The President is likely to cite “national security” as the reason behind imposing tariffs and to bypass WTO regulations.The import tariff means that products imported from foreign countries (in this case expect Mexico, Canada and few others) becomes more expensive, giving a boost to domestic manufacturers of steel and aluminium. Moreover, import tariffs limit dumping of cheap quality products in the market, which China allegedly does.Trump is using a little-known section of the Tariff Act of 1930, which allows President to impose tariff of up to 50% and can also block imports completely, if required.However, tariff imposition has faced significant criticism from analysts and consumers on the fear that American manufacturing may suffer from rising steel and aluminium prices. The trade restrictions are expected to hurt downstream U.S. industries.Further, a prolonged high price of raw materials will eventually dent profitability and hurt job growth, which will be harmful for the U.S. economy.Moreover, trade partners like the European Union (EU) are gearing up to implement their own sanctions. Reportedly EU is drawing plans to impose tariffs on the Harley Davidson motorcycles and Jack Daniels bourbon.Import Tariffs to Shrink China’s GDP: How Will It Retaliate?The newly proposed $60 billion import tariff on China is now likely to target technology, telecom and apparel sectors. However, this can have an enormous impact on the overall U.S.–China relationship.Per a latest report from Business Standard, which quoted United States International Trade Commission (“ITC”) 2016 figures, electronic products (39%) and textiles & apparel (9.7%) were the principal products China imports to the United States.Moreover, according to the American Apparel and Footwear Association 98% of shoes and 97% of clothing sold in the United States is imported and most of it comes from China.Per CNBC, the United States is China’s biggest export market, accounting for more than 18% of total export. Trump’s tariff imposition is anticipated to shrink that amount significantly, resulting in collapse of businesses and job losses.Moreover, the U.S. tariff imposition can encourage its allies to become hostile toward China, further hurting export capabilities. These will eventually hurt China’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP).Although China’s trade minister has sought to calm tensions with the United States, it is widely anticipated that the country will eventually retaliate with its own sanctions not only against the United States but also against U.S. allies South Korea and Japan.China can also target well-known U.S.-based companies with tax and antitrust probes. It is a well-known fact that American companies face significant protectionism in China. In such a scenario, an escalating trade war can seriously hurt U.S.-based stocks, particularly those that have significant exposure to China.5 Stocks at RiskBoeing (BA  -  Free Report) is particularly vulnerable to any kind of retaliation from China. This was evident from the 2.5% decline in share price on Mar 14.China is poised to become the world’s biggest airplane market. In November 2017, during a state visit by Donald Trump to Beijing, Boeing inked agreement to sell 300 planes worth $37 billion at list prices with China Aviation Supplies Holding Company. Boeing estimates that China will buy as much as $1.1 trillion of aircraft over the next 20 years.Boeing faces significant competition in China from its European counterpart Airbus. Hence, any Chinese sanction can jeopardize its competitive position.The stock has returned 85.3% in the past year, significantly outperforming 15.8% rally of the S&P 500 index. Boeing sports Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.  Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) is dependent on China as a manufacturing hub. The company has set up a new research and development (R&D) center at the Shenzhen manufacturing hub in China. Hence, any sanction by China can have serious impact on its top-line growth and profitability.Moreover, China remains an important market for Apple, given the growing number of middle-class customers. In the last quarter, Greater China accounted for 20.3% of sales. The company stated that new and switching users made up more than 70% of all iPad sales in China. Moreover, 90% of the Mac sales were first time buyers and switchers in China.Apple carries Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The stock has returned 26.8% in the past year, significantly outperforming S&P 500 index.  Mobile chip-maker Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report) generates significant revenues from China primarily through royalties. The company has signed multiple licensing deals with various Chinese smartphone makers including Xiaomi and Gionee.Notably, China is the most important market for Qualcomm after the United States. The company’s long pending acquisition of NXP Semiconductors NV still needs approval in China. An escalation in trade-war between China and the United States can further delay the deal, which doesn’t bode well for the company.Qualcomm also has a Zacks Rank #3 and returned 3.1% in the past year, significantly underperforming S&P 500 index.  Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report) has roughly 400-strong network of stores across the Mainland China. The company has partnered with JD.com to compete against the likes of Alibaba as well as the U.S.-based Amazon. Walmart reportedly has a 12% stake in JD.com.Walmart in collaboration with IBM has launched a blockchain-enabled food traceability solution that finds the genuine origin of food products in the country.However, the biggest risk lies with Walmart’s Chinese suppliers in case of trade war. Import tariff on apparel can seriously hurt business, thereby disrupting Walmart’s supply chain. Moreover, the company’s investments can also come under threat.Walmart carries a Zacks Rank #3. The stock has returned 24.5% in the past year, better than the S&P 500 index.  General Electric (GE  -  Free Report) has significant exposure to China. Reportedly, the company has 37 manufacturing bases and eight research teams in the country. The company has inked partnership with a number of Chinese state firms particularly in the power sector.GE has also partnership with Silk Road infrastructure fund and state-owned China Export and Credit Insurance to offer financing services to replenish power plant constructions.The company also signed jet engine deals worth $2.5 billion during Trump’s visit to Beijing. Moreover, GE’s power division signed a partnership agreement with China Datang Group to provide gas and steam-powered turbines as well as components worth $1 billion.Considering these factors we believe GE will lose significantly if a trade war erupts between the United States and China.GE has lost 52.1% in the past year, significantly underperforming the S&P 500 index. The company has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).  Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio?Earlier this month, credit bureau Equifax announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of every 3 Americans.

2291,QCOM,"Micron Technology, Inc. (MU  -  Free Report) has been temporarily banned from selling chips in China. This dealt a severe blow to the stock price of the chipmaker, with other chip stocks following suit.But, the red-hot chip stock is, undoubtedly, ready to make a comeback. Micron, the world’s leading provider of innovative memory solutions, has had a mind-boggling run so far this year. The stock has gained 25%, compared with a 3.6% rise of the PHLX Semiconductor Index and 1.5% of the S&P 500.The chip industry, in itself, offers upside even after stellar years. From high-end gaming, emergence of Internet-of-Things (IoT) to automation demand for chips, all are skyrocketing. Meanwhile, supply is low which spells a grand period for chip stocks. Hence, it is the ideal time to capitalize on the current slump by betting on chip stocks that are poised to grow in the near term.Micron Stock Dives as China Blocks SalesChina’s Fuzhou Intermediate People’s Court has issued an authoritative warning against Micron’s Chinese holdings blocking sales of PRC 26 DRAM and NAND-linked items. This included solid-state hard drives and memory sticks. The Boise, ID-based company’s subsidiaries like the Micron Semiconductor (Xi’an) Co were earlier charged for patent infringement by Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit Co. (Jinhua) and Micron Semiconductor (Shanghai) Co. Ltd. was slapped with the same charges.Micron is already embroiled in a trade war between the United States and China, when the Chinese regulators launched an investigation into memory-chip pricing. Nonetheless, shares of the chipmaker tanked 5.5% to close at $51.48 on Jul 3 after hitting an intra-day low of $50.10. Markets remained closed on Jul 4 as the nation observed Independence Day.Shares of other semiconductor stocks did suffer due to the tussle between the Asian nation and Micron. China is fighting for advanced chip technology and knowhow, while the Trump administration intends to block additional technology exports to Beijing. Chipmakers, including Intel Corp. (INTC  -  Free Report), Nvidia Corp. (NVDA  -  Free Report) and Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM  -  Free Report), saw their shares decline 1.5%, 2.2% and 1.5% on Jul 3, respectively. The PHLX Semiconductor Index went down 1.8%, after the Chinese court ruling came out.  Micron Still Has Upside Potential, But Why?But, it isn’t doomsday for Micron or the semiconductor industry. Micron does generate half of its revenues from China, per Fact Set. However, semiconductors are components of products that are sold elsewhere added Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report). Thus, the adverse effect of high revenue exposure to China “is not as meaningful” as it can be for other industries. Micron’s chief financial officer Dave Zinsner forecasts fiscal fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of $3.23 to $3.37 a share on revenues of $8 billion to $8.4 billion, better than analysts’ projection of $3.16 on sales of $8.02 billion. In fact, the chipmaker’s fiscal third-quarter 2018 profits more than doubled from the year-ago levels, while sales surged 40%. The chipmakers net income of $3.82 billion, or $3.10 per share, on sales of $7.8 billion, was up from $5.57 billion a year ago.And luckily for investors, top analysts are optimistic about further growth ahead. Top benchmark analyst Mike Burton said that “MU has progressed from a ‘cash burn’ to a ‘cash return’ story in only two years, and we expect the stock to remain a cyclical growth name, generating increasing profits and cash flow on each respective high and low of the memory cycle.” He has raised his price target to $80 per share (55% upside potential from the current price).Micron bear UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri has upgraded the stock from “Sell” to “Hold” and raised his price target from $42 to $60 (16.5% upside potential from the current price).Semiconductor Industry in the PinkBut, why just buy Micron? Semiconductor chips are much in demand, largely due to gaming, emergence of IoT and automation.E-sports, a multiplayer video game for professional gamers, needs thousands of semiconductor chips for production, while chips are an essential part of crypto mining as these provide the processing power needed for decoding blockchain algorithms.5 Solid Chipmakers for Your Portfolio Banking on the strengths, chipmakers are positioned to make a comeback in the near term. Since the long term bodes well for stocks after the initial dip, it will be wise to invest in such stocks. Furthermore, by purchasing stocks right after a dip, investors are essentially buying shares at a discount.

2292,QCOM,"In the last five trading days, telecom stocks witnessed a sharp rise initially as China eased some foreign investment curbs but fell slightly thereafter to maintain a flat trajectory. The stocks regained the lost ground later in the week due to temporary relief to ZTE to resume some business activities.Amid the looming trade war tensions between the United States and China, the communist nation took a positive step toward easing the limits on foreign ownership in some of its closely guarded sectors. The proposed structural changes include a step-by-step increase in foreign ownership in sectors like finance, transportation, professional services and manufacturing of autos, ships and aircraft. China also published a revised ‘negative’ list for investment in free trade zones and promised to ease curbs in the telecommunications sector among others.The move was reciprocated to some extent by the U.S. administration when the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security offered partial respite to ZTE by authorizing it to resume some business activities from Jul 2 until Aug 1. This would allow China’s second biggest telecommunications equipment manufacturer to support existing networks or equipment under contracts signed on or before Apr 15 — the day on which its seven-year ban was imposed. Although ZTE’s fate post the deadline still remains clouded, it is expected to be in compliance with all the demands of the Trump government by the end of this month to evoke a suspension of the ban.      Regarding company-specific news portfolio restructuring, acquisitions and new investments for network expansion ruled the roost over the last five trading days.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    In less than three years after its launch with much fanfare in October 2015, Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report) has decided to discontinue its mobile video app Go90 from August this year. The strategic decision is largely driven by a lackluster business response from the Millennials, who are the primary target segment for the app.With rich ad formats and appealing video content, Oath has emerged as the prime business division of Verizon in the mobile video market. Accordingly, the company has decided to pull the plug on Go90 on Jul 31 and return shows and content rights to its production partners.

(T  -  Free Report) has decided to pay a fine of approximately $5.3 million to the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”). The company has also pledged to take corrective actions to avoid recurrence of the incidents that have hurt its credibility.The outages pertain to two separate events, one in March 2017 that lasted about five hours and the other in May that lasted 47 minutes. While the first incident affected 12,600 unique users, the second affected 2,600, preventing them from making emergency calls to 911.

China Mobile is reportedly the largest telecom carrier in the world with about 899 million subscribers.The long-pending application is proposed to be summarily rejected as China Mobile Communications Corp, a state-controlled firm, own almost 73% of China Mobile and would provide the Communist government undue access to the U.S. telecom market for economic espionage and intelligence collection. The company likely posed a U.S. security threat and law enforcement risk given its profound influence and control by the Government of China.

The construction work is currently progressing well, with the company expecting to connect most of the homes and businesses throughout the region by spring of 2019.With a direct connection to the TELUS PureFibre network, customers will be able to enjoy the fastest symmetrical upload, download speeds and the most reliable network technology, making it the best network available in Richmond. Moreover, this new infrastructure is believed to be the backbone of TELUS’ wireless network as it allows more wireless capacity and faster speeds and lays the groundwork for 5G technologies. (Read more: TELUS Invests $110M for Fibre Optic Network in Richmond)Price PerformanceThe following table shows the price movement of some of the major telecom stocks over the past week and during the last six months.In the last five trading days, AT&T was the major gainer with its share price increasing 3.2%. SBA Communications Corporation (SBAC  -  Free Report) was the major decliner with its stock losing 0.9%.Over the last six months, Motorola Solutions, Inc. (MSI  -  Free Report) was the best performer with its stock appreciating 19.9% while Qualcomm Incorporated (QCOM  -  Free Report) declined the most with its shares falling 19.8%.Over the last six months, the Zacks Telecommunications Services industry has underperformed the benchmark S&P 500 Index with an average fall of 10.1% compared with a decline of 1% for the latter.What’s Next in the Telecom Space?In addition to continued product launches and deployment of 5G technologies, all eyes will remain glued to the proposed $34 billion worth of U.S. tariffs on China set to be imposed by the weekend and the latter’s retaliation to it. Although China has vouched that it will not ‘fire the first shot’ in the impending trade war, it threatened to match the U.S. tariffs dollar by dollar, jeopardizing the global trade equilibrium in the aftermath.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

Ltd.Moreover, the company’s new products are likely to gain traction, particularly through original equipment manufacturer channel. Also, Qualcomm has a strong clientele serving more than 25,000 customers through its direct sales channel and global network of distribution channel partners. Such large client base enables it to tap opportunities and neutralize operating risks associated with a single market.However, shares of the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have yielded 2.1% in the past year, underperforming the industry’s average growth of 7.4%. Further, it recorded significant decline in licensing fees in second-quarter fiscal 2018 due to the ongoing dispute with Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) and other contract manufacturers. Headwinds from weaker industry conditions have also dented its margins.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the same space are Comtech Telecommunications Corp. (CMTL  -  Free Report) and Ubiquiti Networks, Inc. (UBNT  -  Free Report). While Comtech Telecommunications sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Ubiquiti Networks carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

2294,QCOM,"In the last five trading days, telecom stocks declined initially but recovered steeply thereafter, only to partially lose ground later in the week due to the still looming trade war fears with China.The on-again off-again trade war between the United States and China continued to keep the stocks in hot water as both the warring nations vowed to impose tariffs and retaliatory tariffs on each other. The issue got even murkier as other European Union nations as well as allied countries like India and Canada decided to join in the fray and impose counter tariffs against the United States. The never-ending saga is likely to have no near-term solution as President Trump has threatened ‘reciprocity’ against trade partners who retaliate against it.Meanwhile, some U.S. lawmakers continued to stonewall China’s telecom firm Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd. by urging Alphabet Inc.’s Google to reconsider its decision to maintain business relationship with it. Citing national security threats, they pleaded the telecom behemoth to sever ties with Huawei and protect the unlawful use of sensitive client data.        Regarding company-specific news, technology collaborations, acquisitions and new product launches ruled the roost over the last five trading days.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Confirming industry grapevines, AT&T Inc.

2295,QCOM,"Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) CEO Brian Krzanich was forced to resign after internal and external auditors discovered that he had a past consensual relationship with a direct reportee in contravention of the company’s non-fraternization policy for managers. It ended his 30+-year stint at the company that he joined in 1982 to eventually lead as COO and then for the last five years, as CEO.He may pick up as much as $44.5 million as a severance package, with around $37.5 million in stock awards and around $7 million on various accounts including deferred compensation, medical benefits and his pension plan.Intel stock dropped around 2.4% on the news.His leadership has been both good and bad for investors:For one thing, he oversaw the departure of several Intel veterans including data center chief Dianne Bryant who moved to Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report) last year, CFO Stacy Smith who retired, former president Renee James who resigned in 2015 to set up her own company in competition with Intel, Justin Rattner, Dadi Perlmutter and Kirk Skaugen. But he also brought in Robert Swan as CFO, who is now operating as interim CEO.  Second, Intel lost its process lead during his tenure because of issues in moving to 10nm. The smaller process node would have enabled Intel to continue producing smaller and faster chips, as it has forever done in the past. But Intel has given up that lead to TSMC with Globalfoundries and Samsung likely to follow suit. This is perhaps the biggest disappointment, because it significantly skews competitive dynamics.   Third, Intel is seeing ever increasing competitive pressure from Advanced Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report) in both the data center and consumer (especially DIY) segments; from NVIDIA (NVDA  -  Free Report) in HPC, artificial intelligence, machine learning and autonomous driving technology; and even Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report) has started nipping at its heels. To perhaps make matters worse, cloud customers like Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), Alphabet, Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) and Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) are both testing competitors’ offerings and developing their own capabilities.This just isn’t the market that it used to be. To be fair, Intel hasn’t been napping, but has gradually expanded its served market to include not just CPUs but also FPGAs and memory to address the changing opportunities in the data center, PCs, 5G, IoT, autonomous vehicles, etc. It has also recently announced that it intends to have a GPU offering by 2020 (while the required talent is in place, whether it meets the timeline and is able to compete with AMD or NVIDIA at that time is of course unknown).Fourth, Intel has made a number of acquisitions over the past few years, some of the most significant of which were Altera, Nervana, Movidius and Mobileye. While that’s a lot to integrate and assimilate, the acquisitions have opened up new opportunities for Intel.Fifth, through all the uncertainties, Intel has grown revenue by an additional $15 billion and EPS by around 100% during his tenure. That was largely possible because the PC business continued to grow despite PCs themselves declining while the data center business also grew because of strong market drivers and the company’s leadership position. Intel’s share price has appreciated over 120%. Sixth, Krzanich has been a champion of women’s rights and diversity, allotting $300 million a year to induce it within the company and tying it up with executive compensation to speed up the process. This has set it apart from several other technology companies that haven’t been as forthcoming, for whatever reason.But he’s likely to be hard to replace.Intel historically elevates people to leadership positions with the goal of maintaining continuity in company culture, but there’s very little choice left internally. So one option would be Murthy Renduchintala who joined the company some years back. Another would be Navin Shenoy, who has worked himself up the ranks. Or it could also be Aicha Evans, Intel's chief strategy officer or even Bob Swan.Expert opinion is however in favor of fresh blood because of the new perspective that it is likely to bring and the fact that an outsider could perhaps be more realistic about Intel’s strengths, prospects and weaknesses and the need to trim some ambitions if required or spend more on certain other endeavors.These outsiders could be some of the people that left Intel in the last few years or Sanjay Jha who left Globalfoundries in March, or Pat Gelsinger (Intel’s first CTO) who now runs VMware, or a host of other people. The search for a new CEO is on they say.ConclusionIntel has taken a lot of measures to reposition the company for the new era and it is in the middle of bringing these plans to fruition. Whoever fills the leadership role will have his work cut out: deliver on somebody else’s plans with the world looking over your shoulder. All I can say is good luck!Intel shares carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2296,QCOM,"In the last five trading days, telecom stocks declined initially and traded flat thereafter only to decline further as concerns related to the U.S-China trade war resumed in a dramatic turn of events.Last week, President Trump revealed that the U.S. administration reached a settlement on ZTE as part of the ongoing trade talks between the two warring countries. This included a fine of $1.3 billion against ZTE, restructuring of its management and hiring of American compliance officers at the company. In return, the Commerce Department lifted the seven-year ban on the Chinese firm related to the purchase of components from U.S. manufacturers that threatened its survival and crippled operations.Just when it appeared that things were working toward reducing the United States’ negative balance of trade against China, President Donald Trump flip-flopped on his trade policy and renewed threats to impose 25% tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods to retaliate against unfair trade practices. Some industry observers believe that the tactic is part of Trump’s broader plan to gain leverage in the trade talks as Commerce department secretary Wilbur Ross is scheduled to visit China later this week. However, the volte-face could derail the trade negotiations as China vouched to counter the move with similar restrictions.  Regarding company-specific news, improved product launches for superior connectivity and high-quality content to subscribers at lower cost of ownership, and technology collaborations ruled the roost over the last five trading days.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    CenturyLink, Inc.

2297,QCOM,"The fourth-quarter earnings season has taken center stage, with 251 S&P 500 members having reported their numbers already. The season has turned out to be favorable so far, especially on the revenue front. A sturdy revenue momentum was witnessed in the season, above-average proportion of positive surprises along with favorable revisions trend for the present and the upcoming quarters.Per the latest Earnings Preview, total earnings for the companies are up 16% year over year on 10.5% higher revenues. Of the total, 80.5% beat earnings and 78.1% surpassed revenue estimates. With 92 S&P 500 members lined up to release their quarterly results this week, we are bullish on the equity market, which is gradually demonstrating a sequential improvement.Per the Zacks Industry classification, the telecommunications industry is grouped under the Computer and Technology sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors). For fourth-quarter 2017, the expected earnings growth rate for the sector is 21.9% on 10.5% revenue improvement.Telcos Bounce BackStocks in the telecommunication space has revived after a dismal run in 2017 due to headwinds like intense competition in the wireless market and competitive threat from online streaming service providers.The new tax law (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act) is a huge positive for the companies in this space. Notably, the $1.5-trillion tax overhaul package signed into law by President Trump on Dec 22, 2017, reduces corporate taxes from 35% to 21%. This has brought the corporate tax rate at its historic low in 78 years. Large telecom operators book much of their revenues in the homeland. Therefore, a significant reduction in corporate tax rate faced by telecom carriers will be immediately accretive to cash flow.Buoyed by the new law, various sector participants like AT&T (T  -  Free Report) and Comcast (CMCSA  -  Free Report) have declared bonuses for their employees.Outperformances in Q4Key players like AT&T and Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report) have reported impressive financial results in the quarter on the back of optimism surrounding the telecom industry. While AT&T reported fourth-quarter 2017 financial results, Qualcomm released first-quarter fiscal 2018 numbers.Sprint posted better-than-expected third-quarter fiscal 2017 financial results. After adjusting a one-time tax gain, net loss of 2 cents per share was narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 4 cents.Verizon Communications (VZ  -  Free Report) reported mixed fourth-quarter 2017 financial numbers. The top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate and the bottom line lagged the same.Notably, AT&T, Sprint and Verizon have reported massive postpaid wireless subscriber additions in the quarter.What Lies Ahead?Investors interested in the telecommunication space keenly await reports from other participants like T-Mobile US (TMUS  -  Free Report), Ubiquiti Networks, Inc.(UBNT  -  Free Report) and ViaSat Inc. .According to our quantitative model, a stock needs to have the right combination of the two key ingredients, a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better, to deliver an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.We also caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Let’s take a look at the aforementioned three telecom stocks slated to release their respective quarterly reports on Feb 8.T-Mobile US T-Mobile US is scheduled to release fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 08, before the market opens.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $10.89 billion, reflects year over year improvement of 6.98%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is at 37 cents per share, showing a year-over-year decline of 17.78%.The company is expected to deliver solid performance in the quarter on the back of solid subscriber statistics and share repurchase programs.Additionally, the company’s rating was upgraded to Ba2 by Moody's, with its rating outlook being confirmed stable. Per the Zacks Consensus Estimates, T-Mobile US is likely to see an improvement in revenues. (Read More: T-Mobile US to Report Q4 Earnings: What's in Store?)Notably, the company’s innovative network expansion methodologies and improvement plans, stellar network performance, deployment of LTE-U technology and offering of attractive unlimited data are key factors behind the mounting performance. This is supported by improving scale, healthy free cash flow generation, strong liquidity and valuable spectrum assets that also provide credit support.Additionally, the wireless national carrier displays an impressive earnings surprise history. The company’s bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the previous four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 53.97%.However, T-Mobile US has an Earnings ESP of -6.73%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is at 34 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 37 cents.T-Mobile US has a Zacks Rank #3 which increases the predictive power of ESP.

2298,QCOM,"Shares of Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report) declined 6.18% to $61.88 on Feb 5.The decline was led by Qualcomm’s apprehensions of losing share in the chipset market and various license disputes.Let’s take a look at each of the aforementioned factors.Will Qualcomm Lose Chipset Market Dominance?Tech giant Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) is reportedly looking for alternative chipset suppliers for its next-generation iPhones. Apple might choose Intel for its comparatively less-expensive modem chips. Notably, a shift to Intel will help Apple save around $105 million. This will help Apple reduce production costs for the next-generation iPhones, which will lower retail price.Additionally, Qualcomm is engaged in an ongoing year-long $1-billion lawsuit related to licensing royalty payments with Apple. The dispute continues to get bitter with multiple counter moves from the companies. Also, Apple is one of the major buyers of Qualcomm’s chipsets. To this end, Qualcomm CDMA Technologies (“QCT”) segment accounts for more than 70% of total revenues. The segment reports operating results for chipset sales and system software for wireless voice and data communications. This segment accounted for 76.65% of total revenues in first-quarter fiscal 2018. Qualcomm will face a major loss if Apple discards its chipsets.Meanwhile, Broadcom Limited (AVGO  -  Free Report), which is planning to acquire Qualcomm, is likely to face the risk of being left out of Apple’s ecosystem. Apple is expected to shift from Broadcom to Qorvo or STMicroelectronics, to opt for high-frequency filtering technology or wireless charging in its 12th-generation handsets.We believe that Apple is moving from 'best available' to 'good enough' to maintain standard iPhone functionality.Product Licensee DisputesQualcomm’s first-quarter fiscal 2018 and fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 GAAP and Non-GAAP results were affected by the dispute with Apple and its contract manufacturers as well as the previously disclosed dispute with another licensee. In first-quarter fiscal 2018, Qualcomm Technology Licensing (“QTL”) segment generated revenues of $1,299 million, down 28% year over year. EBT margin was 68% compared with 85% in the prior-year quarter. The aforementioned factors have led to the disappointing performance of the QTL segment. The first quarter of fiscal 2018 GAAP results include $6.0 billion charge or $4.03 per share, related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Legislation) in the United States and $1.2 billion charge or 76 cents imposed by the European Commission (EC). Qualcomm’s licensees are likely to take such actions until the disputes are resolved.Zacks Rank & Price Performance On Feb 6, Qualcomm has been downgraded to a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) from Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Moreover, Qualcomm has been portraying a disappointing price performance in the past three months. The company’s shares have declined 3.7% against the industry’s rally of 0.3%. When compared with the market at large, the stock compares unfavorably with the S&P 500 index’s rally of 2.3%. Our TakeQualcomm’s diverse product portfolio in the semiconductor business instills optimism. Qualcomm is one of the largest manufacturer of wireless chipset based on baseband technology. The company has been striving to retain its leadership in 5G, chipset market and mobile connectivity with multiple technological achievements and launches. Qualcomm, Verizon and Ericsson jointly completed the first Massive MIMO (Multiple Input-Multiple Output) trial with a fully-compatible customer device. Qualcomm achieved a 5G data connection with the Snapdragon X50 5G modem chipset on 28GHz mmWave spectrum. Additionally, Qualcomm is teaming with Verizon and Novatel Wireless for 5G NR mmWave technology trial. Notably, Qualcomm Technologies has been at the forefront of driving Gigabit LTE and 5G in the industry.Recently, Qualcomm received regulatory nod from South Korea’s Fair Trade Commission and European Commission for the pending NXP Semiconductors (NXPI  -  Free Report) buyout. China is yet to approve the deal.Despite the ongoing lawsuit, it is unlikely that Qualcomm will be completely out of Apple's ecosystem. This is because the company’s 5G technologies are likely to surpass Intel's, which will put Qualcomm in a competitive position. More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions. Apple sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years, creating a $1.7 trillion market.Zacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this fast-emerging phenomenon and 6 tickers for taking advantage of it.

2299,QCOM,"Monday continued the losses seen last Friday, as the Dow Jones plunged 4.6%, or over 1,100 points, to sit at 24,345.75, and the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq fell 4.1% and 3.7%, respectively. The Dow was down 1,500 points at one point during late-afternoon trading, and today marks the worst single-day point drop ever for the widely-watched index.The VIX, an index which many investors look to in order to gauge market volatility, reached an astounding 35.02, up over 100%, at market close. This marks the largest one-day percentage increase ever for the index.Fingers are pointing to a few things for this latest market decline. On Friday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics released strong wage data, with unemployment remaining steady at 4.1% and 200,000 new jobs created last month. However, this good news had markets bracing for a potentially aggressive hike in interest rates from the Federal Reserve in the next year.Additionally, the 10-year Treasury yield to hit a four-year high on Friday to 2.85% after it fell to a record low just 18 months ago. Today, the 10-year closed near 2.73%Overall, it looks like the major indexes have hit the restart button on 2018 after a hot start. The S&P 500, in particular, is now down about flat on the year after reaching an all-time high last month, erasing all of its gains and breaking below its 50-day moving average.Earlier in the day, after opening in the red, the market managed to gain back some of its losses and settle back into green territory, but that was only for a brief moment.Some of the biggest stock movers in the Dow included oil giants ExxonMobil (XOM  -  Free Report) and Chevron (CVX  -  Free Report), which ended the day down 5.7% and about 5%. Top decliners in the S&P 500 included Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) and Arconic (ARNC  -  Free Report).The tech-heavy Nasdaq, an index which has still managed to keep some gains this year thanks to a great January, saw companies like NVIDIA (NVDA  -  Free Report), Vodafone (VOD  -  Free Report), and Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report) slip 8.49%, 6.25%, and 6.57%, respectively, at market close.Today’s dramatic stock market activity even caught the attention of the White House, and in a statement, the Trump administration said that “We’re always concerned when the market loses any value, but we’re also confident in the economy’s fundamentals.”Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - Q1 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over.

2300,QCOM,"All the three key indexes started the day strongly after in-line consumer-inflation data subdued rate hike fears. However, benchmarks finished in negative territory on Tuesday after Trump administration dismissed U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Additionally, Trump ordered Broadcom to abandon the planned takeover of Qualcomm, following which shares of Qualcomm declined and weighed on the broader markets.How the Benchmarks Fared?The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) decreased 0.6%, or 156.64 points, to close at 25,178.61. The S&P 500 fell 0.1% to close at 2,783.02. However, the tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 7,588.33, gaining 0.4%. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) increased 7% to close at 15.67. A total of 6.52 billion shares were traded on Monday, lower than the last 20-session average of 7.2 billion shares. Advancers outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 1.22-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 1.45-to-1 ratio favored advancing issues.Tillerson Replaced With CIA Director PompeoOn Tuesday, President Trump ousted Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, the former CEO of Exxon Mobil Inc. (XOM), from his position. Tillerson will be replaced with CIA Director Mike Pompeo, while Pompeo’s position will be taken over by Gina Haspel, CIA’s deputy director. Haspel will become the first woman director of the CIA. Tillerson’s ouster had a broad-based negative impact on key indexes with the Dow registering a decline of more than 170 points, while the Nasdaq ended its seven day long streak of gains.Meanwhile, the Labor Department reported that Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased 0.2% in February, in line with the consensus estimate. This figure was lower than January’s increase of 0.5%. Core CPI, which excludes food and energy prices, gained 0.2% last month, also in line with the consensus estimate of 0.2%. Core CPI’s gain was less than January’s increase of 0.3%.Although, an increase in the key rate seems certain this month, in line consumer inflation data reduced concerns over the pace of Fed rate hikes this year. Following this development, the Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF) declined 1.1%, becoming the second worst performing sector among the S&P 500. Dow components from this sector, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report) and The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS  -  Free Report) fell 1.2% and 1.8%, respectively.Broadcom Biggest Laggard In The S&P 500Shares of QUALCOMM Incorporated (QCOM  -  Free Report) slumped 5% after the White House issued a statement saying that the “proposed takeover” of QUALCOMM by Broadcom Inc. (AVGO  -  Free Report) “is prohibited.” Citing concerns over national security signed an Executive Order late on Monday, President Trump ordered both the companies to ""immediately and permanently abandon the proposed takeover.""Broadcom was the worst performing stock among both the S&P 500 and the Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK). The sector fell 1.2% with two of its key holdings, Microsoft Corporation (MSFT  -  Free Report), Facebook, Inc. (FB  -  Free Report) and Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL  -  Free Report) increasing 2.4%, 1.6% and 2.2%, respectively. Alphabet has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2302,QCOM,"BlackBerry Limited (BB  -  Free Report) is slated to release fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Mar 28, before the market opens.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 400%. Its earnings per share (excluding 55 cents from non-recurring items) of 3 cents compared favorably with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of a penny. Moreover, the bottom line improved 50% year over year. Results were boosted by robust software sales while total adjusted revenues came in at $235 million. The consensus mark for the metric was pegged at $216 million.Let’s see how things shape up for this announcement.Factors Likely at PlayThe unfavorable verdict in the Nokia case is likely to hurt results in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. Notably, last December, BlackBerry had to shell out $137 million to Nokia as a result of losing a payment dispute with it. These charges might further hamper the company’s bottom line.Moreover, on the conference call of the fiscal third quarter, BlackBerry stated that operating expenses are likely to rise in the quarter to be reported than what was incurred in the previous quarter. Increased investments in sales and marketing have led to this forecast. High operating expenses will also affect the bottom line in the period.Additionally, BlackBerry faces the risk of adverse foreign exchange fluctuations with escalated global exposure. This apart, high-debt levels might hit results in the fiscal fourth quarter.However, robust software sales and growth of cybersecurity business are expected to aid the company’s results.The company’s multiple deals in the recent past also raise optimism about the stock. Notably, its automotive deals with Baidu Inc. (BIDU  -  Free Report) and Qualcomm Technologies, Inc., a subsidiary of Qualcomm Incorporated (QCOM  -  Free Report) are anticipated to boost results.The company’s partnership with Baidu is aimed at expediting the deployment of connected and autonomous vehicle technology for automotive OEMs and suppliers across the world.

2303,QCOM,"President Donald Trump is likely to impose tariffs on China by this weekend. Information technology, telecommunications and consumer electronics are the major Chinese industries that are expected to bear the brunt of U.S. tariffs.Notably, the implementation of these tariffs stems from the Trump administration’s concern that manufacturing by Chinese companies for these sectors is leaving the intellectual property of the American companies vulnerable to theft.Consequently, U.S. companies that rely on Chinese imports are unhappy about the move as it will raise prices of telecom equipment and several electronics products for the IT sector. However, a hike in product prices will certainly help U.S. wireless equipment manufacturers.Further, this move highlights the Trump administration’s aggressive efforts to safeguard next-generation innovative products of these blue-collar industries of the country. That is why investment in some of these stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank should prove to be lucrative.National Security Concerns Dominate Telecom Space Trump administration is deeply concerned about China’s drive to unseat United States as the primary developer and supplier of state-of-the-art products in the fields of high-tech artificial intelligence, semiconductors, quantum computing and various other digital technology driven sectors.Notably, most of the big manufacturers of these products are fully patronized by the Chinese government. These companies have become serious threat to the U.S. economic and military supremacy.  China runs a massive $375 billion trade surplus against United States.On Mar 12, Trump ordered to immediately prohibit the proposed $117 billion takeover bid of Singapore-based Broadcom (AVGO  -  Free Report) for Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report), U.S. chipset giant and a global leader for setting wireless standards.The government argued that third party entities, especially, the Chinese tech giants like Huawei and ZTE may get access to Qualcomm’s precious patents from Broadcom or at least a stalled R&D activity may result in Qualcomm losing its competitive edge in the upcoming 5G wireless network standard to its Chinese counterparts. (Read More: Is the Broadcom-Qualcomm Deal in Jeopardy? Winners & Losers)In recent months, the U.S. Treasury's Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) has blocked takeover deals of U.S. companies MoneyGram International Inc. (MGI  -  Free Report) and Lattice Semiconductor Corp. (LSCC  -  Free Report) by Chinese counterparts. In fact, in January 2018, the security officials of Trump administration contemplated the prospect of the government building its own 5G network to combat China’s economic and cyber threat.Strong Domestic Wireless Infrastructure MarketA growing U.S. economy speeds up the demand for real-time voice, data, and video manifold. The escalation in demand has encouraged telecom service providers to undertake large network extensions while upgrading plans. This in turn has provided a boost to the demand for telecom infrastructure developers, particularly wireless gear manufacturers.On Dec 21, SNS Research reported that the wireless network infrastructure industry is expected to grow at a rate of 2% over the next three years. Per projections, the market will witness an annual spending of $56 billion by 2020, up from $53 billion in 2017. Per the report, the next-generation 5G wireless network is anticipated to account for more than 40% of wireless infrastructure spending by the end of 2025.Our PicksTrump has given enough indication that his administration will take special interest in the functioning of the telecom industry. The safeguarding of the highly valuable patents of the American tech heavy companies from the Chinese dragon is of foremost importance to the American eagle.At this stage, investors will be better off to investing in U.S. wireless equipment manufacturing companies, which are expected to benefit the most from upcoming U.S. tariffs on China. At this stage, we have narrowed down our search to the following stocks with favourable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) with strong growth potential.Chart below shows the performance our five picks in the last three months. NETGEAR Inc.

2304,QCOM,"Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) remains the leading player in the wearables market, courtesy of Apple Watch.According to recently released Canalys data, shipments of wearables grew 35% in the first quarter of 2018. Apple’s shipments were the highest at 3.8 million, driven by Watch Series 3 and the addition of LTE.Chinese company, Xiaomi came second, selling 3.7 million units of wearable devices. Mi Band devices accounted for 90% of total shipments.Both Apple and Xiaomi held 18% market share in the quarter. The other three in the top five list, having a mixed portfolio of fitness wearables, were Fitbit (FIT  -  Free Report), Garmin (GRMN  -  Free Report) and Huawei with market share of 11%, 7%, and 6%, respectively.Apple Watch Grabs the Lion’s SharePer the report, smartwatches generated 80% of wearable band revenues with 43% of shipments. Basic bands, representing 57% share of shipments, contributed only 20% to revenues.Notably, Apple represented 59% of sales in cellular-enabled smartwatch market, the firm adds. Garmin came second with 1 million units of smartwatches sold in the last quarter. Fitbit’s wearable band shipments consisted 24% of smartwatches.In terms of revenues, Apple is the clear winner, given the higher priced smartwatches it sells. However, competition in the space is expected to intensify if Alphabet’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) Google comes up with a similar offering, which is currently lacking in the Android ecosystem, adds Canalys senior analyst, Jason Low.Per IDC’s latest estimates, the overall wearables market is expected to witness CAGR of 18.4% to reach 222.3 million in 2021 from 113.2 million shipments in 2017. The firm expects Apple Watch to lead the smart watch category, which is expected to witness CAGR of 22.7% from 2017-2021.More Room for GrowthApple Watch revenues showed double digit year-over-year growth in the last reported quarter. Unit sales of Watch also reached a new high in the fiscal second quarter. On the conference call, CEO Tim Cook added that the company’s wearables business is almost the size of a Fortune 300 company.Apple Watch’s popularity is also growing among teenagers, which is evident from the recently released Piper Jaffray’s Taking Stock with Teens survey.Per the survey, Apple Watch is the most preferred smartwatch among teens. Reportedly, out of the 20% respondents who own a smartwatch, 15% own the device, up from 12% in the fall 2017 survey. Samsung Gear stands second with merely 2% of the respondents owning the watch.Apple will reportedly launch Watch Series 4 in the third quarter of 2018, per KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. The new generation of the Apple Watch is speculated to have a 15% larger display, trendy design, enhanced sensors for health monitoring beyond heart rate and longer battery life. Moreover, a drop in prices of older versions is also anticipated.Per KGI estimates, about 22-24 million units of Apple Watch will be sold in 2018, which indicates year-over-year growth of nearly 30%. Kuo projects Watch sales to reach 50 million units a year in the long term.Apple Inc. Revenue (TTM) Apple Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Apple Inc.

Per Pankaj Kedia, Qualcomm's senior director of Wearables, the new smartwatch chip “will significantly change the Wear OS ecosystem.”Moreover, the reason behind Google’s rebranding of Android Wear title to Wear OS in March 2018 was to make people understand that the wearables operating system is for everyone and not just Android users.Per the company, one out of three Wear OS users is an owner of an iPhone. The company is therefore trying to lure iPhone users by making the features work seamlessly on the device.Alphabet Inc. Revenue (TTM) Alphabet Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Alphabet Inc.

2305,QCOM,"Qualcomm Incorporated (QCOM  -  Free Report) has introduced the industry’s first 5G NR (New Radio) solution for small cells and remote radio head deployments via its subsidiary Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. The announcement was made by the company at The Small Cells World Summit 2018 in London.Qualcomm Continues to Lead in the 5G MarketQualcomm has focused on solutions for small cells for a long time. The 5G NR solution is highly flexible and is designed to enable original equipment manufacturers to reuse both software and hardware designs across sub-6 GHz and millimeter wave products. This will enable operators to easily switch between low and high frequency spectrum bands. The solution is built on FSM100xx platform, which has a software-defined modem, enabling operators to upgrade it with 5G evolution. Also, the solution will work equally well both outdoors and indoors. This is of significance because the 5G signal on mmWave spectrum is known to have difficulty penetrating buildings.All four top U.S. operators are planning to launch 5G NR services in some markets or the other by 2019. Qualcomm stated that the new platform will be ready for sampling in 2019 and it is currently working with some customers to give them early mover advantage.Small Cells Potentially the Future of Core Mobile Network PlanningAccording to analysts at Mobile Experts, revenues from global small cell equipment sales are expected to reach $5.7 billion by 2023. The firm said that the major carriers are driving the demand as they focus on improving networks through the implementation of small cells.5G NR: What is it?5G NR is a new air interface developed for 5G. An air interface is the radio frequency part between the mobile device and the active base station. The active base station can change as the user constantly changes location. Primarily, the 5G NR is designed to improve the performance, flexibility, scalability and efficiency of current mobile networks, and to take optimal advantage of the available spectrum.Price Performance of QualcommIn the past three months, Qualcomm has persistently underperformed the industry. Over this period, the stock has lost 8.8% against growth of 0.6% for the industry. The performance was primarily affected by the ongoing dispute with Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) and its contract manufacturers (Qualcomm licensees), as well as the previously disclosed dispute with another licensee. Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderQualcomm currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the industry space are BlackBerry Limited (BB  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and Motorola Solutions, Inc. (MSI  -  Free Report) carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

2306,QCOM,"Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report) had an eventful week with its I/O developers’ conference, a positive White House meeting, a decision to ban Irish referendum ads and Waymo projections from UBS. Here are the high points-Google I/O-Revamping news: Google is finally doing something it should have done a long time ago. Other than improving the news app by adding content from YouTube and tweets, it is introducing different ways of displaying news that will help users gain deeper insight into any issue.The downside of personalization is that your own views tend to get reinforced while the other side of the story escapes your attention. This naturally affects your understanding of any issue. So now, there are two options titled “Full Coverage” (is same for all readers and will feature different points of view) and “Headlines” (will also showcase what people are reading all over the world) that give you unfiltered news stories. You also have the option of training the AI to feature your preferred publishers.-Assistant: Google announced Routines some time back that lets Assistant in Google Home take over routine functions (“actions”) when it hears word triggers. ""Hey Google, good night"" for example could get Assistant to turn off the lights, adjust the temperature, play music or do other things you require it to. Now Google is bringing Custom Routines, so you can also determine your own trigger words and fix your routine from any of a million actions.  These actions are important things, because it is a list of to-do things for Assistant, but also includes apps that you may like to engage with (like a voice version of app-install ads). What’s more, if you decide to keep using an app (for example a music streaming app), you have the option of setting it up to send you notifications. This is a feature that Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) already has so it’s a good-to-have thing on Google as well.All this is meant to make your life easier while keeping you from using your phone less. So assuming that you actually use your devices to do all these things, now you can simply shout out a single command and sit back.Assistant can also help you write emails by suggesting words or phrases as you write and taking care of details. It can manage your photos and suggest who to share stuff with and also turn your black and white images to color.-Google Duplex is basically Assistant taking over the phone calling function to book appointments with the hair dresser or a restaurant table (for example). It’s human-like, using the language and making all the sounds that a person usually makes during conversation, so the person on the other side likely won’t know they are talking to a robot. This also makes it controversial.But according to Google engineers Yaniv Leviathan and Yossi Matias, ""Duplex can only carry out natural conversations after being deeply trained in such domains. It cannot carry out general conversations."" So there could be a simple way of checking out if the entity you’re talking to is really a person.The Google Assistant could of course introduce itself as such before handling the situation, but then there’s the chance that the person on the other end might hang up rather than talk to a robot. But it is a very interesting development, particularly if you consider that Assistant can constantly expand its domain experience to other spheres such as the phone company, store, servicemen, school representatives and other people you might need to talk to. It would be a really nice way of handling the tasks you don’t particularly like.-AI Chips: Google launched the third generation of its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) that the company claims packs eight times the power of the second generation chips announced last year. The chips will enable AI by allowing applications to do things like recognize words specific people say within audio recordings, spot objects in photos and videos, and pick up underlying emotions in written text. The new TPUs won’t be available to third parties just yet, but may be offered to its cloud customers later.-Security: Google is guaranteeing that its just-announced IoT platform called Android Things will take care of security updates for connected IoT devices built on Things for at least three years, which while not covering the useful lives of everyday devices like connected thermostats, cameras and speakers, is a nice start.Also, since the maximum period hasn’t been announced, it may actually be in line with what the competition from companies like Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), Amazon or Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) offers. Things is built on chips from companies like Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report) and a stripped down version of Android that companies can incorporate into their devices.Early products built on the platform include the Lenovo smart display launched at CES and the LG smart speaker that went on sale last month. Nest thermostats still aren’t part of this family, which could be why Google recently brought the division into its fold.-Android P will also tell users how much time they’re spending on the device, offer app timers to set limits as well as different modes that can help the user get away such as a ‘do not disturb” mode or wind down mode (reduces brightness). -Maps is getting an AR upgrade with a new Visual Positioning System. So when users raise their phones they see and actual image of the street and a large arrow pointing them in the correct direction (particularly useful when traveling on foot). They will also get many more pointers about nearby businesses.White House Gives AI Vote of ConfidenceIn a first-of-its-kind meeting between the government and representatives of over 40 U.S. companies across technology, food, agriculture, energy, manufacturing, financial services, healthcare, transportation, logistics and other sectors, the White house said that the companies would have the greatest possible latitude to develop artificial intelligence (AI).The government’s goal is to maintain America’s AI lead in the face of the determined challenge from China. So it doesn’t look like there will be regulations pulling back AI efforts any time in the near term, which makes sense because it’s very early days yet and the impact of the technology on the environment, jobs, privacy and security isn’t known yet.According to a Bloomberg account, Michael Kratsios, a top White House science adviser, said, ""We didn’t cut the lines before Alexander Graham Bell made the first telephone call… We didn’t regulate flight before the Wright Brothers took off at Kitty Hawk.""These are encouraging statements for the future of AI and could signal the start of a partnership with the private sector that could include government funding and easier access to data.  Google, Facebook Ban Election AdsGoogle and Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) are playing safe with respect to an Irish referendum on the Eighth Amendment, added to the constitution back in 1983. Accordingly, Facebook is blocking all referendum related ads originating in any other country while Google is blocking (including on YouTube) all ads related to the referendum.The law in question determines that as an expression of respect to the child’s right to life, abortion is an option for women only when their own life is in danger and for no other reason, not even in the case of rape or incest. The punishment for breaking the law of up to 14 years in prison is also severe. But opinions have changed over time, which is why the Irish are seeking to liberalize this law and give women more choice.Although there’s no restriction on people discussing both sides of the issue on social media and placing ads on Facebook from within the country, groups supporting the anti-abortion law are saying that it’s “an attempt to rig the referendum” by “preventing the public from hearing the message from one side.""UBS Note on WaymoWaymo is expected to start offering its self-driving taxi service in Phoenix, Arizona later this year and UBS has put out a note on its prospects, as well as the state of the market over the next few years. The investment firm doesn’t expect these taxis to really take off until 2026, but by 2030, it estimates that there will be 26 million self-driving taxis on the roads.Not just that – it says that Waymo will take 60% of the global market that will generate up to $2.8 trillion by 2030, when its technology will be so effective that automakers will be forced to buy it. RecommendationsAlphabet has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2307,QCOM,"A successful investor understands the importance of retaining well-performing stocks in the portfolio at the right time. Indicators of a stock's bullish run include a rise in share price and strong fundamentals. Though there may be some concerns regarding the stock but they are transitory in nature.Broadcom Limited (AVGO  -  Free Report) is one such technology stock that has been on healthy growth trajectory, post first-quarter 2018 earnings.

The figure improved 41% from the year-ago quarter and 11.5% sequentially.Non-GAAP revenues from continuing operations were $5.33 billion, which increased 28% from the year-ago quarter and 10% on a sequential basis. The figure was slightly higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.25 billion.Encouraging ViewFor second-quarter fiscal 2018, Broadcom forecasts non-GAAP revenues of almost $5 billion (+/- $75 million).The company projects growth to be driven by increasing traction of 10G technology to support broadband video delivery. Further, the company expects an increase in demand for networking products from cloud and data centers, as well and broadband access products, to positively impact Wired Infrastructure revenues.Management stated that Enterprise Storage segment results in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 will benefit from Purley product cycle, robust demand from enterprise and data centers and recovery in HDD demand. The segment will also include Brocade Fiber Channel SAN business that is expected to generate a partial-quarter revenue contribution.The company expects double-digit sequential growth in industrial product revenues and projects growth in resale.Broadcom believes that the storage business will benefit from strong adoption of All-Flash arrays in storage appliances infrastructure that uses the company’s PCI Express and NVMe technology.Industrial shipments and resale are likely to grow, which will drive segmental revenues in the second quarter. For the rest of 2018, strong adoption and ramp up of the company’s optical isolation product will continue to drive growth for electric vehicles.Positive Earnings Surprise HistoryBroadcom has an impressive earnings surprise history. The company outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, recording a positive average earnings surprise of 3.79%.Further, it has a long-term expected EPS growth rate of 13.75%.Upward Estimate RevisionsOver the last 60 days, fiscal 2018 estimates were revised upward, taking the Zacks Consensus Estimate up from $19.49 to $19.76 per share.Other Growth DriversEarly in the first quarter, Broadcom completed the long-delayed Brocade acquisition. It completed the divestiture of Brocade's campus WiFi and switch business to Arris for $800 million in cash.

The addition of Brocade will help the company further penetrate the FC SAN market and garner competitive prowess in the long run.The company is benefiting from strong demand of its wireless solutions and expanding product portfolio, which makes it well-positioned to address the needs of rapidly growing technologies like IoT and 5G. The company also has strong ties with leading OEMs across multiple target markets that will aid it to gain key insights into the requirements of customers. Moreover, the upcoming launch of the next generation WiFi products is expected to be a catalyst for the segment.Risk PersistsCustomer concentration, intensifying competition, integration risks due to frequent acquisitions and leverage balance sheet are key headwinds. Further, President Trump recently released an order, asking Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report) to immediately and permanently abandon its proposed takeover by Broadcom on grounds of national security concerns. This doesn't bode well for the company.Zacks Rank & Key PicksCurrently, Broadcom carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A couple of better-ranked stocks in the technology sector are NVIDIA Corp.

The decline was primarily due to seasonal weakness in demand for broadband access and set-top box products.Broadcom stated that a slowdown in demand for optical products from access and metro networks hurt the top line. However, demand for data centers and cloud shipments were strong in the quarter.Wireless Communications (41% of total revenues) were up 88% year over year and 23% quarter over quarter to roughly $2.21 billion.

2310,QCOM,"The telecom industry had a stellar run on the bourse last week as most of the key stocks traded in the green.On the earnings front, U.S. telecom behemoth AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report) reported strong financial numbers in the fourth quarter of 2017 with both the top and the bottom line beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company reported 4.1 million total wireless net adds, with 2.7 million in the U.S. (this was driven by connected devices, postpaid phones and prepaid) and 1.3 million in Mexico.

(QCOM  -  Free Report), the largest mobile chipset manufacturer worldwide, reported impressive financial results for first-quarter fiscal 2018 (ended Dec 24, 2017), with both the top and the bottom line beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. During the quarter, the company shipped approximately 237 million CDMA-based MSM (Mobile Station Modem) chipsets, up 9% year over year.Moreover, Qualcomm signed a memorandum of understanding with four leading Chinese handset developers for a multi-year sale of RF Front-End solutions. The value of the deal is more than $2 billion. However, the company also received a bad news. The EC (European Commission), the regulatory authority of the European Union, has slapped a fine of €997 million (approximately $1.24 billion) on Qualcomm over anticompetitive practices related to mobile chipset sale.The EC claims that an iPhone/iPad modem exclusivity deal between Qualcomm and Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report), which lasted from 2011 till the end of 2016, amounted to anti-competitive behavior. Qualcomm abused its dominant market position for 4G LTE chipset and payed significantly to Apple to secure modem exclusivity.Only a week ago, in a major relief to Qualcomm, the EC gave its nod to the company for the acquisition of NXP Semiconductors NV (NXPI  -  Free Report) with some restrictive conditions. Meanwhile, the company is facing a hostile takeover bid from Broadcom Ltd. (AVGO  -  Free Report) of a massive $130 billion.Canadian telecom giant Rogers Communications Inc.

Consequently, wireless carriers like AT&T, Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report) and other market incumbents are planning to centralize their 5G-related operations in millimeter wave bands.

Additionally, upbeat fourth-quarter earnings season, which include a very strong revenue momentum, an above-average proportion of positive surprises and an unusually positive revisions trend for the current and coming quarters, also contributed to strong market performance.Stocks That Made HeadlinesQualcomm Beats Q1 Earnings and Revenue EstimatesQualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report) reported strong financial results for first-quarter fiscal 2018, with the top and the bottom lines beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate.

2315,QCOM,"Over the last five trading days, though telecom stocks initially witnessed a steep rise as U.S.-China trade concerns abated, concerns over the implications of Senate’s approval to retain net neutrality played spoilsport.Last week, President Trump made a sudden turnabout by acknowledging in a Twitter post that he was working with the Chinese President Xi Jinping to give ZTE “a way to get back into business, fast”, after its operations crippled following a seven-year ban on sale of various components for illegally shipping goods to Iran. Industry experts believed that the strategic move by one of the most vocal supporters of national security and job protectionism was probably aimed at gaining much in return as various U.S. firms depended on China for their survival. They opined that ZTE was perhaps used as a pawn to seek favorable trade concessions like annulment of proposed tariffs on American agricultural exports and free access to the Chinese markets.As concerns across the global borders subsided, domestic issues came to the forefront when the U.S. Senate voted in favor of reversing the FCC decision in December to repeal landmark 2015 net neutrality rules by a margin of 52 to 47. This offered a level playing field for all Internet providers to ensure free and open Internet to all users and provide equal access to Web content by barring broadband service providers from favoring any particular content. However, uncertainty remains over whether the U.S. House of Representatives will at all vote on the issue as the White House is reportedly opposed to repealing the December FCC order.Regarding company-specific news, earnings of some telecom companies along with push for increased coverage for 5G technology topped the charts. The industry’s earnings in general were on strong footing backed by healthy growth dynamics thanks to the existing secular trends in cloud computing, artificial intelligence and Big Data.  Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    CenturyLink, Inc.

The top line grew 14.6% on a year-over-year basis.

2318,QCOM,"The fourth-quarter earnings season is picking up pace, with multiple companies reporting earnings each day. Per the latest Earnings Preview, approximately 400 companies, including 121 S&P 500 members, will report earnings this week. To date, 26% of the S&P 500 members have already reported results, with another 24% slated to release results this week.Generally, earnings releases are quite scattered this quarter. Moreover, the earnings calendar is not the same for all companies.Let’s take a look at two stocks — AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report) and Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM  -  Free Report) — which will release results on Jan 31, after market close. While, AT&T will report fourth-quarter 2017 results, Qualcomm is slated to release first-quarter fiscal 2018 numbers.Notably, the companies are grouped under the Computer and Technology sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors).Here, we discuss the price performance and fundamentals (financial and non-financial) of the companies to gain an idea about how they will fare this earnings season.We rely on our Zacks methodology to help investors choose the better stock. Our quantitative model states that a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better to deliver earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Meanwhile, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Let’s take a closer look at each of the aforementioned factors.Price Performance We have compared the price performances of AT&T and Qualcomm with the broader sector and the S&P 500 index for the October-December 2017 period.Shares of Qualcomm returned 23.5% outperforming the broader sector’s and S&P 500 index’s rally of 6.3% and 5.5%, respectively. However, AT&T’s shares declined 0.7% over the same time frame.  AT&TAT&T is one of the leading telecommunication service providers in the United States. The company’s wireless opportunities from the launch of standards-based mobile 5G services in 2018 and the FirstNet project look impressive. Meanwhile, its move to raise quarterly dividend by 2% to 50 cents per share (annualized $2.00 per share) is encouraging. In December 2017, AT&T’s over-the-top (OTT) online streaming service — DIRECTV NOW — reported more than 1 million subscribers, despite cord-cutting. The company reported a net gain of approximately 0.213 million DIRECTV NOW connections, since Sep 30, 2017. It is to be seen whether the company can maintain subscriber gain in the to-be-reported quarter.AT&T is expected to earn 65 cents per share on $41.2 billion in revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. The company has a mixed earnings surprise history. In two of the previous four quarters, the company’s bottom line met the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in one of the four, the average beat being 1.36%.However, AT&T has an Earnings ESP of -0.15%. This negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult despite the company’s favorable Zacks Rank #3. (Read more: What's in the Cards for AT&T This Earnings Season?)AT&T Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  AT&T Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | AT&T Inc. Quote QualcommQualcomm is one of the largest manufacturer of wireless chipset based on baseband technology. The company has been trying to retain its leadership in 5G, chipset market and mobile connectivity with multiple technological achievements and launches. On the flip side, the company has been involved in various legal brawls related to unfair business practices or licensing royalty payments.Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, Qualcomm is expected to earn 90 cents per share and $5.95 billion in revenues in the to-be-reported quarter. Segment-wise, revenues in Qualcomm Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) Technologies (QCT) are estimated at $4,648 million, up from $4,650 million and $4,101 million reported in fourth-quarter 2017 and first-quarter fiscal 2017, respectively. Qualcomm Technology Licensing (QTL) revenue estimate of $1,228 million is above $1,800 million and $1,811 million reported in fourth-quarter 2017 and first-quarter fiscal 2017, respectively.Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the company’s prospects in the to-be-reported quarter based on certain non-financial metrics look encouraging. Qualcomm is expected to ship approximately 230 million CDMA-based MSM (Mobile Station Modem) chipsets in the quarter, up from 220 million reported in the previous quarter. The estimate is in line with management’s previous chipset outlook of 220-240 million for first-quarter fiscal 2018.Qualcomm has a mixed earnings surprise history. In the trailing four quarters, the company’s earnings lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two and beat the same in the other two. The average positive surprise for the last four quarters is 6.31%.Moreover, the company has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s 0.00% ESP (both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 90 cents) makes surprise prediction difficult. (Read more: Qualcomm to Report Q1 Earnings: What's in Store?)QUALCOMM Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise  QUALCOMM Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | QUALCOMM Incorporated QuoteOur TakePer our proprietary model, AT&T and Qualcomm are unlikely to post earnings beat in the to-be-reported quarter. However, Qualcomm’s Earnings ESP of 0.00% lends it an edge over AT&T’s -0.15%.Irrespective of an earnings beat or miss, investors should focus on the companies’ fundamentals to take a  decision.

2319,QCOM,"In a dramatic turn of events, regulators of China have reportedly restarted the review process for the proposed merger of Qualcomm Incorporated (QCOM  -  Free Report) with NXP Semiconductors N.V. (NXPI  -  Free Report) that was long shelved. The strategic move is expected to ease the trade relationship between the United States and China that seemed to be on the boil due to various restrictions and counter restrictions imposed on each other.The top administration of China has asked its Ministry of Commerce officials to fast track the review process that was put on hold when domestic companies raised objections to the deal. They argued that the transaction was a potent threat to their survival as the combined entity would extend Qualcomm’s patent licensing business into areas like mobile payments and autonomous driving. The issue became a bone of contention between the two warring countries as China being the largest importer of semiconductors, was aggressively trying to end its dependence on the United States and gain an upper hand.The issue further spiraled into a full-fledged conflict when the U.S. government banned sale of components by American firms to Chinese telecom equipment maker, ZTE Corp. Citing a breach of an agreement inked last year, the U.S. Department of Commerce slapped a seven-year ban on sale of various components to ZTE after it was caught illegally shipping goods to Iran. This crippled the operations of ZTE and threatened its survival to such an extent that the Chinese officials were forced to make solemn representations to the visiting U.S. delegates to convey its plight. ZTE also formally appealed to the U.S. Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security to suspend the ban on its products.Although President Trump refused to budge initially, he made a sudden turnabout by acknowledging in a Twitter post that he was working with the Chinese President Xi Jinping to give ZTE “a way to get back into business, fast.” This perhaps tilted the scales in favor of Qualcomm and set the ball rolling to get the approval for its merger with NXP. The transaction, when complete, will position Qualcomm as a strong player in the next-generation mobile chipset segment with a potential market size of $138 billion by 2020.Qualcomm has underperformed the industry in the past three months with an average loss of 15.4% compared with a decline of 3.3% for the latter. Whether a core business focus can indeed help the company to turn the tables and improve its sagging shares remains to be seen.Qualcomm currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks in the industry include Motorola Solutions, Inc. (MSI  -  Free Report) and PCTEL, Inc. (PCTI  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.   Motorola has an expected long-term earnings growth rate of 8%.

2321,QCOM,"The world’s largest and the ultra-popular large cap ETF, SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY, has been enjoying its strong asset accumulation on the completion of its 25th anniversary. This is because it has become the first ETF with $300 billion in AUM. Though SPY’s inception date is Jan 22, 1993, it officially debuted on the American Stock Exchange on Jan 29, 1993 (read: Amazing ETF Strategies for Skyrocketing Markets).Inside The ETFSPY tracks the S&P 500 index and holds 505 stocks in its basket, with each security holding no more than 3.62%. This suggests a nice balance across each security and prevents heavy concentration.About one-fourth of the portfolio is tilted toward the information technology sector, which has fully emerged from the burst of the dot-com bubble and is flying higher in the current bullish market. Moreover, financials, health care, consumer discretionary and industrials, each of which accounts for a double-digit exposure, are also performing remarkably well.The ETF charges 9 bps in fees per year from investors and trades in heavy volume of 71.6 million shares a day on average. This ensures higher liquidity with a tight bid/ask spread, leading to lower trading costs for investors (see: all the Large Cap ETFs here).Factors Driving SPYThe U.S. stock market is in the midst of the second-longest bull run in history. Encouraging domestic and international fundamentals as well as better-than-expected corporate earnings are the major catalysts. This, coupled with Trump’s pro-growth agenda aimed at accelerating economic growth, reducing regulation, increasing spending, slashing taxes, and boosting jobs and corporate profits, are bolstering optimism in the economy.Since Trump’s win, the stock market rally has been the fourth largest since 1936, according to Goldman Sachs. Per Sam Stovall of CFRA Research, the S&P 500 rally during Trump’s first year is the third best since World War II, behind only President George H. W. Bush and President John F. Kennedy (read: Trump's First Year in Office: 5 Must-See ETF Charts).Further, a combination of other factors like rise in oil prices, a weak dollar and rounds of upbeat global economic data have bolstered the appetite for riskier assets in recent months. Good news flowing despite the global trade fears, political instability in Washington and geopolitical tension.As a result, SPY generated more than 545% returns over the past 25 years and has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold) with a Medium risk outlook. Though most of the stocks in the fund’s portfolio have delivered astounding returns during this time period, a few were the real stars.

At present, the fund has about $632.0 million in assets.On the other hand, SOXX lost about $67.1 million in assets, SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF (XSD  -  Free Report) saw an inflow of $7.6 million and PSI saw neither net inflow nor outflow.  Let’s delve a little deeper to find out what hurt SMH so bad.Tariff Tantrum: A Headwind for Semiconductors in General Such movements in semiconductors were due to President Donald Trump’s $50 billion levy on Chinese imports, which has been retaliated by a Chinese levy on an equal worth of goods, including U.S. crude and gasoline.Both will now enact a 25% tariff on each other’s $34 billion of goods from Jul 6. The remaining $16 billion worth of goods will be under public review. But the situation may take an ugly turn as White House plans to enact tariffs on an extra $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, if China keeps retaliating to U.S. tariffs(read: Time to Buy Defensive ETFs?).As the tariff tantrum has taken the global market in its grip, investors are busy assessing which segments will be at most risks. Here comes the semiconductor pain. Per Morgan Stanley equity strategists, “semiconductor and semiconductor equipment companies have the highest revenue exposure to China at 52%” and are thus exposed to maximum risks on rising trade tensions (read: Apple's iPhone Order Cut Report May Hurt These ETFs).Chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report) has 65% revenue exposure to China, and optical components manufacturer Lumentum LITE) has 23% exposure. Per Goldman Sachs, Nvidia (NVDA)’s sales exposure to China is 56%. Apart from these, some other tech and semiconductor companies, which have sales exposure to China in the range of 22% to 55%, include the likes of Intel (INTC  -  Free Report), Micron Technology (MU and Applied Materials (AMAT  -  Free Report). This clearly explains why the mood is somber in the semiconductor space.Why Asset Flow of SMH Was Especially HurtPer an article published on etf.com, both SMH and SOXX are liquid, but SMH has defeated SOXX in terms of average liquidity. Average daily trading volume of SOXX is more than 5.7 million shares while Average volume of SOXX is about 650,000 shares. Average daily volume of XSD and PSI are nearly 135,500 and 80,100 shares.Such solid liquidity encourages investors to track the tariff-related developments and “the day-in, day-out performance of the semiconductor sector” via SMH more than SOXX. Investors mainly targeted SMH to follow the downbeat performance in the semiconductor sector last week thanks to the vehicle’s greater efficacy on a short-term basis.Investors should note that higher average trading volumes result in a tighter bid/ask spread ratio and lower trading costs. So, when the broader semi-market recoils, there is high chance SMH will see solid inflows. Moreover, SMH (0.35%) has a lower expense ratio than SOXX (0.48%). This is another reason that can revive potential inflows in SMH in the long term.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week. Get it free >>

2323,QCOM,"In the last five trading days, telecom stocks flattered to deceive as the initial upturn was replaced by a persistent downturn for the most part of the past week as President Trump renewed fears of a fresh trade war with China.The on-again off-again trade war between the United States and China took a new turn when Trump imposed a fresh salvo of tariffs worth $50 billion on Chinese imports last week. This followed an immediate retaliation by China, which promised to impose 25% tariffs on 545 categories of U.S. products worth $34 billion including soyabeans, beef, whiskey and off-road vehicles. China also threatened to impose $16 billion worth of additional tariffs in subsequent stages, targeting U.S. energy exports such as coal and crude oil.Meanwhile, the Senate dealt a body blow to Trump when it defied his decision and voted to overrule the administration’s deal with ZTE. With a unanimous majority of 85-10 votes, the Senate nullified the ZTE settlement plans, which included a $1.4 billion penalty and overhaul of its leadership among other conditions, and proposed an outright ban on the government buying products and services from it. Although Trump could use his veto powers to prevail over this decision, the contentious issue could further strain the relations between the United States and China.      Regarding company-specific news, technology collaborations, acquisitions and investments for clean energy ruled the roost over the last five trading days.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    According to a Bloomberg report, the South China Morning Post has claimed that regulators of China have approved Qualcomm Incorporated’s (QCOM  -  Free Report) $43 billion deal to acquire NXP Semiconductors N.V.China was the only nation opposing the buyout deal on issues relating to antitrust concerns.

The Industrials Select Sector SPDR (XLI) declined 2.1%, while the Materials Select Sector SPDR (XLB) declined 1.8%. The tech heavy Nasdaq lost 21.44 points.Fears of Trade War EscalateFears of a trade war between the United States and China once gain made investors jittery. On Monday, President Donald Trump ordered United States Trade Representative to identify Chinese goods worth $200 billion for additional tariffs of 10%. Trump also threatened China that the United States would impose tariffs on additional $200 billion goods if China tried to retaliate.Consequently, China too said that it would have to take comprehensive measures to counter United States’ trade moves. This once again dented investors’ confidence and rattled markets. Shares of chipmakers, which heavily depend on China for a large portion of their revenues, tumbled on the news. Shares of NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) and QUALCOMM Incorporated (QCOM  -  Free Report) declined 1.8% and 0.8%, respectively. Shares of Broadcom Inc.

2325,QCOM,"The U.S-China trade spat has started taking its toll on tech companies, particularly chipmaker stocks. On Jun 19, President Donald Trump asked the United States Trade Representative to identify Chinese goods worth $200 billion for additional tariffs. Consequently, China too said that it would have to take comprehensive measures to counter U.S. trade moves.This has resulted in stocks tumbling once again. Given that China accounts for a large portion of revenues for a number of U.S. tech companies, which include chipmakers, mobile phones and technology-based service providers, there are high chances of these players suffering significantly.Trade War Fears EscalateOn Jun 15, Trump announced tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese goods including semiconductors. China wasted no time in retaliating with tariffs on $34 billion U.S. goods. Markets were further rattled on Jun 19, after Trump asked the United States Trade Representative to identify Chinese goods worth $200 billion for additional tariffs of 10%.This further escalated trade war fears, resulting in huge sell offs. Tech stocks have been suffering particularly as China accounts for a large portion of revenues for a number of U.S. companies.Apple Fears the Worst Bite Trump’s announcement of 25% tariffs on up to $50 billion of Chinese goods including semiconductors could make Apple, Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) one of the biggest victims of a U.S.-China trade war. Apple is the most successful U.S. tech company in China. In 2017, the iPhone maker generated approximately 20% of its revenues from China, shipping more than 41 million iPhone to China in 2017. Moreover, Apple operates its services like Apple Music and App Store in China.  A trade war could result in China banning Apple’s services, which it did in 2016 by shutting down iTunes Movies and iBooks Store. Services are becoming an integral part of Apple’s business in a slowing smartphone market. Another increasing concern is: what if China bans Apple citing concerns of national security just like the United Stated cautioned customers not to buy Chinese mobile phone maker Huawei on fears of being spied by the Chinese? This would hurt Apple’s business severely. Shares of Apple declined 1.6% on Jun 19.Chipmakers to Bear the BruntChipmakers with significant exposure to China were hit on Tuesday, following Trump’s announcement of 25% tariffs on semiconductors. Telecommunication equipment maker Lumentum Holdings Inc.’s (LITE  -  Free Report) shares tumbled 3%, while Qualcomm Incorporated (QCOM  -  Free Report) plummeted 0.8%.The United States is the largest semiconductor manufacturing country, with China being its biggest market. Naturally, higher tariffs will take a toll on the revenues of these semiconductor manufacturers. Qualcomm has tie-ups with a large number of Chinese companies, including Huawei. Qorvo, Inc. (QRVO  -  Free Report) too generates its almost 60% of its revenues from China. The company’s shares tumbled 2.7% on Tuesday.Similarly, other semiconductor giants like Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (SWKS  -  Free Report) and Qualcomm too depend heavily on the Chinese market. In fact, Apple and Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report) are among the top 16 U.S companies that generated a total of $105.5 billion from China in 2017. Qualcomm, Broadcom Inc. (AVGO  -  Free Report) and NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) generated respectively 16.6%, 9.5% and 1.9% of their revenues from China. Shares of Skyworks, Intel, Broadcom and NVIDIA declined 1.6%, 0.5%, 0.7% and 1.9%, respectively, on Tuesday. NVIDIA sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Bottom LineTech stocks have been driving markets for a while now. However, the U.S.-China trade spat has been rattling markets, with tech stocks, particularly semiconductors, at the helm of the carnage. Tech companies depend heavily on China, which accounts for a large portion of their revenues, and retaliatory tariffs would make things worse that they already are.  Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

2326,QCOM,"According to a Bloomberg report, the South China Morning Post has claimed that regulators of China have approved Qualcomm Incorporated’s (QCOM  -  Free Report) $43 billion deal to acquire NXP Semiconductors N.V. (NXPI  -  Free Report).China was the only nation opposing the buyout deal on issues relating to antitrust concerns. With the clearance, Qualcomm has moved past the last stumbling block, having earlier received approvals from eight of the nine global regulators.The go-ahead decision from the China’s authorities was pending for more than 18 months, leading to increased speculation regarding the fate of the deal. The approval was put on hold by China’s Ministry of Commerce as a bargaining tool to seek more concessions from the United States after the two nations were engaged in a bitter trade war. Moreover, the regulators had to contend with domestic chip companies, which raised objections to the deal arguing that it was a potent threat to their survival. The issue further spiraled into a full-fledged conflict when the U.S. government banned sale of components by American firms to the China-based telecom equipment maker, ZTE Corp. Citing a breach of an agreement inked last year, the U.S. Department of Commerce slapped a seven-year ban on sale of various components to ZTE after it was caught illegally shipping goods to Iran. This crippled the operations of ZTE and threatened its survival.Although President Trump refused to budge initially, he made a sudden turnabout and handed a lifeline to ZTE with the U.S. administration reaching a settlement. This included a fine of $1.3 billion on the firm, restructuring of its management and hiring of American compliance officers. In return, the Commerce Department lifted the seven-year ban on ZTE related to the purchase of components from U.S. manufacturers.Industry observers opine that the long-delayed Qualcomm-NXP deal approval from China was hastened by a favorable decision on ZTE. The green signal from all global regulatory authorities soothed investor nerves from the on-again off-again negotiations for a game-changing merger. Qualcomm will now aim to close the transaction before the July deadline, failing which it risks paying a compensation of $2 billion for the termination of the deal.The transaction will help Qualcomm to diversify its revenue stream, which primarily relied on chip sales to mobile phone manufacturers that is fast becoming a saturated market. NXP has a considerable presence in the budding market for automotive chips. Therefore, the acquisition of NXP will enable Qualcomm to diversify into highly lucrative end markets such as auto, secured devices, connectivity and secure payments. These segments offer high-margin businesses with strong potential for growth.Over the past six months, Qualcomm has incurred a loss of 9% against the industry growth of 4.9%. It remains to be seen whether this acquisition can boost shares of the company.Qualcomm currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some top-ranked stocks in the same space are Motorola Solutions, Inc. (MSI  -  Free Report) and Ubiquiti Networks, Inc. (UBNT  -  Free Report), carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Motorola has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 8%. It surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 12.1%.Ubiquiti Networks has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 18.6%. It topped estimates thrice in the trailing four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 8.9%.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

2327,QCOM,"If you are still holding on to shares of Ambarella Inc. (AMBA  -  Free Report) in your portfolio, it is time you dump those as chances of favorable returns in the near term appear bleak.Similar to wise buying decisions, offloading certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns. Ambarella has witnessed a significant price decline in the year-to-date period, and negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the fiscal indicate bleaks prospects for the company in near term. Further, the company’s Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) only reflects its innate weakness.Ambarella manufactures video compression and image processing technology used in a variety of small cameras, computers and mobile phones. The company has a diversified product line, offering devices which fit into five main markets — Security Cameras, Automotive Cameras, Sports & Flying Cameras, Wearable Cameras, and Broadcast Infrastructure Systems.Shares of this chip maker have plunged approximately 12.5% since its last earnings results. In fact, the stock has been among the worst performers in the industry to which it belongs to in the year-to-date period. During the said period, Ambarella’s shares have lost 26.4%, while the industry has gained 5.1%.The latest downtrend is mainly due to the company’s recently-issued disappointing outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2019, wherein it projects a decline in revenues, contraction in gross margin and rise in operating expenses.Let’s take a look at factors behind this dismal projection.Loss of a Key CustomerAmbarella, most noted for its sports camera technology, has almost lost its one of the company’s largest customer — GoPro (GPRO  -  Free Report). The company produces a video-processing chip, which is a main component in the popular brand of GoPro action cameras. GoPro produces water resistant, wearable, high-definition cameras which produce unique first-person videos, and have been taking the Internet by storm for the last few years.However, since fiscal 2018, GoPro has been fulfilling its majority of requirements from one of Ambarella’s competitors. This is affecting Ambarella’s shipment volumes, resulting in revenue decline throughout fiscal 2018, as well as in the first quarter of the current fiscal. In fiscal 2018, GoPro’s contribution to total revenues went down to 12.8% from the 24.3% reported at the end of fiscal 2017. The company expects that revenues from the sales of chips to GoPro will continue declining throughout fiscal 2019.Drone Market WeakensPrevailing weakness in the drone market has been denting this chip maker’s revenues. The company witnessed four back-to-back quarters of decline in this market.Moreover, Ambarella projects softness in the drone market to persist throughout fiscal 2019. Per the company, drone manufacturers have been witnessing a tough time, and its major clients are now shifting focus on building low-priced drones, thereby impacting its top-line performance.Qualcomm May Heighten CompetitionThe company is facing a new challenge in the form of Qualcomm Incorporated (QCOM  -  Free Report). It should be noted that Qualcomm is also looking to expand its product portfolio in order to cope with its declining share in the mobile chipset market.It is set to acquire NXP Semiconductors (NXPI  -  Free Report), which is the world’s biggest automotive chipmaker. This acquisition is likely to help Qualcomm in expanding its foothold in new markets such as wearables, automotive, drones, and other Internet of Things devices. The entry of Qualcomm is a real threat as Ambarella may find it difficult to win new deals and might, as well, lose some of its customers.Bottom LineThe aforementioned challenges the company is facing right now do not seem to fade away anytime sooner. Furthermore, the stock’s valuation looks significantly stretched from a P/E perspective. The company currently trades at 55.4x based on its forward earnings estimate, massively higher than the industry’s average of 13.3. This limits its upside potential for the near term.Looking at the prevailing challenges, along with higher forward valuation multiple and Zacks sell rating, it is wise to stay away from investing in Ambarella stock right now.A buy-rated stock in the same space is Mellanox Technologies, Ltd.

Revenue (TTM) Apple Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Apple Inc. QuoteAlso, earlier this year, there were reports that Apple will not use Intel’s chips in Mac products in 2020, replacing them with in-house chips.This came as a blow to Intel, which terminated the development of its 5G modems (Sunny Peak), as Apple was anticipated to be its main buyer. However, the company is now focusing on developing a better 5G modem in a bid to feature in Apple’s 2022 lineup.Apple’s Diversifying Supplier BaseIn Ming-Chi Kuo’s research report this February, a supply chain analyst had stated that Apple will depend on Intel’s modems for current year iPhones in its attempt to be less reliant on Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report) as its primary supplier of chips.However, the recent development come as a blow to Intel as Apple is likely to choose MediaTek in its effort to rely less on both Intel and Qualcomm.This also applies for organic light-emitting diode (OLED) screens as Apple lowered its dependence on Samsung by investing more than $2 billion last year in South Korea’s LG Display Co.Apparently, the company was also in talks with China’s BOE Technology Group Co. to supply OLED displays for iPhones.Apple Rides on Flourishing PortfolioApple’s iPhone is the single biggest revenue driver but the company is now looking beyond it. In this connection, the company’s efforts to diversify its portfolio have paid off as its Services segment is the new cash cow for the company.Services, which include revenues from Internet Services, App store, Apple Music, AppleCare, Apple Pay, licensing and other services have been a key catalyst. The company is on track to double Services revenues of $24 billion in fiscal 2016 by 2020. The segment is expected to grow strongly driven by increasing adoption of Apple Music & Apple Pay.Apple is pushing into original content as it reportedly outspent Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) and Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report) division YouTube’s investment to acquire original programs.In addition to partnering with Oprah Winfrey to create original programs, the company also teamed up with Emmy award-winning television producer Sesame Workshop to create children's programming.Apple’s latest additions indicate its search for more diversified revenue streams, thereby anticipating top-line growth.Currently, Apple carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

It facilitates Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V), Vehicle-to-Roadside Infrastructure (V2I) and Vehicle-to-Pedestrian (V2P) connectivity without the involvement of a cellular network or cellular network subscription, by operating on designated and harmonized 5.9 GHz ITS spectrum.Qualcomm Technologies remains committed to supporting safe, connected automotive transportation and has been engaged with the V2X ecosystem for several years now. The Qualcomm 9150 C-V2X chipset empowers automakers and roadside infrastructure providers with enhanced V2X capabilities for safety and autonomous driving. C-V2X technology complements other vehicle sensor technologies by extending a vehicle's ability to see further down the road and providing a higher level of predictability for enhanced safety.The Qualcomm C-V2X Reference Design includes the Qualcomm 9150 C-V2X chipset with integrated Global Navigation Satellite System capability for accurate positioning, an application processor running the Intelligent Transportation Systems V2X stack and a Hardware Security Module to provide secure V2X communications.Qualcomm’s expertise in wireless technologies has allowed it to accelerate innovation, not only in the mobile industry but also in the automotive industry. The company has worked with the automotive industry by collaborating with industry leaders and supporting automakers with the technologies and platforms to help power connected and autonomous vehicles with a variety of communications, location and computing solutions.However, shares of Qualcomm have underperformed the industry with an average loss of 8.5% compared with 2.2% decline for the latter in the past three months. It remains to be seen if such collaborative efforts can boost the company’s return on investment and enhance its top-line growth, going forward. Qualcomm currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks in the industry include Motorola Solutions, Inc. (MSI  -  Free Report) and Ubiquiti Networks, Inc. (UBNT  -  Free Report), both carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

2332,QCOM,"Ambarella Inc. (AMBA  -  Free Report) is slated to release first-quarter fiscal 2019 results on Jun 5. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether or not this video compression and image processing chip maker will be able to post a positive earnings surprise in the quarter.Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 21.6%. Notably, Ambarella delivered positive earnings surprises over the trailing four quarters, with an average of 12.6%. So, let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at earnings of 9 cents, which reflects a year-over-year plunge of 77%. Additionally, analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly $56.2 million, down 12.3% from the year-ago quarter tally.What’s Behind the Dismal Projection?The company, during its fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings conference call, had mentioned that a considerable decline in revenues from the drone market will adversely impact its next quarter’s top-line performance. Per the company, drone manufacturers have been witnessing a tough time and its major clients are now shifting focus on building low-priced drones.Furthermore, revenue contribution from the sale of sports camera chips to GoPro (GPRO  -  Free Report) will likely continue declining. It should be noted that GoPro was one of the largest customers of Ambarella’s video-processing chips.However, since fiscal 2018, GoPro has been fulfilling its majority of requirements from one of Ambarella’s competitors. This is hurting Ambarella’s shipment volumes, resulting in revenue decline throughout last fiscal. In fiscal 2018, GoPro’s contribution to total revenues went down to 12.8%, from 24.3% in fiscal 2017.The company projects that the revenues from sales of chips to GoPro will continue declining throughout fiscal 2019.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Ambarella is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Ambarella carries a Zacks Rank of 3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 9 cents. The combination of Ambarella's Zacks Rank #3 and Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.Ambarella, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Ambarella, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Ambarella, Inc. QuoteSome Stocks With Favorable CombinationsHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:QUALCOMM Incorporated (QCOM  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +7.21% and carries a Zacks Rank of 3.

2333,QCOM,"Qualcomm Incorporated (QCOM  -  Free Report) has unveiled the world’s first dedicated Extended Reality (XR) platform, the Qualcomm Snapdragon XR1, at the backdrop of the annual Augmented World Expo. The XR1 Platform was rolled out by the company’s subsidiary, Qualcomm Technologies, Inc.Qualcomm Takes the Next Step in Mobile VR SpaceThe communication technology firm has been dedicatedly working toward maintaining its dominance in the mobile virtual reality (VR) community for the past few years, continuously developing and improving on both hardware and software. These efforts are reflected in the launch of the Snapdragon XR1, which encompasses VR, augmented reality (AR) and mixed reality platforms. The XR1 Platform contains all the necessary materials required for original equipment manufacturers (OEM) to build next generation AR and VR devices. It has diverse compute architecture, including an AI engine. This will enable richer interactive experiences with better power and thermal efficiency. The company also announced that OEMs Meta, VIVE, Vuzix and Pico have already adopted the XR1 platform and started developing it.Star Features of the New Snapdragon XR1The platform’s support for ultra HD 4K video playback at up to 60 frames per second will enable a unique experience of watching movies or sports with reduced snapshot noise, wider range of display options with hardware driven composition, dual-display, advanced vision processing capabilities, which will allow locomotion in the virtual world or interaction with augmented objects in an AR experience.The audio experience is also expected to be phenomenal with the company’s existing technologies like 3D Audio Suite, Qualcomm Aqstic Audio Technologies and Qualcomm aptX Audio, enabling dynamic headroom experience. Additionally, there are also features like Bluetooth playback and “always-on, always-listening” voice assistance. Further, the head-related transfer functions allow the experience of binaural audio, creating a 3D-like sound.The platform boasts three and six degrees of freedom head tracking and controller capabilities, introducing mainstream users to an XR playground, which will allow them to move about, interact and play within this virtual world.Strategy to Address an Important Market GapThe company is aware that a good part of the consumer community believes that AR and VR devices are expensive and difficult to assemble, forcing them to opt for standalone devices rather than smartphone-dependent options. This market gap led Qualcomm to push the Snapdragon XR1 platform in the market. Being placed in slightly lower tier than the flagship Snapdragon 845 Xtended Reality platform, the XR1 is expected to complement the latter.Will the XR1 Prove to be a Profit-Generating Platform?Going by the fact that Qualcomm’s Snapdragon XR1 is the first platform purely dedicated to XR, this technological innovation is likely to lead to a rise in new orders for the company and boost revenues. The company hopes that the leading device manufacturers will use the technology to build successful products. These products, in turn, are expected to drive the company’s profit generation.Price PerformanceThe stock has outperformed the industry in the past month, yielding 14.1% return compared with 5.2% rise for the latter.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderQualcomm currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the industry space are BlackBerry Limited (BB  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Motorola Solutions, Inc. (MSI  -  Free Report) and Ubiquiti Networks, Inc. (UBNT  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

2334,QCOM,"If imposition of a respective 25% and 10% tariff on steel and aluminum imports was not enough, President Trump is reportedly going to levy new tariffs worth up to $60 billion on China, targeting mainly the country’s telecom and technology sector. The Trump administration is also reportedly mulling over “imposing investment restrictions on Chinese companies over and above the heightened national security restrictions.”Meanwhile, the threat of a trade war has been looming large since the start of the month. Already, the European Union (EU) has threatened the United States with a tit-for-tat tariff on a range of consumer, agricultural and steel products. Now China could be the next in line to levy a retaliatory tariff (read: Trade War Talks Heat Up: ETFs & Stocks in Focus).The relationship between the United States and China has been in the spotlight since Trump’s election win in November 2016, as evident from the volley of verbal attacks made by Trump against China’s trade practices. Investors should note that China stocks fell into the questionable spot after Donald Trump’s win in 2016. This is because Trump was expected to take stricter steps on outsourcing, on which China is hugely dependent.Naturally, companies that have extensive trade relations with China would be at high risk of falling prey to trade war. In fact, Goldman Sachs has compiled a list of companies some companies with considerable revenue exposure to China. Per the source, technology chip suppliers selling their products to manufacturers in China are likely to be hit hard.Which Large-Cap Companies Are At Risk on Likely TariffsWe highlight a few tech companies (according to Goldman Sachs’ study) that have high sales exposure to China.Skyworks Solutions Inc (SWKS  -  Free Report)The company, which makes highly innovative analog semiconductors, has 85% revenue exposure to China, per Goldman, quoted on CNBC.Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report)The leader in 3G, 4G and next-generation wireless technologies is dependent on China with 69% exposure.NVIDIA Corp (NVDA  -  Free Report)This semiconductor company’s sales exposure to China is 56%Some other tech and semiconductor companies, which have sales exposure to China in the range of 22% to 55%, include the likes of Intel Corporation, Micron Technology Inc., Applied Materials Inc., Lam Research, Apple and Amphenol Corporation.Time for Small-Cap Tech Stocks?While these large-cap stocks may get hurt by the possible trade war, investors can take a look at small-cap technology stocks, which are more domestically focused and thus less vulnerable to souring trade relations.Stock PicksThe following tech stocks have market cap of less than 1 billion.Xplore Technologies Corp (XPLR  -  Free Report)This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company is in the business of developing integrating and marketing mobile wireless Tablet PC computing systems. It belongs to a top-ranked Zacks Industry (top 30%).Super Micro Computer Inc.

2335,QCOM,"""The proposed takeover of Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report) by the Purchaser (Broadcom - (AVGO  -  Free Report) is prohibited, and any substantially equivalent merger, acquisition, or takeover, whether effected directly or indirectly, is also prohibited,"" the presidential order read.The order was purportedly based on the national security findings of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), but some news reports indicated that no formal order had reached the President and the decision appeared to have been made beforehand.Other reports quoted CFIUS as saying, ""A shift to Chinese dominance in 5G would have substantial negative national security consequences for the United States,"" and ""While the United States remains dominant in the standards-setting space currently, China would likely compete robustly to fill any void left by Qualcomm as a result of this hostile takeover.""According to a Jefferies report, which cited LexInnova research, Qualcomm is estimated to have a 15% share of 5G-essential patents, Nokia (NOK  -  Free Report) 11% and all of China 10%.At any rate, the presidential order can’t be challenged, nor can the findings of the CFIUS, although the CFIUS jurisdiction can be challenged.Broadcom is doing none of the above and instead stepping away from the deal, including the nomination of directors to replace the current board and focusing on its redomiciling plans. This is a win for the Trump administration because it will bring back tax revenue. There will be a negative impact on Broadcom because the tax rates in the U.S. are higher.On the positive side, Broadcom, once it gets rid of its foreign ownership/control, will be able to pursue most acquisitions in the U.S. without interference from the CFIUS or other regulatory scrutiny (other than the standard procedures).This was quite an unprecedented move wherein Qualcomm management approached the CFIUS to block the deal and the President moved to stop it even before there was an agreement between the companies. It shows that all is far from well at Qualcomm where shareholders were in favor of the deal that management and the board opposed.So now management have their work cut out: to convince shareholders that Qualcomm is worth much more than Broadcom was willing to pay. And they need to complete the NXP Semiconductor (NXPI  -  Free Report) acquisition as soon as possible.Qualcomm has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) while Broadcom has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

2336,QCOM,"After opening higher on the back of a strong February CPI, stocks tumbled into the red in early afternoon trading Tuesday. Some investors appear spooked by the latest political drama in the U.S., including the Trump administration’s decision to block the proposed Broadcom-Qualcomm merger and Rex Tillerson’s departure from the State Department.Through 1:45pm EST, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down about 0.15% on the day, while the broader S&P 500 index was about 0.44% lower than its Monday close. But the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite led the day’s losers, slumping more than 0.80%.One of the worst-performing tech stocks of the day was Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report), which dropped more than 4.5% in morning trading after President Donald Trump shut down the chipmaker’s proposed merger with Broadcom (AVGO  -  Free Report).In a presidential order released on Monday, Trump said “credible evidence” led him to conclude that Singapore-based Broadcom’s buyout of Qualcomm would have impaired the national security of the United States. The deal, if it had gone through, would have marked the largest technology acquisition in history.On Tuesday, President Trump ousted Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, the former CEO of Exxon Mobil (XOM  -  Free Report), from his position. Tillerson was considered to be a level-headed businessman with an appreciation for global deals, so his firing could be another indication that the White House intends to shake up trade policy.“The worry is with the Tillerson ouster and Broadcom blockage from the Trump administration that this will add fuel to the fire in a battle versus China on the horizon over the coming 12 to 18 months,” said GBH Insights analyst Dan Ives in a note.The Trump administration has already raised concerns about an impending trade war with China by implementing new tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. Metal exports to America are not a huge piece of China’s economy, but the tariffs were seen as a direct challenge to the Asian nation.But those tariffs will likely impact U.S.-based metal importers the most, leaving plenty of tech firms unscathed. However, Washington’s latest moves, including Tillerson’s departure and the rejection of the Broadcom-Qualcomm deal, could spell volatility for the sector.“While most tech names including FANG stocks are relatively insulated from any China worries/headwinds, this is enough of a near term concern for tech investors to take some profits after a golden run over the last few weeks with many of these names making new highs,” Ives added.Want more market analysis from this author?

2337,QCOM,"Donald J. Trump has released an order, asking Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM  -  Free Report) to immediately and permanently abandon its proposed takeover by Broadcom Limited (AVGO  -  Free Report). The Presidential Order put an end to what could have been the biggest ever tech deal, on grounds of national security. The deal would have affected United States' leading position in creating technology and setting standards for next generation mobile phone communications, as China is steadily taking a lead in the space.Apart from the dismissal of the proposed takeover, any substantially equivalent merger, acquisition or takeover, whether made directly or indirectly, shall also be restrained.The order also disqualified Broadcom's 15 proposed candidates from standing for election as directors of Qualcomm. It restricted Qualcomm from accepting the nomination of or votes for any of these 15 candidates.Meanwhile,Qualcomm has been ordered to reschedule its 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders on an earlier date, based on the required 10-day notice period from the issue of the written order. Shareholders of record as on Jan 8, 2018 are eligible to attend the meeting. The new date is expected to be Mar 23 instead of Apr 5.The White House further demanded a confirmation in writing from both the companies about the termination of the pending takeover in compliance with the order.Last week, the U.S. Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) investigated and reviewed Broadcom’s proposed $117 billion hostile takeover offer for Qualcomm.

2338,QCOM,"The semiconductor space remained largely unaffected by the broad market sell-off seen in early February. This is because the semiconductor industry is clearly leading the broad technology space this year on encouraging fundamentals, solid corporate earnings, strong outlook and investors’ continued appreciation of value-centric traditional stocks. The rally has strengthened courtesy of a series of consolidation, which pushed several chip stocks and ETFs to new highs.Below we discuss some strong reasons for investing in semiconductor ETFs.Hot TrendsSemiconductors  are the most important driver of overall technology growth as these are used in cars, electronic gadgets to planes and weapons. Robust demand for memory chips and other semiconductor products owing to the rapid adoption of cloud, Internet of Things, autonomous cars, gaming, wearables, VR headsets, drones, virtual reality devices, artificial intelligence, cryptocurrencies, and other advanced information technologies are fueling huge growth in the space (read: How to Invest in the Hottest Technologies With ETFs).Additionally, the deployment of 5G (fifth-generation) technology – the next wireless revolution - will likely create further growth opportunities.Encouraging FundamentalsThe twin tailwinds of Trump’s tax reform plan and a rising interest rate scenario are also pushing chip stocks higher. This is because companies like Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report), Intel (INTC  -  Free Report), and NVIDIA (NVDA  -  Free Report) hoard huge cash overseas and are poised to benefit the most from the reduced tax rates. Additionally, most of the chipmakers are sitting on a huge cash pile and are in a position to increase shareholder payouts. The cash reserves will ensure that these companies are not plagued by financial trouble in a rising interest rate environment (read: 5 ETF Ways to Tap Hot Semiconductor Stocks).Adding to the strength is a pickup in the economy and better job prospects that are giving a solid boost to economically sensitive growth sectors like technology, which typically performs well in a maturing economic cycle.ConsolidationThe semiconductor space has been witnessing an increase in mergers and acquisitions talks. The latest development is that Intel might launch an offer to acquire Broadcom (AVGO  -  Free Report), which was running after Qualcomm for months and now Trump has blocked its $117 billion bid due to national security concerns. Meanwhile, Qualcomm is trying to close its $47 billion acquisition of NXP Semiconductors NXPI, which was announced in October 2016 (read: Broadcom Launches Bid for Qualcomm: Semiconductor ETFs Surge).Marvell Technology Group (MRVL  -  Free Report) is also in the process of acquiring smaller rival Cavium Inc. CAVM.O for about $6 billion. The transaction is expected to be completed by mid-2018. Microchip Technology (MCHP  -  Free Report) also announced to buy Microsemi Corp  for $8.35 billion early this month. The deal is expected to close in the second quarter of 2018.Strong OutlookAfter generating record annual sales in 2017, the global semiconductor industry  begun 2018 on a strong note, posting its highest-ever January sales and 18th consecutive month of year-over-year sales increase, according to the World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (WSTS). The agency expects global semiconductor revenues to rise 7% year over year in 2018.Per Gartner, worldwide semiconductor revenues are expected to grow 7.5% to $451 billion this year buoyed by higher prices for both DRAM and NAND flash memory.Impressive EarningsPer the latest Earnings Trends report, earnings growth for the broad technology sector turned out to be very strong, with total Q4 earnings up 23.7% on 11.1% higher revenues. Semiconductors have contributed the most with 68.8% earnings growth, followed by 51.1% growth in miscellaneous technology (see: all the Technology ETFs here).Cheap ValuationPer a MarketWatch article, semiconductors, as a group, are still cheaper than the S&P 500. The PHLX Semiconductor Index is now trading at 16.1 times the consensus earnings estimates for the next 12 months, while the S&P 500 is trading at 17 times the estimates.ETFs to TapIn view of the reasons discussed above, we strongly believe that investors should consider semiconductor ETFs. Below, we have highlighted them. All these have a solid Zacks ETF Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy):iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (SOXX  -  Free Report)This ETF follows the PHLX SOX Semiconductor Sector Index and offers exposure to 30 firms with heavy concentration on the top five firms accounting for a combined 38.3% share.

2339,QCOM,"Following months of negotiations, the United States and China are again on the brink of an all-out trade war. The United States has targeted a flurry of Chinese goods, while China has vowed to respond with tariffs of its own, which could hurt U.S. businesses.Trade wars are never good for the economy and squeeze corporate profit margins. Thus, this escalating trade tension is weighing on investors’ risk appetite. This, in turn, calls for investing in low beta defensive companies. Such stocks provide risk-adjusted returns and steady earnings regardless of the state of the equity market.Trump Announces Tariffs on Chinese GoodsThe White House will impose a 25% tariff on $50 billion Chinese imports, which has increased the chances of a confrontation with China over trade.. The United States has decided to penalize China for stealing American technology and of course trade secrets. Chinese aerospace, robotics, manufacturing and auto makers will mostly be targeted.The tariffs will be passed in two phases. More than 800 Chinese exports, worth $34 billion, will be subject to tariffs beginning in July and another 280 or so will go through a public comment period and take effect later.Trump gave the green light after meeting top economic officials last week, including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer.Trump said that trade between two of the world’s largest economies “has been very unfair, for a very long time” and that the “situation is no longer sustainable.”U.S.-China Trade Trump has, in fact, kept the doors open for further escalation if China imposes retaliatory tariffs. He had earlier suggested that tariffs could apply to as much as $100 billion worth of Chinese goods.China Vows to Retaliate, Blames U.S. of Firing the First ShotChina has accused the United States for ratcheting a trade war. The Chinese government said that it will respond accordingly to U.S. tariffs. China has vowed to impose tariffs on 545 U.S. goods worth $34 billion. These include agricultural products, automobiles and seafood. The tariffs are expected to get implemented from Jul 6. Beijing will impose tariffs on another 114 U.S. goods like chemicals, medical equipment and energy products later.Beijing confirmed that it “will immediately launch tariff measures that will match the scale and intensity of those launched by the United States.” Beijing added that “all economic and trade agreements reached by previous negotiations will be nullified at the same time.” That includes a deal to increase purchases of American energy and agricultural products.China’s Commerce Ministry, by the way, urged all the countries to act together to stop such a trade war for the benefit of business houses and “safeguard the common interest of all mankind.”American Businesses Brace for More PainAmerican companies are poised to bear the brunt of a trade war. They say that the cost of critical supplies needed to make products could jump in the near term. Multinationals, in particular, remain worried about their future ability to do trade in China. Needless to say that China is a massive market for them.Semiconductor companies including QUALCOMM Incorporated (QCOM  -  Free Report) and Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report) were taken aback after the U.S. government decided to impose tariffs on computer chips imported from China. The Semiconductor Industry Association raised concerns by saying “while the U.S. semiconductor industry shares the Trump administration's concerns about China's forced technology transfer and intellectual property practices, the proposed imposition of tariffs on semiconductors from China, most of which are actually researched, designed, and manufactured in the U.S., is counterproductive.”Other multinationals like The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) are caught in the crosshairs of the trade war. For Boeing, China is a big market. After all, the airline manufacturer previously said that it expects China to spend almost $1.1 trillion in the next 20 years by acquiring more than 7,200 new airplanes. Lest we forget that China had threatened to buy Airbus instead of Boeing if the United States gets involved in a trade fight.Wall Street Takes a Beating on Trade WorriesGeopolitical tensions are, thus, headwinds for companies as they erode profit margins and affect the overall economy. U.S. bourses did close lower after Washington-Beijing exchanged blows due to the ongoing trade dispute.5 Ultra-Safe Stocks to Buy NowAs the markets are plagued with trade related uncertainty, defensive stocks seem to be the safest investment option. Such stocks are generally non-cyclical, or companies whose business performance and sales are not highly correlated with the activities in the broader market.

2340,QCOM,"Top Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report) news stories from last week were more to do with public relations than technology. So the headlines included news that it had to succumb to an employee demand on DoD deals, that congressmen questioned its data sharing agreements with Chinese companies, that Washington ads had to be pulled for non-compliance with new government directives and that a diversity motion was shot down at the shareholders meeting.It was also reported that the EU was getting ready to charge an Android-related antitrust fine, even as its self-driving unit Waymo announced it was considering a taxi service in Europe.  Pentagon Deals in Jeopardy After Employee RevoltThe 4,000+ employees that petitioned Google CEO Sundar Pichai have scored a small victory. With help from one of them, Google has framed a code of principles that say it will not allow its artificial intelligence to be used in weaponry or unreasonable surveillance efforts, particularly with respect to certain sections of the society, such as minorities, LGBTs, etc., calling it ""violating internationally accepted norms of human rights.""Pichai’s blog post did however say that ""We want to be clear that while we are not developing AI for use in weapons, we will continue our work with governments and the military in many other areas."" Thank God for small mercies because the government has been increasing spending on cloud supported defense services and Google was trying to win some of that business.Its chances have however dimmed if New York Republican Pete King’s tweet about ""a defeat for U.S. national security"" is any indication. It has also earlier been reported that a senior defense official earlier commented that the attitude within Google was “baggage” that made the company less attractive as a partner.The protests started with a DoD project called Maven, that uses artificial intelligence to analyze drone footage. Google says it wasn’t for offensive purposes, but employees feel that it’s a fine line.Questioned on Huawei TiesAll U.S. technology companies have by and large taken the government to court whenever they didn’t want to share information, even when criminal activity was involved. But that isn’t the way they play with foreign governments, it seems.Lawmakers have begun to take notice. So after questioning Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) on its data sharing agreements with Chinese phone makers, they have turned attention to Alphabet and Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report). The group questioning the companies includes Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR), Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), Rep. Mike Conaway (R-TX), Rep. Robert Pittenger (R-NC) and Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA).In Alphabet’s case, the question was about ""third party partnerships"" with ZTE, Lenovo and TCL and whether there were audits on the way they were handling user data.The company already has “strategic” deals with Huawei and in India, where a new data privacy bill is awaiting approval in parliament, it has also partnered with Xiaomi. It also has an agreement with Tencent. Unlike in the U.S., companies go out of business in China if they don’t do as the government says (as Google found out a few years back). So sharing any data with Chinese companies is like sharing data with the Chinese government.Alphabet, however, offered an email statement that said, ""We have agreements with dozens of (manufacturers) around the world, including Huawei. We do not provide special access to Google user data as part of these agreements, and our agreements include privacy and security protections for user data.""Washington Election AdsGoogle has stalled election ads in Washington state to take stock of changes to the recently modified campaign-finance reporting requirements and enforcement procedures a few days after state Attorney General Bob Ferguson sued it.The new law requires ad-serving platforms like Google to release details like the geographical locations of advertisers, the types of audience targeted and the number of views, among other things.""We take transparency and disclosure of political ads very seriously which is why we have decided to pause state and local election ads in Washington, starting June 7, while we assess the amended campaign disclosure law and ensure that our systems are built to comply with the new requirements,"" Google spokeswoman Alex Brasov wrote in an emailed statement.Google may not get off the hook very easily however because a couple of King County lawsuits say that it has been in violation of the law for years.Could See Android-Related Antitrust FineAfter fining the company last year over Google Shopping, the EU is getting ready to fine it again, this time over its monopolistic practices regarding Android.Complaints against Google, which started with Russian search engine Yandex, included the company’s policy of requiring hardware manufacturers to pre-install its suite of apps while preventing them from pre-installing certain competing apps. Google has since modified the practice, allowing pre-installation of competing apps as well.The decision is expected in July.Company Defeats Diversity MotionDiversity is another pain point for Alphabet because in spite of spending $265 million a year on these efforts, the company has 51% whites, 39% Asian and only around 30% female employees, according to some reports. Moreover, female employees are paid less than male, according to a recent lawsuit.On the other side of the fence, a lawsuit by James Damore blamed Alphabet for wrongful termination when he, in a highly controversial memo, said that the recruitment process was a discrimination against whites and that females were less capable of doing tech jobs.The fact of the matter is that when you have diversity goals, you have a discriminatory practice because where there will be two people equally qualified for a job, you will be preferring the underrepresented one based on nothing more than his/her sex, race, ethnicity or some such thing.At the same time, this may be necessary to ensure that some groups are not prejudicially excluded either because that might be unfair to the person concerned, or because the company may suffer, or both. Considering that a quota system is detrimental to a company’s prospects and may affect team work, it’s understandable that technology companies would want to take this slow.So when a Google employee represented the discrimination story to investors, suggesting that executive compensation be tied to diversity goals, the company advised against the motion, saying that diversity and sustainability were already included in its policy measures. And since founders Page and Brin control 51% of the voting power, the motion was easy to shoot down.Alphabet is not alone in this situation: Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) reportedly links 17% of bonuses to cultural factors including diversity, Intel’s (INTC  -  Free Report) annual cash bonuses are also similarly linked to diversity-based hiring and retention, while Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report) and IBM (IBM  -  Free Report) include diversity in qualitative assessment of executive pay.Waymo Taxis in EuropeAt the Automotive News Europe Congress in Turin, Waymo CEO John Krafcik said that the company was considering a partnership to enter Europe and that officials were currently engaged in studying the regulatory, policy and other differences with the U.S. The partnership is expected to help the company pick up share in a market where brand “Waymo” isn’t as well recognized as local players.From the start, Waymo has had close ties with Italy’s Fiat Chrysler (FCAU  -  Free Report), and recently showcased its level 4 self-driving car at FCA’s investor day. The company is set to deliver an additional 62,000 Chrysler Pacifica hybrid minivans to Waymo, further expanding its fleet. It is also going to add 20,000 Jaguar Land Rover electric vehicles soon.The company hasn’t announced its self-driving partner in Europe, but its deep relationship with FCA could be indicative of its future plans.RecommendationAlphabet shares carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

2341,QCOM,"Investors in QUALCOMM Incorporated (QCOM  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jun 15, 2018 $35.00 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for QUALCOMM shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, QUALCOMM is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Wireless Equipment industry that ranks in the Top 22% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, two analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while four have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 76 cents per share to 73 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about QUALCOMM right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options? Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

2342,QCOM,"Qualcomm Incorporated (QCOM  -  Free Report) recently announced that it has entered into separate partnerships with Samsung Electronics Co and Sprint (S  -  Free Report). Its subsidiary, Qualcomm Technologies has joined forces with Samsung to unveil the Snapdragon 850 in the latter’s upcoming 2-in-1 PC. At the same time, Qualcomm has teamed up with Sprint to offer free unlimited LTE data through 2018 for PCs which use its Snapdragon 835 processor.  The Snapdragon 850 chipset has been specifically designed for Windows 10 Always Connected PCs. It was preceded by Snapdragon 835, which was used in the first Always Connected PCs. The new processor, which assures better power efficiency, performance and connectivity, will only be available for PCs and will not be used in phones. The Snapdragon 850 can be considered to be a customized version of the Snapdragon 845, which was released for phones earlier this year.

2343,QCOM,"The overcast skies of trade conflict over the United States and China are finally showing signs of clearing up. The tensions, which commenced in March following President Trump’s imposition of tariffs worth $50 billion on Chinese imports, has been the primary reason behind severe volatility in U.S. markets for the last four months. In fact, the lingering tensions kept the markets on tenterhooks on apprehensions of a full-fledged global trade war.National Security Concerns Dominate Telecom SpaceThe Trump administration had barred U.S. companies from selling products to Chinese counterparts due to apprehensions of Chinese spying on Americans utilizing these high-tech products. This move is evidence of the fiercely aggressive stance that the U.S. government is taking to protect innovative next-generation products of the U.S. tech giants.U.S. government is deeply concerned about China’s drive to unseat the United States as the primary developer and supplier of state-of-the-art products in the fields of high-tech artificial intelligence, semiconductors, quantum computing and various other digital technology driven sectors. Notably, the Chinese government patronizes most of these big manufacturers. These companies have become serious threat to the U.S. economic and military supremacy.  Signs of ReliefOn May 25, the Trump administration stated that it has reached a deal to bring back ZTE Corp. in business in the United States. ZTE needs to pay $1.3 billion in fine and make some changes in its management to get back into businesses with U.S. companies.Last month, the U.S. Commerce Department issued an order prohibiting all U.S. tech equipment manufacturers from selling products to the Chinese telecom behemoth citing that ZTE violated the terms of a 2017 settlement. Notably, the settlement resolved ZTE’s evasion of U.S. sanctions for selling to Iran and North Korea.On May 26, The Wall Street Journal reported that China is set to approve Qualcomm Inc.’s (QCOM  -  Free Report) planned $44 billion acquisition of Netherlands-based NXP Semiconductors NV (NXPI  -  Free Report) in the next few days.Reuters also reported that Qualcomm is expecting to meet this week in Beijing with China's antitrust regulators in a final push to secure clearance for the deal. Notably, the proposed deal has got a nod from eight of the nine required global regulators, with Chinese clearance the only one pending.Who Will Gain?If the U.S. government finally withdraws sanctions imposed on ZTE and China approves NXP Semiconductors deal then the main beneficiary will be mobile chipset developer Qualcomm. The company generates nearly 28% of its revenues from China especially from ZTE and Huawei. Meanwhile, NXP Semiconductors is the largest manufacturer of high-performance, mixed-signal mobile chipsets with 14% market share. The combined entity is expected to generate annual revenues of more than $30 billion.Additionally, world’s largest chipset developer Intel Corp. (INTC  -  Free Report) will also benefit. Moreover, fiber optic component developers will also gain from removal of selling restrictions on ZTE. Major optical fiber component developers such as Acacia Communications Inc. (ACIA  -  Free Report), Oclaro Inc. (OCLR  -  Free Report), Finisar Corp. (FNSR  -  Free Report) and Lumentum Holdings Inc. (LITE  -  Free Report) are likely to gain if U.S. sanctions on ZTE are revoked.Acacia Communications and NXP Semiconductors carry a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). All other stocks mentioned above, carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Chart below shows performance of seven stocks in the last three months.Bottom LineThe United States and China are trying to defuse the trade war tensions by coming to a compromise with the tariffs. This week, high-level U.S. and Chinese delegations will sit for a meeting to ease trade tensions between the two countries. This will be the third such meeting within a month. Fading of trade conflict between two countries will also open business opportunities for several U.S. tech titans.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

2344,QCOM,"Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) is working on designing its own chips to analyze and filter live video content, per chief artificial intelligence scientist, Yann LeCun, as reported by Bloomberg.The chips would help in taking down content involving suicide or murder as soon as it is posted. It will also help in reducing energy consumption and substantial compute power required in case of conventional methods.Hardware PushThe social media giant is joining the ranks of other tech companies like Apple, Google, Amazon and Microsoft who are designing chips to fulfill their own requirement.In April, Bloomberg reported that Facebook is building a team to design its own semiconductors. The company’s job posting for hiring new talent in chip design sparked speculations in the industry. The company was anticipated to build such chips to power its new hardware products or boost its machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) purposes.Notably, Facebook’s focus on building its own chipsets will make it more self-reliant by reducing dependence on chipmakers like NVIDIA (NVDA  -  Free Report), Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) and Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report).Further, in-house chips will help the company improve on its margins.Shares of Facebook have gained 4.8% year to date while the  industry declined 7.3% over the same time frame.Building a Better CommunityIn November 2017, the company expanded its AI efforts to identify users with suicidal motives by recognizing patterns in their posts and live videos.After being criticized for its Live feature where suicide-related activities were also streamed, the company made investment in AI tools, increased the number of reviewers working on it and brought down the time taken to review those Live videos to less than 10 minutes.On the last conference call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg mentioned that the advanced AI tools have also helped them in detecting and removing a number of fake accounts ahead of the elections in France, Germany and Alabama last year. The tools are also instrumental in removing 90% of ISIS and Al Qaeda related terror content even before it is flagged by users.However, hate speech being dependent on local language is an area where the CEO thinks will “take more years to be able to do something reasonably.” The company is progressing on handling the issue by building an AI system and hiring more people for content review.Although investments in these may affect profits in the near term, these initiatives are expected to help Facebook build a stronger community in the long haul.Facebook, Inc.

2345,QCOM,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for QUALCOMM Incorporated (QCOM  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 18.2% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is QCOM due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Qualcomm Beats Q2 Earnings and Revenue EstimatesQualcomm reported healthy financial results for second-quarter fiscal 2018 (ended Mar 25, 2018), supported by better-than-expected performance in semiconductor business and lower operating expenses.The quarter’s results were negatively impacted by the ongoing dispute with Apple Inc. and its contract manufacturers (Qualcomm licensees), as well as the previously disclosed dispute with another licensee.Net IncomeOn a GAAP basis, quarterly net income came in at $363 million or 24 cents per share compared with $749 million or 50 cents in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted earnings per share (excluding the Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives segment and certain share-based compensation, acquisition-related items, tax items and other items) were 80 cents, comfortably surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 70 cents.RevenuesQuarterly total revenues of $5,261 million increased 13% year over year. Moreover, the figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,201 million.Segment-wise, Qualcomm Code Division Multiple Access Technologies (“QCT”) contributed $3,897 million revenues compared with $3,676 million in the prior-year quarter. EBT (earnings before tax) margin increased to 16% compared with 13% in the prior-year quarter, backed by strong operational performance in China and growth in adjacent areas which was offset by some impact of lower modem shipments.  Qualcomm Technology Licensing (“QTL”) generated $1,260 million, down 44% year over year. EBT margin was 67% compared with 87% in the prior-year quarter. During the quarter, the company did not record any QTL revenues for royalties due on sales of Apple’s or the other licensee’s products.Operating MetricsNon-GAAP quarterly operating income came in at $1.3 billion compared with $2.2 billion in the year-ago quarter, due to headwinds from weaker industry conditions and litigation costs in QTL.Chipset StatisticsDuring the quarter, in QCT, Qualcomm shipped 187 million MSM (Mobile Station Modem) chipsets, up 4% year over year.NXP AcquisitionDuring the quarter Qualcomm has inked an agreement to acquire NXP Semiconductors N.V. for an estimated total cash consideration of $44 billion to be paid to NXP’s shareholders. NXP is a leader in high-performance, mixed-signal semiconductor electronics in automotive, broad-based microcontrollers, secure identification, network processing and RF power products.The transaction is subject to receipt of regulatory clearances and other closing conditions. Qualcomm intends to fund the acquisition with cash generated from May 2017 debt offering, and cash and cash equivalents held by its foreign entities.Cash Flow & LiquidityDuring the second quarter of fiscal 2018, Qualcomm generated $516 million of cash from operating activities compared with $820 million in the prior-year quarter.As of Mar 25, 2018, Qualcomm had $37,946 million of cash and cash equivalents compared with $7,124 million in the year-ago quarter while long-term debt totaled $19,361 million at quarter end.Stockholders’ WealthDuring the quarter, Qualcomm returned $1 billion to stockholders. This included $845 million (57 cents per share) of cash dividends and $200 million through repurchases of 3.1 million shares of common stock. On Apr 17, the company announced a cash dividend of 62 cents per share (representing a 9% increase from prior quarterly dividend), payable Jun 20 to stockholders of record as on May 30.   Third-Quarter Fiscal 2018 OutlookRevenues for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 are estimated in the range of $4.8-$5.6 billion. GAAP earnings per share are estimated between 35 cents and 50 cents. Non-GAAP earnings per share are projected between 65 cents and 75 cents. Qualcomm is expected to ship 185-205 million MSM chipsets in the ongoing quarter.Going ahead, the company is expected to progress well with the execution of its $1 billion cost plan. It remains focused on closing the pending acquisition of NXP Semiconductors N.V. and is well positioned to drive the global commercialization of 5G.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. There have been two revisions higher for the current quarter compared to four lower.QUALCOMM Incorporated Price and Consensus  QUALCOMM Incorporated Price and Consensus | QUALCOMM Incorporated QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, QCOM has a poor Growth Score of F.

2346,QCOM,"President Trump is contemplating issuing an executive order to restrict select Chinese telecommunications equipment makers from selling products in the United States, per a Reuters report date May 2. Imposition of selling restrictions stems from U.S. administration’s concern for national security and will primarily target Chinese telecom equipment behemoths Huawei Technologies and ZTE.The Trump administration had previously barred U.S. companies from selling products to Chinese counterparts due to apprehensions of Chinese spying on Americans utilizing these high-tech products. This move is evidence of the fiercely aggressive stance that the U.S. government is taking to protect innovative next-generation products of the U.S. tech giants.However, the move does not sit well with U.S. companies that rely on Chinese imports as it will raise prices of telecom equipment utilized by telecom service providers. Nevertheless, a hike in product prices will certainly help U.S. wireless equipment manufacturers. That is why investment in some of these stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank should prove to be lucrative.National Security Concerns Dominate Telecom SpaceTrump administration is deeply concerned about China’s drive to unseat the United States as the primary developer and supplier of state-of-the-art products in the fields of high-tech artificial intelligence, semiconductors, quantum computing and various other digital technology driven sectors.Notably, the Chinese government patronizes most of these big manufacturers. These companies have become serious threat to the U.S. economic and military supremacy.  China runs a massive $375 billion yearly trade surplus against United States.Huwaei, ZTE Targeted EarlierIn fact, the U.S. government made AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report) drop Huawei smartphones from its offerings while Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM  -  Free Report) was barred from selling its chipsets to either Huawei or ZTE. On Mar 12, Trump ordered to immediately prohibit the proposed $117 billion takeover bid of Singapore-based Broadcom Ltd. (AVGO  -  Free Report) for Qualcomm.The government argued that third party entities, especially, Huawei and ZTE may get access to Qualcomm’s precious patents from Broadcom or at least a stalled R&D activity may result in Qualcomm losing its competitive edge in the upcoming 5G wireless network standard to its Chinese counterparts.Our Top PicksPresident Trump has given enough indication that his administration will take special interest in the functioning of the telecom industry. The safeguarding of the highly valuable patents of the American tech heavy companies from the Chinese dragon is of foremost importance to the American eagle.At this stage, investors will be better off to investing in U.S. wireless equipment manufacturing companies, which are expected to benefit the most from upcoming U.S. tariffs on China. We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks with favourable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) with strong growth potential.Chart below depicts price performance of our five picks year to date.Comtech Telecommunications Corp.

2347,QCOM,"Over the last five trading days, telecom stocks took an initial beating before witnessing a sharp rise, as healthy earnings surprises seemed to propel the industry.The industry initially received a jolt when antitrust authorities made it clear that a competitive environment was of utmost importance. The Department of Justice initiated a probe related to the alleged collusion between AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report) and Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report) to hinder consumers from easily switching wireless carriers. The bone of contention refers to the ESIM technology that allows consumers to switch wireless providers without having to insert a new physical SIM card, thereby making their businesses more volatile.Regarding company-specific news, earnings of major telecom companies ruled the roost. The industry’s earnings in general appear to be on strong footing backed by healthy growth dynamics thanks to the existing secular trends in cloud computing, artificial intelligence and Big Data.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Verizon started 2018 on a positive note with a relatively healthy performance in the first quarter, primarily led by the wireless business. The bottom line also benefited from significant savings from the tax reform.GAAP earnings for the reported quarter were $4,666 million or $1.11 per share compared with $3,553 million or 84 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. Excluding non-recurring items, adjusted earnings were $1.17 per share compared with 95 cents in the year-earlier quarter, comfortably exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.11. Consolidated GAAP revenues increased 6.6% year over year to $31,772 million on the back of solid performance in the wireless business. Excluding revenues from divested businesses, non-GAAP consolidated revenues were $29.9 billion, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $31,157 million.

The figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of loss of 3 cents.Net sales for the quarter fell 9% year over year to SEK 43.4 billion ($5.3 billion). The top line, however, missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,547 million. This was mainly due to lower revenues in market areas North East Asia as well as in South East Asia, Oceania and India. (Read more: Ericsson Q1 Loss Narrower Than Expected, Revenues Lag)3.    Qualcomm Incorporated (QCOM  -  Free Report) reported healthy results for second-quarter fiscal 2018 (ended Mar 25, 2018), supported by better-than-expected performance in semiconductor business and lower operating expenses.On a GAAP basis, quarterly net income came in at $363 million or 24 cents per share compared with $749 million or 50 cents in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted earnings per share were 80 cents, comfortably surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 70 cents. Quarterly total revenues of $5,261 million increased 13% year over year. Moreover, the figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,201 million. (Read more: Qualcomm Beats Q2 Earnings and Revenue Estimates)4.    AT&T reported mixed first-quarter 2018 results, with the top and the bottom lines missing the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate despite solid prepaid phone gains, record low first-quarter postpaid phone churn and continued DIRECTV NOW subscriber growth.On a GAAP basis, AT&T reported net income of $4,662 million or 75 cents per share compared with $3,469 million or 56 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. Excluding non-recurring items, adjusted earnings were 85 cents per share compared with 74 cents in the year-earlier quarter. Adjusted earnings, however, missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 87 cents. Consolidated revenues decreased 3.4% year over year to $38,038 million, primarily due to decline in legacy services, adverse impact of the transition of video from linear to over-the-top services and divesture of low-margin businesses. Revenues also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $39,452 million. (Read more: AT&T Misses on Q1 Earnings & Revenues, Reiterates View)5.    In a concerted move to meet the stringent low-latency data processing demands of Cloud RAN, Nokia Corporation (NOK  -  Free Report) launched the industry's first Edge Cloud data center solution.

2348,QCOM,"U.S. chip equipment makers have been gaining on superb growth in sales, earnings and cash flow for quite some time. In fact, a business-friendly tax cut policy signed by President Trump encouraged market pundits to upgrade sales and earnings estimates for U.S. semiconductor companies this year. Such a policy will make them more competitive with their global counterparts. The makers of computer chips, utilized in everything from smartphones to self-driving cars, have doubled since the summer of 2016 and have outpaced the broader market by a wide margin. After all, sales were boosted by an ever-increasing number of devices that are connected to the Internet. With escalating demand for personal computers and data centers, chips are required more than ever.The semiconductor-equipment group, semiconductor-manufacturing group as well as the computer-data storage group that includes some chip stocks rose 9.8%, 5.4% and 9% last week, respectively. Given such bullishness, investing in some solid semiconductors stocks having further upside potential won’t be a bad proposition.Biggest Tax Overhaul Boosts SemiconductorsThe House of Representatives approved the biggest overhaul of the U.S. tax code in 30 years, which mostly supported gains among the manufacturers of internal technologies, the semiconductor makers.As per Statista, corporate taxation rate in the United States was among the world’s highest. This explains why most of the semiconductor majors stashed a lion’s share of their earnings overseas. QUALCOMM Incorporated (QCOM  -  Free Report) used a large portion of its $30-billion overseas cash to acquire Netherlands-based NXP Semiconductors (NXPI  -  Free Report), while Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report) used its foreign cash to buy Israel-based Mobileye.But, the headline-grabbing move of the bill was slashing the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and that the companies will be paying between 8% and 15.5% instead of the earlier 35% to bring back money from overseas. This in turn will make semiconductors repatriate trillions of dollars held abroad and eventually drive their after-tax earnings. Chip makers can also use this extra cash for research and development, and mergers & acquisition activities (read more: GOP Passes Landmark Tax Bill: Best & Worst for Stocks). With Trump’s tax reform having a positive impact on the broader U.S. semiconductor industry, we have highlighted four top chip stocks that are on the move right now. These stocks also flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Micron Trends UpwardMicron Technology, Inc.’s (MU  -  Free Report) shares jumped 8.8% on Mar 12 and broke out of a 14-week consolidation period. The stock crossed the $50 mark for the first time since Sep 28, 2000, while a volume of around 57.7 million shares was more than enough to make it the most actively-traded stock on the Nasdaq. Micron has risen 27% over the past three months.Higher dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) chip pricing, margin increase in Nand chips and expected rise in capital returns were cited to be the major catalysts behind this upward journey. Strong demand for high-end mobile and data center products should also bode well for the provider of semiconductor systems worldwide.Micron’s sales per share soared 47% to $17.61 in fiscal 2017 from $11.97 in fiscal 2016. Earnings per share improved $4.45 from a net loss of 22 cents in the previous year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings increased 7.5% in the last 60 days. The stock’s expected earnings growth rate for the current quarter and year are a whopping 206.7% and 113.1%, respectively. The company has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Data Business to Propel Intel HigherThe world’s largest chip maker, Intel, will certainly benefit from its exposure to big growth markets and strength in investors’ sentiment. But, it’s focus on data-centric business is likely to drive growth in the near future. Emergence of Internet of Things (IoT) and smart devices is mostly driving demand for Intel’s products. This has led to Intel’s data business jump of more than 20% on a year-over-year basis.Intel has broken above the coveted $50 mark and is up nearly 10% from its early February panic low level. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings advanced 6.7% in the last 60 days. The stock’s expected earnings growth rate for the current and next quarters are 7.6% and 11.1%, respectively. The company has a Zacks Rank #1.ON Semiconductor Rides on Automotive SegmentON Semiconductor Corporation (ON  -  Free Report) is currently positioned to break its January high, banking on improving end markets and successful integration of big acquisitions like AMIS. But, product growth in areas like automotive cameras and IoT offerings are mostly driving the company’s bottom line.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings improved 4.2% in the last 60 days. The stock’s expected earnings growth rate for the current quarter and year are a superb 85.7% and 18.5%, respectively. The company has a Zacks Rank #2.Lam Research to Return Cash to InvestorsLam Research Corporation (LRCX  -  Free Report) is trading at the high end of a five-month range near $220. Management’s recent decision to return a minimum of 50% of cash flows to investors in the next five years in the form of dividends and repurchases boosted the share price. Lam Research is also benefitting from robust equipment demand, strong demand in the memory segment, strength in logic and foundry segments and increased adoption of 3D NAND technology.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings rose 15.7% in the last 60 days.

2349,QCOM,"Benchmarks closed mostly in the red on Monday with both the Dow and S&P 500 declining, while the Nasdaq increased over the day. Ever since President Trump imposed fresh levies on steel and aluminum imports investors have been concerned over prospects of a trade war. Fears of this nature dragged industrials lower during the session, a decline which weighed on the broader markets. However, tech-heavy index Nasdaq managed to end at new highs for second straight day following an investor friendly jobs report on Friday.How the Benchmarks Fared?The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) decreased 0.6%, or 156.64 points, to close at 25,178.61. The S&P 500 fell 0.1% to close at 2,783.02. However, the tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 7,588.33, gaining 0.4%. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) increased 7% to close at 15.67. A total of 6.52 billion shares were traded on Monday, lower than the last 20-session average of 7.2 billion shares. Advancers outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 1.22-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 1.45-to-1 ratio favored advancing issues.Trump’s Tariff Law to Initiate Trade War?On Mar 8, President Trump signed his tariff plan into law, which will come into effect from Mar 23. Per this law, fresh levies have been imposed on steel and aluminum imported from other countries. However, the plan excludes countries like Canada and Mexico, offering Trump a chance to renegotiate terms of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with the two countries.However, Trump’s protectionist stance raised concerns over a possible retaliation by other countries with similar kind of moves. This in turn had a negative impact on the Industrial Select Sector SPDR (XLI) which declined 1.2%, becoming the biggest loser among the S&P 500 sectors. Three Dow components from this sector, United Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report), 3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report) and The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) declined 1.9%, 0.6% and 2.9%, respectively.Nasdaq Hits All-Time High For Second Straight DayThe tech-based index hit an all-time high for the second consecutive trading day. Shares of Broadcom Inc. (AVGO  -  Free Report) rose 3.6% after a statement from the White House stated that the “proposed takeover” of QUALCOMM Incorporated (QCOM  -  Free Report) by Broadcom “is prohibited.” President Trump signed an Executive Order late on Monday, which ordered both the companies to ""immediately and permanently abandon the proposed takeover.""Broadcom was the second best performing stock among the Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK). The sector rose 0.3% with two of its key holdings, Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) and Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL  -  Free Report) increasing 1% and 0.4%, respectively. Both the tech giants possess a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2350,QCOM,"Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release first-quarter fiscal 2018 (ended Dec 31, 2017) results, after the closing bell on Jan 31.The company’s bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the previous four quarters. Earnings met the consensus estimate in the remaining two, resulting in an average beat of 6.31%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayQualcomm operates in a highly competitive global mobile semiconductor market with incumbents like Broadcom Inc. (AVGO  -  Free Report), Analog Devices Inc. (ADI  -  Free Report) and Intel Corp. (INTC  -  Free Report). Stiff competition in the wireless baseband chipset market has forced the largest mobile chipset manufacturer in diversifying into the lucrative IoT market.In August 2017, Qualcomm announced the acquisition of Scyfer B.V., a company affiliated with the University of Amsterdam and which focuses on cutting-edge machine learning techniques. It specializes in building Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions for companies worldwide and in a number of different industries, such as manufacturing, healthcare and finance. The acquisition of Scyfer will aid Qualcomm to advance its AI research and development.In July 2017, the company made available the Qualcomm Snapdragon Neural Processing Engine software development kit for developers from multiple industries—mobile, automotive, healthcare, security and imaging—to acquire tools for delivering on-device neural network-driven user experiences. With such booming prospects and strategic ideas, Qualcomm visualizes a world where AI would make devices, machines, automobiles and make things more intelligent, simplifying and enriching people’s daily lives.2017 has been a mixed year for Qualcomm. The company has been trying to retain its leadership in 5G, chipset market and mobile connectivity with, multiple technological achievements and launches. Management has taken significant steps to reduce cost by $1 billion per annum.Buoyed by such tailwinds, Qualcomm’s shares have gained 26.42%, outpacing the industry’s growth of 16.05% over the past three months.  On the other hand, aggressive competition in the mobile phone chipset market may hurt Qualcomm’s profits in the future. The company is facing severe competitive threat from its closest rival, Intel, which has been redesigning its chipsets for the mobile computing market. Intel started delivering multi-mode LTE baseband modem. Competition is also likely to emanate from formidable rivals like Broadcom and Nvidia.Broadcom already introduced its LTE baseband chipset in the market, while Nvidia launched Tegra 4i, its LTE-integrated application processor. Also, opposition from low-cost chip suppliers like Mediatek of Taiwan, VIA Technologies of China and Spreadtrum Communications is a concern. Although the global smartphone market is expected to maintain its momentum in the next 4–5 years, major part of this growth is likely to come from the low-cost emerging markets, which may exert pressure on Qualcomm’s margins.The $1-billion lawsuit related to licensing royalty payments, filed by tech giant Apple Inc. (in January 2017) against Qualcomm with the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, is getting uglier day by day. Since January 2017, there had been a number of counter attacks from either side. Initially, Apple had accused Qualcomm of overcharging for chips and refusing to pay some $1 billion in promised rebates.Meanwhile, Apple has garnered the support of Silicon Valley biggies and its suppliers in its nasty legal spat with Qualcomm. Apple’s suppliers have filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, accusing Qualcomm of “violating” the U.S Antitrust Law. They have claimed that Qualcomm continues to extract additional licensing money over assembling of iPhones. With so many twists and turns, we remain eager to see how this dispute actually pans out in the coming days.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Qualcomm is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Unfortunately, that is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: Qualcomm has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 90 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with the Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Qualcomm has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company has not witnessed any estimate revisions.QUALCOMM Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise  QUALCOMM Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | QUALCOMM Incorporated Quote Key PickAnalog Devices has the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat.

2351,QCOM,"Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM  -  Free Report) recently signed a memorandum of understanding with four leading Chinese handset developers, namely, Lenovo Mobile Communication Technology, Ltd., Guangdong OPPO Mobile Telecommunications Corp., Ltd., vivo Communication Technology Co., Ltd. and Xiaomi Communications Co., Ltd., for a multi-year sale of RF Front-End solutions. The value of the deal is more than $2 billion. Notably, China is the most important market for Qualcomm after the United States.However, the company also received a bad news. The EC (European Commission), the regulatory authority of the European Union, has slapped a fine of €997 million (approximately $1.24 billion) on Qualcomm over anticompetitive practices related to mobile chipset sale. The EC claims that an iPhone/iPad modem exclusivity deal between Qualcomm and Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report), which lasted from 2011 to the end of 2016, amounted to anti-competitive behavior. Qualcomm abused its dominant market position for 4G LTE chipset and payed significantly to Apple to secure modem exclusivity.Another Major Recent DevelopmentOnly a week ago, in a major relief to Qualcomm, the EC gave its nod to the company for the acquisition of NXP Semiconductors NV (NXPI  -  Free Report) with some restrictive conditions. At the same time, South Korea’s Fair Trade Commission also gave its nod for the deal. Notably, the deal has already been approved by the U.S. antitrust authorities. Only China is left to give its approval, which Qualcomm believes it will get very soon.The major positive of the contract is that it will enable Qualcomm to diversify its business model. The company is a leader in the mobile chipset market for smartphones and tablets. NXP, on the other hand, manufactures chips for next-generation automotive, industrial and Internet of Things (IoT) segments. Therefore, its acquisition of NXP will help Qualcomm to diversify into highly lucrative end markets such as auto, secured devices, connectivity and secure payments. These segments offer high-margin businesses with strong potential for future growth.The takeover will also push Qualcomm up the ranks to the second position after Intel Corp. (INTC  -  Free Report) in terms of sales in the broader global semiconductor market. Moreover, the combined entity will emerge a formidable challenger to other large semiconductor firms like Broadcom Ltd. (AVGO  -  Free Report), Analog Devices Inc. (ADI  -  Free Report) and ARM Holdings.Likely Effect on Broadcom’s Hostile BidOn Nov 6, 2017, Broadcom submitted a bid to acquire Qualcomm for a consideration of $130 billion (including $25 billion in net debt). On Nov 13, Qualcomm’s board of directors turned down the offer on grounds of inadequacy, as it is currently the largest mobile chipset maker globally. Notably, Qualcomm has a market cap of around $95.4 billion against which Broadcom’s paltry $105 billion offer is quite disappointing. Also, Qualcomm is uncertain about getting regulatory support for the proposed deal.Broadcom has since proposed replacing Qualcomm's board of directors and the matter will be put to a shareholder vote in March 2018. With NXP almost in its kitty, the enlarged Qualcomm could make it more difficult for Broadcom to take over the company.Moreover, the EC’s decision to fine Qualcomm $1.24 billion on charges that it offered discounts in exchange for chip purchase commitments will also raise questions on its business practices. The EC's ruling comes 13 months after South Korean regulators fined Qualcomm $853 million for alleged antitrust violations. The largest mobile chipset maker is also facing $1 billion lawsuit from Apple in the United States related to royalty and rebate payments.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.Click for details >>

2352,QCOM,"In the last five trading days, telecom stocks declined initially but later witnessed a steep rise as U.S.-China trade concerns abated with both parties signaling to put their differences on hold and continue negotiations to bridge the huge trade imbalance.Last week, President Trump revealed that the U.S. administration is mulling a settlement of the trade embargo on ZTE as part of the ongoing trade talks between the two warring countries. This includes a fine of $1.3 billion against ZTE, restructuring of its management and imposition of strict security measures to prevent the theft of U.S. intellectual and national security secrets.In return, China has vouched to reduce tariffs on U.S. agricultural and farm products and has announced to cut tariffs on most imported cars from 25% to 15% from Jul 1. However, various U.S. lawmakers have voiced their concerns and raised their opposition to allow ZTE a re-entry into the market, citing cyber threat.  With heightened concerns for cyber security taking center stage, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security released a new cyber security strategy that hinges on five pillars – focusing on identifying risks, reducing vulnerability, reducing threats, mitigating consequence and enabling cyber security outcomes. The new framework would help to mitigate risks and strengthen collective defense mechanism to thwart potential cyber threats.  Regarding company-specific news, improved product launches for superior connectivity and high-quality content to subscribers at lower cost of ownership and, technology collaborations ruled the roost over the last five trading days.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Ericsson (ERIC  -  Free Report) collaborated with Japan’s mobile operator company, SoftBank Corp. to improve radio access network design in the Tokai region.

2353,QCOM,"Qualcomm Incorporated (QCOM  -  Free Report) unveiled Snapdragon 710 Mobile Platform, its first entry into the Snapdragon 700-series SoC (System on Chip) platform, an upgraded variant of the Snapdragon 660. Notably, the technology comes with better performance characteristics of the SoC. The Snapdragon 710, released by its subsidiary Qualcomm Technologies will enable users experience the sophisticated flagship smartphone features on mid-range devices.Experience High-End Features on Mid-Range SmartphonesThe Snapdragon 710 chipset is designed on 10nM process technology, the same as that of Snapdragon 845, which powers high-end flagship smartphones like the Samsung Galaxy S9+. The mobile platform runs on X15 LTE modem, supporting high download rates. The 710 also uses 4X4 MIMO and LAA (License-Assisted Access) technologies to increase data connectivity performance.Snapdragon 710: A RevolutionWith the new mobile platform, Qualcomm will make it possible for companies to manufacture mid-range smartphones with features of an expensive smartphone. The multi-core AI Engine, neural network processing capabilities, image signal processors and graphic units that are primarily found in expensive chipsets, will form the structure of Snapdragon 710. This will provide users with high-end advanced features like Face ID and Animoji but in select mid-tier smartphones.There are various other star features of the new chipset including 4K HDR playback, which enhances visual quality of HDR videos and apps. Further, Snapdragon 710 features Qualcomm Spectra 250 ISP, sporting professional-grade characteristics like superior low light photography, noise reduction, image stabilization and fast autofocus. This feature will make professional quality pictures possible with resolutions up to 32MP single ISP and 20MP dual ISP on reasonably priced smartphones.The platform uses an Adreno GPU to check power consumption by about 40% compared with the version of Snapdragon 660. Consumers will also get the benefit of recovering up to 50% of phone battery power within 15 minutes. This gain can be attributed to the Quick Charge 4+ feature.The Snapdragon 710 Mobile Platform is now available for device manufacturers and is expected to be available in consumer devices in the second quarter of 2018.Price PerformanceDue to headwind factors like regulatory issues and Qualcomm’s inability to close its $38-billion buyout of NXP Semiconductors, in the past 12 months, the stock has underperformed the industry’s 6% rise with an average return of 0.6%. Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderQualcomm currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks from the same industry are BlackBerry Limited (BB  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) plus Motorola Solutions, Inc.

2354,QCOM,"The technology sector has lately been spooked by a spate of negative news from some of its key companies. Among the worst hit were FANG stocks as Facebook’s (FB  -  Free Report) data scandal raised concerns over stringent regulations for the social media space, and a series of allegations from Donald Trump via Twitter on its business practices spurred Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) sell-off.The attack from industry players like chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM  -  Free Report) and semiconductor-equipment supplier Lam Research (LRCX  -  Free Report) added to the latest chaos. Taiwan Semiconductor warned of waning mobile demand for the second quarter and thus reduced its sales growth target for this year to 5% from its prior outlook of 5-7% growth while Lam Research offered a disappointing outlook for chip-gear shipments for the rest of the year.Notably, TSM is Apple's (AAPL  -  Free Report) biggest supplier and the negative news has taken a toll on shares of the technology giant. Apple shed $60 billion in two days following the news. Several global chipmakers also lost market value, including Analog Devices (ADI  -  Free Report), Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report) and Qorvo (QRVO  -  Free Report).While a number of these headwinds have spread negative sentiments in the space, the rapid adoption of cutting-edge technology and solid corporate earnings are expected to fuel growth. In particular, Q1 earnings from 29.9% of the sector’s total market capitalization reported so far are up 36.3% on 13.7% higher revenues, with 100% of the companies beating on earnings and 85.7% exceeding top-line estimates. Overall, earnings and revenues for Q1 are expected to grow 22.6% and 11.9%, respectively.Given the optimism, a number of stocks in the sector have seen their Rank surging to the top-most rung in a couple of days. These are also backed by strong fundamentals compared to many others. Any of these could be a compelling choice to beat the ongoing tech turmoil and make for great picks this earnings season.

2355,QCOM,"Qualcomm Incorporated (QCOM  -  Free Report) reported healthy financial results for second-quarter fiscal 2018 (ended Mar 25, 2018), supported by better-than-expected performance in semiconductor business and lower operating expenses.The quarter’s results were negatively impacted by the ongoing dispute with Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) and its contract manufacturers (Qualcomm licensees), as well as the previously disclosed dispute with another licensee.Net IncomeOn a GAAP basis, quarterly net income came in at $363 million or 24 cents per share compared with $749 million or 50 cents in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted earnings per share (excluding the Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives segment and certain share-based compensation, acquisition-related items, tax items and other items) were 80 cents, comfortably surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 70 cents. QUALCOMM Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise QUALCOMM Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | QUALCOMM Incorporated QuoteRevenuesQuarterly total revenues of $5,261 million increased 13% year over year. Moreover, the figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,201 million.Segment-wise, Qualcomm Code Division Multiple Access Technologies (“QCT”) contributed $3,897 million revenues compared with $3,676 million in the prior-year quarter. EBT (earnings before tax) margin increased to 16% compared with 13% in the prior-year quarter, backed by strong operational performance in China and growth in adjacent areas which was offset by some impact of lower modem shipments.  Qualcomm Technology Licensing (“QTL”) generated $1,260 million, down 44% year over year. EBT margin was 67% compared with 87% in the prior-year quarter. During the quarter, the company did not record any QTL revenues for royalties due on sales of Apple’s or the other licensee’s products.Operating MetricsNon-GAAP quarterly operating income came in at $1.3 billion compared with $2.2 billion in the year-ago quarter, due to headwinds from weaker industry conditions and litigation costs in QTL.Chipset StatisticsDuring the quarter, in QCT, Qualcomm shipped 187 million MSM (Mobile Station Modem) chipsets, up 4% year over year.NXP AcquisitionDuring the quarter Qualcomm has inked an agreement to acquire NXP Semiconductors N.V. for an estimated total cash consideration of $44 billion to be paid to NXP’s shareholders. NXP is a leader in high-performance, mixed-signal semiconductor electronics in automotive, broad-based microcontrollers, secure identification, network processing and RF power products.The transaction is subject to receipt of regulatory clearances and other closing conditions. Qualcomm intends to fund the acquisition with cash generated from May 2017 debt offering, and cash and cash equivalents held by its foreign entities.Cash Flow & LiquidityDuring the second quarter of fiscal 2018, Qualcomm generated $516 million of cash from operating activities compared with $820 million in the prior-year quarter.As of Mar 25, 2018, Qualcomm had $37,946 million of cash and cash equivalents compared with $7,124 million in the year-ago quarter while long-term debt totaled $19,361 million at quarter end.Stockholders’ WealthDuring the quarter, Qualcomm returned $1 billion to stockholders.

2356,QCOM,"Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), which has spent most of 2018 under a dark cloud regarding concerns about exposing its extensive amount of users to data mining, false news items, etc., still managed to blow the doors off Q1 earnings and revenue estimates: $1.69 per share outperformed the $1.36 in the Zacks consensus, whereas revenues of $11.97 billion surpassed expectations of $11.95 billion.

2357,QCOM,"QUALCOMM Incorporated (QCOM  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results after the closing bell on Apr 25. Both Qualcomm CDMA Technologies (“QCT”) and Qualcomm Technology Licensing (“QTL”) segments are anticipated to generate lower revenues in the quarter on a sequential basis.Whether this will lead to lower earnings remains to be seen.Top-Line WoesThe company expects higher-than-normal seasonality to affect its fiscal second-quarter results due to near-term inventory build in the handset market and ongoing impact of non-paying licensees. The fiscal second quarter is typically a seasonally high quarter for QTL revenues and a seasonally low quarter for QCT. Qualcomm expects that the lower QTL margins, due to higher litigation expenses as the impact of Apple nonpayment, is more pronounced in the fiscal second quarter. Moreover, QTL revenues are also likely to be affected by softer sell through due to lower demand in China. Qualcomm expects QTL revenues to be $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion in the to-be-reported quarter, down approximately 4% sequentially at midpoint, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1,261 million.Margin for QCT is anticipated to be lower on a sequential basis on lower MSM (mobile station modem) volume, partially offset by benefits from product cost initiatives. We anticipate that fiscal second quarter’s non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses will be flat to down approximately 2% sequentially, as increased litigation expenses and the reset of Employee Benefit taxes are more than offset by the absence of the prior bad debt charge. Qualcomm expects QCT revenues of $3.6 billion to $4.2 billion in the quarter, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $3,861 million, down sequentially from $4,651 million.Stiff competition in the Chinese market has added to the concerns. Moreover, Qualcomm has been facing challenges from low-cost chip manufacturers like MediaTek and Rockchip as well as handset manufacturers’ SoC (System on Chip) projects such as Exynos by Samsung. The company is also facing severe competitive threat from Intel, which has been redesigning its chipsets for the mobile computing market. Although the global smartphone market is expected to maintain its momentum in the next four to five years, major part of this growth is likely to come from the low-cost emerging markets, which may exert pressure on Qualcomm’s margins.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Qualcomm is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -3.12% as the former is pegged at 67 cents and the latter at 70 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.QUALCOMM Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise  QUALCOMM Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | QUALCOMM Incorporated QuoteZacks Rank: Qualcomm has a Zacks Rank #3. While this increases the predictive power of ESP, we need to have a positive ESP to make us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Capital One Financial Corporation (COF  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.79% and carries a Zacks Rank #3.

2358,QCOM,"The semiconductor corner of the broad technology market was badly hit last week amid a spate of negative news from industry players like chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing TSM and semiconductor-equipment supplier Lam Research LRCX.Taiwan Semiconductor reduced its target for sales growth in the global semiconductor industry this year to 5% from its prior outlook of 5-7% growth while Lam Research offered a disappointing outlook for chip-gear shipments for the rest of the year. Notably, the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index dropped 4.3% on Apr 19, marking the biggest one-day drop for the index since Feb 8. In the past week, the index was down 4.4%.Additionally, the analyst at Bank of America Merrill Lynch dampened the mood by cutting the price target on chipmakers with heavy exposure to Apple's (AAPL  -  Free Report) iPhone business, including Broadcom (AVGO  -  Free Report), Cirrus Logic (CRUS  -  Free Report) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS  -  Free Report). The analyst expects chip stocks to go 4-7% lower (read: Should You Snap Up Downtrodden Semiconductor ETFs Now?).As a result, iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (SOXX  -  Free Report), VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH  -  Free Report) and PowerShares Dynamic Semiconductors Fund (PSI  -  Free Report) shed more than 4% each last week and clearly underperformed the broad technology fund (XLK  -  Free Report) by a wide margin. XLK lost just 0.2% in the same time frame. The weak trend might continue this earnings season given the lack of positive Earnings ESP but a series of positive estimate revision could provide some upside.According to the our methodology, a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) when combined with a positive Earnings ESP increases our chances of predicting an earnings beat, while a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) are best avoided.

2359,QCOM,"Broadcom Ltd. (AVGO  -  Free Report) has been dominating headlines with its proposed merger with Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report). The status of that deal has finally come to a conclusion, with President Trump’s order to immediately prohibit the proposed takeover on grounds of national security concerns.Trump’s move came after an engrossing week which reflected Broadcom’s roaring plans to move to the United States, Qualcomm’s executive chairman stepping down from being enthusiastically involved in the company and chip giant Intel Corp. (INTC  -  Free Report) getting involved in the argument.The rejection stems from Trump’s concern of conceding China the upper hand in mobile cell phone communications. As Qualcomm emerged as one of the biggest competitors to China's Huawei Technologies Co, the Broadcom-Qualcomm deal would be a clear signal of losing technology-knowhow for this sector to China. This in turn makes Qualcomm a valued company.The DealIn the beginning, Broadcom had offered $70 per share for a total value of $130 billion that was subsequently rejected by Qualcomm. After the rejection, Broadcom presented the ‘best and final offer’ of $82 per share, which was rejected again.Broadcom made yet another acquisition offer recently for Qualcomm. The bid now stands at $117 million, or $79 per share, down from $82 per share previously.Broadcom intended to go ahead with the deal in order to reap the benefits of cost reduction.  Qualcomm’s investment in 5G wireless services as well as NXP purchase, which will offer significant exposure to self-driving cars and automotive market, will provide significant advantage to Broadcom. Moreover, Broadcom is eyeing this cash cow for its patent licenses, which amounted to more than $5 billion at the end of 2017.CFIUS ObjectionThe U.S. Treasury's Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (“CFIUS”) has outlined key concerns in a letter dated Mar 5, 2018 to both Broadcom and Qualcomm related to their proposed merger deal.The decision of the regulatory body is unprecedented in view of the fact that Broadcom’s proposed $117 billion (net of debt) bid for a hostile takeover of Qualcomm has not been finalized so far. The decision of the secretive government panel reflects an aggressive position by the administration to protect major American corporate names from being acquired by non-U.S. entities.Several Concerns Regarding the DealQualcomm is U.S. mobile chipset giant and a global leader for setting wireless standards, Broadcom is based in Singapore, notwithstanding the fact that the company expressed its desire in last November to shift its legal headquarter to the United States.Qualcomm generally spends more than 20% of its revenues on R&D every year. Massive investment in R&D is an integral part of Qualcomm to maintain its global leadership position in the smartphone chipset market.  Compromising Qualcomm's assets through arrangements with ""third party foreign entities,"" will significantly affect national security of the United States.It appears that members of the Congress and the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) are concerned that the emergence of Huawei as a major supplier of communications equipment and Broadcom’s chances of selling parts of Qualcomm to Huawei or another Chinese firm to bring down costs could see important communications technology get transferred to the Chinese.Redomicile Plan to Help Qualcomm BidBroadcom had announced its intent to redomicile in the United States. The company is currently incorporated in Singapore with headquarters there as well as in San Jose, CA.The redomiciling will help Broadcom to aggressively pursue the Qualcomm bid that was recently rejected. Qualcomm believes that the current offer undervalues the company.

2360,QCOM,"Broadcom Limited (AVGO  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results after the closing bell on Mar 15. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2%. Broadcombeat earnings estimates in the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 4.54%.Broadcom’s expanding product portfolio makes it well-positioned to address the needs of rapidly growing technologies like Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G. The company is also benefiting from strong demand for Wi-Fi chips and radio frequency solutions from smartphone original equipment manufacturers (OEMs).The company’s shares have returned 17.2% year over year, substantially outperforming the 11.3% rally of the industry.It has been dominating headlines thanks to its proposed merger with Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report). The status of that deal has finally come to a conclusion, with President Trump’s order to immediately prohibit the proposed takeover on grounds of national security concerns. But investors will certainly want to focus on Broadcom’s latest results to gauge its financial health as the deal gets terminated.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Key Factors to ConsiderSegmental Details & Strong Product PortfolioBroadcom is benefiting from strong demand for its wireless solutions. Last quarter, Wireless Communications (37% of total revenues) were up 33.4% year over year and 40% quarter over quarter to roughly $1.80 billion. Strong growth was driven by the ramp up in shipments of next-generation platform from the company’s large North American smartphone customer. Higher dollar content in this platform also drove top-line growth.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Wireless Communications segment revenues are currently pegged at $1.93 billion.Coming to the, Enterprise Storage Segment (13% of total revenues) it increased 15% from the year-ago quarter but plunged 12.2% sequentially to $645 million. The sequential decline was due to lower hard-drive disks (HDDs). However, strong growth expectation in the server and storage connectivity business will completely mitigate the negative impact from HDDs.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Enterprise Storage segment revenues are currently pegged at $937 million.Moving forward, the company’s has launched its first-ever silicon-proven 7nm intellectual property (“IP”) targeting application-specific integrated circuit (“ASIC”) platform for deep learning and networking markets.We believe that the company’s extensive product portfolio, which serves multiple applications within four primary end markets (Wired Infrastructure, Wireless Communications, Enterprise Storage, and Industrial & Other), will help it to positively impact to-be-quarter’s results.Acquisitions Plays an Important RoleAcquisitions have played a significant role in deciding Broadcom’s growth trajectory. The long-delayed Brocade acquisition will boost its position in the storage area networking (“SAN”) space.Broadcom was also targeting Qualcomm. Recently, the company made another acquisition offer for Qualcomm. The bid now stands at $117 million, or $79 per share, down from $82 per share previously.However, the U.S. Treasury's Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (“CFIUS”) has outlined key concerns in a letter dated Mar 5, 2018 to both Broadcom and Qualcomm Inc. related to their proposed merger deal.The decision of the secretive government panel reflects an aggressive position by the administration to protect major American corporate names from being acquired by non-U.S. entities.Broadcom has also stated its intention to redomicile in the United States that will help it pursue the Qualcomm acquisition again more aggressively. The move will also smoothen regulatory hurdles. Going forward, we believe that if the deal goes ahead Broadcom can reap the benefits of cost reduction. We note that it was able to derive cost cutting and financial engineering benefits from its merger with Avago Technologies.Qualcomm’s investment in 5G wireless services as well as NXP purchase, which will offer significant exposure to self-driving cars and automotive market, will provide significant advantage to Broadcom.What Our Model SaysAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.

2362,QCOM,"Keeping its earnings streak alive, Marvell Technology Group Ltd. (MRVL  -  Free Report) reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results. Quarterly revenues and earnings not only came ahead of the mid-point of the company’s guided ranges but also beat the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate.Additionally, the top and bottom lines marked a significant year-over-year improvement. Per the company, this growth stemmed from better sales execution and efficient cost management.Marvell president and CEO Matt Murphy stated in a press release that ""Our strong fourth quarter and fiscal year results continue to demonstrate that Marvell's strategy is working and that our team is executing it very well.”Quarter DetailsMarvell’s revenues increased 8.7% year over year to $615.4 million surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $611.6 million. Moreover, reported revenues came ahead of the mid-point of management’s guided range of $595-$625 million (mid-point $610 million).In the end markets, storage revenues (53% of total revenues) grew 4% year over year and 3% sequentially on better-than-expected demand at the SSD (Solid-State Drive) segments, along with elevated demand from enterprise and data-center operators.The networking business (25%) increased 5% year over year and 3% sequentially mainly due to increase in the network of processor product line, i.e. switch, PHY and embedded.Revenues from connectivity (14%) climbed 31% year over year, primarily driven by solid demand for “high-end voice-enabled” and home media streaming applications. However, sequentially, the segment’s revenues slipped 16%. Other product (8%) revenues during the quarter grew 20% year over year and 5% sequentially.Marvell Technology Group Ltd. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Marvell Technology Group Ltd. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Marvell Technology Group Ltd. QuoteMarvell’s non-GAAP gross profit came in at $383.1 million, up 17% on a year-over-year basis. Gross margin also increased from 57.8% to 62.3% on a year-over-year basis, primarily buoyed by a favorable product mix and higher revenue base. Gross margin also came in marginally higher than management’s expectation of 62%.Non-GAAP operating expenses rose 2.4% year over year to $217.6 million and were within the company’s expectations of $215-$220 million. As a percentage of revenues, operating expenses contracted 210 basis points to 35.4%. Marvell’s non-GAAP operating margins came in at 26.9% compared with 20.3% reported in the year-ago quarter. The results were positively influenced by higher gross margin and lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenues.The company reported non-GAAP net income of approximately $164.8 million during the quarter as compared with $118.4 million reported in the prior-year quarter. On per-share basis, non-GAAP earnings came in at 32 cents, up 45.5% from the year-earlier quarter’s earnings of 22 cents. Quarterly non-GAAP earnings also came ahead of the mid-point of management guided range of 29-33 cents (mid-point 31 cents) as well as beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny.Balance SheetMarvell exited the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.841 billion as compared with $1.732 billion in the previous quarter. The company carries no long-term debt. Cash from operating activities during the fiscal amounted to $571.1 million.During the fiscal, Marvell repurchased stocks worth $527.6 million and paid dividend of $119.3 million to its shareholders.OutlookMarvell projects first-quarter fiscal 2019 revenues in the range of $585-$615 million (mid-point $600 million). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $595 million.Management expects GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 62% and 63%, respectively. GAAP operating expenses are expected to lie between $250 million and $260 million, while non-GAAP operating expenses are estimated to be approximately $215 million.The company anticipates non-GAAP earnings per share in the band of 29-33 cents (mid-point 31 cents), while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 29 cents. On GAAP basis, earnings are projected to come between 22 cents and 26 cents per share.Our TakeMarvell ended fiscal 2018 on an impressive note, reporting better-than-expected results for the fourth quarter. Furthermore, the company provided encouraging fiscal first-quarter earnings guidance.Though macro headwinds and stringent regulations might put its financials under pressure in the near term, we believe strong demand for Marvell’s 4G LTE products will act as a catalyst. This will be supported by growth from the company’s wide range of the recently-launched Internet of Things (IoT) solutions.In an effort to expand offerings beyond hard disk drives to high growth areas such as data centers and wireless communications, Marvell entered into an agreement to acquire Cavium in the last quarter. This buyout will provide the company an opportunity to expand its offerings and access newer markets.The company’s current restructuring initiative will help Marvell improve cloud infrastructure and applications, which are projected to drive the top line. The latest buyback scheme also reflects sound financial position and favorable prospects.Nonetheless, intensifying competition in the High Definition (HD) storage drive market makes us increasingly cautious about the stock’s prospects. In the HD storage drive market, Broadcom (AVGO  -  Free Report) is Marvell’s main competitor as these two are the primary SoC (system on a chip) suppliers. Also, NXP Semiconductors, QUALCOMM (QCOM  -  Free Report) and Texas Instruments offer various components to the market.Given the fact that Broadcom has been trying to acquire Qualcomm, while the latter is already in process to buy NXP Semiconductor, the former will become a bigger entity, along with enhanced capabilities, which can supply SoCs as well as components. This might dampen Marvell’s long-term prospects.Therefore, despite the company’s strong quarterly results, Marvell’s shares declined roughly 3% during yesterday’s after-hour trade. The stock has unperformed the industry to which it belongs to in the year-to-date period. Marvell has gained 12%, while the industry recorded growth of 12.7%. Currently, Marvell has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A better-ranked stock in the semiconductor space is NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.NVIDIA has a long-term expected earnings per share growth rate of 10.3%.Don’t Even Think About Buying Bitcoin Until You Read ThisThe most popular cryptocurrency skyrocketed last year, giving some investors the chance to bank 20X returns or even more.

2363,QCOM,"U.S. tech companies can finally breathe easy, at least for the time being. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin on Sunday said that the U.S.-China trade conflict has been put on hold. This certainly is good news for U.S. tech companies, particularly chipmakers, which have been reeling under pressure since the two countries sparked fears of a trade war by imposing tariffs and counter tariffs on imports from the two countries.U.S. tech companies generate an estimated more than $100 billion in revenues from China annually. Understandably, the tech sector stands to suffer the most, as the trade war has increasingly focused on technology and intellectual property rights. However, both countries are now initiating talks and making efforts to pull back from an undesired trade war. Given this scenario U.S. chipmakers stand to gain the most. So, it makes good sense to invest in semiconductor stocks.Sigh of Relief for Tech Companies  President Donald Trump in late March announced that the United States would be imposing tariffs on Chinese imports worth $150 billion for alleged violation of intellectual property rights. Consequently, China too announced retaliatory tariffs. However, both countries since then have cooled down on their stance and are now negotiating to avoid a much-feared trade war. On May 20, Mnuchin said, “We are putting the trade war on hold.”This certainly will bring a sigh of relief for U.S. tech companies, as tech companies stand to suffer the most if trade war takes place. U.S. tech companies generate an estimated $100-$150 billion in revenues annually from China, with Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) and Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) alone generating $105.5 billion from China. Other companies like Microsoft Corporation (MSFT  -  Free Report), Qualcomm, Inc (QCOM  -  Free Report) and Broadcom Inc. (AVGO  -  Free Report) too make a significant portion of their revenues from China.U.S. tech companies have been reeling under fears of a trade war for quite some time now, which saw their shares taking a hit. However, now that both the United States and China are working on a possible solution to avoid a trade war, it definitely will boost the morale of tech companies.Biggest Gainers if Trade War is AvertedTech companies undoubtedly will be one of the biggest gainers if a trade war is avoided. From large caps to medium and small caps, a number of U.S. tech companies have operations in China. Naturally, companies who have their assembly plants in China stand to gain the most if the trade negotiations fall into place.Also, the Commerce Department last month imposed a ban on American companies from selling components to Chinese company ZTE for seven years, accusing it of misleading U.S. regulators after it settled charges last year of violating sanctions against North Korea and Iran.While this made the company announce that it was ceasing operations, the ban can also have an adverse affect on American chipmakers, as an export ban would definitely hurt the revenues of U.S. chipmakers. However, with Trump tweeting on Sunday that he is working with Chinese president Xi Jinping to get ZTE back into business, U.S. chipmakers have ample reasons to party.Our ChoicesIt goes without saying that after suffering over the last couple of months as a result of huge selloffs owing to fears of a trade war, U.S. chip stocks will stand to gain from a mutual agreement between Trump and Xi Jinping. While we wait for an amicable solution through negotiations, let’sadd tech stocks for quick gains.Now, picking winning stocks may be difficult. We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and other relevant metrics.NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) is the worldwide leader in graphics processors and media communications devices.

2364,QCOM,"President Trump has asked the U.S. Commerce Department to reconsider its order prohibiting all U.S. tech equipment manufacturers from selling products to the Chinese telecom behemoth ZTE Corp. Last month, the U.S. Commerce Department issued the order citing that ZTE violated the terms of a 2017 settlement. Notably, the settlement resolved ZTE’s evasion of U.S. sanctions by selling to Iran.The Trump administration had barred U.S. companies from selling products to Chinese counterparts due to apprehensions of Chinese spying on Americans utilizing these high-tech products. This move is evidence of the fiercely aggressive stance that the U.S. government is taking to protect innovative next-generation products of the U.S. tech giants.National Security Concerns Dominate Telecom Space Trump administration is deeply concerned about China’s drive to unseat the United States as the primary developer and supplier of state-of-the-art products in the fields of high-tech artificial intelligence, semiconductors, quantum computing and various other digital technology driven sectors. Notably, the Chinese government patronizes most of these big manufacturers. These companies have become serious threat to the U.S. economic and military supremacy. President Trump has given enough indication that his administration will take special interest in the functioning of the telecom industry. The safeguarding of the highly valuable patents of the American tech heavy companies from Chinese companies is of foremost importance to the U.S. administration.ZTE Targeted EarlierThe U.S. government has prohibited indigenous mobile chipset developers and optical fiber component makers from selling products to ZTE. Per a Reuters report dated May 2, President Trump is contemplating issuing an executive order to restrict select Chinese telecommunications giants primarily ZTE and Huawei Technologies from selling products in the United States.Notably, ZTE depends on billions of dollars in component imports from U.S. tech giants for its survival. Non-availability of U.S. mobile equipment dealt a severe blow to its businesses.  The company had already ceased major business operations resulting in massive loss of jobs in China.Moreover, per research firm IDC, ZTE is the fourth-largest seller of mobile phones in the United States with a 9.5% share of units shipped to the country. Consequently, banning ZTE from selling its products in the United States will be a death knell for the company.Who Gains if ZTE Ban is Revoked?If the U.S. government finally withdraws sanctions imposed on ZTE then major gainer will be mobile chipset developer Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM  -  Free Report). The company generates nearly 28% of its revenues from China especially from ZTE and Huawei. Additionally, world’s largest chipset developer Intel Corp. (INTC  -  Free Report) will also benefit. Following the news yesterday, the stock price of Qualcomm and Intel rose 2.7% and 0.4%, respectively.Secondly, fiber optic component developers will also gain from removal of selling restrictions on ZTE. Major optical fiber component developers such as Acacia Communications Inc. (ACIA  -  Free Report), Oclaro Inc. (OCLR  -  Free Report), Finisar Corp. (FNSR  -  Free Report) and Lumentum Holdings Inc. (LITE  -  Free Report) gained 8.7%, 2.9%, 1% and 2.2%, respectively.Acacia Communications has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). All other stocks mentioned above, carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Chart Below shows price performance of six stocks mentioned above in last three months. Bottom Line The United States and China are trying to defuse the trade war tensions by coming to a compromise with the tariffs. This week, high-level U.S. and Chinese delegations will sit for a meeting to reduce trade tension between the two countries. This will be the second such meeting in this month. Relaxation of sanctions on ZTE will also open business opportunities for several U.S. tech titans.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!

2365,QCOM,"In a major relief to Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM  -  Free Report), the EC (European Commission), the regulatory authority of the European Union, gave its nod for the acquisition of NXP Semiconductors NV (NXPI  -  Free Report) with some restrictive conditions. At the same time, South Korea’s Fair Trade Commission has also given its nod for the deal. Notably, the deal has already been approved by the U.S. antitrust authorities. Only China is left to give its approval, which Qualcomm believes it will get very soon.On Oct 27, 2016, Qualcomm had entered into a definitive agreement with the Netherlands-based mobile chipset giant for the latter’s acquisition. Per the deal, the largest mobile chipset manufacturer would be paying $110 per NXP share in cash, reflecting an enterprise value of approximately $47 billion (equity value of $39 billion) for NXP.In June 2017, the EC had launched a thorough investigation into the proposed acquisition. The regulator had conducted an in-depth probe to see if the deal leads to higher prices, exclusion of rival chipset suppliers and reduced innovation in the semiconductor industry. The merged entity is likely to command a strong market position with an extensive portfolio of baseband chipsets and chips for near-field communications.Concessions Offered by QualcommQualcomm agreed to grant rivals licenses to NXP's transport fare collection technology for eight years. The company also agreed not to take legal action against third parties related to NXP's near field communication (NFC) and secure element patents except for defensive purposes as well as for its own baseband chipset. NXP co-invented NFC chips, which enable smartphones to be used to pay for goods and store and exchange data.Qualcomm has told the EC that it will not acquire NXP's standard essential patents as well as some nonessential patents for near-field communications services, which the Dutch company can sell to another buyer. These third-party buyers would be obliged for three years to grant others royalty-free licenses to use those patents. Qualcomm will acquire a few of NXP's other nonstandard essential NFC patents though it would also be obliged to grant royalty-free licenses to others for use of those patents.Advantages to QualcommThe major positive of the contract is that it will enable Qualcomm to diversify its business model. The company is a leader in the mobile chipset market. However, in recent years, markets for smartphones and tablets have gradually slowed down. Additionally, these chipset businesses are low-margin in nature. In fact, the company’s business has remained stagnant for the last couple of years.On the other hand, NXP manufactures chips for next-generation automotive, industrial and Internet of Things (IoT) segments. Therefore, its acquisition of NXP will help Qualcomm diversify into highly lucrative end markets such as auto, secured devices, connectivity and secure payments. These segments offer high-margin businesses with strong potential for future growth.The takeover will also push Qualcomm up the ranks to the second position after Intel Corp. (INTC  -  Free Report) in terms of sales in the broader global semiconductor market. Moreover, the combined entity will emerge a formidable challenger to other large semiconductor firms like Broadcom Ltd. (AVGO  -  Free Report), Analog Devices Inc. (ADI  -  Free Report) and ARM Holdings.Likely Effect on Broadcom’s Hostile BidOn Nov 6, 2017, Broadcom submitted a bid to acquire Qualcomm for a consideration of $130 billion (including $25 billion in net debt). On Nov 13, Qualcomm’s board of directors turned down the offer on grounds of inadequacy as it is currently the largest mobile chipset maker globally. Notably, Qualcomm has a market cap of around $95.4 billion against which Broadcom’s paltry $105 billion offer is quite disappointing. Also, Qualcomm is uncertain about getting regulatory support for the proposed deal.Broadcom has since proposed replacing Qualcomm's board of directors and the matter will be put to a shareholder vote in March 2018. With NXP almost in its kitty, the enlarged Qualcomm could make it more difficult for Broadcom to take over the company.NXP is the largest manufacturer of high-performance, mixed-signal mobile chipsets with 14% market share. The company has a strong clientele serving more than 25,000 customers through its direct sales channel and a global network of distribution channel partners.The combined entity is expected to generate annual revenues of more than $30 billion. Also, it is likely to position itself as a strong player in the next-generation mobile chipset segment with a potential market size of $138 billion by 2020.Qualcomm expects the transaction to be significantly accretive to its non-GAAP EPS immediately upon completion. Further, the company expects to generate $500 million of annualized run-rate cost synergies within two years of the transaction’s closure.Price Performance of QualcommQualcomm’s shares have gained 31.9%, outperforming the industry’s growth of 13.6% over the past 90 days. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2366,QCOM,"Over the last five trading days, telecom stocks flattered to deceive as the initial upturn was replaced by a sustained downturn on concerns over the implications of the fresh restrictions issued by the U.S. government against Chinese telecom companies.Last week, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin led a delegation of U.S. officials in China to defuse the tensions between the two warring countries while Liu He, the top economic adviser of President Xi Jinping, headed the Chinese side in the talks. The Chinese officials made solemn representations to the visiting delegates to convey the plight of ZTE that invited most of the wrath of the Trump administration. ZTE also formally appealed to the U.S. Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security to suspend the seven-year ban on its products that threatened its survival and crippled operations.Regarding company-specific news, earnings of some telecom companies along with improved product launches for superior connectivity and high-quality content to subscribers at lower cost of ownership, and acquisitions topped the charts. The industry’s earnings in general appear to be on strong footing backed by healthy growth dynamics thanks to the existing secular trends in cloud computing, artificial intelligence and Big Data.  Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    Motorola Solutions, Inc. (MSI  -  Free Report) reported strong first-quarter 2018 results on the back of healthy growth across all geographic regions. Non-GAAP earnings for the reported quarter were $1.10 per share compared with 71 cents in the year-ago quarter, primarily driven by top-line growth. The bottom line exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 86 cents.Net sales in the reported quarter came in at $1,468 million compared with $1,281 million in the year-ago quarter, driven by organic growth of 10% and healthy performance across all regions. Quarterly sales exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,371 million.

While the endeavor would help the company save millions of dollars through reduced R&D expenses, it would also increase its dependence on slow-growing market for mobile-phone chips.Moreover, aggressive competition in the mobile phone chipset market is likely to hurt profits in the future. Although the global smartphone market is expected to maintain its momentum in the next four to five years, a major part of this growth is likely to come from low-cost emerging markets, which is likely to exert pressure on margins.

2367,QCOM,"According to a Bloomberg report, Qualcomm Incorporated (QCOM  -  Free Report) is mulling to exit the market for production of high-end processors for data-center servers in order to focus on its core businesses. The strategic move is likely to benefit Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report), which reportedly has a stranglehold of the market with 99% market share.Qualcomm is one of the largest manufacturers of mobile-phone chips in the world. With increasing saturation levels in the mobile-phone market, the company began developing chips for processors used in large data centers of firms like Alphabet Inc.’s  Google and Amazon.com, Inc.’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) Amazon Web Services. Although the chipsets used in smartphones and other mobile devices are shipped in large numbers compared to those used in large data center processors, they are priced much less relative to the premium price range of the latter and thereby generate lower margins.Qualcomm sourced technology from ARM Holdings Plc, a leading manufacturer of microprocessors and one of Intel’s fiercest competitors, to develop a server chip titled Centriq 2400. The product reportedly offered comparatively better results than Intel Xeon Platinum 8180 processor based on energy efficiency and cost, and created a buzz in the market after its launch last year.However, according to persons familiar with matter, Qualcomm is currently exploring options like winding down of the operations or finding a new owner for the business in order to reduce operating costs and focus on its core businesses. While the endeavor would help the company save millions of dollars through reduced R&D expenses, it would also increase its dependence on slow-growing market for mobile-phone chips.Moreover, aggressive competition in the mobile phone chipset market is likely to hurt profits in the future. Although the global smartphone market is expected to maintain its momentum in the next four to five years, a major part of this growth is likely to come from low-cost emerging markets, which is likely to exert pressure on margins.Qualcomm has underperformed the industry in the past three months with an average loss of 19.5% compared with a decline of 4.1% for the latter.Whether a core business focus can indeed help the company to turn the tables and improve its sagging shares remains to be seen.

2368,QCOM,"President Trump appears to have identified China’s Achilles’ heel, and he’s making the most of it.Accordingly, the President is doing everything he can to deny China the semiconductors it needs to get to “Made In China 2025” with the goal of forcing the Chinese administration to lower the country’s trade surplus with the U.S. by $200 billion.We’ve already seen ZTE as a casualty of this war, with management recently telling investors that the inability to access chips from companies like Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) and Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report) could be an existential issue.The U.S. has also blocked every deal China has attempted, directly or indirectly, to acquire American semiconductor companies or technology. Market research firm IC Insights’ president Bill McClean says that China doesn’t have the necessary technology to design and manufacture advanced chips today, even if it can muster the resources. So it’s believed that if the U.S. blocks China’s access to technology and prevents agreements to transfer technology as a condition of doing business in China, the country won’t be able to reach parity/lead in the market.Since this is exactly what China is looking for, we have the makings of a deal.So Mr. Trump took to tweeting again late Friday: “Our high level delegation is on the way back from China where they had long meetings with Chinese leaders and business representatives. We will be meeting tomorrow to determine the results, but it is hard for China in that they have become very spoiled with U.S. trade wins!”That result, according to state-run China Daily, is ""the constructive agreement between Beijing and Washington to keep discussing contentious trade issues, instead of continuing the two-way barrage of tariffs, which pretty much brought the two countries to the brink of a trade war.""In the meantime, China is not sitting around. There have been rumblings about a new fund to drive semiconductor innovation in the country and just as the U.S. delegation was meeting with the President, the Wall Street Journal reported that the government-backed China Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund Co. was getting ready to announce a 300 billion yuan ($47.4 billion) fund to drive development of its semiconductor industry. In 2014, it had raised 139 billion yuan ($21.8 billion) that was invested in over 70 projects across the country.Unlike last time when only the government and its agencies invested in the fund, this time, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has reportedly also invited U.S. chipmakers. It is, however, doubtful that they will invest in a fund set up to drive them out of business, especially given the current political environment. And also because an excessive supply of Chinese chips will drive down prices in the global market and affect profitability across the industry, thereby slowing down its pace of innovation.It’s hard to tell where the talks are headed but China is likely to agree to a compromise.RecommendationsBecause of the China related uncertainty on the segment, the semiconductor industry isn’t the best place to invest in right now. While some Zacks Rank #1(Strong Buy) options like Mellanox Technologies (MLNX  -  Free Report), Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report), Cypress Semiconductor (CY  -  Free Report), Micron (MU  -  Free Report) and Seagate Technology (STX  -  Free Report)) are there, it’s probably a better idea to take a look at the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

2369,QCOM,"Per Reuters, chipmaker QUALCOMM Incorporated (QCOM  -  Free Report) has started downsizing to improve its profitability. As part of its long-due promise to investors, management has initiated the layoff to trim annual costs by $1 billion or £704.6 million.The company reported that it has begun to reduce its full-time and temporary workforce, keeping the exact number of job cuts undisclosed. It has offered severance packages to the affected employees.  After evaluation of non-headcount expense reductions, management concluded that a workforce reduction is needed to support the company’s long-term growth.Furthermore, the size of the job cuts is large enough for Qualcomm to file a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification with the state of California.As of Sep 24, Qualcomm employed about 33,800 full-time, part-time and temporary employees.In January, the company said that it would implement a series of targeted cost reduction measure across its businesses in order to save $1 billion in annual costs, which was in alignment with its attempt to win over investors’ support against a hostile bid from rival, Broadcom Inc. (AVGO  -  Free Report). The bid, however, was cancelled by the Trump administration on national security grounds.Over the past three months, the stock has underperformed the industry with an average loss of 19.5% compared with 6.8% decline for the latter. Moreover, the company is likely to be hard hit as the U.S. government has banned sale of components by American firms to Chinese telecom equipment maker, ZTE Corp.Citing a breach of agreement inked last year, the U.S. Department of Commerce slapped a seven-year ban on sale of various components to ZTE after it was caught illegally shipping goods to Iran. The strategic move is likely to hit Qualcomm the most, as it accounts for the lion’s share of semiconductor chips used in ZTE smartphones.The chipmaker has been ramping up its operations since then to improve its earnings growth. At the same time, it is trying to retain its leadership in 5G and mobile connectivity with technological advancement. Qualcomm achieved a 5G data connection with the Snapdragon X50 5G modem chipset on 28GHz mmWave spectrum. Notably, it is at the forefront of driving Gigabit LTE and 5G in the industry.Qualcomm carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks in the industry include Comtech Telecommunications Corp. (CMTL  -  Free Report) and United States Cellular Corporation (USM  -  Free Report), both sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

2371,QCOM,"Stocks can move heavenward or fall back to earth based on the latest rumors doing the rounds. Intel’s (INTC  -  Free Report) stock did a little back-to-earth movement last week after Bloomberg said it could lose a key customer. Here are the details-Will Apple Dump Intel?Intel shares plunged in response to a rumor that Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) was planning to replace Intel chips with its own ARM-based A-series chips code-named Kalamata as early as in 2020. The rumor came from Bloomberg this time, so investors reacted strongly.There appear to be good reasons for Apple to do so-First, according to data provided by IDC, Apple’s PC market share has grown to 8.2% in 4Q17 from 7.7% in 4Q16. Apple and HP were the only major vendors that saw meaningful growth in the fourth quarter. Apple could be looking to increase internal efficiencies by streamlining the entire manufacturing process, driving further margin improvements while improving customer satisfaction.Second, Apple is the only one among existing PC makers with the financial and other resources to develop its own chips. It has gradually built its internal production capabilities to move away from chip makers, the latest split being with Imagination Technologies.Third, Apple has a history of doing this with its iOS devices and the results have been positive for the company.Fourth, while PCs remain its largest revenue contributor, Intel is in the process of transitioning into a data-focused company. This may take several years, but in the meantime, it is broadly expected to adopt new manufacturing processes in its server production lines first.  Fifth, analysts agree that Intel’s process lead on Taiwan Semiconductor is practically negligible at this point, i.e., TSM’s first chips on its 7nm process are expected to be comparable with the first chips from Intel’s 10nm one.But Intel investors shouldn’t be overly concerned.First, Apple accounts for 4-5% of Intel’s revenue, so a total loss of Apple’s business would have a relatively small impact on Intel. Particularly so because Apple is expected to continue buying baseband chips from Intel, at least in the foreseeable future, so even if the processor business moves away, the baseband business will remain.Second, Apple is in a huge fight with Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report), so it’s banking on its relationship with Intel as the alternative source. This offers Intel some leverage.Third, Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) and Qualcomm are working onWindows 10 laptops powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 processors and investors might be concerned that Apple going its own way perpetuates the ARM invasion on Intel. But note that that this doesn’t mean a total move away from Intel silicon. What it probably means is that there will be different versions of devices on the market. As Intel continues to launch new chips that are more powerful and energy efficient, its continued strength at the higher end appears assured, at least for now.    New Chips from ChipzillaContinued delays in its 10nm process have been a disappointment for Intel bulls, but the company has filled the gap with new chips every year that also included performance and power improvements on the mature 14nm, 14nm+ and 14nm++ processes.The latest in this lineup, dubbed the 'Coffee Lake' H series and U series were announced last week, along with the H370, H310, Q370 and B360 chipsets. It has also integrated its Optane memory with the new chipsets (except the H310) to support hard drive speeds that can match SSDs in some cases.Intel’s goal is very apparently to bring the very best performance to laptops no matter the size, purpose or price point. This will also see it competing better with Advanced Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report) on the low end.To that end, it has increased the number of cores in the new processors to four or six, in some cases doubling them, also increasing the number of threads to maximize performance. The Coffee Lake H series chips for instance bring 6 core processors to laptops for the first time (Core i7, Core i9, and Xeon models). The Coffee Lake U series on the other hand upgrade the Kaby Lake U series with improved graphics and power efficiency while doubling the embedded memory among other things to boost speeds.The Wind River SaleIn keeping with its goal of becoming a data centric company, Intel is trimming its operations where required. So the embedded software business it acquired back in 2009 for $884 million is now moving to private investor TPG Capital for an undisclosed sum. TPG also bought its McAfee security business last year for $4.2 billion. Intel shares have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2372,QCOM,"The semiconductor corner of the broad technology market continued its winning streak with the start of the New Year. This is especially true as the S&P Semiconductor Select Industry Index climbed 6.8% in the first few days of 2018 trading compared with gains of 4.6% for the S&P 500 Information Technology S&P 500 index and 2.8% for the S&P 500 Index (read: S&P 500 Tops 2,700: ETFs & Stocks Outperforming to Start 2018).As semiconductors have been the most important driver of the overall technology growth, it is now used in day-to-day life from cars, electronic gadgets to planes and weapons. Robust demand for memory chips and other semiconductor products owing to the rapid adoption of cloud, Internet of Things, autonomous cars, gaming, wearables, VR headsets, drones, virtual reality devices, artificial intelligence, cryptocurrencies, and other advanced information technologies are fueling huge growth in the space.In fact, global semiconductor sales picked up 21.5% year over year to reach its highest-ever monthly sales of $37.7 billion in November, and are on track to surpass $400 billion for the first time, representing growth of 20.6% year over year for 2017, according to the World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (WSTS). The agency expects sales growth to slow down modestly to 7% in 2018, as the so-called ""super-cycle"" in chip demand will fade slightly (read: Bitcoin ETFs: What Lies Ahead in 2018?).While this is true, a combination of other factors like a stabilizing PC market and waves of consolidation would boost semiconductor stocks higher. While Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report) rejected Broadcom's (AVGO  -  Free Report) initial buyout offer worth $130 billion in late 2017, the latter is still in the fight to acquire the communications’ chipmaker. Meanwhile, Qualcomm is still trying to close its $47 billion acquisition of NXP Semiconductors NXPI, which was announced in October 2016.In another major deal, Marvell Technology Group (MRVL  -  Free Report) is also in the process of acquiring smaller rival Cavium Inc.  for about $6 billion. The transaction is expected to be completed by mid-2018. Other potential takeover candidates include Cypress Semiconductor (CY  -  Free Report), Teradyne TER, Silicon Labs SLAB), Lattice Semiconductor (LSCC  -  Free Report), MaxLinear MXL, Nanometrics (NANO  -  Free Report) and Micron Technology MU.The upside in the sector is further confirmed by the Zacks Industry Rank as more than three-fourths of semiconductor industries actually have a solid Rank at the time of writing. Wafer Components, Memory, Wafer Fabrication and General have a Zacks Rank in the top 6% while other segments like Electronics, Radiofrequency, Analog, Circuit Foundry, Discretes, Power and Programmable Logic have ranks in the top 42%.

2373,QCOM,"Facebook Inc. (FB  -  Free Report) announced a partnership with Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi to launch its next generation of virtual reality (VR) products at the 2018 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.Facebook revealed that Xiaomi, apart from being the hardware partner of its cheaper VR headset – Oculus GO – unveiled last October, will also develop new VR headset called Mi VR Standalone exclusively for the Chinese market. Both the products are based on Oculus technology and powered by Qualcomm’s (QCOM  -  Free Report) Snapdragon 821 Mobile VR Platform.Facebook’s vice president of VR Hugo Barra, who worked previously for Xiaomi, revealed that the new product is similar to Oculus Go in terms of core hardware features and design. Apart from that, it also supports Oculus's mobile software developer kit, thereby making it easier for Oculus developers to bring their content to the Mi VR Store in China.We believe that Facebook’s attempt to diversify will help the company penetrate the world’s most populous market, where its main service has been blocked since 2009. Facebook's target to bring a billion people to use VR in the near future is expected to be aided by this.Notably, Facebook has gained 50.8% in the past year, substantially outperforming the industry’s 26.8% rally.Facebook’s VR EffortsFacebook’s focus to expand its VR capabilities is well reflected in Barra’s words who was quoted saying, “We’ve worked closely with Qualcomm to deliver the highest possible level of performance to meet the high computing demands of the standalone VR product category.”We note that Facebook is trying to fuel its ambitious AR/VR efforts with Oculus which it had acquired for $2 billion in 2014. Oculus has long been dubbed as a multibillion dollar opportunity along with Facebook’s other subsidiaries like Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp.The company’s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, said that Facebook will spend over $3 billion to build these technologies over the next 10 years. Zuckerberg believes that VR will emerge as a major computing platform in the coming years.Oculus GO, which carries a price tag of $199, will be shipped this year, per the company.Last October, following mixed reviews from critics and users, the company slashed the price of its other VR headset, Rift.Zuckerberg was quoted saying last February that the virtual reality efforts aren’t profitable now. However, he asked the investor community to be patient as investments in VR will take some time to generate profits.Apart from headsets, Facebook’s VR offering include Facebook Spaces. Spaces will enable users to connect with family and friends in an interactive virtual environment. Users can create their VR avatar and customize it to make it look like them. The app will not only help to create a virtual world but also keep users connected to reality by enabling Messenger calling.Given the massive growth potential, there is tremendous interest in AR/VR. Right from Facebook to Alphabet to Microsoft, all are pumping in resources to develop these technologies. According to an IDC report, global revenues from the AR/VR market will grow to a whopping $143.3 billion by 2020.Facebook, Inc. Revenue (TTM) Facebook, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Facebook, Inc.

2374,QCOM,"The technology sector is in focus this week with CES 2018 set to commence today and run through the weekend. Notably, it is an annual technology tradeshow conducted by the Consumer Technology Association every year in January in Las Vegas.Intel Corporation’s (INTC  -  Free Report) Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Brian Krzanich during a ‘Prime Keynote’ in the CES 2018 talked about the company’s initiatives in driverless vehicles and powering artificial intelligence (AI) technology through partnerships and strategic deals.Autonomous Vehicles & AI: Key CatalystsIntel revealed a number of partnerships in the space. At the event, the company announced few important partnerships — with BMW, Nissan, Volkswagen AG, and Ferrari — which show Intel’s growing dominance in providing AI platforms which will power future vehicles.It will also leverage Intel’s Mobileye-based mapping technology for improving self-driving cars navigation process.Intel also joined forces with SAIC Motor and NavInfo to extend crowdsourced map building to China. SAIC Motor will build cars of Level 3, 4, and 5. These vehicles will be powered by Mobileye technology, which means it will be able to handle most driving situations itself.Additionally, Intel is also moving ahead in the virtual reality (VR) and and non-VR gaming space. It collaborated with Paramount Pictures for the next-generation VR andnon-VR Challenger League.It is believed that the Automotive Edge Computing Consortium which aims at developing an ecosystem for connected cars to support emerging services such as intelligent driving, the creation of maps with real-time data and driving assistance based on cloud computing, bodes well for Intel.We believe that the company’s focus on the self-driving car market will boost sales of processing chips, sensor-chips, cloud software and many more, which will ultimately drive top-line growth.Krzanich alsoadded that Intel is shaking hands with Ferrari North America to brings its AI technology to the Ferrari Challenge North America Series races to be held on six courses in the United States this year. The Ferrari Challenge will use Intel Xeon Scalable processors chips to enhance the experience to viewers online.Other HighlightsIntel and Micron have also announced a mutual agreement to work separately in order to complete development of their third generation of 3D NAND technology. Intel and Micron will jointly develop the 3D XPoint at the Intel-Micron Flash Technologies (“IMFT”). The product, is expected to sample this year, and could enter production as early as 2019 at their joint facility in Lehigh, UT.Intel is also partnering with Advanced Micro Devices’ (AMD  -  Free Report) Radeon Vega M GPUs with a purpose to use them in its next generation CPUs. Aiming at notebooks and small PCs, this new processor, the 8th Generation Core Processor with Radeon Vega M Graphics will be available starting in spring.Bottom lineWith continued focus on developing new and more advanced AI technologies for self-diving cars, we believe the company is well poised to rapidly penetrate the autonomous car technology market, currently dominated by the likes of NVIDIA (NVDA  -  Free Report) and Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report).Estimates provided by various research firms further encourage us about Intel’s prospects in the space. According to data available from BI intelligence, 10 million self driving cars will be on the roads by 2020.Per Statista, the market for fully autonomous vehicles will grow to almost $6 billion, while partially autonomous vehicles market will reach $36 billion by 2025. According to Boston Consulting Group estimates, the autonomous car market will be worth $42 billion by 2025 and $77 billion by 2035.The company has also gained 34.7% over the past six months, outperforming the industry’s growth of 28.6%.Currently, Intel carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2375,QCOM,"On Jan 5, we issued an updated research report on Ambarella, Inc. (AMBA  -  Free Report).Notably, Ambarella, a producer of video compression and image processing semiconductors is facing decline in revenues from one of its major customer, GoPro (GPRO  -  Free Report). However, we remain encouraged by the company’s foray into other markets, such as IP security, automotive, non-GoPro wearable and drones/flying cameras.The company posted better-than-expected results for third-quarter fiscal 2018, keeping its earnings streak alive for the 10th time in a row. However, the company registered year-over-year declines in its top- and bottom lines, primarily due to a notable plunge in chip sales to GoPro, softness in the drone market and increased operating expenses.Nevertheless, Ambarella stock has gained 27.1% year to date, substantially outperforming the 12.4% rally of the industry it belongs to. Influencing FactorsAmbarella is pretty well-known for its cost and power efficient high performance video processing SoCs. These highly configurable chips are suitable for wearable camera, IP camera, automotive dashboard cameras and drone camera makers.Additionally, in an effort to diversify its exposure and decrease its dependency on GoPro, Ambarella entered the VR camera space with the launch of H3 SoC in January last year. The company claims that the chip will work  well in high-end drones and VR cameras. Though this space is already occupied by well-established players like NVIDIA (NVDA  -  Free Report) and Advanced Micro Devices, the company has the potential to solidify its foothold in this space given its track record of innovation.Moreover, Ambarella is planning to make chips for Internet-connected security camera companies and drone manufacturers using the technologies of VisLab that the company acquired in July 2015. Furthermore, with the combined technology, the company is anticipated to target auto manufacturers later, which is yet another positive.Ambarella, Inc. Revenue (TTM) Ambarella, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Ambarella, Inc. QuoteHowever, the company is witnessing slowing sales growth rate and deteriorating operating margin. The company, which has registered over 25% sales growth since 2012, suffered a decline for the first time in fiscal 2017. Also, its operating margin, which increased til fiscal 2016, contracted for the first time in fiscal 2017.Notably, declining revenues from GoPro will continue to adversely impact Ambarella’s near-term performance. In fiscal third-quarter 2018, GoPro’s contribution to total revenues went down to 20.7% from 30% in the year-ago quarter, which along with softness in drone market resulted in a year-over-year decline of 11.4% in Ambarella’s overall revenues.Moreover, the company is facing increasing threat from QUALCOMM (QCOM  -  Free Report), which is acquiring NXP Semiconductors to augment its presence in the same space. We are also apprehensive about the company’s disappointing guidance for the forthcoming quarter as well as downbeat revenue outlook for fiscal 2018.Nevertheless, its strategic initiatives to overcome the negative impact of the decreasing contribution of GoPro and diversify poise this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock well. This is also validated by its long-term earnings growth rate of 14.75%.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

2376,QCOM,"Broadcom Inc. (AVGO  -  Free Report) recently concluded the redomiciliation procedure of the company from Singapore to the State of Delaware in the United States. The now US company is headquartered in San Jose, CA.The newly issued common shares of Broadcom Inc are matched one-for-one with the existing ordinary shares of Broadcom Limited, as on Apr 4 post the market close. The new common stock of Broadcom will continue trading under the NASDAQ ticker “AVGO” from Apr 5. Furthermore, the company expects day-to-day functioning and management of its business operations to remain unaffected.Broadcom's President and CEO, Hock Tan informed that the company will invest $3 billion and $6 billion annually in research & engineering and manufacturing, respectively. Tan further anticipates that the company will pay additional taxes amounting to “several hundred million dollars” to the United States. President Trump’s “America first” policy has gained spirit with this announcement.Notably, the news of redomiciliation interestingly comes in the wake of Qualcomm’s (QCOM  -  Free Report) annual shareholder meeting which was postponed to Apr 5 by Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (“CFIUS”). Qualcomm’s shareholders are now expected to take a better voting decision.Brief HistoryTrump had blocked the company’s revised acquisition bid of $117 million, or $79 per share, for Qualcomm. The presidential order had put an end to what could have been the biggest ever tech deal, on grounds of national security. The rejection stemmed from Trump’s concern of conceding China the upper hand in mobile cell phone communications.The order had also disqualified Broadcom's 15 proposed candidates from standing for election as directors of Qualcomm. It restricted Qualcomm from accepting the nomination or votes for any of these 15 candidates.The U.S. Treasury's CFIUS had outlined key concerns in a letter dated Mar 5, 2018 to both Broadcom and Qualcomm related to their proposed merger deal. The decision of the secretive government panel reflected an aggressive stance by the administration to protect major American corporate names from being acquired by non-U.S. entities.Can Qualcomm Acquisition be a Reality?Acquisitions have played a significant role in deciding Broadcom’s growth trajectory. Brocade acquisition is likely to boost its position in the storage area networking (“SAN”) space.Broadcom Limited Revenue (TTM) Broadcom Limited Revenue (TTM) | Broadcom Limited QuoteBroadcom’s recent move will aid it to pursue the Qualcomm acquisition aggressively once more. The base-shift will also make the regulatory environment uncomplicated for Broadcom. Going forward, we believe that if the deal goes ahead Broadcom can reap the benefits of cost reduction as well as reduced competition.Qualcomm’s investment in 5G wireless services as well as NXP purchase, which will offer significant exposure to self-driving cars and automotive market, will empower Broadcom’s growth prospects.A possible merger of Broadcom and Qualcomm might create the world's third-largest semiconductor company, lagging Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report) and Samsung. However, this would affect competition in the industry.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderBoth Broadcom and Qualcomm carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the Electronics and Semiconductor industry is Mellanox Technologies, Ltd. (MLNX  -  Free Report), currently sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The projected earnings growth rate (3-5 years) for Mellanox is 15%.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

2377,QCOM,"Buoyed by the tax reform in the United States and a resurgent Europe, first-quarter 2018 recorded an all-time high tally of $1.2 trillion for global mergers and acquisition (M&A) activities. This portrays an intense consolidation wave across diverse markets, as most firms aim to capitalize on bullish macroeconomic sentiments to pursue transformative deals.According to Thomson Reuters data, M&A surged 67% year over year although total number of transactions declined 10% to 10,338. This implies that the average deal size increased with clarity on tax and solid equity and debt markets, all of which swelled corporate cash coffers and helped top management to loosen the purse strings. The transactions were also not concentrated in any particular geographic region and were well spread out as M&A volume doubled in Europe, while increasing 67% and 11% in the United States and Asia, respectively.A $67 billion deal inked by U.S. health insurer Cigna Corporation (CI  -  Free Report) to acquire pharmacy chain Express Scripts Holding Company (ESRX  -  Free Report) was the biggest M&A deal in the quarter. This was followed by a $38.5 billion deal by German energy firm E.ON SE to acquire the renewable energy business of RWE Aktiengesellschaft.Despite the game-changing transactions, the quarter witnessed intense volatility in equity markets as U.S. President Trump imposed trade tariffs on Chinese goods. This perhaps robbed some companies suitable acquisition opportunities as corporate valuations remained high and management became more cautious to trade at inflated price levels.Regulatory risks also increased during the quarter as exemplified by the heightened threat perceived by the U.S. government in the proposed hostile bid by Singapore-based Broadcom Limited (AVGO  -  Free Report) for domestic chip-maker QUALCOMM Incorporated (QCOM  -  Free Report). The transaction was blocked on concerns of national security as government feared that it would lose its technological prowess to the Chinese counterparts.The quarter further witnessed uncertainty on antitrust activities as the U.S. Department of Justice thwarted the $85-billion deal by AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report) to acquire Time Warner Inc. . Concerns were raised about how the deal would affect two different sectors and the deal, therefore, was summarily rejected.Nonetheless, the first quarter made a perfect start to the year and is likely to give more firepower to the government as well as to top management of firms to pursue more strategic transactions and swim with the tide.Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio?Earlier this month, credit bureau Equifax announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of every 3 Americans.

2378,QCOM,"Shares of BlackBerry (BB  -  Free Report) dipped over 1.5% during morning trading on Tuesday, just one day before the former smartphone power is expected to report its latest quarterly financial results. After a rough few weeks of trading, investors will be on the lookout for strong earnings results, which means Wall Street will be focusing on BlackBerry when it reports Wednesday.BlackBerry’s days of dominating the smartphone market might be long gone, but the company has slowly and successfully transitioned into a cybersecurity software and services firm. Shares of BlackBerry have skyrocketed 84.6% over the last year as the fight against cyber attacks becomes an everyday battle.BlackBerry now works with some of the biggest names in tech, including Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report) and Baidu (BIDU  -  Free Report), and secured two notable contracts within the last week alone. The company will now provide cybersecurity services for luxury carmaker Jaguar Land Rover, as it makes a bigger connected vehicle push. Along with this deal, BlackBerry’s stock popped last week after the company announced it would provide security for Microsoft’s (MSFT  -  Free Report) flagship Office apps.With all of that said, investors have clearly loved BlackBerry stock over the last year as it moves into a new growth sector. But the firm’s stellar run could be dampened if it fails to impress in its soon-to-be-reported quarter. Let’s take a closer look.Latest Outlook Our Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for BlackBerry to post break-even earnings and revenues of $211.03 million. These results would represent year-over-year declines of 100% and 26.21%, respectively.Earnings ESP WhispersInvestors will also want to anticipate the likelihood that BlackBerry surprises investors with better-than-anticipated earnings results. For this, we turn to our Earnings ESP figure. Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst estimates. This is done because, generally speaking, when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat. In fact, our 10-year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70% of the time.BB is sporting a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This means we have seen no change in estimates leading up to the report. Based on this information, our model does not conclusively suggest that a surprise is in store.Price Performance and Surprise HistoryAnother important thing to consider ahead of BlackBerry’s report is the company’s history of earnings surprises and the effect that these surprises have had on share prices.BlackBerry Limited Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise BlackBerry Limited Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | BlackBerry Limited QuoteAs we can see, BlackBerry has a relatively strong earnings surprise history, but its bottom-line results have not always translated into upward momentum for the stock. Yet, the company has been on a solid run in terms of earnings performance over the last two years and posted massive beats in the trailing two quarters.We judge the price effect of these earnings beats by comparing the closing price of the stock two days before the report and two days after the report. BlackBerry’s stock surged 8.56% and 21.13%, respectively, over the last two quarters.As most investors know, past performance is no guarantee of future success, but we can see that investors have rewarded BlackBerry’s earnings beats recently. Along with that, BlackBerry stock has been on a strong run over the last year as the company becomes a force in the cybersecurity industry.  BlackBerry is expected to report its fiscal fourth quarter and full-year 2018 results before the opening bell on Wednesday, March 28.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

2379,QCOM,"Markets staged a powerful rebound on Monday after registering strong losses in the previous session, with stocks rising sharply, as tensions of an ensuing trade war between the United States and China appeared to ease. As a result all three major indices posting their best one-day percentage gains in more than two-and-a-half years. On the other hand, Facebook’s shares initially decline on news of the Federal Trade Commission investigating the company’s data practices, before closing 0.4% higher. How did the Benchmarks Fare?The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rallied 2.8%, or 669.4 points, to close at 24,202.60, its biggest single-day percentage gain since August 2015 and its third best point gain in history. The S&P 500 surged 2.7% to close at 2,658.55, nearing its 200-day moving average. The Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 7220.54, advancing 3.3%, with both Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Apple Inc.’s (AAPL  -  Free Report) shares increasing. Advancers outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 2.43-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 1.82-to-1 ratio favored advancing issues.Fears of U.S.-China Trade War EaseMarkets were gripped by fears of an ensuing trade war between the United States and China after President Donald Trump imposed tariffs of as much as $60 billion of Chinese imports. Consequently, China too announced plans for reciprocal tariffs on $3 billion of imports from the United States.However, the United States requested China to slash tariffs on U.S. autos, buy more semiconductors and give U.S firms more access to the Chinese financial sector, in a letter last week. Subsequently, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang came up with a positive response.On Monday, Keqiang said China would give equal treatment to both domestic and foreign companies. He also said that he won’t force foreign firms to enter into technology transfer agreements. China would also work toward strengthening intellectual property rights, Keqiang added.China has also expressed its desire to buy more semiconductors from the United States in order to help cut its trade surplus with the United States. As a result of these developments, all three major benchmarks postied their biggest single-day gains in more than two-and-a-half years. Shares of Qualcomm Incorporated (QCOM  -  Free Report) and Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report) increased 4.6% and 6.3%, respectively. Intel sports a Zacks Rank #1.

(FB  -  Free Report) fell once again on news that the Federal Trade Commission is investigating its privacy practices. However, the social media giant managed to bounce back and close 0.4% higher. Facebook has been weighing on the tech sector ever since the Cambridge Ananlytica data misuse scandal came to light last week. On Monday, Facebook’s stock hit a session low of $149, erasing its market capitalization by $100 billion in just a week.However, other tech stocks rebounded from the losses made in the previous session and were among the top performing industry groups on Monday. Shares of Microsoft Corporation (MSFT  -  Free Report) and Netflix, Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report) rallied 7.6% and 6.5%, respectively. Apple’s shares rose 4.8%, while Amazon jumped 4%. Financial shares also notched up strong gains with the Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF) up 3.3%. This represents its largest one-day gain since November 2016.

2380,QCOM,"With industry rivals AMD (AMD  -  Free Report) and Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report) posting their latest financial results on Wednesday afternoon, investor attention will now shift to semiconductor titan Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) and its first quarter fiscal 2018 report after the closing bell today. Concern that the strong run of the chip market could be nearing its cyclical end has lingered above the industry’s top players ahead of earnings season, but results and guidance have been decent so far.  AMD topped expectations on the top and bottom line while calling for Q2 revenues to fall well ahead of previous estimates. Meanwhile, Qualcomm posted its own double beat and guided for net sales to improve by up to 4% in the current quarter.So what should investors expect from Intel when it reports this afternoon? Well, the latest Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for Intel to report adjusted earnings of $0.71 per share and total revenue of $15.05 billion. These results would represent year-over-year growth rates of 7.6% and 1.7%, respectively. Of course, this is only part of the picture, and we can turn to our exclusive Zacks Consensus Non-Financial Metrics Estimates to better prepare for the report. The Zacks Consensus NFM file contains detailed estimate data for business segment metrics and non-financial metrics reported by companies. The data is acquired from digest and contributing broker models and includes the independent research of expert stock market analysts. Intel operates through a number of key business segments, and investors will likely want to know exactly how the company is doing in each of these. The largest of Intel’s individual units is its Client Computing Group, which brings under one roof its platform products for notebooks, 2-in-1s, ultrabooks, desktops, tablets and phones. Based on our latest consensus NFM estimates, we expect Intel to report total Client Computing Group revenues of $7.83 billion. This result would represent year-over-year growth of 5.9%. Intel actually reported a slight decrease in revenue for this unit last quarter, so growth of nearly 6% would certainly be welcomed by investors. Intel’s next largest segment is its Data Center Group. This unit deals with servers, workstations, and other products for data center and cloud computing environments. Our consensus estimates are calling for Intel to post Data Center revenues of $4.82 billion, which would mark growth of more than 13.9% from the year-ago period. Finally, the company’s third biggest unit in terms of revenue generation has historically been its Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group. According to our consensus estimates, analysts expect Intel to report segment revenues of $925 million in this unit, up modestly from about $866 million last year. Investors should note that Intel’s Internet of Things Group has also been a rapid grower and might surpass the NVMS Group soon. It is important to properly prepare for, and subsequently digest, massive earnings reports like that of Intel. As one of the world’s largest semiconductor manufacturers, Intel has its hands in nearly every corner of the chip market, and its segment results might help us understand what is hot and what is not in the industry. Want more market analysis from this author?

2383,QCOM,"Last week, I wrote about how Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report) softened its rejection of Broadcom’s (AVGO  -  Free Report) bid by meeting with its key people: Qualcomm Meets Broadcom After Rejecting Its Revised Offer. But the company reportedly hasn’t said much since then, either to Broadcom representatives or to the public. Its response has instead been to raise the offer for NXP Semiconductor (NXPI  -  Free Report) from $110 to $127.50 per share in cash.Raising the price irked Broadcom, which put out a statement saying, “Qualcomm’s board acted against the best interests of its stockholders by unilaterally transferring excessive value to NXP’s activist stockholders."" It has also said that it will reduce the cash portion of its own bid for Qualcomm by $3 if it buys NXP at the new price. It’s new offer for the company is $117 billion, reports Reuters.Qualcomm Needs to Buy NXPQualcomm may be able to close the deal at the new price, as it has now got agreements from nine big shareholders, including Eliott Managementand Soroban Capital Partners that had been pushing for a higher price. These investors together control a 28% stake. If 70% of the shares are tendered, Qualcomm can buy out the entire company in a two-step process as agreed with its board.If NXP shareholders don’t approve the deal, the company will pay $1.3 billion to Qualcomm as cancellation fee and if Qualcomm can’t find the resources or acquire the necessary government approval, it will have to pay NXP $2 billion (China’s MOFCOM is the only regulator left to approve the deal). At any rate, NXP share prices remain close to (slightly below) the revised offer price, so most investors seem happy with it.The financial considerations aside, NXP solves many problems for the leading mobile chip maker. The company is the leading supplier of automotive chips and has also built capabilities in IoT. Qualcomm on the other hand, leads in mobile chip technology and is attempting to make inroads into Intel’s computing territory. While the mobile phone market is slowing down, automotive and IoT applications, where Intel is building capabilities, represent growth opportunities for the company.There’s also been some talk about strained ties with its top customer Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), but Qualcomm is taking this one case at a time. In principle, Apple isn’t saying Qualcomm violated the law, but that the law needs to be changed because it unduly favors companies licensing IP on FRAND terms.The fact that Qualcomm withheld a billion dollars it promised Apple as rebate for using its chips exclusively is a different story. In the meantime, Qualcomm’s receivables are also increasing as Apple continues to use its technology without payment.While its dispute with Apple escalates, Qualcomm has managed to settle things in Korea with Samsung, the main plaintiff in the Korean FTC case. It’s of course unclear as of now, but Apple could find it more difficult to get the law changed if others across the industry don’t have issue with it. Notably, Qualcomm recently announced 5G partnerships with carriers and handset makers that included most of its current customers but not Apple.Why Broadcom Wants Qualcomm At AllBroadcom, on the other hand, has a great track record integrating acquisitions (although Qualcomm is by far the largest, so it will be that much harder). Its philosophy is to take out extra costs and increase efficiency of operations. In all probability this is what it wants to do with Qualcomm as well. Qualcomm’s licensing business is naturally high-margin but Broadcom may be able to reduce costs at the chip making division.The other thing it could do is agree to Apple’s demand that it pay lower royalties and thereby retain a key customer.ConclusionThe two companies don’t seem to operate at the same level. Broadcom is more about efficient operations (though Qualcomm’s IP won’t hurt of course). Qualcomm on the other hand is more aggressive; it has a good R&D team and wants to keep investing in it. It wants to go after markets that are likely to generate strong growth and it doesn’t mind taking a few risks.The kind of mindset that has driven Qualcomm’s success and likely will drive it going forward isn’t the same as the one driving Broadcom. But then Hock Tan has been exceptionally successful at integrations, so it could be a good combination, you never know.Qualcomm shares have a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

2384,QCOM,"Over the last five trading days, telecom stocks were initially slow off the blocks but gradually picked up pace, as protective measures by the U.S. government seemed to propel the industry to gain an upper hand over its Chinese counterparts.At a meeting held last week, the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) came up with a concrete date to auction licenses of high-band spectrum so that wireless networks could roll out 5G technology by the end of the year. The FCC voted unanimously to auction off licenses for the 28GHz spectrum on Nov 14, followed by another round for 24GHz spectrum soon after. The FCC expects to sell about 6,000 individual licenses for different chunks of spectrum in different geographic locations.The FCC also voted unanimously to finalize a plan this year to prevent federally subsidized telecommunications carriers from using suppliers deemed to pose a risk to the U.S. national security. The decision takes a swipe at Chinese telecom companies like Huawei and ZTE and intensifies the murky trade war between the two superpowers. The strategic plan aims to thwart the U.S. companies to utilize the $8.5 billion FCC Universal Service Fund to procure goods or services from Chinese firms, limiting the latter’s ability to sell their products in the country.Regarding company-specific news, the earnings season started off with ADTRAN Inc. (ADTN  -  Free Report) reporting results, while continued product launches for superior connectivity and high-quality content to subscribers at lower cost of ownership gained momentum over the last five trading days.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories1.    ADTRAN reported lackluster first-quarter 2018 results with both the top line and bottom line missing the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. Excluding non-recurring items, non-GAAP loss for the reported quarter was 29 cents per share against earnings of 18 cents in the year-earlier quarter and was wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 15 cents.Total revenues for the first quarter were $120.8 million compared with $170.3 million in the prior-year quarter. Also, the top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $126 million. The significant decline was primarily attributable to slowdown in the spending at a domestic Tier 1 customer (resulting in lower product volumes), high restructuring expenses and a merger-related review. (Read more: ADTRAN Q1 Loss Wider Than Expected on Revenue Decline)2.    In a deadly blow to QUALCOMM Incorporated (QCOM  -  Free Report), the U.S. government has banned sale of components by American firms to Chinese telecom equipment maker, ZTE Corp.Citing a breach of agreement inked last year, the U.S. Department of Commerce slapped a seven-year ban on sale of various components to ZTE after it was caught illegally shipping goods to Iran. The strategic move is likely to hit Qualcomm the most, as it accounts for the lion’s share of semiconductor chips used in ZTE smartphones. Consequently, the move could prove to be a boomerang for domestic manufacturers like Qualcomm. (Read more: Qualcomm's Revenues Might be Hit by Ban on Sales to ZTE)3.    In a concerted move to offer superior viewing experiences, Ericsson (ERIC  -  Free Report) announced the launch of its MediaFirst End-to-End Ultra High Definition solution. The innovative platform represents the industry's first software-based, multi-application media processing and encoding platform to deliver UHD content from camera to consumer, across the entire media delivery landscape.The new solution addresses the growing consumer need by enabling viewers to enjoy a better and more immersive viewing experience, even on larger TV sets. It has been designed from ground up to enable contribution workflows using Ericsson Media Solutions' advanced technology, leveraging high performance algorithms for encoding UHD content to be delivered across contribution networks. (Read more: Ericsson to Unveil MediaFirst End-to-End UHD Platform)4.    T-Mobile US, Inc. (TMUS  -  Free Report) was accused of failing to fix problems relating to phone calls in rural areas and using false ring tones, which were banned, to give the impression that the faulty calls were actually getting through.The company accepted the charges and acknowledged that false ring tones were used on hundreds of millions of long-distance rural calls in violation of FCC rules. T-Mobile has agreed to pay a fine of $40 million to the U.S. Treasury to resolve the dispute with the government. (Read more: T-Mobile Fined for False Ring Tones on Rural U.S. Calls)5.    Sprint Corporation (S  -  Free Report) recently announced the launch of Sprint Smart UC. Characterized by an affordable fully-featured unified communications solution, the Smart UC is powered by BroadSoft, Inc., which is part of Cisco Systems, Inc.  The Sprint Smart UC offers a robust work-from-anywhere solution that brings fully-integrated communication and collaboration services together. The solution can be seamlessly integrated into a Sprint-converged IT platform, comprising world-class wireless, wireline and IoT solutions with one point of contact. It is aimed at elevating employee collaboration and organizational communication. (Read more: Sprint Unveils Smart UC to Elevate Employee Collaboration)Price PerformanceThe following table shows the price movement of some the major telecom stocks over the past week and during the last six months.In the last five trading days, Harris Corporation (HRS  -  Free Report) was the major gainer with its share price rising 3.8% while Juniper Networks, Inc. (JNPR  -  Free Report) was the major loser, with its stock declining 1.3%.Over the last six months, Motorola Solutions, Inc. (MSI  -  Free Report) was the best performer with its stock appreciating 19.2%, while Sprint was the major decliner with its shares falling 15.5%.Over the last six months, the Zacks Telecommunications Services industry underperformed the benchmark S&P 500 index with an average decline of 1.4% against a gain of 5.9% for the latter.What’s Next in the Telecom Space?In addition to continued product launches and deployment of 5G technologies, all eyes will remain glued to major earnings releases of the sector next week, namely Ericsson, Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report), AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report) and Qualcomm.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

2385,QCOM,"Broadcom’s (AVGO  -  Free Report) $117 billion hostile bid for Qualcomm (read: Qualcomm Raises NXP Bid, Broadcom Responds) has raised a few red flags over at the White House. According to news reports, the government has asked and Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report) has agreed to postpone for 30 days its shareholders’ meeting (supposed to be held yesterday) where shareholders were expected to vote in favor of replacing its current board with Broadcom-selected directors.The deal is now up for national security review even before it has been signed in an unprecedented move by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). While Broadcom has said that it was engineered by Qualcomm, it’s worth noting that it has reportedly been working with CFIUS for the past year. The company now says that since it is bringing its headquarters back from Singapore to the U.S., it soon won’t be subject to CFIUS directions anyway. Why Is CFIUS Objecting?It appears that members of the Congress and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) are concerned that the emergence of Huawei as a major supplier of communications equipment and Broadcom’s chances of selling parts of Qualcomm to Huawei or another Chinese firm to bring down costs could see important communications technology get transferred to the Chinese.The treasury department under which CFIUS is organized has issued a letter pointing to the importance of having a well-known and trusted company “hold the dominant role that Qualcomm does in the U.S. telecommunications infrastructure.” Huawei already owns 10% of the patents for the 5G standard and if it could gain access to Qualcomm’s patents, this would significantly increase its share. “A shift to Chinese dominance in 5G would have substantial negative national security consequences for the United States,” the letter read.  Republican Senator John Cornyn also indicated in a letter to theTreasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin last week that in this context, Broadcom’s determination to take over Qualcomm in a hostile bid appeared significant.ConclusionQualcomm is set to maintain dominance in the 5G standard, as it recently brought a large number of carriers and handset makers to adopt its technologies. It has also made peace with Samsung, a major customer that played a big role in its legal troubles with the Korean FTC.The company’s need for Broadcom isn’t clear because cost cutting isn’t going to help it stay at the leading edge. Senator Cornyn’s concerns seem justified under the circumstances.However, that doesn’t mean a deal won’t take place. As Broadcom pointed out, it may soon be outside CFIUS’s jurisdiction. It’s not exactly anti-competitive because the companies operate in adjacent but different segments of the semiconductor market.Moreover, customer losses, if they occur, will not be a problem for Qualcomm investors who are cashing out. While Qualcomm customers are concerned about the takeover, they may not be in a position to sway investor opinion if the deal is sweet enough for investors.The board has a big task ahead to convince the owners that the company is worth more than what Broadcom is willing to pay.Both Qualcomm and Broadcom shares carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Semiconductor stocks worth buying instead are Mellanox Technologies (MLNX  -  Free Report) with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), or Diodes (DIOD  -  Free Report), or Ichor Holdings (ICHR  -  Free Report), which have a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

2386,QCOM,"In a rare intervention by the government, the U.S. Treasury's Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) has outlined key concerns in a letter dated Mar 5, 2018 to both Broadcom Ltd. (AVGO  -  Free Report) and Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM  -  Free Report) related to their proposed merger deal. CFISU will closely review the deal and has asked Qualcomm to postpone shareholders' meeting for a month.The decision of the regulatory body is unprecedented in view of the fact that Broadcom’s proposed $117 billion (net of debt) bid for a hostile takeover of Qualcomm has not been finalized so far. The decision of the secretive government panel reflects an aggressive position by the administration to protect major American corporate names from being acquired by non-U.S. entities.Importantly, several U.S. tech giants have taken a stand on the deal. While Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) will be a beneficiary if the deal goes through, both Microsoft Corp. (MSFT  -  Free Report) and Google of Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL  -  Free Report) opposed the deal.U.S. Treasury Raises Several ConcernsFirst, while Qualcomm is U.S. mobile chipset giant and a global leader for setting wireless standards, Broadcom is based in Singapore, notwithstanding the fact that the company expressed its desire in last November to shift its legal headquarter to the United States.Second, Broadcom has a reputation of reducing R&D expenditures. Analysts have estimated that the company needs to raise more than $100 billion in debt to complete the proposed deal. Consequently, management may be tempted to cut R&D expenditures in order to service debt. Qualcomm generally spends more than 20% of its revenues on R&D every year.Third, massive investment in R&D is an integral part of Qualcomm to maintain its global leadership position in the smarphone chipset market.  Compromising Qualcomm's assets through arrangements with ""third party foreign entities,"" will significantly affect national security of the United States.The third party entities, especially, the Chinese tech giants like Huawei and ZTE may get access to Qualcomm’s precious patents from Broadcom or at least a stalled R&D activity may result in Qualcomm losing its competitive edge in the upcoming 5G wireless network standard to its Chinese counterparts. Qualcomm has issued and applied more than 130,000 patents primarily in smartphone areas.Both Broadcom and Qualcomm currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.  Winners and LosersIf the Broadcom-Qualcomm deal sees light of the day, smartphone giant Apple may be a major beneficiary. Qualcomm which provides chipset for iPhone and iPAD is currently engaged in $1 billion legal battle related to royalty payment with Apple. But Broadcom expressed desire to resolve the litigation amicably if the deal goes through.Meanwhile, Microsoft and Google of Alphabet have raised concern about the proposed merger. These two tech giants consider an independent Qualcomm as being more closely aligned with their interests than a Broadcom-owned Qualcomm.For Google, most of the Android-based smartphones and tablets run on Qualcomm’s chipset. Consequently, a decline in chipset standard will be detrimental to Google. Similarly, Microsoft recently unveils first Windows 10 OS based PCs using Qualcomm’s chipset.Telecom M&A to Become TougherThe decision will have a strong bearing on the merger and acquisition (M&A) activities in the telecom space.On one hand, President Trump has stated that he wants to do away with nearly 75% of all governmental regulations during his tenure. The telecom industry will be one of the major beneficiaries of this policy change. A new Federal Communications Commission (FCC), helmed by Ajit Pai, exercising lesser restrictions, certainly augurs well for the telecom industry.On the other hand, a sheer protectionist strategy like national security reflects growing concern by Trump administration over the flurry of deals in the United States by foreign companies.The government seems highly concerned about the fact that United States may lose its edge in areas like technology and telecom to China and other Asian countries. In recent months, CFIUS has blocked takeover deals of U.S. companies MoneyGram and Lattice Semiconductor by Chinese counterparts.Importantly, In January 2018, security officials of Trump administration have considered the prospect of the government building its own 5G network to combat China’s economic and cyber threat.Bottom LineWhile the U.S. tech industry is divided about the potential impact of the Broadcom-Qualcomm deal, the U.S. government expressed severe concern about the potential risk of an unnamed actor, possibly Huawei, working through Broadcom to hurt U.S. national security.While Apple stands to gain from the deal, Microsoft and Alphabet could lose out if it goes through. This explains their opposing stands on the issue even as the fate of this key deal hangs in the balance.Breaking News: Cryptocurrencies Now Bigger than VisaThe total market cap of all cryptos recently surpassed $700 billion – more than a 3,800% increase in the previous 12 months.

2387,QCOM,"The U.S. telecom industry remained rather subdued last week. Very few developments took place in the Christmas/New Year week. We will briefly mention those events.Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report), Ericsson AB (ERIC  -  Free Report) and Qualcomm Technologies, Inc., a subsidiary of Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM  -  Free Report), recently completed the first successful FDD (Frequency Division Duplexing) Massive MIMO (Multiple Input-Multiple Output) trial with a fully-compatible customer device.The trial was completed using Ericsson’s latest Massive MIMO software and hardware and Verizon’s wireless network on a mobile test device. The test device was powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 chipset (which was equipped with the X20 LTE modem). The modem supports the Transmission Mode 9 (TM9) technology which is compatible with Massive MIMO. The tests were conducted in Irvine, CA.Windstream Holdings Inc. (WIN  -  Free Report) has inked a deal to acquire MassComm, Inc., a privately held, New York-based competitive local exchange carrier (CLEC). The proposed deal will be an all-cash transaction, wherein the leading local exchange carrier will purchase all the issued and outstanding shares of MassComm. On completion, MassComm will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Windstream.Liberty Interactive Corp.’s  QVC division recently completed the acquisition of the remaining 61.8% of the home-shopping platform HSN Inc. in an all-stock deal worth $2.1 billion. The newly combined company will have $14 billion in revenues and 23 million customers across the world.The merged entity will result in the third-largest online site, behind Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc.’s (WMT  -  Free Report) e-commerce business. Liberty Interactive currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Meanwhile, Liberty Global plc (LBTYA  -  Free Report) also completed the spin-off of its Latin American and Caribbean operations into a new, independent, publicly traded company, Liberty Latin America Ltd., which was previously a unit of Liberty Global under the LiLAC Group. The spin-off transformed each share of the LiLAC Group tracking stock into equity shares of the new company’s common stock.In a separate development, Altice USA Inc. (ATUS  -  Free Report) and Starz Inc. reportedly failed to ink a new programming deal on the New Year’s Eve. This led to the blackout of 17 Starz, StarzEncore and MoviePlex premium channels in Altice USA’s Optimum and Suddenlink cable TV services.Read the last Telecom Stock Roundup for Dec 27, 2017.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories  1.    Massive MIMO is a vital component of 4G LTE Advancements and is likely to play a major role in the evolution of 5G technology. Accordingly, the deployment of Massive MIMO antenna setups will prepare the network for the upcoming next-generation 5G deployment. With TM9 functionality, Massive MIMO has the potential to improve the performance of the LTE network, maintain signal stability and thus enhance overall customer experience with higher speeds.

Also, the programs are available directly through Starzs' own OTT service. On the other hand, Starz blamed Altice USA of demanding a drastic reduction in carriage price, compared with the market. The failure to ink a new carriage deal implies tense talks between the companies over how much the cable operator should pay to continue offering the premium channels to customers.

2388,QCOM,"Shares of BlackBerry (BB  -  Free Report), the mobile phone maker turned software provider, climbed more than 5% in morning trading Wednesday after the company announced it will work with internet giant Baidu (BIDU  -  Free Report) on a self-driving car project.BlackBerry management said today that Baidu will use its QNX Hypervisor 2.0 software, which is designed for complex in-vehicle computer systems, in the Chinese firm’s open-source self-driving platform, Apollo.“By integrating the BlackBerry QNX OS with the Apollo platform, we will enable carmakers to leap from prototype to production systems,” added Li Zhenyu, head of Baidu’s intelligent driving division.BlackBerry joins a growing list of tech companies that have contributed to Apollo. Last summer, Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) announced that its Azure cloud platform would help Apollo’s reach outside of China, making it one of roughly 50 brands working on the project.“Our goal with Apollo is to provide an open and powerful platform to the automotive industry to further the goal of autonomous vehicles,” Baidu president Ya-Qin Zhang said at the time (also read: Microsoft & Baidu Partner On Autonomous Cars).Other notable companies that have collaborated with Baidu include Nvidia (NVDA  -  Free Report), Bosch (BOCH  -  Free Report), and Continental.For BlackBerry, the new partnership is one of several that it has formed in the growing self-driving car market. The software firm has also signed deals to work with chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report), as well as auto tech companies Aptiv (APTV  -  Free Report) and Denso (DNZOY  -  Free Report).“The opportunity is global, it’s for a very large market and I think it’s a very solid win for BlackBerry,” CIBC Capital Markets analyst Todd Coupland, via Reuters.Want more stock market analysis from this author?

2389,QCOM,"Per a FierceWireless report, the United States’ government — through its Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) — has finally intervened into Broadcom’s (AVGO  -  Free Report) proposed $117 billion hostile takeover offer of Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report). CFIUS is an inter-agency committee of the U.S. government that reviews the national security implications of foreign investments in U.S. companies or operations.Per a recent CFIUS order, Qualcomm has postponed its 2018 annual shareholders’ meeting from Mar 6 to Apr 5. The delayed meeting gives each side a chance to present its case to Qualcomm shareholders. Meanwhile, CFIUS will also investigate and review the proposed takeover deal by Broadcom.The government has raised concerns that the proposed takeover is likely to raise national security issues and potentially affect the United States’ role in the development of 5G wireless network technology, as China is forging ahead to take a lead in the space.Broadcom’s Efforts and Threats from ChinaBroadcom has been trying for the past three-four months to takeover Qualcomm with its multiple bids. On Nov 6, 2017, Broadcom initially offered $70 per share, of which $60 was to be paid in cash and the rest in shares. The revised offer, which is Broadcom’s ""best and final offer,"" values each share at $82 ($60 a share in cash and the rest in shares).However, Broadcom’s attempts to acquire Qualcomm for creating a wireless powerhouse was thwarted again when its revised bid was rejected unanimously by Qualcomm’s board of directors, on grounds of inadequacy and potential antitrust hurdles.Since this is an unsolicited, hostile bid to take control of the company, Broadcom is also looking to replace the entire Qualcomm board with 11 people of its own choosing.Moreover, if Broadcom is successful in acquiring Qualcomm, it is expected to break up Qualcomm and sell the pieces to a Chinese firm. Thus, national wireless carriers would be left with no choice other than buying Chinese equipment.This could potentially affect the U.S. position in the emerging market for 5G services, thus paving the way for Chinese companies to gain an upper hand in the sector. The U.S. market will be left with only some of the small existing number of equipment suppliers.Consequently, if Broadcom succeeds in the takeover, it might be a major loss to the nation. On the other hand, Broadcom’s successful takeover of Qualcomm might also be the biggest tech deal. The proposed combination of Broadcom and Qualcomm may create the world's third-largest semiconductor company, lagging Intel Corp. (INTC  -  Free Report) and Samsung.The semiconductor industry is locked up in a race of mergers and acquisitions. We currently await updates on this front as to which side the CFIUS decision turns up.Price PerformanceIn the past six months, Qualcomm performed pretty well. Shares of Qualcomm have soared 27.1% outpacing the industry’s rally of 16.9%. Zacks Rank & Stock to ConsiderQualcomm carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2392,QCOM,"President Donald Trump has announced tariffs on $60 billion worth of Chinese imports, kicking off what may turn into a trade war between the two countries. This, it should be mentioned, is a fraction of the $500 billion worth of goods the U.S. imports from China.The President’s action is based on findings that forced transfer (by theft and otherwise) of American intellectual property by the Chinese is now valued at $48 billion a year, up from earlier estimates of around $30 billion a year. It also takes into consideration the fact that China blocks a large number of U.S. companies, including technology firms and credit card companies, from operating in the country.Citing Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, the President’s memorandum directed the government to take action. These actions are higher tariffs on items that the government will specify in 15 days and U.S. industry will have another 15 days to submit comments on before they go into effect.The list of products to be impacted hasn’t been named yet, but they will reportedly cover 1,300 product categories that will be subject to a 25% tariff. Informal comments from government officials indicate that they will target the high tech industries China is trying to build (China earlier named 10 industries including information technology, advanced industrial equipment, biopharmaceuticals, green energy and aerospace as focus areas for its ‘Made in China 2025’ initiative). Yahoo Finance columnist Rick Newman speculates that the Trump tariffs could follow the same blueprint for maximum effect.Trump wants China to cut the country’s $375 billion merchandise trade deficit with China by $100 billion.Chinese Ambassador to the U.S. Cui Tiankai says that the U.S hasn’t specified what it wants and has instead suspended formal trade talks. And while China doesn’t “want a trade war,” it “is not afraid of it. If somebody tries to impose a trade war on us, we will certainly fight back and retaliate.”What China Could Do in RetaliationThe Chinese could do a lot of damage, both to certain industries and to Trump’s position at the White House, as he contests the mid-terms later this year. On the other hand, Chinese President Xi Jinping has avoided the election process and has got no one to please but the communist party he represents. So while he can take actions that will be temporarily difficult on Chinese people, Trump may be able to do it only at the cost of his own office. Which wouldn’t solve the problem.So when Trump announced the tariffs on steel and aluminum (and America largely doesn’t even buy steel from China), the Chinese Commerce Ministry responded within a week with increased tariffs on $3 billion of U.S. goods including a 25% tariff on U.S. pork imports and 15% tariff on American steel pipes, fruit and wine. China has said it will go through the World Trade Organization (WTO) process, which could mean trouble for the U.S. because some industry experts think that the U.S. doesn’t have the right to take such action.The stakes are obviously much higher this time, so the sanctions could hit soybeans, sorghum, live hogs and Boeing planes, which are also major Chinese imports.The non-diversified farming states where Trump scored most of his victories (reportedly eight of the top 10 soy and hog-producing states, and seven of the top 10 sorghum states) will be the worst affected, which can also tip the scales against him.China has also hinted that the trade deficit problem can be fixed with U.S. export of high tech equipment, which of course isn’t a solution because it will lead to even more theft and strengthening of China versus the U.S.   U.S. Markets to Face the BacklashThe technology supply chain that will be affected by the trade war won’t just affect China and the United States. There will be implications for South Korea, Japan, Taiwan and others. And the U.S. may be able to rally support from Canada and Mexico by softening its stand on NAFTA and also with the EU and Australia because all are affected by Chinese steel overcapacity.Live Hogs: As far as the live hog market is concerned, China has been preparing for this contingency. It has for some time been the largest importer of hogs, especially from the U.S.But of late, record high hog prices have enabled Chinese companies to build very large farms with state of the art machinery and disease control and waste management systems. Last year, the government also cracked down on small farmers that couldn’t invest adequately in waste disposal systems. This sent many of the small farmers out of business while strengthening the position for larger farmers. China has been using superior genes from British, French and American breeds and building its large farms on U.S. prototypes.It’s expected that in the next few years, China will be able to meet its own pork requirement and also export surplus. So while the live hog market in the U.S. could face some backlash from these sanctions, it won’t be long before they see a drop in demand anyway. This may in fact be the last time that this is used as leverage in negotiations.Soybeans: The hog market is closely linked with the soy market because soybeans being high in protein are widely used to feed the pigs.This is probably why Bunge Ltd (BG  -  Free Report), the largest dealer in soybeans for animal feed, saw its shares plunge 5.2% so far in March.For soybean farmers in the U.S., things don’t look so good. Not only will they be affected by weak hog production in the U.S., but if China doesn’t buy from them to feed their own pigs (or make edible oil), there will be weak demand all round.The Chinese are in conversations with Argentina and Brazil for soybean imports that they might supplement or replace U.S. production with. Notably, both these countries have been granted temporary exemption from Trump’s recently-announced steel and aluminum tariffs. A prolonged drought in soybean producing areas of Argentina may further support U.S. actions.Sorghum: Chinese customs data reportedly shows that 4.76 million tons of the total 5 million tons of sorghum imported by China in 2017 came from the U.S. This is another grain used as cattle feed in China that farmers can get relatively cheap. It is also used to make a popular Chinese liquor.Possibly in reaction to the Trump administration’s tariff on Chinese solar panels and washing machines, last month, the Chinese government initiated an investigation into sorghum imports to see if there was “dumping” at subsidized rates. The investigation will be carried out for the period from November 1, 2016 to October 31, 2017. An investigation of industrial injury will be for the period from January 1, 2013 to October 31, 2017, according to a statement from the Chinese commerce ministry.This isn’t the first time that China has tried taking action against U.S. agricultural products. Last year, it levied anti-dumping and countervailing duties on distiller grain imports of 42.2%-53.7% and 11.2%-12.0% from January 12, 2017 for 5 years.Aerospace-Defense: The broader defense-aerospace market may not be as affected as Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) because of its growing dependence on China and the fact that China is currently its largest customer. Last year, during the President’s visit to China, the company announced a $37 billion order for 300 aircraft.Last September, Boeing forecasted that China would buy a trillion dollars’ worth of planes over the next 20 years. Boeing has admitted that China is growing into the largest market for aircraft and that one in every four planes it produces goes to China.Technology: Some have argued that Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), because its phones are assembled in China, alone accounts for a large chunk of the $ trade deficit with China. But IHS Markit estimates its total components cost at $370.25, of which $110 goes to South Korea’s Samsung Electronics for displays, $44.45 goes to Japan's Toshiba Corp and South Korea's SK Hynix for memory chips with the remaining split between various suppliers inTaiwan, Europe and the U.S. and China’s labor contractors, which account for only around 3-6% of the value.As Adam Jourdan of Reuters points out, “Using a rough calculation…the iPhone 7 series added $15.7 billion to the U.S. trade deficit with China last year, about 4.4 percent of the total. That's also about 22 percent of the $70 billion in cell phones and household goods the U.S. imported from China.”HP (HPQ  -  Free Report), Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) and Cisco (CSCO  -  Free Report) are other technology companies likely to be affected by a trade war. Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report) has even more to lose than just trade as Chinese regulators are the only ones remaining to approve its NXP Semiconductor (NXPI  -  Free Report) buyout.Last WordAmericans will of course see rising prices on any items that include components from China (the government is increasing tariffs on 1,300 items after all!). So anything from shoes to electronics to furniture could soon be more expensive.There is this huge argument about the wisdom of using tariffs that increase hardships for your own people and there’s some merit in that too. But one does wonder what else can be done under the circumstances, when previous administrations have done what they could without changing anything with respect to Chinese intellectual property theft, blocking of U.S. companies like Facebook, Twitter and Google in China and reducing its dependence on the U.S. all the while.China’s communist government is building a capitalist state. It will do everything possible to get there so the Chinese can compete effectively with everyone else. Until that happens, it will continue to use its population as leverage in negotiations. It’s time to call their bluff.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

2395,QCOM,"Shares of Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report) opened lower on Tuesday, only one day before the chip maker is scheduled to release its quarterly financial report. This dip is part of a much more worrisome decline over the last 12 weeks. But Qualcomm could turn things around if the company posts strong quarterly results.Qualcomm stock has tanked nearly 25% since January, as fears that an escalating trade war between the U.S. and China could leave the company caught in the crossfire. The tech giant is also currently embroiled in a tough legal battle with Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report).With that said, first quarter earnings season has helped lift the market, with fellow technology powers Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report) impressing investors already.Therefore, investors should take a chance to look at some of Qualcomm’s current quarterly estimates to see if the stock might be worth buying ahead of earnings, even if the company’s long-term future looks somewhat uncertain.Latest Outlook & ValuationOur current Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for Qualcomm’s revenues to reach $5.2 billion, which would mark a 3.7% climb from the year-ago period. On the other end of the income statement, Qualcomm’s quarterly earnings are projected to plummet 47.8% to hit $0.70 per share.Of course, top and bottom line growth estimates are just two of the many things investors will be concerned with when Qualcomm reports its second quarter 2018 financial results on Wednesday. We can also turn to our exclusive non-financial metrics consensus estimate file to help prepare.The Zacks Consensus NFM file contains detailed estimate data for business segment metrics and non-financial metrics reported by companies. The data is acquired from digest and contributing broker models and includes the independent research of expert stock market analysts.According to these consensus estimates, Qualcomm is projected to ship 182 million MSM chips. This would mark just a 1.7% climb from the year-ago period, for one of the company’s biggest business units. Investors should also note that Qualcomm shipped 237 million and 217 million MSM chips, respectively, in the trailing two quarters.Heading into Tuesday, Qualcomm was trading with a Forward P/E of 17.1, which marked a discount compared to the “Wireless Equipment” industry’s average of 21.1. With that said, the company is currently offering investors a bit of value against its median Forward P/E of 18.9. And due to the major selloff, Qualcomm is currently trading well below the 23x forward earnings it was trading at in late February.Earnings ESP WhispersInvestors will also want to understand what chance Qualcomm has to surprise investors with better-than-expected earnings results. For this, we turn to our Earnings ESP figure.Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst estimates. This is done because, generally speaking, when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat. In fact, our 10-year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70% of the time.Qualcomm is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and sports an Earnings ESP of -3.12%. The company’s Most Accurate Estimate—the representation of the most recent analyst sentiment—calls for earnings of $0.67 per share, which comes in 3 cents below our current consensus estimate. Therefore, QCOM is a stock that could fall short of quarterly earnings estimates.Surprise HistoryQualcomm’s earnings surprise history and the effect that these surprises have had on its share prices are two other important factors to consider ahead of the chip maker’s earnings report.QUALCOMM Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise QUALCOMM Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | QUALCOMM Incorporated QuoteWe can see that Qualcomm has posted strong earnings results recently, posting an average earnings surprise of 8.54% in the trailing four periods. However, these beats haven’t always led to positive momentum immediately following Qualcomm’s quarterly earnings release.We judge the price effect of these earnings beats by comparing the closing price of the stock two days before the report and two days after the report. Qualcomm stock has turned negative in five out of these last six windows.Qualcomm is scheduled to report its quarterly financial results after market close on Wednesday, April 25.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

2396,QCOM,"Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report), a multinational semiconductor and telecommunications equipment firm, saw its shares drop 4.5% on Thursday. The company has had problems closing a deal with NXP (NXP  -  Free Report), a Dutch semiconductor company, forcing them to withdraw and refile a previously set merger application with Chinese authorities.Qualcomm is currently awaiting approval from China, the last of the required global regulators, to move through with the merger.Meanwhile, news of up to 1,500 layoffs as a means to save money has spawned doubt and rattled investors. Along with this, increased competition with Broadcam (AVGO  -  Free Report), another chip manufacturing company, has shaken previous confidence in the company.This announcement and subsequent drop on the day is sticking true to the trend for Qualcomm in recent months. Year to date, shares have dropped 20.7%, mostly as a result of this failed merger and its consequences.Although the stock has steadily declined, it might still be attractive to some investors. But with “C” grades for Value and Growth in our Style Scores system, Qualcomm shares look shaky for a few reasons.The company’s P/E of 16.5 and P/CF of 11.5 beat industry averages, but its P/B ratio of 3.4 is almost twice the average of its industry. In similar fashion, while the company has cash flow of $4.80 per share—almost four times the industry average—it also holds a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.8, which is a significant premium to the industry average. This discrepancy is what leads to Qualcomm’s average grade for Value.And if potential investors were looking for strong analyst opinions, they would be met with disappointment. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Qualcomm’s full-year earnings has moved just a penny higher over the past 60 days, while our consensus projection for its next fiscal year has actually moved a penny lower over that time.Bottom LineQualcomm has been struggling in the stock market since the start of this year. A gradual decline in the midst of merger complications, layoffs, and lack of public confidence has hurt the company over the past few months, especially today.While there are some positive numbers that support respectable Value and Growth, they are counteracted by statistics that negate the same measures. Overall, mixed analyst sentiment has caused this stock to receive a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

2397,QCOM,"Qualcomm’s (QCOM  -  Free Report) proposed acquisition of NXP Semiconductor (NXPI  -  Free Report) has hit a roadblock with the Chinese Ministry of Communications (MOFCOM) saying that Qualcomm must make more concessions for local players. Qualcomm resubmitted a revised proposition this week, giving the government another 180 days to decide.While deteriorating U.S.-China trade relations may be partly responsible for the Chinese government’s apathy, there are other important considerations.China’s stated goal is to become self-sufficient in chip production and the government also has some ambitious goals in self-driving technology, artificial intelligence and mobile. As a result, it has invested billions of dollars into homegrown companies and the kind of educational institutions that will churn out very high volumes of researchers.Naturally, the government won’t do anything to upset its plans, and certainly not anything that will strengthen international players vis-a-vis the local players it has so painstakingly grown. So when those local players petition the government that they will be adversely impacted by the deal, especially in the areas of self-driving cars and mobile payments, there’s no way the government won’t take notice.In Qualcomm’s case, it’s more about expansion into emerging markets like self-driving cars and IoT at a time when growth in its core mobile phone business is declining. True that it has a leading share of the standard essential patents in 5G and is already partnered with most handset makers and telecoms for the standard. But this may not in itself satisfy investors given its already-leading position in the slowing market. And particularly since its fallout with Apple means a necessarily negative impact.   Qualcomm also has another problem: in defending its stand against Broadcom’s (AVGO  -  Free Report) hostile takeover, the company has touted its 5G strength and growth prospects resulting from the NXP acquisition. Now if the deal doesn’t go through as planned, investors might actually go ahead and replace the board as Broadcom threatened to do earlier. So for Qualcomm it’s an existential issue.The Chinese government is likely to take its time and whether or not the deal goes through as planned by yearend depends entirely on the concessions Qualcomm has agreed to this time. Qualcomm and Broadcom have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) while NXP has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). So it’s better to take a look at the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here instead.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

2398,QCOM,"Although most of the major telecom stocks lost value last week, the sector was witness to a number of important events. Notable among the many developments is mobile chipset giant Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM  -  Free Report) coming up with a better-than expected outlook for revenues and profit margins for 2019. Adjusted profit per share is estimated in the range of $6.75-$7.50. Revenues are forecast in the range of $35-$37 billion.Qualcomm plans to achieve the profit target through its new $1-billion cost reduction plan, gains from the NXP Semiconductors NV (NXPI  -  Free Report) deal and by resolving current licensing disputes, especially with Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report). Excluding royalty revenues and certain product revenues from Apple and other licensing disputes, Qualcomm expects to earn $5.25 in 2019.Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report) is reportedly planning to launch a theme-based online streaming TV service in 2018. The U.S. telecom behemoth will offer channels based on themes like news, sports and entertainment. All these channels will be offered as a standalone application. The content is likely to come from Oath properties like TechCrunch, Engadget, Huffington Post and premium content from third-party sources.Also, AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report) recently finalized a year-long pending deal with the Communications Workers of America (CWA) related to AT&T Mobility Orange unit employees.

The deal also includes wage hikes, healthcare benefits, employment security for call center and retail sales employees, and retirement benefits comprising pension and savings plan.Leading wireless tower operator Crown Castle International Corp. (CCI  -  Free Report) is reportedly planning to unite its fiber operations/assets under the Lightower brand. The merged entity is likely to form a well-established brand and network. It will revamp Crown Castle’s position as one of the largest fiber network operators in the nation. The company has been continuously trying to reposition itself from a tower operator to a fiber provider (focused on the small cell opportunity), through the purchase of several fiber operators.In a separate development, Comcast Corp. (CMCSA  -  Free Report), the biggest cable multi-service operator (MSO) in the U.S., is reportedly being slapped with patent infringement charges by TiVo Corporation (TIVO  -  Free Report) in relation to its X1 platform. The suit claims that Comcast’s X1 set-top boxes are infringing on at least eight of the patents, which are held by Rovi Corp. Notably, TiVo was acquired by Rovi in 2016 and the merged entity is known as TiVo, which attained ownership of more than 6,000 patents.Outside the United States, Nokia Corp. (NOK  -  Free Report) entered into a five-year deal with Optus to manage its mobile network infrastructure, operations and field maintenance. Nokia will provide network operations and software services to help the Australian telecom operator scale its network, which includes deploying robotics, artificial intelligence and extreme automation. The two companies will also work together to develop a network operations centre. Nokia carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2399,QCOM,"The fourth quarter of 2017 earnings has just begun with few companies reporting their results. Moreover, earnings releases are scattered in this quarter. However, the earnings calendar is not the same for all companies.One such stock is Qualcomm Inc (QCOM  -  Free Report), which is expected to release first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Oct 31, 2018, after the market closes.2017 has been a mixed year for the leading wireless chipset manufacturer. Qualcomm has been trying to retain its leadership in 5G, chipset market and mobile connectivity with multiple technological achievements and launches. On the flip side, the company has been involved in various legal brawls related to unfair business practices or licensing royalty payments.2018 seems to be a booming year for Qualcomm as the stock is soaring high. Shares of Qualcomm rose 4.48% to $68.25 on Jan 16.The stock soared on the back of the following crucial factors —lofty revenues, profit outlook for 2019, an alternative share buyback plan if bid to acquire NXP Semiconductors NV (NXPI  -  Free Report) fails, cost reduction plans and expected earnings/savings by resolving current licensing disputes.Notably, Qualcomm is striving to win back shareholders’ support on the back of the aforementioned strategies, to reject the hostile takeover bid from Broadcom Limited (AVGO  -  Free Report).Let’s have a closer view on each of the aforementioned factorsHiked Guidance for 2019Qualcomm unveiled a better-than expected outlook for revenues and profit margins for 2019. Adjusted profit per share is estimated in the range of $6.75-$7.50. Revenues are forecast in the rangeof $35-$37 billion. Per a Thomson Reuters report, the numbers have topped analyst’s estimates of a profit of $3.79 on revenues of $23.59 billion.The company plans to achieve the profit target through its new $1-billion cost reduction plan, gains from the NXP Semiconductors deal and by resolving current licensing disputes, especially with Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report). Excluding royalty revenues and certain product revenues from Apple and other licensing disputes, Qualcomm expects to earn $5.25 in 2019.NXP Buyout or Share Buyback: What’s Ahead?Announced in October 2016, Qualcomm is closer to the proposed acquisition of Netherlands-based mobile chipset giant NXP Semiconductors N.V. The combined entity is likely to generate annual revenues of more than $30 billion. Further, it will reinstate the merged entity as a strong player in the next-generation mobile chipset segment with a potential market size of $138 billion by 2020.Per the deal, Qualcomm will pay $110 per NXP Semiconductor share in cash, which includes an enterprise value of approximately $47 billion (equity value of $39 billion). So far, the deal has already received approval from the Taiwan Fair Trade Commission and the retail shareholders of NXP Semiconductors.However, the deal is under a thorough investigation by the telecom regulatory body of the European Union, the European Commission (EC). To get through EC, Qualcomm has revised its proposed deal to takeover NXP Semiconductors. Also, the company extended the offering period of its previously announced cash tender offer of purchasing all the outstanding common shares of NXP Semiconductors.Moreover, the deal is currently facing strong opposition from the institutional shareholders of NXP semiconductors. To this end, Qualcomm has chalked huge share buyback plans to enhance shareholders' wealth, as an alternative option if the pending deal does not go through. Let’s wait and see what is ahead for the year-long pending deal.Cost-Cutting PlansQualcomm claims to have saved around $1.4 billion through its previous cost-cutting plan announced in July 2015. Moreover, the company is planning to organize a new $1-billion cost reduction plan. The company aims to reduce expenses in four main areas, including selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A). The company is also hopeful about some of its 5G technology investments which will strategically lower spending in research and development.Zacks Rank & Price Performance Qualcomm currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Qualcomm has been portraying an impressive price performance in the past six months. Shares of Qualcomm returned 21.3% outpacing the industry’s rally of 10.5%. When compared with the market at large, the stock looks good compared with S&P500 index’s gain of 12.8%.Our ConcernsQualcomm’s improved guidance and cost cutting plans for 2019 look impressive. The targets are highly dependent on the deployment and launch of the next-generation 5G networks. Moreover, Qualcomm’s updated Snapdragon processors and applications have helped the company retain leadership in the global wireless baseband chipset market. The company has been working hard to retain its leadership in 5G, chipset market and mobile connectivity.5G wireless network along with fully compatible devices is expected to be launched by 2020. It is yet to be seen whether the company succeeds in achieving its hefty targets.Meanwhile, there is no possibility of a near-term settlement between Qualcomm and Apple, since no such initiatives are being undertaken by the companies. However, Qualcomm is expected to seek a quick settlement as the dispute with Apple and other licensee disputes have affected the company’s third and fourth quarters and fiscal 2017 GAAP and Non-GAAP results.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions. Apple sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years, creating a $1.7 trillion market.

2400,QCOM,"Comcast Corp. (CMCSA  -  Free Report), the leading cable multi-service operator (MSO) in the U.S., has been reportedly slapped with patent infringement charges by TiVo Corporation (TIVO  -  Free Report) in relation to its X1 platform. The suit claims that Comcast’s X1 set-top boxes are infringing on at least eight of the patents, which are held by Rovi Corp.TiVo was acquired by Rovi in 2016 and the merged entity is known as TiVo, which attained ownership over more than 6,000 patents.The patents that TiVo is using to accuse Comcast include features like pausing and resuming programs on multiple devices, DVR recording and additional advanced DVR features, advanced search and voice functionality, and restarting live shows, among others. Two cases were filled by the company, one in a California federal court and another in Massachusetts.Troubles for Comcast do not end here. Rovi plans to file an additional legal action against Comcast over the same patents with the U.S. International Trade commission (ITC). In fact, it will be seeking an exclusion order from the ITC to stop Comcast from importing X1 set-top boxes with the allegedly infringing technologies.Notably, this is not the first time that the companies have been engaged in such legal brawls. In November 2017, the ITC had ordered an import ban on Comcast’s X1 boxes for violating two of TiVo’s patents.Let’s wait and see in whose favor the decision turns out this time.Similar Patent SuitsPatent licensing disputes arenot new in the United States.The most hyped-up dispute in the industry is the $1 billion lawsuit related to licensing royalty payments, filed by Apple Inc (AAPL  -  Free Report) against Qualcomm Inc (QCOM  -  Free Report), in January 2017. The battle is still on with a series of counter attacks from either sides and is getting uglier day-by-day.On Nov 30, 2017, Qualcomm filed three new patent infringement complaints against Apple. Per Qualcomm, another 16 of its patents were being used by Apple in its iPhones. Notably, the three cases were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California in San Diego. This was in response to Apple’s counterattack against Qualcomm on Nov 29, 2017.Zacks Rank & Price Performance Comcast carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2402,QCOM,"Autonomous vehicles were all the rage last year, and this trend is set to continue in 2018 as the possibility of mass-produced self-driving cars inches closer to becoming a reality.Even though roads full of self-driving cars likely won’t be seen for some time, companies that are serious about thriving when drivers are no longer needed must spend money and focus on that future today.Technology giant Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report) and its autonomous car firm Waymo are helping lead this charge, along with ride sharing power Uber. Automotive companies including General Motors (GM  -  Free Report), Hyundai  and countless other carmakers are also heavily invested in self-driving vehicle technology.With this said, let’s take a look at three companies playing prominent roles in the autonomous vehicle revolution that are also looking like great buys right now:1.      Ford (F  -  Free Report)This U.S. automotive giant presented its vision of the future at CES on Tuesday. Ford’s “City of Tomorrow” plan includes a vision for connected cities, where vehicles, pedestrians, and traffic lights remain in constant contact in order to create a safer travel experience.Ford also announced partnerships with Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report), Argo AI, Domino’s Pizza (DPZ  -  Free Report), Lyft, and Postmates to help improve its own self-driving business. The company already has more than 700,000 connected vehicles on the road and plans to sell nothing but connected vehicles in the U.S. by next year (also read: Buy Ford (F  -  Free Report) After 'City of Tomorrow' Unveil At CES).Currently, Ford is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and sports an overall “A” VGM score. Ford’s 0.34 P/S and 1.57 P/B ratio mark substantial discounts compared to the “Automotive – Domestic” industry average. What’s more, the historic automaker, with its sights set on the future, is currently trading at just 8.53x earnings.2.       Nvidia (NVDA  -  Free Report)Nvidia just recently announced its new augmented reality, driverless car technology called “Nvidia Dive AR.” Nvidia has also announced partnerships with Volkswagen (VLKAY  -  Free Report) and Uber that will see the chipmaker bring its AI tech to the auto companies’ respective self-driving car projects. Furthermore, this Wall Street A-Lister’s DRIVE PX AI car computer is designed to help a wide range of companies produce automated and autonomous vehicles.Nvidia is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and sports an “A” grade for Growth in our Style Scores system. The company’s stock price hit a new 52-week high on Monday after its CES presentation. Looking ahead, Nvidia is expected to see its sales jump 22.35% next quarter, while its earnings are projected to pop 16.16%, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates (also read: Why Nvidia Has Already Won CES 2018).3.       Toyota Motor Corporation (TM  -  Free Report)Toyota just recently introduced its new e-Palette autonomous vehicle concept at CES. The vehicle is an all-electric, driverless shuttle for commercial use that is set to debut at the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo. Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Pizza Hut (YUM  -  Free Report) have already partnered with Toyota’s e-Palette Alliance. This Japanese automotive power also unveiled a new Lexus autonomous test vehicle.Toyota is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and earned a “B” VGM grade, which was supported by its “A” grade for Value in our Style Scores system. The company is currently trading at just 11.17x earnings, which marks a discount compared to the S&P 500’s average.What’s more, Toyota’s P/S ratio of 0.77 helps demonstrate its strong value, while its 1.17 P/B ratio marks a discount against the “Automotive – Foreign” industry average. Shares of Toyota jumped to close at a new 52-week high on Wednesday as it builds momentum from its recent self-driving announcements.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

2403,QCOM,"In a deadly blow to QUALCOMM Incorporated (QCOM  -  Free Report), the U.S. government has banned sale of components by American firms to Chinese telecom equipment maker, ZTE Corp. Share prices of most Silicon Valley suppliers took a beating on the news, with Qualcomm falling 1.7% to close at $54.77 as on Apr 16.Qualcomm’s improved and upgraded technologies are allowing companies to build new and updated products and services across the wireless ecosystem, thus better serving customers. For Qualcomm, association with China’s leading smartphone manufacturers means additional royalties. The company had earlier signed multiple licensing deals with various Chinese smartphone makers including Xiaomi. With these deals, it intends to extend its commitment to constantly aid the growth of Chinese companies and develop wireless networks, devices and applications.Citing a breach of agreement inked last year, the U.S. Department of Commerce slapped a seven-year ban on sale of various components to ZTE after it was caught illegally shipping goods to Iran. The strategic move is likely to hit Qualcomm the most, as it accounts for the lion’s share of semiconductor chips used in ZTE smartphones.ZTE reportedly shipped about 46.4 million smartphones last year. Going by a conservative estimate, if Qualcomm accounted for even half of them, it would mean a loss of business of approximately $0.5 billion, assuming an average cost of $25 for every chip used.In addition, Qualcomm could end up ceding its market position to its rivals as ZTE is the fourth largest smartphone vendor in the United States after Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report), Samsung Electronics and LG Electronics, with 11.2% market share, according to data from research firm, Canalys.Moreover, given the trade war between the United States and China, there seems to be no respite for Qualcomm. The Trump administration also perceives heightened threat of losing its technological prowess to the Chinese counterparts having earlier blocked a hostile bid by Singapore-based Broadcom Limited (AVGO  -  Free Report) for Qualcomm.This semiconductor chipmaker has underperformed the industry with an average loss of 19.5% in the last three months compared with a decline of 7.8% for the latter. It remains to be seen how Qualcomm responds to these challenges in the near future with some key insights expected in the first-quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Qualcomm carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A better-ranked stock in the industry is Comtech Telecommunications Corp. (CMTL  -  Free Report), sporting Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Comtech Telecommunications has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 5%.

2404,QCOM,"Ford (F  -  Free Report) took to the International Consumer Electronics Show stage in Las Vegas on Tuesday and has taken an early lead at this year’s showcase—in terms of tech that aims to reshape people’s lives—after it unveiled its plans for the “City of Tomorrow.”Over 3,900 companies are set to present innovations at CES this year, from start-ups to global tech powers. To name a few, Panasonic (PCRFY  -  Free Report), Nvidia (NVDA  -  Free Report) and Toyota (TM  -  Free Report) helped kick off CES 2018 with some major announcements on Monday.But today, Ford’s President and CEO Jim Hackett wowed the crowd as he and a few other Ford executives touted the historic automaker’s vision of a connected, self-driving future (also read: 3 Stocks to Buy That Have Already Shined at CES).‘City of Tomorrow’On Tuesday, Ford noted that it hopes to help drive the revolution towards connected cities, where vehicles, pedestrians, traffic lights, and much more will be in constant communication in order to foster a safer and smoother life.Ford noted that it believes “cellular vehicle-to-everything is the technology with the most potential to allow the cars and cities of the future to communicate quickly, safely and securely.” In order to start down this path towards the future, Ford announced a partnership with Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report).What’s more, Ford announced that it partnered with mayors throughout the country, as well as Bloomberg Philanthropies, to create new technologies that help make moving around cities much easier.But before the company can help create connected, futuristic cities that run more efficiently, Ford is dedicated to expanding its self-driving vehicle technology. Ford announced that it partnered with Argo AI in order to bolster its autonomous car tech. The company also joined forces with Domino’s Pizza (DPZ  -  Free Report), Lyft, and Postmates in order help “validate” Ford’s self-driving business model.Current Fundamentals Still, despite Ford’s forward-looking projects, many investors will want to know what the company offers them now.There are currently over 700,000 connected Ford vehicles on the road. By next year, the company plans to make every vehicle it sells in the U.S. a connected one. This is one of the most vital and first steps towards Ford’s vision of connected cities and roadways of the future.Ford also recently announced that the company sold almost 1.2 million vehicles in China in 2017. Although this figure is down slightly from 2016, the company is committed to increasing its sales in the world’s second-largest economy. “Looking forward, we recently announced Ford’s China 2025 plan to further accelerate our growth,” CEO of Ford China Jason Luo said in a statement.Domestically, Ford’s now iconic F-Series was the best selling best selling pickup truck in the U.S. for the 41st year in a year. Ford also posted record SUV sales in 2017.Currently, Ford is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and sports an overall “A” VGM score. Ford also presents outstanding value for investors at the moment, which is supported by its “A” grade for Value in our Style Scores system.Ford’s 0.35 P/S ratio marks a substantial discount compared to the “Automotive – Domestic” industry average of 1.13. The strong price to sales ratio helps demonstrate Ford’s ability to provide investors with a ton of bang for every investment dollar. On top of that, the automotive power’s 1.58 P/B ratio comes in well below its industry’s average of 3.33. Furthermore, Ford is currently trading at just 8.67x earnings, which is lower than the industry average as well as the S&P 500.Ford’s fourth-quarter earnings are projected to surge 46.67% to hit $0.44 per share, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates. The company’s Q4 revenues are expected to reach $37.15 billion, which would mark 3.19% year-over-year growth—which is not too bad for a company of its size and age. For the year, the Ford is projected to post sales of $143.96 billion.The automotive giant, with its eyes set on the future, is scheduled to post its fourth-quarter and full-year results on Jan. 24.Zacks’ Best Private Investment IdeasWhile we are happy to share many articles like this on the website, our best recommendations and most in-depth research are not available to the public.Starting today, and for the next month, you can follow all Zacks’ private buys and sells in real time.

2406,QCOM,"The Dow experienced a holiday-shortened but eventful week, notching up gains on two successive days. Markets were closed on Monday for the Christmas Day holiday. A decline in the shares of a key tech component pushed the Dow downward on Tuesday. Tech stocks snapped a five-day losing streak on Wednesday to boost the index upward. These gains continued into Thursday with the index closing at yet another record high.Last Week’s PerformanceThe Dow declined by 0.1% last Friday as investors were reluctant to participate in intraday trading ahead of the Christmas holidays. This led to unusually low volumes for the day as a whole.

Meanwhile, personal savings rate for November declined to a decade low of 2.9%.The index gained 0.4% last week, posting its fifth straight week of gains. Senate Republicans finally passed the tax overhaul Bill. This development permanently slashes the corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%.Following tax cuts, major banks and telecom companies pledged to provide better pay to their employees, which in turn boosted investor sentiment. Moreover, U.S. GDP increased in the third quarter, posting its best growth pace in more than two years.The Dow This WeekMarkets were closed for the Christmas Day holiday on Monday. The index decreased by 0.03% or 7.9 points following a decline in shares of Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report).

The technology sector snapped a five straight session losing streak to end in the green, buoyed by gains in Facebook, Inc. (FB  -  Free Report) and Microsoft Corporation (MSFT  -  Free Report). But, the broader market largely continued its winning run after the Republicans passed the first U.S. tax reforms in 30 years.Overall, investors found few catalysts in one of the lowest-volume weeks of the year.

2410,QCOM,"Last week saw Micron (MU  -  Free Report) suing United Microelectronics , Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) agreeing to transfer back taxes in Ireland, Alphabet’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) YouTube rumored to launch a new music streaming service and Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report) making important announcements at its annual Snapdragon event.Here are the details-Micron Sues UMCProblems between Micron and UMC have been brewing for some time and have mainly to do with the theft of Micron intellectual property by former employees who then share it with UMC and through it, with Chinese partners. This is not an isolated case and not the first time that this happened.This time, Micron’s former employees J.T. Ho, a process-integration engineering lead and Kenny Wang, a process-integration and device-section manager, copied DRAM process secrets in memory sticks and turned the information over to UMC when they joined the company. They then started recruiting other former Micron employees with the intention of making chips based on the technology.Micron ties this up with UMC’s JV with Chinese chipmaker Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit Co., which is in the process of equipping a fab in Jinjiang that will employ a UMC-provided 32nm process to run first silicon in the third quarter of 2018. The proposed fab, which isn’t government-owned but government sponsored, will make 60K wafers per month (wpm).This is significant on a number of levels. The first significance is with respect to DRAM prices and therefore, profits. After Micron’s purchase of troubled chipmakers like Rexchip, Inotera and Japan’s Elpida Memory, the DRAM market is almost totally owned by Korean players Samsung and Hynix and America’s Micron.This has led to very stable and strong pricing for the three and allowed them to generate good profits. But if technology leaks to Chinese players, they can flood the market with cheaper DRAM and bring down prices. On the positive side, the process leak is on the trailing edge side, so the damage may be limited, especially if Micron can continue to innovate. On the negative side, it will be very hard to bring trade embargo against stolen property as a legal remedy (as is usually done) because China is itself one of the largest consumers of chips.It is also significant for Taiwan as the country’s entire economy is dependent on its foundries, so intellectual property protection is an important piece of the deal. The Taiwanese government generally frowns upon any deal making with Chinese companies because Taiwan is much farther along in technological progress. Such deals are only allowed for trailing edge technologies when there are cost advantages for Taiwanese chip companies. Transfer of intellectual property or key technologies to China would mean loss of business for Taiwan as the Chinese can take over the entire market with cheaper products.Micron is currently expected to survive because its R&D remains ahead of the pack.Apple Makes Tax Deal with EUApple has agreed to pay Ireland nearly $14 billion in back taxes although the amount will be deposited in an escrow account opened for the purpose until a resolution of the matter (both Apple and Ireland are appealing the decision). The problem arose because Apple opened two Irish subsidiaries that controlled its European operations (so all European business was taxable only in Ireland). It also had an arrangement with the Irish authorities to pay virtually no taxes in Ireland.The Irish government agreed to the deal in order to attract investment to the country. The EU disputes that Ireland has a right to do this at the scale that it did under EU law. It is also an anticompetitive practice given that other companies operating in Europe have to pay taxes and therefore make lower profits than Apple. Tim Cook has reportedly dismissed the issue as “total political crap.”YouTube Remix Set for March 2018 LaunchGoogle is preparing to launch yet another music streaming service. The company launched the audio-only Google Play Music in 2011, following that up with the paid service YouTube Music Key in 2014 that ultimately became YouTube Red in 2016. Red was a disappointment for music labels since it wasn’t devoted to music alone but instead focused on YouTube original video.So this time around, YouTube is having a hard time convincing music labels that it will deliver the goods. It has brought in former Warner Music executive Lyor Cohen to head its music operations and that’s what likely led to the decision to launch Remix, a Spotify-like on-demand streaming service that will also incorporate elements like video clips that are more like YouTube. The company has reportedly already reached out to artists to promote the new service, although it is yet to sign on Sony, Universal and Merlin (a consortium of independent labels). Warner is already on board, it seems.Qualcomm Snapdragon Tech Summit At the Snapdragon Tech Summit in Maui, Hawaii, Qualcomm announced its Snapdragon 845, a highly integrated piece of hardware, marrying the CPU, the baseband modem, a digital signal processor, and an image processor for photos and videos, as well as the required additional circuitry. It is therefore expected to improve speech recognition and photography, while making the most of artificial intelligence, and combining both hardware and software resources. The goal is of course to support the creation of devices from multiple OEMs so they can function the way the iPhone does and make up for the business lost at Apple.With the Apple relationship souring, Qualcomm is going all out to rope in other partners. At the event, Qualcomm announced hardware partners like Microsoft, HP and Asus, all of which will launch new laptops and hybrid 2-in-1 devices powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 835 processor with 20+ real-world, always-on hours of battery life and Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X16 Gigabit LTE modem which can provide 1Gbps speeds on compatible cellular networks.The laptops will have the power to run practically all Windows applications despite the longer battery life. They may, however, have some limitations for gaming purposes. But Qualcomm’s stated goal is to blur the difference between laptops and phones by making laptops more like phones. TickerPrice Change Last WeekPrice Change Last 6 MonthsAAPL-1.8%+16.4%FB+1.5%+20.6%GOOGL+2.1%+9.1%MSFT-0.3%+20.6%INTC-3.7%+21.3%CSCO+0.5%+20.4%AMZN-1.0%+20.5% CorporateApple, Google, Facebook at China Internet Event: Technology leaders were well represented at China’s annual state-run World Internet Conference held at Wuzhen, a historic canal town outside Shanghai. The Chinese government has so far stuck to its policy of censoring the Internet and keeping foreign services such as Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), Google search and Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report) at bay.It has also banned some media output, games and movies, while tightening rules so citizens are unable to circumvent the restrictions through private virtual private networks (VPNs). Apple, which manufactures its devices in the country, has a bit more leverage than the others, but it has always toed the line in China. So finding something to praise the government for was difficult, but all the company reps managed.Toshiba-WDC Could Settle: Unconfirmed news reports say that Toshiba and Western Digital have come to an understanding that more or less settles the problems between them. Accordingly, the agreement requires Toshiba to extend its current joint venture agreement (set to expire in 2021) with Western Digital to its Yokkaichi fab, which entails allowing investments from WDC and supplying it with NAND chips. In return, WDC will withdraw arbitration proceedings against Toshiba allowing it to sell the business to a Bain-led consortium that also includes WDC customer Apple and competitors Seagate and Hynix.Separately, Hong Kong-based activist investor Argyle Street Management Ltd, a hedge fund with $1.2 billion under management, has told Toshiba that with the latest cash infusion, it doesn’t need to sell the business to the Bain-led group any longer. Reuters reports that Argyle is in conversation with at least three other investment funds to block the sale. It is also inviting the more than 30 overseas investors that took part in the latest funding round to raise $5.3 billion.Amazon Enters Australia: Amazon has dipped its feet into the Australian retail market with the opening of a massive warehouse on the outskirts of Melbourne and corporate offices in Sydney, Melbourne, Perth, Brisbane and Canberra. The positioning of the warehouse will enable Amazon to offer quick delivery to nearly four-fifths of the population. However, at launch, its offerings are limited and prices not always the lowest.This isn’t a winning formula in a market where around 90% of the population is connected and accustomed to transacting online. Its delivery partner is also limited to state-owned Australia Post. The thing about Australia is that it is very sparsely populated in most places. So delivering to remote areas can be tricky and expensive. That’s what Amazon is likely figuring out at the moment.Yelp Out of Favor: Piper Jaffray analyst Sam Kemp has said that he’s losing confidence in Yelp, which depends on Google, Facebook and others for a third of its traffic. He also feels that shortening attention spans along with crisp and improving reviews especially for things like restaurants and spas on these rival sites could lead people to move away from the typically longer format reviews available on Yelp. He therefore downgraded the shares to Underweight, sending shares down.Legal/RegulatoryAustralia to Probe Facebook, Google: In the wake of the evolving media landscape wherein news is increasingly consumed through digital channels rather than in print form, the Australian government is attempting to bring the Broadcast and Content Reform package. With the promotion of media diversity and support for media jobs as key government imperatives, it has invited the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) to scrutinize major digital distribution platforms like Google and Facebook to determine if they are adversely impactingconsumers, content creators or advertisers. The ACCC’s first report is not expected until December 2018, with the final report taking another six months.Alibaba Lawsuit Over IPO: Holders of Alibaba’s American Depository Receipts are suing the companyover the deliberate concealment of a meeting on July 16, 2014, two months before its $25 billion initial public offering, in which China's powerful State Administration for Industry and Commerce threatened huge fines if Alibaba failed to suppress counterfeiting.Earlier in June 2016, Chief Judge Colleen McMahon of the Manhattan District Court dismissed the nationwide lawsuit, because Alibaba had mentioned it under regulatory risks in its IPO materials. But this prima facie ruling (that doesn’t go into the merits of the case) says that the matter should have been treated as “highly material” to investors. As such, the case has returned to and has sent it back to Judge Colleen McMahon.Products/TechnologyApple Pay Cash in iOS 11.2: If you’re using a device running on iOS 11.2, you can use it to make peer to peer payments, much the way you would use Venmo or Square Cash. It’s a convenient way to make payments between devices running the latest of Apple’s operating systems, so it could be something of a headache for the platform agnostic services.Particularly because unlike the Apple service, the apps have to be separately downloaded. At the same time, their neutrality will likely help them grow despite the share loss to Apple. The company is also offering Apple Pay Cash to its WatchOS 4.2 users, so they can ask Siri to do the honors.  Apple Supplier Quanta Making AR Displays: Apple supplier Quanta (for its Watches and Macs)  has a new licensing deal with Israeli company Lumus, that makes the core display components for augmented reality (AR) glasses. Lumus technology embeds multiple prisms into a single sheet of glass such that the size and breadth of images increase even as the thickness of the glass sheet does not. Other complexities such as those related to low-light conditions also have to be handled.Because of the complexities involved, Apple’s Tim Cook has earlier said that we are years away from high quality AR, but since Quanta is an Apple supplier, speculations can’t be contained. It’s expected that the deal will enable the company to offer significantly higher volumes of AR glasses at a cost of $1,000 or less by 2019. C.C. Leung, Quanta’s vice chairman, said recently that it was part of an AR glass project and that he had “studied the optical technologies that AR devices have needed since two years ago”.Firefox Moves Back to Google Search: With the launch of Firefox’s new Quantum browser, the company has moved back to Google search as the default. The company had earlier contracted with Yahoo to use its search service as the default and that agreement is in force until 2019. So Yahoo owner Oath (after its acquisition by Verizon) has sued the company for breach of contract.Now Firefox has countersued, citing a clause in the agreement that allowed it to terminate the contract if Yahoo was considered unacceptable for some reason. The rub for Yahoo (and Oath) is that it is required to keep making annual payments of $375 million through 2019 in lieu of the contract even if Mozilla doesn’t use it as a default.YouTube Moved from Amazon Devices: ""We've been trying to reach agreement with Amazon to give consumers access to each other's products and services,"" a Google spokesperson said in a statement. ""But Amazon doesn't carry Google products like Chromecast and Google Home, doesn't make Prime Video available for Google Cast users, and last month stopped selling some of Nest's latest products. Given this lack of reciprocity, we are no longer supporting YouTube on Echo Show and FireTV. We hope we can reach an agreement to resolve these issues soon.""Part of the problem is also related to the way Amazon is using hacked versions of Google apps rather than working with Google to build suitable apps for its devices. This not only cuts out features from its services, but also makes it difficult for Google to monetize its services. So beginning on Jan 1, 2018, Google will remove YouTube support for all Amazon devices.Amazon Prime Video on Apple TV: A day after Google pulled its services from Amazon devices, Apple announced that the Amazon Prime video app was now available for Apple TV. So Apple TV customers will now have access to Amazon’s original content and licensed TV shows, though it isn’t clear yet if this means that Apple TV devices will now be available on Amazon.Amazon requires rivals to offer Amazon Prime video in order to be sold on its online shopping platform. Apple, Google and Amazon all make competing hardware and are investing in original and licensed programming. But Amazon has made the most progress and Apple the least (at least as far as content is concerned).NVIDIA Titan V: NVIDIA has announced the world’s fastest graphics processing unit (GPU) to bring machine learning capabilities to the desktop. Driven by the Volta GPU architecture, it delivers 110 teraflops of performance, or 9X the comparative model from Nvidia's previous architecture, the Titan XP, which was announced in April. Over the years, NVIDIA has positioned the Titan brand to mean cutting edge, so it represents the best of its capabilities. Moreover, recent revamping of the Volta architecture has made it much more energy efficient, so Titan V can manage double the workload at the same power as Pascal.M&A/CollaborationsNintendo-NVIDIA Deal in China: Nintendo has, for the first time agreed to make popular titles such as The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess, New Super Mario Bros. Wii and Punch-Out!! available through NVIDIA Shield, which went on sale on Dec. 5 in mainland China. The deal, which is a deviation from its policy of offering its games only on its own devices, is limited to NVIDIA and China. The company has said officially that it remains in negotiations with Chinese authorities to launch its own device in the country.Other consoles like Microsoft’s Xbox and Sony’s PlayStation have also not done very well, because the Chinese government generally clamps down on extremely violent or sexually explicit content, which is what sells the best, which is a pity because China’s gaming market generated $24.6 billion in revenue last year, even more than the $24.1 billion gaming generated in the U.S.Alphabet Investment in Lyft: Lyft is getting a boost from its illustrious partner Alphabet, which is leading an investment round to raise $1.5 billion (revised up from an earlier decision to raise a billion dollars). The funding valued the company at $11.5 billion, still well behind competitor Uber’s $68 billion. Other than Alphabet’s investment fund CapitalG, Fidelity Management & Research Company and Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan are participants along with returning investors AllianceBernstein, Baillie Gifford, KKR, Janus Henderson Investors and Rakuten. The company raised $600 million in May.Alibaba-Ford: Ford and Alibaba have signed a multi-faceted three-year deal that will see them collaborating more closely to sell Ford cars in China. They will also explore opportunities to work together on technology including cloud computing for big data analysis, digital marketing services through its Alimama subsidiary and using its AliOS operating system.Other subsidiaries will also play a role as required. It’s possible that Alibaba’s Next Retail strategy, which is basically an omnichannel approach, will also play a key role because car buying generally involves a research phase and a test drive phase, so both online (better for research) and offline (better for experiencing the car) aspects are important.Some NumbersApple Airpod Shipments: Renowned Apple analyst Ming Chi Kuo of KGI Securities has said that he expects Apple to ship 13-14 million units of its Bluetooth headphones (AirPods) in 2017. He also says that supply constraints prevented Apple from selling more this year, but that the number would double to 26-28 million units next year as Apple now has a new assembler in China called Luxshare. The expected launch of a new charging case that will allow users to charge them wirelessly, along with an iPhone and Apple Watch may also increase its popularity, according to the analyst.Apple Smartphone Share: Kantar Worldpanel ComTech has released estimates for iPhone sales for the three months ended Oct 2017 and the numbers understandably show some market share losses. This year, the iPhone 8 wasn’t a big jump from the iPhone 7 while the more expensive and radically changed iPhone X was just around the corner. So customers were most likely delaying their purchase until they had checked out the iPhone X. Android was the major gainer, especially in the U.S. and the U.K. Urban China was the most interesting where iOS grew and Android shrank regardless.

2413,QCOM,"The U.S. telecom did not witness much development last week. Nevertheless, a few are worth taking note of.Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report) plans to launch next-generation 5G wireless residential broadband services in three to five U.S. markets in 2018. The first commercial launch is scheduled in Sacramento, CA, in the second half of 2018. Verizon will be using millimeter-wave spectrum (radio signals) instead of copper or fiber cables, in order to provide customers with unmatched wireless speeds for Internet access.Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM  -  Free Report) recently filed three new patent infringement complaints against tech giant Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report). The leading wireless chipset manufacturer claimed that 16 of its patents were being used by Apple in its iPhones. The three cases were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California in San Diego. Notably, on Nov 29, 2017, Apple alleged that Qualcomm's Snapdragon mobile phone chips, which power various Android-based devices, infringe Apple's patents.T-Mobile US Inc. (TMUS  -  Free Report) has requested for Special Temporary Authority (STA) from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to test microwave radio spectrum bands in two sites in Bellevue, WA. The company has plans of evaluating microwave radio spectrum with integrated antenna for the 71-76 GHz and 81-86 GHz bands.Sprint Corp.

2416,QCOM,"Just when you thought earnings season was over… shares of both lululemon (LULU  -  Free Report) and Broadcom (AVGO  -  Free Report) are up in late trading today following their respective Q3-18 and Q4-17 earnings reports. Even beneath their headline beats, both companies raised guidance and supplied investors with plenty of goodies heading into holiday season.Broadcom, noteworthy lately for its move to buy out like-sized competitor Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report), outperformed analyst expectations on both top and bottom lines. Earnings of $4.59 per share outpaced the Zacks consensus of $4.52 on quarterly revenues of $4.85 billion, better than the $4.83 billion analysts were looking for. Guidance for fiscal Q1 2018 on the top line was raised to around $5.3 billion, well beyond the Q4 actual and the Q1 estimate of around $4.8 billion.A full $2.2 billion in revenues came from the company’s Wired business, with $1.8 billion coming from Wireless. Further, Broadcom has considerably upped its interim quarterly dividend by 72%. Shares are up more than a point and a half in after-hours trading, but have been trading down since Thanksgiving.lululemon, for its part, brought forth a 4-cent beat on its bottom line to 56 cents per share. Quarterly revenues easily surpassed the $610 million expected to $619 million in the quarter. This marks the third-straight positive earnings surprise, with a trailing 4-quarter average positive surprise of 8.5%. Comps rose 7% in the quarter, but with limited brick-and-mortar options (388 stores overall) it’s clear much of this growth for lululemon has come on-line. The company also raised Q4 guidance.

2417,QCOM,"Several large-cap tech stocks—including Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), and Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report)—were in the green on Wednesday morning, perhaps signaling that investors are ready to pile back on these firms after the recent sector-wide selloff.Technology companies have dominated Wall Street throughout 2017, but in a brief moment of risk aversion spurred by investors looking to sure up profits, tech stocks began to tumble from their highs last Wednesday. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slipped more than 2% over the next week, and 2017 darlings like Nvidia (NVDA  -  Free Report), PayPal (PYPL  -  Free Report), and Square (SQ  -  Free Report) were hammered.Before the dip, our “Computers and Technology” sector was up over 30% on the year, outpacing the S&P 500’s respectable 20% gain. This group is still well ahead of the broader market, but as we head into the New Year, investors simply seem to be less enthusiastic about tech.The selloff appears to be relatively short-lived, but renewed volatility in the sector serves as a reminder that tech stocks are not untouchable. This is far from the first major tech rally that the market has witnessed, and it is important for investors to remember how Wall Street reacted when the sector’s previous runs ended.However, investors should be skeptical of bearish voices that are quick to proclaim today’s tech market the second-coming of the infamous dot-com era bubble.The “dot-com bubble” refers to a historic period of over-valuation in the tech sector caused by the widespread adaption of the internet in the late-90s. Shares of internet-based companies skyrocketed, and investors were willing to pour cash into anything that ended in “dot-com.”By the turn of the century, however, overspending and a lack of real sales and profitability pulled the rug out from underneath the sector. Some of the period’s most-hyped companies, including Pets.com and Webvan, went completely out of business, while giants like Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report) and Cisco (CSCO  -  Free Report) watched their market capitalizations plummet.But herein lies the difference between the dot-com bubble and today’s tech growth. Earnings and revenue growth were never able to keep up with dot-com era valuations, while contemporary valuations are actually supported reasonably well by earnings and revenue.For reference, check out the average Forward P/E of our “Computers and Technology” sector during the dot-com bubble versus today: At the turn of the century, we were looking at tech P/E ratios in the 50s, nearly doubling the average of the broader S&P 500. Sure, today’s tech valuations are a bit loftier than the market as a whole, but the difference is miniscule by comparison.Prolonged tech rallies make investors uncomfortable because, to many, the dot-com bubble was not that long ago. However, the fundamental picture right now is significantly different. Smart investors cannot ignore these differences.Want more stock market analysis from this author?

2418,QCOM,"Keysight Technologies Inc. (KEYS  -  Free Report) is set to release fiscal fourth-quarter 2017 results on Dec 6. The company has delivered positive earnings surprise in the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 3.85%.The company’s focus on launching new solutions for growth markets like 5G, Internet of Things (IoT), next-generation wireless, high-speed datacenters and automotive & energy are expected to be key catalysts.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 1.67%. Non-GAAP earnings of 61 cents per share declined 2.6% from the year-ago quarter but surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 54 cents per share. Non-GAAP revenues of $863 million surged 21.4% on a year-over-year basis.For fourth-quarter fiscal 2017, Keysight forecasts non-GAAP revenues in the range of $875-$905 million. Non-GAAP earnings are expected to be in the range of 59-69 cents per share or 64 cents at the mid-point.Key FactorsDuring the last reported quarter, Keysight’s management stated that orders for 5G solutions have more than doubled on a year-over-year basis. The company’s expertise in high-frequency and millimeter wave technologies is helping it to partner innovators like Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report) in the domain.The trend continued in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 as Keysight and Qualcomm Technologies, Inc., a subsidiary of Qualcomm Incorporated (QCOM  -  Free Report) established a 5G data connection in a single-chip 5G modem.Additionally, the company also released the latest version of its SystemVue electronic system level (ESL) software aimed at providing designers with the first-of-its-kind 5G design and verification process.Moreover, IoT also presents significant growth opportunity based on the company’s broad and diverse portfolio that effectively addresses the needs of customers related to power consumption, RF performance, interoperability and conformance testing.During the soon-to-be-reported quarter, the company’s mobile IoTtest system was adopted by China Mobile Research Institute (CMRI) for the purpose of verification and optimization of IoT devices.However, uncertainties related to aerospace, defense & government (ADG) end markets are anticipated to hurt the top line of the company.Keysight Technologies Inc.

2419,QCOM,"Sprint Corp (S  -  Free Report) reportedly filed a patent infringement complaint against Mediacom Communications Corp. in the federal court in Delaware. Mediacom is a New York-based cable television and communications provider.Per sources, the national wireless carrier accused Mediacom's digital phone and business phone services of violating Sprint’s 13 patents related to voice-over-packet (VOP) technology. A VOP application allows both voice and signaling information to be transported over the packet network, instead of having a dedicated circuit for each call. However, it has to face challenges of combining legacy voice networks and packet networks.Per this lawsuit, Sprint is seeking damage recovery payment from Mediacom for each infringement. However, the exact amount has not yet been revealed. Moreover, Sprint is demanding an order to ban the sale of Mediacom's products.Notably, many companies like Mediacom have tried to benefit from Sprint’s VOP technology without prior consent. So, Sprint has resorted to legal measures to enforce the patent in the wireless industry.Several cases in the past related to VOP patents have been in the company's favor. In 2007, Sprint received $69.5 million from Vonage America Inc. on grounds of patent infringement. Between 2007 and 2009, Sprint filed complaints in the federal court in Kansas against four companies for infringing six VOP patents. The companies were NuVox Communications Inc., Broadvox Holdings LLC, Big River Telephone Co. and Paetec Communications Inc.In October 2017, Sprint and Comcast Corp (CMCSA  -  Free Report) settled a longstanding dispute over patents. The settlement amount remains undisclosed.In March 2017, Sprint received $139.8 million as damage recovery payment from Time Warner Cable for breaking norms for digital voice telephone services. In 2011, Sprint filed a lawsuit against Time Warner Cable and other cable television companies for breaking patents and using Sprint’s connections and services illegally, without permission. Charter Communications Inc’s (CHTR  -  Free Report) subsidiary, Time Warner Cable, was found guilty of intentionally violating the patents. The jury found that Time Warner Cable broke five patents for Voice-over-Internet Protocol.Notably, Sprint has reportedly received a total of $350 million from settlements related to several patent infringement lawsuits.Similar Patent Infringement CasesThe $1-billion lawsuit between Qualcomm Inc (QCOM  -  Free Report) and Apple Inc (AAPL  -  Free Report) is taking a bitter turn, day by day. With multiple counterattacks from each side, the case has currently taken the turn of patent infringement. Qualcomm recently filed three new patent infringement complaints against Apple in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California in San Diego. Qualcomm also claims that another 16 of its patents were being used by Apple in iPhones.This filing is a response to Apple’s latest counterattack against Qualcomm. On Nov 29, 2017, Apple alleged that Qualcomm's Snapdragon mobile phone chips, which power various Android-based devices, infringe Apple's patents.Zacks Rank & Price Performance Currently, Sprint is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.

2422,QCOM,"A successful investor understands the importance of retaining well-performing stocks in the portfolio at the right time. Indicators of a stock’s bullish run include a rise in share price and strong fundamentals. Though there may be some concerns regarding the stock but they are transitory in nature.Ambarella Inc. (AMBA  -  Free Report) is one such technology stock that has been on healthy growth trajectory, of late. It has rallied 52.8% year to date, outperforming 9.2% growth recorded by the industry it belongs to.Let’s now delve deeper and take a look at some of the aspects aiding the company’s performance.Upbeat Q3 ResultsAmbarella reported better-than-expected results for third-quarter fiscal 2018, keeping its earnings streak alive for the 10th time in a row. In fact, the company beat its projections at every point — revenues and margins.The company’s fiscal third-quarter revenues of $89.1 million surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $89 million and came toward the higher-end of management’s guidance range of $87.5-$90.5 million. Moreover, excluding sales to GoPro, revenues were up 7.2% to $70.6 million. Sales to GoPro significantly declined year over year from $34.6 million to $18.4 million.On per share basis, the company’s earnings came in at 75 cents, well ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 66 cents.Positive Earnings Surprise HistoryAmbarella has an impressive earnings surprise history. The company outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, recording a positive average earnings surprise of 12.8%.Further, it has a long-term expected EPS growth rate of 14.7%.Other Growth DriversAmbarella is well known for its market leading high performance video processing SoCs, which consume lowest power in this space. The company’s proprietary video and image processing SoCs are highly configurable, providing it a cost and power advantage against rivals, which use multiple expensive semiconductors in their video and image processing solutions. This makes Ambarella a suitable choice for wearable camera, IP camera, automotive dashboard cameras and drone camera makers.In a move to diversify business and lower dependency on GoPro, Ambarella has forayed into the VR camera space by launching H3 SoC in January this year. The company claims that the chip will work wonderfully for high-end drones and VR cameras. Although it will be very tough for Ambarella to compete against well established players such as NVIDIA (NVDA  -  Free Report) and Advanced Micro (AMD  -  Free Report), we believe that given its track record of innovation, the company has the potential to strengthen its position in the space.Risk RemainsNonetheless, the company’s disappointing guidance for the forthcoming quarter as well as downbeat revenue outlook for fiscal 2018 makes us increasingly cautious about its near-term prospect.Going forward, the company faces three main challenges, the risk of losing its largest customer, GoPro; weakness in the drone market and increasing threat from QUALCOMM (QCOM  -  Free Report), which is acquiring NXP Semiconductors to augment its presence in the same space.Other Key PicksCurrently, Ambarella carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold)You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Zacks’ Best Private Investment IdeasWhile we are happy to share many articles like this on the website, our best recommendations and most in-depth research are not available to the public.                                                                                                                                                 Starting today, for the next month, you can follow all Zacks' private buys and sells in real time.

2423,QCOM,"Shares of Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report) popped on Monday morning after Broadcom (AVGO  -  Free Report) made its massive buyout proposal public.The official Broadcom announcement came after news began to surface late last week that the chipmaker planned to make a bid for Qualcomm. Broadcom’s proposal values the struggling semiconductor power at $130 billion, including $25 billion of net debt, according to the official news release.The deal marks a 28% premium compared to Qualcomm’s closing price on Thursday—the last day of trading before news of the deal began to surface. In Broadcom’s proposed plan, Qualcomm stockholders would receive $70 per share, made up of $60 in cash and $10 per share in Broadcom stock.""This complementary transaction will position the combined company as a global communications leader with an impressive portfolio of technologies and products,” Broadcom CEO Hock Tan said in a statement.“We would not make this offer if we were not confident that our common global customers would embrace the proposed combination. With greater scale and broader product diversification, the combined company will be positioned to deliver more advanced semiconductor solutions for our global customers and drive enhanced stockholder value.""Broadcom projects that a combined company could effectively merge Qualcomm's cellular and wireless-based semiconductor business with its smartphone chip technology, data storage, and electronic displays business.California-based Broadcom expects a Qualcomm buyout would create “enhanced scale, reach and financial flexibility,” which would help the combined firm “accelerate innovation and deliver more advanced semiconductor solutions to its broad global customer base.”Qualcomm is still currently trying to negotiate a deal to buy fellow semiconductor company NXP (NXPI  -  Free Report). However, Broadcom made it clear that the company will try to complete its bid for Qualcomm whether the NXP deal goes through or not.Still, despite the hope for creating a more diversified business, regulators will likely play a large role in Broadcom’s proposed deal.Qualcomm is already dealing with its own regulatory concerns. South Korean and Taiwanese regulators have fined Qualcomm $853 million and $773 million, respectively, within the last year. Maybe more importantly, in terms of this new proposal, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission sued Qualcomm in January over antitrust concerns, although that case is still pending.On top of that, one of Qualcomm’s big-name customers, Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), sued the company for unfair patent-licensing practices and has since stopped paying royalties.Shares of Qualcomm gained over 2% on Monday morning to hit as high as $65.32 per share. Before news of the deal began to surface, Qualcomm’s stock price had fallen nearly 5% on the year.On the opposite side of the proposed deal, Broadcom’s stock price fell over 2% on Monday morning but remained near its new 52-week high, which it reached on Friday. The company’s shares have soared nearly 55% in 2017.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

2424,QCOM,"Qualcomm Inc (QCOM  -  Free Report) recently filed  three new patent infringement complaints against tech giant Apple Inc (AAPL  -  Free Report).The leading wireless chipset manufacturer claimed that another 16 of its patents were being used by Apple in its iPhones. The three cases were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California in San Diego.The filing is in response to Apple’s latest counterattack against Qualcomm. On Nov 29, 2017, Apple alleged that Qualcomm's Snapdragon mobile phone chips, which power various Android-based devices, infringe Apple's patents.The Story So FarQualcomm’s filing is the latest development in the legal war between the companies over patents. The companies have been battling over licensing royalty payments since January 2017. Apple slapped a $1-billion lawsuit on Qualcomm. Qualcomm was accused of overcharging for chips and refusing to pay around $1 billion in promised rebates. This suit was counter attacked by Qualcomm in April 2017, by clearly mentioning the value of invented technologies, their contribution and share in the industry through licensing program. The filing included details about Apple’s illegal and improper handling of agreements and negotiations with device manufacturers, misleading regulators to attack Qualcomm around the world and not utilizing the full performance of Qualcomm's modem chips in its iPhone7.In July 2017, Qualcomm filed a complaint with the United States International Trade Commission (ITC) against Apple for infringing six of its patents covering various aspects of mobile phone technology. Qualcomm had requested ITC to investigate the tech giant’s infringing imports and issue a Limited Exclusion Order (LEO) in order to ban importation of iPhones and other products linked with the patent in the United States.Before the dispute was solved,  Apple reverted with strong backups. The company garnered the support of Silicon Valley biggies and its suppliers in the legal spat with Qualcomm. Per media reports, the Computer and Communications Industry Association (CCIA) — which includes names like Alphabet, Amazon.com Inc., Facebook Inc., Microsoft Corp, Samsung Electronics, Netflix Inc, Intel Corp (INTC  -  Free Report) and many more — has filed a petition with the ITC to snub Qualcomm's demand of seeking an injunction on iPhone import. Meanwhile, Apple’s suppliers have filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, accusing Qualcomm of “violating” two sections of the Sherman Act, part of the U.S Antitrust Law. They have claimed that Qualcomm continues to extract additional licensing money over assembling of iPhones.With so many twists and turns, we await results on how this dispute pans out. Moreover, Qualcomm has been long grappling with legal disputes, regulatory proceedings and their related charges.Qualcomm’s Other LawsuitsIn October 2017, Qualcomm was fined around $23.4 billion Taiwan dollars (approximately U.S. $773 million) by the Taiwan Fair Trade Commission (TFTC) on grounds of anti-trust violations of its chip technology. Qualcomm is being accused for the prices charged for mobile phone chips and patents, which are in violation of Taiwanese competition law.

2425,QCOM,"Investors in Qualcomm Incorporated (QCOM  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Dec 1, 2017 $58.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Qualcomm shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Qualcomm is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Wireless Equipment industry that ranks in the Bottom 29% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30 days, seven analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while two have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 90 cents per share to 91 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Qualcomm right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options? Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

2426,QCOM,"Verizon Communications Inc (VZ  -  Free Report) plans to launch next-generation 5G wireless residential broadband services in three to five U.S. markets in 2018. Consequently, shares of Verizon gained 2.21% to $49.90 on Nov 29.The first commercial launch is scheduled in Sacramento, CA, in the second half of 2018. Following this, Verizon will be able to compete with Comcast Corp (CMCSA  -  Free Report), which provides broadband services in Sacramento. Additional details of this launch and the announcement of other markets will be unveiled later.During the first application of 5G wireless network, Verizon will be using millimeter-wave spectrum (radio signals) instead of copper or fiber cables, to provide customers with unmatched wireless speeds for Internet access.The company started conducting field trials for its upcoming 5G wireless network with partners. Verizon has successfully conducted customer trials in 11 U.S. cities. The company is focused on building a fiber and wireless infrastructure to deliver mobile video efficiently. The wireless giant, which was the first to deploy the 4G LTE (Long-Term Evolution) network nationwide, has initially tested equipment at 15GHz, 28GHz, 39GHz and 64GHz frequency bands for 5G network deployment. The company’s partners in the 5G project are Cisco Systems Inc., Ericsson LM Nokia Corp. and Samsung.Verizon anticipates catering approximately 30 million households nationwide with the initial 5G residential broadband services. Verizon claims that its 5G network will provide a download speed of 1 Gbps (gigabit per second) which is 200 times the throughput of the existing standard 4G LTE network. As 5G continues to evolve, customers will benefit from a wide array of services which include broadband, mobile and IoT (Internet of things).Impact on 2018 OutlookThe 5G commercial launch will not have a material impact on Verizon’s consolidated capital expenditures in 2018. The company expects full-year 2018 capital spending program to be consistent with the past several years.Verizon’s Latest Toil on 5GOn Oct 17, 2017, Verizon, Qualcomm Technologies, Inc., a subsidiary of Qualcomm Inc (QCOM  -  Free Report) and Novatel Wireless teamed up for 5G New Radio (NR) millimeter wave (mmWave) technology development and over-the-air field trials based on the 5G NR Release-15 specifications. The collaboration is aimed to enable the transition of  the mobile ecosystem toward faster validation and commercialization of 5G NR mmWave technologies. The venture will complete a full-scale commercial network deployment before the end of the decade.Rival’s Take on 5GVerizon’s closest rival, AT&T Inc (T  -  Free Report) has been conducting 5G network trials in Waco, TX; Kalamazoo, MI; and South Bend, IN, in sync with the company’s plan to offer standard-based mobile 5G services to consumers from late 2018. AT&T will allow participants access faster broadband services over a 5G internet connection and watch live TV via AT&T’s DirecTV Now. Colleges, hospitals, churches, restaurants and other small businesses are likely to be included as participants in AT&T’s new trial. In December 2016, the company initiated next-gen 5G technology trials in partnership with Ericsson using the millimeter wavelength technology in Austin, TX.Other national telecom operators including T-Mobile US and Sprint are gearing up to initiate full-phased 5G deployment from around 2020. Additionally, United States Cellular is also preparing to deploy 5G wireless networkWinding Up5G marks a revolution in the field of communications and technology. With the U.S. telecom industry continuously evolving, companies in the league are competing against each other to stay ahead. Verizon is leading the industry with the first commercial application of next-generation broadband services. Other targeted initial launches will provide a strong framework for accelerating 5G’s future deployment on the global standards.Zacks Rank and Price Performance Currently, Verizon carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.With such positives, Verizon portrays an impressive price performance. In the past month, shares of Verizon have gained 4.2% against the industry’s growth of 2.2%.  The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

2427,QCOM,"On Nov 28, we issued an updated research report on Broadcom Limited (AVGO  -  Free Report).Broadcom is benefiting from strong demand for its wireless solutions. Higher dollar content at the company’s large North American smartphone customer’s next-gen platform is a key catalyst.Moreover, completion of the long-delayed Brocade acquisition will boost the company’s position in the storage area networking (SAN) space.However, gross margin is expected to contract slightly due to unfavorable product mix (higher mix of low margin wireless business).Broadcom Limited Price and Consensus  Broadcom Limited Price and Consensus | Broadcom Limited Quote Broadcom shares have returned 56.9% year to date, outperforming the industry’s rally of 43.4%.Expanding Total Addressable Market (TAM)Broadcom’s expanding product portfolio makes it well-positioned to address the needs of rapidly growing technologies like Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G. Broadcom has strong ties with leading OEMs across multiple target markets that will help it to gain key insights into the requirements of customers.We believe that the company’s extensive product portfolio, which serves multiple applications within four primary end markets (Wired Infrastructure, Wireless Communications, Enterprise Storage, and Industrial & Other), will help it to gain significant market share in the long haul.Moreover, the company recently launched its first-ever silicon-proven 7nm intellectual property (IP) targeting application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) platform for deep learning and networking markets.Acquisitions Strengthen Broadcom’s PortfolioAcquisitions have played a significant role in deciding Broadcom’s growth trajectory. The addition of Brocade will help the company further penetrate the FC SAN market and garner competitive prowess in the long run.Broadcom is now targeting Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM  -  Free Report). The company had offered $70 per share, which was rejected by Qualcomm’s board as it undermined the company’s value.However, Broadcom remains committed to pursue the Qualcomm acquisition. Earlier this month, the company announced its intent to redomicile in the United States. Broadcom is currently incorporated in Singapore with headquarters there as well as in San Jose, CA.The redomiciling will help Broadcom to aggressively pursue the Qualcomm bid, which is rumored to be around $77 per share. Moreover, the company is planning to attempt a hostile takeover by placing its chosen members at Qualcomm’s board during the shareholder meeting set for Mar 6, 2018.Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to ConsiderBroadcom currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report) and NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) are other stocks worth considering in the broader technology sector. Both sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

2428,QCOM,"There were a couple of notable developments in the telecom space last week. Recently, Ajit Pai, the Commissioner of Federal Communications Commission (FCC), revealed a draft plan for a complete roll back of Net Neutrality. The FCC is set to vote on the proposed changes at its next monthly meeting on Dec 14.Notably, in May 2017, the FCC voted 2-1 to start the formal process of unwinding the Net Neutrality rules. There is little doubt that if the FCC repeals Net Neutrality laws, the ISP (Internet Service Provider) industry will be a major beneficiary.The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) filed a lawsuit against AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report) over its proposed $85.4 billion takeover of media giant Time Warner Inc. TWX). The agency has stated that the proposed deal will increase prices for rival pay-TV operators as well as subscribers. It will also act as a stumbling block for the development of online video. The telecom and pay-TV behemoth has decided to challenge the DOJ lawsuit in the court within the stipulated 60 day time period.Beside the above-mentioned developments, Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report) too remained in news last week. Verizon and AT&T inked a joint deal with Tillman Infrastructure to build cell towers in the United States. Privately held, Tillman is the owner and operator of towers, small cells and smart cities infrastructures. Per the deal, Tillman will construct customized towers and lease it to Verizon and AT&T. Construction work of the towers will begin in the first quarter of 2018. Installation of equipment in the already completed sites will begin at the earliest.Per recent news, Verizon and Comcast Corp. (CMCSA  -  Free Report) are planning to acquire some assets of Twenty-First Century Fox Inc. (FOXA  -  Free Report). These assets include movie and TV production studios, cable networks FX and National Geographic as well as international assets such as the Star network in India and the European pay-TV provider Sky Plc. These units have also been mentioned in recent talks between Twenty-First Century Fox and The Walt Disney Co. (DIS  -  Free Report).Per a recent Bloomberg report, Verizon is close to a new deal with the National Football League (NFL) for digital streaming rights. This deal will allow Verizon’s subscribers to easily access games on all devices — Internet-connected TVs, tablets and phones. The deal is a follow up of Verizon’s previous contract with NFL, which allowed streaming in devices with screens of 7 inches or less. Verizon currently carries A Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Moreover,  Verizon has come up with a range of wireline and wireless offers for Thanksgiving shoppers. The company is trying to attract fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) customers through a five-day promotion, starting from Thanksgiving Day on Nov 23 til Nov 27. Verizon is also offering attractive discounts on smartphone purchases. Under Verizon Unlimited, the telco is offering a $378 discount, which will be credited to the customer's account. The selected latest models under the offer include Google Pixel 2, Google Pixel 2 XL, Samsung Galaxy Note 8, Galaxy S8, Galaxy S8+ and Moto Z2 Force.Outside the United States, The EC (European Commission), the regulatory authority of the European Union, recently announced that its decision on the proposed merger between Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM  -  Free Report) and NXP Semiconductors NV (NXPI  -  Free Report) may come in 2018. Earlier, the EC had twice halted its review of the deal -- once in June and again in August. Initially, Qualcomm had anticipated that the buyout deal would be closed by the end of 2017. Notably, the proposed merger has already been approved by the U.S. antitrust authorities.Read the last Telecom Stock Roundup for Nov 16, 2017.Recap of the Week’s Most Important Stories  1.    In a historic decision, the FCC had approved Net Neutrality rules, on Feb 26, 2015, after a majority vote. The five-member regulatory body voted in favor of Net Neutrality with a 3-2 margin. However, the voting pattern was clearly divided along party lines, as three Democrat representatives voted in favor of Net Neutrality, while the Republican representatives opposed it.Ajit Pai, a staunch Net Neutrality opponent, has always maintained his view that consumers would be worse under Net Neutrality and should expect their bills to go up along with slow broadband speed.   (Read more: FCC Plans to Abandon Net Neutrality -- Major Boon for ISPs)2.    The DOJ in its lawsuit complained that the AT&T-Time Warner merger will be harmful to American consumers. The merged entity will enjoy control over both high-quality content and distribution medium, which is likely give room to AT&T to raise prices without investing much in offering innovative products. The DOJ has asked AT&T to either divest it DIRECTV division or Turner Broadcasting assets including CNN. However, the company denied the arguments.   (Read more: AT&T Faces DoJ Lawsuit for Time Warner Bid: What Next?)3.    Per recent news, Comcast was in talks with Twenty-First Century Fox to acquire the mass media company’s assets. Verizon also approached Twenty-First Century Fox about potential acquisitions. Walt Disney is also interested about these assets. However, according to domestic regulations, no company can own two broadcast networks at the same time. While Disney owns American Broadcasting Company television network, Comcast owns NBC Universal.   (Read more: Are Comcast and Verizon Eyeing 21st Century Fox's Assets?)4.    The partnership between Verizon and AT&T implies that the biggest U.S. wireless carriers are willing to strike deals with other vendors to secure prices for towers. Moreover, carriers are always looking for alternative partners to reduce their dependence on specific customer base, thanks to the already saturated domestic wireless market. Domestic telcos are moving away from traditional tower leasing model, in order to cut down spending as data consumption continues to rise.  (Read more: Verizon-AT&T Team Up with Tillman to Construct Cell Towers) 5.    On Oct 27, 2016, Qualcomm entered into a definitive agreement with the Netherlands-based mobile chipset giant for the latter’s acquisition. Per the deal, Qualcomm would be paying $110 per NXP Semiconductors share in cash, reflecting an enterprise value of approximately $47 billion (equity value of $39 billion) for NXP. In June 2017, the EC launched a thorough investigation into the proposed acquisition. The EC will conduct an in-depth probe to assess if the deal leads to higher prices, exclusion of rival chipset suppliers and reduced innovation in the semiconductor industry. The merged entity is likely to command a strong market position with an extensive portfolio of baseband chipsets and chips for near-field communications. (Read more: Qualcomm-NXP Semiconductors Merger May Get EC Nod in 2018)Price PerformanceThe following table shows the price movement of the major telecom stocks in both the last week and last six months.In the last five trading sessions, share price movement of the major telecom stocks witnessed a mixed trend. Barring Sprint, all three U.S. national telecom carriers, Verizon, T-Mobile US and AT&T gained value in the last week. However, leading pay-TV operators like Comcast, Charter Communications and DISH Network lost value in the same time frame. Meanwhile, price performances of most of the major telecom stocks were negative in the last six months. Sprint, DISH Network and Telefonica lost significantly in the same time period while America Movil gained the most.  What’s Next in the Telecom Space?We do not foresee any significant changes in the telecom industry or overall global economic factors that can affect the industry in the coming week. Consequently, we expect stocks to trade in line with the broader market movement.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone! It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

2429,QCOM,"Broadcom Limited (AVGO  -  Free Report) recently announced the first-ever silicon-proven 7nm intellectual property (IP) targeting application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) platform for deep learning and networking.The IP cores are built on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company’s (TSM  -  Free Report) 7nm process technology. The on-die computation required for training and inference of deep learning applications is expected to benefit from ultra-high density logic and memory of the 7nm ASIC platform.The combination of CoWoS packaging and HBM2/3 PHY caters to high bandwidth memory interface required for next generation training in deep learning, high performance computing (HPC) and routing applications.The platform’s SerDes cores (112G and 56G SerDes) are beneficial for switching and routing applications and inter-node connections in HPC applications and deep learning. The IP portfolio also supports SoC integration for 5G requirements.We believe this to aid Broadcom’s top-line growth going ahead.Growth FactorsBroadcom stock has gained 55.8% year to date, substantially outperforming the 40.5% rally of the industry it belongs to. The growth can be attributed to the company’s robust top-line growth and steady execution.Broadcom benefits from strong demand of its wireless solutions. Higher dollar content at the company’s large North American smartphone customer’s (Apple) next-gen platform (iPhone) is also a positive for the company. Robust industrial re-sales are also tailwinds.Notably, the company’s recent acquisition of Brocade Communications Systems is expected to boost Broadcom’s position in the storage area networking space.Broadcom is currently eyeing Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report). The latter has already turned down the recent takeover bid of $130-billion (includes $25 billion of net debt) on grounds of inadequacy as it is currently a leading player in the chipset market. However, the company is planning to raise the bid amount for Qualcomm, per Reuters.We believe that Broadcom’s product portfolio, enhanced by the offerings of its acquired entities, is a major tailwind. However, increasing competition from industry peers like Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) and Sumitomo remains a concern.Broadcom Limited Revenue (TTM) Broadcom Limited Revenue (TTM) | Broadcom Limited QuoteZacks RankBroadcom has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

2430,QCOM,"Trading volumes are low this week, as no major company is scheduled to report earnings. Also, no major economic data release is scheduled. Moreover, markets will remain closed for Thanksgiving on Thursday and will also close early on Friday. This is expected to further lower the trading volume.Per a Reuters article, trading volume amounted to 5.67 billion shares in U.S. exchanges on Nov 20, 2017 compared with 6.81 billion average volume over the last 20 trading sessions.Tech Sector: Best PerformerThe tech index has grown around 37% so far this year, led by rallies in major tech companies, compared with the broader market’s (SPDR S&P 500 ETF- (SPY  -  Free Report) return of 15.6%. For the sake of argument, Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) has increased 46.8% so far this year, while Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) and Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) have increased around 55.4% and 32.8%, respectively, this year.Internet and the smart phones have become an indispensible part of our lives. Be it home entertainment, getting essentials delivered at your doorstep or staying connected with the world on the go, consumers demand convenience. This explains the impressive performance as the tech sector aims at constant innovation.Tax Reform ImpactThere is increased uncertainty with regard to Trump’s ability to pass the promised legislations relating to tax reform. Although the House approved their version of the bill, there are significant differences in the bill from the Senate’s version. Markets are therefore worried that this could create hindrance in the timely passing of the legislation (read: House Passes Tax Bill: Likely ETF Winners & Losers).One significant difference between the two versions is the Senate’s plans to tax stock options when employees receive them and not when they exercise them. This might impact tech companies in a significant way if it passes to become law.Semiconductor IndustryThe semiconductor industry is exhibiting consolidating trends. Per latest reports, Marvell Technology Group Ltd. (MRVL  -  Free Report) announced that it would buy Cavium Inc  for about $6 billion, as it seeks to expand its wireless connectivity business.Share price of Cavium increased 10.8% at market close on Nov 20, 2017, while that of Marvell increased 6.4% at market close. The semiconductor index increased 1.2%.In the current scenario, we believe it is prudent to discuss the following ETFs that focus on providing exposure to the tech sector (see all Technology ETFs here).Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK  -  Free Report)XLK is a relatively cheaper bet on the technology sector.

2431,QCOM,"The technology sector is on fire given a deluge of upbeat earnings results and high hopes of the tax reform getting clearance. In particular, five technology stocks, touted as FAAMG – Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), and Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report) – led to skyrocketing prices.Additionally, a string of reports from other tech players like International Business Machines (IBM  -  Free Report), and Intel INTC added to the strength (read: Play IBM's Turnaround Story With These ETFs).Total earnings from 85% of the sector’s total market capitalization reported so far are up 22.4% on 9.3% higher revenues with 81.8% of the companies beating on earnings and 86.4% exceeding top-line estimates. While the beat ratios are in line with the last reported quarter, the growth rates are encouraging and higher than the recent quarters.Trump’s proposed tax reform policy, which could allow companies to bring back cash held overseas at lower rates, are fueling exceptional growth in the sector. Per Moody’s, the top five U.S. hoarders are from the technology sector, namely Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Cisco (CSCO  -  Free Report) and Oracle (ORCL, which hold 88% of their money overseas.Further, the buzz that communications’ chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO) is looking to make a bid of more than $100 billion for the smartphone chip supplier Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report).

Therefore, the buyout is believed to provide Marvell Technology an opportunity to expand its offerings and an access to newer market.Furthermore, Cavium’s strategy of breaking into Intel Corporation’s (INTC  -  Free Report) lucrative hold on the server microprocessor market makes it the most feasible buyout for Marvell Technology, per a Bloomberg report. According to the report, Intel holds over 99% market share in this space.In fact, Cavium got a major breakthrough in the server microprocessor market early this year when it announced that Microsoft Azure cloud platform will run on its ARM-based processors instead of Intel’s. Therefore, we believe that Cavium buyout will give Marvell Technology a direct access to this lucrative market.An Effort to Rebuild ItselfThe latest deal is believed to be Marvell Technology’s one of the biggest step toward rebuilding itself after the massive accounting scandal in late 2015 that plagued the company’s financial results throughout fiscal 2016. In fact, the company has overcome its prior headwinds and refurbished its senior management as well.However, the new management had been facing a sever challenge in the form of sluggish growth prospects in the hard disk drive market.Under the leadership of Matthew J. Murphy (CEO), Marvell Technology seems to restructure its business to focus on growth segments like adding offerings in areas such as data centers and wireless communications, which are anticipated to boost revenues.The Cavium buyout is projected to be in line with the company’s aforementioned initiatives. We expect the acquisition to help in lowering its dependency on hard disk drive market that is currently stagnant due to availability of other data storage solutions.Marvell Technology has marginally outperformed the industry in the last three months. While the stock rallied 29.9%, the industry to which it belongs gained 28.7%. Going forward, the deal depicts another move toward the consolidation of semiconductor industry. Earlier this month Broadcom Ltd. (AVGO  -  Free Report) made a takeover bid of $103 billion for Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM  -  Free Report), which the latter rejected saying its too undervalued.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

2433,QCOM,"The EC (European Commission), the regulatory authority of the European Union, recently announced that its decision on the proposed merger between Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM  -  Free Report) and NXP Semiconductors NV (NXPI  -  Free Report) may come in 2018.On Oct 27, 2016, Qualcomm had entered into a definitive agreement with the Netherlands-based mobile chipset giant for the latter’s acquisition. Per the deal, Qualcomm would be paying $110 per NXP share in cash, reflecting an enterprise value of approximately $47 billion (equity value of $39 billion) for NXP.In June 2017, the EC launched a thorough investigation into the proposed acquisition. The EC will conduct an in-depth probe to assess if the deal leads to higher prices, exclusion of rival chipset suppliers and reduced innovation in the semiconductor industry. The merged entity is likely to command a strong market position with an extensive portfolio of baseband chipsets and chips for near-field communications.Earlier, the EC had twice halted its review of the deal -- once in June and again in August. Initially, Qualcomm had anticipated that the buyout deal would be closed by the end of 2017. Notably, the proposed merger has already been approved by the U.S. antitrust authorities.On Oct 5, 2017, the U.S. mobile chipset giant had submitted its new proposal to the EC. According to Reuters, “Qualcomm has told regulators it will not acquire NXP's standard essential patents, which the Dutch company can sell to another buyer, the sources said. The company also agreed not to take legal action against third parties related to NXP's near field communication (NFC) patents except for defensive purposes. NXP co-invented NFC chips, which enable mobile phones to be used to pay for goods and store and exchange data.”Meanwhile, hedge fund Elliott Management Corp. and two other large shareholders of NXP have approached the company to renegotiate the terms of the deal, which they consider grossly undervalued. In August, Elliot Management had disclosed to having accumulated shares and derivatives amounting to a 6% stake in NXP Semiconductor. Majority of the company’s shareholders are now reluctant to tender their shares at the rate specified by Qualcomm.NXP Semiconductors is the largest manufacturer of high-performance, mixed-signal mobile chipsets with 14% market share. The company has a strong clientele serving more than 25,000 customers through its direct sales channel and a global network of distribution channel partners. The combined entity is expected to generate annual revenues of more than $30 billion. Also, it is likely to position itself as a strong player in the next-generation mobile chipset segment with a potential market size of $138 billion by 2020.Qualcomm expects the transaction to be significantly accretive to its non-GAAP EPS immediately upon completion. Further, the company expects to generate $500 million of annualized run-rate cost synergies within two years of the transaction’s closure.The takeover will also push Qualcomm up the ranks to the second position after Intel Corp. (INTC  -  Free Report) in terms of sales in the broader global semiconductor market. Moreover, the combined entity will emerge a formidable challenger to other large semiconductor firms like Broadcom Ltd. (AVGO  -  Free Report), which submitted a $135 billion (including debt) to acquire Qualcomm in Nov. 6, 2017.Price Performance of QualcommQualcomm’s shares have gained 25.2%, outperforming the industry’s growth of 8.5% over the past 30 days. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2434,QCOM,"Markets eked out gains on Monday to close slightly higher. While tax woes continued to worry investors, gains were capped further after shares of General Electric plummeted to a five year low after releasing weak EPS guidance for 2018. However, gains for Boeing and Mattel boosted the markets. Meanwhile, the investors closely followed Trump’s visit to Asia. Speaking in Manila Trump commented that he would make an important announcement regarding trade on Wednesday in Washington.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) increased a little less than 0.1%, to close at 23,439.70. The S&P 500 Index (INX) gained 0.1% to close at 2,584.84. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 6,757.60, gaining 0.1%. A total of 6.2 billion shares were traded on Monday, higher than the last 20-session average of 6.7 billion shares. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 1.27-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 1.02-to-1 ratio favored declining issues. The CBOE VIX increased 1.9% to close at 11.5.Tax Woes Keep Investors on TenterhooksLate last week, a version of the tax plan was released by the Senate Finance Committee. The Senate version differed from that of the House panel's in several ways. Unlike the House Republicans’ tax proposals which focus on reducing corporate tax rate from 35% to 20%, the Senate version supports a similar tax cut only by 2019. Also, per House Republicans, the top individual tax rate would be 39.6%, whereas the Senate version puts the ceiling rate at 38.5%. Worries over a possible delay in tax cut plans weighed on investor sentiment.The two versions of the tax Bill will be scrutinized and debated upon before reaching on a conclusion. Such a confused state of affairs dampened investor sentiment. Moreover, market watchers speculated that no formal decision was likely on the tax Bill before Thanksgiving, with some even speculating such a decision would only take place beyond Christmas. Such events dampened investor sentiment and capped gains for the markets.However, market analysts commented that major indexes are still trading at appreciably high levels. Such a run has been largely due to stupendous corporate earnings and a burgeoning U.S. economy.How Did the Benchmarks Perform?The Dow eked out meager gains, advancing 17.49 points to end in positive territory. Shares of Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) contributed to most of the gains for the Dow. The aero-giant’s shares gained 0.6% after it won a contract from Dubai airline Emirates for a provisional order of about 40 Boeing 787 Dreamliners. This deal is worth a sizeable $15.1 billion. BA possesses a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

For the next year, the electric giant expects EPS in the range of $1.00-$1.07, which is significantly lower than the 2017 guidance of $1.05-$1.10 a share. The company also reduced its dividend by 50% in a bid to focus more on health care, aviation and energy business segments. Such a decline in the shares of GE weighed both on the Dow and the S&P 500.The S&P 500 gained 0.1% to end in the green. Of the 11 major segments of the S&P 500, eight ended in positive territory. Shares of Mattel, Inc. (MAT  -  Free Report) surged 20.7% after Hasbro, Inc. (HAS  -  Free Report) approached the former for a potential takeover. Such gains for the toymaker boosted the S&P 500. However, gains for the benchmark was capped after shares of GE declined and weighed on the S&P 500.Meanwhile, Nasdaq also gained 0.1% to end in the green. The tech-heavy index was boosted by gains for the shares of Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report), which advanced 0.2%, 0.3% and 1.6%, respectively.Investors Have a Keen Eye on Trump’s Visit to AsiaMarket watchers closely followed Trump’s visit to Asia. On his 13-day visit to the continent, Trump has given hints regarding a ‘major statement’ on trade that he is expected to make on Wednesday in Washington. Speaking in Manila at the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit, Trump also mentioned that that he would announce details regarding the meetings he had with supreme leaders of China, South Korea and ‘lots of other places’, refusing to divulge any further details about the announcement.Stocks That Made HeadlinesCenovus Sells Weyburn Assets to Whitecap ResourcesCenovus Energy Inc. (CVE  -  Free Report) recently agreed to divest its carbon dioxide enhanced oil recovery operation, Weyburn oil facility in Saskatchewan to Whitecap Resources Inc, based in western Canada.

2435,QCOM,"We are halfway through the third-quarter 2017 earnings season, with 54% of the S&P 500 members having reported their results. However, the earnings calendar is not the same for all companies. Qualcomm Inc (QCOM  -  Free Report) will report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 numbers on Nov 1, after the market closes. Qorvo Inc (QRVO  -  Free Report) is set to release second-quarter fiscal 2018 on the same day.As per Zacks categorization, Qualcomm and Qorvo are grouped under the broader Computer and Technology sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors). Let’s take a look at the Technology sector, before we can discuss the financial and operating metrics of these companies.Technology Sector ScorecardWe have results from 54.4% of the Technology sector’s market cap in the S&P 500 index. Total earnings for these companies are up 22% from the same period last year on 8% higher revenues, with 79.3% beating EPS estimates and 86.2% surpassing revenue estimates.Considering the Q3 earnings and revenue expectations for the sector as a whole along with the reported results, Tech sector earnings are expected to be up 16% from the same period last year on 7.6% higher revenues.Moreover, this week await the quarterly results from tech giants like Apple Inc (AAPL  -  Free Report) and Facebook Inc (FB  -  Free Report). Apple will report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Nov 2, after the marker closes. Facebook is slated to release third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 1, after the bell.Tech Stocks Poised to Release Earnings on Nov 1Our quantitative model offers some insight into stocks that are about to report their earnings. Per the model, a stock needs to have the right combination of the two key ingredients, a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better, to deliver earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Qualcomm is one of the largest manufacturer of wireless chipset based on baseband technology in the United States. The company continues to retain its leadership in 5G, chipset market and mobile connectivity through its updated Snapdragon processors and applications.Per the Zacks Consesnsus Estimate, the company’s prospects in the to-be-reported quarter based on certain non-financial metrics look impressive., Total number of chipset-enabled devices to be sold in fourth-quarter 2017 is around 56 million. Qualcomm is estimated to ship approximately 216 million CDMA-based MSM (Mobile Station Modem) chipsets in the quarter under review as against 187 million reported in the previous quarter.Moreover, Qualcomm currently carries a favorable Zacks Rank #3 which increases the predictive power of ESP. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Despite such positives, the chances of this company beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the quarter under review is low. This is because Qualcomm has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% (the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 81 cents). (Read more: Can Qualcomm Pull Off a Surprise in Q4 Earnings?)Also, Qualcomm displays a mixed earnings surprise history. In the last four quarters, the company’s earnings were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two, while surpassing the same in the remaining two quarters, with an average beat of 6.49%. QUALCOMM Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise  QUALCOMM Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | QUALCOMM Incorporated Quote Qorvo is a provider of technologies and RF solutions for mobile, infrastructure and aerospace/defence applications.The company has a positive earnings surprise history, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimates in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 2.64%.For the second quarter of fiscal 2018, Qorvo forecasts strong sequential revenue growth primarily on the strength of mobile content gains on marquee platforms, modest improvements in the Chinese market and continued strength in Infrastructure and Defense (IDP) segment. Management expects non-GAAP revenues to be approximately $800-$820 million. Earnings are anticipated between $1.36 and $1.50 per share.We believe improving demand in China and IDP will act as key catalysts for Qorvo in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.Notably, China accounts for almost 30% of Qorvo’s Mobile Product revenues. Per market research firm GFK, smartphone demand in China increased 5% in third-quarter 2017, while average selling price increased 15% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Mobile Products is currently pegged at $616 million.Qorvo is benefiting from strong demand for its high-powered Bulk Acoustic Wave (BAW) for the 3.5 gigahertz band for 5G massive Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) antennas. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for IDP is currently pegged at $189 million as against $184 million as reported by the company in its previous quarter.Despite such positive outlook for the company’s growth prospects in terms of increasing revenues, the company’s unfavorable Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and -0.35% Earnings ESP dims the possibility of an earnings beat in the to-be-reported quarter. (Read more: Qorvo's Q2 Earnings to Benefit From Robust IDP Growth)Meanwhile, we also caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions. Qorvo, Inc.

Therefore, don’t forget to check our full write up on earnings releases of these stocks later.An Overview of Q3 Earnings We now have results from 272 S&P 500 members, accounting for 64.2% of the index’s total market capitalization (based on our latest Earnings Preview). Total earnings for these companies are up 8.7% from the same period last year on 6.7% higher revenues, with 75.7% beating EPS estimates and 66.2% beating revenue estimates.With 228 companies yet to release their quarterly numbers, total third-quarter earnings are expected to be inch up 5.4% from the year-ago period on 5.5% higher revenues.Around 900 companies are scheduled to release results this week, including 134 S&P 500 members. By the end of this week, we will have quarterly results from more than 80% of the S&P 500 members. Unlike the large-cap stocks in the S&P 500 index, we are at an early stage in the small-cap reporting cycle. As of Oct 27, we have seen results from almost 31% of the small-cap S&P 600 members, with the reporting tally crossing the halfway mark by the end of this week.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

2436,QCOM,"Motorola Solutions (MSI  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 2, after the market closes.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings (excluding 34 cents from non-recurring items) of $1.12 per share comfortably surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.04. Also, the bottom line improved 8.7% from the year-ago figure owing to an increase in sales, driven by the strong performance of its land and mobile radio operations.In fact, Motorola has an impressive track record with respect to earnings per share. It has outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last four quarters, with an average beat of 14.5%.However, the stock has struggled of late. This is evident from the fact that shares of the company have gained a mere 0.6% over the last three months, significantly underperforming the S&P 500’s 4.4% rally.The pessimism surrounding the stock ahead of its third-quarter earnings release is evident from a 0.7% decline in the Zacks Consensus Estimate over the last 60 days.Lets delve deep to find out the factors likely to have a bearing on Motorola’s third-quarter results.We expect Motorola’s results to be hurt by increased costs. However, the company is looking to drive growth through acquisitions. Though positive on the strategy, we note that costs associated with the acquisitions might weigh on the bottom line.In August 2017, Motorola completed the acquisition of the privately held Kodiak Networks in a bid to broaden its software product portfolio. Costs associated with the integration process are likely to hurt the bottom line.Moreover, adverse foreign currency movements might hamper results in the quarter. The company’s high debt levels also remain a concern.On the brighter side, increased product sales are likely to boost results in the soon to-be-reported quarter. Strong performance in the Americas region is likely to lead to the improvement.  In fact, Motorola expects revenues for the third quarter of 2017 to improve in the band of 3% to 4%, on a year-over-year basis.Adjusted earnings per share are projected in the range of $1.36 to $1.41. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.40 per share.What Does Our Model Say?Our proven model does not show that Motorolawill beat earnings in this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen. However, that is not the case as highlighted below.Zacks Rank: Motorola carries a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Zacks ESP: Motorola has an Earnings ESP of -0.24%, which acts as a spoiler. The Zacks Rank combined with a negative Earnings ESP leaves the surprise prediction inconclusive. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Conversely, we caution against stocks with Zacks Ranks #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderInvestors interested in the broader Computer and Technology sector may consider the following companies, as they have the right combination of elements to post earnings beat this quarter:AMTEK, Inc. (AME  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.18% and carries a Zacks Rank of 3. The company will report third-quarter earnings numbers on Nov 2.Arrow Electronics (ARW  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.05% and holds a Zacks Rank #2.

2437,QCOM,"Will Qualcomm Reject Broadcom Offer?
"
2438,QCOM,"Qualcomm Inc’s (QCOM  -  Free Report) board of directors rejected the recent $130-billion (includes $25 billion of net debt) takeover offer by Broadcom Limited (AVGO  -  Free Report). Qualcomm turned down the offer on grounds of inadequacy as it is currently a leading player in the chipset market.  Notably, Qualcomm has a market cap of around $95.2 billion against which Broadcom’s paltry $105-billion offer is quite disappointing. Also, Qualcomm is uncertain about getting regulatory support for the proposed deal.The proposal was forwarded on Nov 6, 2017, wherein Broadcom offered to acquire Qualcomm’s outstanding shares for a consideration of $60 in cash and $10 in Broadcom stock.Qualcomm currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Chipset Sales Drive GrowthQualcomm’s updated Snapdragon processors and applications have helped the company retain leadership in the global wireless baseband chipset market. Qualcomm is teaming up with Verizon Communications Inc and Novatel Wireless for 5G NR mmWave technology trial. This marks Qualcomm’s leadership in 5G, chipset market and mobile connectivity.Moreover, the company’s foray into areas like automotive, networking and mobile computing are favorable for prospects within the semiconductor industry. Such strategic business moves can be attributed to the shipment of approximately 220 million chipsets (up 4.1% year over year). This was also above the midpoint of 215 million, which was the fourth-quarter chipset outlook issued previously by management.The company is also confident about its ability to create significant additional value for stockholders, on the back of continuous growth in segments and the transition to 5G network.Legal Disputes Weigh on QualcommQualcomm has been facing regulatory proceedings of late. The company continues to receive charges for unfair business practices and licensing royalty payments. In May 2017, Qualcomm settled a licensing dispute with BlackBerry Limited by paying $940 million. In December 2016, South Korea's regulatory authority for economic competition, Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC), imposed an administrative fine of approximately 1.03 trillion South Korean Won (approximately $865 million) on Qualcomm due to unfair business practices. Meanwhile, the ongoing $1-billion lawsuit dispute with tech giant Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) continues to get bitter with time, which is affecting the company’s margins.Accordingly, Qualcomm’s fourth-quarter 2017 GAAP earnings plummeted 90%. The company's fourth-quarter revenues dipped 5%. Qualcomm’s full-year revenues fell 5% to $22.3 billion. Additionally, full-year earnings per share on a GAAP basis declined 57% to $1.65. Notably, its ongoing dispute and the related actions undertaken by Apple and its contract manufacturers have affected the company’s third and fourth quarters as well as fiscal 2017 GAAP and Non-GAAP results. Moreover, the previously disclosed dispute with another licensee, who failed to pay royalties due in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, has affected the company’s margins. Qualcomm expects these licensees to continue to take such actions in the future until the disputes are resolved.Bottom LineBroadcom’s successful takeover of Qualcomm might have been the biggest tech deal. The combination of Broadcom and Qualcomm would have created the world's third-largest semiconductor company, lagging Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report) and Samsung.We believe Broadcom might have to raise the value of the buyout offer to impress Qualcomm’s shareholders. We currently await updates on this front if Broadcom raises its offer or engages in a proxy battle with Qualcomm.Price Performance Qualcomm portrays an impressive price performance. In the past three months, shares of the company have returned 23.4% compared with the industry’s gain of 4.5%.  Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - Q1 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over.

2439,QCOM,"Early news to start the week ahead of today’s opening bell begins with a dividend cut to one of the U.S.'s biggest companies: General Electric (GE  -  Free Report) has announced it is slashing its dividend in half, to 12 cents per share. This comes as a surprise to much of the market, although under new leadership — CEO John Flannery replaced Jeff Immelt on August 1st of this year — we see number-crunchers at the company Thomas Edison once helped found seeing too much capital going out the door when it ought to be put to use internally.An investor meeting at GE commences at this hour to discuss this move, which had actually put GE shares in the green by roughly 1.5% this morning before reversing trend and sending the stock down 1.6%. Year to date, GE shares are down almost 33%. Also, guidance for full-year 2018 have been ratcheted down, from $1.16 per share previously to a range of $1.00-1.07 today.Singles Day OutperformsOver the weekend, while Americans celebrated Veterans Day (mostly by watching football and drinking beer), China procured the “single” largest shopping day in history: Alibaba (BABA  -  Free Report) alone brought in $25.3 billion on Saturday, with other Chinese online merchants such as JD.com (JD  -  Free Report) now joining in the fun. Compare this with Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) Prime Day, which most recently brought in a record amount of revenue for its 30-hour sale: $1 billion.What began as more or less a protest against commercial holidays like Valentine’s Day, “Singles Day,” which began in 2009, is now more broadly known the world over as the “Global Shopping Festival.” As this marketing bonanza continues to grow year after year, we also see some truly remarkable figures, such as 90% — NINETY PERCENT — of Singles Day purchases having been made via mobile. If this doesn’t inspire retailers to go strong into mobile sales from this point forward, they’re clearly just not paying attention.Markets Lower on Asia WeaknessIndexes in Asia overnight sold off, including in Japan and South Korea. We also see selling pressure on the British pound as Brexit processes make their way through the python. Calls for U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May to step down after just a year at 10 Downing Street — with the re-emergence of “fringier” characters on the British political scene like former Mayor of London Boris Johnson — now illustrate the possible reality of a “hard Brexit” analysts had been fearing since the surprise EU secession vote a year and a half ago.Japan’s sell-off continues from what looks essentially like a technical move, following multi-year highs in its market tapping out late last week. The Nikkei index fell by the largest amount since early April, without much to assign blame to but profit-taking and valuation correction. The Japanese yen is increasing in value against virtually al other major currencies, which may create market headwinds as Japanese products and services grow more expensive on the global market.Qualcomm Rejects BroadcomAs widely expected, Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report) has rejected rival chip-maker Broadcom’s (AVGO  -  Free Report) offer to buy the similarly-sized company for $70 per share. Qualcomm naturally considers the offer too low, and also cited present regulatory uncertainties as reasons for the thumbs-down to Broadcom. We await a follow-up move from Broadcom, but without any indication whether the company will make a more generous offer or simply let this go.

2440,QCOM,"The technology sector in the United States performed exceptionally well in the third quarter. A rally in tech shares saw the tech-laden Nasdaq breach its 50th record close of this year on the last trading day of the quarter. Further, increased investment in technological R&D has also bolstered the sector’s growth.Moreover, tech shares have posted stupendous earnings throughout this fiscal and we expect this momentum to continue in the near term. Lastly, Trump’s one-time tax repatriation policy is bound to make tech companies wealthier and hence we suggest investing now. This is why it would be prudent to invest in tech mutual funds at this point.Robust Technological Developments and Excellent EarningsAnother reason why the tech stocks have outperformed the industry could be the emergence of cutting-edge technology such as cloud computing, big data, Internet of Things, wearable devices, VR headsets, drones, virtual reality devices, and artificial intelligence. Strong earnings from tech stocks throughout 2017 have also been pivotal in boosting the sector higher.The Q3 earnings season is at full throttle and we believe the bullish trend in tech is likely to continue as tech behemoths, particularly FAAMG stocks — Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report), Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) and Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report) — are all set to report this week. We expect the FAAMG family to report robust earnings in Q3, while the broader tech sector is expected to be up 9.7% on 6.7% higher revenues. Acceptance of the Budget Blueprint Will Bolster Tech SharesIn a 51-49 vote late Thursday, the Senate approved the budget blueprint for fiscal 2018. Economists believe that such a move ensures taxpayers that existing tax codes could soon be rewritten. Meanwhile, market watchers continue to pour money into Internet and tech companies, and the most basic thing that is driving them at this point is taxes. Trump has promised to deliver historic relief to corporate America by lowering tax rates. The corporate tax is expected to be slashed from 35% to 20%.Another major reform proposed is the repatriation of trillions of dollars held as cash reserve overseas by the companies with global operations for one-time tax (reportedly 10%). Moreover, in 2004, the Bush administration attempted a similar repatriation tax holiday for bringing in overseas cash reserves for a one-time tax of 5.25%. A number of companies repatriated an amount exceeding $300 billion.Let us not forget that tech behemoths Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO  -  Free Report) and Oracle (ORCL  -  Free Report) hold 88% of their money overseas to avoid paying the 35% corporate tax rate on earnings. Thus, they are positioned to gain immensely under Trump’s tax reduction plan. Companies like Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co (HPE  -  Free Report) and QUALCOMM, Inc.’s (QCOM  -  Free Report) earnings are also projected to rise around 20.8% and 10.5%, respectively, on a repatriation tax cut, per Strategas Research Partners.

2441,QCOM,"We’ve got another busy week in store: more Q3 earnings and economic data, Republicans in U.S. Congress get busy working through the details of its massive tax reform program and the arrest in Saudi Arabia of a man known as “the Warren Buffett of the Middle East” are all grabbing headlines this morning. And we also see what appears to be a hostile bid by Broadcom (AVGO  -  Free Report) to take over Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report) for $70 per share, or $130 billion, including $60 billion in cash and Qualcomm debt.Should this merger deal be accepted, it would be the largest pure-tech deal in history, which would be accretive to Broadcom after the first year of the merge. But odds are very good Qualcomm will reject this proposal; though the company has acknowledged it has received the offer but given no indications that its board will find the terms favorable. Considering Qualcomm’s recent difficulties as a supplier of Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) products, some may see this as Broadcom moving at a very advantageous time.Reports this morning are that Qualcomm officials are openly questioning the initial asking price, as well as antitrust issues, in what is understood to be an initially negative reaction. And would Apple’s involvement — behind the scenes, perhaps — somehow manage to facilitate this deal down the road in a way that puts Qualcomm’s issues with Apple behind them? One thing is for sure: this is a discussion just warming up; we expect to hear much more about this proposed deal throughout the rest of this week and beyond.Prince al-Waleed bin Talal, reportedly facing money laundering charges following a corruption purge by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, may cause some ripples through the U.S. markets this morning — especially in two of al-Waleed’s major holdings, Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) and Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report). Questions regarding Middle Eastern countries surrounding and necessarily affected by the crown prince’s moves, such as rival major power in the region, Iran, and Lebanon, which has had its own issues with stability at the top recesses of government.Futures in U.S. markets are so far shaking all of this off. We are in the green again this morning, following 8 straight weeks of an up-market. As we’ve discussed before here and elsewhere, at least some of this positive sentiment is a result of hopefulness that corporate tax cuts will create new windfalls for companies and their shareholders, perhaps even before the year is out.Q3 Earnings UpdateCVS Pharmacy (CVS  -  Free Report) beat estimates by a penny to $1.50 per share this morning, on in-line quarterly sales of $46.18 billion. Earnings are down year over year, but revenues were up 3.5%. CVS also upped its earnings guidance for full-year 2017.Michael Kors (KORS  -  Free Report) well outperformed expectations before today’s opening bell, with earnings of $1.33 per share easily surpassing the 83 cents in the Zacks consensus, up 37% year over year. Fiscal Q2 2018 sales of $1.147 billion topped the $1.046 billion we had been expecting. Guidance for both fiscal Q3 and full-year 2018, on both top and bottom lines, were also raised.Mylan Pharma (MYL  -  Free Report), however, missed expectations on both earnings and revenues, with $1.10 per share short of the $1.22 we were looking for, and $3.0 billion in sales beneath the $3.08 billion in the Zacks consensus estimate. Weaker-than-expected performance in North America, underscored by a fall in EpiPen sales in the quarter, were cited in the company’s report.

2444,QCOM,"Another wave of mergers and acquisitions has lashed on the hot semiconductor space. This is especially true as communications’ chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO  -  Free Report) has make an unsolicited bid to acquire the smartphone chip supplier Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report) for $70 per share or $130 billion, including debt. The news was first flashed on Bloomberg last week.Under the terms of the bid, Broadcom would pay $60 per share in cash and $10 per share in Broadcom stock. This represents a 13% premium to Friday's closing price of $61.81.By acquiring Qualcomm, Broadcom could become the third-largest chipmaker, behind Intel Corp. (INTC  -  Free Report) and Samsung Electronics. This is because the combination would mix Qualcomm’s dominance of chips that connect handsets to wireless networks with Broadcom’s expertise in chips that link devices to Wi-Fi networks (read: Here's What Investors Need to Know About Soaring Semiconductor ETFs).The combination would represent the biggest technology acquisition in history, dwarfing Dell Inc.’s $67 billion buyout of EMC in 2015. In addition, Broadcom is also expected to acquire NXP Semiconductors (NXPI  -  Free Report), which Qualcomm agreed to buy in 2016 for $38 billion. The takeover is yet to be completed due to an ongoing antitrust investigation.The Broadcom-Qualcomm deal, if struck, would face heavy regulatory scrutiny given their sheer size, and heavy level of consolidation in the chip industry. The Bloomberg report came in a month when an ongoing legal battle with Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) over wireless chip pricing, patents and alleged anticompetitive behavior has led to weak trading in Qualcomm’s stock. Before the report, shares of QCOM were down 16% this year compared with a 41% surge in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (read: Take a Bite of Apple's Blowout Earnings With Top-Ranked ETFs).Market ImpactThe news has led to rise of 3.7% in Qualcomm shares in pre-market trade at the time of writing while Broadcom is up 1.1%. The Bloomberg report propelled Qualcomm shares up as much as 19% on Friday, the biggest one-day move since October 2008 and made it the best performing stock on the S&P 500 index on Friday. The stock crushed its average daily volume figure as it exchanged about 81 million shares in hand compared with 9.2 million shares on average. Meanwhile, Broadcom shares rose about 5.5% on the day on elevated volumes of 12 million compared with the 2.8 million average.Notably, QCOM has a market capitalization of $91 billion while AVGO has a market cap of $112 billion.Given the expected deal, investors seeking to ride out the surging corner of the broad tech space in a diversified way could consider the following ETFs.

Compared withcompetitive products like Alphabet’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) Google AI chip, analysts believe that NVIDIA’s processor has a larger potential customer base.“Incumbency matters and Nvidia has a much wider AI/machine learning ecosystem that will be tough to match,” Arya said.Notably, the company entered into a wide range of partnerships based on its AI technology, namelyBaidu, Foxconn, Inventec, Quanta, Wistron, Volkswagen, Volvo and Autoliv. Demand for NVIDIA’s DGX AI supercomputer also remained high as more organizations are keen on building AI-enabled applications. It has shipped the system to over 300 customers, so far, and more than 1,000 are in the pipeline. Per NVIDIA, Facebook is using its 128 DGX system. With these deal, NVIDIA will be better poise to reinforceits hold in the AI technologies.It is also worth mentioning that, NVIDIA recently unveiled a new AI supercomputer chip designed for self-driving cars called Pegasus at its GPU Technology Conference (GTC) in Europe. This new technology, Pegasus helps to drive fully autonomous robotaxis which can handle the concept of Level 5 self-driving vehicles and uses NVIDIA’s DRIVE PX 2 platform, trained on deep neural networks. The recent launch is seen as NVIDIA’s determined focus on remaining ahead of its rivals — Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report) and Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM  -  Free Report) — in the driverless car technology space.NVIDIA continues to be the world’s biggest graphic processing hardware provider for PCs since the past several decades. Recently, the company joined forces with Square Enix to unveil Final Fantasy XV Windows Edition for PC in Gamescom 2017. The collaboration is aimed at bringing an enhanced gaming experience to PCs. This deal is a positive for NVIDIA, as it will help the company gain market share among gaming content developers.We expect the momentum to continue in the to-be-reported quarter as well, consequently bolstering the top-line performance.Segments Continue to OutstandContinuing its earnings streak for the ninth straight quarter, NVIDIA had reported splendid second-quarter fiscal 2018 results, wherein it not only marked a strong year-over-year improvement, but also way came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Segment-wise, revenues from the GPU business jumped 59% year over year to $1.9 billion, driven by strength in GeForce GPUs Gaming revenues and datacenter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for GPUs is pegged at $1.962 billion, up 15.6% year over year.Revenues from Gaming GPU were up 52% on a year-over-year basis to $1.19 billion in the last reported quarter. Per the company, strong growth “reflects the vibrant gaming ecosystem, underpinned by continued excitement over our recent launch GPUs and other technologies, great games, and growing interest in e-sports.” The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Gaming is pegged at $1.332 billion.Additionally, revenues from datacenter came in at $416 million, registering a year-over-year increase of over 2.5 times, mainly fueled by strong adoption of artificial intelligence (AI), deep learning, high-performance computing (HPC), and GRID technologies. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for datacenter is pegged at $460 million.Tegra processor revenues came in at $333 million, which doubled on a year-over-year basis. The increase was primarily due to better-than-expected growth in Tegra development services. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Tegra processor is pegged at $375 million, up 55.6% year over year.Automotive revenues for the quarter came in at $142 million, reflecting an increase of 19% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Automotive is pegged at $150 million.Moving to Professional Visualization, revenues from Quadro increased 10% year over year and came in at $235 million. The increase was mainly owingto elevated demand in real-time rendering tools and mobile workstations. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Professional Visualization is pegged at $237 million.NVIDIA Corporation Price and EPS Surprise NVIDIA Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | NVIDIA Corporation QuoteWhat the Zacks Model Unveils?Zacks ESP: NVIDIAcurrently has an Earnings ESP of +1.60%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged higher at 96 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is at 94 cents. A favorable Earnings ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise.

2449,QCOM,"Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM  -  Free Report) reported strong financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 (ended Sep 24, 2017), wherein both the top and the bottom line outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Consequently, in  after-market trade on Nasdaq, the stock price of Qualcomm was up 1.01%. Net IncomeOn a GAAP basis, quarterly net income came in at $168 million or 11 cents per share compared with $1,599 million or $1.07 in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted earnings per share (excluding special items) were 92 cents, well ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 81 cents.QUALCOMM Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  QUALCOMM Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | QUALCOMM Incorporated QuoteRevenuesQuarterly total revenues of $5,905 million decreased 4.6% year over year. However, it surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,780.5 million.Segment-wise, Qualcomm Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) Technologies (QCT) contributed $4,650 million revenues compared with $4,124 million in the prior-year quarter. EBT (earnings before tax) margin was 21% compared with 17% in the prior-year quarter. Qualcomm Technology Licensing (QTL) generated $1,213 million, reflecting a sharp decline of 35.6% year over year. EBT margin was 68% compared with 84% in the prior-year quarter. The disappointing performance of QTL segment is primarily due to ongoing royalty dispute with Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) and another licensee.Chipset StatisticsDuring fiscal fourth-quarter 2017, Qualcomm shipped approximately 220 million CDMA-based MSM (Mobile Station Modem) chipsets, reflecting an increase of 4.1% year over year. This also came in above the midpoint of 215 million, which was the fourth-quarter chipset outlook given by management earlier.Operating MetricsQuarterly operating income came in at $333 million compared with $1,804 million in the year-ago quarter. Quarterly operating margin was a mere 5.6% compared with 29.2% in the prior-year quarter. Quarterly EBT was $434 million compared with $1,960 million in the year-ago quarter. EBT margin was 7% compared with 16% in the prior-year quarter.Cash FlowDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, Qualcomm generated $2,417 million of cash from operating activities compared with $2,084 million in the prior-year quarter. Free cash flow in the reported quarter was $2,155 million compared with $1,934 million in the prior-year quarter.LiquidityAt the end of fiscal 2017, Qualcomm had $37,308 million of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities compared with $18,648 million at the end of fiscal 2016. Total outstanding debt was $21,893 million at the end of the reported quarter compared with $10,903 million at the end of fiscal 2016. The debt-to-capitalization ratio at the end of fiscal 2017 was 0.39 compared with 0.24 at the end of fiscal 2016.Stockholders’ WealthDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, the company returned nearly $1.156 billion to stockholders. This included $841 million (57 cents per share) of cash dividend and another $315 million through repurchases of 6.1 million shares of common stock.First-Quarter Fiscal 2018 OutlookRevenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 are estimated in the range of $5.5 – $6.3 billion. GAAP earnings per share are estimated between 63 cents and 73 cents. Non-GAAP earnings per share are estimated between 85 cents and 95 cents. Qualcomm is expected to ship 220 – 240 million MSM chipsets in the ongoing quarter.Latest DevelopmentsQualcomm’s updated Snapdragon processors and applications look impressive and will aid the company in retaining leadership in the global wireless baseband chipset market. Qualcomm is teaming up with Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report) and Novatel Wireless for 5G NR mmWave technology trial. This marks Qualcomm’s leadership in 5G, chipset market and mobile connectivity. Qualcomm is extending cash tender offer for its pending NXP Semiconductors N.V. (NXPI  -  Free Report) deal. Meanwhile, the ongoing $1-billion lawsuit dispute with tech giant Apple is getting bitter, which is affecting the company’s margins.We believe such mixed prospects complement Qualcomm’s current Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2450,QCOM,"Monday, November 13, 2017Early news to start the week ahead of today’s opening bell begins with a dividend cut to one of the U.S.'s biggest companies: General Electric (GE  -  Free Report) has announced it is slashing its dividend in half, to 12 cents per share. This comes as a surprise to much of the market, although under new leadership — CEO John Flannery replaced Jeff Immelt on August 1st of this year — we see number-crunchers at the company Thomas Edison once helped found seeing too much capital going out the door when it ought to be put to use internally.An investor meeting at GE commences at this hour to discuss this move, which had actually put GE shares in the green by roughly 1.5% this morning before reversing trend and sending the stock down 1.6%. Year to date, GE shares are down almost 33%. Also, guidance for full-year 2018 have been ratcheted down, from $1.16 per share previously to a range of $1.00-1.07 today.Singles Day OutperformsOver the weekend, while Americans celebrated Veterans Day (mostly by watching football and drinking beer), China procured the “single” largest shopping day in history: Alibaba (BABA  -  Free Report) alone brought in $25.3 billion on Saturday, with other Chinese online merchants such as JD.com (JD  -  Free Report) now joining in the fun. Compare this with Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) Prime Day, which most recently brought in a record amount of revenue for its 30-hour sale: $1 billion.What began as more or less a protest against commercial holidays like Valentine’s Day, “Singles Day,” which began in 2009, is now more broadly known the world over as the “Global Shopping Festival.” As this marketing bonanza continues to grow year after year, we also see some truly remarkable figures, such as 90% — NINETY PERCENT — of Singles Day purchases having been made via mobile. If this doesn’t inspire retailers to go strong into mobile sales from this point forward, they’re clearly just not paying attention.Markets Lower on Asia WeaknessIndexes in Asia overnight sold off, including in Japan and South Korea. We also see selling pressure on the British pound as Brexit processes make their way through the python. Calls for U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May to step down after just a year at 10 Downing Street — with the re-emergence of “fringier” characters on the British political scene like former Mayor of London Boris Johnson — now illustrate the possible reality of a “hard Brexit” analysts had been fearing since the surprise EU secession vote a year and a half ago.Japan’s sell-off continues from what looks essentially like a technical move, following multi-year highs in its market tapping out late last week. The Nikkei index fell by the largest amount since early April, without much to assign blame to but profit-taking and valuation correction. The Japanese yen is increasing in value against virtually al other major currencies, which may create market headwinds as Japanese products and services grow more expensive on the global market.Qualcomm Rejects BroadcomAs widely expected, Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report) has rejected rival chip-maker Broadcom’s (AVGO  -  Free Report) offer to buy the similarly-sized company for $70 per share. Qualcomm naturally considers the offer too low, and also cited present regulatory uncertainties as reasons for the thumbs-down to Broadcom. We await a follow-up move from Broadcom, but without any indication whether the company will make a more generous offer or simply let this go.Mark VickerySenior EditorToday's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

2451,QCOM,"Yesterday, after the bell, NVIDIA Corp (NVDA  -  Free Report) announced solid results, topping the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 11.9% on the top line and 41.5% on the bottom line. Both numbers were up strong double-digits from the same quarter last year.The Gaming segment that contributes more than two-thirds of its total volume, grew 25%, as the company saw strength across regions and form factors. Management also called out strength in the Nintendo Switch console and cryptocurrencies as drivers. The Data Center segment, which accounts for most of the balance, saw the strongest growth of 109%, testimony to NVIDIA’s growing position at cloud service providers and prowess in high performance computing (HPC). The emerging Professional Visualization segment grew 15%, as VR adoption at defense and automotive customers increased and demand for high-end real-time rendering, simulation and more powerful mobile workstations and grew.Coming off the strong results, management raised the quarterly dividend and promised to return $1.25 billion in 2019 through dividends and share repurchases.Guidance was also encouraging with revenue expectations of $2.65 billion for the January quarter bettering the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.44 billion.Investors responded to the news by sending share prices up 3.2% in extended trading. But is the stock a buy at these levels? Let’s find out:The share price has increased 8.7% over the past month compared to the industry’s 13.6%. The S&P 500 has however has grown much slower, at 1.9%. Over the past year, the S&P 500 has gained steadily to trade close to its 52-week high, but NVIDIA shares have been far more volatile. Significantly, its median value of 94.3% is higher than the S&P 500’s 91.6% although both NVDA and the S&P 500 are currently trading considerably higher than their median levels.The industry has a much lower median value, although it is currently trading closer to its 52-week high. These comparisons seem to indicate that there is room for further upside in NVDA shares. P/EThe forward 12 months price-to-earnings ratio for NVDA is currently 53.3X compared to the S&P 500 average of 18.8X and the industry average of 20.0X. The high, low and median values are also higher. Moreover, the trend lines indicate that NVDA is clearly overvalued both with respect to the S&P 500 and the industry. P/SThe trailing 12 months price to sales ratio tells the same story. The P/S ratio for NVDA is currently 15.6X, which is higher than the S&P 500’s 3.15 but much lower than the X industry’s 6.25. The median of 3.34 is slightly ahead of the S&P 500’s 3.4 and the industry’s 5.0X. The highs and lows also indicate that NVDA is overvalued both with respect to the S&P 500 and the industry. P/CFIn terms of cash flow, NVDA’s valuation of 56.4X is much higher than the S&P 500’s 23.1X and the industry’s 25.0X. Moreover, the highs, lows and median values are also much higher. Look at Its Peers…While Advanced Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report) is NVIDIA’s closest competitor when it comes to GPUs, Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) is the one that it is increasingly pitted against as both companies look for growth in the data center, self-driving cars and other IoT. So let’s compare the two first.Intel’s current P/E based on forward 12 months earnings is just 14.2X, its price to sales ratio is 3.6X and its price to cash flow is 18.4X. So NVDA is obviously overvalued compared to Intel. A comparison with another semiconductor company Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report) shows that this chipmaker has a P/E based on forward 12 months earnings of 21.7X, a price to sales ratio of 6.7X and a price to cash flow of 21.6X. Here too, NVDA looks overvalued. ConclusionIt’s true that NVDA has a solid pipeline that should continue to generate strong growth for years to come. But given the strong competition from companies like Intel and ongoing consolidation in the space, it could soon see many other competitors in Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report), NXP Semiconductor (NXPI  -  Free Report), Broadcom (AVGO  -  Free Report), IBM (IBM  -  Free Report), etc.So the high valuation with respect to the S&P 500, the industry in which it operates and a couple of its semiconductor peers, is good reason for caution. Or at least, it’s good reason to go for Intel or Texas Instruments instead. Both these companies have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) -- you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here - that’s better than the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) assigned to NVIDIA.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

2452,QCOM,"Qorvo Inc. (QRVO  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter fiscal 2018 non-GAAP earnings of $1.52 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8 cents. The figure jumped 17.8% from the year-ago quarter.Revenues on a non-GAAP basis declined 5% year over year to $820.6 million. However, the figure was slightly better than the high-end of management’s guidance of $800-$820 million.The results reflected an improved demand environment in China. The company benefited from increasing dollar content across power amplifiers, switches, tuners and Wi-Fi in flagship smartphones from Huawei, Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo and others.Management stated that the unit growth is primarily driven by strong demand in India. Qorvo expects India to be an almost $1-billion opportunity for RF products by 2020.However, mix remains a drag in both regions as consumers are favoring mid-tier phones, which have lower dollar content. Qorvo, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Qorvo, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Qorvo, Inc. QuoteRevenue View UnimpressiveFor third-quarter fiscal 2018, Qorvo expects non-GAAP revenues between $830 million and $850 million. The mid-point of the range missed the consensus mark by almost $50 million.Qorvo cited delayed product cycle at its largest customer to be one of the multiple reasons that will hurt Mobile Products (MP) revenues in the current quarter. However, Infrastructure and Defense (IDP) revenues are projected to grow mid-single digits on a year-over-year basis.Moreover, fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 revenues are projected to decline sequentially.Qorvo fell almost 3% following the results. Notably, the company’s shares have returned 41.2% year to date, underperforming the 44.4% rally of the industry.Quarter DetailsSegment-wise, MP revenues were $630 million, which surged 38% sequentially, driven by robust performance in China.Qorvo’s BAW filters, antenna tuners, RF front end modules and envelope tracking power management solution were used in Huawei’s flagship Mate 10 device. Moreover, the company shipped more than $9 of RF content into Xiaomi’s Mi Mix 2 device.Infrastructure and Defense (IDP) revenues grew 21% year over year to $190 million. The growth reflects strong demand for the company’s solutions in defense (advanced radars and other electronic warfare products) and connectivity (Wi-Fi and emerging IoT applications).IoT revenues surged 50% from the year-ago quarter. During the quarter, Qorvo won a RF front-end module design, which supports the Tile tracker family. Moreover, dollar content per car from automotive IoT applications increased to $7 due to multiple design wins in the quarter.Moreover, Qorvo experienced strong demand for its 900 megahertz narrow band IoT infrastructure in China.Qorvo stated that its RF solutions are being selected at majority of the baseband platforms like Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report), Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM  -  Free Report), HiSilicon, MediaTek, Samsung, and LSI. This is proving to be a key catalyst for the company’s top-line growth.Operational DetailsNon-GAAP gross margin expanded 460 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter to 47.4%, lower than management’s guidance. This was primarily due to unfavorable mix and negative impact from an isolated air contamination issue in the company’s Florida fab.Non-GAAP research & development (R&D), as percentage of revenues, increased 70 bps from the year-ago quarter to 13.5%. Selling, general & administrative (SG&A) expenses, as percentage of revenues, remained flat at 6.7%.During the quarter, Qorvo reduced head count, which was primarily aimed at reducing cost and improving operating efficiency.As a result, non-GAAP operating margin expanded 530 bps to 28.1%.Balance Sheet & Cash FlowAs of Sep 30, cash and cash equivalents were $574.9 million compared with $512.6 million as of Jul 1. Long-term debt was $989.7 million as compared with $989.4 million at the end of the previous quarter.Net cash provided by operating activities was $220 million up from $104 million in the previous quarter. Capital expenditures declined sequentially to $68 million.Further, Qorvo has returned $57 million to shareholders under its ongoing $500 million repurchase program.GuidanceFor third-quarter fiscal 2018, gross margin is anticipated to be almost 47.5%, almost flat sequentially, primarily due to unfavorable product mix.Operating expenses are forecast to remain flat at approximately $158 million for the third quarter. Moreover, earnings are projected to be $1.60 per share at the mid-point of the company’s target range.Management’s guidance reflects strength at customers' flagship models and continued strength in IDP.Qorvo doesn’t expect 50% gross margin, while exiting fiscal 2018. However, the company anticipates gross margin expansion to restart in the fourth-quarter of fiscal 2018 and continue throughout the next fiscal driven by improving mix, ongoing productivity efforts and increasing fab utilization.Qorvo now expects revenues to decline less than seasonally over the December to March time-frame. In the second half, management expects double-digit year-over-year growth, with gains on new mobile platforms and continued strong IDP growth.Operating expenses in dollar terms are expected to decline from fiscal 2017 level. The company remains on track to achieve operating margin of 20% or lower in the long haul.Management expects capital expenditure to trend lower through the rest of the year, ending the full year below $300 million or less than 10% of sales.Zacks Rank & Key PickQorvo carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Advanced Micro Devices (AMD  -  Free Report) with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), is a stock worth considering in the broader sector.

2455,QCOM,"Other than some of the biggest earnings reports, last week was particularly eventful in terms of deals and product launched involving Cisco (CSCO  -  Free Report), Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report) and Facebook (FB  -  Free Report).Cisco Is Buying BroadSoftCisco is buying telecom software company BroadSoft for $1.9 billion. The company focuses on cloud-based private branch exchange (PBX), unified communications, team collaboration (called Team One) and contact center services, things that may be expected to improve Cisco’s collaboration business (which includes its own WebEx and Spark platforms), immediately adding to its revenue and profits.In the words of Rob Salvagno, Cisco’s VP of corporate business development, “Collaboration is the first step to business digitization and BroadSoft has partnerships with over 450 telecom carriers in 80 countries — including 25 of the top 30 globally — to 19+ million BroadSoft business subscribers. BroadSoft’s portfolio is complementary to our existing on premises and enterprise-centric Hosted Collaboration Solutions (HCS), as well as Cisco’s overall cloud investment strategy.”It’s no secret that this business hasn’t been too well, nor is it a secret that the market is getting increasingly crowded with Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Amazon, Slack and other startups fighting for share. Cisco needs to beef up its capabilities if it is to compete, particularly against a company like Microsoft, which offers end-to-end solutions. So this acquisition is definitely a step in the right direction.Amazon Launches Business PrimeAmazon Business just launched Prime shipping for its customers in the U.S. and Germany with the goal of delivering a broad selection, competitive prices and fast shipping, things that most business users need. Prospective customers can sign on for a 30-day free trial, after which they need to pay annual subscription charges of $499 for companies with up to 10 users, $1,299 for businesses with up to 100 users and $10,099 for those with over 100 users. Adding new users to existing business accounts automatically includes them in the group subscription.And that isn’t all: Amazon seeks to offer better insight and management of the entire procurement process with its purchase analytics, something that is likely to be just as important to business customers as the exclusive pricing and other Prime benefits that go with the program.It does look as if Grainger, Staples, Office Depot and the like are in for some increased competition, although it won’t be much of a surprise since Amazon Business has been around for a while (first launched in 2015 in the U.S. as a replacement for Amazon’s existing B2B brand, Amazon Supply, which launched in 2012). It currently also exists in the UK, India and Japan.Amazon Pharmacy License Sends Ripples Across MarketA report from St. Louis Post-Dispatch citing public reports said that Amazon obtained wholesale drug distribution licenses in 12 states (Alabama, Arizona, Connecticut, Idaho, Louisiana, Michigan, New Jersey, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Tennessee, Nevada and Oregon). As a result, drug wholesalers, pharmacy chains and pharmacy-benefit managers (PBMs) like Rite Aid, CVS, Express Scripts Holding Company, McKesson, AmerisourceBergen, Walgreens Boots Alliance and Cardinal Health shares dropped.But Stephen Buck of CNBC says that Amazon’s current license is for medical equipment, a market in which it is already a player. Moreover, in order to get into the drug distribution business, Amazon will need a ""Verified Accredited Wholesale Distributor"" (VAWD) license by the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy (NABP).And that’s something the leading online retailer doesn’t have today. But he agrees that it’s something that it can easily acquire in a few months for as little as a few hundred million. An Amazon statement said that the company didn’t comment on rumors and speculation.Google and Cisco Have a DealCisco needs virtualization tools to battle VMware’s software defined offerings and Google needs enterprise customers as it fights for share in an infrastructure-as-a-service market (IaaS) dominated by Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) has from the start been offering hybrid cloud tools (spanning both private and public cloud environments) for customers moving to the cloud but reluctant to move everything there (for regulatory, security or other reasons).Amazon, which on its own has only public cloud tools, recently tied with VMware to fill the gap in its product line. This makes Google and Cisco obvious partners.So Cisco will now be adding Google tools including Apigee, Istio microservices manger and Kubernetes container orchestrator to its HyperFlex hyperconvergence platform and have its considerable salesforce go to market with them. For Cisco, it might stem customer losses to the competition as it moves away from its core business of selling sophisticated high-end hardware. For Google, it’s immediate exposure to Cisco’s huge enterprise and government customer base.    As a result, “Developers will be able to create new applications in the cloud or on-premises consistently using the same tools, runtime and production environment.”The jointly marketed products will be available for some customers in the first half of 2018 before a broader rollout in the second. The revenue share details of the partnership haven’t been made public.Google also has a similar deal with Nutanix and since the agreement isn’t exclusive, Cisco could also have other partners. Facebook Auto MarketplaceFacebook Marketplace is partnering with auto dealers like Edmunds, Cars.com, Auction123, CDK Global and Socialdealer to facilitate the sale of used cars in the U.S. so you can buy used cars through not just individuals but also dealerships, thus greatly increasing available inventory. New search filters like year, make, model, mileage, transmission and vehicle type will also help you make a selection.Messenger and determine value based on Kelley’s Blue Book estimates. Chatting with the dealer’s employes through Messenger also enables wants a seamless experience.Facebook also offered details about its ecommerce activity that seem to indicate that it is as big as ecommerce sites like eBay or Craigslist, if not as successful. However, facts like global search volume on Marketplace growing 3X this year, 550 million people visiting formal ""buy and sell"" groups on Facebook each month, unique conversations between buyers and sellers in the first half of 2017 growing 70%+ over the prior year are encouraging. Marketplace is just a year old and it’s already available in more than 20 countries.Facebook infuses artificial intelligence into the platform to facilitate item discovery and it must be getting more popular with retailers given that the month of May saw 18 million unique listings on the platform.Other than auto, Marketplace also offers tickets through Ticketmaster and Eventbrite, daily deals through eBay, and retail products from the Shop sections of Pages. Home buying is next on the agenda. Other StoriesCorporateApple Makes Key UK TV Hire: Former Channel 4 content chief Jay Hunt will reportedly take up the role of Apple’s (AAPL  -  Free Report) creative head of European video operations in January. She will be working with recently hired Sony executives Zack Van Amburg and Jamie Erlicht. According to the Financial Times, which had an exclusive story on the news, ""When she starts at Apple in January, Ms Hunt will play a key role in its international creative development team as it looks to deploy a budget of more than $1 billion for original series over the next year.""The FT also reports that Hunt will have a free hand in selecting content, both drama and unscripted programming. This makes sense given her experience in content commissioning at Channel 4, Channel 5 and the BBC. After her resignation from Channel 4, Hunt was broadly expected to join a technology company and most people expected that company to be either Netflix or Amazon, both of which have made some considerable progress with their Originals program.Amazon Studio Head Departs: Following the departure of Amazon Studios chief Roy Price on allegations of sexual harassment, its head of comedy and drama, Joe Lewis is moving on and will be replaced by Sharon Tal Ygudo, who joined Amazon in January after a stint at Fox International. In her new role, Ygudo will be responsible for all scripted content as Amazon doubles down on the production of high-end drama series with global appeal. Amazon is on track to spend $4.5 billion on video content this year and has promised to increase that amount in 2018.Toshiba Chip Unit Sale Update: The Bain Capital-led consortium that includes WDC customer Apple as well as WDC competitors Seagate, Hynix and Toshiba feels that WDC is either misreading or misrepresenting its rights under the JV and that its three JV agreements expire in 2021, 2025 and 2029. It also threatens that WDC’s current approach was souring the relationship such that it may not have access to the NAND chips after the expiry of the three contracts.But that is anyway expected since the consortium includes two WDC competitors, which anyway indicates Toshiba’s attempt to push WDC out of the JV after benefiting from its technology. WDC is also heavily invested in the business having bought SanDisk for a hefty price tag and having followed that up with R&D and other costs. So as things stand now, WDC really doesn’t have a choice. It has to go to court.Legal/RegulatoryApple and Samsung Are Back in Court: Certain aspects of Apple’s iPhone design were copied by Samsung and the courts and jury have agreed that Samsung owes Apple damages. Initially, a jury said the amount should be $1.05 billion, and this amount was argued lower in subsequent confrontations to about $400 million. But another issue remains unresolved; i.e. should Samsung pay the damages on the value of the whole phone or the value of the components that it copied.The Supreme Court has ruled that a penalty based on the value of the whole phone isn’t justified. And now, Judge Lucy Koh of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California has agreed that a retrial makes sense. But they may just settle out of court to get the litigation out of the way before they take on Qualcomm together.EU Privacy Ruling Goes Against Facebook: Yves Bot, an advocate general of the EU Court of Justice, has said in a non-binding opinion in the capacity of advisor to the court that individual member states of the EU have power to take direct action against multinational operators like Facebook when they suspect illegal data processing has taken place. The thing is, these opinions are usually followed by the court, which could negatively impact Facebook, since it plants cookies in users’ hardware to track their browsing activity.A Facebook spokesman said, ""We respectfully disagree with the Advocate General and await the European Court's decision."" Note that a new EU data protection law is in the offing that will make the member state of a multinational company’s main establishment (in Facebook’s case, Ireland) the sole authority to decide such issues, so this looks like a temporary hurdle for the company.Tech Companies Lobbying In Washington: Google, Amazon, Facebook and Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report) spent $4.17 million, $3.41 million, $2.85 million and $2.2 million, respectively on lobbying in the third quarter. While Amazon spent on tax policy, cloud security and computing, and others, and Qualcomm spent on intellectual property and antitrust matters, Facebook and Google parent Alphabet were more concerned about protections granted by a 1996 law that treated them as platforms rather than content suppliers, thus limiting their responsibility for the things shared on their platforms.The Senate is concerned about sex trafficking and alleged Russian meddling in U.S. elections, so it is considering a law that makes the platforms responsible for the content shared. A lobbying group representing companies including Amazon, Google, Facebook has pointed to the “AI Principles” report presented by The Information Technology Industry Council.The ITI says that we are in the early stages of AI development and estimates that AI will add at least $7 trillion to the global economy by 2025. So governments and society should work together with technology companies rather than force them to disclose their algorithms, which can have undesirable consequences.Microsoft Wins One: Microsoft has dropped a lawsuit against the Justice department, which has been demanding information on its users while imposing gag orders so they can’t be informed. The lawsuit alleged that this violated the Fourth Amendment, which grants people and businesses the right to know if the government searches or seizes their property, and Microsoft’s own First Amendment right to free speech.In return, the Justice department will formulate new policy that will limit the use of secrecy orders and call for such orders to be issued for defined periods and ensure that the secrecy order requests are carefully and specifically tailored to the facts in the case.New Products/TechnologyFacebook Workplace Expands: Facebook has doubled its Workplace user base to 30K, and it includes illustrious companies like Walmart, Heineken, Spotify, Lyft and Starbucks. Facebook says that the platform is popular with companies of all sizes and is used in more than 70 languages. The company also announced a Workplace chat app for PC, Mac, Android or iOS that will support text-based messaging and group video chat.Workplace is free for nonprofits and the staff of educational organizations, but costs $3 per month per user for the first 1,000 users, $2 per month per user for the next 9,000 users and $1 per month per user after that for everyone else.Facebook Tries Splitting Its Newsfeed: Facebook is testing the effect of splitting its news feed: one focused on friends and family and the other dedicated to the pages that the user has liked. The idea is to force businesses that run pages to pay for inclusion in the friends/family feed. It’s just a test, but could have big implications since small businesses, artists, etc aren’t in the habit of paying for the service.On the other hand, some might have gathered a material number of followers that they’re dependent on, so they might be enticed to pay. But it may not be a good experience for users if they have to check two feeds for stuff that they’re interested in, at least if they don’t have a choice. Facebook is testing the thing in Sri Lanka, Bolivia, Slovakia, Serbia, Guatemala, and Cambodia and hasn’t said that there will be a broader rollout, but of course the prospects of higher revenue and more personal sharing by users is attractive. So if the tests show desired results, there will definitely be expansion to bigger markets like the U.S., Indonesia and India.Intel Optane for Gamers: Intel’s Optane SSD 900P Series are its latest PCIe NVMe 3.0 SSD family for hyper fast storage (read speed of 2.5GBps and sequential write speed of 2GBps) normally required for jobs like 3D rendering and 4K games, but also effective for increasing workstation speeds by up to 4X.Built on the 3D XPoint architecture Intel jointly developed with Micron, the storage devices offer very low latency (less than 10 microseconds) while significantly lowering wear and tear. The two products included in this announcement were a x4 Gen 3 PCIe version in 280GB and 480GB capacities at $389 and $699, respectively and a 2.5-inch U.2 drive in a 280GB capacity at $389.Amazon Key for Prime Members: Amazon has launched a new service for Prime members, if they’re willing to fork out $250 for an Amazon Key In-Home Kit that will include Amazon Cloud Cam and one of several compatible smart locks by lock manufacturers Yale and Kwikset. The installation can be done by the customer or free of cost by Amazon installation services. Thereafter, if the customer clicks on in-home delivery, Amazon will match the location with the driver and unlock the door for delivery while Amazon Cloud Cam records the process.The customer can see the delivery live or later on. It’s an interesting proposition, first because it eliminates chances of theft when goods are left on the porch or foyers and second because it literally opens the door for delivery of other services like maids and handymen. So people don’t have to stay home when receiving these goods or services. Amazon recently also inked deals with apartment houses that allow it to build lockers where customers might securely receive their goods rather than have them dumped in the foyers.Collaborations And M&ADelta Airlines Chooses Apple: Delta Airlines is standardizing its hardware and it has chosen Apple devices. So its 23,000 flight attendants will now put away their Nokia Lumia 1520 tablets in favor of iPad Pros even as its 14,000 pilots retire their Surface devices to do the same.For Delta, this aligns its devices with other airline partners like Aeromexico, Air France, KLM and Virgin Atlantic thus demonstrating Apple’s strategy of capturing enterprise customers. Both Microsoft and Delta have said that their relationship continues, which is true enough today since it still uses Microsoft productivity solutions.Apple Acquisition in New Zealand: Apple is buying PowerbyProxi, a New Zealand-based technology company as it goes all out to bring wireless charging to its product line. PowerbyProxi reportedly has 300+ patents and 55 employees and it’s one of the tiny tuck-in deals that we will never have too many details on. But Samsung was an early investor in the company through Samsung Ventures, which invested $4 million in it back in 2013. The acquisition may prompt Apple to make charging pads/mats/bowls/etc to charge multiple devices at one shot. LG Joins Amazon Prime Exclusive Phones Lineup: LG is bringing its phone lineup including the flagship LG G6 and LG G6+ devices, as well as the LG Q6 and LG X charge to Amazon Prime members at exclusive prices starting at $149.99. The unlocked phones have Android Nougat, powerful processors, high-end specs and other attractive features. Prime Exclusive Phones are offered at discounted pricing for Prime members and include personalized offers. But they also have ads, including personalized deals and product recommendations, displayed on the phone’s lock screen.Zacks’ Best Private Investment IdeasWhile we are happy to share many articles like this on the website, our best recommendations and most in-depth research are not available to the public.Starting today, for the next month, you can follow all Zacks' private buys and sells in real time.

2456,QCOM,"The Dow notched up minor gains over the week, before ultimately declining on concerns related to Trump’s tax proposals. Mergers and acquisitions related reports helped the index notch up fresh records even though movements continued to occur within a tight band. Ultimately, prospects of a delay in the implementation of tax cuts proposals dragged the index downward toward the end of the week.Last Week’s PerformanceThe index gained 0.1% last Friday on the back of strong earnings performance from Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) Better-than-expected earnings and favorable quarterly outlook from the tech giant led all the three key U.S. indexes to new record highs despite mixed jobs data. Additionally, the ISM services index hit its highest level in more than 12 years, which in turn boosted the broader markets.The index gained 0.5% over last week. Benchmarks closed in positive territory for the week after the Fed chose not to hike rates this month. Moreover, the Fed offered a positive view about the U.S. economy and said that it has been improving at a ‘solid rate.’Also, House Republicans finally revealed a detailed framework for the new tax policy, which also boosted sentiments. Additionally, upbeat earnings results also led the markets higher.The Dow This WeekThe index inched up by 0.04% on Monday following news of a possible merger between Broadcom Limited (AVGO  -  Free Report) and Qualcomm Incorporated (QCOM  -  Free Report). This is the 26th trading day when all-time high was achieved by all the three key U.S. indexes in 2017, marking the highest number of record highs achieved in a single year. Additionally, optimism over President Trump’s tax cut plans and upbeat third quarter earnings also boosted investor sentiment.The index once gained 0.04% on Tuesday to finish at a fresh record high. Weak profit forecasts from key stocks pulled the consumer discretionary sector downward, which in turn weighed on the broader markets. Also, decline in bond yields weighed on financials and concerns over the timing and implementation of Trump’s tax cut plans resulted in a small-cap stock selloff.Meanwhile, reports emerged that The Walt Disney Company (DIS  -  Free Report) was in talks recently with Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. (FOXA  -  Free Report) to acquire a large part of the latter’s entertainment business. Although, there is no certainty whether the deal will go through, shares of Walt Disney increased 1% following this development. Gains in Walt Disney boosted the blue-chip index to close on a new high.The index increased 0.03% on Wednesday, settling at yet another all-time high even as Apple’s market value jumped over the $900 billion mark for the first time ever. However, concerns remained over the timing and implementation of Trump’s tax cut plans after Republicans lost elections to the governorship of Virginia and New Jersey on Tuesday. These factors, along with declining bond yields weighed on bank stocks.The index declined by 0.4% on Thursday following concerns over a likely delay in the Trump administration’s tax cut plans. The Senate Finance Committee released a tax plan which aims to reduce corporate tax rate to 20% but not before 2019, in contrast to the 2018 deadline proposed by the House Republicans.Although, investors turned jittery following concerns that tax cut may be delayed, markets curtailed some of the day’s declines after the House Ways and Committee passed a bill to reframe the tax reforms.Components Moving the Index Disney reported negative earnings surprise in the fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 after beating the estimate in the trailing three quarters. Moreover, the company’s top-line also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fifth straight quarter.The company’s adjusted earnings in the reported quarter came in at $1.07 per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.12 and also decreased 3% year over year. Moreover, revenues came in at $12,779 million, down 3% year over year and also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13,149 million.The company’s disappointing results in the quarter was primarily caused by dismal performance of Media Networks, Studio Entertainment and Consumer Products & Interactive Media, which overshadowed growth at Parks and Resorts.Even though the company reported dismal results, shares inched up nearly 1% during the after-hour trading session on Nov 10 after the company announced that it has sealed a deal with Rian Johnson, the director of The Last Jedi, to produce a brand new Star Wars trilogy.Chevron Corporation (CVX  -  Free Report) recently announced that its Canadian unit is progressing with its shale play development in the East Kaybob region located in Duvernay formation of west-central Alberta. It will be the company's first shale play development in Canada.Of the 330,000 acres in the formation, Chevron Canada holds 70% operating stakes, where it plans to start development in about 55,000 acres of the liquid-rich Duvernay. It has been almost eight years since the company registered its presence in Duvernay and is now one the biggest landholders in the basin.Chevron used its experience of operating in the North American shale assets during appraisal drilling for the project. The company has yet to provide the financial details of the project, which is expected to come online during the second half of 2019.Canadian shale plays – like Duvernay and Montney – continue to remain attractive to players like Chevron as it is much cheaper to drill and complete oil wells in these formations compared to the costly oil sands. Apart from the assets in the Duvernay formation, Chevron has stakes in the Liard and Horn River basins located in Western Canada. The stock has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) announced that it has won a $37 billion order to provide 300 planes to China Aviation Supplies Holding Company. This deal is among the several agreements concluded during President Trump’s state visit to China.According to the state owned company, which is a lessor of airplanes to China’s airlines, the deal includes the supply of 40 B-777s and B-787s as well as 260 B-737s. Boeing has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).However, some analysts opined that this agreement could overlap with a similar 300 plane deal struck during the Chinese president’s visit to the United States in 2015. The deal concluded at that time encompassed the supply of 50 wide body aircraft and 190 B-737s as well as the lease of another 60 B-737s.General Electric Company (GE  -  Free Report) has inked three engine and aviation agreements worth $3.5 billion with Chinese partners during President Trump’s state visit to China, which is aimed at boosting trade between the United States and China. These agreements were finalized in the presence of Trump and Chinese president Xi Jinping.Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) GE signed a $1.4 billion deal for engines and repairs with Juneyao Airlines Co Ltd. The company also concluded an agreement to supply 80 Leap-1B engines to ICBC Leasing, which will be utilized in 40 Boeing 737 MAX Aircraft. Also, GE will also supply $1 billion worth turbines and related components to China Datang Group.American Express Company (AXP  -  Free Report) has launched the Amex Advance platform which facilitates the delivery of personalized services using cutting edge machine learning techniques. The new platform will assist marketers in selecting specific target customer segments as well in measuring the effectiveness of their efforts.Amex Advance enables secure analysis of closed loop Zacks Rank #3 American Express’ transaction data.

Investors have possibly priced in the impact of such tax relief measures and any unwelcome news will lead to losses in the short term. However, the current market rally is mostly a product of a resilient U.S. economy and strong earnings performances. It is likely that stocks will return to their winning ways after a brief interlude caused by such tax plan jitters.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!                   It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

2457,QCOM,"Juniper Networks Inc. (JNPR  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter 2017 non-GAAP earnings of 55 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny.However, earnings decreased 5.2% year over year primarily due to lower revenues, which fell 2.1% to $1.26 billion. The figure also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.28 billion.The disappointing top-line growth can be attributed to weak performance in both Cloud and Telecom/Cable verticals.Cloud revenues declined 4% from the year-ago quarter and more than 9% sequentially to almost $345 million. Management cited spending delay by cloud and hyper-scale customers behind the decline. This factor is again expected to hurt top-line growth in the current quarter.Juniper stated that the ongoing transition by cloud customers from 10-gigabit to 40-gigabit and 100-gigabit was the primary cause behind low revenues. Moreover, architectural shift from scale-up architectures to scale-out architectures (lean core architectures, per Juniper) also hurt growth.Nevertheless, Juniper’s cloud customer base continues to expand.

2458,QCOM,"After a lukewarm first half of 2017, most of the major telecommunications stocks have done well in the third quarter. The new U.S. telecom regulatory body, Federal Communications Commission (FCC), has given enough indications of its leniency compared with the Obama administration. The FCC is most likely to roll back a slew of stringent regulations of the previous regime. The FCC’s stance of being less restrictive will aid mergers and acquisitions, which are likely to spur growth in the rest of 2017.2 Major Future Drivers of Telecom IndustryUpcoming 5G Wireless Networks: According to a study commissioned by Qualcomm, fifth-generation (5G) wireless technology could result in real global economic growth by $3 trillion cumulatively from 2020 to 2035. A number of industry researchers are of the opinion that 5G network will provide a download speed of 1 Gbps (gigabit per second), which is 200 times the throughput of the currently available standard 4G LTE network.Internet of Things (IoT): Internet of Things, which enables any physical electronic device with a valid IP-address to transfer data seamlessly over a wireless network, is fast gaining market traction and bringing about fundamental changes in business models. Next-generation superfast wireless networks will provide the primary impetus to the telecom industry. In this context, IoT holds the potential of being the numero uno factor in driving growth in the space. Upcoming 5G mobile networks will be of utmost importance in the management of exponential growth in IoT.Additionally, a major characteristic of the telecommunications industry is that it is immune to international geo-political disturbances even when these lead to economic fluctuations. A growing economy speeds up the demand for real-time voice, data, and video manifold. The escalation in demand has encouraged telecom service providers to undertake large network extensions while upgrading plans. The rising demand for technologically superior products has been a silver lining for the telecom industry in an otherwise tough environment.Performance So FarPer the latest Zacks Earnings Trend report, 87 S&P 500 members (accounting for 24.7% of the index’s total membership) have reported third-quarter earnings results as of Oct 20. Total earnings for these companies are up 9.4% from the same period last year on 7.3% higher revenues, with 71.3% beating EPS estimates and 70.1% beating revenue estimates.The results thus far provide a positive and reassuring view of corporate earnings, which will most likely get strengthened and reconfirmed through the remainder of this reporting cycle. The above-average proportion of positive surprises that we saw in the preceding period has continued this earnings season as well. (Read: Three Takeaways from the Q3 Earnings Season)In the telecom sector, two major national telecom carriers, Verizon Communications and T-Mobile US, have reported strong results in third-quarter 2017. Both carriers have witnessed significant net addition of post-paid wireless subscribers with reduced churn rate.President Donald Trump’s proposed policy changes have made the overall economic outlook fairly bullish. Major proposals like a pledge to spend $1 trillion in infrastructure projects over a period of 10 years, overhaul of the tax structure to reduce tax burden and easy regulatory policies, are likely to spur higher consumer spending that may create about 25 million new jobs over a decade. This in turn will fuel long-term economic growth.How to Make a Selection?With the existence of a number of industry players, finding the right stocks that have the potential to beat earnings estimates could appear a difficult task, however, our proprietary methodology makes it fairly simple for you. One way to narrow down the list of choices during the earnings season is to look at stocks that have the combination of a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP.Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks that have high chances of surprising with their next earnings announcement. It shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Our research shows that for stocks with this combination, the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Our ChoicesRelying on the above methodology, we have zeroed in on seven telecom stocks that are likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this earnings season.Sonus Networks Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +16.28% and sports a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank  stocks here. The company is scheduled to report results on Oct 30. It has an average positive earnings surprise of a massive 55.46% in the last four quarters.Harris Corp. (HRS  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.50% and sports a Zacks Rank #1. The company is scheduled to report results on Oct 31. It has an average positive earnings surprise of 2.99% in the last four quarters and a long-term (three-five years) earnings growth rate of 7%.Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.38% and sports a Zacks Rank #2. The company is scheduled to report results on Nov 1. It has an average positive earnings surprise of 6.45% in the last four quarters and a long-term (three-five years) earnings growth rate of 9.37%.Ubiquiti Networks Inc. (UBNT  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +5.88% and sports a Zacks Rank #2. The company is scheduled to report results on Nov 2. It has an average positive earnings surprise of 4.99% in the last four quarters and a substantial long-term (three-five years) earnings growth rate of 20.09%.America Movil S.A.B de C.V. (AMX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +10.77% and carries a Zacks Rank #3. The company is scheduled to report results on Oct 24, after the closing bell. It has a long-term (three-five years) earnings growth rate of a whopping 55.87%.SBA Communications Corp. (SBAC  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +12% and carries a Zacks Rank #3. The company is scheduled to report results on Oct 30. It has a substantial long-term (three-five years) earnings growth rate of 10.60%.Comcast Corp. (CMCSA  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +3.16% and carries a Zacks Rank #3. The company is scheduled to report results on Oct 26. It has an average positive earnings surprise of 7.77% in the last four quarters and a long-term (three-five years) earnings growth rate of 9.50%.Bottom LineChallenges in the form of competitive product introduction and cut-throat pricing pressure will persist in the telecom sector. However, a number of companies in the space have fared well. Picking some outperformers from the space, backed by a solid Zacks Rank and a positive Earnings ESP, could lead investors to gain this earnings season.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - Q1 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation.See Them Free>>

2459,QCOM,"Citrix Systems Inc. (CTXS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 25, after the market closes.In the second quarter of 2017, the company had delivered a positive earnings surprise to the tune of 4%. It also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in terms of revenues.However, things do not look bright for the company in the quarter under review. In fact, the negative sentiment surrounding the stock can be gauged from the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter, which moved down 12.6% over the last 90 days.Moreover, shares of Citrix Systems have struggled lately, underperforming the Zacks Software industry on a year-to-date basis. The stock has been down 7.3%, as against the industry’s rally of 29%.Lets delve deep to find out the factors likely to impact Citrix Systems’ third-quarter results.We expect high costs to hurt the company’s bottom line in the third quarter of 2017. With the company making significant investments to expand its product portfolio, costs are likely to shoot up. Personnel expenses are expected to be high as well, hurting the bottom line. Moreover, Citrix System’s results in the to-be-reported quarter are liable to be affected by foreign exchange movements as it continues to foray into non-U.S. markets.Markedly, the company expects net revenues in the band of $685-$695 million. Earnings per share (on an adjusted basis) are projected in the range of $1.02-$1.05. Both figures compare unfavorably to those reported a year-ago.Revenues from products and licenses are expected to be soft in the quarter under review, thus hurting the top line. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter’s revenues from products and licenses is pegged at $203 million, 3.8% lower than the reported figure in the second quarter of 2017.Amid the gloomy scenario, revenues from Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) are expected to be strong in the quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter SaaS revenues is pegged at $43.6 million, 5.1% higher than reported figure in the second quarter.Given this backdrop, investors would keenly await Citrix Systems’ third-quarter results under its new chief executive officer (CEO) — David J. Henshall – appointed in July 2017. Notably, Henshall has succeeded Kirill Tatarinov, who had joined Citrix from Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report). The appointment of Henshall implies that Citrix has had four CEOs in less than two years. In fact, these frequent changes at its helm have contributed to the stock’s underperformance.We believe that the company’s third-quarter results would be an indicator to whether the appointment of Henshall yields the desired results as Citrix expects to increase its profitability and find favor with shareholders.What Does Our Model Say?Our proven model too does not show that Citrix Systems is likely to beat earnings in this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, that is not the case as highlighted below.Zacks ESP: Citrix Systems has an Earnings ESP of -0.09%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Citrix Systems carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) .As it is we caution against stocks with Zacks Ranks #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Citrix Systems, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Citrix Systems, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Citrix Systems, Inc. QuoteStocks to ConsiderInvestors interested in the broader Computer and Technology sector may consider the following stocks, since our model shows that these companies possess the right combination of elements to come up with an earnings beat this time.QUALCOMM Incorporated (QCOM  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.17% and a Zacks Rank #2.

2460,QCOM,"At the recently concluded WSJ D. Live tech conference organised by The Wall Street Journal, Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM  -  Free Report) reassured that its proposed takeover of NXP Semiconductors NV (NXPI  -  Free Report) is on track. Notably, the deal was facing a few problems.On Oct 27, 2016, Qualcomm had entered into a definitive agreement with the Netherlands-based mobile chipset giant for the latter’s acquisition. Per the deal, Qualcomm would be paying $110 per NXP share in cash, reflecting an enterprise value of approximately $47 billion (equity value of $39 billion) for NXP. The buyout deal is likely to be closed by the end of 2017, subject to all necessary regulatory approvals.In June, the EC (European Commission), the regulatory authority of the European Union, had launched a thorough investigation into the proposed acquisition. The EC will conduct an in-depth probe to see if the deal leads to higher prices, exclusion of rival chipset suppliers and reduced innovation in the semiconductor industry. The merged entity is likely to command a strong market position with an extensive portfolio of baseband chipsets and chips for near-field communications.The EC has time till Oct 17, 2017, to take a decision, although it has twice halted its review in the past -- once in June and again in August. Notably, the proposed merger has already been approved by the U.S. antitrust authorities.On Oct 5, 2017, the U.S. mobile chipset giant had submitted its new proposal to the EC. According to Reuters, “Qualcomm has told regulators it will not acquire NXP's standard essential patents, which the Dutch company can sell to another buyer, the sources said. The company also agreed not to take legal action against third parties related to NXP's near field communication (NFC) patents except for defensive purposes. NXP co-invented NFC chips, which enable mobile phones to be used to pay for goods and store and exchange data.""It is important to note that in September, Qualcomm had extended the period of its previously announced cash tender offer of purchasing all the outstanding common shares of NXP. The tender offer will now expire on Oct. 20, 2017 at 5:00 p.m., New York City time.Notably, hedge fund Elliott Management Corp. and two other large shareholders of NXP have approached the company to renegotiate the terms of the deal, which they consider grossly undervalued. In August, Elliot Management had disclosed to having accumulated shares and derivatives amounting to a 6% stake in NXP Semiconductor. Majority of the company’s shareholders are now reluctant to tender their shares at the rate specified by Qualcomm.Consequently, NXP’s outstanding shares tendered have declined from 17.2% in March to 3.2% in September. Notably, at least 70% of NXP’s total outstanding shares must be tendered to Qualcomm for the deal to click. Hence, it looks quite unlikely to succeed unless Qualcomm adds some sweeteners.NXP Semiconductors is the largest manufacturer of high-performance, mixed-signal mobile chipsets with 14% market share. The company has a strong clientele serving more than 25,000 customers through its direct sales channel and a global network of distribution channel partners. The combined entity is expected to generate annual revenues of more than $30 billion. Also, it is likely to position itself as a strong player in the next-generation mobile chipset segment with a potential market size of $138 billion by 2020.Qualcomm expects the transaction to be significantly accretive to its non-GAAP EPS immediately upon completion. Further, the company expects to generate $500 million of annualized run-rate cost synergies within two years of the transaction’s closure.Advantages to QualcommThe major positive of the contract is that it will enable Qualcomm to diversify its business model. The company is a leader in the mobile chipset market. However, in recent years, markets for smartphones and tablets have gradually slowed down. In addition, these chipset businesses are low-margin in nature. In fact, the company’s business has remained stagnant for the last couple of years.On the other hand, NXP manufactures chips for next-generation automotive, industrial and Internet of Things (IoT) segments. Therefore, its acquisition of NXP will help Qualcomm diversify into highly lucrative end markets such as auto, secured devices, connectivity and secure payments. These segments offer high-margin businesses with strong potential for future growth.The takeover will also push Qualcomm up the ranks to the second position after Intel Corp. (INTC  -  Free Report) in terms of sales in the broader global semiconductor market. Moreover, the combined entity will emerge a formidable challenger to other large semiconductor firms like Broadcom Ltd. (AVGO  -  Free Report), Analog Devices Inc. (ADI) and ARM Holdings.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

2461,QCOM,"Tech has come a long way from the dot-com fiasco to a preferred trade by Wall Street pundits. Computer and software makers are having a ball as the White House’s initiative to trim tax rates are providing the much needed windfall to companies that have mostly hoarded money outside the United States. Republican leaders claim to be united on the tax plan, while the lawmakers, regrettably, have been divided on the same so far this year.Substantial growth in cloud computing and the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, gaming and the launches of increasingly complex smartphones and consumer electronics suggest that the good times for tech will keep rolling, at least for now. Lest we forget, the “FAANGtastic five” – Facebook Inc (FB  -  Free Report), Apple Inc. AAPL, Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report), Netflix, Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report) and Alphabet Inc (GOOGL  -  Free Report) have gained in double digits this year. Amazon, in particular, topped the $1000-a-share level, highlighting the stellar show put up by tech stocks this year.Let us, thus, keep an eye on tech stocks that are likely to make the most of the third-quarter earnings season that has unofficially kicked off this week.Tech Stocks Could Make Billions Under Trump Tax Plan Investors continue to pour money into Internet and tech companies, and the most basic thing that is driving them at this point is taxes. Trump has promised to deliver historic relief to corporate America by lowering tax rates. The corporate tax is expected to be slashed from 35% to 20%. This helps tech multinationals to bring funds held overseas back to the United States at a decreased tax rate. Bringing back the tech companies massive overseas cash pile would let it do a combination of share buybacks, pay dividends and get involved in M&A activities.Let us not forget that tech behemoths Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft MSFT, Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO  -  Free Report) and Oracle ORCL hold 88% of their money overseas to avoid paying the 35% corporate tax rate on earnings. Thus, they are positioned to gain immensely under Trump’s tax reduction plan. Companies like Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co (HPE  -  Free Report) and QUALCOMM, Inc.’s (QCOM  -  Free Report) earnings are also projected to rise around 20.8% and 10.5%, respectively, on a repatriation tax cut, per Strategas Research Partners.The tax plan, in the meanwhile, aims to create three individual tax brackets with rates of 12%, 25% and 35%. The current top rate is 39.6%. The prospect of a cut in personal taxation is also a major driving force in the continued strength of big tech firms. With more cash in hand, investors have more room to invest in such bellwethers. Q3 Should be Good for TechThe third-quarter earnings season, historically, is one of the best seasons for tech stocks.As per hedge fund analytics tool Kensho, 30 days after the start of the third-quarter earnings season, the information technology sector gained an average 4.6% in the last 19 years. Meanwhile, other major sectors including industrials, materials and financials have gained 2.8%, 2.8% and 2.7%, respectively. In fact, the S&P 500 index gained a meagre 2.3% during the said period.Tech stocks had an impressive 2017 so far, while earnings for tech companies in the third quarter are expected to be up 9.7% on 6.7% higher revenues (read more: Handicapping the Q3 Earnings Season).Tech Earnings Preview: Cloud Business is a Game Changer International Business Machines Corp. (IBM  -  Free Report) will lead the tech earnings parade on Oct 17. Can the company break it’s more than five-year long streak of quarterly revenue decline? It’s cloud revenues had increased 15% in the second quarter, but, that too was nowhere close to the triple-digit growth Microsoft witnessed in the same quarter and 40% growth Amazon reported over the last couple of years. This time around the tech major could, however, see a boost in hardware sales on the back of the security-fortified z14 mainframes introduced in July.Things are looking up for SAP SE SAP, which will report before the market opens on Oct 19. It saw 33% growth in cloud revenues and a whopping 70% growth in its S/4 Hana business suite in the second quarter. With little competition in its core market, the software and service provider is expected to see strong results in the third quarter in the aforesaid segments.Meanwhile, all await the releases from Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft on Oct 26. Alphabet’s dominance in the search marketing business seems to be getting stronger with each quarter, while Amazon continues to lead the cloud space. Investors, however, will be keen to see how Diane Greene-led Alphabet does in the cloud business. In the second quarter, Alphabet reported 33% growth to $2.2 billion in the category “other revenues” that includes cloud.Microsoft, in the meantime, has almost doubled in the three-and-a-half years since Nadella took over as CEO. The big question is whether the company can maintain growth in its cloud business. So, all eyes are on its Azure product. After all, if we combine Azure and other software-as-a-service products, Microsoft will gain an edge over Amazon in the cloud business.5 Solid ChoicesTechnology companies, nevertheless, are likely to see solid growth in Q3 on the back of favorable government policy. This calls for investing in five tech stocks, which are expected to report a significant uptick in Q3 earnings. These stocks have a positive Earnings ESP.

2462,QCOM,"The week ended Sep 1, 2017, remained encouraging for the stock market as investors were seen shrugging off news like heightening tension between the United States and North Korea, as well as the dismal job data for August. Despite this, Ambarella Inc. (AMBA  -  Free Report) was among the worst performers as the company has been facing challenges which are expected to hinder its growth opportunities in the near term.Ambarella manufactures video compression and image processing technology that is used in a variety of small cameras, computers and mobile phones. The company has a diversified product line, offering devices which fit into five main markets — Security Cameras, Automotive Cameras, Sports & Flying Cameras, Wearable Cameras, and Broadcast Infrastructure Systems.Shares of this chip maker plunged more than 20% last week. In fact, the stock has been among the worst performer in the industry to which it belongs to in the year-to-date period. During the said period, Ambarella has lost 22% of its value, while the industry has gained 27.3%.What’s Behind the Latest Downtrend?The downtrend is mainly due to the company’s recently provided disappointing outlook for the third quarter and fiscal 2018. The company projects a decline in the third-quarter fiscal 2018 revenues, the first after five consecutive quarters of year-over-year growth. Apart from this, it also lowered its revenue outlook for the full fiscal.During the fiscal second-quarter conference call held last Thursday, the company noted that a “substantial decline in GoPro revenues and a moderate decline in the drone market” would adversely affect its next quarter’s top-line performance. However, Ambarella anticipates strong year-over-year revenue growth in IP security (both professional and consumer), as well as solid growth in automotive and non-sports wearable.Challenges Hindering Growth Opportunities The company faces three main challenges which may hinder its growth prospects.Firstly, Ambarella, most noted for its sports camera technology, is set to lose its largest customer — GoPro (GPRO  -  Free Report). The company produces a video processing chip, which is a main component in the popular brand of GoPro action cameras. GoPro produces water resistant, wearable, high-definition cameras which produce unique first-person videos and have been taking the Internet by storm for the last few years.However, Ambarella, during its fiscal first-quarter results, warned about a possible decline in revenues from GoPro in fiscal 2018. It reaffirmed the same concretely during the fiscal second-quarter conference call as well. This is because, per the company, GoPro is using a chip from a competitor in its new camera, which will hurt Ambarella’s shipment volumes, resulting in revenue decline in the second half of the fiscal.Secondly, prevailing weakness in the drone market has been denting this chip maker’s revenues. The company witnessed two back-to-back quarters of decline in this market. Moreover, Ambarella projects the softness in the drone market to persist throughout fiscal 2018.Thirdly, the company is facing a new challenge in the form of Qualcomm Incorporated (QCOM  -  Free Report). It should be noted that Qualcomm is also looking to expand its product portfolio in order to cope with its declining share in the mobile chipset market. It is set to acquire NXP Semiconductors (NXPI  -  Free Report), which is the world’s biggest automotive chipmaker. This acquisition is likely to help Qualcomm in expanding its foothold in new markets such as wearables, automotive, drones and other Internet of Things devices. The entry of Qualcomm is a real threat as Ambarella may find it difficult to win new deals and might, as well, lose some of its customers.Currently, Ambarella carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2463,QCOM,"Telecom service provider, Ericsson (ERIC  -  Free Report), Verizon (VZ  -  Free Report), and Qualcomm Technologies, a subsidiary of Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM  -  Free Report) recently exceeded the Gigabit speed barrier. The companies are the first in their industry to come up with commercial silicon and network infrastructure with 1.07 Gbps (gigabits per second) download speed.During an Ericsson lab trial, these companies used the Qualcomm SnapdragonTM X20 LTE Modem to achieve the feat. These speeds fall under the companies’ current evolution of the LTE technology.The companies achieved the 1.07 Gbps speed by using three 20MHz carriers of FDD (Frequency Division Duplex using separate transmit and receive frequencies) spectrum. This will enable the companies to reach new levels of spectral efficiency for commercial networks and devices, which in turn will allow the delivery of the Gigabit class experience to more customers and support new wireless innovations.The Gigabit LTE solution for Ericsson and Cable & Wireless Communications includes carrier aggregation, higher order modulation (256-QAM) and 4X4 MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) which uses optimized data speeds for wireless broadband subscribers.Ericsson, being one of the premier telecom services providers, is much in demand among operators to expand network coverage and upgrade networks for higher speed and capacity. Notably, Ericsson is the world’s largest supplier of LTE technology with a significant market share and has established a large number of LTE networks worldwide. As operators continue to invest in telecom core networks for the deployment of new service offerings such as Voice over LTE, Ericsson stands to benefit significantly from it.The company is also investing in R&D to increase its competitiveness in Networks business. As a matter of fact, Ericsson is enthusiastic about the turnaround of the Chinese market in terms of 4G deployment and believes this will be a significant growth driver, going forward. The company is witnessing immense interest for the new Ericsson Radio System – its new platform which enables customers to upgrade to narrow band IOT and 5G just through software upgrade.However, uncertain markets, reduced consumer telecom spending and delayed auctions of spectrums pose significant threats to Ericsson. Unfortunately, these conditions are expected to persist through 2017. Also, the company is facing an increased risk of market and customer project adjustments, which can have a huge negative impact on its operating income in the quarters ahead.In light of the above concerns, Ericsson’s shares have lost 9.3% over the past six months, much worse than the industry’s average decline of 1.4%.Considering the growth drivers and the risks that the company faces, we have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) on Ericsson.Stock to ConsiderA better-ranked stock in the industry is Motorola Solutions, Inc. (MSI  -  Free Report), with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

2464,QCOM,"Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM  -  Free Report) recently filed a lawsuit in China against Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) to halt sales and manufacture of iPhone in the country, per a Bloomberg report. In a lawsuit filed in Beijing intellectual property court, the largest mobile chipset manufacturer using baseband technology globally, claimed that Apple infringed Qualcomm’s patent and uses technologies invented by it without paying for them.Qualcomm’s arguments are based on three non-standard essential patents covering power management and Fore Touch touch-screen technology, which Apple uses in its latest iPhones. Qualcomm generates majority of its revenues from mobile chipset manufacturing. However, major part of its profit comes from patent licensing that cover the fundamentals of next-generation mobile phone systems.On the other hand, iPhone accounts for more than two-third of Apple’s revenues. Importantly, China is the largest smatphone market of the world and a major country for production of these devices. Therefore, any negative court verdict in China could hurt Apple significantly.Legal tussle between Qualcomm and Apple is not new. In Jan 2017, Qualcomm was slapped with a $1 billion lawsuit related to licensing royalty payments by the tech giant. In the suit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, Apple accused Qualcomm of overcharging for chips and refusing to pay some $1 billion in promised rebates. This lawsuit continues to get bitter, which is badly affecting Qualcomm’s margins.In May 2017, Qualcomm settled a licensing dispute with BlackBerry Limited  by paying $940 million. Moreover, just a few days ago, the company has been fined around $23.4 billion Taiwan dollars (approximately U.S. $773 million) by the Taiwan Fair Trade Commission on grounds of anti-trust violations of its chip technology.On the other hand, Qualcomm recently revised its proposed deal to take over NXP Semiconductors N.V. (NXPI  -  Free Report) in order to get the nod from the European Commission (EC), which is the regulatory authority of European Union. Notably, Qualcomm’s proposed acquisition of NXP Semiconductors is facing a few problems.Price Performance of QualcommQualcomm’s shares have decreased 6.45% compared with the industry’s decline of 2.72% in the last three months. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2465,QCOM,"Believe it or not, Broadcom (AVGO  -  Free Report) is looking to buy Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report), at least according to people familiar with the matter. But if the rumors are right, the company could pay $70-$80 a share in cash and stock, valuing the company at over a $100 billion, the largest semiconductor deal ever. It’s possible that regulators will not approve the deal on competitive considerations, but just in case they don’t, there’s much going for both the companies-  Rationale for the DealThere are a number of reasons why the deal makes sense.  First, Qualcomm is one of the largest semiconductor companies, as is Broadcom, so their combination will create a semiconductor giant like Intel or Samsung with greater resources to tap emerging opportunities.Second, being the leading supplier of modem chips having also made some progress in 5G, Qualcomm brings Broadcom important technology to round out its portfolio. Not only that – there is very little product overlap despite the fact that both target the market for mobile devices. Smartphone growth rates have been coming down recently because of increased penetration, but other markets like IoT, self-driving cars, artificial intelligence and cloud computing continue to emerge. A combined company with much greater product breadth, a larger client roster and scope for greater integration of technology should do better in this landscape.   Third, Qualcomm has a large number of standard essential patents that it licenses on the basis of fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory (FRAND) terms. It also has several other patents that do not form part of standards but that it bundles with standard essential patents. So on the one hand, Qualcomm shouldn’t have to license all patents at standard essential rates, while on the other, it needs to offer greater clarity on the amount it’s charging for the non-standard technology that forms part of the bundle. It also needs to allow companies to build or second source their own non-standard technology.The practice has drawn ire from a number of foreign governments and now, Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) and its suppliers have ganged up against it. What’s worse, Apple is roping in others like Samsung, so Qualcomm’s legal problems are mounting. Apple phones use Qualcomm technology, but Apple and its suppliers have also stopped paying Qualcomm on this pretext while second sourcing from Intel.This has of course been a big blow to Qualcomm’s revenue and profits. The acquisition has the potential to bring another big semiconductor player on Qualcomm’s side. It can also lead to a resolution of the conflict.Fourth, Broadcom management has a lot of experience with acquisitions, which have been the most consistent pillar of growth for the company. The biggest of these was the Avago-Broadcom merger, which retained the Broadcom name post closure. Before that, it made more than 50 smaller acquisitions over the course of a decade. Management is also known for cost control, so the combined entity may see greater fiscal discipline, which could be a good way to extract profits.Fifth, the chances of prolonged litigation have pressured Qualcomm’s share prices, so the deal will be a good return on investment for shareholders.    Possible Deal BreakersBoth Qualcomm and Broadcom are in the middle of other acquisitions. Qualcomm is looking to buy NXP, the shareholders of which are asking for a higher price. Broadcom is trying to acquire Brocade  (a much smaller deal). There could be many glitches along the way.   The second concern is regulatory. Qualcomm is quite a dominant player in its own field and Broadcom further expands that field. In a way, since they aren’t competitors, there may not be anti-competitive concerns. But on the other hand, the two together will be a mobile chip making powerhouse, which may be something regulators will consider.  Last WordsThese may be some of the biggest acquisitions we have talked about, but consolidation in the space will likely continue in the foreseeable future because chip development and verification isn’t getting any cheaper. Also, companies generally compete on their ability to deliver energy efficient chips that are also more powerful, fast and durable while being cheap. This naturally benefits larger players that can invest heavily in R&D and then manufacture on scale.On the other hand, some of the biggest propositions have been shot down by regulators, such as Applied Materials’ attempt to buy Tokyo Electron, or more recently, Lam Research’s (LRCX  -  Free Report) attempt to buy KLA-Tencor (KLAC  -  Free Report).Broadcom has apparently been trying to acquire Qualcomm for some time, but its previous attempts weren’t attractive to Qualcomm management. Given its current problems, the company may be more willing to go for it.Broadcom has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) while Qualcomm has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2467,QCOM,"The United States national wireless carrier, T-Mobile US Inc. (TMUS  -  Free Report) has launched promotional offers for two new LG handsets, G6 and V20.The operator launched buy-one, get-one-free deals on both G6 and the V20 for users who buy phones on T-Mobile’s equipment installment plans. Customers who add a line will receive a rebate in the form of a prepaid MasterCard of up to $500. The LG G6 handset is priced at $500, while the V20 carries a $480 price tag through T-Mobile.Earlier this month, T-Mobile US had unveiled its first branded smartphone, the REVVL and promoted more models on its JUMP! On Demand handset leasing programme.  Accompanying the phone’s launch, the company has also adjusted its JUMP! On Demand. T-Mobile US is marketing it as an affordable option because it'll only cost $5 a month with no down payment through the company's Jump! On Demand service, or $125 up front.Sprint’s Similar MoveOn a similar note, Sprint Corp. (S  -  Free Report) offered a $260 discount on the Essential PH-1, to leverage its exclusive deal to carry the first phone from Essential Products. Sprint will be the exclusive network carrier for the new phone Essential PH-1. Essential PH-1 will be available in Sprint’s retail stores, its online and telemarketing channels and through Best Buy Co. Inc. (BBY).The Essential PH-1 is a high-end smartphone that supports Android software developed by Alphabet Inc.’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) Google. The handset features a Qualcomm Inc.’s (QCOM  -  Free Report) Snapdragon 835 processor, a 128 GB internal storage and a 360-degree camera. Essential PH-1 is priced at $700 and is slated to ship in the next few weeks.Winding UpThe promotions by T-Mobile and Sprint will open up opportunities for U.S. operators and their handset partners.. More smartphones are expected to be released from heavyweights like Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Samsung and Google, while Motorola is expected to refresh its handset lineup as it adds carrier partners.The domestic smartphone market soared 14% year over year in the second quarter of 2017. Demand for prepaid and postpaid handsets rebounded after a discouraging performance in 2016, as per latest data from market research firm, Counterpoint Technology Market Research.U.S. carriers reported nearly 1.25 million net postpaid phone additions during the quarter, with Verizon’s net gain of 614,000 postpaid and 19,000 prepaid wireless customers, which is a major comeback. We believe that this huge user addition came on the back of Verizon’s impressive unlimited data plans.The increasing competition will intensify in the coming weeks as carriers seek to leverage new phones to expand their market share in advance of the crucial holiday shopping season.Such launches combined with attractive promotional offers will lure customers from rival carriers.With increasing smartphone launches, we expect aggressive promotions by the company which may impede margins in the coming quarters.

2470,QCOM,"On this first day of November — following a robust October, which was the best trading month since February — the ADP (ADP  -  Free Report) private-sector payroll wastes no time shedding light from the month of October from labor market activity. This also means Friday will bring us the non-farm payroll report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) which together bring us more or less up to date on the health of the domestic jobs market.The latest ADP headline number was well out in front of expectations: 235K new private-sector jobs filled well surpassed the 190K analysts had expected. However, September’s total was revised downward by 25K new jobs to 110K overall. Averaging the two months — which may be useful in helping comb-out anomalies related to the two major hurricanes that struck the continental U.S. shores several weeks ago — we come up with 170K. This is still far stronger than what the economy “needs” to continue strengthening the U.S. labor market.Pointing toward the post-hurricane rebuild, the sector breakdown shows 62K Construction jobs having been created in the month, the top job-creating industry last month, followed by the steadily growing Leisure/Hospitality and Education/Healthcare results of 45K and 39K, respectively. Goods-producing jobs reached 85K while Services maintained its strong advantage at 150K jobs in October.The estimate for Friday’s BLS report is 315K. This is an impressive headline, but also may be susceptible to the same hurricane-related affects, including downward revisions. Somewhere in the high 100Ks is where analysts are looking for that two-month average to wind up.Bitcoin’s Record HighThe CME Group (CME  -  Free Report) announced it will launch a futures trading platform on the Bitcoin cryptocurrency sometime before year’s end. Bitcoin has been hard to ignore in 2017, trading up nearly 500% year to date, and currently trades at an all-time high near 6500. Not too shabby for a product without any federal government backing anywhere in the word, and with plenty of high-powered naysayers like JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon.Huge Day for Q3 EarningsAfter the closing bell today, we will see earnings results from a metric ton of notable companies in big tech and elsewhere. Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) and Tesla (TSLA  -  Free Report) and the two marquee names, but this afternoon also includes Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report), Kraft-Heinz (KHC  -  Free Report), Fitbit (FIT  -  Free Report), Shake Shack (SHAK  -  Free Report) and dozens of others. Q3 earnings season is again bearing out market strength, even among small-cap stocks, as this interview with Tracey Ryniec and Zacks Director of Research Sheraz Mian illustrates: Is This a Buying Opportunity in Small-Cap Stocks?Ahead of today’s opening bell, specialty retailer Estee Lauder (EL  -  Free Report) is up 7% on a strong fiscal Q1 2018 quarter which saw earnings rise 42% year over year and revenues up 14%. $1.21 per share topped the 98 cents in the Zacks consensus, and sales of $3,274 million outperformed our estimate of $3,164 million. Estee Lauder also raised its earnings guidance for both Q2 and full-year 2018.Consumer discretionary giant Clorox Group (CLX  -  Free Report) also outperformed its fiscal Q1 2018 expectations during today’s pre-market, posting $1.46 per share for a 5-cent beat on $1.50 billion in quarterly sales, ahead of the $1.48 billion anticipated. However, the company shaved down full-year estimates for both sales and earnings. Shares are up 1% ahead of the opening bell.Specialty tech products firm Garmin (GRMN  -  Free Report) also beat estimates on its top and bottom lines this morning: 75 cents per share topped the 66 cents expected, and revenues of $743 million outpaced the $718 in the Zacks consensus. The company also raised guidance, and we see shares up 4.7% in today’s pre-market.

This also means Friday will bring us the non-farm payroll report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) which together bring us more or less up to date on the health of the domestic jobs market.The latest ADP headline number was well out in front of expectations: 235K new private-sector jobs filled well surpassed the 190K analysts had expected. However, September’s total was revised downward by 25K new jobs to 110K overall. Averaging the two months — which may be useful in helping comb-out anomalies related to the two major hurricanes that struck the continental U.S. shores several weeks ago — we come up with 170K. This is still far stronger than what the economy “needs” to continue strengthening the U.S. labor market.Pointing toward the post-hurricane rebuild, the sector breakdown shows 62K Construction jobs having been created in the month, the top job-creating industry last month, followed by the steadily growing Leisure/Hospitality and Education/Healthcare results of 45K and 39K, respectively. Goods-producing jobs reached 85K while Services maintained its strong advantage at 150K jobs in October.The estimate for Friday’s BLS report is 315K. This is an impressive headline, but also may be susceptible to the same hurricane-related affects, including downward revisions. Somewhere in the high 100Ks is where analysts are looking for that two-month average to wind up.Bitcoin’s Record HighThe CME Group (CME  -  Free Report) announced it will launch a futures trading platform on the Bitcoin cryptocurrency sometime before year’s end. Bitcoin has been hard to ignore in 2017, trading up nearly 500% year to date, and currently trades at an all-time high near 6500. Not too shabby for a product without any federal government backing anywhere in the word, and with plenty of high-powered naysayers like JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon.Huge Day for Q3 EarningsAfter the closing bell today, we will see earnings results from a metric ton of notable companies in big tech and elsewhere. Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) and Tesla (TSLA  -  Free Report) and the two marquee names, but this afternoon also includes Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report), Kraft-Heinz (KHC  -  Free Report), Fitbit (FIT  -  Free Report), Shake Shack (SHAK  -  Free Report) and dozens of others. Q3 earnings season is again bearing out market strength, even among small-cap stocks, as this interview with Tracey Ryniec and Zacks Director of Research Sheraz Mian illustrates: Is This a Buying Opportunity in Small-Cap Stocks?Ahead of today’s opening bell, specialty retailer Estee Lauder (EL  -  Free Report) is up 7% on a strong fiscal Q1 2018 quarter which saw earnings rise 42% year over year and revenues up 14%. $1.21 per share topped the 98 cents in the Zacks consensus, and sales of $3,274 million outperformed our estimate of $3,164 million. Estee Lauder also raised its earnings guidance for both Q2 and full-year 2018.Consumer discretionary giant Clorox Group (CLX  -  Free Report) also outperformed its fiscal Q1 2018 expectations during today’s pre-market, posting $1.46 per share for a 5-cent beat on $1.50 billion in quarterly sales, ahead of the $1.48 billion anticipated. However, the company shaved down full-year estimates for both sales and earnings. Shares are up 1% ahead of the opening bell.Specialty tech products firm Garmin (GRMN  -  Free Report) also beat estimates on its top and bottom lines this morning: 75 cents per share topped the 66 cents expected, and revenues of $743 million outpaced the $718 in the Zacks consensus. The company also raised guidance, and we see shares up 4.7% in today’s pre-market.Mark VickerySenior EditorQuestions or comments about this article and/or its author?

2472,QCOM,"Featuring possibly the biggest product launches of the year, the Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) event, scheduled at 1 PM Eastern Time, will have investors and tech aficionados glued to their screens. New iPhone models, including the iPhone X, and other devices like a new Apple watch are likely to be released during its course.Ahead of the event, a blog post from Qualcomm, Inc. (QCOM  -  Free Report) has claimed that it was the first to usher in the most-recent cellphone innovations along with its Android platform partners. Given Qualcomm’s disputes with the iPhone maker, the timing of this announcement only serves to highlight the importance of the event.It comes as no surprise then that several major technology names such as NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report), which released new Mac compatible components in April, will be watching with bated breath. The success of these new Apple devices is likely to determine the performance of several of these companies to a considerable degree.This is therefore as good a time as any to see how Apple stacks up against Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL  -  Free Report) whose Android devices have captured an appreciably larger share of the smartphone market. With market capitalizations of $834 billion and $648 billion, respectively, these are the largest companies listed in the United States. Both stocks have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here . Price PerformanceShares of both Apple and Alphabet have been strong performers this year, easily outperforming the S&P 500’s gain of 11.1%. However, with an increase of 39.4% year to date, Apple has surged ahead of Alphabet which is only up 19% over the same period. ValuationHere, we are utilizing the stocks’ Price to Earnings Growth (PEG) ratios in order to evaluate them from a valuation perspective. This is the most appropriate ratio since it takes into account the differences in growth witnessed among high growth tech stocks. Additionally, it takes into account the future earnings potential of companies.Both Apple and Alphabet have lower PEG values than the S&P 500’s reading of 1.85. However, Apple is significantly undervalued, since its PEG of 1.33 is lower than Alphabet’s figure of 1.52.Gross MarginCompared to other industries, tech companies have relatively higher gross margin levels. This is particularly true for those stocks which have higher brand value. The reason for such a phenomenon is possibly the lower volume of physical materials and smaller workforce required for such companies.  At first glance, Apple does poorly on this count, since its gross margin TTM is 38.5% compared to the S&P 500’s level of 48.4%. Alphabet seems to excel when it comes to profitability, with a gross margin TTM of 60.2%.But the picture changes completely if we undertake comparisons with their respective broader industries. Alphabet provides a significantly lower level of gross margin compared with the industry average of 70.7%.Meanwhile, Apple’s gross margin is significantly better than the industry average of 37.2%.Earnings HistoryApple reported spectacular results for third-quarter fiscal 2017, driven by the impressive Service segment performance. Earnings of $1.67 per share and revenues of $45.4 billion surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.57 and $44.7 billion, respectively. On a year-over-year basis, earnings grew 17.6% and revenues increased 7.2%. (Read: Apple Q3 Earnings & Revenues Beat Estimates, Stock Up)Coming to Alphabet, second-quarter diluted non-GAAP earnings of $8.90 exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.17. Also, earnings were up 15.1% sequentially and 27.1% year over year. Gross total revenue of $26 billion was up 5.1% sequentially and 21% year over year (up 23% in constant currency or CC). (Read: Alphabet Beats Earnings & Revenue Estimates in Q2)Considering a more comprehensive earnings history, Alphabet has delivered positive surprises in three of the trailing four quarters. Apple is ahead on this count, having delivered positive surprises in all of the trailing four quarters. However, Amazon has a higher average surprise of 5.1%, compared to Apple’s reading of 3.8%. Also, the last earnings surprise for Alphabet was 5.6%, significantly higher than Apple’s level of 0.6%.Estimate Revisions and ESPApple stands out when considering estimate revisions. The stock’s earnings estimate for the current year has improved by 1.2% over the last 60 days. In contrast, Alphabet’s earnings estimate has declined by 8.5% over the same period, making Apple the better choice on this front. Apple maintains its dominance on the Earnings ESP front with a reading of 2.7%, compared to Alphabet’s reading of -2.6%.ConclusionOur comparative analysis shows that Alphabet outperforms Apple when considering average earnings surprise and gross margins. However, the gross margin advantage fades on comparing Alphabet with its relevant broader industry. Ultimately, Apple holds an edge over Alphabet when considering price performance, PEG ratios, Earnings ESP as well as gross margin relative to its broader industry. This is why it may be better to bet on Apple over Alphabet as the landmark iPhone launch approaches.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!                   It could become the mother of all technological revolutions. Apple sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years, creating a $1.7 trillion market.Zacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this fast-emerging phenomenon and 6 tickers for taking advantage of it.

2473,QCOM,"Shares of leading wireless chipset manufacturer, Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM  -  Free Report) tumbled to a 52-week low of $48.92 during the trading session on Sep 8. However, the figure recovered marginally to close at $49.64, down 1.47%.Over the past 52 weeks, shares of Qualcomm have ranged from a low of $48.92 to a high of $71.62. Average volume of shares traded over the last three months is approximately 8.59 million.Why the Downturn?Qualcomm has been facing regulatory proceedings of late. The company continues to receive charges for unfair business practices and licensing royalty payments. In May 2017, Qualcomm settled a licensing dispute with BlackBerry Limited  by paying $940 million. Earlier in December 2016, South Korea's regulatory authority for economic competition, Korea Fair Trade Commission (""KFTC""), imposed an administrative fine of approximately 1.03 trillion South Korean Won (approximately $865 million) on Qualcomm due to unfair business practices. Meanwhile, the ongoing $1 billion lawsuit dispute with tech giant Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) continues to get bitter with time, which is badly affecting the company’s margins.Aggressive competition in the mobile phone chipset market has also been hurting Qualcomm’s profits. The company faces severe competitive threats from its closest rival, Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report), which has been redesigning chipsets for the mobile computing market. We wait to see if this hurts Qualcomm’s sales in the fiscal second quarter.We believe that stiff competition, stringent regulatory norms along with anti-competitive and unfair business practices charges are reasons behind the decrease in the company’s share pricePrice PerformanceOver the past month, shares of Qualcomm have declined 7.3% compared with the industry’s decline of 5.6%. Estimates on the DownswingWe note that the sales and Earnings Per Share (EPS) estimate for Qualcomm has moved down for the remaining quarters of 2017 and also for full-year 2017.The sales growth for third-quarter 2017 and fourth-quarter 2017 is estimated to decelerate 6.5% and 1.0%, respectively. For 2017, sales is expected to drop 2.8%.The EPS growth for third-quarter 2017 and fourth-quarter 2017 is estimated to decelerate 37.1% and 27%, respectively. For fiscal 2017, EPS is expected to drop 6.1%.The downward estimate revisions reflect pessimism over prospects of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Certainly Not a Broker’s FavoriteGiven the challenges faced by the company, the stock is not a favorite pick for brokers right now.Over the last 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of earnings for third-quarter 2017 and fourth-quarter 2017 has gone down 15.6% to 81 cents per share and 23% to 87 cents, respectively. Likewise, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 has plummeted 17 cents to $4.17 per share.Given the wealth of information at the disposal of brokers, it is in the best interests of investors to be guided by broker’s advice and the direction of their estimate revisions. Notably, the direction of estimate revisions serves as an important pointer when it comes to the price of a stock.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

2475,QCOM,"Netflix Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report) has signed a multi-year deal with one of the most successful television producers, Shonda Rhimes, the name behind popular shows like Grey’s Anatomy and Scandal. Her production company Shondaland, run by Rhimes and her partner Betsy Beers, will oversee a new series and other projects.Reportedly, Rhimes has ended her 15-year tenure with Walt Disney’s (DIS  -  Free Report) ABC studios to produce original content exclusively for Netflix. Per The Wall Street Journal, Rhimes’s work “has generated more than 2 billion in revenues from advertising, rerun sales and international licensing” for ABC. We can thus anticipate a similar impact on Netflix as well.Focus on Original ContentReportedly, Netflix has renewed the series Ozark for a 10-episode second season. Last week, the company announced an unnamed talk show by the prolific David Letterman and a Western anthology series by Oscar-winning Coen brothers set to release in 2018.We believe that the company’s continued focus on producing more quality original content is driving its top line. Reportedly, there will be 40 original movies this year, with expenditure on original content expected to touch $6 billion in addition to another billion dollars on marketing.Its improving content portfolio will drive subscriber growth and further boost the stock price. Notably, shares of Netflix have gained 34.5% year to date, significantly outperforming the industry's 13.4% rally.        Moreover, expanding original content portfolio is anticipated to provide competitive leverage against the likes of Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) Prime, Hulu and Time Warner’s HBO. Impressive Subscriber Growth In the last quarter, Netflix added over 5.2 million subscribers, much more than the expected 3.2 million. The company’s focus on international expansion and original regional content has paid off, with 4.14 million net new additions overseas in the quarter.Further, the company remains confident of adding more subscribers as the trend of binge viewing catches up fast. In the third quarter, Netflix expects to add 0.75 million subscribers in the domestic streaming segment and 3.65 million in the international segment.Moreover, the company expects to report profits from International operations in the quarter, which is a positive, in our view.Netflix, Inc.

2476,QCOM,"Q2 earnings season is finally here, and the next few weeks promise to be extremely busy throughout the global markets. As always, these earnings reports will give us a better picture of the latest consumer trends and the overall state of the economy, which means it’s incredibly important for investors to stay tuned in right now.But with thousands of earnings releases pouring in over the next month or so, it can be hard to keep track of when the most important companies are reporting.With that said, investors can always use the Zacks Earnings Calendar to plan out their schedules for earnings, dividend announcements, and other important financial releases. This handy tool is your perfect one-stop-shop to properly prepare for the market events that will have an impact on your own portfolio.And today, we’ve made that task even easier for you. Using the Earnings Calendar, we looked ahead to next week—one of the first truly packed weeks for earnings—and selected the biggest reports to watch. Make sure to keep an eye on these companies as they prepare to report during the week of July 17:· Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report)) – Monday, July 17 – After Market CloseVideo streaming giant Netflix is set to release its second-quarter fiscal 2017 earnings results after the bell on Monday. Our Zacks Consensus Estimates currently call for earnings of $0.16 per share and revenue of $2.76 billion, which would represent year-over-year growth rates of 74% and 31%, respectively.The company is expected to add about 600 thousand domestic subscribers and 2.6 million international subscribers, bringing the streamer’s total membership count comfortably above 102 million. The stock is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), but with an Earnings ESP of 0%, surprise prediction is more difficult. Nevertheless, Netflix has surpassed its earnings estimates by an average of 118% in each of the trailing four quarters. · Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report)) – Tuesday, July 18 – Before Market OpenInvestment banking behemoth Goldman Sachs is scheduled to report its second-quarter 2017 financial results before the market opens on July 18. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings sits at $3.51 per share, while our consensus revenue estimate calls for $7.57 billion. These figures would reflect year-over-year slumps of about 6% and 5%, respectively.Last quarter, Goldman missed earnings estimates by 4.3%, partially because of lower trading revenues. That issue is expected to be a problem again, and with several negative estimate revisions dragging the stock down to a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), this financial powerhouse is looking risky as we head towards its report. · Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report)) – Wednesday, July 19 – After Market CloseQualcomm, a leader in the global semiconductor industry, is scheduled to report is fiscal third-quarter earnings after the market closes on July 19. Despite the overall strength of the semiconductor space, our Zacks Consensus Estimates call for earnings of $0.67 per share, a 35% drop from the year-ago quarter, and revenues of $5.22 billion, a nearly 14% slump.The company is currently locked in a heated legal battle with Apple (AAPL), and it was forced to update its guidance to exclude royalty revenues from Apple’s contract manufacturers. This has sent the company’s earnings estimates lower, which has contributed to its Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) position. Nevertheless, Qualcomm has been a consistent performer, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 14% in each of the trailing four quarters. · Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report)) – Thursday, July 20 – After Market CloseSoftware pioneer Microsoft is slated to report its fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 earnings results after the bell next Thursday. Our current Zacks Consensus Estimates call for earnings of 71 cents per share and revenues of $24.19 billion. These results would represent year-over-year growth of about 2% and 17%, respectively.Over the past few years, Microsoft has pivoted away from a PC-minded, software sales business and towards a more cloud-focused model. The insane growth of its Azure cloud division has been well-documented, and investors can be certain that this unit will continue to be a major factor. But although the company currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), its negative Earnings ESP makes surprise prediction challenging. Of course, these are just a few of the several hundred companies that are expected to report next week. However, these major announcements should provide investors with a better sense of how earnings season is going across the board.

2477,QCOM,"Though last week wasn’t been too eventful for telecom companies, a few developments were worth noting.Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report) is reportedly launching customer-friendly prepaid family plans to attract more subscribers. Prepaid lines include unlimited talk, text and data tiers along with 3GB, 7GB, 10GB and Unlimited data. Each data size is priced separately for the first line, followed by discounted rate from second to fifth lines to help cut down on costs.  With Verizon’s new service, customers can choose a single specific plan for each member of the family, enabling them to customize individual monthly data plans.Moreover, the U.S. telecom behemoth is reportedly merging its video-streaming service, Go 90, into other digital platforms. Go90’s primary content strategy is now focused on video content that slots between the less-than-10-minute clips, which dominate social media and the more-than-30-minute shows and films popular on SVODs (subscription video-on-demand) like Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report), Hulu and Netflix Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report).Meanwhile, Verizon and T-Mobile US Inc. (TMUS  -  Free Report) are offering latest versions of Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL to attract customers. Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL are the latest series of Alphabet Inc.’s (GOOGL) Google smartphones. Both the phones will come with Android 8.0 Oreo mobile operating system.In a separate development, T-Mobile US recently requested for Special Temporary Authority (STA) from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to test pre-commercial LTE Advanced (LTE-A) in El Paso, Texas, and Augusta, Georgia.

In April, Verizon introduced its unlimited prepaid plan with unlimited data, talk and text for $80 a month. Video streaming was limited up to 480p. The wireless prepaid industry is getting more competitive with every passing day. The industry is also struggling with saturation issues. The gap between prepaid and postpaid average revenue per user has narrowed significantly, forcing telecom biggies to turn their attention to domestic prepaid mobile service business.

Till date, almost 15% of Go90's content (mostly originals) has been distributed to AOL Video. AOL Inc. — a major player in the digital content and online advertising space — was acquired by Verizon in June 2015. Verizon has further plans to expand this effort to Yahoo's brands before the end of the year. In fact, the company is beginning to distribute Go90 content across some of its Oath brands.

In June 2017, the EC had launched a thorough investigation into the proposed acquisition. The EC will probe in depth to see if the deal will lead to higher prices, exclusion of rival chipset suppliers and reduced innovation in the semiconductor industry. The merged entity is likely to command strong market positions with an extensive portfolio of baseband chipsets and chips for near-field communications.

The soundless videos last only a few seconds.Next up is a brand new Pixelbook laptop with a keyboard that folds all the way back to turn the 12.3-inch touchscreen into a tablet. It will feature Google Assistant and support Snap’s Snapchat. The device will be in stores on Oct 31.Google also announced a couple of new smart home speakers. The first, called Google Home Mini, is a $49 device pitted against Amazon’s Echo Dot. It will be available on Oct. 19. The second is called Home Max, perhaps because it offers decibels more suitable for parties. The device comes for $399 and should ship by year end.Google is bringing AI to its product range through Assistant. The company is new to the hardware space so has inconsequential market share, but with strengthening prospects in the classroom and at enterprises, a hardware push at this time makes sense on multiple levels. Google also needs to feed the effort if it is to compete effectively with Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) and Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) in this area.Facebook’s Russia ChapterFacebook has faced some flak after the company announced that there were around 3,000 politically divisive ads on its social media platform by Russian agencies with the apparent purpose of meddling in U.S. elections. Around 46% of these ads were seen before the elections with the balance having been seen thereafter.The thing concerning law makers and others is that around 10 million people have already seen the ads. Facebook is taking steps to try and prevent a recurrence by Russians or others, but it clearly won’t be an easy task given that there are 5 million advertisers on the platform. There’s also the problem of distinguishing between free speech and a malafide intention to influence crowds.At any rate, the company said that it would hire a thousand more people to review ads and ensure they meet its terms. It also stated that its ad review system was being changed with increased focus on not just the content of an ad, but also the context in which it was bought and the intended audience. There will also be an attempt to gather bonafide documentation to clearly identify advertisers.For good measure, Facebook also intends to remove videos showing murder, suicide and other violent acts. It isn’t clear yet if these actions will amount to censorship of the platform by violent groups, thus curbing free speech.Meanwhile, the company, along with other technology players has been called to testify before congressional panels investigating the issue on Nov 1. CEO Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg may not attend, however, as it coincides with the day the company is set to report earnings and also because senators are likely to want someone who could most capably describe the technical aspects of what happened, Bloomberg reports.EU Tax Issue Weighs on Technology Companies Technology companies have for years been avoiding tax payments on their European businesses by making use of complicated tax avoidance procedures. Accordingly, they form a subsidiary in a country where tax is exempt or very low. They then transfer some patents to this subsidiary.European headquarters are built in places like Ireland and Luxembourg, which typically attract foreign investors by offering tax incentives. So the companies first lower their taxes by arranging their incidence in a low-tax zone, then transfer the income to the subsidiary set up in a zero-tax country. They don’t repatriate the cash into the U.S. so they don’t have to pay taxes there either.The EU, under its current chief Margrethe Vestager, has been going after member countries one at a time to ensure that taxes are not collected in a way that prevents free competition between the member countries. So it has been initiating and fighting cases in not just Ireland and Luxembourg (though these are the main wrong doers), but also Belgium and the Netherlands.Recently, Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), which has since changed its ways to also book sales in Britain, Germany, Spain and Italy, has been asked to pay Luxembourg $295 million in back taxes. It has also taken Ireland to the European Court of Justice for failing to recover up to 13 billion euros of tax due from Apple for the past year. Ireland has said that the action was regrettable. It has taken the stand that while making Apple pay the amount was unjustified, it had taken all necessary follow-up action with both Apple and the EU. TickerPrice Change Last WeekPrice Change Last 6 MonthsAAPL+0.77%+8.10%FB+0.80%+22.00%GOOGL+2.04%+17.57%MSFT+2.02%+15.61%INTC+4.07%+9.99%CSCO+0.36%+2.02%AMZN+2.94%+10.16% Other storiesCorporateBain Intends to Make Peace with WDC: After winning the bidding war to acquire Toshiba’s memory chip business, U.S. investor Bain Capital has indicated that it will try to settle things with Western Digital (WDC  -  Free Report) at the earliest. However, the acquisition will close by the March deadline even without the settlement and the investment firm has already reached out for government approval in China and elsewhere.Western Digital, for its part, continues to say it will challenge the acquisition through arbitration, but some now believe it’s on the back foot given that Toshiba actually owns the operations and technology and now has the right to block WDC out of its new Fab 6, impacting its ability to procure NAND.WDC appears to have really messed up the negotiations, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg. So now, it may be in the uncomfortable position of having to share technology with competitors Hynix and Seagate. All of a sudden, its multi-billion dollar SanDisk deal looks wasted.And Seagate, which appeared to have fallen behind in the NAND race, now looks more favorably positioned to cut a supply deal with Toshiba Memory (Pangea). Bain is looking to cash out in three years by floating shares in Pangea and WDC may get in on them. But that still won’t solve its supply problem.Canaccord Upgrades Microsoft: Canaccord analysts Richard Davis and David Hynes are optimistic about Microsoft’s gaming prowess and think that the soon-to-be-launched Xbox One X and eSports prospects are enough to warrant a ratings upgrade from Hold to Buy. The analysts believe that Microsoft has the gaming depth to run its own leagues perhaps growing into a Ticketmaster equivalent of eSports.It’s true that eSports is catching on in a big way, particularly in North America, and Microsoft does have a better chance than many to build its position. But that isn’t the only place it’s likely to gain from: 1) Office Productivity (2) Gaming (3) Marketing, and (4) Azure’s Platform as a Service have been developed under CEO Satya Nadella to generate a period of sustained and accelerating growth, the analysts say.Legal/RegulatoryApple-Qualcomm Dispute in Light of New EU Rules: Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report), which charges licensing rates for its standards essential patents on the ""fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory"" (FRAND) licensing model, has been in the midst of patent licensing issues for the last few years. It started in Asia (China, South Korea) and has now spread to the U.S. with Apple playing a key role.The truth is that what was once considered fair and reasonable is now being contested because companies like Apple simply don’t want to pay up. There’s logic in their argument, too. The FRAND is a very low fixed rate that a company charges when its technology becomes part of a standard that all device makers are compelled to use.But because of the growing number of devices, and the varying value of devices, the fixed rate is actually more lucrative when incorporated in a higher-value device than a lower-value one, such as an iPhone versus a cheap Android. Apple’s argument (and that of other device makers) is that companies like Qualcomm, aren’t contributing to the additional value, so they shouldn’t be allowed to claim a share of it.However, this argument overlooks Qualcomm’s viewpoint (and those of other such patent holders like Nokia and Ericsson) that this was what made it possible to charge a low rate in the first place. Raising the rate based on individual negotiations would mean more limited adoption of new technologies, which would be bad for consumers.  The issue gets more interesting because the EU is drawing up new rules fixing the reasonable rate for patent holders given the increasing number of new devices that nowadays also includes IoT (Apple’s Watch for instance uses a Qualcomm technology that finally allows it to be untethered from the iPhone). Naturally, device makers like Apple, Samsung, Huawei and others will be opposing the EU’s decision.Google Moves on Russia:  Following a report from the Director of National Intelligence about Russia Today (RT) being one of the publications close to the Russian government and systematically undermining American trust in the democratic system prevalent in the country, Google took some action.The world’s leading search engine and owner of YouTube, removed RT from its Google Preferred bundle. Advertisers usually pay a premium for ad placements in the Premium section because it comprises what’s most popular on YouTube. In that respect, RT was reportedly the second most popular channel. The company is currently carrying on internal investigations. Note that other state-backed channels like Al-Jazeera and the BBC remain as part of its premium inventory.New Products/TechnologyTrueDepth is Apple iPhone X Differentiator: Famed Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo says that Apple’s Face ID facial identification system, places it up to 2.5 years ahead of its Android peers. Face ID, as the name implies, is a facial recognition system that scans a user’s face in 3D to determine whether the phone should be turned on. It harnesses Apple’s TrueDepth technology sitting inside the camera.Kuo estimates that Apple will sell 30 million to 35 million of the devices over the next year.Separately, RBC Capital Markets, surveyed more than 4,000 people interested in buying an iPhone, finding that 28% were looking for the iPhone X, 17% the iPhone 8, 20% iPhone 8 Plus and the rest older iPhones. This is a slightly smaller percentage than last year but still quite high. It’s also encouraging that the demand for the iPhone 8 series appears higher than iPhone X given the production glitches the company is seeing with the new Face ID camera feature.Some Issues with iPhone 8: A customer each in China, Japan and Taiwan said they received iPhones with the casing cracked open. It’s believed that the problem was caused by a bloated battery although there was no evidence of scorching or an explosion. Apple is looking into the matter but further details aren’t available yet.On the other hand, since Apple has saved most new features for its X phones, iPhone 8 availability has been much better than its previous iteration. Analyst and venture capitalist Gene Munster says that proprietary checks of 190 different Apple stores across the U.S. show that 61% of iPhone 8 SKUs are in stock compared with 20% last year and 50% the year before.Microsoft Bids Adieu to Groove Music: Microsoft’s streaming music service, originally called Zune, then renamed to Xbox Music and finally Groove Music is now being shut down. The company is making available software that will allow users to migrate their play lists and bought music over to rival Spotify but will maintain the app as a music player and part of Windows 10. From Dec 31, users will no longer be able to stream, share or buy new music through the app but will receive refunds for amounts left in their subscriptions or a Microsoft Store gift card for 120% the prorated amount.Amazon Delivery Service: Amazon is increasingly handling greater portions of the goods it sells on its platform. Now, to increase the efficiency of deliveries during the holiday season, the company is bringing Seller Flex, an idea it has used successfully in India for the last two years. Seller Flex basically allows the seller to use own or rented warehouses closer to its area of operations with Amazon overseeing deliveries.This of course eliminates a major function of FedEx and UPS, which had been taking care of these aspects earlier. It doesn’t however mean that Amazon will not use the couriers for the actual deliveries, just that it will now determine the packaging, best route, etc for these goods. This can potentially increase delivery efficiencies, offer free two-day delivery to more people and reduce load on Amazon’s own warehouses.On the other hand, logistics is a booming market. The ecommerce side in particular is estimated to grow 15.7% between 2016 and 2020 while the overall market will grow just 6.0%, according to market researcher Armstrong & Associates. So Amazon grabbing a larger share of this business means additional profits for the company.  Collaborations and M&AWal-Mart Acquires Parcel: In the escalating ecommerce battle between Amazon and Wal-Mart, the company that is still a distant second is making a large number of acquisitions. The latest one is New York-based last-mile delivery startup Parcel, which distributes meal kits, fresh and frozen grocery and ecommerce items 24/7, the same-day, overnight and in scheduled two-hour windows.Wal-Mart, which didn’t say how much it paid for the company, will use the service in New York City for general merchandise and fresh and frozen groceries from Walmart and Jet. Walmart needs to work on all aspects of the ecommerce game, as it is reportedly one of the biggest losers from Amazon’s Whole Foods acquisition. Research firm Thasos Group says that 24% of new Whole Foods customers after the acquisition were earlier Walmart loyals.Alibaba Gets into College Sports: Alibaba has expanded its relationship with Pac-12, a group of 12 leading American colleges, to engage with global counterparts and student athletes in an academic and cultural exchange. Accordingly, Alibaba will now distribute 175 live Pac-12 Networks events annually across China through its linear and digital channels, thus helping them build their brands. The agreement runs through 2024.Some NumbersNetflix Price Hike: The Netflix price hike is now in progress. For new users, the lowest-tier remains same at $7.99 with the most popular standard tier going from $9.99 to $10.99 and the premium tier going from $11.99 to $13.99. Existing subscribers will be notified from Oct 19 with the change going into effect from their next billing cycles.Netflix has been building and improving the quality of its offerings, so it is not expected to see a major fallout from this price hike. It has also earmarked another $7 billion for additional content including its originals. RBC analysts (as reported by Business Insider) therefore expect the price hike to fetch additional revenues of $650 million in 2018.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

2479,QCOM,"Leading wireless chipset manufacturer, Qualcomm Inc (QCOM  -  Free Report) has recently been fined around $23.4 billion Taiwan dollars (approximately U.S. $773 million) by the Taiwan Fair Trade Commission (""TFTC"") on grounds of anti-trust violations of its chip technology. Qualcomm is being accused for the prices charged for its mobile phone chips and patents, which are in violation of Taiwanese competition law. Notably, Taiwanese companies purchased $30 billion worth of Qualcomm baseband chips.Currently, Qualcomm is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.As per TFTC’s investigation, Qualcomm has been violating antitrust rules for at least seven years and has collected roughly $400 billion Taiwan dollars (U.S. $13 billion) in licensing fees from local companies during that time.Moreover, TFTC has drawn attention towards Qualcomm misusing its monopoly market status over key mobile phone standards. The chipset manufacturer has been accused of not providing products to clients who do not agree with the company’s conditions.Meanwhile, Qualcomm has also drawn scrutiny from regulators around the world. Regulators in South Korea, China, Japan, the European Union and elsewhere are investigating the company’s practices.However, Qualcomm disagrees with TFTC’s decision. The company aims to appeal to the Taiwanese courts after receiving TFTC’s formal decision, which is expected in the next few weeks. The fine bears no relationship to Qualcomm’s revenues or activities in Taiwan. The company will appeal the amount of the fine and the method used to calculate it.The decision by the Taiwanese regulator is the latest challenge to Qualcomm’s business model, which involves selling chips and licensing a suite of patents related to their utilization. While the regulatory and legal attacks differ to some extent, Qualcomm has been commonly alleged due to its monopolistic strategies in the chipset market.The company continues to receive charges for unfair business practices and licensing royalty payments.In December 2016, South Korea's regulatory authority for economic competition, Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC), imposed an administrative fine of approximately 1.03 trillion South Korean Won (approximately U.S. $865 million) on Qualcomm due to unfair business practices.In May 2017, Qualcomm settled a licensing dispute with BlackBerry Limited  by paying $940 million.Meanwhile, the ongoing $1-billion lawsuit dispute with tech giant Apple Inc (AAPL  -  Free Report) continues to get bitter, which is badly affecting the company’s margins.European regulators have also expressed antitrust concerns over Qualcomm’s bid to buy NXP Semiconductors N.V. (NXPI  -  Free Report).The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is also suing Qualcomm over its licensing practices.We expect Qualcomm to quickly resolve all such disputes and focus on its growth strategies. Moreover, aggressive competition in the mobile phone chipset market remain headwinds for the company. The company faces severe competitive threats from its closest rival, Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report), which has been redesigning chipsets for the mobile computing market. We wait to see if this hurts Qualcomm’s sales in the fiscal second quarter.Price PerformanceOver the past month, shares of Qualcomm have returned 6.1% compared with the industry’s gain of 3.3%. Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

2480,QCOM,"In the U.S. wireless industry, Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report), Ericsson (ERIC  -  Free Report) and Qualcomm Inc.’s (QCOM  -  Free Report) subsidiary, Qualcomm Technologies, have recently set their benchmark achievement by attaining a download speed of 1.07 Gbps (gigabits per second). The trio claims to be the first in the industry to have surpassed the Gigabit speed barrier of 1Gbps on 4G LTE.The 1.07 Gbps speed was achieved in a trial in an Ericsson laboratory using Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X20 LTE modem (which supports Category 18 LTE speeds), along with commercial silicon and network infrastructure. These speeds are part of the companies’ ongoing evolution of LTE technology.This achievement builds on the recent announcement by the consortium in reaching 953 Mbps (mega bit per second) in a joint commercial network deployment, with support for Licensed Assisted Access (LAA) technology.Further, the 1.07 Gbps speed was achieved using only three 20MHz carriers of FDD (Frequency Division Duplex using separate transmit and receive frequencies) spectrum, achieving new levels of spectral efficiency for commercial networks and devices. These efficiencies will enable the delivery of the Gigabit class experience to more customers and lead to new wireless innovations.Additionally, licensed band combinations with 12 LTE streams with tri-cell carrier aggregation of FDD spectrum, 4x4 MIMO (multiple in, multiple out) per carrier and 256 QAM modulation of each carrier (radio) signal was also used in the lab trial.On a similar note, in Jan 2017, Ericsson and Qualcomm had joined with AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report) to test the initial 3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project) 5G New Radio (NR) specification, using 28GHz and 39GHz spectrum bands, Qualcomm’s prototype devices and Ericsson providing base station solutions.Industry leadershipVerizon was the first national wireless provider to introduce 4G LTE speeds in 2010, spurring an ecosystem of video viewing and data sharing at a pace not realized before. Since that time, Verizon and its partners have continued to evolve the 4G LTE network, enabling it to carry more robust applications and solutions for consumers, enterprise customers and government agencies.Verizon continues to drive innovation for customers by deploying the most advanced technologies to in the real world environment. Qualcomm Technologies has been at the forefront of driving Gigabit LTE in the industry.Ericsson is working to improve end-user experience and to develop new functionalities and advancements with greater spectral efficiency on LTE. Achieving 1.07 Gbps with Verizon and Qualcomm Technologies on a commercial chipset is a big milestone on the road to 5G.Winding UpA combination of the latest 4G LTE wireless technologies is required to reach these industry-leading speeds. Carrier aggregation, a key technological advancement, bands and multiple spectrum channels allow data to flow more efficiently, resulting in dramatically faster peak speeds.These technologies produce record speeds for wireless technology and pave the way to commercialization with such strong partnerships.Moreover, Gigabit LTE is gaining momentum globally and in the United States.

2481,QCOM,"Qualcomm Inc (QCOM  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 numbers on Nov 1, after the closing bell.In the last four quarters, the company’s earnings were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two, while surpassing the same in the remaining two quarters, with an average beat of 6.49%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayThe company, one of the largest manufacturer of wireless chipset based on baseband technology, has been facing regulatory proceedings of late. The company continues to face charges due to unfair business practices and licensing royalty payments. Qualcomm settled a licensing dispute with BlackBerry Limited (BBRY) by paying $940 million. Meanwhile, the ongoing $1-billion lawsuit dispute with tech giant Apple Inc (AAPL  -  Free Report) is getting bitter, which is affecting the company’s margins.Aggressive competition in the mobile phone chipset market has been affecting Qualcomm’s profits. The company faces competitive threats from its closest rival, Intel Corporation. Intel has been redesigning its chipsets for the mobile computing market. It is to be seen whether such factors dent Qualcomm’s sales in the fourth quarter.On the flip side, Qualcomm’s updated Snapdragon processors and applications look impressive and will aid the company to retain leadership in the global wireless baseband chipset market. Qualcomm is teaming with Verizon Communications Inc (VZ  -  Free Report) and Novatel Wireless for 5G NR mmWave technology trial. This marks Qualcomm’s leadership in 5G, chipset market and mobile connectivity. Qualcomm is extending cash tender offer for its pending NXP Semiconductor deal.Moreover, the company’s foray into areas like automotive, networking and mobile computing are favorable for growth prospects. We expect such strategic business moves to improve Qualcomm's chipset sales in the to-be-reported quarter.We are hopeful about the company’s prospects in the to-be-reported quarter based on certain non-financial metrics of the company, per the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Total number of chipset-enabled devices to be sold in the fourth-quarter 2017 is around 56 million. Qualcomm is estimated to ship approximately 216 million CDMA-based MSM (Mobile Station Modem) chipsets in the quarter under review as against 187 million reported in the previous quarter.We are also impressed with the company’s efforts to offer a quarterly cash dividend of 57 cents per common share, payable on Dec 15, to stockholders of record at the closure of business on Nov 29.On the back of such positives, shares of Qualcomm have returned 2.6% as against the industry’s decline of 2.8%. Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Qualcomm is likely to beat earnings this quarter.

2483,QCOM,"U.S. mobile chipset giant, Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM  -  Free Report) recently announced that Qualcomm River Holdings B.V., an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Qualcomm, has extended the offering period of its previously announced cash tender offer of purchasing all the outstanding common shares of NXP Semiconductors N.V. (NXPI  -  Free Report). The tender offer is now scheduled to expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on Oct. 20, 2017.Qualcomm’s proposed acquisition of Netherlands-based mobile chipset giant NXP Semiconductors is facing a few problems. On Oct 27, 2016, the company entered into a definitive agreement with NXP to buy the latter. Per the deal, Qualcomm would bel paying $110 per NXP share in cash reflecting an enterprise value of approximately $47 billion (equity value of $39 billion) for the Dutch chipset maker. The deal is likely to be closed by the end of 2017 subject to all necessary regulatory approvals.Meanwhile, hedge fund Elliott Management Corp. and two other large shareholders of NXP have approached the company to renegotiate the terms of the deal, which they consider grossly undervalued. In August 2017, Elliot Management disclosed that it had accumulated shares and derivatives amounting to a 6% stake in NXP Semiconductor. Majority of the company’s shareholders are now reluctant to tender their shares at the rate specified by Qualcomm.Consequently, NXP’s outstanding shares tendered have declined from 17.2% in March 2017 to just 3.2% in September. Notably, at least 70% of NXP’s total outstanding shares must be tendered to Qualcomm for the deal to go through. Hence, the deal looks quite unlikely unless Qualcomm adds some sweeteners.Meanwhile, in June 2017, the telecom regulatory body of the European Union, the European Commission (EC), launched a thorough investigation into the proposed acquisition. The EC will probe in depth to see if the deal will lead to higher prices, exclusion of rival chipset suppliers and reduced innovation in the semiconductor industry.The merged entity is likely to command strong market positions with an extensive portfolio of baseband chipsets and chips for near-field communications. The EC has a time limit of 90 working days, till Oct 17, 2017, to take a decision. Notably, the proposed merger has already been approved by the U.S. antitrust authorities.NXP Semiconductors is the largest manufacturer of high-performance, mixed-signal mobile chipsets with 14% market share. The company has a strong clientele serving more than 25,000 customers through its direct sales channel and global network of distribution channel partners. The combined entity is expected to generate annual revenues of more than $30 billion. Further, it is likely to position itself as a strong player in the next-generation mobile chipset segment with a potential market size of $138 billion by 2020.Qualcomm expects the transaction to be significantly accretive to its non-GAAP EPS immediately upon completion. Further, the company expects to generate $500 million of annualized run-rate cost synergies within two years after the transaction closes.Advantages to QualcommThe major positive of the deal is that it will enable Qualcomm to diversify its business model. The company is a leader in the mobile chipset market. However, in recent years, markets for smartphones and tablets have gradually slowed down. Moreover, these chipset businesses are low-margin in nature. For the last couple of years, the company’s business has remained stagnant.On the other hand, NXP manufactures chips for next-generation automotive, industrial and Internet of Things (IoT) segments. Therefore, acquisition of NXP will help Qualcomm in diversifying into highly lucrative end markets such as auto, secured devices, connectivity and secure payments. These segments offer high-margin businesses with strong potential for future growth.The transaction will place Qualcomm in the second position after Intel Corp. (INTC  -  Free Report) in terms of sales in the broader global semiconductor market. Moreover, the combined entity will also become a formidable challenger to other large semiconductor firms like Broadcom Ltd. (AVGO  -  Free Report), Analog Devices Inc. (ADI  -  Free Report) and ARM Holdings.4 Stocks to Watch after the Massive Equifax HackCybersecurity stocks spiked on recent news of a data breach affecting 143 million Americans.

It includes 6-core Core i5 and 4-core Core i3 desktop processors as well as Core i7-8700K. This is reportedly Intel’s best desktop processor with a 4.7 GHz maximum single-core turbo frequency and is touted as an apt processor for single and multithread based applications.Notably, supported by Intel ""Z370"" chipset-based motherboards, the new chipsets are capable of editing 4K 360-degree videos at a 32% faster speed compared with the prior edition. Moreover, the addition of unlocked ""K"" processors that deliver high level of tuning flexibility has made the new launch even more lucrative.PC Gaming Market Growth to Boost Chip SalesIn a recent article, PC Gamer quoted Gartner, which predicted that sale of gaming PCs will increase from 6 million units in 2016 to 8.7 million units in 2020. These will contribute to around 13% of the entire PC shipment revenues.Moreover, per Jon Peddie Research, the PC gaming industry is anticipated to witness CAGR of 6% through 2019. The optimistic projections driven by strong demand for gaming PCs bode well for Intel’s next-generation desktop processors.The launch of game-focused processors comes at an opportune time for the chipmaker. Intel is facing stiff competition from a resurgent Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD  -  Free Report) and NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) in most of its operating segments including PCs. In the mobile segment, the company has failed miserably against Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM  -  Free Report).Recently, Digitimes reported that Intel has delayed the release of some of its next-generation Cannon Lake-based processors, mostly the ones with an integrated GPU, to the end of 2018. These processors reportedly ensure 25% improvement in performance and consume 45% less power compared with the existing 14 nm Kaby Lake processors.We believe that the delay in Cannon Lake release will hurt notebook sales in the near term. Some Intel partners are speculated to skip Canon Lake for the next-generation Ice Lake CPUs. This may hurt the company’s top line as PC sales continue to remain sluggish per the data available from Gartner.4 Stocks to Watch after the Massive Equifax Hack Cybersecurity stocks spiked on recent news of a data breach affecting 143 million Americans.

2485,QCOM,"BlackBerry Limited  is slated to release second-quarter fiscal 2018 (ended Aug 31, 2018) results on Sep 28, before the market opens.In the last quarter, the company reported earnings of 2 cents per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at breakeven. In fact, it has an impressive earnings history.Factors Likely at PlayThe company is expected to perform impressively in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, driven by its decision to end all internal hardware development and focus exclusively on software business.The company expects its software business to either outperform or at least perform at par with the overall market in fiscal 2018. In fact, the company anticipates profitability (on an adjusted basis) and also expects to generate positive free cash flow in the same year.Results in the quarter are likely to be benefitted by payments following the dispute settlement with the U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report). Moreover, BlackBerry’s efforts to expand its product portfolio augur well and should boost results in the quarter.In June 2017 , BlackBerry unveiled an innovative software – QNX Hypervisor 2.0 – for running complex computer systems on Internet-connected cars. The software will help in running complex computer systems in vehicles to make it more secure from hacking.In August 2017, BlackBerry signed an agreement with Appdome, the first cloud hub for mobile app integration. The contract would allow codeless integration of secure voice, video and messaging functions. The deal with Ford (F  -  Free Report), inked last year, aims to send some of its software developers to the car giant to help work on driverless car technology.However, with increasing global exposure, BlackBerry faces the risk of adverse foreign exchange fluctuations. Adverse foreign currency movements might hurt results in the quarter.BlackBerry Limited Price and EPS Surprise BlackBerry Limited Price and EPS Surprise | BlackBerry Limited QuoteA Well-Performing StockInterDigital, Inc.

2486,QCOM,"T-Mobile US Inc. (TMUS  -  Free Report), the third-largest national wireless operator, is planning to bolster its Internet of Things (IoT) suite. The company boasts of being the first wireless provider in North America to conduct successful tests of Narrowband IoT (NB-IoT) technology live on its commercial network.The field tests were conducted in partnership with Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM  -  Free Report) and Ericsson (ERIC  -  Free Report) across multiple sites on T-Mobile’s live commercial LTE (Long-Term Evolution) network in Las Vegas using 200 KHz of T-Mobile’s AWS spectrum.NB-IoT is an evolution of LTE technology based on industry standards and uses small amounts of dedicated spectrum to carry data with efficiency. With its ability to scale and support a direct pathway to 5G, NB-IoT is witnessing rapid adoption across the globe relative to other technologies.T-Mobile US teamed up with the City of Las Vegas to deploy IoT technology throughout the city, including NB-IoT, and will be working on several similar projects. These projects include flood abatement and storm drain monitoring, smart city lighting and environmental monitoring of temperature, humidity, and gas under the city’s Innovation District.City officials are looking forward to work with T-Mobile US to better leverage the growth opportunities from this partnership in order to better serve citizens and tourists.Moreover, T-Mobile US customers can easily get NB-IoT technology to power their connected devices. The company helps customers instantly bring devices to market through all-in-one, low-cost IoT Access packs on certified Cat-1 modules.The IoT Battleground The IoT market is the latest in the line of service and business models and is rapidly gaining market traction. Using IoT to gather data points enable businesses to operate effectively and efficiently, thereby boosting their bottom line. Moreover, IoT hardware and software being cheap are good investment options for. IoT enables any physical electronic device with a valid IP-address to transfer data seamlessly over a wireless network.We believe that this led to generous IoT investments in the last few months.According to a recent report by market intelligence firm, International Data Corporation (IDC), total expenditure on hardware, software, services and connectivity to support IoT is expected to increase 16.7% year over year in 2017 globally, making this an $800-billion market. By 2021, IDC predicts global IoT spending to be almost $1.4 trillion.U.S. telecom behemoths, Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report) and AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report) have been continuously focusing on solidifying their foothold in the IoT space through various deals with different companies.To this end, in Mar 2017, Verizon launched the first nationwide commercial 4G LTE Category M1 network to offer IoT services across its entire LTE network. However, Verizon is also pursuing NB-IoT more cautiously with plans to launch the technology in the near future.AT&T recently launched its LTE-M (LTE for M2M) IoT network and has plans to cover Mexico by the end of the year. LTE-M is an LTE variant that caters to machine-to-machine communications. Moreover, AT&T continues to evaluate NB-IoT technology for its IoT suite but has yet to find a compelling reason to deploy the technology.U.S. national wireless carrier, Sprint Corp. (S  -  Free Report) aims to complete the deployment of LTE Category 1 across its nationwide network by the end of this July. The company has plans to begin deploying LTE Cat M in mid-2018 followed by LTE Cat NB1 (NB-IoT). Both Cat-1 and Cat NB1 are part of the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) standards process.Research firm Gartner predicted that the usage of IoT devices is expected to increase from 8.3 billion connected devices this year to 20.4 billion by 2020 globally, outnumbering laptops, smartphone and tablets. This is because IoT devices do not require a lot of computing power. Instead, IoT collects data at the edge, pooling information to drive analytic insights.From the technology perspective, hardware, especially modules and sensors that connect end points to networks will be the largest IoT spending category for the first few years. The services category will follow suit in later years.Price Performance and Zacks RankDespite such booming prospects, the price performance and Zacks Rank of T-Mobile US is depressing.Over the past three months, share price of T-Mobile US declined 6.21% compared with the Zacks categorized Wireless National industry’s fall of 8.93%.We believe that T-Mobile US’ operation in a highly competitive and saturated wireless market where success depends on technical superiority, quality of services and scalability remain concerns. Moreover, the marketing costs of the low-priced promotional plans (to lure in more users) lead to high cash burn and heavy losses. We believe that such negative aspects have led to the company’s current Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

2487,QCOM,"The top news stories from last week are Microsoft’s (MSFT  -  Free Report) reorganization, and Alphabet’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) Dandelion spinoff and Twitter’s (TWTR  -  Free Report) fake news button.Microsoft ReorganizationOn Thursday, Microsoft sent out an internal memo to employees confirming that it would cut up to 10% of its 50,000-strong global sales force, or up to 5,000 employees. The CNBC reported number of 3,000 is probably more likely since Microsoft usually reassigns some employees to new roles as part of its now-annual employee reductions (it announced 2,850 cuts last July, 7,800 the year before that and 18,000 in Jul 2014).The current reduction is aimed at better aligning its sales force to its targeted markets of Enterprise and Small, Medium & Corporate (SMC).It will now increase focus on Manufacturing, Financial Services, Retail, Health, Education and Government verticals. It will also reorganize the fee structure for enterprises depending on the type of solution desired (modern workplace, business applications, apps & infrastructure, or data & AI). It expects to have focused solutions to address the emerging demand for IoT, AI, voice and mixed reality segments. Microsoft is also working on a strategy to increase sales of support services as a way of increasing overall revenue.It is also centralizing consumer and device sales teams under its Marketing and Consumer Business (MCB) to facilitate the implementation of sales strategies leveraging ecosystem partners.Alphabet Spins Off DandelionLast week, Alphabet spun off its geothermal system company called Dandelion (incubated by its moonshot unit X Labs) with a seed funding of $2 million to start operations and pursue sales (initially only in New York). The funding came from a collaborative fund that included ZhenFund and Borealis Ventures.Geothermal heating/cooling is typically an expensive process, which is why it hasn’t been broadly adopted yet. But Dandelion aims to make it easy and relatively inexpensive for households to use. Its system costs $20,000 to $25,000, significantly lower than the $60,000 current systems reportedly cost. Moreover, it can be bought in installments along with a smart thermostat for no downpayment.Once people sign up for the service, Dandelion’s local installers will get to work digging 1,000 feet deep wells that are a few inches in diameter. Into these will go plastic pipes called ground loops that connect to a pump located inside the house. In winter, water in the pipes absorbs heat from the ground, with the pump dispersing warm air inside the house. In summer, the cooler temperature of the earth is absorbed by the water from which cool air is dispersed inside the house.While clean energy has become a major goal for all companies, it’s important to remember that our homes are also responsible for carbon dioxide emissions. According to the U.S. Green Building Council as reported in the media, buildings are responsible for 39% of these emissions, most of which is attributable to fossil fuels used in heating, cooling and lighting our homes, and to power appliances and electrical equipment.Once Dandelion’s solutions are installed, there would be an immediate reduction in energy bills, which should make the solution attractive for customers.Twitter Considering Fake News ButtonThere is a rumor that Twitter is developing a Fake News button that twitterati can use to flag fake news. This is easier said than done because who’s to judge what is fake news? Just because someone says something is fake doesn’t make it so. Moreover, it can be used with malicious intent to block or harass opposition thus defeating the purpose of social networking in the first place.Investigating each report to confirm the allegation within a reasonable time could be an uncalled-for pressure on resources. At the same time, there is quite an uproar about the concept so social networking companies have got to do something to show people that they remain neutral if nothing else. The unnamed folks spinning this story also say that work on a fake news button is going slow because of the above-mentioned concerns. TickerPrice Change Last WeekPrice Change Last 6 MonthsAAPL+0.72%+21.78%FB+1.67%+29.32%GOOGL+2.29%+17.73%MSFT+1.52%+12.33%INTC-0.27%-7.58%CSCO-1.02%+2.92%AMZN+2.94%+31.60% Other storiesCorporateFirst Apple Retail Store in Taiwan: To further its expansion plans in Asia, Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) launched its first store in Taiwan. The 14,300-sq. foot store, located at Taipei 101 tower, is designed to offer customers access to its “Today At Apple” programs. “Today At Apple” is an in-store educational program launched in May this year to educate customers about music, photography, video, art, design coding etc through 60 free sessions. Apple is reasonably well entrenched in the country with a 15% share of the smartphone market.Tech Companies Want World Cup Streaming Rights: Companies seem to be following in Twitter’s footsteps as they escalate the bidding war for the rights to stream soccer world cup highlights. 21st Century Fox, which has the world cup broadcast rights, had to dish out $400 million for them, so it will surely weigh its options before it decides on a single exclusive deal or distributes to a number of broadcasters. Bloomberg says Fox hasn’t decided yet.Petya Virus Attack: A new ransomware attack has affected some European businesses (advertiser WPP, food company Mondelez, legal firm DLA Piper and Danish shipping and transport firm Maersk) and an electricity supplier, the central bank, the state telecom company and an airport in Ukraine. Initially, the virus encrypted the hard disk and shut down the computer, then asked for a ransom to restore access. But later, the code was reportedly altered to wipe out the disk completely. It has been reported that it is now a targeted attack mostly against the Ukraine.Legal/RegulatoryQualcomm Sues Apple: Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report) has filed a complaint with the International Trade Commission alleging the Apple has infringed on six of its patents including one that speeds up the battery. It is seeking an injunction to stop the import of phones that use alternative technology (i.e. Intel’s) because they infringe on its patents. Qualcomm says these patents aren’t the standard essential patents that the two are currently fighting over and with respect to which Apple has instructed its suppliers to stop paying Qualcomm.Apple said in that case that Qualcomm charges it more than what it usually pays others, so its price was unreasonable under FRAND rules for standard essential patents. Apple didn’t say, however, that Qualcomm charged it a differential rate, i.e. more than it charges others based on the higher priced iPhone. So that case remains unresolved. Qualcomm’s current complaint may be to keep Apple’s lawyers busy, in what is a standard practice in patent infringement lawsuits. Intel-John McAfee Settle: Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) saw a satisfactory close in its lawsuit with John McAfee after he sold the antivirus company in his own name. Intel said that using his own name in companies violated the trademarks he has already sold Intel after which he went to court.The two parties have now agreed that John McAfee will not use his name, trademark his name or the phrase ""John McAfee Privacy Phone,"" or use ""John McAfee Global Technologies"" in connection with cybersecurity- and security-related products and services. He could, however, use his name in advertising, promotions and presentations for other purposes. Intel currently retains a 49% stake in the security company having sold the rest to TPG Capital, which subsequently sold most of its interest to private equity firm Thoma Bravo.ITC Rules in Cisco’s Favor: Cisco (CSCO  -  Free Report) won a temporary reprieve in its ongoing legal battles with Arista. Cisco earlier alleged that Arista had infringed on six of its patents, of which the ITC found that there were in fact two violations. The ITC has the authority to ban import of goods into the U.S., so its ruling directed accordingly.Arista, meanwhile, approached the U.S. Patent Office, and has appealed to the ITC to reconsider its decision on the basis of the Patent Trial and Appeal Board finding Cisco’s claims to be invalid. Arista was formed and is run by former Cisco employees and Cisco has often in the past claimed patent infringements and leakage of technological information.But Arista has always worked itself around the infringement, so it could never be pinned down. The company is now giving Cisco a run for its money as it grabs a growing number of cloud customers.Google, NHS Violated UK Law: The Information Commissioner’s Office has said that the National Health Service-conducted trial with Google’s DeepMind for a new app exposed 1.6 million patient’s records to the technology company without the patients’ consent, thus violating their privacy. DeepMind used patient data going back up to five years to design software called Streams.The software uses blood test results to determine when a patient is at risk of kidney disease to push an alert to medical staff using the app. NHS shared the data under a legal basis called ""direct care,"" which allows data to be shared in order to improve patient treatment. This clause also doesn’t require explicit consent of patients. However, the investigating authority found inconsistencies in the procedure and therefore found the parties guilty.New Products/TechnologyApple Face-Scanning Technology: Apple is reportedly testing face-scanning technology to unlock smartphones instead of the Touch ID fingerprint testing it uses currently. It was earlier rumored that the next iPhones would come equipped with 3D sensors, possibly to enable segmented reality experiences. It’s now being speculated that the 3D sensors will also scan and recognize the face to unlock the phone in a few 100 milliseconds. It will also be able to authenticate payments and launch other apps where security information is required.Apple Considering News App Change: Apple is reportedly planning to tweak its popular news app, which had 40 million users as of Oct 2016. The news app is a news aggregator that allows iOS users to access all their media content in a single place. According to AdAge, this has been a good thing for Apple but not so much for its publishing partners, meaning that they aren’t seeing the dollars that would keep them on the platform.Apple is apparently making two changes to rectify the situation. The first is a payment system that would allow paywalled websites to charge a few cents to access a page. The second is allowing the publisher to use its own advertising tools including Google’s DoubleClick. This would mean that publishers could earn from Apple News just as well as they do on their own sites. It isn’t clear yet if the change will roll out with iOS11 this year, but that would seem to be a reasonable expectation.  Facebook’s “Find Wi-Fi” Feature: Facebook now has a tab called Find Wi-Fi that once enabled, allows a user to locate nearby coffee shops, malls and other businesses that have Wi-Fi hotspots. The goal is of course to keep people using the app longer, especially in remote areas and places with inconsistent connectivity although it serves the dual purpose of locating nearby places that were earlier found through Google Maps. The feature is rolling out globally and is already available in some countries but it will become more useful only after more businesses opt into the program.Amazon Patent for Adjustable Fashion Mannequin: Amazon has patented a design for an adjustable fashion mannequin that uses electric motors, hydraulic systems or magnets to change hip, waist or chest size as required. It also has a camera that can efficiently take a picture once a garment has been fitted on the mannequin.Amazon says that testing showed that it takes about four hours to fit and photograph a mannequin in different sizes of a single garment. But using the adjustable mannequin, it was possible for a single person to take 3,000 to 4,000 photographs a year, thus significantly reducing the required time and money. The patent is expected to facilitate Amazon Fashion sales as it races to push traditional retailers out of the space.M&A and CollaborationsApple May Invest in LG Display: The Korea Herald and MacRumors say that Apple is getting ready to put $1.75 billion to $2.62 billion into LG’s dedicated OLED facility. Samsung is currently Apple’s OLED supplier from which the company has already ordered 70 million units for the next iteration of its flagship iPhone (the first version using OLED). Second sourcing would definitely be a good idea, especially since the Samsung also competes with Apple in the very smartphones that will consume the OLED screens.Google Accelerator Program in Brazil: Google has picked Contratado.me, which focuses on recruitment of up-and-coming skills in areas such as business intelligence; Guichê Virtual, which offers a bus ticketing app; Contabilizei, which offers online accounting resources and Arquivei, a venture providing archiving management service for tax documentation for its accelerator program covering 33 startups from 16 countries.After a two-week ""intensive"" mentoring period at Google's offices in Mountain View there will be six months of technical support and training. The startups also qualify for up to $50,000 in equity-free financing and $100,000 worth of credits to buy Google products.Alibaba Invests in Bike-Sharing Startup Ofo: Following Ant Financial’s small investment in Chinese bike sharing startup Ofo earlier this year, Alibaba itself has led a funding round that raised over $700 million. Other investors in this round included Hony Capital and CITIC Private Equity as well as existing financers Didi and DST Global. The bike sharing market in China is heating up with the two companies at the forefront being Ofo and Tencent-backed Beijing Mobike Technology.Both these companies claim over 100 million users but while Ofo says it’s reached 150 cities across 5 countries, Mobike says it’s reached 100 cities.  Both are targeting 200 cities in the near future across all continents. Users can scan the QR code to avail a ride and leave the bike where they reach their destination. The GPS chip in the bike signals its availability to the next user.  NVIDIA Partners with BAIDU: The companies are partnering on four emerging opportunities involving artificial intelligence: self-driving cars using NVIDIA DrivePX, AI-powered personal assistants from Baidu in NVIDIA Shield TVs, NVIDIA’s GPU accelerators in Baidu’s cloud, and NVIDIA’s GPU technology in Baidu’s AI framework Paddle Paddle.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone! It could become the mother of all technological revolutions. Apple sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years, creating a $1.7 trillion market.Zacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this fast-emerging phenomenon and 6 tickers for taking advantage of it.

2488,QCOM,"The Dow ended its record run of wins to suffer a dramatic decline near the end of the week. Stellar earnings performances helped the index register its 35th record close for 2017 on Monday. But by Tuesday, the tide had turned with the index closing in the red after Trump sounded off a strong warning to errant North Korea. Such saber rattling ultimately led to significant losses for the blue-chip index as well as broader markets on Thursday.Last Week’s PerformanceThe blue-chip index registered its 34th record for 2017 to finish above the 22,000 threshold yet again last Friday. The index gained 0.3%, ending in the green for the ninth straight trading day. This is highest number of gains recorded since February. The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. GS contributed the most gains toward the index’s stellar performance during this session.Such gains were primarily attributable to an astounding number of job additions in the month of July. A total of 209,000 new jobs were created within the United States. In the past two months alone, there a total of 450,000 new jobs have been added to the economy.The index gained 1.2% last week, marking its second straight weekly increase. The Dow has finished in positive territory now for four out of the five past weeks. The Dow surpassed the 22,000 milestone riding high on performances from JP Morgan (JPM  -  Free Report), 3M (MMM  -  Free Report) and Goldman Sachs. Also, The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) has added 300 points to the blue chip index since February, helping it to cross the psychological milestone.The Dow This WeekThe index increased 0.1% on Monday to register its 35th record close for 2017, ending above the psychological 22,000 mark yet again. The index also increased for the tenth straight trading day, the highest since February. The blue-chip index rose 2.8% since February, with Boeing and Goldman Sachs contributing to the majority of the gains.The index lost 0.2% on Tuesday, ending its 35-session record run of wins for the year on Tuesday, tumbling after Trump sounded off a fresh warning to North Korea. President Trump announced that North Korea would be dealt with “fire and fury like the world has never seen”, if the rogue country continues to threaten the U.S. The blue-chip index was led lower primarily by a drop in shares of Merck (MRK  -  Free Report), DuPont  and Nike NKE.The index declined by 0.2% on Wednesday, briefly slipping below the 22,000 milestone but pared losses to finish above the psychological level. Decline in the Dow was primarily due to losses made by shares of The Walt Disney Company (DIS  -  Free Report) after the media behemoth announced plans to end its distribution deal with Netflix, Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report).The index lost 0.9% on Thursday even as all benchmarks endured their most dismal trading day since the middle of May. This the third successive session when all three benchmarks have suffered losses and marks the first such reverse since the middle of April.Broader markets were weighed down by heightened tensions between the U.S. and North Korea. The Dow was weighed down primarily by Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) and Goldman Sachs, which lost 3.2% and 2.4%, respectively. Only three of the 30 Dow components managed to close the day with gains.Components Moving the Index Disney posted better-than-expected earnings for the third straight quarter, as it reported third-quarter fiscal 2017 results. The company’s earnings in the reported quarter came in at $1.58 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.53 but decreased 2.5% year over year. Meanwhile, revenues came in at $14,238 million, almost flat year over year but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $14,442 million.Concurrently, Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rated Disney stated that it will terminate distribution agreement with Netflix for subscription streaming of the new movies starting in 2019. Instead, the company will have its own streaming services – one for Disney and Pixar brands and another for ESPN followers.  (Read: Disney Q3 Earnings Top, Unveils Streaming Services)Boeing has finalized an order for delivering 12 737 MAX airplanes to Air Lease Corporation (AL). Although details of the contract have been revealed recently, the order was announced during the Paris Air Show. The deal comprises order for five 737 MAX 7s and seven 737 MAX 8s. It also includes two new orders for the 787-9 Dreamliner. (Read: Boeing Secures 12 737 MAX Jets Order from Air Lease)Additionally, Zacks Rank #3 rated Boeing has clinched a contract for Next Generation Thermal, Power and Controls (NGT-PAC) program.

(Read: Boeing Wins $409M Air Force Deal for NGT-PAC Program)Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO  -  Free Report) won a temporary victory in a long-running patent infringement case at International Trade Commission (ITC) against its close rival Arista Networks (ANET  -  Free Report).Notably, Zacks Rank #3 rated Cisco filed the complaint (“945 investigation”) with ITC in late 2014 alleging Arista of infringing six patents. On May 5, 2017, ITC issued a “limited exclusion order” and “cease and desist” order after it found that Arista’s Ethernet switching products violated two patents (“577” and “668”).As per a recent 8K filing by Arista – following disapproval by the United States Trade Representative of ITC’s Final Determination in the case – it is now barred from importing and selling the aforesaid Ethernet switching products in the U.S.However, the victory may be short-lived for Cisco. According to the 8K filing, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) has issued final written decisions invalidating all claims related to the above mentioned patents, which Arista was found infringing by ITC. (Read: Cisco Wins Temporary Victory, Arista Products Faces ITC Ban)Intel Corporation INTC has become the latest tech company to announce plans to build self-driving cars as it tries to stay ahead of competition from Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report) and Nvidia NVDA. Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rated Intel plans to build 100 cars to test its self-driving technology. The cars will be “level 4” vehicles, which mean they will be able to handle most driving situations themselves. They will be tested in the U.S., Israel, and Europe.These new cars will include technology from the Israeli tech company Mobileye (MBLY), which is the world’s largest supplier of systems used in automotive collision detection systems. As of Aug 8, Intel has officially completed its acquisition of 84% of Mobileye for $15.3 billion. (Read: Intel Announces Plan to Build Self-Driving Cars)DuPont and Dow Chemical  said that they have received all required regulatory approvals and clearances for their planned mega-merger. The companies expect their ‘merger of equals’ to complete after the market closes on Aug 31.Shares of both the companies will cease trading at the close of the NYSE on Aug 31. Moreover, shares of the new combined entity, “DowDuPont” will start trading on the NYSE under the ticker symbol ""DWDP"" on Sep 1.Following the completion of the merger, the combined entity would eventually break up into three independent companies through tax-free spin-offs.

2489,QCOM,"No significant developments took place in the telecom industry last week despite its major stocks gaining value. However, a few events attracted attention.U.S. telecom behemoth, Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report) is planning to cut costs by up to $10 billion over the next four years. The company wants to fund its dividend with this savings, as stated by the company’s chief executive Lowell McAdam at a Goldman Sachs conference. In a separate development, Verizon has decided to aggressively cooperate with major U.S. cities in order to expand its fiber optics networks to support 4G LTE and upcoming 5G wireless standards as well as wireline connections.Leading cable MSO (multi service operator) and media giant Comcast Corp. (CMCSA  -  Free Report) has shut down its standalone over-the-top (OTT) service – Watchable. The company had launched the service in September 2015. Through this offering, Comcast tried to foray into the highly lucrative digital advertising market. Comcast carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2493,QCOM,"The United States International Trade Commission (ITC) has decided to investigate a complaint filed by chipset manufacturer, Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM  -  Free Report) against tech giant Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) for infringing six of its patents covering various aspects of mobile phone technology, this July. ITC had mentioned about establishing a deadline for finalizing its probe within the next 45 days.As part of this lawsuit, Qualcomm had also requested ITC to investigate Apple's infringing imports and issue a Limited Exclusion Order (LEO) to ban importation of iPhones and other products linked with the patent in the U.S. The Company is seeking the LEO against iPhones that use cellular baseband processors other than those supplied by Qualcomm's affiliates. Additionally, the company is seeking a Cease and Desist Order barring further sales, marketing, advertising, demonstration, warehousing of inventory for distribution and use of imported products in the U.S.Qualcomm boasts that each of its six patents are vital to iPhone functions. These patents provide smartphones with high performance and extended battery life.  While these technologies are central to iPhone’s performance, Apple continues to use Qualcomm's technology without payments.In addition to the ITC complaint, Qualcomm also filed another complaint against Apple in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California demanding damages and injunctive relief.The Story So FarThe companies have been battling over licensing royalty payments since Jan 2017. Apple had slapped a $1 billion lawsuit, accusing Qualcomm of overcharging for chips and refusing to pay $1 billion in promised rebates.This suit was counter attacked by Qualcomm in Apr 2017. The company clearly mentioned the value of its invented technologies, their contribution and share in the industry through its licensing program. The filing also detailed Apple’s illegal and improper handling of agreements and negotiations with device manufacturers, misleading regulators to attack Qualcomm around the world and not utilizing the full performance of Qualcomm's modem chips in its iPhone7.We witnessed Apple reverting with some strong solid backups. Recently, the company has garnered the support of big players from Silicon Valley and suppliers in its nasty legal spat with Qualcomm. Per media reports, the Computer and Communications Industry Association (CCIA) – boasting names like Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL  -  Free Report), Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report), Facebook Inc. (FB), Microsoft Corp., Samsung Electronics, Netflix Inc, Intel Corp. (INTC  -  Free Report) and many more – has filed a petition with the United States International Trade Commission (ITC) to snub Qualcomm's demand of seeking an injunction on iPhone import. Meanwhile, Apple’s suppliers have filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, accusing Qualcomm of “violating” two sections of the Sherman Act, part of the U.S Antitrust Law. They have claimed that Qualcomm continues to extract additional licensing money over assembling of iPhones.With so many twists and turns, we remain eager to see how this dispute actually pans out in the coming days. Moreover, Qualcomm is one such company which has been long grappling with legal disputes, regulatory proceedings and their related charges. We expect Qualcomm to resolve all such disputes and focus on its growth strategies.Zacks Rank and Price PerformanceQualcomm currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.However, the price performance has been disappointing. Over the past three months, share price of Qualcomm lost 3.49%, as against the industry’s 0.78% gain.We believe that tough competition in the mobile phone chipset market, stringent regulatory norms along with anti-competitive and unfair business practices charges resulted in the company’s below-par performance.One Simple Trading IdeaSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

Not to forget the fact that, a pure play value investor always misses the chance of betting on stocks that have bright long-term prospects. On the other hand, a growth investor often ends up investing in expensive stocks.It has been observed that strategic mingling of both growth and value investing principles gives us a mixed investing strategy. Termed as GARP (growth at a reasonable price), this approach is getting popular with each passing day. What GARPers look for is whether the stocks are somewhat undervalued and have solid sustainable growth potential (Investopedia).And here lies the importance of a not-so-popular fundamental metric, the price/earnings growth (PEG) ratio. Although it is categorized under value investing, this strategy follows the principles of both growth and value investing.The PEG ratio is defined as: (Price/ Earnings)/Earnings Growth RateIt relates the stocks P/E ratio with future earnings growth rate.While P/E alone only gives the idea of stocks, which are trading at a discount, PEG while adding the GROWTH element to it, helps to find those stocks that have solid future potential.A lower PEG ratio, preferably less than 1, is always better for GARP investors.Say for example, if a stock’s P/E ratio is 10 and expected long-term growth rate is 15%, the company’s PEG will come down to 0.66, a ratio which indicates both undervaluation and future growth potential.Unfortunately, this ratio is often neglected due to investors’ limitation to calculate the future earnings growth rate of a stock.There are some drawbacks to using the PEG ratio though. It doesn’t consider the very common situation of changing growth rates such as the forecast of the first three years at very high growth rate followed by a sustainable but lower growth rate in the long term.Hence, PEG-based investing can turn out to be even more rewarding if some other relevant parameters are also taken into consideration.Here are the screening criteria for a winning strategy:PEG Ratio less than X Industry MedianP/E Ratio (using F1) less than X Industry Median (For more accurate valuation purpose.)Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) (Whether good market conditions or bad, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1  or #2 have a proven history of success.)Market Capitalization greater than $1 Billion (This helps us to focus on companies that have strong liquidity.)Average 20 Day Volume greater than 50,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Percentage Change F1 Earnings Estimate Revisions (4 Weeks) greater than 5%: Upward estimate revisions add to the optimism, suggesting further bullishness.Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 (Hold) offer the best upside potential. Here are five of the nine stocks that qualified the screening:Trinseo S.A.

2498,QCOM,"The legal dispute between Apple Inc (AAPL  -  Free Report) and Qualcomm Incorporated (QCOM  -  Free Report) is getting nastier by the day.In June, per a filing with the U.S International Trade Commission (USITC), Qualcomm had asked to ban iPhone import from China, accusing Apple of violating six of its patents related to mobile technology. The chipmaker filed another lawsuit against Apple with the U.S. District Court for Southern California, seeking damages for patent violation.Recent developments indicate that USITC is investigating Qualcomm’s claims. As quoted by Reuters, USITC has said that it will target a 45-day deadline to complete the investigation and give its decision at the earliest possible.Apple Inc. Price Apple Inc. Price | Apple Inc. QuoteAs expected, Qualcomm has welcomed this action. It was quoted saying “We look forward to the ITC’s expeditious investigation of Apple’s ongoing infringement of our intellectual property and the accelerated relief that the commission can provide.”Qualcomm has been badly hit due to its conflict with Apple. Fiscal third-quarter 2017 revenues fell 11% year over year as a result of the dispute with Apple and its suppliers. This has resulted in loss of a chunk of licensing fees. Consequently, profits fell nearly 40%. Moreover, Qualcomm slashed its guidance for the current quarter due to the legal spat.Legal Dispute Backdrop                                                                                                             The Apple-Qualcomm dispute started in January this year when the latter was dragged to court by Apple in a $1 billion lawsuit related to licensing royalty payments. In the lawsuit, Apple accused Qualcomm of overcharging for chips and refusing to pay some $1 billion in rebates.In Apr 2017, Qualcomm launched a counterattack on Apple. In a filing, the company elaborated on Apple’s illegal and improper handling of agreements and negotiations with device manufacturers, misleading regulators to attack Qualcomm around the world and not utilizing the full potential of its modem chips in iPhone 7. Apple has started using Intel chips for iPhone 7.In Jun 2017, Apple fired a legal salvo at Qualcomm, accusing the chipmaker of having questionable business practices that help it get more patent money and suppress innovation at the same time.Suppliers and Silicon Valley Back AppleLast month, Apple suppliers – Compal, Hon Hai Precision, Pegatron and Wistron – also pitched in, filing a lawsuit against Qualcomm in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California. They have accused Qualcomm of “violating” two sections of the Sherman Act, part of the U.S Antitrust Law in the suit filed. This was in response to Qualcomm’s lawsuit filed in May this year, in which, the company had accused the four suppliers of holding its royalties/license fees on Apple’s insistence.Also, Apple has garnered the support of Silicon Valley biggies in its fight against the chipmaker. In July, the Computer and Communications Industry Association (CCIA) – boasting names like Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report), Amazon.com Inc, Facebook Inc (FB  -  Free Report), Microsoft Corp, Samsung Electronics, Netflix Inc, Intel Corp and many more –filed a petition with the United States International Trade Commission to snub Qualcomm's demand of seeking an injunction on iPhone import. Per CCIA “Qualcomm is already using its dominant position to pressure competitors and tax competing products. If the ITC were to grant this exclusion order, it would help Qualcomm use its monopoly power for further leverage against Apple, and allow them to drive up prices on consumer devices.”Bach then, it had further added “The ITC has a choice whether to further reward anti-competitive behavior – or to reject this anti-free market, anti-consumer request."" According CCIA, banning iPhone (which uses Intel’s chips) import will result in disruption of supply, which will adversely impact consumers.With so many twists and turns, we remain eager to see how this dispute actually pans out in the coming days.Zacks Rank and Stock Price MovementAt present, Apple carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2499,QCOM,"Shares of BlackBerry  dipped on Monday after Goldman Sachs (GS) resumed its negative coverage of the once-powerful smartphone maker.Goldman analyst Gabriela Borges reiterated her “sell” rating for BlackBerry in a note to clients. The note also projects a 10% downside for BlackBerry to set up a new $8.50 per share price target.BlackBerry’s stock had climbed almost 40% since the start of the year after the company set its sights on software opportunities, which include cyber security.On top of that, BlackBerry moved into the autonomous driving world with its QNX Autonomous Vehicle Innovation Centre. BlackBerry reached a deal with Ford (F  -  Free Report) to send some of its software developers to the car giant to help work on driverless car technology.The company also recently received a boost from Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report), which reached an $815 million deal to pay BlackBerry past-due royalty fees. The repayment plan helped set up BlackBerry’s stock buyback of 31 million common shares. Still, despite a few apparent positives, the analyst noted multiple reasons to be cautious of BlackBerry going forward.“However, with automotive not likely ramping materially until 2019/2020 (based on management comments and 2-3 year production cycles), we believe near-term fundamentals will still matter for the stock (as evidenced by 15% underperformance post the last earnings report, after reporting 1Q18 revenue 9% below the Street),” Borges wrote in a note to clients.“On this point, we believe the enterprise mobility market is becoming incrementally more competitive, in part due to bundling from larger suite providers, and in part due to growth from non-regulated industries, where BlackBerry’s product is less well positioned. We are 3% below the Street on FY18 revenue and 8% below on FY19.”Shares of BlackBerry dipped by 3.76% in morning trading. The company is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), but scored an “F” grade for both Value and Momentum in our Style Score system.BlackBerry SalesBlackBerry’s software sales gained 2% year-over-year last quarter to $169 million. The small increase seemed to not have been enough as the company’s stock price has fallen from $11.06 per share to the $9.06 a share it rests at today, since it reported its first-quarter earnings in late June.The company began to transition away from the BlackBerry smartphones that made the company famous. However, BlackBerry’s newest phone offering, the KeyOne, which it licensed to Chinese manufacturer TCL Communications, failed to lift its non-software business. BlackBerry’s hardware revenues plummeted 76% from the year-ago period.5 Trades Could Profit ""Big-League"" from Trump PoliciesIf the stocks above spark your interest, wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington's changing course.Today Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals, tariffs, lower taxes, higher interest rates, and spending surges in defense and infrastructure.

2500,QCOM,"NXP Semiconductors NV (NXPI  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter 2017 earnings of 14 cents per share, which improved significantly from a loss of 4 cents per share reported in the year-ago quarter.Notably, similar to the first quarter, NXP Semiconductors didn’t provide much detail about the latest quarterly performance, as well as guidance for the forthcoming quarter due to its pending acquisition by QUALCOMM Incorporated (QCOM  -  Free Report).Quarter DetailsNXP Semiconductors’ revenues declined 6.9% year over year to $2.202 billion, chiefly due to loss of revenues resulting from the divestment of its Standard Products business in early February. However, quarterly revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.188 billion.NXP Semiconductors’ reported gross margin expanded 270 basis points (bps) year over year to 49.2%, primarily due to lower cost of sales. Non-GAAP gross profit margin during the quarter was 53% compared with 50% reported in the year-ago quarter.The company’s operating margin came in at 2.3% during the quarter, marking a 340 bps improvement from the year-ago quarter’s negative operating margin of 1.1%. The improvement was primarily due to the one-time gain related to the divestment of Standard Products.On a non-GAAP basis, operating margin was 28.4% compared with 25.6% reported in the year-ago period. The increase was mainly due to lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenues and higher gross margin. Non-GAAP operating expenses, as a percentage of revenues, decreased to 29.2% from 29.6% reported in the year-ago quarter.The company’s reported net income attributable to shareholders was $49 million against net loss of $13 million in the year-ago quarter.NXP Semiconductors N.V. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise NXP Semiconductors N.V. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | NXP Semiconductors N.V. QuoteNXP Semiconductors exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of approximately $2.642 billion compared with $2.238 billion at the end of first quarter. Receivables were $915 million at the end of the quarter compared with $983 million reported in the previous quarter. The company’s balance sheet has long-term debt of $5.790 billion compared with $6.498 billion at the end of the previous quarter.NXP Semiconductors generated cash flow from operations of $625 million during the quarter. Free cash flow was $345 million. During the quarter, NXP Semiconductors repurchased approximately 0.96 million shares for $10 million.Our TakeNXP Semiconductors, a global semiconductor company, is known for its automotive and chip identification business and has seen massive growth in the portable device segment in the last one year. Continued strong adoption of tablets and smartphones, automotive electronics and the emergence of the new category of wearables provided a boost to the demand for processing and sensing devices that run them.Nonetheless, macroeconomic weakness, competition from Xilinx Inc. (XLNX  -  Free Report) and Lattice Semiconductor Corp., consolidation in the telecom market and volatility in the semiconductor market remain headwinds.Currently, NXP Semiconductor carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Notably, in the last one year the stock has returned 13.1%, underperforming the industry’s gain of 14.2%.A promising stock in the same industry space is MaxLinear, Inc (MXL  -  Free Report), which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

2501,QCOM,"Intel Corp (INTC  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 27. Notably, the company has a positive record of earnings surprises in the trailing four quarters, with an average surprise of 6.95%.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 1.54%. Non-GAAP earnings of 66 cents per share surged 22% from the year-ago quarter but declined 16.5% sequentially.Strong year-over-year earnings growth was driven by 7.2% increase in revenues, which totaled $14.80 billion but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $14.81 billion. Revenues decreased 9.6% sequentially.Intel guided second-quarter 2017 revenues of around $14.4 billion (+/-$500 million), almost flat sequentially and up 6% year over year. Excluding Intel Security Group business, revenues are projected to grow 11% on a year-on-year basis.The non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be around 63% (+/-2%), flat sequentially. R&D and MG&A expenses are anticipated to amount at around $5.2 billion. Intel Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Intel Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Intel Corporation QuoteOperating income is projected to be approximately $3.9 billion, while EPS is anticipated to be 68 cents (+/- 5 cents), up 15% on a year-over-year basis.Despite the positive guidance, Intel’s shares have underperformed the S&P 500 on a year-to-date basis primarily due to rising competition in most of the markets. While the index gained 10.7%, the stock has returned a negative 4.2%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayWe note that Intel’s growing focus into areas with better growth prospects, such as the artificial intelligence (AI), autonomous car and Internet of Things (IoT) businesses are key catalysts. In this regard, the acquisition of Mobileye is a significant development that will boost its presence in the autonomous vehicle market.However, increasing competition in the data center market is a headwind. Reportedly, Microsoft is collaborating with ARM chip-makers, Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report) and Cavium, to design ARM-based servers. The server will run a major part of the company cloud services going ahead. Additionally, increasing competition from AMD's recently launched EPYC server chip is also a threat.  Market research firm, Gartner, stated that worldwide server shipments decreased 4.2% year over year to 2.60 million units in the first quarter of 2017. Moreover, worldwide server revenues declined 4.5%. Data from another market research firm, IDC, showed that although server shipments increased 1.4% year over year to 2.21 million units, worldwide server revenues declined 4.6%.Sluggish high-end server sales affected results. IDC noted that, “server market growth continues to slow down with most hyperscale service providers waiting until the second half of the year for deployment of Intel's new Skylake processors.”The data center business now comprises a major part of Intel’s overall business (29% of 2016 revenues). Hence, a decline in the server shipment and revenues amid intense competition is a major concern for the company.Notably, Intel recently launched its Xeon (formerly Skylake) scalable ‘Purley’, a next-generation server processor platform. However, it is unlikely to have much positive impact on top-line growth in the going-to-be-reported quarter.We also note that the top-PC makers like HP, Lenovo, and Asus are set to launch PCs based on Qualcomm’s ARM-based Snapdragon processor, which intensifies competition for Intel. Moreover, declining PC shipment is a major concern for the company.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Intel will beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Intel’s Earnings ESP is currently -1.47%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of 67 cents is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 68 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Intel carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderYou could consider the following stocks with a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank.Cypress Semiconductor (CY  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +11.11% and sports a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.IPG Photonics Corporation (IPGP  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +3.07% and boasts a Zacks Rank #1. More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

2502,QCOM,"Per a recent report by Forbes, U.S. mobile chipset giant, Qualcomm Inc.’s (QCOM  -  Free Report) proposed acquisition of Netherlands-based mobile chipset giant NXP Semiconductors NV (NXPI  -  Free Report) is facing a few problems.In October 2016, Qualcomm entered into a definitive agreement with NXP to buy the latter. Per the deal, Qualcomm would bel paying $110 per NXP share in cash reflecting an enterprise value of approximately $47 billion (equity value of $39 billion) for the Dutch chipset maker. The deal is likely to be closed by the end of 2017 subject to all necessary regulatory approvals.Per the report, hedge fund Elliott Management Corp. and two other large shareholders of NXP have approached the company to renegotiate the terms of the deal, which they consider grossly undervalued. In August 2017, Elliot Management disclosed that it had accumulated shares and derivatives amounting to a 6% stake in NXP Semiconductor. Majority of the company’s shareholders are now reluctant to tender their shares at the rate specified by Qualcomm.Consequently, NXP’s outstanding shares tendered have declined from 17.2% in March 2017 to just 6.9% in August. Notably, at least 70% of NXP’s total outstanding shares must be tendered to Qualcomm for deal to go through. Hence, the deal looks quite unlikely unless Qualcomm adds some sweeteners.Meanwhile, in June 2017, the telecom regulatory body of the European Union, the European Commission (EC), launched a thorough investigation into the proposed acquisition. The EC will probe in-depth if the deal could lead to higher prices, exclusion of rival chipset suppliers and reduced innovation in the semiconductor industry. The merged entity is likely to command strong market positions with an extensive portfolio of baseband chipsets and chips for near-field communications. The EC has a 90-working-days’ time limit, until Oct 17, 2017, to take a decision. Notably, the proposed merger has already been approved by the U.S. antitrust authorities.NXP Semiconductors is the largest manufacturer of high-performance, mixed-signal mobile chipsets with 14% market share. The company has a strong clientele serving more than 25,000 customers through its direct sales channel and global network of distribution channel partners. The combined entity is expected to generate annual revenues of more than $30 billion. Further, it is likely to position itself as a strong player in the next-generation mobile chipset segment with a potential market size of $138 billion by 2020.Qualcomm expects the transaction to be significantly accretive to its non-GAAP EPS immediately upon completion. Further, the company expects to generate $500 million of annualized run-rate cost synergies within two years after the transaction closes.Advantages to QualcommThe major positive of the deal is that it will enable Qualcomm to diversify its business model. The company is a leader in the mobile chipset market. However, in recent years, markets for smartphones and tablets have gradually slowed down. Moreover, these chipset businesses are low-margin in nature. For the last couple of years, the company’s business has remained stagnant.On the other hand, NXP manufactures chips for next-generation automotive, industrial and Internet of Things (IoT) segments. Therefore, acquisition of NXP will help Qualcomm in diversifying into highly lucrative end markets such as auto, secured devices, connectivity and secure payments. These segments offer high-margin businesses with strong potential for future growth.The transaction will place Qualcomm in the second position after Intel Corp. (INTC  -  Free Report) in terms of sales in the broader global semiconductor market. Moreover, the combined entity will also become a formidable challenger to other large semiconductor firms like Broadcom Ltd. (AVGO  -  Free Report), Analog Devices Inc. (ADI  -  Free Report) and ARM Holdings.Price Performance of QualcommQualcomm’s shares have decreased 12.11% compared with the industry’s decline of 6.51% in the last three months.

2503,QCOM,"Though most of the major telecom stocks lost value over the last week, the sector witnessed a number of important events.The U.S. telecom regulator, Federal Communications Commission (FCC), recently closed the window for comments and replies after receiving 22 million comments on Net Neutrality rules. The regulatory body will examine these suggestions before taking a final call. However, the FCC Chairman Ajit Pai is yet to announce a deadline for finalizing the rules. Notably, the FCC voted 2-1 in favor of starting the process of unwinding the Net Neutrality rules in May 2017.U.S. telecom giant Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report) has strengthened its targeted advertising tool, – Verizon Select, with rewards program called Verizon Up. However, the rewards will be available only after customers provide their web-browsing history, app usage and location data.

2504,QCOM,"Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM  -  Free Report) recently revised its proposed deal to takeover NXP Semiconductors N.V. (NXPI  -  Free Report) in order to get regulatory nod from the European Commission (EC), which is a major part of the European Union. Notably, Qualcomm’s proposed acquisition of NXP Semiconductors is facing a few problems.On Oct 27, 2016, Qualcomm entered into a definitive agreement with the Netherlands-based mobile chipset giant to buy the latter. Per the deal, Qualcomm would be paying $110 per NXP share in cash, reflecting an enterprise value of approximately $47 billion (equity value of $39 billion) for NXP. The deal is likely to be closed by the end of 2017, subject to all necessary regulatory approvals.In June 2017, the EC had launched a thorough investigation into the proposed acquisition. The EC will probe in depth to see if the deal will lead to higher prices, exclusion of rival chipset suppliers and reduced innovation in the semiconductor industry. The merged entity is likely to command strong market positions with an extensive portfolio of baseband chipsets and chips for near-field communications. The EC has time till Oct 17, 2017, to take a decision. The EC has already halted its review twice -- once in June and again in August. Notably, the proposed merger has already been approved by the U.S. antitrust authorities.On October 5, 2017, the U.S. mobile chipset giant submitted its new proposal to the EC. According to Reuters, “Qualcomm has told regulators it will not acquire NXP's standard essential patents, which the Dutch company can sell to another buyer, the sources said. The company also agreed not to take legal action against third parties related to NXP's near field communication (NFC) patents except for defensive purposes. NXP co-invented NFC chips, which enable mobile phones to be used to pay for goods and store and exchange data”.Importantly, in September 2017, Qualcomm extended the offering period of its previously announced cash tender offer of purchasing all the outstanding common shares of NXP. The tender offer will now expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on Oct. 20, 2017.Meanwhile, hedge fund Elliott Management Corp. and two other large shareholders of NXP have approached the company to renegotiate the terms of the deal, which they consider grossly undervalued. In August 2017, Elliot Management disclosed that it had accumulated shares and derivatives amounting to a 6% stake in NXP Semiconductor. Majority of the company’s shareholders are now reluctant to tender their shares at the rate specified by Qualcomm.Consequently, NXP’s outstanding shares tendered have declined from 17.2% in March 2017 to 3.2% in September. Notably, at least 70% of NXP’s total outstanding shares must be tendered to Qualcomm for the deal to go through. Hence, the deal looks quite unlikely unless Qualcomm adds some sweeteners.NXP Semiconductors is the largest manufacturer of high-performance, mixed-signal mobile chipsets with 14% market share. The company has a strong clientele serving more than 25,000 customers through its direct sales channel and global network of distribution channel partners. The combined entity is expected to generate annual revenues of more than $30 billion. Moreover, it is likely to position itself as a strong player in the next-generation mobile chipset segment with a potential market size of $138 billion by 2020.Qualcomm expects the transaction to be significantly accretive to its non-GAAP EPS immediately upon completion. Further, the company expects to generate $500 million of annualized run-rate cost synergies within two years of the closure of the transaction.Advantages to QualcommThe major positive of the deal is that it will enable Qualcomm to diversify its business model. The company is a leader in the mobile chipset market. However, in recent years, markets for smartphones and tablets have gradually slowed down. Moreover, these chipset businesses are low-margin in nature. For the last couple of years, the company’s business has remained stagnant.On the other hand, NXP manufactures chips for next-generation automotive, industrial and Internet of Things (IoT) segments. Therefore, acquisition of NXP will help Qualcomm in diversifying into highly lucrative end markets such as auto, secured devices, connectivity and secure payments. These segments offer high-margin businesses with strong potential for future growth.The transaction will place Qualcomm in the second position after Intel Corp. (INTC  -  Free Report) in terms of sales in the broader global semiconductor market. Moreover, the combined entity will also become a formidable challenger to other large semiconductor firms like Broadcom Ltd. (AVGO  -  Free Report), Analog Devices Inc. (ADI  -  Free Report) and ARM Holdings.Price Performance of QualcommQualcomm’s shares have decreased 4.15% compared with the industry’s decline of 2.25% in the last three months.

2505,QCOM,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has long been touted as the next big thing in the technology sector, and its usage is growing each and every day. Over the last few years, NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) has been working hard to establish itself in this space and the driverless cars industry.The graphic chip behemoth unveiled a new AI supercomputer chip designed for self-driving cars called Pegasus at its GPU Technology Conference (GTC) in Europe, yesterday.This new technology, Pegasus helps to drive fully autonomous robotaxis which can handle the concept of Level 5 self-driving vehicles and uses NVIDIA’s DRIVE PX 2 platform, trained on deep neural networks.What’s the Specialty?Pegasus is a system-on-chip (SoC) which is built on the NVIDIA Volta architecture-based GPUs. Pegasus also integrates a new computer vision accelerator aimed for ASIL D certification — the industry's highest safety level. It also features multiple 10Gbit Ethernet connectors.Per the company, the new system is capable of delivering 320 trillion operations per second (TOPS) of performance, which is more than 10 times as compared with its predecessor. The company expects making the processor available to automakers and other groups developing self-driving cars in the second half of 2018.NVIDIA’s Hold in AINVIDIA’s foray into the autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space has been driving its stock higher since mid-2015. It hasn’t looked back since then and has been continuously bringing in new and more advanced technologies in the space.Notably, the stock has been clocking solid returns over the past one year and has gained 184.4%, outperforming the industry’s gain of just about 41%.With its sustained focus on developing new and more advanced AI technologies for self-diving cars, we believe that the company is well poised to become a leading provider of technology for autonomous vehicles. Estimates provided by various research firms further encourage us about NVIDIA’s growth prospects in the space.According to data available from BI intelligence, 10 million self-driving cars will be on the road by 2020. Per Statista, the market for fully autonomous vehicles will grow to almost $6 billion while partially autonomous vehicles market will reach $36 billion by 2025. According to Boston Consulting Group estimates, the autonomous car market will be worth $42 billion by 2025 and $77 billion by 2035.The recent launch is seen as NVIDIA’s determined focus on remaining ahead of its rivals — Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report) and Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM  -  Free Report) — in the driverless car technology space. The competition in the industry has already heated up with Intel’s recent deal to acquire Mobileye N.V.  for $15.3 billion.Bottom LineNVIDIA continues to be the world’s biggest graphic processing hardware provider for PCs since the past several decades. The company’s efforts toward autonomous vehicle and the AI segment shows that it intends to be the largest player in the self-driving and machine learning arena too. Furthermore, by expanding business avenues, the company will be able to reduce dependency on the PC industry, which is currently declining.Given the accelerated momentum in gaming, datacenter and automotive technology, we believe that this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock with a long-term EPS growth estimate of 10.3% will continue to rally.

2507,QCOM,"When one thinks about the American technology sector, their mind naturally conjures up images of Silicon Valley, an industry oasis located in the southern portion of the San Francisco Bay Area. Named after the large number of silicon chip manufacturers in the area, Silicon Valley has been the U.S. tech capital for decades and is home to a number of industry behemoths.There’s really nothing wrong about associating American tech with the Valley. It’s true, there are almost too many household names in region to count. Take a trip to the area and you’ll find the international headquarters of Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Intel (INTC  -  Free Report), Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report), Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report), and many, many more.Nevertheless, success in today’s tech industry does not necessarily depend on setting up shop in Silicon Valley. Throughout the country, city and state governments have lobbied to keep their talent at home, and we’re seeing a new generation of startups appear in a variety of emerging markets.This new generation—one that doesn’t feel the need to pack up and move to Silicon Valley immediately—owes its inspiration to a number of massively successful firms that chose to take the same path.Check out five of our favorite American tech companies that are not based in Silicon Valley:1.       Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report)Headquarters: Redmond, WashingtonMicrosoft found its home in Redmond in 1986, just weeks before the company went public. Today, the software innovator’s main campus, which is located at “One Microsoft Way,” is home to an estimated 40,000 employees. Microsoft is actually in the process of expanding its Silicon Valley campus right now, and it does operate an East Coast headquarters in Charlotte, North Carolina, but Redmond had been an integral part of the company’s history—and it will likely remain that way for the foreseeable future. 2.       Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report)Headquarters: Seattle, WashingtonWith Microsoft already proving that the Pacific Northwest could support tech companies, Amazon’s meteoric rise to e-commerce royalty simply cemented Washington as “Silicon Valley North.” Here’s a fun fact: Amazon currently occupies about 19% of all prime office space in its hometown, the most of any employer in a major U.S. city. What’s more, Amazon’s office space takes up a greater amount of square footage in Seattle than any other single company in a major American city. 3.       Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report)Headquarters: San Diego, CaliforniaWhile many of its semiconductor rivals call the San Francisco area home, Qualcomm has opted to keep its operations in the warmer climate of sunny San Diego. The company is the second-largest private employer in the city, behind only non-profit healthcare services firm Sharp HealthCare. Qualcomm also makes its presence known throughout San Diego. The chipmaker held the naming rights to Qualcomm Stadium, the longtime home of the former San Diego Chargers, for over 20 years. 4.       CDW Corporation (CDW  -  Free Report)Headquarters: Lincolnshire, IllinoisCDW, which started when its founder flipped used PCs for small profits, has grown into a $10 billion enterprise technology powerhouse over the course of three decades. Headquartered in the Chicago suburbs of Lincolnshire and Vernon Hills, CDW is able to poach top talent from the universities in the Windy City and throughout the Midwest—a region not traditionally known for its tech industry. 5.       Red Hat (RHT  -  Free Report)Headquarters: Raleigh, North CarolinaOpen source software leader Red Hat finds itself in the heart of North Carolina’s infamous “Research Triangle,” which houses several major tech and pharmaceutical firms. While several of these industry giants use the Raleigh-Durham area as an East Coast hub, Red Hat calls the Triangle its permanent global headquarters. The “corners” of this region are marked by North Carolina State University, Duke University, and the University of North Carolina, so Red Hat has plenty of talent to choose from. Want more stock market analysis from this author?

2509,QCOM,"Shares of Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report) were down more than 4% through early afternoon trading hours Tuesday after the chipmaker lost its legal bid to postpone changes to its cellular patent licensing process in South Korea.The semiconductor manufacturing giant confirmed on Monday night that the Seoul High Court had denied its application to put a stay on a remedial order by the Korea Fair Trade Commission over the way it licenses cellular patents.Qualcomm was seeking to delay the Fair Trade Commission’s order while the company appeals the regulator body’s findings in court. Nevertheless, South Korea denied the request and ruled that Qualcomm’s business would not suffer irreparable harm if the order took effect during the appeals process.Qualcomm shares dropped about 4% to $50.08 by early afternoon. However, at least one analyst argued that the ruling wouldn’t really have a major effect on the company’s results.“While this is interesting, we do not believe it affects QCOM treatment in other countries,” said JPMorgan’s Rod Hall in a note. “We also point out that the smartphone volumes in Korea are tiny relative to global volume and have little impact on Qualcomm’s licensing revenue stream.”Indeed, Qualcomm’s slump appears to be coming on a weak day throughout the semiconductor industry. The iShares PHLX Semiconductor Sector ETF (SOXX  -  Free Report) was down more than 1.5%, while major chipmakers like AMD (AMD  -  Free Report) and Nvidia (NVDA  -  Free Report) were down more than 3%.Other industry giants, including Micron Technology (MU), Applied Materials (AMAT  -  Free Report), Analog Devices (ADI  -  Free Report), and Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report), also fell on Tuesday. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index was down over 1.3% through Tuesday afternoon trading.Tech’s rough day was mirrored by nearly all major sectors, as several major international stories, as well as the onset of the market’s historic worst month, helped drag stocks down on Tuesday (also read: Stocks Dip To Start September, The Market's Traditional Worst Month).Want more stock market analysis from this author?

2510,QCOM,"On Aug 31, we issued an updated research report on California-based Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report). The company is one of the world’s largest manufacturers of semiconductor products.Intel has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 5.59%. The company reported better-than-expected fiscal second-quarter 2017 results. Both the top and bottom lines surpassed the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate and also improved year over year.Moreover, management raised the bottom-line guidance for fiscal 2017. Earnings are now anticipated to be $3.00 (+/- 5%) per share, up from the previous guidance of $2.85.Notably, Intel stock has lost 2.1% year to date, underperforming the 18% rally of the industry it belongs to. We believe that new product releases along with improving growth opportunities in Artificial Intelligence (AI), Virtual Reality (VR), High Performance Computing (HPC) and Internet of Things (IoT) will help shares rebound in the long run.Key FactorsIntel’s recent launch of Xeon Scalable (formerly known as Skylake), which is 1.6 times faster than the prior-generation product is a game changer in our view. The company had already delivered 500,000 units of Xeon Scalable to over 30 customers till the announcement of second-quarter results.Intel also unveiled Movidius Myriad X chip aimed at deep learning, which will ultimately strengthen its position in the IoT market.Moreover, the company is focused on fast penetrating the rapidly growing advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). The acquisition of MobilEye has significantly expanded its product portfolio.Intel Corporation Revenue (TTM) Intel Corporation Revenue (TTM) | Intel Corporation QuoteFurther, the announcement of the formation of a consortium for building autonomous car ecosystem is a key catalyst as it improves Intel’s competitive position against the likes of Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report).Additionally, we expect the launch of Core 8 processors to boost the company’s PC market share amid intense competition from Advanced Micro Devices Inc.

2511,QCOM,"National provider of mobile communications services, T-Mobile US Inc. (TMUS  -  Free Report) has been a pioneer in innovative network expansion methodologies. Such initiatives have helped the carrier lure 1.333 million subscribers in the last reported second quarter of 2017.Meanwhile, by virtue of its continuous 4G LTE network improvement and expansion, T-Mobile US has already started deploying 600-MHz low-band spectrum on its 4G LTE network (from mid August). The company claims to be the world’s first to launch 4G in 600-MHz band and its first deployment site is Cheyenne, WY.T-Mobile US announced the availability of a handset, LG V30, which will support the company’s 600-MHz LTE network. The latest location to go live with its new super spectrum is Scarborough, ME. The LG V30 will be the world’s first smartphone to support LTE on 600-MHz as well as other spectrum bands available from T-Mobile US. The company’s marketing campaign plans to launch LG’s latest flagship nationwide this fall.Update on 600-MHz LTE Deployment T-Mobile US has started the deployment in rural and suburban markets although it has been focused on urban markets in the last few years. By the end of this year, T-Mobile US plans to launch 600-MHz LTE network in Wyoming, Northeast and Southwest Oregon, West Texas, Southwest Kansas, the Oklahoma panhandle, Western North Dakota, additional areas of Maine, Coastal North Carolina, Central Pennsylvania, Central Virginia and Eastern Washington. This should increase the company’s total LTE coverage from 315 million customers to 321 million by year’s end.Going forward, T-Mobile US is planning to complete the roll out of the spectrum within six months. Also, the company has agreed to invest in broadcast equipment manufacturing capacity, installation resources, help for low-power TV stations and support for TV translator licenses to finish the deployment as soon as possible.T-Mobile US is working closely with the U.S. telecom regulator, Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and broadcasters like Public Broadcasting Service to complete the spectrum deployment on time. T-Mobile US is also working closely with network infrastructure partners, chipset makers and device manufacturers. In addition to LG, the company is also working with Samsung to launch phones that supports the spectrum. Nokia Corporation (NOK  -  Free Report) and Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM  -  Free Report) have launched new technology, that are compatible with the new spectrum band.In addition to expanding and strengthening its LTE network with 600-MHz spectrum, T-Mobile US announced plans for a nationwide 5G network on this super-premium low-band spectrum. By deploying Ericsson’s (ERIC  -  Free Report) new radio equipment, the Un-carrier is making 600-MHz LTE available while building a seamless path to 5G on 600 MHz.Notably, low-band spectrum is essential for wireless operators as the signals can be transmitted over longer distances and through brick-and-mortar walls in cities.T-Mobile US has doubled its LTE coverage since 2015 and its newly acquired premium low band wireless spectrum (from FCC’s Incentive Auction in April 2017) will further broaden its LTE footprint.  Furthermore, the company acquired the largest portion (nearly 45%) of the available spectrums by offering a sum of nearly $8 billion. It won 1,525 licenses and bought around 31 MHz of spectrums in the 600-MHz low-band frequencies.Apart from upgrading and innovating its new super spectrum for LTE, T-Mobile US is also laying the foundation for the country’s first nationwide 5G network.Currently, it is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.

2512,QCOM,"U.S. telecom behemoth AT&T Inc.’s (T  -  Free Report) DirecTV deceptive advertising lawsuit filed by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in Mar 2015, is currently on trial in the federal court. The FTC wants the company to pay upto $3.95 billion as monetary relief for affected customers.The trial became functional from this Monday with opening arguments in U.S. District Court in Oakland, CA, and is scheduled to last 20 days.FTC lawyer Jacob A. Snow clearly pointed out that 33 consumers were deceived by the company during the span of 2007-2015.  As a result of sign-ups and deceptive practices, DirecTV is estimated to have made $3.95 billion.FTC’s Claims AT&T’s DirecTV was charged for misleading customers through false marketing campaigns and not disclosing all its terms, which violated one of the FTC’s Acts. The company advertised only the first 12-month-subscription fee in a two-year contract. Moreover, it did not mention a $480 fine, in case of an early cancelation of the contract. Also, the FTC claimed that DirecTV’s website was confusing and did not convey any detailed information related to any purchase. The agency accused the company of misleading customers about free three-month trials of premium channels such as HBO and Showtime.Recent LawsuitsLast week, the United States International Trade Commission (ITC) announced its decision to investigate a complaint filed by chipset manufacturer, Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM  -  Free Report) against tech giant Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) for infringing six of its patents covering various aspects of mobile phone technology. ITC had mentioned about establishing a deadline for finalizing its probe within the next 45 days.Earlier, Qualcomm had settled a licensing dispute with BlackBerry Ltd.  by paying $940 million. This is in relation to the over-payment by BlackBerry to Qualcomm in royalty payments from 2010 to 2015 under terms of a licensing deal.Bottom LineLawsuits or legal proceedings, along with related fines, act as major dampeners for any company’s financials and long-term growth. These charges affect the company’s credit ratings. To remain clean in every aspect, a company should avoid illegal business practices and other similar activities. Major regulatory bodies such as the United States telecom regulator, Federal Communications Commission (FCC), or the Mexican telecom regulator, Federal Telecommunications Institute (IFT), approve different deals, mergers and acquisitions. They can also punish the players when caught violating a business norm or engaging in illicit and unlicensed dealings.We hope AT&T will easily recover from its DirecTV trial as it is anticipating the integration of the satellite operator’s core operations to drive new products like DirecTV Now. Recently, both AT&T and the Communications Workers of America (CWA) have finally approved a four-year contract with the telco’s Pacific Bell and Nevada Bell subsidiaries. This new agreement was signed on Jul 14, after extensive discussions between AT&T, the CWA and a federal mediator provided through the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service. Price Performance and Zacks RankIn the past three months, AT&T’s shares have returned 1.87%, but failed to beat the 5.05% growth of the industry to which it belongs.

2514,QCOM,"U.S. telecom giant, Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report), recently formed a consortium to carry out the first use of CBRS (Citizens Broadband Radio Service) band 48 spectrum in an 4G LTE Advanced (LTE-A) carrier aggregation demonstration. The CBRS band comprises 150 MHz of 3.5 GHz shared spectrum. Historically these frequencies were primarily used by the U.S. government for radar systems.Other members of this consortium are mobile chipset behemoth Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM  -  Free Report), major telecom equipment vendor Ericsson AB (ERIC  -  Free Report) and Federated Wireless. The first demonstration was conducted in an Ericsson lab in Plano (Texas) using 2x20 MHz LTE carriers along with a 256 QAM modulation in the downlink. Qualcomm provided a Snapdragon LTE modem test device and Federated Wireless provided the spectrum management service with its spectrum controller.Verizon is also planning to deploy small cells – both low power and high power – using the 3.5 GHz band. The company has long been involved in small cell densification and expansion of its dark fiber footprint strategy in relation to upcoming 5G wireless technology trials and launch.Verizon is actively working with multiple vendor partners and testing 3.5 GHz equipment this year, both in lab and field tests. The company’s officials mentioned that they have already conducted infrastructure testing. Meanwhile, in March 2017, the FCC awarded AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report) a license to test a 3.5 GHz network.We believe that the increase in the adoption of small cells is because of the inconvenience of installing large towers in inaccessible areas. Verizon stated that the small cells will be used to augment its existing 4G LTE and upcoming 5G network and will primarily concentrate on high traffic locations like a business district or shopping mall. Verizon expects small cells to increase its voice capacity and data speeds as well as complement its current LTE infrastructure. However, providing emergency power backup remains a major headwind for small cells.Price Performance of VerizonVerizon’s shares have increased 7.26%, outperforming the industry’s gain of 1.17% in the last three months.

You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It’s All About EarningsGiven the stock market’s record run this year, Wall Street is keeping a close eye on quarterly earnings.  This could be an excellent earnings season for the S&P 500, which in turn will boost its operating earnings per share for the trailing 12 months. Improved second-quarter economic growth, strong manufacturing and service surveys, and a moderate uptick in wage growth are expected to help Corporate America post relatively high profit margins in Q2. Earnings growth is expected to be led by energy, financials and information technology (read more: Wall Street to See Terrific Q2 Earnings: 5 Top Gainers).According to estimates, total second-quarter earnings for the S&P 500 cohort are expected to be up 6.6% from same period last year on 4.5% higher revenues. This would follow earnings growth of 13.3% in Q1 on 7% revenue growth, the highest in at least two years. Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research, further added that history shows the final tally will be better in Q2 “as actual EPS exceeded initial estimates in each of the last 21 quarters and have done so by an average of 3.6 percentage points.”If we move beyond Q2, total earnings for the S&P 500 cohort are anticipated to increase 6.1% on 4.5% higher revenues in Q3 and gain by 9.7% on 5.2% higher revenues in Q4. For the entire year, total earnings for the index are expected to be up 7.4% on 4.1% higher revenues. This will be way more than 1% earnings growth on 2% higher revenues recorded last year (read more: Bank Earnings in the Spotlight).Meanwhile, the world’s largest asset manager BlackRock, Inc.’s (BLK  -  Free Report) quarterly profit came in below expectations. BlackRock reported second-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of $5.24 per share, which lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.39. Lower-than-expected results were primarily due to a rise in operating expenses and lower investment advisory performance fees (read more: BlackRock Q2 Earnings Lag Estimates as Expenses Rise).Stocks that made HeadlinesSpirit Airlines June Load Factor Falls, Q2 TRASM View RaisedSpirit Airlines (SAVE  -  Free Report)  saw a 17% rise in traffic (measured in Revenue Passenger Miles or RPMs) to approximately 2.2 billion in Jun 2017 on a year-over-year basis.

2517,QCOM,"Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM  -  Free Report), the largest manufacturer of wireless chipsets based on baseband technology, has been fined with 580,000 euros ($665,000) per day after losing a court bid against European Union (EU).Earlier, Qualcomm had appealed to the Luxembourg-based General Court to suspend a case filed against it by the telecom regulatory body of the EU, the European Commission (EC). EC accused Qualcomm of using anti-competitive methods to throw out British phone software maker Icera. The company failed to provide EU antitrust regulators with information and has lost the appeal against the penalty in an EU court on Jul 1.EU General Court President, Marc Jaeger, clearly stated that it is mandatory for Qualcomm to answer the regulator's questions during the proceedings. The company was given a Jun 30 deadline to respond to unanswered questions. If the company continues with the uncooperative and uncoordinated attitude, then it may encounter a series of penalties with several millions of euros as fine.The risk of new fines adds to Qualcomm’s ongoing regulatory proceedings. The company continues to receive charges due to unfair business practices and licensing royalty payments. Last month, it settled a licensing dispute with BlackBerry Limited  by paying $940 million on May 31. Meanwhile, the ongoing $1-billion lawsuit dispute (since Jan, 2017) with tech giant Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) is getting uglier with each day, which is affecting the company’s margins. To this end, Qualcomm recently filed a complaint with the United States International Trade Commission (ITC) against Apple for infringing six of its patents covering various aspects of mobile phone technology. Qualcomm has requested ITC to investigate Apple's infringing imports and issue a Limited Exclusion Order (LEO) to ban importation of iPhones and other products linked with the patent in the U.S.Moreover, Qualcomm’s proposed deal to acquire Netherlands-based mobile chipset giant NXP Semiconductors is on hold as of now. The deal is under a thorough investigation by the EC, which will probe to check whether the deal could lead to higher prices, exclusion of rival chipset suppliers and reduced innovation in the semiconductor industry.Qualcomm is under EU’s scrutiny for its numerous dealings. We expect the company to quickly resolve such disputes and focus on its expansion strategies which include its Snapdragon processors known for its Internet of Things (IoT) applications, patent license deals entailing 3G and 4G networks, tie-up with AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report) and Ericsson to test 5G New Radio specification and the launch of China’s first end-to-end data call. Moreover, the company is foraying into areas like automotive, networking and mobile computing. Despite such booming prospects, over the past three months, share price of Qualcomm inched up 7.32% but failed to beat the Zacks categorized Wireless Equipment industry’s 9.82% gain.We believe tough competition in the mobile phone chipset market, stringent regulatory norms along with anti-competitive and unfair business practices charges resulted in the company’s below-par performance and current Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.5 Trades Could Profit ""Big-League"" from Trump PoliciesIf the stocks above spark your interest, wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington's changing course.Today Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals, tariffs, lower taxes, higher interest rates, and spending surges in defense and infrastructure.

2518,QCOM,"Wokday Inc. (WDAY  -  Free Report) reported fiscal second-quarter 2018 non-GAAP earnings of 24 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 15 cents.Revenues of $525.3 million increased 39.1% year over year and beat the consensus mark of $507.4 million. The figure was much better than the guided range of $505–$508 million.Subscription revenues (82.7% of total revenue) soared 42% year over year to $434.5 million, driven by strong net new customer wins and renewals. The figure surpassed the guided range of $420–$432 million. Professional services revenues (17.3% of total revenue) grew 34% from the year-ago quarter to $91 million and were better than the guided figure of $85 million.Notably, Citigroup Management Corporation (C  -  Free Report), Nordstrom, Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report) and Humana were added as human capital management (HCM) customers in the reported quarter. The company’s financial management application was chosen by the likes of Ohio Health Corporation, The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, Giant Tiger Stores and Carlyle in the reported quarter.Geographically, revenues outside the U.S. (20% of total revenue) increased 59% to $106 million, which is indicative of the company’s growing international foothold. Reportedly, Munich Germany-based manufacturing giant Siemens replaced their current HR system with Workday HCM. Additionally, in Europe and Asia Pacific’s Japan region, the company added Shell and Johnson Electric, respectively as customers.Notably, shares of Workday have gained 62.3% year to date, substantially outperforming the industry’s18.1% rally.Operating ResultsThe company reported non-GAAP operating income of $49 million compared with $6.1 million in the prior-year quarter.Non-GAAP operating margin expanded 770 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter to 9.3%.Workday, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Workday, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Workday, Inc. QuoteBalance SheetWorkday exited the quarter with total cash and cash equivalents (including marketable securities) of $2.01 billion compared with nearly $2.0 billion as on Jan 31, 2017.Workday’s cash from operating activities for the quarter ended Jul 31, 2017 was $15.1 million compared with $6.5 million in the year-ago period.The company’s free cash outflow was $23.4 million in the quarter, greater than an outflow of $20 million in the prior-year quarter.OutlookFor fiscal third-quarter 2018, Workday expects revenues in the range of $538-$540 million. Subscription revenues are anticipated in the range of $450-$452 million, while professional services revenue expectation is $88 million.Workday anticipates non-GAAP operating margins to decline sequentially and be in the range of 5-6%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at earnings of 9 cents per share on revenues of $522.05 million.Buoyed by the encouraging first-half results, the company raised its guidance for fiscal 2018. Revenues are anticipated to be in the range of $2.093-$2.1 billion, up from the prior guidance of $2.04-$2.05 billion. The company now expects non-GAAP operating margin for the full year to be 8%, up from the previous guidance of 6-7%.Additionally, Workday now projects subscription revenues to be between $1.750 billion and $1.757 billion compared with the prior guidance of $1.705 billion to $1.720 billion. Professional services revenues are anticipated to be about $343 million in fiscal 2018.The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at earnings of 65 cents per share on revenues of $2.05 billion.Our TakeWorkday’s revenue growth continues to be driven by high demand for HCM and financial management applications. The company continues to win new customers, which demonstrate high demand for its applications. We believe Workday’s high customer satisfaction rate bodes well for its long-term business strategy.Workday’s HCM suite of applications demonstrates strong growth momentum driven by the transition of organizations to the cloud. Per management, Workday has been selected for core HR by more than 30% of Fortune 500 companies. We, therefore, see much room for expansion here. Also, the company’s traction in the international market is also a positive.The company’s growing clout in the HCM market is evident from market research firm Gartner’s latest “Magic Quadrant for Cloud HCM Suites for Midmarket and Large Enterprises” report where it put Workday in the “Leaders” quadrant.The company’s dominance in the financial management sector is also increasing, which is evident from Gartner’s June 2017 “Magic Quadrant for Cloud Core Financial Management Suites for Midsize, Large, and Global Enterprises” report where Workday was again placed in the “Leaders” quadrant. Moreover, Workday Planning application is also doing well with more than 170 customers including Qualcomm and Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report).Workday’s intention to foray into the platform-as-a-service market by launching the Workday Cloud Platform is expected to further boost the company’s top line in our view.However, increasing competition in the HCM and financial software market could lead to pricing pressure and affect Workday’s margins. Also, increasing marketing spend remains a concern.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderWorkday has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2520,QCOM,"Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report) is expanding its footprint in the self-driving vehicle market. Per Reuters, the company recently revealed collaboration with Alphabet’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) self-driving car unit Waymo.Intel worked with Waymo on the design of its computer platform that enabled autonomous cars to process information in real time. Moreover, Waymo used Intel’s technology for sensor processing, general compute and connectivity in its Chrysler Pacifica hybrid minivans. The company has been using Intel products since 2009.We believe that the collaboration provides a win-win situation for both Intel and Alphabet in the rapidly growing self driving vehicle market.Per Boston Consulting Group’s (BCG) estimates, the autonomous car market will be worth $42 billion by 2025 and $77 billion by 2035. Moreover, by 2035, more than 12 million fully autonomous and 18 million partially autonomous cars are expected to be sold per year globally.  Alphabet & Intel: A Winning CombinationAlphabet through Waymo has been accelerating its push in the self-driving vehicle space predominantly through partnerships with the likes of Intel. Apart from its plans of deploying 600 vehicles from its existing partner, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, Waymo is working on a self-driving vehicle partner program with Lyft. The company is also in talks with Honda Motors to include its vehicles in its fleet.Meanwhile, Intel is no more regarded as a laggard in the self-driving vehicle space. The acquisition of MobilEye now enables this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock to offer almost anything related to self-driving vehicles – cameras, in-car networking, sensor-chips, roadway mapping, cloud software, machine learning and data management.Moreover, in August, the chip-maker announced plans to build 100 “level 4” vehicles to test its self-driving technology. The company also partners automotive manufacturers like BMW and Fiat Chrysler.Intel also formed the Automotive Edge Computing Consortium that aims at developing an ecosystem for connected cars to support emerging services such as intelligent driving, the creation of maps with real-time data and driving assistance based on cloud computing.We believe that Alphabet’s expertise in data collection, storing and analyzing through the effective usage of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools make it a formidable player in the self-driving space. This coupled with Intel’s advanced computing platform as well as sensor product portfolio can be a game-changer for self-driving vehicles market in the long haul.The Intel-Waymo collaboration can actually help in making self-driving vehicles a reality much faster than anticipated by market research firms and analysts. Per market IHS, autonomous car sales will hit 21 million by 2035, at a CAGR of 43% between 2025 and 2035. In the United States, it is anticipated to be 4.5 million autonomous vehicles by 2035.3 Stocks in Focus Post the RevelationThe revelation of Intel-Waymo collaboration significantly impacts the self-driving vehicle market dynamics in our view. Here, we focus on three stocks that can get impacted by intensifying competition from the Intel-Alphabet combination in the race to launch the first fully automated vehicles.NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) – NVIDIA powerful graphic processor units (GPUs), machine learning dominance and map-related collaborations are key positives.

2524,QCOM,"Amid the constant barrage of autonomous driving news, and today’s major Tesla (TSLA  -  Free Report) ruling, one highly popular semiconductor stock has seemingly cruised under the radar in terms of self-driving car coverage: Micron (MU  -  Free Report).On Tuesday, the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board found Tesla at least partially to blame for the first official car-related autopilot death. The NTSB announced that “operational limitations” in Tesla's Autopilot technology played a major role in a deadly May 2016 crash.The committee concluded that it was too easy for a driver to push the limits of Tesla’s current hands-free driving technology and safety measures (also read: Tesla Stock Gains While Self-Driving Tech On Trial).But Micron might be poised to help every major automaker create a secure self-driving vehicle future.Micron’s Self-Driving Exposure Micron markets its memory and data storage solutions to computer manufacturing firms, consumer electronics companies, and telecommunications powers. The semiconductor giant has also invested heavily in vehicle safety technology that could prove to be foundational for a driverless car future.The company’s vehicle-focused semiconductor technology currently helps reduce human driving errors, which includes gesture control interfaces that help detect drowsy and distracted drivers. Micron technology combines multiple vehicle sensors to create more advanced computer “vision” in vehicles. The company’s artificial intelligence also helps cars detect objects and humans that might be in the road and alert the driver.And a key factor in the long-term viability of self-driving car technology will the ability for vehicles to interact with one another. That is why Micron has also started to develop vehicle-to-vehicle communication technology.Micron is also working towards stopping outside, system-level security threats to connected vehicles. This less-talked about, but vitally important, security issue could ultimately lead to successful driverless car ecosystems—or potentially doom the whole industry.On Tuesday, Micron executives partnered with Cisco (CSCO  -  Free Report), Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), NVIDIA (NVDA  -  Free Report), and Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report) to talk about the future of autonomous driving. Micron estimates that by 2020, a single connected vehicle could require at least 1 terabyte of memory storage capacity.The company is already shipping automotive-grade low-power DDR (LPDDR) memories to automotive clients. Micron contends that this technology can enable overall system bandwidths of up to 100 gigabytes per second. However, according to Micron, bandwidths of 300 GB/s will be needed in order to power fully autonomous vehicles down the road.“Micron’s GDDR memory will provide the industry with the first automotive-grade solution that can meet the future performance needs of self-driving vehicles,” Micron VP of Embedded Business Unit Jeff Bader said during the panel.Bottom Line Today’s connected vehicles require vast amounts of memory to power all of their high-tech features. As the long march towards driverless cars continues, memory needs will only grow. The world of self-driving cars can’t start until safety measures improve exponentially, as Tesla Autopilot accidents help prove.Micron is already working towards a future where every car on the road needs to automatically detect everything that is going on. And there can be no long load times when people are allowed to be asleep at the wheel.It seems Micron and its advanced data storage technology is helping pace the race towards driverless car technology.The company is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Shares of Micron are up over 50% year-to-date, and it saw its stock price hit a new 52-week intraday trading high on Tuesday.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

2525,QCOM,"Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM  -  Free Report), the largest manufacturer of wireless chipsets based on baseband technology, is scheduled to report third-quarter fiscal 2017 numbers on Jul 19, after market closes.Last quarter, Qualcomm delivered a positive earnings surprise of 14.29%. The company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the previous four quarters, with an average beat of 14.45%.However, shares of Qualcomm have underperformed the Zacks classified Wireless Equipment industry’s growth over the past three months. The stock inched up 7.86% but failed to beat the industry’s growth of 9.80%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayQualcomm has been facing regulatory proceedings of late. The company continues to receive charges due to unfair business practices and licensing royalty payments. Qualcomm settled a licensing dispute with BlackBerry Limited  by paying $940 million on May 31. Meanwhile, the ongoing $1-billion lawsuit dispute with tech giant Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) is getting bitter by the day, affecting the company’s margins.Aggressive competition in the mobile phone chipset market has been hurting Qualcomm’s profits. The company faces competitive threats from its closest rival, Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report). Intel has been redesigning its chipsets for the mobile computing market. We wait to see if it dents Qualcomm’s sales in the fiscal second quarter.Qualcomm’s updated Snapdragon processors and applications look impressive and will aid the company to retain leadership in the global wireless baseband chipset market. Patent license network deals, tie-up with AT&T Inc. (T) and Ericsson for 5G network trials and the launch of China’s first end-to-end data call bode well for Qualcomm’s growth prospects.Moreover, the company’s foray into areas like automotive, networking and mobile computing are favorable for its growth prospects. We expect such strategic business moves to improve Qualcomm's chipset sales in the to-be-reported quarter.We are also impressed with the company’s efforts to offer a quarterly cash dividend of $0.57 per common share, payable on Sept 20, 2017, to stockholders of record at the closure of business on Aug 30, 2017.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Qualcomm is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Qualcomm has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 67 cents.

2526,QCOM,"NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) recently joined forces with Square Enix to unveil Final Fantasy XV Windows Edition for PC in Gamescom 2017, which is being held in Cologne, Germany. The event will captivate gaming enthusiasts with real-time graphics and physics simulations technologies.Final Fantasy XV is an open world action role-playing video game developed by Square Enix for PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) Windows. The alliance will enable Square Enix's Final Fantasy to include NVIDIA’s GameWorks suite of tools having 4K and 8K high resolution textures along with HDR10. The Final Fantasy series has sold more than 135 million units globally.The collaboration is aimed at bringing an enhanced gaming experience to PCs. This deal is a positive for NVIDIA, as it will help the company gain market share among gaming content developers. We believe that NVIDIA’s GameWorks suite of tools, which improve the visual effects of games, will help to generate additional demand for its graphics technology.Consumers prefer an improved soundscape for gaming along with rich graphics. Thus, NVIDIA’s revenues are likely to benefit significantly if the latest GameWorks technologies succeed in meeting user requirements.In such a scenario, we believe the Final Fantasy XV which is set to release in “early 2018” is likely to increase NVIDIA’s customer base and also aid in garnering additional revenues.Notably, NVIDIA reported splendid second-quarter fiscal 2018 results. Revenues not only surged 56.2% year over year to $2.230 billion, but also comfortably surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.948 billion, as well as management’s projection of $1.95 billion (+/-2%). NVIDIA generated 53% of its revenue from Gaming in the last quarter. Per the company, the strong growth “reflects the vibrant gaming ecosystem, underpinned by continued excitement over our recent launch GPUs and other technologies, great games, and growing interest in e-sports.”Bottom LineNVIDIA continues to be the world’s biggest graphic processing hardware provider for PCs since the past several decades. The company’s efforts toward autonomous vehicle and the AI segment reflect its intention to be the largest player in the self-driving and machine learning arena too.The company remains one of the best performers in the semiconductor space. Shares of NVIDIA have gained 49.1% year to date, significantly outperforming the industry’s 13.1% rally.On the flip side, the secular decline in the PC market has affected many chip makers. NVIDIA’s dependence on the PC market continues, and consequently is being marred by adverse conditions. The preliminary data released by Gartner depicted that PC shipments in the second quarter declined 4.3% year over year to 61.1 million units. This decline marked the 11th straight quarter of year-over-year fall, the longest in the history of the PC industry.Further, Gartner’s forward-looking statements make us a shade cautious about the prospects of the PC industry. The research firm agreed that the recent surge in DRAM prices and short supply of SSD will lead to an escalation in PC prices.Additionally, competition from the likes of Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) and QUALCOMM Inc. (QCOM  -  Free Report) remains a near-term headwind.NVIDIA currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

2529,QCOM,"Rising tensions between the US and North Korea weighed on the markets on Wednesday. The blue-chip index briefly slipped from the 22,000 milestone but pared losses to finish above the psychological level. Decline in the Dow was primarily due to losses made by shares of Disney after the media behemoth announced plans to end its distribution deal with Netflix. Escalating geopolitical uncertainties pushed the defense stocks up but weighed on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) closed at 22,048.70, declining by 0.2% or 36.64 points. The S&P 500 Index (INX) declined less than 0.1%, decreasing 0.9 point to close at 2,474.02. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 6,352.33, slipping 18.13 points or 0.3%. A total of around 6.48 billion shares were traded on Monday, above the last 20-session average of 6.16 billion shares. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 2.29-to-1 ratio. On the Nasdaq, decliners outnumbered advancers by a 2.47-to-1 ratio.Disney Slide Fells DowGeopolitical uncertainty between US and North Korea heightened, weighing heavily on the broader markets. The blue-chip index was dragged down primarily by a plunge in shares of The Walt Disney Co. (DIS  -  Free Report). These losses occurred after the media giant announced its plans to discontinue its distribution deal with Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) and launch its in-house Disney and ESPN steaming services.However, Disney posted better-than-expected earnings for the third straight quarter, as it reported third-quarter fiscal 2017 results. (Read More: Disney (DIS  -  Free Report) Q3 Earnings Top, Unveils Streaming Services)Market Wobbles Due To Geopolitical TensionsThe rising tension between Washington and Pyongyang, after the latter announced plans to attack the Guam Naval base, spiked the defense stocks. Shares of Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report), Raytheon (RTN  -  Free Report), General Dynamics (GD  -  Free Report) and Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report) all increased by 1.7%, 2.6%, 1.1% and 1.2% respectively. The Dow Jones U.S. defense index soared 1.6%.  Despite S&P 500’s declined over the trading day, seven of the index’s eleven primary sectors ended in positive territory, with utilities leading the decliners and followed by consumer-discretionary, telecom and financial sectors. According to experts, the index has been surprisingly calm with small intraday moves. The S&P 500 has gained or lost 0.3% for close to 15 sessions now. On Wednesday, the index overcame a point 13 point deficit incurred earlier in the session. The Nasdaq also ended in the red but was able to pare a 61 point decline suffered earlier in the session.Volatility Rises, But Remains at Record LowsThe CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) hit a one month high despite trading near all time lows. The best gauge of fear in the market- VIX, was up less than a point by 5.8% to 11.60. By all accounts, this has been the quietest stretch of trading since 1965. One estimate puts the current level of volatility at the lowest in 52 years. Since Jul 19, the S&P 500 has not gained or lost 0.5% over a single session. Stocks That Made HeadlinesQualcomm Patent Violation by Apple to be Investigated by ITCThe United States International Trade Commission (ITC) has decided to investigate a complaint filed by chipset manufacturer, Qualcomm Inc.

2530,QCOM,"Cupertino-based tech giant, Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) has garnered the support of Silicon Valley biggies in its nasty legal spat with chipmaker QUALCOMM Incorporated (QCOM  -  Free Report).Per media reports, the Computer and Communications Industry Association (CCIA) – boasting names like Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN), Facebook Inc (FB  -  Free Report), Microsoft Corp, Samsung Electronics,  Netflix Inc, Intel Corp and many more – has filed a petition with the United States International Trade Commission (ITC) to snub Qualcomm's demand of seeking an injunction on iPhone import. CCIA was quoted saying that “Qualcomm is already using its dominant position to pressure competitors and tax competing products. If the ITC were to grant this exclusion order, it would help Qualcomm use its monopoly power for further leverage against Apple, and allow them to drive up prices on consumer devices.”CCIA further added “The ITC has a choice whether to further reward anti-competitive behavior – or to reject this anti-free market, anti-consumer request."" CCIA apparently says banning iPhone (which uses Intel’s chips) import will result in disruption of supply, thereby impacting consumers eventually.At the beginning of this month, per a filing with the ITC, Qualcomm had asked to ban iPhone import from China, accusing Apple of violating six of its patents related to mobile technology. Moreover, the chipmaker had filed another lawsuit against Apple with the U.S. District Court for Southern California, seeking damages for patent violation.Apple Inc. Price Apple Inc. Price | Apple Inc. QuoteThe Apple-Qualcomm dispute started in January this year when Qualcomm was dragged to court by Apple in a $1 billion lawsuit related to licensing royalty payments. In the suit filed, Apple had accused Qualcomm of overcharging for chips and refusing to pay some $1 billion in rebates.In Apr 2017, Qualcomm launched a counterattack on Apple. In a filing, the company elaborated on Apple’s illegal and improper handling of agreements and negotiations with device manufacturers, misleading regulators to attack Qualcomm around the world and not utilizing the full potential of its modem chips in iPhone 7. Apple has started using Intel chips for iPhone 7.In Jun 2017, Apple fired a legal salvo at Qualcomm, accusing the chipmaker of having questionable business practices that helps it get more patent money and suppresses innovation at the same time.A couple of days back, Apple’s suppliers – Compal, Hon Hai Precision, Pegatron and Wistron – had also pitched in, filing a lawsuit against Qualcomm in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California. They have accused Qualcomm of “violating” two sections of the Sherman Act, part of the U.S Antitrust Law in the suit filed. It is a retort to Qualcomm’s lawsuit filed in May this year, in which, the company had accused the four suppliers of holding its royalties/license fees on Apple’s insistence.With so many twists and turns, we remain eager to see how this dispute actually pans out in the coming days.Zacks Rank and Stock Price MovementAt present, Apple carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.In the past one year, shares of Apple have registered growth of 51.2% compared with the industry’s gain of 50.1%.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?

2531,QCOM,"As more information on Qualcomm’s (QCOM  -  Free Report) licensing policies come to light, it’s clear that the company is skating on some pretty thin ice. But given the fact that it is one of the major providers of wireless technology with operations across a number of countries, it’s hard to tell how each of these countries will deal with the situation.There Are Many Factors At Play HereFor one, Qualcomm has the policy of bundling its standard essential patents (SEP) with other proprietary patents and withholding from licensees information about just what they are licensing. So if it licenses patents A, B, C, D, E and F to say Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), which decides it can work around A and create its own solution for B, licensing only what it must, i.e. C, D, E and F, Qualcomm doesn’t give it that option. And because it doesn’t know when it is licensing a standard essential patent (that must be licensed on fair and reasonable terms) or other patent, it is prevented from challenging Qualcomm’s rates.Second, Qualcomm charges royalties on the finished product rather than on the component using its technology, which means that high-priced end products like an iPhone generate more income than lower-priced products like an HTC Desire. So Apple seems justified in its claims that Qualcomm is charging a premium on Apple innovations.Third, Qualcomm charges a 5% royalty on the value of phones that incorporate its own chips and the value of those that incorporate chips from companies licensing its technologies. This means that if a handset maker buys a Qualcomm chip, it still has to pay a 5% royalty because of other unspecified patents that Qualcomm licenses as part of its bundle. Apple says that when it buys a Qualcomm chipset, it doesn’t owe Qualcomm anything at all, but we don’t know yet.Fourth, Qualcomm has a monopoly in mobile chipsets, or basebands that enable phones, tablets, watches, etc to connect to cellular networks. So if a handset maker doesn’t license its technology, it refuses to sell them a chipset. The FTC says that handset makers have not tried litigation because of their fear that Qualcomm would cut chipset supply. Qualcomm also doesn’t license its technology to prospective competitors like Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) and Samsung that could have then made their own supporting chipsets. Here again, because the SEP patents that it is bound to license have been camouflaged under a bundle that contains other patents, taking legal action is complicated. At any rate, Qualcomm contends that its policies haven’t prevented companies like MediaTek, Samsung and Intel from building successful chipset businesses.Bottom LineDespite Apple suppliers and another unnamed licensee (possibly Samsung) stopping payments, Qualcomm’s licensing business grew 48% sequentially in the just-reported third quarter, testimony to the strength of its business model. The lower-margin chip business also did well, growing 12%. If its acquisition of NXP Semiconductors goes off without hiccups (Qualcomm expects to close the deal at the agreed-upon price by year end), it will again be very strongly positioned in emerging technologies.The only fear is that if other smaller players may join the fight, or answer FTC enquiries in a way detrimental to Qualcomm, it may be in for fines or directives. A fine or settlement is actually good as China and Korea agreed to, but it won’t be enough for Apple, which is looking to inject competition into the space. This battle is far from over.Qualcomm has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) but you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

It gained 565,000 postpaid subscribers but lost 350,000 prepaid customers. The company gained 209,000 broadband connections but lost 278,000 pay-TV ones.Apart from earnings news, AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report) is reportedly rebranding its AT&T GoPhone wireless prepaid service to AT&T Prepaid. Customers who activate a new line will receive their 3rd and 12th months of service free. Since prepaid service needs no contract, the free months are offered only to those who maintain continuous service for 12 months. The service will apply to the company’s unlimited bundles offered at $40 and $60 per month.Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report) recently faced data violation, wherein records of 14 million customers were exposed. An employee of NICE Systems left the data on an unsecured Amazon S3 storage server, making it vulnerable to threats from any external party.Management cites a misconfigured security setting on the server as the cause of violation.The company wants access to a significant chunk of wireless consumer data that can be used for ad targeting. To this end, it is exploring the possibility of a data partnership with its peers, such as T-Mobile US, Sprint Corp. (S  -  Free Report), Telefonica SA (TEF  -  Free Report) and Vodafone Group plc.

2533,QCOM,"In the latest development, Apple Inc.’s (AAPL  -  Free Report) suppliers, namely, Compal, Hon Hai Precision, Pegatron and Wistron have reportedly joined the Cupertino-based tech giant in its fight against chipmaker QUALCOMM Incorporated (QCOM  -  Free Report).Per media reports, Apple’s suppliers have filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, accusing Qualcomm of “violating” two sections of the Sherman Act, part of the U.S Antitrust Law. They have claimed that Qualcomm continues to extract additional licensing money over assembling of iPhones.The lawsuit is a retort to Qualcomm’s lawsuit filed in May this year, in which, the company had accused the four suppliers of holding its royalties/license fees on Apple’s insistence. Back then, Qualcomm’s president had said “despite Apple's claims against Qualcomm, Apple suppliers remain contractually obligated to pay royalties to Qualcomm under their license agreements with us, including for sales of iPhones to Apple.”The Story So FarThe Apple-Qualcomm dispute started in January this year when Qualcomm was dragged to court by Apple in a $1 billion lawsuit related to licensing royalty payments. In the suit filed, Apple had accused Qualcomm of overcharging for chips and refusing to pay some $1 billion in rebates.Later on, Apple also asked its manufacturing partners – Foxconn, Pegatron, Wistron and Compal Electronics – to stop paying Qualcomm and agreed to indemnify them if Qualcomm took them to court.In Apr 2017, Qualcomm launched a counterattack on Apple by mentioning the value of its invented technologies, and their contribution and share in the industry through its licensing program.

Qualcomm has accused Apple of infringing six of its patents related to mobile technology and filed another lawsuit against the company with the U.S. District Court for Southern California seeking damages for patent violation.Qualcomm Revenues Take HitRecently, Qualcomm reported its third-quarter fiscal 2017 earnings, wherein both the company’s earnings and revenues topped estimates driven by strength in its semiconductor business. However, on a year-over-year basis, Qualcomm’s revenues fell 11% due to the dispute with Apple and its suppliers. This has resulted in loss of a chunk of licensing fees. Consequently, profits fell nearly 40%.Qualcomm has excluded QTL revenues pertaining to the sale of Apple products by the latter’s contract manufacturers/other licensee involved in the legal spat, in its guidance for the fourth quarter.The company expects earnings for the fourth quarter to be around 75–85 cents, a sharp decline of 34–41% on a year-over-year basis. Revenues are expected in a range of $5.4–$6.2 billion compared with $6.2 billion earned in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016.Touching upon the dispute with Apple, Qualcomm CEO, Steve Mollenkopf said “Our products and technologies continue to enable the global smartphone industry, and we are expanding into many exciting new product categories, including automotive, mobile computing, networking and Internet of Things (IoT). We believe that we hold the high ground with regard to the dispute with Apple, and we have initiated new actions to protect the well-established value of our technologies.”This dispute is unlikely to have an end in the near term.Zacks Rank and Stock Price MovementAt present, Apple carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).
